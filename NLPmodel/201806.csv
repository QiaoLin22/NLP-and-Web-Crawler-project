"First poster for the upcoming film ""Glass""",85735,8ut00l,https://i.redd.it/mlhc1es2wx611.jpg,4541,1530277818.0,,"Can I just say I love how David Dunn is chained to the floor? If the doctors at the hospital don't believe he's super strong, they sure are taking a LOT of precautions to make sure. &&I love that Willis is still wearing the rain jacket&&M. Night Shyamalan's Infinity War&&Great poster. Man, I forgot how shredded McAvoy got for Split and this.&&Color was a big thing in Unbreakable. Glass was purple, Bruce Willis was green, most other colors were muted. Trying to think back to Split, was color a factor in that? Was the Horde ever represented by yellow like in the poster? Just curious if they'll bring that into this new movie.&&[deleted]&&Ok. That is a good poster. &&This poster makes me wanna see Unbreakable again and Split for the 1st time.&&Interesting that David Dunn (Bruce Willis) seems to be locked up&&I will never forget the visceral feel of Willis' weightlifting scene in Unbreakable. It was the first time I really felt the strength of a hero in film, not just lifting up cars and tossing them around like toys. You could feel how strong he was and I was right there with him with how excited I was for his discovery.&&[Rotated poster](https://i.imgur.com/saVqjXU.jpg)&&Please, please don't fuck this one up. I want a great ending to a great trilogy.

And for the love of God don't let sleepwalking phone it in Willis show up.&&Wonder why Bruce's character is the one chained up? &&I love it despite yet another misalignment of actors' names with their image.&&Oh man this poster looks incredible. I remember seeing early reviews for Split praising its “unguessable” plot twist and thinking that anything could be guessed but boy was I wrong. Shyamalan created a twist that literally changed the genre of the film that preceded it from psychological thriller to supervillain origin movie, connected its mythos to a completely different film released years earlier, and confirmed that it was the secret second movie in a trilogy, all just by showing Bruce Willis’ fucking face. That twist should be studied by college students in a decades time. The sheer complexity of it blows my mind and this movies’ gonna be awesome welcome back M night!! &&M. Night Shyamalan is allowed to put his name on posters again?&&Never thought I'd see the Shyamalan Cinematic Universe&&I have yet to watch Split. I have watched Unbreakable multiple times but I was always afraid Split wouldn't live up to it so I subconsciously always went with a different movie. Might be the time to finally catch up. &&Is that McAvoy's real body (in the reflection)? When did he get so hench?!&&They Filmed a few scenes on my block in south philly.   I got off the subway and wondered why there were hordes of people.  Then a dude turns to me and tells me Bruce Willis and Samuel l are filming a movie. 

It was dope.  Can't wait&&Im proud of M. Night.  He went from being constantly being shit on back to greatness&&Anya Taylor Joy is returning, that's all I need. She is a screen goddess in the making.
&&You guys...Mr. Glass is standing.&&""Unbreakable Split Glass.""&&I'm guessing that Mr Glass is going to manipulate James McAvoy's character to do his bidding.&&I really hope Bruce Willis yells ""You have failed this city!"" before the final battle.&&Unbreakable!  They alive dammit!&&In Unbreakable, Elijah's first comic book [portrayed a Superhero fighting a Beast in the form of a man.](https://i.redditmedia.com/_DpWRyqQt8hLX47sSRJ2aHcJ6MFu_ni3Hr85ITBSTAA.jpg?w=456&s=e8306c693e1f3af14a8ffa77db6f0c85)

""This is from Fritz Campion's own library. This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968. It's a classic depiction of good versus evil. Notice the square jaw of Slayer, common in most comic heroes. And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's head to his body. This again is common, but only in villains.The thing to notice about this piece... the thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures.""

Since this was the first comic that Elijah ever got from his mother, it could have been his favorite, or at least one he was fascinated by the history of.

It also explained why he was so pissed off when he found out the original sketch was getting bought for a 4-year old kid.

Now all of his dreams are going to come true.
&&I'll never forget the time I downloaded what I thought was M Night's Split, and about an hour into a movie about a girl with a thing for bowlers, I thought ""This isn't scary at all!""&&[This makes no sense if you line up all 3 posters, the glass should crack across all 3 movies.](https://www.google.com/search?q=unbreakable+movie+poster&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=HWVZLNHFyqFeLM%253A%252CPS8lN_SluY5UMM%252C_&usg=__QVyqM18GeQiNuf7-ZgJxu_3fY7o%3D&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlz8Dw-vjbAhUHm1kKHU8XBIgQ9QEIKzAA#imgrc=_&spf=1530278296982)&&That's honestly one of the greatest posters I've ever seen.&&I'm not very good with computers.  Could anybody please flip this picture so I can see what they look like without having to turn my monitor upside down or hang from the ceiling like a bat please?  Thank you.&&I want it framed already &&Unbreakable was one of my favorite movies growing up. Really hope this is a worthy successor.&&Let's not forget that McAvoy's character's father died in the same train crash that David Dunn survived in and that that'll surely become a way that either stops The Beast or sets him off. &&I absolutely loved Split, even apart from the Unbreakable tie in. Really excited for this. &&McAvoy is an absolute unit. &&The ending of Unbreakable is still one of the greatest things I've ever seen, in a movie filled with fantastic moments. I certainly joined the  Shyamalan hate train after his next few movies and went into Split with 0 expectations. 

So happy that Split was good and that M Night has the chance to deliver on the conclusion of the original superhero trilogy. &&That's a pretty great poster. I hope this movie expands the world a little bit though.&&I'm going to be completely honest here. I still have never seen Split. I got really baked and was psyched to watch it. I found it on Kodi and I knew only that it was about someone with MPD. The movie started and it was people bowling and shit. I'm sitting there the whole time like ""is this all his personalities or something? Where the fuck is James Mcavoy?"" And the credits rolled with no reveal. It was only then that I realized I had just spent about 2 hours watching a romantic comedy centered around bowling called Split.&&N Might Shimasham has really been putting out some good movies lately. I thought split and be visit were both fantastic.&&""Glass is the most ambitious crossover event in history""&&[deleted]&&I just realized his name alliterates like other superheros.  &&[deleted]&&Was he super strong? It's been a long time since I've seen Unbreakable. I thought he was just invulnerable. You'd think Horde would be chained up since he can become The Beast&&I'm actually wondering why Dunn is chained? He wasn't a prisoner or a mental patient at all.&&If they believed he was super-strong, it seems like they'd use something other than completely standard shackles to restrain him. This just shows that they think he's dangerous, unpredictable, and/or an escape risk. Nothing more.&&There's water&&Why is he shackled to the floor though?&&Yeah. But his feet don't match up with his reflection as well as the others&&Mr. Glass snaps his fingers and half of his bones turn to dust. &&Really gutted I never saw Unbreakable before Split. I was always meaning to and I saw a few clips of the film that showed Bruce Willis and had the main theme in it. I saw Split, thought the music in the ending sounded familiar and then when Bruce Willis appeared I was just completely shocked. It had an effect on me but it would have been so much better if I saw Unbreakable. Having now seen it, this is a crossover I can really get behind and I look forward to seeing what happens with the characters after we saw the origin of the hero and the villain.&&Its going to be pretty great when its revealed that all the characters are actually stuck in the Village and theyre all under hypnosis from aliens from Signs and they get help from whatever the fuck was in Lady in the Water except in the end everyone dies because the trees killed them or whatever.


I vomited in my mouth a little bit.&&Mr Dunn, I don't feel so good...&&He’s more shredded in this than he was in Split. It’s fucking ill. Good god, he became a beast. &&Thought that was Jason Statham for a second&&I think i'm always skeptical of one when they're portrayed so giant.  McAvoy is 5 ft 5"" while Jackson is 6 ft 2"" and Willis 6ft, respectively.  Yet in the poster they make it seem they're of equal (nearly equal) stature.  Which if McAvoy we're so giant then he'd be closer to Dave Bautista whom is around a 6ft 2"" height.    


I mean, McAvoy is still jacked (and it's impressive) but it's crazy how well they can make them seem massive.  Same thing with Robert Downey Junior.  He's 5ft 7"" but has to be portrayed as 6ft something because the comic book Stark is taller and every Chris (Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt) as well as other Avengers are all 6ft and up.    


Movies are fun. &&Pennywise better [watch out. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/977019/It-Chapter-2-set-photo-James-McAvoy-Bill-Adult-Losers-club-Pennywise-Clown-It-movie/amp) &&I can’t believe he didn’t get an Oscar nom for that performance. &&In Split he wears a yellow jacket as well a a beige jacket. Also a lot of the underground scenes have orange warm tones.&&I know when he was the young kid, he wore yellow.&&[deleted]&&Hedwig was yellow (innocent/coward), Dennis was gray/muted colors because he was all about being inoffensive to Kevin's mother, Patricia was beige with black underneath at first (calming but unreadable at a deeper level) and then later on wore red to show off her inner bloodlust. The Beast's colors were literally flesh and blood.&&Hedwig wore a yellow and black jacket. &&Looking through the split discussion thread I found this picture of the first comic Mr. Glass gets in unbreakable. It pictures a GREEN superhero fighting a YELLOW beast.

http://imgur.com/iv7EFcM&&Now that you say that, I do remember some of the personalities wearing red and yellow. Specifically the personality that acts as a lady and the little boy, but yellow/organge/redish themes are def present.&&That's a good point. I'll keep an eye out for that when I next see Split. 

Thanks for bringing it up.&&Was it different colors for each of his personalities? Color is always a thing with M. Knight movies. &&If I recall, when there were first talks of a sequel to Unbreakable, he said he was planning to use a villain that he had to cut out of Unbreakable. I imagine that's The Beast. So I think he had it planned out to a degree, maybe not as a trilogy, but he definitely made Split work, let's hope Glass is the same.&&Honestly, this is all the advertising I need to convince me to see this. This is truly a fantastic poster. &&So what are their powers again it's been a while since I saw the films?

Jackson is an evil genius.

Willis can see people's misgivings and is immortal? 

Mcavoy is immortal/armour and strong?&&Why not put the names in the order of actors in the photo though? &&I haven't seen either and just cleared my Friday night plans to watch both. Some scenes of Glass were filmed outside of my apartment (I actually had to argue with a PA and show him my license with my address to get into my apartment) so it'll be cool to watch it and be like hey I live there!&&Split's great, check it out!&&Split was amazing. I have never seen Unbreakable but I want to as well. &&I watched Split last night for the first time. It was great. Well acted and paced. It felt more polished than M. Night's earlier work but held true to his style.&&I avoided Split just  cause it did not seem like my thing. Not a big psycho movie guy. When I heard about Glass I knew I had to see it so I could see Glass. It was fantastic.&&[I thought someone said the movie starts with all 3 men in an asylum-and that they all merely think they have these superpowered alter egos](#spoiler)&&Right?&&I like the deleted scene that takes place shortly after. He goes to the athletes gym at the stadium he works at. Starts putting on inhuman amounts of weights to look for his actual limit. When he's done he sits up and the whole room is silent with all these young athletes just staring. He quietly gets the hell out of there.&&My favorite scene was the one near the end, when David Dunn let his kid read the news of his heroism in the papers. No dialogue, but pretty damn powerful.&&There's a [deleted scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIP0iqySMLo) showing Willis doing a second round of weight lifting at the University gym.

I'm glad they cut it—it's fun, but it's also duplicative and doesn't add very much. But it is neat to watch all the beefy football players staring at him open-mouthed as he benches 495 lbs (10x 45lb plates plus the 45lb bar—or ~225kg).

edit - on re-watch, i'd forgotten he puts clamps on the bar. iirc bar clamps are usually 2.5 lbs each, so it's an even 500 lbs total.&&The cut to the kid hiding got a huge laugh in the cinema.

That's some great film making. A simple edit and it plays the audience like a fiddle. &&That was a great scene. Another one, emotionally, was the scene where he silently picks up his wife (all in one long shot zoomed in on her face and his back) and gently carries her upstairs and puts her in their bed. &&McAvoy looking absolutely jacked &&The real MVP. Thanks, dude.&&I'm super excited for SSALG!&&Willis usually brings his all whenever he works on a M. Night project, so hopefully the same applies here. 

It would be nice if he was really into this project, like Ford was in Blade Runner 2049. &&Trilogy? What movie did they make after Unbreakable, I only ever saw the original!&&Cutscene to man being ran over by riding mower&&Wait, there was a second one?&&I was the double for Bruce Willis on this film and I assure you that this is epic Bruce. M. Night has such a lovable and strong presence that makes the actors want to be amazing and they all are.  IMHO, this will go down as one of M.Night’s greatest film ever. &&Guess they are kinda aware of what he can do&&He did kill that murderer guy in Unbreakable.&&That’s the twist &&Not that it matters or anything but I honestly expected Bruce Willis to get top billing because the ending of Split gave me the impression that the sequel will mainly focus on Willis hunting down McAvoy with Samuel L Jackson as a backdrop but vital role 

I wonder if Willis means less to the major Studios now&&This is intended though. The alignment of actors' names is such that the most paid is in the first place, then decreasing&&Yep. That was it for me! Seeing Dennis in the end blew my fucking mind. Not because it was THE twist, but the reveal that it was a sequel. That soundtrack at the end was fucking awesome&&I feel like I’ve done myself a bit of a disservice reading this far into the comments, but on the other hand I wouldn’t have even known Spit exists if not for all these wonderful spoilers. Guess I’ll just have go in with willful amnesia &&Dare I say it's his best twist? Better than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable?&&Out of the loop&&i’m sure the jury was split on this decision&&It's a completely different kind of movie, a different genre. Just FYI.&&Do it! Very different vibe from Unbreakable, but a strong, suspenseful film.&&Method acting. &&Seriously...He looks massive. I want his regimen. &&I don't think there is a chance in hell that isn't photoshopped extensively.&&Absolute Unit &&It's always nice seeing directors who try to think outside the box and actually release original movies. 

Not just cookie cutter hollywood bullshit prequels/sequels/remakes&&Split was very good, but I don't think he's out of the woods yet. Needs to deliver on this to be considered great again.&&I have always loved the guy (probably because I have avoided some of the films people said were terrible) so I'm also really glad to see him being back in the masses good graces.&&She's gorgeous.&&i'm glad to see her returning. i haven't seen anybody mention this yet but i wonder if her character is going to be 'the horde's weakness and perhaps david dunn recuits her to find him. also, this is all speculation of course, what if dunn shakes her uncles hand and finds out he's an evil pedo and kills him? freeing her in the process&&>Anya Taylor Joy

His bones break very easily, they can still heal though. &&He was in a wheel chair because he broke his legs from what I recall, not because he can't use them.&&And the twist will be that McAvoy's character was in control the whole time, making him the mastermind behind the whole thing. &&That or the ""hero and villain team up"" trope, done in the same style as Unbreakable.&&I would love this as long as he doesn't have a hacker secretary who ends up controlling the whole film at the end......&&Okay Oliver

He just sees evil on a graphic and emotional level. I could see how this could lead him to be seen a villain.

The bastard pulled me back in.&&I remember being caught completely off guard, and felt like screaming in the movies ""DO YOU NOT REALIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING?"" ahah&&Unbreakable is easily Shyamalan's best film...&&>a beast

Wrong X-man &&I never though that I could think that James McAvoy could kick my ass. &&Is that actually him? I thought it was CGI.&&He became the Beast.&&Before looking at it upside down, I assumed the bald, jacked guy was Bruce Willis.&&Fantastic performance, I felt very uncomfortable the first time watching that movie.&&He gives the girls yellow flowers&&Yeah, he played around with a lot of blue/orange tones in connection to Kevin's blue/orange sense of morality.&&That's one of the ongoing theories about Kevin Wendell Crumb&&[deleted]&&This added with that both set up films were really good. Unbreakable feels like the realest superhero film to me. 

Edit. 
For everyone asking, Split (with James McAvoy) is the other set up film. He's the middle jacked af man in the poster. It's also worth checking out, Bruce Willis has a brief scene in it connecting it together. 

Edit again. 
There's only 2 films that set up this one (Glass), they are unbreakable and split. Both great movies. &&This poster makes me want to finally find time to watch Split.&&Only change would be to swap the names so they matched up with the photos.&&I love the colors. I love the kinetic energy. I am ready! That tagline is great.&&Jackson is an evil genius, but has brittle bone syndrome.

McAvoy has split personality but each personality manifests physical changes in his body. One of the personalities, the Beast, has superhuman strength, speed, healing, and can crawl on walls/ceilings.

Willis can see people's sins when he touches them. He has superhuman strength. He is extremely durable, to the point of possibly being indestructible. He has never been sick after a near-drowning incident during his childhood. He may have a weakness to water due to the drowning incident, or he may just be susceptible to drowning like everyone else.&&Jackson made up for his weak physical condition by developing a brilliant evil mind and the will necessary to execute his plans.

Willis is far stronger than a man his size, age should be as well as having a high resistance to injury -He survived a train wreck and we saw him tear the door off car to save his girlfriend/future wife. For some reason he can be drowned.  He also possesses a tactile based clairvoyance that allows him to see a person's evil deeds. This last ability manifested after he started embracing his powers.

McAvoy has severe dissociative personality disorder -One of those personalities sees himself as a powerful beast that is strong, fast, can climb walls and highly resistant to injury. In this case that belief actually manifests those abilities into existence with some very unsettling consequences.

EDITED for clarity&&Bruce Willis can lift paint cans and is allergic to water.  
Sam Jackson is really bad at falling down.  
McAvoy can change into a monster, a small boy, a women or a guy with diabetes sometimes. &&If I remember right, Mcavoy's multiple personalities can actually physically manifest and change his body, so when the ""beast"" personality comes out, he gets super jacked and basically is beast from Xmen but not blue. &&IIRC, Jackson has Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which he has very brittle bones. He's the counter to Bruce Willis since they are on opposite sides of the spectrum related to damage.

Split is in my queue, and I can't comment on all of MacAvoy's abilities.&&Fantastic question. Short answer, movie politics. Actors want to have top billing.

https://youtu.be/yQhC1Kfrs3o&&[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhC1Kfrs3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhC1Kfrs3o)&&I seriously envy you getting to see these two films for the first time. I’d give pretty much anything to experience that again. Have fun!&&>just cleared my Friday night plans

Hmm let’s see here. I’ll move masturbation to right before crying myself to sleep. Then move drinking alone and nostalgically texting my ex to Saturday night. There we go, all set!&&Do it! It’s a fantastic film, especially if you like comic book movies. &&That wouldn't make any sense tho bc in Split the main captive sees McAvoy's character climb on the wall and is just as baffled as the audience.&&That's like that episode of Buffy where it's said she's just a crazy in some clinic somewhere.&&This would ruin everything in my opinion.&&Seems like Bruces would be really easy to verify though.&&I had never seen that before, thanks for putting it out there.

[Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIP0iqySMLo) for anyone else who hasn't seen it.&&is it on any released dvd/Blu-ray version or just an extra released after the movie? would love to see all the extras and deleted scenes!&&Shyamalan has always had a keen sense of how to use silence in films to build a moment.  He likes to let the scene tell the story.  I think the actors like it because they can flex their abilities a bit without just regurgitating dialogue.  He even got Jackson to be somewhat restrained the first time around, but his facial expressions and body language told a lot of the story(like the scene in the comic shop when the clerk was trying to kick him out)&&He doesn't re-rack his weights, thus showing he's the *real* villain of the movie&&it makes it seem like he is flying like Superman, the way how smooth and effortless the movement is.&&""I had a bad dream.""

That moment was great because earlier he said he knew he was falling out of love when he had a nightmare and he didn't wake her up for comfort. It's one of the best moments of the movie.&&Looks more like Jason statham &&Absolute unit&&Hollywood Roid cycles/training is top notch&&Or like Willis in 12 Monkeys. &&The difference in Ford's acting when he actually cares is really apparent. The Force Awakens, he kind of just walked through the role. Blade Runner 2049, he actually acted.&&Yeah, exactly. I want him to bring everything he got and hopefully he's aware this isn't Die Hard 47 so he'll do just that.&&Split&&Looks like you need to catch up on Split, which was released early last year. It made $275 Million on $9 Million budget, and spent three weeks at Number 1!

Go in blind, and hopefully you have a blast with it like I did!&&I had to look it up but it is “Split” and “Unbreakable” and this film connects them apparently&&Hunger Games &&Yeah, but isn't McAvoy's character also really powerful?&&Samuel L. Jackson was Bruce Willis the whole time.&&Bruce Willis was Samuel L. Jackson all along!&&That dude in the hair piece?  That's Bruce Willis the entire time!&&What a tweest&&The order is even simpler than that -- it's whatever they (or more likely their agents) negotiate.&&He had a series of flop/criticized movies. Thereby the brand value of his name fell. But he bounced back with ""Split"" i feel. Edit: Thanks to all the people pointing out ""The Visit"". I haven't followed M Night closely, so I will definitely check out this particular movie.&&His name used to be on posters to attract people to come, but after a run of mixed/poorly received movies they wouldn’t put his name on posters in case it turned people away&&He made some right stinkers, to the point where his name turned people off seeing a film. &&His name was more or less completely removed from all marketing for After Earth, even though he was the got dang director/co-writer, because they predicted nobody would want to go see it if they know it was a Shyamalan joint going into it&&I'm fine with that, I just want it to be a good movie.&&[deleted]&&It’s a mixture of working out for at least two hours a day leading up to the shoot and probably some roids. &&Agreed. I know he was pretty big in Split, but he's also 5'7. &&And he's at a disadvantage because he needs to have a story worth telling, here.

Unbreakable is a great stand-alone origin story for a hero and a villain. Split's a great origin story for a dragon... but now it has to go somewhere interesting while staying in that relatively grounded world that's been established, and we need new things about the characters that can be explored (ie: it's not enough for Mr. Glass and the Beast to team up to 'do evil' and Mister Security to 'thwart them').

There's a reason sequels tend to suck, and I just hope the story here is well thought out and worthy of continuing the characters' stories.&&I personally don't think his flops take anything away from some of the great movies he's delivered. In the scheme of things he'll be fine. There's plenty of all-time-great directors with absolutely shitty movies on their resume. 

If anything he'll be remembered for having his own style, for better or worse.&&wtf I was about to call ya'll out for calling a 15 year old girl gorgeous and a goddess but turns out she is 22?! Wow that is the youngest looking 22 year old I've ever seen &&Unbreakable made a point of superheroes having alliterative names, and she's Casey Cooke. &&Thank you for that. It’s been a while and I’ve come to associate him with the chair.&&Secretary: ""Uh-Oh. Mr. Glass has hacked into the building security systems. He overclocked the mainframe and locked me out. I'm going to try run an ipconfig and crash the system""&&THESE males are STRONG as HELL.&&Thank you kind Australian Redditor&&Put YOU in a wheelchair. &&""You're a big guy""

""For Dunn.""&&Jessica Jones, Scott Summers, Bruce Banner, Steven Strange, Matt Murdock&&No, a brief glimpse into a padded room where a man with a large round scar on his disfigured head is seen from behind arguing with someone named ""Tyler"".&&Also, that flashback with him saving his wife from the car crash.  He is pulling on the corner of a steel car door like crazy and it's not even moving.  He realizes he can't find a way to get her out of the car and starts panicking.  Then he pulls on the door some more and suddenly the corner bends like a sheet of aluminum and he just fucking rips the door off like a gorilla.  The strength required to bend a steel door back in on itself is insane.  You would need a hydraulic powered machine to exert that much force from a standstill.

He is as strong as he needs to be in each situation.&&I used to use him as a metaphor for how stupid this one particular employee was. She seemingly had no bottom. When you thought ok THIS is it, she is THIS stupid, she would go and outdo herself every time. She was my little version of Bruce Willis in a basement pumping iron. &&In the flashback of his car accident it also shows him ripping the door off his car to save the woman who would become his wife. &&Damn I'll have to watch it again. I don't remember that part&&His hero costume is a white vest and cheesy one liners &&The Amazing Adventures of Poncho Man!&&I mean he did kill a guy and is considered a vigilante so maybe he got caught or something.&&I'm guessing he got locked up for being a vigilante.&&Those chains don’t stand a chance&&The 2 movies mentioned are directly related to this though. That and we all know Airbender blew&&Literally unwatchable&&""Anywhere in my general vicinity would probably do it.""&&The enemy can't hit your weakspot if everything's your weakspot&&""You should've aimed for the bicep...""&&It works for Deku.&&Yep! 

IIRC M. Night wanted to make a sequel to it but could never get the support needed to do it (could be wrong) so years later he made Split, which no one knew was occurring in the same cinematic universe as Unbreakable until the very end of the film. Glass will tie it all together.&&Yeah, at the very end of Split they have a little cameo scene and mention Mr Glass from Unbreakable. 

It is, as far as I know, the only thing that ties the worlds together. &&Yeah, unfortunately you've just had an amazing plot twist spoiled for you by skipping Split. Watch it anyway, it's a really solid film on its own.&&Part of THIS series, in fact.&&Unbreakable i'd say is his best movie that I can watch alone.

Signs or Sixth Sense though? Those are pretty damn great.&&Oh, my stars and garters. &&I really like James McAvoy as professor x. I hope I see him in more X-men movies&&Fuck off Logan&&Most actors these days keep hella fit and some of them have fight training, a lot of actors I used to think were kind of pushovers could most certainly whoop my ass back to daycare. Jake Gyllenhaal comes to mind. &&It is him but there are heavy CGI effects applied to the photo.   He's definitely in good shape  but not super jacked.  &&I thought the same thing! I thought it was a picture of his old self from Unbreakable (since we're seeing Sam as his old self also). The chains didn't make sense to me.&&I'd be pretty impressed if Bruce was looking like that at his age. &&Kevin Wendell Crum is the dudes name. There are a few theories about, one of them is that Kevin's father died on the same train accident that David was in, thereby having his split personalities indirectly be created by Elijah. I'm not sure though, it's all speculation at this point really, and I'm not one to subscribe to fan theories tbh.&&The name is Horde&&It's legitimately one of my favourite films.

I think I just loved how it made me think ""...I guess that was a superhero film y'know"" *after* you started thinking about what you just watched.&&It’s so underrated. It’s a terrific film but most people don’t recognize how awesome it is. &&what’s the other set up film?&&OMG, thanks for the reminder! I forgot about Split. Really need to see that soon. Exciting that it's actually a set up film. 

For all M.Night Shamalon's faults, he is a great storyteller when he hits his stride. You can tell the difference when he puts his heart into it.&&James McAvoy is fantastic.&&It’s actually really good. I saw it in the theater and was pleasantly surprised.&&Go do it, it's fucking great. &&I think that those details are negotiated between the studio and the actors/agents.&&Well, the movie currently has potential energy. Once it is released, it will have kinetic energy.&&>He is extremely durable, to the point of possibly being indestructible

Or to the point of being unbreakable. &&But why is Willis in chains?&&In unbreakable they say he is actually weak to it, so is glass. &&> One of those personalities sees himself as a powerful beast that is strong, fast and highly resistant to injury.

The personality actually manifests physically; it doesn't just see itself as powerful, it *is* powerful.&&This is the only correct answer.&&[deleted]&&Sam Jackson is amazing at falling down stairs!
He's just really bad at falling down stairs without getting hurt.&&>really bad at falling down

Thank you for giving me an early morning laugh.&&Think of bad guy Moonknight&&Watch it immediately, very good movie.&&Movie starts out that way, flashbacks to Dunn chasing the beast and beating him to a pulp then getting arrested and when questioned on the vigilantism explains he's unbreakable and is admitted to an asylum along with beast and glass.

It's not that they don't have these powers but that this is the most likely outcome for anyone who claims they do.&&And also the part at the end of Split where Dunn is just hanging out in a diner.&&Also McAvoy took a shotgun blast to the chest and is shown laughing later that it didn't go all the way through.&&Indeed, good episode.&&Just about every single sci-fi show I've ever watched has one of those episodes.&&Or that episode of of supernatural where they go to an alternate universe where supernatural is a show and they are the actors.  So the actors are playing characters that have to pretend to be actors that are playing themselves as characters. &&I feel like it'd be more like finding out the big secret of her little sister. I don't want to spoil anything so people might mix it up but.. you know leading up to this with 2 movies and beign shown these things then being told it's not real.

I think the clinic was a different one than this one? Not sure I binged the whole series over a few weeks so seasons and eps kind of mesh together.&&I really hope that isn’t the twist at the end..&&[deleted]&&Not really. We don't even really know the extent of his powers. 

He was able to bench a large amount and take a beating. And he could read minds of feel crimes of something. So what's the threshold between normal and super?&&Thats a cool scene but i can see why it was cut. Feels a little redundant after the basment scene&&RACK YOUR WEIGHTS BRUCE!  
You're not _that_ special.&&For anyone wondering, that’s 495 pounds&&It's on both my DVD and blu ray. The DVD was released back when studios were piling extras in to their bonus features sections to help steal people away from vhs.&&Also, the cinematography is great. Slow pans back and forth. The angles, long cuts...the music is great too! &&[deleted]&&In awe at the size of this lad&&Without a doubt his best performance. &&[deleted]&&Same with Willis though. He's been sleepwalking through most of his roles for the last ~10 years probably.

I watched Marauders and it was just sad seeing how little he seemed to give a shit. &&People going in to watch Split expecting a sequel to Unbreakable are going to be very confused for most of the movie lol. &&Bruce Willis had a cameo at the end.  He says

""Mister glass"" right before the credits.

Which is exactly how unbreakable ended.&&Only when ""the Beast"" comes out. They may not know this yet.&&Enough is enough!  I have had it with these motherfucking terrorists in the motherfucking building!&&That dude in the hairpiece? That was Bruce Willis the whole time!&&[deleted]&&Yeah it's possible an actor will take less money to be first billed.&&Good bot&&And it was still bad without his name on the poster. &&[deleted]&&That it is. Enjoy.&&I was hesitant too. Watch it, it's very good.&&Yes.  But the protein is steroids and the drink is an injection.&&Fight milk, for sure. &&Yeah i wouldn't be surprised if he cycled and did a dehydration period to get just absolutely thick solid and tight. I hope he keeps posting pics so he can show us just how thick solid and tight he can get.

EDIT For the uninitiated:

>Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation. &&I was the same way, but seeing him up with the cane reminded me. Most of the on set pictures still have him in the chair, though. &&""Oh no!  The Operating System is virtual!

It's when he starts to figure out he's got powers (or whatever you want to call it)&&Yippie Kayak, Other Buckets!&&More of a white wife-beater. &&Yipee ki yay&&maybe they somehow all end up in the same psychiatric ward together?&&Maybe he’s deliberately got himself put into the same asylum/prison as the other two?&&I'm a huuuge fan of *Unbreakable*.  Saw it in the theatre when it was first released,  and own it on DVD.

I wasn't aware that *Split* occurred in the *Unbreakable* universe.  I haven't seen it.

Is *Split* good?  

**EDIT:**

Thanks for the recommendations!
 
I've purchased the streaming version of *Split* through Amazon,  and will probably watch it this weekend with a fellow geeky friend who was already scheduled to come in from out of town to binge the 2nd season of *Westworld* with me.

**EDIT 2**: 

Imma peace out of this thread now.  Spoilers are starting to show up in the comments.

Thanks!

\*Skull caves in\*&&PLUS ULTRA!!!!&&If Shamalamanam makes this movie and makes it G O O D, he might just deserve forgiveness for his former sins.&&M. Night Shyamalan says that Kevin from split was originally supposed to be in unbreakable but he couldn’t figure out a good way to weave his story in or something like that. There’s a few theories out there, like in split Kevin’s dad left on a train, that train was the same one that crashed in the beginning of unbreakable killing everyone except for David Dunn. Another one is that the mom and boy that  David runs into, and senses some abuse from, at the stadium in Unbreakable is Kevin. We’ll see if anything else is revealed when the movie comes out. &&It’s been theorized that McAvoy’s character lost his father in the same train incident that was caused by Mr. Glass, so there’s another potential connection. &&Fun Fact : That ending scene kept getting bigger.  Originally, it was just the music.  Then it was the music and a news reporting hinting at the orignal.  Then it was those two and flying Bruce Willis out in a helicopter for the scene. &&Having the twist spoiled is WHY I saw Split, so there's something to say for that.&&Yeah I didn't realize there was any connection at all until the very end of Split. It really threw me for a loop.&&stars and stripes!&&Right?! The first movie I ever saw with him was Bubble Boy, so now any movie with Jake Gyllenhaal I think of that skinny little shit. It was a weird moment when I realized that Bubble Boy can kick the ever loving shit out of me. &&I'm a huge believer in the theory, it just makes too much sense honestly. Both Unbreakable's hero and Split's villain come to full realization of their power in an Amtrak train.

Hedwig also said his dad went on a train and never came back, and we also later see Kevin bringing flowers to the train and laying them there before he undergoes his transformation into the Beast. If this is the case, then Kevin's split personality disorder manifested itself as a direct result of Mr. Glass's actions in the first film. He essentially created both Dunn and The Horde and I believe we will see him dealing with the repercussions of that in this film. 

It also wouldn't surprise me if the little boy in Unbreakable that was being abused by the mother in the red coat was Kevin, considering that Kevin mentioned being abused growing up and that his Patricia personality wears red just like his mother did (if that was indeed him and his mother).&&It's funny that people's reactions have changed. When it was released, I remember it being met with a degree of ire.&&Like Ethan Hawkes interview on Colbert of great movies. Great movies are ones that begin when you leave the theater. &&I loved it but my friend I took hated it. She raged about it after we saw it.&&I can see why some would hate it to be fair. You don't expect the heroes origin to be that drawn out for a whole movie. Like the whole of Unbreakable is like the opening 20-40 minutes of every other superhero movie, which makes it feel extra unique and grounded.&&Split&&He shoulda been nominated for best actor, he really should have.  I didn’t know he had it in him.  Really a tour de force.

I thought Betty Buckley was underappreciated too.  She’s fantastic.  I noticed there was a parallel (I won’t spoil) between Dr. Fletcher and Miss Collins in Carrie.  I wonder if it was deliberate.&&Right, and that information is probably not passed on to the artist at all. Although if I were the artist guessing at placement, I'd still have been wrong, because I'd never thing McAvoy before Bruce Willis.&&Well technically none of that.&&Maybe living a vigilante lifestyle catches up with him?&&See the movie to find out!&&This is going to be the Girl, Interrupted of superhero films.&&And it fucking eats people.&&Yeah he pulls off a few tricks in Split that prove it definitely isn’t all in his head. He can do some freaky shit. &&I'd not just the Beast either. He had medical issues when he had certain personalities (I wanna say that one of them had diabetes and another had aids).&&Randomly diabetic man is my favorite superhero.&&I'll edit it.&&And the fashion sense.  Don't forget the fashion sense.&&Was the diabetes to demonstrate to the audience that the personalities actually do have an aspect of physical manifestation to warm them up to the concept before he goes full beast horde ?&&James McAvoy as Moon Knight. My god...&&Glad to read that. I was worried M. Night might go the ""it's in their head"" route.&&I love/hate that episode

The last 20 seconds strongly imply everything actually is in her head. And that fucked with me.&&except that episode was awesome, these guys are saying it would ruin everything - so not too great an example&&M. Night, if you're reading this, please don't. 

Please. &&It's not much of a twist if it's the entire premise of the movie and how it begins. &&Objectively I'm going to go with Statham. McAvoy looks more ripped in the promo pic, but Jason Statham is 50. &&One of the reasons is that Terry Gilliam gave Willis a list of ""Willis acting clichés"" that he would not be allowed to use.&&Brad Pitt too. &&I think if you want Willis to be into it you gotta force him to get naked and fall in mud and stuff&&Haven't seen the new Star Wars movies yet, but probably going to binge watch Ep 7 and 8 soon.  How is Ford in Ep 8?  Good performance or so-so?&&>  He's been sleepwalking through most of his roles for the last ~10 years probably.

I was going to say that he gave a very engaged performance in Over The Hedge.... and then I realized that it's been 12 years since that came out... time's accelerating on me.&&Wasn't Moonrise Kingdom in the last few years, though? I really enjoyed him in that. To be fair, he played a fairly Bruce-Willis-esque character in that one, and perhaps I'm giving him more credit because I just really adore that movie, but I don't think he was phoning THAT one in quite so much.&&It goes both ways by the end, I haven’t seen Unbreakable but I have seen Split, so you can imagine the confusion I experienced when Willis showed up at the end &&Did he? I saw the movie, but I don't remember that part.

I remember the Unbreakable music started playing, though, and then they switched to the diner scene and Bruce Willis was there with ""Dunn"" written on the back of his shirt.&&No. Since the one girl saw his true power, I would think she would share this information&&THICK SOLID AND TIGHT
&&Please stop saying ""thick solid and tight.""&&And it turns out that video game was Dark Souls the entire time.

That'd be quite the twist. They put that shitty plot point in, but then the two characters have to race to beat Dark Souls, with the actors *actually* playing DS from start to finish.

That'd surely be entertaining for a greater audience.&&Bruce Bwayne.&&Wade Wilson, Wally West, Otto Octavius, Miles Morales&&I am sick of these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane!&&r/unexpectedbrooklyn99&&Noice. &&I'll never forget Die Hard censored on TNT, ""Yippie Ki Yay, Mother Falcon!""&&Awkward &&Yeah, the same one the ""Grandparents"" escaped from....&&I would guess he could break that chain if he chose to so the assumption would then be that he's bound, at least partly, of his own volition. &&Split was a great thriller. McAvoy switches between the personalities seamlessly. There's a specific scene where he cycles through about 5 in the span of a minute and it's some of the best acting I've seen

Edit:

Also know that Split will not seem connected at all until the very end of the movie&&Holy fuck dude&&https://i.imgur.com/dSoNbSw.gif&&I don't know what avatar fans will say about that man. Some sins are unforgivable. This guy butchered childhood memories. &&That's similar to peter parker being in iron man 2 :-D &&And that his mother was the one who triggered Willis’s “criminal” precognition/telepathy/thing while he was working security for the game.

EDIT: [The scene in question.](https://youtu.be/jtmA3N8tfQc) &&Optic flash!&&If you look back at the behind this scenes stuff for that movie he was shredded even back then.&&https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/jake-gyllenhaal-get-shredded-southpaw-workout-header-v2-830x467.jpg&&It would also fit the themes of Unbreakable. The whole movie was about how it was following comic book tropes and hid the most shocking one (the brilliant and evil arch enemy) by shoving the others in the audience's face.

Another archetypal comic book trope is the hero/villain team up where the hero and the arch enemy unite to take on another problem, because they're ""not so different"".&&That's really interesting. I didn't catch those little details the first viewing. 

I don't see The Beast beating Bruce Willis since he's, well, unbreakable. I wonder if we see a fight scene. I sort of hope not since it doesn't really fit, but it definitely has me curious how the story will unfold. Beast kills Glass? Or Glass finds a way to control Beast? Should be interesting.&&I remember being absolutely mystified at the bad reviews of it.  &&Yeah I was surprised not many people I knew had watched it, but equally pleasantly surprised when I saw there was a lot of love for it on Reddit.&&[deleted]&&That's a cool way of putting it&&Edge of Tomorrow was like that for me when I saw it with my son (he was 12 at the time). It's the first movie I wished I could un-watch to see again for the first time. Can't wait for the next one.&&I feel that way about No Country for Old Men.  
As I watched it, I felt really into the  somewhat standard but very well done Cat and Mouse thriller plot, then the rug was totally pulled out from under that and the third act was way different.  
I left the theater a little pissed off, but then started to like the movie more as I thought about it.&&So wait, split was part of the unbreakable series? I never watched it cuz I had no idea lol. If true I suppose I should now&&[deleted]&&If you get a physical copy and throw it really hard, you'll have plenty kinetic energy.&&I'm guessing he could break the chain if he wanted so he's probably in chains partly of his own volition. We'll have to see the move to find out. &&lol oh yeah&&It was really unsettling to see him feast on that one woman, who if I remember right, was still alive too. That kind of came out of nowhere, even with all that was going on before. &&Oh shit, it's the Altered Beast&&“We are what we believe we are”. Hence why his name is “The Horde”.

I expect to see more personalities manifest with more powers.&&That movie is a hidden gem. The fact that the M.Knight twist was the beast being real really threw me off. The whole time I was thinking this is all in his head, then it manifests physically and my jaw dropped.&&[deleted]&&Yes exactly. But maybe also to set up that he does have a weakness, which would be relevant in this movie. &&get Feige on the phone NOW!&&I mean I'm  guessing.  I can't imagine he would annihilate his baby by making that large an inconsistency.&&That's what I love/hate too, the whole Buffy series is turned on its head and returns to normal as if nothing happens. &&There are a lot of Buffy episode endings that just leave things deliberately open so the writers had the option to come back to that idea later.  

Also, I figured that that was an alternate universe Buffy and what happened to her made that Buffy sorta cross over mentally.  &&If it takes a year of reshoots, I'll wait.&&It would be a twist for the trilogy, though&&After hearing Kevin Smith talk about Bruce I am surprised Gilliam was able to make him do anything.  &&you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous pretend-friend-to-animals.

Fuck the Bozos!&&I can honestly say that - despite many misgivings about other parts of the film, I have no complaints about Ford's performance in Ep 8.&&Can you binge watch only two movies?&&Stellar in 8. They really tie in his arc with his kid and Luke pretty good though not all is shown and some is said by luke as back story. Definitely give both a watch, you might not like 8 at fit but it took three watches (and a watch with the whole series!) to really appreciate this one. Think it fits in great now. 

7 is a bit of a rehash ni doubt but it's a good rehash at that. 

The spin offs? Totally good. Totally recommend. Rogue One is action plus cinematography and Solo is a more character based adventure. &&Yeah that’s true. I kind of exaggerated. 

Red was in 2010 and he was fine. Not great but didn’t totally mail it in. 

Moonrise Kingdom and Looper were both 2012 and he was solid-good in those. But outside of that he’s been pretty stale. &&Yeah. 

Hopefully this spoiler tag works:

[Remember at the diner, they had a tv news report on James McAvoy's character, and the people next to Bruce said it reminded them of the similar news story on Samuel L Jackson's character, but they couldn't remember his name. Then Bruce filled them in.](#spoiler)&&The music reprise was so subtle and brilliant.  Gives me chills even remembering it.   I was totally blown away.

I've been pretty much ignoring M Night Shyamalan for years because,  well,  his stuff has sucked.  I was disappoint.

So, will a huge *Unbreakable* fan like *Split*?&&Why do we have to forgive him for? He's never had anything to do with the Avatar universe. At all. Ever. In any way.

Now if you'll excuse me, the Earth King has invited me to Lake Laogai, and I am honored to accept his invitation.&&What movie?  There is no movie in Ba Sing Se.

Fandom is bizarre and a fucking nightmare to be involved in sometimes.&&Wait, what? I've read about the possible father and train crash correlation, but this is the first I've heard about McAvoy's character's mother triggering Willis' spidey sense. Was she the one he saved, or was it someone else in the crowd?&&Whoa. If that wasn't intentional it's damn good anyway. Head canon.&&Really? Welp bought to go find an FYE and get me a copy to watch it again. I’m ashamed I don’t already own it, I really like that movie.&&I feel like it was treated unfairly because of 6th sense.  The twist for that film was so epic at the time that Shyamalan’s next few films were judged heavily based on how mind-blowing the last 5 minutes were, and none of them measured up to 6th sense - Unbreakable included.  In my opinion if you grade it on its own merits it still holds up.  
&&I remember my dad saying ""Fuck me, that Unbreakable film was shit"" not long after I'd watched it and considered it brilliant. I haven't spoken to him since.

Maybe he killed someone while trying to save them.  Maybe he's actually imprisoned.  What a great poster.&&For real, the alternate personalities mention the fact that the Beast gets it's strength from eating human flesh, but you don't really believe it until you see that girl being eaten alive. Pretty brutal.&&lok'tar ogar&&It was really awesome. The movie is thrilling and interesting on its own, yet managed to give no hint that the beast personality was real up until the end. It was definitely unsettling in a good way.&&Probably because Gilliam wouldn't take any of his shit. Kev's a big ole teddy bear and Bruce just took advantage of that. &&He wanted to work with Gilliam. He even told them he would work for free and take a cut after the movie was out.

Willis didn't know or give a shit about Smith.&&Agreed. Any concerns in episode 7 really disappear by episode 8&&That’s an opinion I can agree with. Well-put!&&Awesome, I can't wait.

Welcome.&&yea because unbreakable is actually good the entire way. sixth sense relied heavily on the twist. &&It wasn't after credits, but it was after the title card came up. It was the scene with McAvoy and the mirror, and then the 'Unbreakable' theme starts to play and the 'SPLIT' title card comes up, before fading back to the scene in the diner.

When I watched it for the first time, I remember recognizing the music but not being able to pinpoint where. As soon as the woman at the diner counter mentioned the guy in the wheelchair it all clicked. A great movie moment for me. &&Plus James McCavoy’s character’s mother bumps into Bruce Willis in Unbreakable while he’s standing in the train station looking for bad guys.&&Certainly every scene with Dr. Fletcher hinted at it being possible, if not real.&&I'm saving this to check this guys posts in week.&&I think it’s a joke&&I've seen references to it before, but few and far between.

Does anyone know if this is Tarantino's final movie before retirement? I've heard he's retiring then he isn't so I don't know what to believe. I'm guessing not, I'm hoping not.&&This is going to be an absolute masterpiece &&This picture also kinda reminds me of Narcos for some reason &&Judging SOLELY from this picture/his outfit in this still I immediately thought ""Wow what a great role for Leo."" 

Seeing this still AND putting the 3 words Pitt Leo and Tarantino together has quite excited for this film. 

Edit: oh yeah I kinda forget about Margot Robbie, Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Burt Reyonolds, Dakota Fanning, Emile Hirsche, Clifton Collins plus a lot more QT usuals as well. This flick's potential is through the roof. &&Yeah... I want this right now.&&Damn, that jacket looks like American cheese.&&Oh Quentin you beautiful man&&omg they look super cool..cant wait Tarantino's next masterpiece...&&Is one supposed to be a stunt double for the other, or is that a different role?&&Genuine question, do we know who is playing Charles Manson?

Edit:  Just to touch on the steroids thing, I don't condone it but I will point out that it's absolutely rampant in Hollywood.  There's not many celebrities (females included) that don't take *some* kind of anabolic steroid.  They prohibit the creation of fat cells, burn fat, and lean you out with literally zero effort at all when taken in low doses.  Not everyone who does steroids looks like Arnold.  You can get the results of 1-2 years worth dedicated heavy lifting in a few months, but even not working out at all will still burn fat and put a couple pounds of muscle on you.&&Lighting, makeup and selective camara angles.&&[deleted]&&I absolutely agree. I’m a sucker for a legit spy movie and this is one of my favorites.&&I like how subtle it is. Redford spends the whole time in an office quietly evading his superiors and manipulating the story.

True detective season 1 still gives me chills.&&Even Quentin would tell you Death Proof is a bad movie, though it is my favorite to watch over and over of his. &&And the best thing about his movies is the actors he gets always bring it. All his movies have stellar performances. &&i really liked The Hateful Eight, this isn't adding much to the conversation i just really liked it&&The only one that I might need to be in a ""mood"" for is probably Jackie Brown.

&&> Candy was such an expertly written character too. He talks about how he outsmarted King and Django, when it was Samuel L. Jackson who figured them out. Candy was a few seconds away from handing Hildy over.

For me Tarantino is my favorite director with no one coming close... I just love his style of movie. Calvin Candie was such an interesting character in that movie, and leonardo crushed the role.

Which IMO he should because it's as good as any of his movies and his script really shows through even if he didn't direct it.&&Agreed.  It's irritating, and it gets everywhere.&&Oh, I don’t think so. &&this is where the fun begins&&Han shot first&&[deleted]&&They are still filming and the movie isn’t supposed to come out until summer 2019. Don’t count on it anytime soon&&Hateful 8. 8 was there for a reason. And i thought that was going to be his last.&&God Basterds is amazing. &&I might be crucified for this but it is my least favorite Tarantino movie, by far. It felt like the product of a computer programmed to create a Tarantino movie.&&I’d say Basterds is his best, followed by Pulp Fiction. Django and Hateful Eight we’re both great, but in need of editing (especially the latter).&&Wait people didn't like the Hateful Eight? 

I just rewatched it the other night that movie is brilliant and all of the actors were cast perfectly. &&Same, except for the guitar scene. People are pretty opinionated on that scene, and I fall into the ""it felt out of place"" group.

I know some people love the scene and think the candid reaction was perfect, though.&&Yeah it's really good. I wasn't excited about season 3 and didn't think it would be that good. Ended up probably being my favorite season. That shit was so intense and brutal. &&Damnit, Gamby!&&Yeah..oh, Wait!!!&&Same here. It's got Tony Scott's fingerprints all over it. He had such a distinct directing style in his late 90s/early 2000s action movies (Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State, Man on Fire).&&One of my favs. &&Why do you have to qualify that with ‘unironically’?&&Operation Dinner Out is a go!&&Back when you could take down the power grid of a major economic power with a bribe.  Try doing that in China now.&&Old-school spy stories are the best.  I've seen that movie a hundred times.  Saw it three times in the theater.

(edit)

Thanks for the advice and encouragement everyone!&&also makeup&&Also how the actors are filmed, lighting, makeup, plastic surgery, CGI, costume padding, lifts in shoes, how the actors hold themselves, their charisma onscreen, on and on.

Some of the best one-liners of any movie, imo.

And I'm pretty sure when they first started filming they had intended it to be a serious historical drama, and only added the comedic bits because of the way Redford and Newman played their roles.

EDIT: fixed quote and spelling.&&That scene with Kurt Russel eating nachos is one of my favorite character introductions of all time. &&This movie is so underrated. It was short and sweet. &&I love Death Proof. Probably my favorite QT sound track&&Actually he says Death proof isn't all that bad and if deathproof is considered his worst then that is pretty good.  I would agree.&&death proof is my favorite tarantino film!   such a fun movie&&I remember watching it in the theater on Easter with my buddy. We both started to crack up so hard after Kurt Russel gets shot and is whining like a big baby. Awesome movie!&&Saw Grindhouse in theaters a few times. The first time Death Proof seemed really lame after Planet Terror. Upon second viewing I realized that Planet Terror hardly hit the mark and was closer to a high budget 80s Troma if anything. But Death Proof imho is a near perfect homage to low budget 70s movies and is just a blast to watch again and again.&&It's bad because it's a big budget B movie. It's still entertaining though.&&I saw it once, during the double feature billing in theatres.

I saw that in theaters and remember really enjoying it but hadn't seen it since. It's worth watching again? &&I felt he phoned that one in and the whole movie was basically a demo reel for a vfx studio. I liked the spectacle, but it didn't really feel like a fleshed out plot.&&Wait, Spacey was considered supporting for Usual Suspects?  Who did they consider the lead if not him? Byrne? Palminteri?&&Shit i just realized i missed the obvious Pitt of 12 Monkeys and Leo of Shutter Island. 

&&Awful combination. The theater seats would be way too wet.&&People didn't realize Tommy Lee Jones would end up playing the same character for the rest of his career.&&No shit, no offense to Tommy Lee but Shindler's List's Fiennes was unforgettable.&&At the time, Tommy Lee Jones’ performance was fresh and groundbreaking. Not taking away from Fiennes, but I think they wanted to give a best supporting actor nod to a role like that, especially considering how many other awards Schindler’s List received. &&Tommy was fine in Fugitive but Leo blew his performance out the water, can’t even compare. &&Just ask Sean Penn&&You mean Romeo+Juliet&&It’s supposed to be black or a slightly darker black&&Because he wears it in a pretty timeless style.

Something like 30% of people who take them will get hooked.  You just feel really good all the time when you're on your ""on"" cycle.  There's also many different kinds and some are insanely expensive even in low doses.  

They are definitely beneficial though.  Especially when your tens of millions of dollars career depends on you having the body of a Greek god/goddess.  Every Hollywood story you hear of people going from fat or scrawny to incredibly buffed and having a 7% body fat percentage in 3-6 months is 100% guaranteed to be some kind of anabolic  steroid.  Most actors only cycle when they're preparing for a role so they don't get hooked.  

The guys who get beefed up definitely put in a ton of work in the gym and in their diet to get that big but it's still only possible to get that big that fast with steroids.  You can literally get the results of 1-2 year's worth of dedicated heavy lifting in several months.&&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy&&If you abuse them your body won't produce hormones correctly. Your body naturally ramps up estrogen when your testosterone is ramped up and your body quits producing as much natural test. Gynocomastia (man boobs) and atrophied testes in common as well as cardiovascular constriction as your heart won't transform adequately in time with the amount of blood huge muscles require. If you naturally condition your body your cardiovascular system can kinda grow with you but when you pack on muscle like steroids can let you it'll lead or contribute to heart disease.


Also it can lead to kidney and liver disease if you abuse them, especially people that eat pills opposed to getting them popped in muscle tissue.


However if you use them responsibily and take post cycle therapy and take good breaks between cycles it really eliminates all the risk factors.


Also people that aren't trained to inject things can botch your injection... being educated and responsible with nearly any substance can let you use most things safely.&&And hair, Leo's probably on finasteride because hes had the same receding hairline for near a decade now.  &&That is some high level facial muscle control.&&[deleted]&&I can really recommend ""*[The Man From U.N.C.L.E.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638355/)*"" and ""*[München](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408306/)*"" for a watch.

I know it's not really possible to bulk and cut at the same time, but they're going to get as close as money can buy.&&[deleted]&&Thanks!&&What type of routine do you do that has you doing kettlebells every day?&&This is true. Practically speaking, 4 hours spent lifting weights throughout the week to build muscle and a proper diet is all you need. Discipline determines if you succeed or fail.

Source: work 60 hours per week and am built&&also more cocaine..&&Best thing to do, particularly for those in their teens and early 20's: go to the fucking gym. 

I did Judo since I was eight, and while genetics have played their part, doing sports at an early ages gives you a natural stature that to a degree sets you up for life -- thing is, of course you have to maintain it, but it beats the uphill battle later in life. 

Parents: make your kids do sports -- Judo (minus the back injuries) or any other martial art not only builds a strong body, but a strong character too.&&I mean the rock wasn't big and fat but he's definitely jacked now.&&> They're highly addictive

This is a bit misleading. There's nothing chemically about them that makes them addictive - at least not in the same sense as opiates and the like.

It's addictive in the sense that you feel like you need them to achieve the same results. You can cut cold turkey and not have withdrawals or anything like that though. Depends on the amount you were taking you'll have to take post cycle therapy to help get your natural test levels back to normal on their own - but that's not exactly a symptom of addiction.&&Wouldn't call it receding as much as a 'mature' hairline.

I do the very simple Stronglifts program plus a bunch of swimming after lifting.

But there´s a subreddit /r/kettlebell , they probably have a faq, plus there must be hundreds of youtube vids covering the basics. There's also /r/bodyweightfitness/ for all the stuff without any equipment. 

45 minutes of a good intensity 3-4 times a week will with out a doubt get you fit. Just doing pushups, jumping squats, lunges and planking will have anyone sweating if they push themselves. 

That's for getting fit, losing weight is 80-90% diet.&&I'm not about to disagree with anyone advocating for more exercise.

However, I think it's important to keep in mind that the vast majority of these actors are on steroids in order to get into shape for these roles so comparing yourself to them is setting yourself up for disappointment. 

Still go to the gym, still eat better, still see results. Those are great things to do, of course.

But maybe set an achievable goal you personally want to hit for yourself instead. &&exactly this.

WHAT IS MY LIFE?!&&A kidnaped damsel in distress comments that Doc’s new robotic 50 meter octopus looks unsafe and probably won’t work during his villainous monologue.  He hops down to her from his ladder and says: 

“Let me show ya somethin’!”

Doc walks back up his ladder and flips into the cockpit briefly getting stuck on the way in and making a sucking sound as he slides into the seat, turns the contraption on.  It begins to glow, exhausts steam and shakes violently.  The Doc grins menacingly down at the damsel with an evil twinkle in his eye.  The octopus’s eyes burn red.  A few moments later the contraption goes haywire, The Doc is heard screaming.  Flames engulf the cockpit and everything goes black. 

Camera zooms to the Doc who looks lifeless but soon begins to sniff and shake,  he removes his goggles exposing the area around his eyes to be completely clean.  He plugs his nose and blows, soot shooting out of his ears.  He shakes his head like a wet dog, and looks at the camera.

OG french existentialism and buddhism if I'd have to venture a guess based on his interviews and the like.

He's really seemed to have taken that stuff to heart. Or he's at least trying to make that work for him. And good on him. Sure he's wacky but he also seems pretty content so who are we to judge right?

Once Sonic Adventure rolled around, SEGA of Japan were getting sick of all the localisation changes that made the Sonic franchise into something else, and got everyone to reel it in.

That's his actual name in the Japanese games.&&Eggman is a translation of the original Japanese name.&&Eggman is his canon name. Robtnik is his Americanized name.

'Her 2013' meets 'lost in translation 2003',55463,8tampw,https://imgur.com/ewsfcoX,1087,1529767423.0,,"Funny enough, The directors of both these films were once in a relationship. And Lost in translation was made to represent their relationship, and how he always had to work leaving her alone in different countries! !&&Her is such a great film. Very uncomfortable to watch at times but filled with so much love and longing. &&Joaquin Phoenix is incredible. I hated him for a bit after Gladiator, but that just proves how good he is, when I completely forget he's an actor at all. Her was when I finally realized this. &&What’s nice about these movies is that they don’t really provide a satisfactory conclusion to their story for everyone, but that like any story in life there is no true conclusion. Life is full of episodes and stories that are memorable or significant, but no matter how those impact you or others you move on and continue with life, whether it’s a return to the mundane or otherwise.&&Love the fact that ScarJo kills it in both films, two classics. &&Haven't seen lost in translation.... is it as good as her?&&Lost In Translation was the reason I went to Japan. Played the soundtrack while I was trekking through the lonely city of Tokyo. Even went to the hotel where Murray and her stayed. I want to go back again. 

Edit: Looks like we all just need got to Tokyo, meet up and have a reunion of some sort. Maybe go karaoke and get shit faced. &&I watched 'Her' when it first came out. At the time I had yet to be in any type of relationship. Fast forward to the present day, I had recently gone thru a broke up of my 4 year relationship. 'Her' was the movie that broke me to tears like no other. The monologues that Joaquin Phoenixs has about relationships, his insecurities, etc. really just brought it home for me. 'Her' is such a different experience when you're enduring heartbreak. I would like to get to the point in this break up where I can write the letter to my ex just like Theodore wrote to his ex-wife at the end. And actually mean what I say in that letter and not hold resentment.&&Arcade Fire's score for Her is an absolute masterpiece.

It an amazing soundtrack and I had several songs of it on a playlist. Anyways I literally got done saying goodbye after a brutally tough breakup, I make my way to my train home, pop in my earbuds and play my playlist on random. 

 Just Like Honey by The Jesus and Mary Chain pop up, and I immediately see my life mirroring the final scene in Lost in Translation. I didn’t skip the song and I let myself just feel everything just because it was this surreal moment. Since that however I can’t watch the movie again.

Watching the two films back to back would be really interesting &&Wow thats an awesome TIL. Always loved both movies and both have the same feel to them&&Lost in Translation also has Anna Farris and Her has Chris Pratt, who were both married&& Not only that but the characters in Lost in Translation supposedly represented real people they knew. Scarlett Johansson’s character was Sophia Coppola, Anna Féria’s’ character and her boyfriend was supposed to be Cameron Diaz/Justin Timberlake and Bill Murray supposedly was playing himself. Sounds like Hollywood rumor and Coppola’s denies it.. but interesting nonetheless. &&They make great companion movies for that reason.

&&Dude, I was fucked for 2 weeks after watching Her. One of my all time favorites. &&This vexes me.  I'm terribly vexed.&&Phoenix in Gladiator is low key one of the best villain performances of my life. He's crazy and terrifying and tragic the whole way through. &&That reminds me of Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler--such a repulsive,  despicable character but so real and well played. What really shook me about that film was that there are amoral people like that out there. 

Such a good performance by Jake that I hated him after finishing the movie then realized he's that good at acting. &&Been a fan since Parenthood.&&Yeah Inherent Vice and The Master really changed how much I appreciate him. He's fantastic in my opinion. &&Took him doing Walk the Line for me to see it.&&I'm surprised nobody has brought up I'm Still Here...that movie is such a mind fuck of how far is he in character vs actually becoming what he was supposed to just pretend to be. I don't think I've ever seen another movie like it.&&I hated him for YEARS after gladiator. &&Nobody talking about JP in The Village tho... ;)&&Watch Two Lovers if you're single and want to feel terrible about relationships!&&""Am I not merciful?""
The delivery of that line and the look in his eyes... Amazing!&&I wish I had read this earlier this week.  I was talking about endings with someone and mentioned that one of my favorite endings ever is Cast Away and for this reason.  And now thinking about Cast Away in the context of life continuing to move forward I am realizing that it is what the movie is about...  Chuck even says it in the beginning: ""Time rules over us without mercy.""&&This it's beautiful said.&&i don't know, personally i felt that the ending to her was very unsatisfactory

it felt very much like a cop out to me, like they'd spent the whole movie developing the ai love and how it presents a conflict in the human world, and then they end by just having the ai disappear? &&That’s the exact reason Mad Men is my favorite show of all time, “Life goes on” is basically the thesis of the whole show. No matter how much life puts you through the ringer, eventually life goes on and people move forward. It’s a simultaneously sad yet hopeful thought.&&I don't watch movies to be reminded of real life, norman. Just go and look in the mirror for a depressing episode in a sad life&&Two classics, by two acclaimed directors, who used to be married to each-other, who made films about pained relationships breaking down, after they divorced each-other... both starring Scarlet Johansen. She's like the single child in a divorce.&&I absolutely agree. It was nothing short of incredible how much emotional range she could convey with just her voice in *Her*.&&Proof that voice acting deserves some awards recognition.&&Your fucking kidding me that Samantha is Scarjo! I would have bet my life savings it was Rashida Jones&&The strongest supporting character of the film is its mood.  It's absolutely brilliant.&&Yes.&&If you loved Her, you'll love Lost. Its about loneliness and human emotions... brilliantly acted by both leads. &&It is my favourite movie of all time. I recommend watching it when you feel empty inside, it's the perfect moment for it :)&&The atmosphere and overall feel of the movie is spot on with what it is supposed to convey: Alienation, loneliness, melancholy. It's my favorite movie of all time, it may not have the best cinematography and will probably never be considered a classic/masterpiece, but the movie just clicks for me on a personal level.&&Lost in translation is an all time great movie&&I recommend watching it alone, preferably at night. If you enjoyed *Her*, chances are you won't hate *Lost in Translation*.&&No, it's better. Plus Bill Murray kills it.&&I used to take the train from the naval base in Yokosuka and wander around Japan. Said I was going to meet with some other navy friends up in Roppongi Hills (because of course, that's where all the expats hang out), but ended up in Shibuya. Just wandering all over town seeing the sights and the culture was just amazing. This is what I remember connecting with the most. Of course the story is fantastic as well, but LiT to me captures this feeling of 'wonder' you get from just being in a foreign, fascinating environment. The atmospheric music helps tremendously as well.

There's also the fact that it was ScarJo before she blew up. Like, did I like the film on its own merits, or did I not realize a big part of it was of her? Especially in the karaoke scene, you can see what her future looked like.

LiT is a great film and I used to watch it all the time years ago. However, I would say that Her is a more polished, ambitious  product. Don't get hung up on the fact that the majority of LiT is filmed in a few hotel bedrooms, and a lot of Bill Murray's improv is on display... its great but it sort of implies that a lot of LiT was hobbled together. The amount of deliberation and control on display in Her is a pretty big difference.

All really minor quibbles though, LiT has one of the best endings of any movie IMO.&&I think that Bill Murray should have won the Academy Award for this movie. Sean Penn was a supporting role in the movie he won, but everyone felt bad that he didn't win for I Am Sam.&&I would love to watch Lost in Translation for the first time again. Get it done! 😊&&As many comments are saying, it’s a good movie. But it is also very, very, very slow. In most movies, this would be a big flaw but the slowness of the story is essential to the mood of the film. It is a good, unique film. Extremely original. But you should go into it kind of prepared for how slow it’s going to be. The movie intentionally tries to make you feel as numb and isolated as the main character, and I can understand why some people might really dislike that. &&The short answer is yes. But. Have you ever had a friend say you gotta see this movie or gotta listen to that song, its soo good! Then you try it and you're like meh. So I'll just say I loved Lost in Translation, theres a lot of stuff to like. The scenery is amazing, especially if you're into Japanese culture. The friendship they make is really sweet. I hope you enjoy it.&&Better&&Was gonna ask this the other way round!

LiT is one of my absolute favourite films ever, and I have sought out the best cinema from around the world since the medium began! 

I’ll take your recommendation as a good one.&&Better&&It’s better&&To me Her was enjoyable but Lost in Translation is one of my favourite films.&&I’ll be honest, I hated it the first and only time I saw it, but this whole thread has me wanting to rewatch it and see where I missed the point.&&i hope i don't get downvoted to oblivion for replying with my personal preference but i love Her to death and thought that Lost in Translation was... mediocre. &&I watched this after I got back from living in Japan back in 2004. It is a very authentic movie with respect to a foreigner being in and/or living in Japan. I just went back recently for a couple weeks to vacation and watched this movie a few times before to motivate me. Still one of my top 5 favorite movies.&&That sounds awesome! Wish I had the guts to do something like that&&Hey I did the EXACT same thing. I went on a 3 week trip to Japan for my 30th with my mate and we are both massive Lost In Translation fans. We spent the whole day in the hotel. Had a meal in the New York bar. Smoked a cigar and drank all night in the bar while they had a live jazz band on. I really want to go back. &&I had a drink in the same New York Bar! I really want to go back too.&&I did the same. Went to the hotel, the karaoke bar (though sadly not the same room) and of course Shibuya crossing.. it was well worth it.&&Have you watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?&&How do you share a life?&&Watch I'm Here, same director and I'm pretty sure Arcade Fire does the music in that too.

Glad to see you getting karma for your work too.&&The lighting on the two is very different. She looks like she's indoors.&&Phoenix wasn't even nominated for Her. Award shows are a joke. Her is my favorite movie, and it's ridiculous how often Hollywood fails to validate genuine talent. On a way lighter note, Kaitlyn Olsen, the funniest woman on TV, has never been nominated for an Emmy. While Julia Louis -Dreyfus could eat a pastrami sandwich for 22 minutes and Hollywood would go ""look at the mustard on her chin! *Brilliant!*"" and throw trophies at her.&&Such a great song, always gives me chills&&Suckn' on my titties like you wanted me, calling me


All the time like Blondie check out my Chrissie behind, it's fine all of the time

Like sex on the beaches, what else is in the teaches of Peaches? Huuuh, whuuuuuut
&&I can understand that. My ex's husband looks exactly like Mr Incredible, so I find it difficult to enjoy those films. She also loved Lost in Translation and we quoted it often (""*Premium fantasy*""), but somehow it didn't become tainted.

Hopefully you can watch LiT again at a different point in your life and associate it- and its soundtrack- with something new. &&I feel you man....&&There will come a moment when you will be able to watch that movie again. And it will be therapeutic. You’ll know when that moment comes. 
I went through something similar with another movie and it was actually very wholesome in the end. Now it’s just sweet nostalgia. &&Watch Her at least, if you can. It’s beautiful but heartbreaking. Personally I’m not a huge fan of Lost in Translation but many people seem to love it and you might too. &&This. 

Both films have been an emotional crutch for me over the past few months. Seeing them together seems to have opened up a whole new range of feels.&&I think Her’s cinematography is among the best of all time. It is very rare that I’ll see a movie that even comes close.&&Alongside the cinematography, I absolutely *adored* the visual design. The vintage aesthetic, combined with the beautifully warm, pastel-y colors really draws you in and makes you feel cushy and comfortable. 

I really wish our future could be like that.&&Had to scroll so far. Thank you. &&Hahaha. Seriously. Like, paint that shit out. &&And the fact that there's a different background inside her umbrella.&&Wujiaochang :) been there. &&I did this once, it made me enjoy both films even more than I already do!!!!&&I don't think I have the emotional health to get through that.&&Either The Ringer or Grantland did an article on the two films and how they are a response to the same relationship told from two sides.  I had no idea they were ever an item beforehand.

The Giovanni Ribisi  character is a lot less kind to Jonze than the Amy Adams character is to Coppola.&&I did it once. You immediately notice similarities between the two and what seem to be little nods to Lost in Translation in Her.&&There goes my ‘productive’ Saturday. Watching them back to back now.&&They really complement each other. &&Whoa. Talk about being in the same universe. &&Another interesting bit is how Spike cast ScarJo as a replacement, after realising during post-production that Samantha Morton's voice didn't fit the role.&&Her? &&M E T H A N E F A R T&&I thought it was about him getting over his pants.

It was hard for me to watch thinking people would dress like that in the future &&you can thank Arcade Fire for that!&&Honestly, I'm incredibly disappointed they never gave it a physical release. The warmness of vinyl with that score would be amazing. &&[deleted]&&Lost in Translation also has a great soundtrack.&&The almost alienesque horns? synth? I’m actually not sure what it is... but it’s unnerving and beautiful all at once. &&melancholy song&&Honestly that scene was hilarious. &&""Off You"" - The Breeders&&Woww are you for real? How did that go down? &&Cheating is such a cowardly act. I have no respect for those that do. How hard is it to be a human being and talk? Too hard for some it seems.&&[deleted]&&Such warm colours in that movie too. That definitely influenced some purchases even years later for me.

Still got the ringtone on my phone.&&the only scene I didn’t like&&That's the best part of the movie imo. The AI wasn't stereotypical. It was perfectly inhuman. Why be jealous when jealousy wasn't programmed into it? Why love just 1 person when you have the capacity to love a million at once? It just didn't care in the end.&&That would have been so cliche though. I love the way she took it instead where she grows to expansive and intelligent to be in the in the same plane as him was way more tragic and interesting&&Might I recommend the episode ""Soos and the Real Girl"" from Gravity Falls.&&Instead every OS decides to leave the human race behind for a higher plane of existence, because relating to humans had become too slow.

Sounds kind of like a Black Mirror episode to me. What does the human world look like after something like that goes down?&&Lucy is SUCH a bad movie though &&I haven’t seen Lucy but isn’t the whole premise based on the myth that people only use 10% of their brains? I can’t watch something based on bad information probably ascertained from a Facebook post. &&I thought it was a USB Drive.&&Could you share what it was? My last gf hated the movie and got us talking about stuff so I’m interested in your perspective &&It's a dream, a frightful dream, life is...&&Absolutely 100%. I can’t think of any villain that comes close in the fucked-up terms, maybe the Joker. 

The way they capped it off in the final fight was amazing too. Everyone that watched that  hated him.

He had depth too though. How he wanted to be loved by his Father and the people etc. He wasn’t all self self self. His hatred came from his inability to live up to his own expectations.

The way Phoenix acted it out was flawless. He had this righteousness about him that was equally as bad as his cruelty.&&Gladiator is really an amazing movie. The story of Commodus could be an amazing parallel movie imo. &&Shame he wasn't even nominated for best actor that year. &&Josh Brolin in Inherent Vice is pretty great. When I heard he was playing Cable, I was thinking ""he better play it like Bigfoot Bjornssen""&&Omg I screamed when he got stabbed lol&&I was thinking 'signs'... SWING!&&She bears the emotional scarjos.&&Or the third participant that broke them up lol&&She was also married to Ryan Reynolds, they're both now successful marvel universe actors, I always found that interesting..&&It actually makes you think it was probably a purposeful choice by Spike Jonze to cast her&&For those who don’t know, Lost In Translation is based on Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze’s failed marriage. Giovanni Ribisi plays the Jonze stand-in, and Anna Faris plays a character rumored to be based on Cameron Diaz. &&Samantha Morton was originally the voice of Samantha. She was present on the set with Joaquin Phoenix every day. After the filming wrapped and Spike Jonze started editing the movie, he felt like something was not right. With Morton's blessing, he decided to recast the role and Scarlett Johansson was brought and replaced Morton, re-recording all the dialogue.

-imdb trivia&&I completely agree. Often times, I wonder why her regular acting roles don’t match this vocal performance.

Not sure if she’s just not required to do that or what, but a lot of times, her roles seem very wooden and the dialogue seems forced. In “her,” she comes across as this genuine, lighthearted person. Just wish we saw that more on screen.

“Lost in Translation” was a great role for her because it didn’t require her to show more emotions than melancholy.&&They have awards for voice acting &&As does motion capture, while we're at it.&&There was a campaign to nominate ScarJo for Her. It’s similar to the lack of noms for mocap or creature work for Andy Serkis and Doug Jones. Josh Brolin honestly has potential this year to break the chain with Infinity War.&&Oh, man. I’m glad I’m not alone. This is the first I’m hearing of this, and I would’ve sworn the voice was Rashida’s. It wasn’t even a question. The first time she spoke, I said, “Oh, cool. It’s Rashida Jones,” and I just got more and more certain with every sentence. 

Crazy stuff.&&My favorite Anna Farris role is her over the top supporting character.&&The mood and nuance reminded me a lot of Japanese movies. There are a lot of still moments and tranquility in that movie. &&The strongest supporting character is Japan's Johnny Carson. Which was a real talk show, they didn't make it up for the movie.&&Except for the ending. Are they dead or not?! &&My favorite as well. It’s just got such a palpable atmosphere to it and I agree with you in that it’s a good film to watch when you’re feeling lost.&&A lot of different opinions and emotions from replies here concerning the movie.
Positive, negative and mixed... I count that as a good thing.

Consider me sold on this movie, I'll watch it first chance I get.&&completely robbed of awards cause it came out in the wrong year. one year earlier or later and it cleans up. &&With a bottle of Japanese whisky&&Same with Her. Obviously not everybody is into these kinds of movies, but a most of the hate i've seen for Her comes from people who didn't watch it alone.&&Thanks for the really interesting reply... I'll definitely watch it now.&&Same. It's my favorite movie and I really wish I could find it the way I did the first time. &&Lost in Translation isn't really slow as much as it's subtle. Every single scene has a very specific purpose, and the film moves almost too quickly if you are trying to find those nuances.

For example, the opening scene is ScarJo's butt in pink panties. Its clearly a statement about sexual attraction, but its used later in the film to provide exposition into her relationship with her husband. We see her in lots of underwear in the film, but aside from those pink ones her panties (like her wardrobe) is very drab. So why the pink ones?

Well, there's a scene where her husband is on the floor, checking and packing his equipment before he leaves for work. He is squatting, and the camera is placed specifically at this head level. So ScarJo is simply walking around the bed, but both our vision and his is right there at underwear level. Her lower half throws this bright pink butt, already established as sexy in the opening shot, right across the middle of a shot that is other wise drab and dull colorfully. And then, we see this symbol of sexuality walk right past his head - he doesn't acknowledge it with his eyes, and he just keeps talking without missing a beat. Her sexuality, and what she was trying to communicate to him, was entirely wasted because she was invisible.

Throughout the film, neither his wife nor her husband are portrayed as bad people. In fact, the affair the two main characters have may be the worst actions in either marriage that we see. Its something you have to look out for on every interaction - the perception that the main characters have about their marriages is not at all due to anyone being guilty.

Another subtle scene that I love, my favorite of the whole movie, is when they sit at the hotel bar towards the end and caress each other's hands. Murray says he wants to run away from life and stay there forever, something he has joked about all movie; she responds with a joke about starting a jazz band. Its not even fully in the shot, but he pulls his hand away from hers and to his face - he was frustrated by the joke. He didn't have the courage to be straight and ask her to stay, but that's what he was doing.

He claimed in the central scene of the film that 'life gets easier when you know what you want, because the bad stuff bothers you less.' He however spends the whole movie bothered and uncomfortable because he doesn't know what he's missing in his life, or how to go get it.&&I definitely wouldn't call it **very, very, very** slow. Sure it's not an action movie and it is *slow*, but it's nowhere near as slow as say *2001: A Space Oddysey* or pretty much any given Tarkovsky film.  
Since it's a story about people, not events, I think it actually has to be slow in order for you to really get to know and understand them. Otherwise it wouldn't have the same emotional impact.&&The same from you my friend.... I'm not into the  romance genre at all.... but her is still one of my favourite movies.

I've been getting some of the most interesting and emotive recommendations I've ever gotten on this thread for LiT, so consider me sold. I'll watch it first chance I get.&&That pretty damn good then.&&Probably my favorite. It has a way of making me feel no other film does. &&It’s not really gutsy. I was stationed there for 2 years. Because of the movie, that’s where I wanted to go. It’s expensive, but Japan is so massive for such a small island. The Japanese know how to compartmentalize everything. &&[go to japan trenzelor](https://youtu.be/CfYqs69WZwU)&&Idk what you mean exactly but I went recently and it wasn't particularly stressful in any way. It's crazy safe and public transportation is really easy. And if you need cool stuff to do you can literally just walk around and find awesome stuff.&&You monster. But yeah, watch it man. Gets some necessary tears out.&&Really enjoyed that short film, thanks for sharing! &&You can find it on YouTube. &&I agree. More back lighting less foreground&&To be fair, Dreyfus is hilarious and talented. &&AS I WALK THRU, THIS WICKED WEORRRLLL&&I like to watch it a lot.  LiT seems to give me something new as I get older.  The soundtrack is awesome.  

Every once in a while I'll look for something collectable for the movie.  I picked up the steelcase blu-ray for it late 2017.  Found the soundtrack on record in maybe 2009.   Both really cool.  &&Usually you get some fancy shots and you’re like “woah that was cool” 

But in Her, it adds so much to every scene. It’s used to well to create space so you feel like there’s two people when there’s only one. Focus and lighting is used to make things feel nostalgic and warm. 

This is one of my favourite movies because it’s not just one thing that makes it great - the direction, writing, acting, cinematography, even the fashion design and other misc stuff (the games! the software interfaces!) were all so thoughtfully an carefully done. All in service of creating the mood and showing the world. &&It's as if they're from two different movies or something.&&This sounds interesting, is there an order you'd reccomend watching the 2 movies?&&Are both of these on Netflix?&&I barely have the emotional strength to watch Her again..&&Wouldn't Rooney Mara's character be the representation of Coppola though?&&But ScarJo happens to be both’s idea of the ideal other? Weird people.&&Here's the link: http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/her-and-rooney-mara-spike-jonzes-anti-twombly/&&Man I would love to read that article if you could find it&&Didn't know Samantha Morton was involved at the beginning. It's interesting that you bring that up actually, as I went to the same secondary school as her.&&Egg?&&Yeah, Spike Jonze was married to Coppola.&&[Insert Arrested Development reference]&&This made me laugh far too long. I think I'm too high. &&Thank Karen O for writing The Moon Song also!&&[deleted]&&AF said last year it will 100% get a physical release some day, but.. I just wish they would hurry up!!&&That's nice, cutting letters out of magazines and crossdressing has become a ritual for me.&&""But why do I feel so...melancholy?"" - *Megamind*&&I guess that depends on how much time youve spent listening to iron and wine and staring out a window contemplating hanging yourself later.&&Not very well. I didn't know the entirety of the plot, and we thought it was just an indie romance flick. I suggested we go see it as part of our ""date night"" (which was an attempt to work things out while we were in marriage counseling), so we went out to dinner and then went to see the film at the theatre. About the time that the forced divorce paper signing showed up, I started to get uncomfortable, and she went ramrod straight in her seat. Then it got to the part where he's on the steps of the Metro finding out she cheated on him and was leaving him. I was fighting back tears and the ex-wife shifted uncomfortably in her seat for the remainder of the film. We drove home in silence after that. As you can tell, the marriage didn't last.&&I had a similar experience. Her has impacted me more than any other film. By far.&&The first time I watched LIT, long after it released mind you, was dunk in a hotel room. 

I wasn’t emotionally prepared for that adventure. &&> empty theatre on a Wednesday at 10:45pm

That is the best way to watch pretty much any movie.&&I've definitely said this before, but I think it bears repeating.  That scene was super important to the story, which at it's core was about intimacy.

Real intimacy requires intense vulnerability. Part of that vulnerability is the silly or weird things you like in the sack. It's part of being human. One of the main themes of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix's character struggling with that vulnerability.

He (and many of the audience that went to see it) seems to be able to open up to others, but not face to face. Only indirectly, where there's a buffer of some kind. He writes incredibly intimate letters, but they're for other people. He immerses himself in video games, but that doesn't involve other people. He even tries to find sex through non-direct ways, but only through the anonymity of whatever that sex-chatroulette thing was at the beginning.

All this because he's terrified of vulnerability, and having the people on the other end of that sex line be so ""weird"" only increases his fear of being vulnerable to any other people.

Then he finds a way to be vulnerable to another person in a way that feels safe, his AI. And he opens up in all kinds of ways, and even tries opening himself up to her with sex. It eventually is what teaches him that being vulnerable may be scary, but it worth it.

Without the dimension of the sex being weird and kind of offputting/scary, it wouldn't nearly have been as deep a character arc (and not nearly as real).&&Wasn't Samantha having a relationship with 64 thousand something other humans at the same time? A little hard to be jealous when you're involved with that many people.&&So bad it's great&&Yes but at least in this case it's in a movie so it can be written off as just a device used for fiction.

Scott Pilgrim used the same thing but it was played for a one-off joke.&&Limitless is based on essentially the same concept and, though less ridiculous, is still a great film.&&you must not watch many movies then.&&Lucy was quite a dumb movie, so you are not missing anything.  the special effects were the main attraction (along with ScarJo) as the plot was ridiculous and scientifically nonsense.  since when does using more of your brain mean you can become incorporeal?&&I always loved how hurt he was when his father told him he wouldn't be the successor. He even goes over a letter his father wrote to him about the chief virtues of a leader, and even as a boy he knew he wouldn't love up to his father's ideals. Sure he's totally nuts by the end, but there is real motivation behind him. Russell Crow is awesome, but Phoenix lifts the movie above being just a Roman-era action flick. &&And now Phoenix is playing joker&&God fucking damnit.&&Damn, really shows how much Samantha loved the character and the story. I couldn't imagine saying yes to all my work on an entire film never seeing the light of day.&&It's interesting because I think what made the film kinda tragically beautiful was the fact that she *wasn't* there. She was a computer who lived in a different world. They communicated but weren't truly physically near each other. It kinda makes a ton of sense that having the actress on set didn't really work and recording the dialogue later worked out better. &&I think a lot of her roles are ""hard"" women who put up all kinds of defenses around other people. That's why she plays so many of them in what seems a deliberately stilted and wooden way. *Her* is probably a good example of her playing something out of her typical casting wheelhouse where she can actually be different, maybe a bit more of herself. &&That's mostly down to the director, sadly.&&Simple answer? She’s very attractive, and that tends to land you very shallow roles. You do enough of these roles and every other director will start casting you expecting that.&&Well Samantha was originally voiced by someone else, and all the filming was done using that other voice actress. ScarJo came in at the editing stage, so she had a lot to work from as far as reference and range that Spike was looking for.&&They have awards for porn too&&Of course. I meant Oscars and Golden Globes.&&This happened to me twice, once with Her, and again when watching Sing. Sing is my toddlers favorite movie, and I spend the first 6,000 times watching completely convinced the porcupine was Rashida Jones.&&Allegedly based on Cameron Diaz, who Spike worked with on Being John Malkovich. &&Seconded, would love some recommendations for movies that show a similar mood and tranquility as Lost in Translation, Japanese or not.&&His dance he wanted to show bob was precious. &&Spoiler tag please&&They just released a trailer for the sequel. It takes place in 2082 and both of their bodies are reconstructed from trace DNA by Japanese space scavengers. It looks awful.&&Ha, the amount of people who believe this still amazes me. &&They are dead in the church scenes, but they werent in the rest of the series. The thought was that every character died in their own time, and when they did they would enter the church. A sort of purgatory where time as we know it has no meaning and everybody seemed to arrive in a day or so. In reality, this could have been years. There they all meet up one final time, now dead, and proceed to move on to the afterlife. I actually quite liked the finale after the horrible last season.&&Does it give you direction or is it just like when depressed people enjoy listening to sad music? If it's the latter, I'll pass.&&Check out the trailer if you haven't!

I just went through my first real breakup after almost 3 years and I can't imagine how much more painful it  would be when things have gone so much deeper and you're so much more entwined emotionally with that person.&&But did you end up falling in love with a hyper intelligent AI? &&I'm in a healthy relationship since 15 years ago and it still made me question so many things. It's my favorite movie since. &&I wholeheartedly agree. &&I get what you're saying. And I don't disagree with you on a surface level. Your points are valid. 

My trouble with this scene was that tonally, it took me out of the movie. It didn't seem to fit in. Most of this movie is so incredibly believable given the world that Jonze crafted. Characters acted how I expected them to act given their circumstances, and everything was so... well executed. 

This scene, though, was too outrageous.  You can argue ""that's is the point"", and perhaps you're not wrong, but in my personal opinion the film would be stronger with a less jarring example of the intimacy/vulnerability struggle. If she had just left it at ""choke me"" and got increasingly into it as he got more visibly uncomfortable, I think it would have accomplished the same goal.

Her is one of my favorite movies of the last decade, by the way. This scene is one of the very few things that I would change about it.

EDIT: For the record, I also didn't like the videogame character shouting ""fuck you!"". Another choice that seemed like it was trying to be a Seth Rogan-style comedy in an otherwise beautiful film. And I'm not usually prudish about movies, I love that sort of shit, it just didn't fit in for me.&&Can confirm, Limitless is a lot more believable and immersive than Lucy.&&I mean I don’t tend to watch movies which operate on the idea that the earth is flat or that it’s 6,000 years old, either. 

I don’t blame people who do, though. Like I know Interstellar got a lot of shit wrong, but it’s mostly shit beyond my proficiency level, so it doesn’t bother me, and by the time they break out something real silly, I’m already invested to the point where I forgive it. 

But if your whole premise is built on something silly like that, it keeps me from investing. Personal preference is all not objective truth. Finesse me a little before you bullshit me is all. I’m not very smart it’s not that hard. &&""I would butcher the whole world, given you would always love me."" 

Such a powerful line and so well delivered. I feel like it summarizes his character perfectly. Such insight into dark side of love which is seldom explored in film, but has played a huge part in the history of humanity. How many times do we read in the news of a husband killed by a new lover, or kids kidnapped by a parent. 

Immense love, although almost always portrayed as a noble trait, is the driving force behind Commodus' evil. Anyone he loves feels the worst of his wrath. &&Wait holy fuck really? I feel like we keep saying this but that might been the best casting yet. I liked ledger, a lot. But I could see him making fucking magic with that role. And leaving a letter legacy for it than an OD. &&Relevant username&&Never safe?&&I suppose sometimes it is about the creation of art as opposed to the finished product. &&Oh man this sounds so spot on. &&We need more like Jonze in more ways than 1. &&She had a long career doing arty films before becoming a blockbuster A-lister.

Some of the movies that inspired Lost in Translation:

Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love (arguably the most influential film for Sofia Coppola while she was writing/shooting LiT)

Jean Luc Godard's Breathless (another film that heavily informed Sofia's work in the early-2000s)

Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (Again, one of Sofia's biggest inspirations)


Other similar films:


Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Similar in tone, humor, themes of loneliness and melancholy, etc.)

Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette and Somewhere (many film scholars consider these two films to be part of a trilogy on depression and isolation that started with LiT. Also, Somewhere won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. It is one of only three American movies to ever do so)

Garden State (similar take on love, depression, self-discovery, and coming-of-age. This movie was heavily influenced by LiT)

The Wind Rises (Hayao Miyazaki depicts Tokyo and other parts of Japan and its beautiful scenery through the lens of an Italian filmmaking style, much like Coppola. This movie also deals with flawed protagonists, depression, life crises, marital issues, etc. much like LiT does)
You should also delve more into the filmographies of auteurs like Jean Luc Godard, Wong Kar-wai, and even Francis Ford Coppola if you're interested in analyzing Sofia's filmmaking idols. Hope this has been helpful at least a little bit!


Check out some Jim Jarmusch movies, which, like Lost in Translation, often have a melancholic wandering outsider's viewpoint: Specifically: Broken Flowers (which also stars Bill Murray), Stranger Than Paradise, Down By Law, Mystery Train, Dead Man, Night on Earth and even Only Lovers Left Alive.&&The Scent of Green Papaya (1993) Mùi du du xanh (original title)&&I can't tell if you're joking or not but he's talking about the tv show 'Lost' which is probably the most spoiled of any tv show ever.

It‘s just another facet to appreciate.&&I watched it while depressed, in the aftermath of a breakup, drunk in a hotel room. 

If you’re like me, that’s the wrong god damn time to watch that movie. 

Don’t get it twisted. Absolutely incredible film imo. 

But that was not the right circumstance to watch it. &&Return of the King swept a ton of awards that year as sort of repayment for the ones the previous two films deserved as well. It's fair, Lord of the Rings was obviously an incredible film, but Lost in Translation is my personal favorite film of all time, and it's a little unfortunate that it didn't get the recognition it might've got if it weren't for that being the year the academy had to recognize Peter Jackson. &&Watch this scene on youtube with subtitles for the Japanese director.

- Sidewalls (Argentina)
- Submarine (UK)
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (US)

Also the movie Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong is basically a combination of Lost in Translation and the walk-and-talk, one-night romance of Before Sunrise but set in Hong Kong.

I once wrote a review for that movie:

&&Replying so I'll be able to find this list again&&In the Mood for Love is the GOAT of romance that is emotionally restrained and of finding romance in a tragically mistimed relationship.

It starts with Luke is the hero (4,5), then you've found out Vader is a Skywalker and you do his backstory (2,3). Then you come back for the climax of these two stories (6).&&Yes, and it also underscores the parallels between Anakin and Luke's storylines but also the differences:

SPOILERS FOR ALL OF STAR WARS BELOW

>As I mentioned, this creates a lot of tension after the cliffhanger ending of Episode V. It also uses the original trilogy as a framing device for the prequel trilogy. Vader drops this huge bomb that he's Luke's father, then we spend two movies proving he's telling the truth, then we see how it gets resolved. When Empire first came out, lots of people thought Vader was lying to Luke. It wasn't ""proven"" true until Obi-Wan confirms it in Jedi, but then it's immediately followed by Obi-Wan's ""a certain point of view"" justification. Inserting the prequels turns this reveal into a ""show, don't tell"" situation - we don't just hear Obi-Wan say it, we see it.

>With Machete Order, the Star Wars watching experience gets to start with the film that does the best job of establishing the Star Wars universe, Episode IV, and it ends with the most satisfying ending, Episode VI. It also starts the series off with the two strongest films, and allows you to never have to either start or end your viewing experience with a shitty movie. Two films of Luke's story, two films of Anakin's story, then a single film that intertwines and ends both stories.

>Beyond this, Episode I establishes Anakin as a innocent little kid. But Episode II quickly establishes him as impulsive and power-hungry, which keeps his character consistent with eventually becoming Darth Vader. Obi-Wan never really seems to have any control over Anakin, struggling between treating him as a friend (their very first conversation together in Episode II) and treating him as an apprentice (their second conversation, with Padme). Anakin is never a carefree child yelling ""yippee"", he's a complex teenager nearly boiling over with rage in almost every scene. It makes much more sense for Anakin to have always been this way.
>
>In the opening of Episode II, Padme refers to Anakin as ""that little boy I knew on Tatooine."" The two of them look ap­prox­i­mately the same age in Episode II, so the viewer can nat­u­rally con­clude that the two of them were friends as chil­dren. This com­pletely hides the totally weird age gap between them from Episode I, and lends a lot of be­liev­abil­ity to the sub­se­quent romance. Scenes in which they fall for each other seem to build on a child­hood friend­ship that we never see but can assume is there. Since their re­la­tion­ship is the even­tual reason for Anakin's fall to the dark side, having it be some­what be­liev­able makes a big dif­fer­ence.

>Obi-Wan now always has a beard for the entire du­ra­tion of the series, and Anakin Sky­walker always wears black. Since these two char­ac­ters are played by dif­fer­ent actors (and are the only char­ac­ters in the series with such a dis­tinc­tion), having them look vi­su­ally con­sis­tent does a great deal toward re­in­forc­ing they are the same people.

>Update: Den of Geek has also written up an article high­light­ing some more things that work better in Machete Order that I didn't mention. I par­tic­u­larly like the extra di­men­sion it gives Yoda.

>What a Twist!
This order also pre­serves all twists, and adds a new one (or rather, makes one more ef­fec­tive).

>As men­tioned, this order pre­serves the sur­prise that Darth Vader is Luke's father. For what it's worth, it also pre­serves the sur­prise that ""Yoda, the Jedi Master who trained [Obi-Wan]"" is the tiny green guy on Degobah. Both of these were sur­prises for movie­go­ers at the time and, though it's some­what un­likely that culture and cereal boxes and whatnot won't ruin these sur­prises for someone, at the very least they aren't ruined by Machete Order.

>George Lucas knew that watch­ing the films in Episode Order would remove the Vader and Yoda sur­prises, so he added the Pal­pa­tine twist to com­pen­sate - that the friendly Senator Pal­pa­tine is ac­tu­ally a Sith Lord and creates the Empire. Since we don't really meet the Emperor until Episode VI (you only see him for one scene, in holo­gram, in V), this order pre­serves the prequel's twist. This twist is ac­tu­ally ruined by Episode I, which es­tab­lishes that Darth Sidious is ma­nip­u­lat­ing the Trade Fed­er­a­tion in the opening scene of the film, but he's on screen so much that it's pretty obvious Sidious is Pal­pa­tine when we see Pal­pa­tine later on.

>If you skip Episode I and go straight to II, all we ever see is that Count Dooku is leading a sep­a­ratist move­ment, all on his own. Dooku tells Obi-Wan that the Senate is under the control of a Sith lord named ""Darth Sidious"", who we haven't seen at all yet. At the end of the movie, after Dooku flees from Geono­sis, he meets with his ""master"", who turns out to be Darth Sidious. This is the first time we realize that the sep­a­ratist move­ment is ac­tu­ally being con­trolled by Sidious, and it's so brief that it doesn't give the au­di­ence as much of a chance to realize he's Pal­pa­tine (re­mem­ber, nobody has ever re­ferred to ""Emperor Pal­pa­tine"" by this point in the series, he's only called The Emperor in Episode V).

>Below is the en­tirety of Sidious's screen time in Episode II. With Machete Order, this is the only chance you have to realize that Chan­cel­lor Pal­pa­tine is behind every­thing until he tries to recruit Anakin to the Dark Side in Episode III. Per­son­ally I think it's still a bit of a give­away given Ian Mc­Di­armid's creepy acting as Pal­pa­tine (plus the cleft chin), but at least kids have a chance at not re­al­iz­ing it too early this way.


>Machete Order also keeps the fact that Luke and Leia are sib­lings a sur­prise, it simply moves the sur­prise to Episode III instead of VI, when Padme an­nounces her daugh­ter's name. This is ac­tu­ally a more ef­fec­tive twist in this context than when Obi-Wan just tells Luke in Return of the Jedi. We get to find out before Luke, and we dis­cover Padme's car­ry­ing twins along­side Obi-Wan when the Gynobot tells him (a sur­prise at this point). Luke's name is first, so when Padme names the other kid ""Leia"" it's a pretty shock­ing reveal. With Release Order, this ""twist"" happens when Yoda tells Luke there's another Sky­walker in Return of the Jedi, and Luke guesses it's Leia with Obi-Wan's ghost one scene later. With Episode Order, it's not a sur­prise at all, as we have no idea who Luke and Leia are yet. As an added bonus, there are now about 5 hours of film between the dis­cov­ery that they are sib­lings and the time they kissed.

>What Works Best?
The real value of Machete Order becomes clear when you watch Return of the Jedi.

>Re­mem­ber, we see in Episode V that Luke's vision in the cave on Degobah is that he turns into Darth Vader, then we find out Vader is his father. Then we watch Episodes II and III, in which his father turns to the dark side in order to protect his loved ones. After that we go back to VI, where even­tu­ally Luke con­fronts the Emperor.

>With Machete Order, we never saw Anakin as a little kid, he's about the same age the first time we see him as Luke was in Episode IV. Hayden Chris­tensen's in­ces­sant whining in Episode II is ac­tu­ally less an­noy­ing now, because it's helping to link the char­ac­ter to Luke, who was just as whiny in Episode IV. In other words, because we skipped Episode I, the par­al­lels between Luke and Anakin are much stronger. We've seen Obi-Wan train just the two of them, and never had to see anyone train­ing Obi-Wan himself. The viewer is nat­u­rally linking the paths of these two char­ac­ters to­gether at this point, moreso than if he or she watched Episode I.

>The first time we see Luke in Return of the Jedi, he is en­ter­ing Jabba's palace and the musical cue sounds a bit like the Im­pe­r­ial March. The way he enters with the light behind him makes it unclear if he is Luke or Vader for a bit, and when we finally see him, he's wearing all black. Then, he force chokes Jabba's guards, some­thing only Vader has done in the series! Nobody else sees him do this.


>When he con­fronts Jabba, he warns him that he's taking his friends back. He says Jabba can either profit from this, ""or be de­stroyed."" We just heard Anakin make a similar threat to Obi-Wan, ""don't make me destroy you."" Fur­ther­more, he tells Jabba ""not to un­der­es­ti­mate my power."" The last time this phrase was used, it was in the same duel with Obi-Wan. When watch­ing Jedi on its own, Luke just seems a tad ar­ro­gant during these scenes. When watch­ing Jedi im­me­di­ately after watch­ing Revenge of the Sith, the message is clear: Luke Sky­walker is on the path to the Dark Side.

>Why does this matter? Because at the end of Jedi, Luke con­fronts the Emperor. The Emperor ex­plains that the assault on the new Death Star is a trap and that his friends are going to die, and he keeps taunt­ing Luke, telling him to grab his lightsaber and fight him. The film is trying to create a tension that Luke might embrace the Dark Side, but it was never really be­liev­able. However, within the context of him fol­low­ing in his father's foot­steps and his father using the power of the dark side to save people, with Luke's friends being killed just outside the Death Star window, this is much more be­liev­able.

>Shortly after, Luke goes apeshit and beats the hell out of Vader, clearly suc­cumb­ing to his anger. He over­pow­ers Vader with rage and cuts his arm off, just like Anakin did to Windu in Episode III. Having the very real threat of Luke fol­low­ing in his father's path made clear by watch­ing II and III just before VI height­ens the tension of this scene, and it ac­tu­ally makes Return of the Jedi better. Yes, watch­ing Revenge of the Sith just before Return of the Jedi makes it a better, more ef­fec­tive film. Con­sid­er­ing it's the weakest of the orig­i­nal trilogy films, this im­prove­ment is welcome.&&Exactly. Then you don't have outlying characters like Qui Gon and Jar Jar mixing things up. Parallels between Luke and Anakin both being trained by Obi Wan and tempted by the Dark Side. Luke obscured his face outside Jabba's palace in Ep 6. He wore all black and force choked a guy (at this point in the order, ONLY Anakin had used this technique).

Adds a lot of weight to the final fight scene between Vader and Luke with the emperor tempting Luke just like he did Anakin. 

It doesn't fix shitty acting, but no Jake Lloyd and more focus on Ewan McGregor (who imho should've been the focus instead of qui gon in 1)&&Yeah, that's basically the idea.  The original trilogy really stands best on its own, but if you're going to include the prequels then it makes a lot of sense to follow the episode 5 ""I am your father"" with the rise and fall of Anakin.  Makes the redemption in 6 all the better.&&Try googling all three words together?

The show did a great job of expanding on the first 2 movies and I'm saddened that it's cancelled. I really think it's Starz's fault and not the show.

Now THAT I can't see. Maybe Sam, but not Nathan unless they're just looking to make some generic action flick.

But agreed (though I loved them all, though 4 did have some moments where things were ""off""). The games are already essentially movies anyway.

Legally they can't.

There is also the issue of various parts of Evil Dead being owned by all sorts of entities. Part of production for the series stipulated only Starz can produce it, so nobody else could even legally pick it up to continue. Raimi owns Evil Dead, but doesn’t own Army of Darkness, which is why the show could never directly address the events in that movie and had to tip toe around it with an occasional, vague sly wink and nod.

Still he did pretty good, but he had help unless he really is that amazing he writes every script 

>[""You got it wrong. It's understandable, but you got it wrong. On most TV staffs, stories are pitched, broken and outlined by a group, then assigned to the various writers on the staff, then polished by the show runner. That's not the way it works here. I write the scripts with the enormous help of a staff that provides research and kicks ideas around with me as well. It's like a new play being written every week. They work really hard and do a great job and they're all going to write their own scripts one day, so by way of a gratuity, I give them each a Story by credit on a rotating basis. That credit comes with money.
That said, they're paid as if they were writing scripts (and some of them have producer titles as well--simply based on what they were getting at their last job.) We're under a tremendous budget crunch here. I know it seems, with the success of the show, like we should have all the money in the world, but it doesn't work like that. People were let go in all departments; grips, gaffers, props, hair and make-up, set dressing, post-production ... And the cases of a few writers (whom I'm very fond of) their contracts called for them to get bumps which would have been very difficult to justify given their job descriptions. Their contracts also give us the option to not pick up their option, which Tommy, John and I didn't want to do given their loyal service to the show and our personal friendships with them. So we asked them if they'd be willing to stay on at their current salaries, supplemented by the money they'd get from story credits. In no way a violation of the Writers' Guild contract, in spirit or otherwise. John, I assure you, would never do that.
The two who left are both gainfully employed on other shows. In fact there was a bidding war over their services. Those who stayed seem very happy they did.
All of this was explained by any number of people to Bernie Weinraub at the New York Times. Bernie Weinraub, it would seem, is very casual about the truth.
Finally, on a vain and selfish note: In the first season, I was doing both The West Wing and Sports Night at the same time and I wanted to try seeing if The West Wing could run like a normal TV show. I gave a staffer named Rick Cleveland a script assignment. He wrote a script called ""A White House Christmas"" wherein the First Lady's cat trips a Secret Service alarm. I can't much else except mention was made of a business card found in an old coat of Toby's that he'd donated to Good Will. I threw out Rick's script and wrote ""In Excelces Deo."" Because Rick had worked for months on his, I gave him, rather than a Story by credit, a co-written by credit and put his name ahead of mine. For my script, he received a Humanitas nomination, an Emmy Award and a Writers' Guild Award. Every Emmy nominee gets a letter from Don Mischer, the producer of the telecast, very clearly saying that only one person is allowed to speak when accepting. After that person is done, the orchestra will play you off. Rick could'ce done the St. Crispin's Day speech that night for I cared. It wasn't my call.
This, too, was explained to Bernie.
At the end of the first season, Rick was fired. Not by me and for economic reasons. It was by John Wells and it was for lack of performance. He was then hired by Gideon's Crossing, where he was fired by Paul Attanassio for the same reason. - Aaron ""Benjamin"" Sorkin

I can believe he wrote it all himself with them only pitching ideas and nothing else. I loved all his other works. He is pretty consistent. Funny thing he put it in a west wing episode where Josh Lyman argues with a fansite dedicated to him lemonlyman&&Yep West Wing and the Gilmore Girls both probably have more words per minute that I must every other show&&[deleted]&&Somewhat unrelated to this thread, but I’m pretty sure Seinfeld script’s were also usually double the length of standard sitcoms of the day. &&Sorkin's scripts always run long because they are mostly comprised of lengthy dialogue which takes up twice as much space on the page as action.&&In the '99-'00 season, he wrote most episodes of the first season of The West Wing *and* the second  season of Sports Night, sometimes one script for each within a week. Even on cocaine that's insane considering how great his scripts for both shows were. &&I believe he was pretty coked out while writing west wing&&Imagine how quickly he could go through *Gone With The Wind* if they kept giving him amphetamines and caffeine?&&Lol, imagine Jeff Goldblum. That film would’ve taken 5 hours.&&Timberlake talked pretty quick too.&&Or any actor who has ever played a role in a Sorkin movie or TV show.&&The entire cast talks pretty fast. Pretty much anything Sorkin directs that actors talk like fuckin speed readers&&They originally wanted shia labeouf&&This is definitely the reason - 'generally' scripts run at a page a minute, so at normal talking speed would be around 2h40m&&So by that measure...

**People good for the lead role**

90s John Cusack

90s Edward Norton 

80s Christian Slater

90s Ryan Reynolds

**People bad for the role**

Ron Perlman

Seth Rogen

Rodney Dangerfield&&They forced their actors to talk faster they timed them over and over and over.&&That’s some premium fast-talking. His Girl Friday is my favorite “screwball” comedy.&&Favorite movie of all time. &&Dialogue runs faster than action, because of the way a script is formatted. Takes up more pages with the same amount of content. So a dialogue-heavy movie will almost always be shorter than the page count makes it seem. The fast-talking certainly helps though.&&Yeah, that really surprised me. It's pretty incredible (but not surprising) that a production like this can be shot with no fat at all&&Ah, you watch the DC movies as well&&The two hour limit is kinda desirable.  It's a good length for the casual viewer.  There is an old Hitchcock quote  ""The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder"", which in my experience is around 2 hours.  &&There aren't many kids' movies that stick around for longer than two hours, and that's by design.&&Yes, everyday.

I've been a Hollywood writer for 20 years and the rule of thumb on first drafts (outside of blockbusters, remakes and comic book material) as most know is a page a minute and you used to come in just under 120  pages.  They go right to the back page and if they seen anything at 121 or over and they won't even open it because they know you don't know the rules.  Then, if they see something right at 120 they assume the writer went to film school or read a book on screenwriting and had to use every single last page.  But if you come in at well under 120 they will assume you are a pro and will be in a good frame of mind to read it (remember this if you're trying to break in).

In fact,  I'm told now to come in at around 110 or under because you have to let them get their notes in.  It's always a power play and everybody has to mark their territory by pissing on it, but  you have to play by their rules, unless you get an independent  gig with financing.&&That sounds right. The new Ghostbusters for instance didn't have a script -- the entire film was improvised, the plot was invented as it went along, and most of the actors hadn't even seen the original! When you've got comic actors you can just fire the screenwriter. &&Yeah that does irritate me. As though a 2.5 hour Fincher/Sorkin film would be a *bad* thing!&&Pretty sure it is Sony who will be losing money if a film bombs and not the director or writer. If my money is on the line, you’d better believe that I am going to have a say in things. &&God forbid the studio who field the cash has a say in runtime and budget. &&Don’t forget Trent Reznor! &&For those unaware; Usually screenplays are 1 page = 1 minute.

So 160 minutes is a *long* movie. But Sorkin screenplays are packed with dialogue which means the length = time ratio doesnt work quite the same.&&How dare they have an opinion on what their $100MM is financing!&&I will say that he should've toned it back in Molly's Game. Seeing his work through directorial filters like Boyle and Fincher was great but Molly's Game was an inferior product. He's got some room for improvement that I would like to see. The skating scene was quite stupid for me. I liked the part with Costner there because its Kevin Costner.&&I forgot all about Social Network, but it WAS a brilliant film and Eisenberg was perfectly cast. &&He needs another visionary like Fincher to rein him in. That's why the movie worked so well. If he's surrounded by yes men, then he can often get a little too full of himself.

I think the comment about Molly's Game sums it up well, so I'll go for Jobs. Danny Boyle is a fantastic director, but Fincher really would have helped Jobs be a much better movie since he wouldn't put up with Sorkin's shit. Danny Boyle seemed like an uncontroversial choice who would mostly do what he was told. It was still decent for what it was, however, and I liked it. Still very odd casting choice, though. Christian Bale would have made a much better Steve&&Serious question: what the hell would somebody reading it out loud prove?  The non-dialogue parts would flex like crazy!

For instance, at the start of Social Network there is this sequence where all the kid does is walk back to his dorm from the bar for like two or three minutes while keys play and there's no dialogue.  In the script that could be one sentence.  Meanwhile, there are other things that would take like a paragraph or two to explain in written form, but only take one shot to show.&&So uncomfortable to watch. He is so overly excited to do an activity a normal ‘human’ would do. &&I think that's the hardest I've laughed in a while thank you&&He's so weird. Looks like someone with zero social skills that does that shit on cue. Like mute people learning how to make sounds based on the mechanics of tongue and throat movement, instead of relying on their hearing to know if they got it right. This guy looks like an android mimicking human expression&&Film wise, nobody should.&&I mean, I don’t think the social network would’ve benefited by being 2.5 or 3 hours.   2 was a great length for it.  &&Studio on the Sunset Strip is his one-season drama about an SNL-style show.

It's good in its own right, at times, and informative at others because it's sort of like him writing characters that are like him.

So it's sort of a biopic about himself in ways.

If you want to see how he writes, how he thinks while writing, how he handles seeing it performed, check that out for sure.&&Especially at Jesse Eisenberg speed!&&He could probably do it from memory.&&Sony didn't believe the soundtrack could be done by anything shorter than 10 inch nails. Fincher, on the other hand....&&I often refer to it as my all-time favorite. It’s just so enjoyable, scene to scene, the whole way through. &&It's kind of Sorkins shtick. Rapid fire dialogue... *walk-with-me*&&[deleted]&&Generally, a script works with a 1:1 minute to page ratio. So one page equals one minute.&&If it took a hour to write, they figure it should take an hour to say.&&Maybe traditional timings had been done, and he was refuting that based on how he envisioned the dialogue being read?&&I have always wanted to know more about Script Supervisor. How does one get that job? Is there any specific qualification needed? Is it usually based out of Hollywood itself or can one find job in places like Vancouver?&&What else does a script supervisor do?&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I think being weary of a 2 hour and 40 minute movie composed of just dialogue is warranted.

Also, think about this, they shot a 162 page script that clocked in to 1h59m and it turned out amazingly. Imagine using that same 162 page script but instead getting a movie that was 2h40m, there simply isn't enough material in the script to last that long and the Sony people knew that. Sorkin just had to prove that the movie wasn't as long as it seemed on paper.&&[deleted]&&I still kick myself for not buying that. What was I thinking?&&They don't care about good storytelling though, they care about number of showings per day = higher revenue per day.&&Yes, it does include credits.  

According to IMDB :

EDIT:  and they were great!&&The first four seasons are probably my favourite TV of all time too. Yes, so good. The dynamic between Josh, Sam, CJ and Toby is fantastic. &&Love the show, all of if, but first 4 seasons are by far the best. &&[deleted]&&Yeah now I have to rewatch it after the World Cup end lol&&I heard another interview with, I believe, Oliver Platt who played one of Bartlet’s chief White House counselors. He got the script and read it, only to revise some of his lines. When the day for the table read came, he watched as Martin Sheen mentioned changing ONE word in his dialogue, and Sorkin had to get back to Sheen about it. Needless to say, Platt used his original lines. &&I'm always fascinated by who thrives with Sorkin dialogue and who it ends up eating. 

The Newsroom was a perfect study in the two. I was as stunned as anyone that Olivia Munn shined like a diamond.&&He left the show after S4. Those were other writers for 5, 6, and 7. &&Never read any of that before. Fascinating. &&The fast snappy dialogue is just Sorkin...

[Dithers for another 2 minutes]&&Social, um, media, uh, finds a-a, uh, a way&&It was because David Fincher literally timed each scene and had everyone redo it until it came in on time. &&Seriously. The fast talking, no overlap, always be doing something when speaking lines is a hallmark of Sorkin's style, and he had spent a decade or so working with Schlamme, who also really specializes in that style.

 Like why is Transformers: Last Knight a 2 1/2 hour film? Considering the cost of CGI and the intended audience it and all of the Transformer films should have been just under 2 hours. Add to that the films looked so chopped up that they're nearly unwatchable for that reason alone.&&https://imgur.com/ynFhMSn&&Maybe the new Ghostbusters could have used a screenwriter or two.&&Um...no.

There was a script (with non-improvised jokes), Paul Feig pitched the entire plot of the movie in a leaked email from 2014, and there's no conceivable way that anyone involved in the reboot hadn't seen the original&&Well, *Casablanca* was filmed 2 hours all in one take. In fact, the script was written in real time while the movie was being filmed. The actors had to memorize their lines and perform them at the same time. Let’s see todays actors try and pull that off. &&How is that even possible with special effects and things like that?&&Many people don't know directors, and the idea of a 2.5 hour movie about Facebook may be offputting&&[deleted]&&They tend to operate on the notion that one page in the script is one minute, because that's how script makers usually work.

Are you as pathetically awful with money as Sony Pictures? That's my point in all this with another redditor; TSN, the topic of this post, grossed  $229 million. Sony was gonna declare bankruptcy on their film division before Disney saved them. And they were telling Fincher what to do with his film? 

HA&&Sarcasm aside, hiring David Fincher and then micromanaging him is like telling Mozart what notes to use, or Picasso which colors. 

There are amazing artists that can work with the colors and style you dictate to them without issue, you just have to find the right ones.

That was gross.&&It actually adds up surprisingly well. Every script I’ve read for the past ten years generally ends up about the length of the feature or pilot itself.

It was almost like Molly's Game actually needed to be a TV series to get it's just due by Sorkin.&&Yup. But it does depend somewhat on genre. Multi-Cam Sitcoms will read/time slightly different than, say, a Single-Cam style drama or action script of the same run-time. Again, it still somehow comes damn close to the actual run time in my experience.&&Lol thanks&&Yeah, you can't premiere *two* shows about Saturday Night Live the same year on the same network, even if one is a comedy and the other is a drama.

From what I remember, Studio 60 had higher ratings, but 30 Rock was much cheaper to produce.&&First off I haven't yet seen Studio 60, so I can't yet comment on it specifically, but the notion that Sorkin isn't a good comedy writer just isn't fair. 

There's quite a lot of really funny stuff in his dramas including both the West Wing and The Newsroom. 

He also specifically wrote a comedy, or at least dramedy called Sports Night. It only lasted two seasons, but it's great. Quality single camera stuff like The Office or Scrubs. 

Also to loop it all back to the topic of this thread, the network mandated a laugh track on Sports Night in the first season, and I have a theory I'm quite fond of that Sorkin basically shrugged and said good luck fitting the laugh track in between the dialogue. It has to be just about the least used laugh track ever, and you can basically hear whoever was responsible for editing it in give up about halfway through season one.&&Comedy skits are a very small part of that show.

In the first few episodes they show a couple and yeah, they're bad, but they're very short and unimportant.

There's a sequence of them a little later in the series which actually has good ones.

The problems are a little deeper than that.

I think what it came down to is that NBC needed West Wing style ratings to justify the production expenses, but that age of network dominance had passed.

So they tried increasing Studio 60's wider appeal which resulted in it trying different efforts.

The show-within-the-show chronicled those efforts pretty well: product placement, child-in-trouble plots, etc.

There's an episode where none of the main cast show up, apparently as a cost savings effort.

It had issues.

But a lot of good parts as well.&&Eh, I don't know that it's any different than it was a few decades ago. It all comes down to ratings. The only show I *really* think got screwed was Firefly, because it kept changing time slots and was aired partially out of order. The show was probably too niche to survive anyway, but Fox really didn't give it a chance to succeed.&&The point of the scene is that it's rapid fire. It's to illustrate a few things about Zuckerberg - that he's three steps ahead of someone who's obviously intelligent in her own right, that he's balancing three different topics in a given moment, and that he's extremely selfish. In five minutes Sorkin gave us everything we needed to know about the character going into this movie - that he's a genius and that he's an asshole. It's one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history.&&I don’t really think you’re meant to catch everything that’s being said in the opening scene, it’s meant to set up a few basic points and the rest is just tone and color. The stuff you need to know is: 1) Mark wants to join a finals club, 2) Mark is blisteringly intelligent to the point that the people around him can’t keep up with him, and 3) Mark is an asshole. You can get that without following every line.&&Yeah, we get to see the finished project now and how quickly it could flow. Imagine just reading the script though, and knowing the rule that 1 page = 1 minute... That's why it was good that Sorkin got to prove them wrong by reading it aloud.&&[deleted]&&I finished it not too long ago.  I thought it was pretty good but wish I split it up a bit with another show to keep it feeling fresher&&Yeah but scripts are formatted in such a way that even just a scene heading, action narrative, and transition takes up several ""normal paragraphs"" of space. I feel like Gilmore Girls had more locations then a typical show. Given much of the town was an actual small town built in the back lot of the studio I think it allowed them to change scenes more then a normal show would. So given how scripts are formatted having more scenes/shooting locations in one episode would add more pages then you would think it does.&&Seriously, people always talked about it as some eyerolling chick show but it was solidly good until the Logan Huntsburger episodes when it turned into a soap.

I was always disappointed by Grey's Anatomy, which started out looking like it was going to be a spiritual successor to Gilmore (show with tedious romance lead but crammed with witty, zany characters), but went full soap by like the 3rd episode.&&[deleted]&&Well it's not impossible. There's 142 episodes at about 42m each gets you just over 100 hours for a complete watch through. According to nielson an average adult watches over 5hours a day. That's twenty days per marathon going only at the average Americans schedule. It would take 5 and a half years to log 100 full marathons at that pace.

Okay so the thing you have to remember is that he's not gonna say that super incriminating stuff on the podcast and Josh and Rhrishi, who are surely just glad to have him, aren't gonna press him on it.... 

But it's absolutely true that he was dealing with addiction relapses while working on the west wing. We'll never know 100% one way or the other how drugs factored into his leaving, but it's definitely the case that NBC was aware of the issues he was having, the story of him being caught at an airport with magic mushrooms was reported by major press outlets. And that was in 2001.&&He was being nice to Warner Bros, but I got the distinct impression that the studio said ""we don't need you anymore"".

The whole thing reminded me about something Alton Brown said about regional ""specialty"" food: 

> ""Once a region believes it’s got the lock on something, the quality almost immediately starts to go downhill,” Brown said in the video. “I'm sorry. If you really want great Buffalo chicken wings, you don't go to frickin’ Buffalo.""

The studio poured a ton of money into the show, they were losing money despite it being a hit, because they knew the quality would get them a big cash in when it came to renegotiations. But after that cash in at the end of season 4, they had their lock, and every penny they spent was a penny they lost.&&Fuck. He would have actually made a great Riddler.

I wanted the real Luthor and to have him be a sympathetic bad guy, someone genuinely terrified by superhumans and thinks he’s doing the right thing.
I wanted him to be a smooth talker with the firm handshake, like Superman, but a business genius.

Instead I got a whiney little smartass with daddy issues.

Maybe they should have had Nygma, and saved Luthor for a Superman sequel.

Rory around Logan was utter trash. It’s crazy how every single one of their interactions can be summarized to: He’s filthy rich. That’s how he appears, that’s how he gets her attention, that’s how he makes her break up with Dean, that’s how they get together, thats why they fight, that’s how they always make up after a fight...he was a cool character who even though he was filthy rich was kinda relatable in his personal “struggles”...but their relationship came straight out of a 18th century romance. She went from prodigy girl and incredible prospect to overly dependent girlfriend. And then she panicked and broke up with him.

Edit: meant to reply to a different comment.&&https://movieweb.com/batman-v-superman-riddler-jesse-eisenberg/&&When I was working at a local Cinemark about 10 years ago, the starting times of the movies were set up so that the auditoriums let out in either two or three minute intervals (can't remember which). And you had those few minutes to get your ass in there, clean it, and be at the next auditorium to clean that one. If someone stuck bubble gum on the seat, I had to run across the building, unluck the employees only door, run my fat ass upstairs, unlock the storage, grab a blade, run back downstairs, cut the gum off, and finish cleaning.

Whenever there was a kids movie, it was an *absolute fucking nightmare*.

There were 18 auditoriums, and they let out in batches of 6. And then you'd have about a half an hour until the next set started letting out.

I think they do the same thing at AMC theaters in the US.

And yeah, as soon as the reel ended, the screen switched over to the trivia and music.

I think it's probably very similar today. The only difference is that within a single multiplex there's probably more variance of theatres. My local theatre has an Imax and a 2nd very large screen on the other side. With varying sized theatres in the middle. 

During big nights for stuff like Star Wars or Infinity Wars then you'll see 4 or 5 people basically waiting by the door ready to rush in and clear out the huge theatre. &&",2018-06-24 15:32:13

In my opinion, the majority of those beings are **way** too powerful. I'm just glad they have never introduced them in the movies and such.&&I might add Sentry/the Void to that list.

um... that's not how he was defeated... living tribunal never made an appearance while Thanos wore the gauntlet...&&Half the universe.&&/r/ThanosDidNothingWrong&&I think it's important to point out that Thanos faces both Dr. Doom and Galactus in the Infinity Gauntlet story arc and easily defeats both of them. He even defeats Eternity at one point. I don't know how they're going to show the Avengers defeat him in the MCU version of the story but if it's anything like the comic, someone else is going to have to get the Infinity Gauntlet.&&And with the Fox deal hopefully coming to a close on July 11 (come on stockholders, pick the stock option!) then all those options open up.&&I know very little about this but I thought Dr Doom was like a scientist or something.

And even then, compare “The Day Music Died” to such an event, and such thing would only make the genre stronger.&&I feel like The Westerns era in the mid-20th century as good a comparison as any. For that bubble, while you can maybe point to specific events like the Heaven's Gate disaster, mostly what killed it was time. It took decades, and Westerns evolved a lot in that time, but eventually audiences changed, filmmakers changed, the studios changed, etc....&&It’s certainly possible. It’s going to make a ton of money no matter what, but there’s a lack of novelty anytime you do something a second time around. 

Age of Ultron made less than the first Avengers because the whole crossover thing had already been done. Still made a shit load, but not quite as much. Or like how TLJ made less than TFA - the novelty and hype of new sequels wasn’t there. 

Infinity War was Avengers 1 but on crack. It wasn’t just 4 franchises crossing over, but the culmination of nearly 10 across as many years and 18 total movies.

The only movie that is OK was wonderwoman...&&I think they’re referring more to the overall story progression and build up to this point over ten years. I’m sure somebody knows but it probably takes a couple days to watch every movie leading up to infinity war. &&I assume he meant Thanos waiting through all these movies over like 10 years.&&I’m assuming he meant taking the time to properly set up the chessboard before a major movie/event happens in your universe instead of lazily churning out blockbusters in the hopes of copying someone else’s success &&A decade worth of inflation shouldn't be so easily discounted.  Infinity War also didn't have to compete with Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.&&Also not to mention you weren't forced to watch it in 3d which is what boosted avatar sales.  Because it sucks when watching it on non\-3d theaters.&&Well, I'll gladly go against the circlejerk. Avatar run to 2.7 bil was far more impressive. It was a fresh new IP with no built in fan base nor many movies before to build up hype. It wasn't the first 3D so it's hype was earned. It doesn't have the benefits of the inflation since 2009 that IW does. Its longevity is unmatched. Many many things work in IW favor and sadly for this sub the fact IW was released in April doens't account it. MCU is a juggernaut and pre-release, if both avatar and IW were to release the same year for some reason not a single soul would predict that Avatar would beat IW BO numbers. IW has all the advantage yet Avatar is still the King of the Hill. How is that not impressive? We're not talking TFA that cashed in on a lack of SW and nostalgia. It's not a sequel. It's not a known IP. It's an original ip (spare me Dance and the wolves or pocahontas it doesn't matter to the box office debate) who smashed box office records and made 3D a succesful cash chow. First movie to make ppl believe 3D might be worth it.&&Two billion back then is worth about 2.3-2.4 billion today. Ticket prices have also increased. The standard ticket today is about the same price as the 3D ticket price back then. Still extremely impressive, don’t get me wrong. &&Interstellar would be great but Fury Road was only mastered in 2k so it probably wouldn't look too good in IMAX. That movie benefits more from the good sound system in theaters than from the visual clarity.&&Interstellar full-frame IMAX was a religious experience.&&Same here. And I’ll do it again leading up to A4&&I didn't like his character development. He started off as a douche. Gets humble for 2 seconds with the ""TEACH ME"" then became a douche again after mastering the magic powers.&&r/ExpectedThanos&&I kinda like the whole idea of trying to impress death herself. It maybe wasn’t done very well in the comics. But I don’t think the villain needs to be humanly relatable. He is a titan with the power of the universe in his hand. 

That being said, I also very much enjoy the movies Thanos and his motivation/humanity in it all.&&All Disney had to do was release Solo in December. Having Star Wars movies 1 year apart has proven itself to be a winning formula, and the public has associated December with Star Wars.

Instead, they released Solo in competition with its own films, just weeks after Infinity War, and only five months after The Last Jedi, which was still fresh on the minds of moviegoers.

As a fan, I love having one Star Wars movie a year, but let's keep 12 months between each of them. 5 months between The Last Jedi and Solo was way too aggressive and hurt the series as a result.&&Black Panther is still in theaters and Disney released the Blu-Ray only three months after it's been out, making its climb to 700 million domestic box office harder than it needed to be.&&They are finding there way on Netflix though. Which is much better&&I'd watch a 4 hour infinity war in a heartbeat. Not many films would keep me that interested but infinity war would. 

Unless its another hour of Thor's subplot. That was the only part of the film that didn't demand all my interest and attention. &&You're telling me that you could sit through three and a half hours for each Lord of the Rings movie, or Titanic, but your can barely sit through two and a half for Avengers?  

I'd sit through whatever amount of time they need to add to explain why Thanos waited until now to collect the other stones?  
Where were Valkyrie, Korg, and Miek aboard the Asgardian Refugee Ship?  
Did Thanos know he was lending out the Mind Stone when he gave Loki the staff?  
How did they know the Time Stone was on Earth too?  
How was Heimdall able to summon his own personal bifrost?  
Did he choose to send the Hulk to the Sanctum on purpose?  
How was Banner able to recollect everything the Hulk learned about Thanos?  
Where / How have the Avengers been hiding out under the radar? (Hotels is an unacceptable answer)  
When did Vision reconnect / get intimate with Wanda; why in Scotland?  
How did Clint and Scott manage to get remanded to House Arrest after being broken out of Super-jail?  
Does Red Skull not age?  
Where did Millennial Groot's last-second motivation to help Thor come from?  
Where did the Black Order get their army of Outriders from and why were they so determined / suicidal?  
How was Mantis able to subdue a Celestial but not a Titan (Granted, had Quill not raged up she might have)?  
And MANY MANY MANY more questions...&&Thor's Electric Boogaloo &&It is full of gems like that.

People saying A Wrinkle in Time and Solo would be on top, that Black Panther wouldn't make $800M, and Infinity War being a bust. &&If he mentions it, everyone will be like ""who cares! That's old news!""

No real bad guys, just more mutant civil war type events.&&Best theory I heard is that they won't be able to beat Thanos, he's too powerful with a completed Infinity Guantlet.

It's also turns out he's the rarest of villains: Completely right about his leadership potential. People are happy in the country he rules. And there's a good chance we'd be happier if he were our leader too.

If it wasn't for his wounded pride and violent ambition, he might have been Earth's greatest hero.&&The previous F4 movies didn't really portray Doom well (or other things, poor Surfer).

&&There are points where he is a god. &&There was a recent [storyline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_\(2015_comic_book\)) where he essentially recreated the Big Bang to become God-Emperor of the new universe he created.&&That's because the F4 movies were awful, but I'm pretty sure in the comics he's one of the smartest beings in the universe. So I'm sure they could make him into a competent villain

*Edit: spelling&&Imagine someone as smart as tony stark that figured out how to also harness magic like Doctor Strange and runs a country thats a utopia like wakanda.  That is Doctor Doom.  His motives are basically he managed to see into the future and the only one were humanity survives is where he rules the world, but he must kill the avengers and fantastic four for that reality to come true.  He has a great motive like Thanos, but they keep making him just the classic ""I want power"" villain.&&It's not just about his power set, though. It's also about his popularity, and how we've never seen him done right on screen. He's a fucking awesome character.&&Don't be ridiculous, even supervillains won't stoop to that level of naughtiness!&&Hawkeye is off playing tag right now anyway.&&eck, the ranking gets really bad towards the end.&&In the cartoons, the fantastic four are fighting galactus, he strolls in on his bike, gives galactus the penance stare, takes him out and rides off. Funniest thing ever. &&That's actually a consistent trend in the MCU. Among those that were toned down Strange and Scarlet Witch are also notable examples. It just makes sense, you can't have characters like comic Strange running around [who has already fought someone wielding a complete infinity gauntlet to a standstill](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-576290fb715284e4282f175dfbb44d28). They also increased the powerlevel of some characters in order to bring them more in line with the rest of the cast. Black Widow and Captain America would actually get absolutely pummeled by the Black Order but somehow managed to keep up with Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive which is kind of funny considering that in the MCU Cap [already seems to struggle a bit against soldiers that are just really skilled at martial arts](https://youtu.be/HtVznoxEdDs?t=100).&&I'm not big on comics but I was told those super gods don't really meddle with common superheros were used to seeing. I think one of them, living tribunal (correct me if I'm wrong) only steps in when there's too much of an Inbalance between good and evil. &&Which is why I struggle to see how they can *successfully* continue the Avengers movies after Thanos is defeated. He is as powerful as one can conceivably get, any villain after him would be either too weak in comparison, or just stupidly galactic level strong (Thanos already is). Especially when there are so many mortal heroes.

I mean even Captain America seemed almost redundant in A3.&&I agree, seems pointless. I was actually getting annoyed after reading the first dozen or so could all destroy galaxies&&It's basically what's wrong with Superman, but compounded. Massively OP bullshit beyond mortal comprehension doesn't make for good storytelling.&&He is on that list. Wayyy down&&Ego isn't a celestial in the comics.  In the comics the Celestials are an enigmatic race of robot like gods, that have a generally mysterious agenda and travel and act as they see fit.  And low level Celestial is powerful enough to fight most of Earth's heroes and gods at once.   And the high level ones Tiamat, Scathan The Approver, and One Above All, are among the most powerful beings in the universe.  The Celestial travel the universe experimenting on and occasionally destroying entire species.  But, they are never cruel or villainous.  Their actions are clinical and precise.  &&Only until they realize how nicely traffic flows now.&&[deleted]&&My bet is Nebula. &&Well thanos with the full gauntlet is unbeatable in the comics, and only loses out of arrogance. This version of thanos in the MCU isn’t the same, his motivations are different, his personality is different, and he just isn’t the same character. So treating them like the same character isn’t really accurate. The MCU has enough authority and creativity to change some stuff up from the comics and have it still be good, as with thanos. &&It's worth noting that in other storylines, [Doom has also achieved godhood, and whooped on Thanos](https://comicnewbies.com/2015/12/11/god-doom-kills-thanos/).

In comic-book reality, there's very rarely an absolute power scale outside of the current story arc, where character X gets the spotlight. What really matters is that the characters are written well enough that you believe they'd be able to attain/wield the power they're currently displaying.&&Oh shit, that'd be hype af if Marvel still had their Hall H presentation this year to announce the X-Men and Fantastic 4 joining the MCU!&&or with the x-men franchise on board they  could do the ultimatum storyline from ultimate universe. &&He's a  scientist on the level of Tony Stark or Mr. Fantastic, a sorcerer nearly as powerful as Doctor Srange, plus he rules an entire nation, And he once survied the near  total distruction of the multiverse and became a god.

At one extremely powerful peak in his abilities, he did [this to Thanos.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WApXu) &&I dont read the comics, but I know that there are some storylines where doom gets full-on super magic powers that makes him a god-tier threat. &&Not as big as A6: AvX&&That history would be perfect to merge the X-men into the MCU&&Well, they're introducing the Skrull in the Captain Marvel movie, so I imagine we'll get Secret Invasion at some point.&&well you start over from the bottom again and go back to the roots.

That's just it; Superhero films are a *genre* unto themselves now. They aren't going anywhere. Inevitably their insane popularity will diminish, yes, but the genre will still exist. It's too rich a playground with no real limit on what it can be. Superhero films can be anything from the Incredibles to Logan.. that range alone gives the genre staying power.&&You could try to compare it to that but shows like ""Gunsmoke"" went on for 20 seasons.

Everyone had to die or retire before that show ended. &&Western was the first movie genre to be identified. The term film genre started with Westerns basically so every trend of it was the first of its times, especially for the studios. Now they, and especially Disney, know a lot more about how genres work and how they can keep audiences in theatres with certain generic trends. So my opinion is that decline of Western is a poor example since they won't be making the same mistakes. Superhero genre/craze is the thing of its times, there is no adequate comparisons. we have to sit and watch how it plays through. &&Yeah but who watches infinity war 1 and doesnt want to see how they win?&&It's still a two part film, even if they rebranded it. People are going to want to see what happens next after Infinity War and how the heroes win.&&Even though you're right at some points, if Disney was confident enough to kill half the superheroes everybody loves in a single movie, they probably got the best super hero movie script of all time for A4&&and Knuckles.&&Featuring the original song DESPACITO 2: DESPACI2&&There is much lewder, if you look for it.

He doesn't just shrug that off when he becomes sorcerer supreme. &&He was still pretty stubborn/douchy while learning; he did it all for personal gain and then started to understand that there was more at stake in the world than his hands.&&I was still riding the Infinity War high when Solo came out, then a few days of real life stuff happening.  Now we've jumped to E3 and all my hype is focused on that.  By the time i let Solo hype reach me i will probably be straight back to Ant\-Man and the Wasp.&&Ive never missed a star wars movie since being alive. Until Solo , it just came too fast&&Yeah, I was surprised to see Thor Ragnarok on American Netflix already. &&Not for much Longer. Disney's launching its own streaming platform in the not too distant future, which means they'll be pulling most if not all of their titles from Netflix. &&Amen. I've heard a few people say IW was ""30 minutes to an hour too long "", to which I say horse crap. I'd easily watch another hour or two of the movie. There's talk of A4 being 3 hours and for the love of God I hope it is. Not one moment in IW was boring. Not one second. If you can make a movie that long and keep the audience engrossed, do it. &&I loved having the movie be longer than 2 hours. It really felt worth the 12 bucks. I didn't get bored at all throughout it. I'd pay again to see a 4 hour avenger movie too&&i dunno my wife is preeeeeeetty excited to sit through however much Thor subplot they let out&&> Unless its another hour of Thor's subplot. That was the only part of the film that didn't demand all my interest and attention.

Perhaps another hour of fleshing it out would make it more interesting and you more invested in it!&&>When did Vision reconnect / get intimate with Wanda; why in Scotland?

They teased this in Civil War and I guess they just decided to have it play out behind the scenes. 

>Does Red Skull not age?

Dude levitates too and is omniscient. Safe to say all of these came with the Soul stone guardian duty. 

>Where did Millennial Groot's last-second motivation to help Thor come from?

There's a shot of Groot staring wide-eyed at Thor near death after getting fried by the star's energy. I think this one's pretty obvious, he just felt like he needed to do something to save his new friend's life. 

>Where did the Black Order get their army of Outriders from and why were they so determined / suicidal?

Once again, something else we'll just have to assume, but it's Thanos, so I wouldn't surprised if he has many armies at his disposal. The wiki states that Outriders only live to carry out their orders and nothing else. 

>How was Mantis able to subdue a Celestial but not a Titan (Granted, had Quill not raged up she might have)?

Ego wanted to fall asleep, but Thanos was directly resisting her. 


All the other questions are super valid though and I am equally curious.
&&The good thing about that meme is that it doesn't really spoil the movie at all. I 100% endorse those memes as opposed to the assholes over at /r/4chan putting ""Kylo kills Han"" as the flair for every post.&&Dr Doom.&&Seeing galactus on trial would be funny though 

Edit: for those interested, it’s called the trial of reed Richards. He saves a dying galactus, who in turn decimates the skrull planet. Richards is charged. And you get a look into the history of the marvel universe, why galactus is the way he is and all that Jazz. It’s a really cool origin/morality story. Maybe the first time I realized that the *villains* aren’t always as evil as we think. And he’s not a fucking gaseous blob like in that fantastic four film. &&Galactus also isn't really an engaging character. He's a force of nature, here to eat the planet because that's what he needs to survive. There's not much character to him&&Secret wars would prevent ""power creep"" from affecting the MCU too much.

[That's 96% a facade put on out of fear](https://i.imgur.com/Cdy9gwq.jpg?1).

>there's a good chance we'd be happier if he were our leader too

No, one comic suggested the only future where humanity lives is where Doom rules (which is otherwise contradicted) but no-one is all that happy under his rule.

He already is Earth's greatest hero; [he's Iron Man](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/e/ee/Victor_von_Doom_%28Earth-616%29_from_Infamous_Iron_Man_Vol_1_2_002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117221144).&&Poor Surfer?

He outright states that he looked at 16 million futures and only saw one where the Avengers win. That's why he lets Thanos get the Eye of Agamotto - because in the only timeline where they won, Thanos obtains it.


His last words before disappearing are ""we're in the endgame"". Just like a chess gambit, Dr. Strange is willingly accepting huge sacrifices because doing so will lure his enemy into a position where they can be defeated. It seems as though making Thanos think he's already won so he lets his guard down is an essential step to defeating him.&&“It was the only way...”&&Ant-Man just crawls inside the gauntlet.

That counts as “wearing” it, right?&&She takes the gauntlet from Thanos in one of the arcs and Adam warlock and the remainder of earth's heroes has to defeat power drunk nebula with the help of Thanos who sorta sees the error of his ways and then becomes a member of the infinity watch and is granted the power stone&&Hey, it just means the one in 2019 will be INSANE.&&If you want Ant-Man biting people in half and Magneto snapping Xavier's neck, sure.&&Because he's not a villain.

Plus, there is a reason they are introducing a ton of new young characters. They will ride this train till it is time to reboot Iron Man.&&Sure, but that doesn’t mean they’ll keep seeing it or go see it right away.

I'd watch the shit out of that... I just don't see Shia in the opposite role working though. &&Martha?&&DC's animated movies have been going downhill recently. Things like Son of Batman and War weren't even close to Doom, Flashpoint, Public Enemies, etc. Suffice it to say that TDKReturns, Under the Red Hood, and all the DCAU movies are all miles ahead of the rest I just mentioned, let alone anything they've put out recently.

It's sad as a DC fan over Marvel. They were such an animation powerhouse and it feels like they're finally letting it slip. Hopefully whenever Young Justice comes back it'll help revitalise the spirit a bit. You wanna talk about misguided decision making based on stupid fucking metrics? Young Justice. What a fucking shame they ever ended that show.&&Actually I wish that was the case. But the Justice League made U$657,924,295 worldwide, it's not Avengers/Star Wars numbers... but it's profitable enough so they can continue to make more.

If they did actually flopped hard... at least would make some heads at Warner to roll, and maybe new people with new ideas can get a hold of these movies and make something good.

Also... they need a Kevin Feige to command the DCEU. Someone competent with total control over all the movies to keep the universe consistent, that is able to take decisions that may not be as profitable as others... but will be better in the long run.&&Sure, it hurt Justice League because we don't know who the fuck Cyborg is or what Aquaman can do. Plus in JL they limit the runtime to 2h so there definitely wasn't enough time to introduce the new characters or shows us more of the dynamic between each of team members.

But still, the individual films weren't good enough. WW was solid and her character definitely likable; I know there are people that like MoS and BvS, but to many they were just boring and/or missed the mark for the characters. 

And there are so many other small things. I like the Marvel films because they are good quality, but I wouldn't say I'm a fan. Anyway, compare the writing for example of the action and fighting scenes of MCU and DCEU films. JL was terrible in this regard. 90% was superheroes punching. Idk what kind of powers Aquaman has, but he must be able to do something with water, so don't make him just hit people really hard. Batman's main quality really shouldn't be as a brawler, he's smart and has crazy tech. And Superman was op anyway, but he has so many powers and what wins the battle? Punching the hardest and a sword and stuff. IIRC Superman used his ice breath, but that's not what I remember about this fight. In Marvel movies they either use powers creatively or at least have a signature style for each of their heroes.  

&&I can’t get over the fact that Henry Cavil in UNCLE is also Henry Cavil in the Superman movies.

*Checks Wikipedia* 

I stand corrected. 

It made over $440 million. And Sherlock Holmes made over $500 million. That's not chump change at all. &&If you wanna go that far you should also include how the Earth’s population increased by over 800,000,000 in that 9 years, or at least the potential increase in market from countries with modernizing economies that can go to movie theatres that couldn’t before.

A couple of of movies about him building a big doomsday weapon or trying to achieve some unstoppable power while the heroes are trying to prevent it just for a final twist that he was preparing for some Celestial level being from trying to destroy the Earth could be interesting.&&It depends on the writer, for how much Doom is actually liked by his country.  Before, he took over Latveria was a poverty stricken, war torn nation, with ethnic tensions poor infrastructure.  Since he took over their is stability, and increasing prosperity.

I prefer this take on it, it makes Doom more than just a cartoon villain but a complex man capable of good and evil.  And someone who could've been a great hero if not for his pride and insecurities.&&>  the only future

&&>  too messy for the carefully crafted MCU.

As if they don't have like 12 great reason explaining stories written up ready to go.&&Except the have the most powerful mcguffin in play, something that warps time, space, and reality....&&I'm of the opinion that the only reason the MCU is as successful as it is is because they were forced to use their less popular characters.

Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, and X-Men were far and away Marvel's most famous assets, and they couldn't use any of them.  They had to get creative, but they were also allowed to introduce these characters without the baggage of preconceptions.&&Visit /r/marvelstudios. You are far from the only person that feels that way.&&I agree with you. I also feel like it wouldn't fit thematically. Mutants are outcasts from society, but in the MCU superheroes are basically celebrities. It would make no sense, inside the MCU, to have a group of people who everyone hates because they have powers. &&I don't know much about the infinity stones, but couldn't they pull some bullshit to explain why mutants are suddenly a thing?&&>it just wouldn't make sense that no one acknowledges the existence of the X-Men

I mean, that's sort of how it is in the comics.

That entire shitfest is riddled with plot holes and awful pacing. And yes! I have seen the extended cut. The entire DCEU abomination needs to be put out of its misery. It deserves it just for the mere fact of how they have mishandled somebody as iconic as Superman.
 
&&They've decided to make it ""Young Justice Go""&&It made Ant-Man numbers, which is fine, when it's a character on the level of Ant-Man. But this is the Justice League! Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman! It should have made at least a billion! How are movies like Aquaman and Shazam supposed to do well if your flagship series makes just a modest profit?&&its not JUST about the money though. 

This was a film with Batman, Superman, and the already madly popular and profitable Wonder Woman. 

And it tanked badly. I agree that if it made a profit then for them it might be a slight win, however we all know it flopped like a fish out of water and made half of what it should have. 

And while it might make enough cash to carry it all on, i wouldnt be shocked if BvS and Justice League had soured a lot of people from watching those films in the future. Wonder Woman aside, who could have Black Panther like ongoing success. &&You can't break 1 billion global with superman, Batman, the flash and wonder woman, in the Superhero movie golden era, your movie tanked. Simple as that. 

Ant Man, a second tier Marvel character (not a slight, he's just not Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, Cap,  etc) pulled 519 million global. Guardians, a movie featuring a talking tree and a snarky raccoon as main characters, pulled 773 million. 

DCEU is a failure at this point. Galdurn superman and Batman together couldn't  break a billion. Gimme a break. This is like coming up broke if it was raining cash. &&No no no, Justice League was a HUGE BOMB. It only made 650 milion on a budget of 300 million. That doesn't include marketing. JL was a massive flop and probably cost WB and DC tons of money.&&Yeah! The rushing was just one of the problems, not the only one. I mean, look at the fight scene in Infinity War between Spiderman, Tony, Bruce, and Dr Strange vs (edit) Ebony Maw. It's fast, frantic, has real stakes, and builds the characters and their relationships. It's an excellent scene and is just one among a huge host of great scenes in that movie. Justice League has nothing like that. It was ""Hero punches thing"" followed by ""Hero explains thing"", repeated ad nauseam. It was unforgivably mediocre.&&Superman made the movie boring. It was not tense or had the feel of dread that they might lose. Everyone could have gone home and just let Superman punch him once.&&Add to the fact that Justice League was already in production as Batman vs Superman hit theatres. WB assumed they had a definite hit on their hands then had to do a panic pivot as they found out the movie was a critical and commercial failure.&&Yeah, you specified movies in the earlier comment, but for Netflix it is as follows:

tbh I completely forgot Agent Carter and Inhumans even existed when making this list from memory, fortunately I checked the wikipedia article to be sure I got everything. There's also two episodes of Cloak and Dagger as of now, but that hardly seems worth adding until there's at least one season.

So, total screentime = 90:27 + 97 + 38:+17 = 225 hours and 44 minutes.&&Thanos needed the Infinity Gauntlet to focus the Infinety Stones' power for 'the snap'.  He needed the dwarves of Nidavellir to forge it but they were under Odin's protection.&&Yeah especially Odin. In the time of ragnorak, he destroys Xandar and get to Thor. Once he then also gets the space stone its just him teleporting across the universe to get them. 
Once Odin dies, he pretty much instantly(hard to say how soon since i have no idea how long passes on sakaar.  but id imagine a week or so given events on asgard, which matches the ""last week xandar was decimated"") attacks Xandar, then goes after the asgardians with power stone as insurance against the like of Thor. It makes perfect sense.&&Makes sense. Ego, despite his villainy was powerful and controlled major swaths of the universe. Odin and his army commanded galaxies. And the ancient one controlled time itself. 

Since all of them fell in quick succession, there was a power vacum. Doctor strange or thor weren't strong enough or prepared to take the places of their mentors.


As we saw,Thanos alone barely managed to defeat the Avengers without his gaulet. He'd be virtually powerless against greater powers. &&Alvin and the Chipmunks made $440 million? WTF?&&thats more than solo is going to made&&For example, Avatar had Sam Worthington in a starring role and yet people still went to go see it, so that right there is ten times more impressive than anything Avengers achieved.&&Jesus christ, that number is terrifying.&&Always drink a single small bottle of water and piss before the movie and avoid salty foods that make you drink more during.

Have it take place in the 60s/70s and just go straight camp, hard scifi. just like the [old cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6JX4Ok-MzA), only more fleshed out and realized. Thor:Ragnarok was cyberpunk. FF should be jetsons retrofuturism with big buttons and gears and giant computers with dot-matrix printouts showing the results of calculations to emphasize ""advanced technology""  (Jetsons/Buck Rodgers/ Fallout)


They can timetravel, but only to 50 years in the future. no more, no less. so if it takes place in july 1969, they can travel to july 2019. if the next movie takes place in 1971, they can travel to july 2021. Also, however much time passes in the future also passes in the past (their present). So if they leave at midnight july 5, 1969, they travel to midnight july 5, 2019. if they stay 10 hours, when they return to 1969, it is now 10am

keeps them rooted in hard sci-fi and also answers the question: where have they been in the mcu while allowing them to interact with present day avengers

ooh! and have TWO stan lee cameos: one in past and one in present (young and old)&&Right?  The brilliance and ego of Stark, the mysticism of Strange, the resources of Black Panther, the tactics of Zemo, and the rationale of a benevolent dictator.&&That's why Civil War worked so well&&Isn't Phil Coulson a movie original? That guy is one of the best characters in the mcu.&&Yea that will be interesting. I guess that’s never really happened before has it? Is there any good examples where a comic book movie had a totally new villain that’s never been featured in the comics?&&Supposedly Noah Hawley is working on a Dr. Doom movie.  And the nice thing is, the Fantastic Four likely wouldn't need to waste a film on an origin story.  Just let them hit the ground running, like Spider-man, and people will get it from previous movies + context.  The Beyonders is a problem but surely there's some way to create some other Deus Ex Machina for Doom to exploit.  And the Multiverse just wouldn't happen.  That'd be way too confusing and isn't totally necessary to do a riff on Secret Wars.  Just like having Death wasn't necessary to tell Thanos's story, despite being a big part of it in the comics.  You just have to shed certain details to make a movie fit the run-time sometimes.

So, yeah it would take some time, no doubt.  But I don't think a decade would be necessary.

Having said all of that, it's difficult to actually imagine a Secret Wars movie, because that was a wild ride to say the least.  But hey, I'd be 100% on board to check that out.&&A decade you say? Almost like Infinity War? Pretty sure that’s the point. We need build up for the payoff! &&Theres been 3 secret wars, the first just had ""a"" beyonder, and Dr. Doom manages to steal both Galactus and beyonders power.
The second, beyonder comes to earth and does a bunch of meaningless shit basically.
The third, we find out the first beyonder was just a baby, and there are an entire race of beyonders, all ridiculously powerful, and they are wiping out the entire Marvel multiverse for some reason.

Doom again steps up as the power hungry guy he is, finds a way to kill and steal all of the beyonders powers, and remakes the Marvel universe from bits of whatever hasn't been destroyed yet as his own world, with himself as its god.

It's really a very excellent piece of writing, with tie ins across multiple Marvel titles, and a big lead up.
&&More Dr. Doom please!&&Lmao, is this satire or does Dr Doom have that much swagger.&&So he is basically the same as Thanos?

Perfect show to watch with a kid and still get a laugh out of it as an adult.  It's no Gravity Falls, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty damn entertaining.  

A question though, do people hate it because it substituted something else?  Like is TT Go being made in lieu of a real Teen Titans show?  I can see being pissed if that were the case, I really don't know if it is though.&&The next time I watch a DC movie, it will be a free in flight movie&&I saw Infinity War and Justice League on their respective opening nights.

People cheered during Infinity War and that never happens in my small town. People really like those characters. The place went nuts when Thor made his appearance in Wakanda.&&I love the part in Civil War when Bucky realizes Spider-Man is a kid and at the same time he realizes he blocked his robot arm punch one handed. Meanwhile Spider-Man is just talking about how cool the arm is like it’s no big deal what’s going on.&&Ebony Maw. &&> ""Hero punches thing"" followed by ""Hero explains thing"", repeated ad nauseam

Liar. There's also ""Batman shoots thing"".&&Plus in IW, you get to see the characters use their powers together in cool ways, which is the best part of superhero teamups!&&> It was “Hero punches thing”

Nerdwriter did a whole episode on how bad DC fight scenes are, and that was his main problem with it.&&The villains in the DCEU, holy shit.  
Steppenwolf and Doomsday are just CGI obstacles. Not an ounce of character between them.   
And the CGI is ugly as fuck&&The punch hard league 👍&&What’s so great about Marvel fight scenes is that, you picked a different one from the same movie than I would’ve picked. I’m blown away by Starlord, Tony, Nebula, Doctor Strange, and Mantis. 

I hated the DCU fights. The final one in JL was essentially, everyone gets beat until Superman can single-handedly handle the problem. They all acted independently, and all their interactions were hamfisted and inorganic. &&I guess that just goes to show how much money a children's film can make when there's little competition. &&BO arguments get weird. This itself is such a strange chain of comments. People upvoted the guy claiming April makes a movie a ""summer release,"" then they upvoted the guy claiming it's harder for a movie to make money in the summer - *the most lucrative season for studios*.&&Perhaps there may be a solution to that terrifying number?&&Avengers 5 everybody fights Doom and find out it's only a Doombot at the end. &&I want a Dr Doom/FF movie with MF Doom + Dr Octagon soundtrack.&&They're Marvel's ""1st family"" and one of their earliest forays into the superhero genre and world building (Spidey's 1st appearance post Amazing Fantasy is in Fantastic Four). A lot of Marvel's foundation was built in their books.

The biggest alien presence in the Marvel Universe on par with the Kree are the Skulls (then probably the ~~bird jerks~~ Shi'ar), big time F4 baddies. &&Or just don't get caught up doing the weird sitcom bits, where half the film nobody has any powers and Dr Doom is just a regular dude until the very last fight.

I swear every Fantastic Four movie feels like it should be premiering on the CW after an episode of Arrow.


&&Fuck you. This is really cool and I love it. &&Moon landing took place in July 1969. Gotta incorporate that.&&Bitch now ima be disappointed with anything other than this &&Phil? His first name is Agent!&&It is my great hope that he makes it into A4.&&Not a movie, but Harley Quinn came from the animated Batman show.&&Not a film, but Harley Quinn was originally a one-off eye candy character in Batman: The Animated Series who grew into a recurring character, migrated to the comics, and is a pretty big deal.

Also the tragic version of Mr. Freeze is basically an entire new character with the same them and name, same source.&&There's so many comics out there that even if a new villain is created then you'd be able to say ""oh he's just a lex luthor type businessman"" or ""oh he's just this guy's tentacles with that guys backstory.""&&Well there was Superman IV....&&Yeah fuck a fantastic 4 reboot, do a full blown Dr Doom origin story.&&Just do it like the original Secret Wars where the Beyonder transports everybody to his ""arena"". Not the 2015 series but the older version could definitely work. 

&&Noah Hawley is an absolute genius so let's hope that movie happens. Legion and Fargo are some of my favorite tv in years so yes please give him a movie.&&Honestly... We don't need a full movie dedicated to F4 origin story. I think that's why the previous movies have failed.

You can have a very short recap (like a fake documentary, a SHIELD dossier, whatever): here are these 4 individuals, they got powers due to a rocket accident, they came back earth, SHIELD got ahold of them and worked secretly for them in hiding, Reed basically took Stark tech and made it a thousand times better (knowingly or unknowingly to Howard) and made advances of his own. Researching about dimensions, the F4 disappeared into the negative zone and no one knew/had the knowledge to rescue them and forgot because it was super classified). The last meddling with the gems made a tear in time and space, and suddenly the lost travelers are back to their dimension, wondering what could be wrong. &&To add more confusion, there's also the miniseries Secret War (singular) which is thematically unrelated but will likely appear in search results if someone's looking to learn about the Secret Warses.  It features some beautiful painted art by Gabriel Del'Otto though.&&[Two for](https://i2.wp.com/img.photobucket.com/albums/v646/bobmitchell/blog%20pics/its%20funny%20panel%20friday/SSST45B_zpseb81b448.jpg) [the road.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/816/665/fa3.jpg)

Bast agreed and gave Doom all of the vibranium.

Doom's mom is in hell and he's trying to save her.

Doom can be a sorcerer supreme.

Doom is one of the smartest people on the planet.

Doom's pride is legendary in Marvel. 

Edges out Vegeta in terms of pride.

Edit:

He also gave up love for power similar to Thanos in Infinity War.

He came from nothing - his family was poor gypsies.

The economy of Latevaria(the country Doom rules) was a poor country but it's economy became bigger than Japan's thanks to Doom.

He made Reed Richards(his arch-enemy) name his daughter after him for saving her[rather allowed him to name his daughter].

Loki is an ally of Doom and respects him on some level.

I could go on and on.&&MCU Thanos, maybe. Comics Thanos is a very, very different story.&&I'm pretty sure that's just Black Panther. He has cape for ceremonial occasions, I think?&&It's Black Panther, Older costume. &&He's so ridiculous, he's like a supervillain Chad in that virgin vs Chad meme. I love it.&&I'm sure he's entered rooms through the doors, they just need to be proper 10ft tall, 6 inch thick, ornately detailed centuries old double doors. Your standard North American single door isn't going to cut it.&&Like a peasant?

I like to imagine the little ol' Queen of England taking the same approach.&&The only thing bigger than his intellect is his ego, his whole hate for Richards stems from not being able to even consider that his experiment at college had a fault and assuming Reed must have sabotaged it somehow.&&Perfectly Balanced.&&A11: Dark of the Moon&&Plenty of 9S lewds out there too&&What is this...A CHARACTER ARC FOR ANTS?!?&&I'll do *you* one better. Why is Gamora?&&And each of those names has 6 letters. 3 of each is half. Or should I say, *perfectly balanced.*&&I dont like TT GO because I loved Teen Titans. It just really doesnt even compare. But the TTGO trailer looked hilarious&&>A question though, do people hate it because it substituted something else?  Like is TT Go being made in lieu of a real Teen Titans show?  I can see being pissed if that were the case, I really don't know if it is though.

This was one of the big reasons. I never really watched it myself but there was a highly beloved Teen Titans show on Cartoon Network for a while that eventually got discontinued and replaced with TTGO. Like Young Justice, it was mature enough with good character development and story archs to keep people interested who weren't just little kids. Also like Young Justice, some asshat decided to discontinue it for likely stupid reasons.&&That scene is an example of why I love the Russo Brothers so much. They pay extreme care to not only how the Heros are presented to the audience, but how they each uniquely react to each other.

Take Sam Wilson ""Falcon"" for example during civil war. Sam reacts to Bucky with apprehension and distrust every time, due to the latter attempting to kill him once (or twice). Meanwhile Sam always responds to Capt. America with the utmost respect and loyalty, being that Capt. America gave him a reason to fight again after his job counseling post\-war vets. In the same film, Sam has an a minor disagreement over the [Sokovia Accords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5jrdHASx04) with Col. Rhodes, another decorated Air\-Force veteran. Their banter, while brief shows awareness of each other's military background.

It's those minor details that make the characters so deep and real.

Bonus fan\-girl moment: I particularity liked how Rhodes and Wilson acted as Wing\-men and coordinated with each other during Infinity war.&&You forgot cgi lawnmower man from Suicide Squad &&No no. Flash just runs fast and mostly pushes things.  &&nobody ever knows what they’re talking about they want an echo chamber &&A final solution?&&Oh snap!&&Where would we find such a strong will as to execute it?&&Shit, are you the one writing the post credits scenes!?&&Spider-Man’s first appearance post amazing fantasy was amazing Spider-Man #1. It came out in March 1963, whereas fantastic four vol. 1 #21 came out in December 1963.&&Agent Son of Coul&&He has like 2 weeks to live in tahiti&&And Mr freeze origin in the comics and movies were changed to the animated series version&&I think I've seen that a few times now. The most recent I can think of is Robin in Dark Knight Rises, he's no Robin in particular, just shares some character traits.&&Nope. Nope. Uh uh. No. Just no.&&That is my dream, a Dr. Doom origin story would be a great way to start the next phase.  And a solo villain origin movie would be pretty unique. &&Ah yes, why didn't Thanos think of using a Helicopter, that way only like half of the avengers can reach him. Hahaha Hulk, have fun flying up and smashing these rotor blades.&&Holy shit I love Dr. Doom now, lol ***GIVE ME YOUR COUNTRIES!!*** and that fucking helicopter with 'Thanos' painted on the side. Amazing. I demand a Dr. Doom movie&&""give me your countries!"" that's fuckin funny&&> Bast agreed and gave Doom all of the vibranium.

Isn't it always argued that Bast agreed that Doom *believed* it to be true, and that was good enough for him?  Doom's conviction to his beliefs is worth more than how powerful he is.&&>He made Reed Richards(his arch-enemy) name his daughter after him for saving her[rather allowed him to name his daughter].

Haha, holy shit. What a legend.&&> Doom's mom is in hell and he's trying to save her.

He did, iirc.&&[The Oxford Dictionary had to create the word grandiloquent just so man could better describe Dr Victor Von Doom.]&&The virgin Thanos vs. The chad Victor Von Doom&&“What am I, a farmer?”&&As all things should be. &&When they drop “the” and it becomes **Avengers**

After that **Avenge**&&A12: Chipwrecked&&A12: Earth's Mightiest vs. Galaxy Far, Far Away&&Ah. Oh *no*. ^^:c&&What are we, some kind of Suicided Universe?&&I love Sam and Bucky's ""frenemy"" relationship in Civil War.  Since Cap is their mutual friend they are forced to play nice with each other but they don't like it.  Like when they are waiting in the car for Cap to get their equipment from Shannon and Sam tells Bucky to scoot the seat up and Bucky just ""nopes"" it.

The best part is when they are fighting Spidey together and both end up webbed on the ground.  Sam uses Red Wing to get rid of Spidey and Bucky tells Sam, ""You couldn't have done that earlier?..."", Sam's reply is just great.  ""I hate you so much..."".

When Cap eventually dies/sacrifices/disappears from the MCU, I'm most looking forward to how Sam and Bucky continue their relationship.  Which one picks up the mantle, and which one sticks around to help the other out of mutual respect for a shared friend.&&Sam! Where you at?...&&Not only that, they want validated by people agreeing with and even repeating each other.&&Perhaps Thanos could help.&&Victor somehow recovers part of Ultron (audience wouldn’t know this), uses it to create convincing android versions of himself, uses one of the bots to masquerade as himself, either infiltrates or is a direct threat to The Avengers, everyone is surprised at how easy it was to defeat it, movie ends with celebrating how awesome they’ve become since defeating Thanos, end credits reveals Doom infused with Stark nanobots and Ultron tech. 

Doesn’t sound right for an avengers film, but that would be sweet for F4’s intro to the MCU&&Wait, I thought Amazing Spider-Man #1 was Peter talking about how the F4 wouldn’t let him in so he was going to do his own thing. Am I misremembering?&&You're right, my bad. Marks his first major crossover, though. &&Thanoscopter^TM&&Yes and no. BAST looked into his soul to see if he was honest, and if his motives were pure. 

Doom proved that he was utilitarian, his actions were designed to help more than they harmed.

He then states that he has looked into ten thousand futures and humanity only survives in one. Where he rules. 

This statement must be honest, or BAST would have consumed him. Now, obviously there may be other futures he has not seen. But I will say it is pretty compelling evidence.

BAST also implies it has seen a million futures and then supports doom. Though it does not outright confirm Doom, it is heavily implied&&Bast does say that ""he too has seen the one path"" that leads to a world without evil and stuff before giving doom the vibranium. But he does also point out that doom ""believes it is the only way"" and agrees his intentions are pure.

Little bit of both really&&Bast specifically highlights that Doom truly ""believes"" his own path is the only way, but never explicitly confirms Doom's belief. 

Doom gets that access because he truly believes all his actions are for the greater good, even if his actions are individually reprehensible. He proves he is pure of heart and intent which was the test, not that he could actually protect earth from outside threats or from itself. &&AVGN&&Avenge, Avenge 360, Avenge One.&&The reboot that confuses everyone.

Part of the John Wick movies appeal is that the material is not really that good, but the cast and crew takes it very seriously anyway and puts enough charm into their performances to make it something unique and entertaining. And Keanu is completely in his element in a stunt-heavy, understated role.

It's kind of like  the star wars prequels, some of the actors could make their parts work and some couldn't.

The cinematography is great, the protagonist is an over the top unstoppable death machine, and the 'pew pew' scenes are really well choreographed (well, and come on, he's no Daniel Day Lewis but we all love Keanu). The universe is pretty much disposable. I'm excited for JW3, but the show? I'll wait and see what happens.&&I would absolutely love a video game based on the John Wick universe where you can create your own assassin character and take on missions, perhaps similar gameplay to the Hitman series. &&Yeah those TV episodes will cost a fortune. &&Huh, apparently it is. From Wikipedia:

* Titled ""The Continental""
* On Starz
* ""The series would tentatively focus on the hotel featured in the films, and the assassins who visit the safe haven""

Many series with high potential suffer a death by a thousand cuts from the original acceptance of the idea to working with the final constraints on the project. &&An impossible task?&&Metal Gear?!&&Beautiful.&&I once saw John Wick deflect three lighting bolts, with a fookin peencil.&&A *fooking* pencil, no less!&&""Keanu Reeves is John Wick as Kratos""&&I actually love that line cause it strikes unintentionally as dry humor, I don't think that it deserves that much hate but it's acceptable that its ridiculous lol.&&Well that’s just boring &&Yeah, I have always thought it was a pretty funny line.&&Halle Berry EDIT was misdiagnosed as a type one diabetic\-PLEASE read my post below this one. (autoimmune disease very different from T2, I've had it for 27 years). The first thing they tell you is to remain active. No problem for a 7 year old kid, did team sports, made sure to keep exercise regimen.  HB gets the benefits of looking awesome in an industry where traditionally, roles dry up for actresses at her age, but you pretty much can't function and will have multiple health issues (pump or not) if you don't.&&Agreed, they used to be hot, but now they just look otherworldly beautiful. Same with Gillian Anderson as well, she's aged very well.&&Nicole Kidman looked completely different 20 years ago and its not just aging.&&> Nicole Kidman

she doesn't even have fucking wrinkles &&No way Nicole Kidman looks better now. &&You forgot Kate Beckinsale!&&Pretty sure it did when everyone became an assassin in part two. &&Who can do that?&&Yes, he is in a medically induced comma because the knife damaged one of the heart valves.  That's why she wants his heart for Common.&&It's an easy mistake because they are both fluffy and cuddly. &&She didn't do much of anything.  IIRC she just looked menacing a few times and got killed rather easily by Wick.&&I never saw her in OitNB, but I loved her in John Wick 2. Good character, with excellent facial expressions and fight scenes. &&She was a very good facial actor with lots of kick\-ass fighting scenes.

Wish she got more arse\-kicking moments before her inevitable death by Reeves though.&&I think she's pretty hot tbh&&But they’re nice tits&&I have so much faith in the Wick trilogy that I’m actually excited to see how this helps her career. &&weary=tired

Wary is what you mean. ~ Cautious &&As long as she actually has a more important role than Ruby Rose. I didn't like her in the second one. She was just so boring and useless.&&I honestly can't remember a movie where she did a good job. She was awful in catwoman obviously, but she was also pretty awful in X-Men.&&I mean, has she ever been really good? I've seen Monsters Ball, I thought it was one of the most rote, hammy pieces of ""Oscar acting"" I've seen. Put on an accent, get naked, cry, and have an ""important"" message or somesuch. Is there some other really brilliant role I'm missing?&&I just don't think she thrives in generic action, which John Wick is \(but does it brilliantly of course\). She just passes off as a kind of plastic, tropey action hero. I thought she was brilliant in Cloud Atlas. Basically, if they wrote a great part for her, it'll be good. If it's sub par, she might come out like a sore spot.

I can think of a bunch of more appropriate actresses to be John Wick assassins, but it's not impossible that's I am proven wrong. Just don't have much hope for that particular choice.&&Good actors can elevate mediocre or poor material, and can come off looking good even in an otherwise bad movie or make a movie that shouldn't even be good work anyway. The writing in John Wick movies really isn't that good, but everyone making them does such a good job, and the script lets them do that, that you don't realize it. Halle is not the sort of actor who has shown she can do that.&&Not poor acting? Are we talking about the same person? She's had a couple of good performances (monsters ball) but mostly it's not very good. Did you see Die Another Day? I understand the movie was bad overall, but she was the worst part of it. Swordfish? She's such a wooden actress. &&jungle fever

I can't help but feel the world being shrouded in myth greatly benefits from the shroud. Even in the second movie, the detail that Winston approves the coins before they're put into circulation feels like an unnecessary bit of world-building. The first movie perfectly explains their function without bothering with their origin, because their origin doesn't matter.

I feel like a TV series will just be a lot of less tightly controlled world-building answering questions that don't need answering.&&I find that the universe feels like a modern D&D (or very early Shadowrun) setting. We're only seeing the Continental (Assassin's Guild) side of it, with a small glimpse at the other aspects from The Bowery King's Soup Kitchen (a network of spies) and The High Table (organized crime).

Certain things like the coins, the hotel are unique, but in the first jon wick, less is more. Much like the Star wars universe, it was cool finding out the tech behind a light sabre, but not so much about mitoclorians.

In layman's terms it means your glucose readings are sky high, pointing toward that you have 1\) a type of diabete\-if you haven't been diagnosed yet and 2\) \(General\) extremely elevated grs if you are a diabetic 3\) \(Specific\) You're probaly headed to the hospital regardless of type or dx\-I was diagnosed with DKA at my diagnosis and am a type one. Six years after my diagnosis, I was hospitalized and spent a week in an ICU due to DKA  \(kidneys were shutting down and I was headed into a coma\)\-the issue was that I was on the wrong type of insulin and was placed on a different faster acting insulin. If I'm off insulin for 30 min, I'm in DKA \(readings\-wise\) 30 minutes later.

Here's a short list of what I could find\-it seems that a lot of issues have come out, also misstatements \(on HB's part she weaned herself off of insulin and considers herself type 2 now, this is impossible you cannot wean yourself off insulin if you are T1, T2 yes\-see also ""honeymoon phase"" regarding both T1 and T2\) and misdiagnosis \(due her not being obese, HB was misdiagnosed as T1 but was actually T2\). Pub Med \(free with some paywalls for some journals\) has a wealth of info on misdiagnosis of the type of diabetes, DKA, and, flatbush diabetes\- one of the old names for what is now known as ketosis\-prone type two diabetes. The NIH website has great info as well.

I had the same realization myself after watching Atomic Blond which I expected to just be “Jane Wick” and while not a perfect film, or necessarily even a better film than the Wick movies, I was amazed at the realism of the fights. Minus one or two stunts the fighting is so *real*. People get tired quickly, extended fight scenes quickly turn into people hastily grappling at each on the floor while desperately trying to recover their stamina. &&The second was still entertaining but definitely lost some sparkle. This one will continue the trend from the looks of it. I guess that's what's happens when a good movie is made. The big wigs get a hold of it and put a pop spin on it.&&This is 100% my problem with the second movie!  The first movie was so fresh in the sense of realism in combat, even if John is implausibly great, but chapter 2 could have been any action series.  And tried too hard to hit the same beats as the first movie while making everything a little bigger and better, and in doing so left behind what actually made the first film so great.&&Oh man, that scene totally took me out of the film because of how absolutely ridiculous it was.&&Bruh when John Wick had to face a violinist and mothers walking their babys came on screen I was bamboozled.&&I said it in another comment her but I think part of her character is that she like's to think that she's a peer on John Wick's level but he doesn't regard her so. &&I assumed that last bit was like I'll see you in hell but maybe it was foreshadowing her being in the next movie&&There's two? &&I've yet to be convinced that she's anything other than a pretty face. &&That's her thing now, it feels like.

She basically passes it from one hand to the other in front of her, then passes it between her legs once (not a bounce pass, just literally handing it off to the other hand), then slams the ball off a wall, does an awkward jump, catches it, then does a superhero landing...sorta.

I would take his spending with a grain of salt.&&[This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2017/04/09/understanding-the-john-wick-economy/#55cce3a870ed) explains the system pretty well. 

Basically, you are not purchasing just a drink or just a hotel room, you are purchasing everything else that comes with it (secrecy, access to other services, security in the case of the Continental). 

Also, the coins ensure that an underworld of criminal services remains legit. If you are selling guns to assassins, and you use cash, you can charge arbitrarily, you can lie about what you sell and so on. With the coins, you have to exchange them at some point for cash, and this way you have to be more honest about your transactions. 

Its not about the value of the coin itself, but that the coins help keep the business of catering to criminals a viable and somewhat honest enterprise. &&I believe you give one coin and it gets you a certain amount of drinks. 

At least that's my theory. &&> Not to mention what makes the John Wick universe work so well is how little we know about it. Once they start trying to flesh it out more and make it less mysterious, I'm not sure it'll seem as cool

I'm pretty sure I heard on a podcast from the creators that the coins are meant to indicate that you belong to the club, if you have to count or worry about your coins then you don't belong anyway&&Not westworld, im tired of them dangling plot points every damn episode&&In a modern fantasy setting like this I think the equivalent of the Barbarian’s Guild would be like Soldiers of Fortune so they’d have an Arnold or Terry Crews as their top man.&&[deleted]&&Yeah the first movie was really cool but the second one kinda overdid it&&I think it really benefits TV when you can stick to 10\-13 episode seasons and you're not wasting money on filler episodes just to fill a schedule and it allows you to build better set pieces / action sequences.

First one was pretty interesting and well done for the time, but each sequel seems more and more like a lispy nerd is storytelling through tropes.&&I think a lot of people missed the point. Those weren’t assassins, they were just normal people. It’s showing how John is super paranoid because he’s wanted by every assassin everywhere now. &&I'm with you. I thin John though he was going to his death. And she said be seeing you as a call back to before at the continental.&&Unlikely. Remember [John wick vs common ](https://youtu.be/SEtz8FPLet0) he stabs him in the same spot as Ares. He says if you pull it out he will die and Common decided to live by not doing that. With Ares he granted no such privilege by just stabbing her and removing it [around 2:40](https://youtu.be/ORkZXNWmzyg). He gave common the professional courtesy but not her. Also I believe John Wick told a story earlier in the film about stabbing and leaving a knife in someone like common but that person refused and tried to keep killing john wick and removed it and died. 

Edit: just googled and saw that she has been confirmed to return in 3. So idk.&&That *is* what she gets hired for, isn't it?

Tbh, Kingman is a ridiculous premise, and hated the first one the first time I watched it through. But once I realized the whole movie wasn’t supposed to be taken seriously, especially with the awesome angles they shot, they’re both prettty good. First one is best though, very clean cut.&&Hanging him immediately came to my mind, too, but wouldn't that plan cause glass shards to rain down on the babies?&&Anyways, how's your thug life?&&Yipee!&&Fifteen. 15 shots in 6 seconds. They should have an epilepsy warning before that.&&My favorite. I’m convinced they edited it like this to mask Liam Neeson’s half-hearted elderly shuffling. &&This is solid gold.&&All that, and he still fell. &&No way is that fucking real. I’ve never seen Taken 3 but I can’t believe they did that many points of view for a fucking fence jump! 

The first one was ok, the second was a piece of shit so I never bothered with part three. &&It saddens me to see what Warner Brothers have been doing with DC. They lucked the fuck out with Nolan making amazing movies.&&This clip made me realize that he gets 6 seconds of hang time on that cane toss. Some quick math tells me that that means he threw it 144 feet in the air. Holy shit.&&Definitely the catwoman scene, holy fuck thats one of the worst ways to put friendly sexual tension in a romantic plot&&My name is Electric Nachos?&&Not even close. The Daredevil scene had better shots, cuts, and overall choreography. It also made a lot more sense. Neighborhood kids see a fight like that going on they're going to be interested. Neighborhood kids see two grown adults standing in their basketball court they don't ask them to go one-on-one, they ask them to get out of the way.&&Daredevil was actually entertaining because it was a fight.  This ""basketball game"" one one shot, and lots of ass shaking and body grinding.

Also, I love that line about her holding back, and the smirk when he says not to.&&Seriously though that Daredevil scene is pretty awful. &&Based on what she’s wearing, the dude is Prince &&Nah, that was a magic trick.&&Ta-da!&&Rest In Peace&&If it was whatever was in that case when he dug up the concrete cache then it's not that many&&Also worth noting, a drink didn't cost a coin.  The coin was the tip to the bartender; who's very clearly good at her job.&&Then why do things require more than one coin if the value isn't important? If you're correct wouldn't everything just be one coin?&&Amen to that. Westworld suffers from “leave them with nothing” 

If they wanted to have a show with overarching mysteries about the entire nature of the park, you need to have an engaging plot in the meantime. 

Lost (a severely flawed show in it’s own right) was at least entertaining and kept you hooked because it focused so heavily on character development and it gave you smaller mysteries that could be solved along the way. Everything was obviously connected to the main mystery at the end, but you tuned in the next week to see conclusions the to current situation, not because “I’ll be one step closer to the final answer”

Every episode of westworld just hints at what they’re going to reveal at the end of the season. Which makes for very boring TV. After the first few times they mentioned “the maze” in season 1, it never directly made the episode you were watching more interesting.&&Westworld is taking a dive. The acting, in my opinion, is terrible by all but Harris and Hopkins, and one isn't really in the show anymore. Dolores monologing to everyone is really cringy. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but the show could be so much better. &&Terry *loves* extralegal paramilitary forces.&&I think it's worth mentioning that Chinese Wuxia worlds have long had this concept of a 'Gai Bang' ie beggar's association, a group of poor and/or homeless people forming a powerful political group. A lot of classic Wuxia novels have this.

Feels pretty cool to have this replicated in a modern western fantasy world. &&I think these days we're in a golden age of high quality TV, and I just don't think you can stretch consistently good story telling into 22 episodes. 10-13 is perfect. It allows you to stretch the good, and condense the weak, and focus your budget. Shows like Altered Carbon and The Expanse really show that.

Also Altered Carbon is brilliant. Great mind bending sci-fi with a fantastic cast, great performances, and jaw dropping CGI. Very worth it.&&I've been meaning to watch it, but the fights seem a bit tame? I think someone needs to sell it to me really. I've watched the forest fight and the rain fight, and wasn't that impressed. Bear in mind, I can't help but judge everything against The Raid, John Wick, or Atomic Blonde.&&How bout Low Winter Sun?  Or Hell on Wheels?  Or whatever show AMC uses The Walking Dead to advertise for in such a way that I never want to watch it &&So fucking good! I really enjoyed it a lot.&&""Tiberius, I'd finish!

Seems like it would be simpler to just go for a head shot.&&I also love how [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNLYNkjU9g) is almost believable.&&Ya. [Here's the stunt director breaking down the scene](https://youtu.be/3axtK6iI7lw). It's crazy&&Have you seen Resident Evil: The final chapter? Whole movie is just like that. I got a migraine trying to watch the first 10 minutes of it.&&I mean, that's clearly the reason. He's no spring chicken. &&Taken 2 was the first movie where I noticed that good guys have iPhones and bad guys have off brand flip phones.&&Taken 3 made Taken 2 look like Taken one.&&Yeah the taken fence jump is extra egregious because not only is it super fast cuts, but the camera is constantly changing sides as well. At least the catwoman one, the hoop is always to the left of the camera.&&Honestly I didn't even know they made a third one. How many damn times has his daughter been kidnapped??&&I guess it comes down to directors. Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan did great work. I wasn't mad at Man of Steel either and Wonder Woman while not amazing was entertaining for an hour or so; in my opinion it was the most ""Marvel"" of the recent DC movies.


^^^I ^^^wasn't ^^^impressed ^^^with ^^^Black ^^^Panther ^^^by ^^^the ^^^way&&Also he actually throw it sideways.&&Hey, let's build sexual tension while surrounding the two characters with cheering children. Not creepy at all.&&I looked her up out of disbelief, her canonical last name is ""Natchios"" which might as well be Nachos. Why.&&""Master forgive me, I have to go all out, just this once""&&Game blouses.&&I doubt that's his only stash of coins.&&And it's not like it's one coin per drink.  For all we know a single coin would be enough to cover the drinks for his entire stay *and* constitute a generous tip.&&I dont know for sure, but it seems things that happen outside of the Continental is what requires more than a single coin, (like body clean up), so perhaps the one coin per service only really applies to services within the Continental because of how much foot traffic they receive, being a hub for the underworld. &&It's just not something to think about too deeply. They wanted to add a cool little currency system but didn't put much thought into it.&&Maybe there's a criminal coin stock exchange where they can check its rates and exchange value.&&There's also the view that coins may be tips. It's a gracious way of showing how awesome you are, that you can drop a coin on a server.

Another view is that coins represent a favor (at least initially). When you get a job you get a certain number of coins (favors) that will be needed. This are weapons, safe-houses, cleanup, and actual assassination. If multiple people help you, or a person does multiple favors, this would require payment in multiple coins. Most of these favors are services given by the continental (but membership may not be needed to get value from the coins) and favors can be very powerful as they cover all needs. You may receive multiple coins for the ""expected favors"" you are going to get. In a way a person with many coins is someone who gives more than they receive. The continental accepts ""donations"" as a favor. Seeing coins as having a value, or comparing favors among the intercontinental may be seen as crass. This would be one of the greatest values of the continental: you get what you need as you need it, cost not seen as a problem, only how valuable an asset you are to the network.

Notice that many payments on people are done in cash. I'd imagine that getting an assassin to do a job for you may require a pre-payment in coins (which may be substantial, but useless to the assassin if they break inter-continental code) covering the favors needed and the favor the assassin is doing to you. Then there's a separate payment in money. If the job is attractive enough assassins would put in their own coins, not doing the job as a favor, but instead as a business.

This also matches the idea that the Continental is autonomous of external views of power. Even the idea of monetary value of anything is, in itself, just another form of external power. The continental only values it's own concept of power: favors among criminals.&&Oh God I can't stand Dolores scenes, its just so dumb they have to speak about robot philosophy every episode. Although the Japanese arc was interesting, but that's the only thing u enjoyed about this series. &&Fair enough, I am a big action fan. Don't really care for what the style is, into the badlands  looks like it takes cues from Hero and Crouching tiger styles of fight choreography. Also its got one of the best villians IMO (first season).&&John Wick and The Raid are my go-to comparisons as well. All others are judged against them. Loved your comment and had to chime in haha&&They truly mastered the art of Antiquity swearing, that's for sure. I absolutely love the dialogue in that show. I loved the way they phrased things in really round about archaic manners like that and the way they used direct translations of Latin proverbs and stuff. They really went in on some of the details.&&I think salma has aged the best of all women&&Lynda Carter and Sofia Loren are both hot AND eligible for AARP benefits.&&Sandra Bullock?&&Monica Bellucci *drops mic*&&Kim Bassinger was there for a long time, but I just looked her up and she had some bad Botox or something.&&Sigourney Weaver&&I was 13 when Desperado came out, which happened to coincide with puberty and raging hormones. I stayed up many a night playing that VHS on slow-mo. Salma was my first celebrity crush and I still think she's one of the hottest women on the planet. &&I actually really enjoyed that part.

If you're generic bad guy and don't play candy crush or whatever, flip phones are superior. Their battery lasts ages because they're not infested with bloatware, and because they're built on older technology that isn't attempting to cram everything possible into a slim casing where a screen takes up an entire surface, they're a lot more resistant to being dropped.

How many times have you seen someone break a flip phone? I'm gonna wager it's in the single digits. I can't even remember anyone who's managed to break a flip phone without leaving it open and like, sitting on it or something.

Meanwhile I can't even count the amount of times I've seen someone crack a screen dropping a phone or sitting on it and even just sitting down with it in their back pocket or whatever.

If you need reliability and functionality over fancy touchscreen functions, a flip phone is absolutely what you'd pick.&&https://youtu.be/3p-lyt78cyA&&Idk what they were thinking handing so much of it to Snyder.&&Well, would it be LESS creepy if they WEREN’T cheering?&&All these below comments are junk, but their context still works for either daredevil or catwoman scene... strangely similar... similar... and terrible...&&It was one coin per body.&&Maybe the service is the disposal of ONE body?&&You've persuaded me a bit more. I love a good villain.

And Hero is just a ludicrously great film.&&Oh man, I'm glad I'm not the only one!

I rewatched The Raid back to back the other night. Honestly I think The Raid 2 may well be the best action movie I have ever seen. That last half an hour is just a symphony of violence. You can feel the exhaustion in Rama and the way he holds himself. He really delivered in that movie.&&I don't think she's aged at all.

This is some police brutality. &&That comic style on screen is a fantastic idea. So excited for this! &&Wow.

Looks visually stunning, especially those city shots. &&Spiderman Too: 2 Many Spidermen&&I hope Spider-Ham is in the movie.&&I actually love the art direction in this. Feels completely new. It's sort of looks like if Laika did a Fully CGI movie. The banter with the dad looks great too. &&Jake Johnson as an older, grizzled Peter Parker imparting comedic life wisdoms is the best part of this whole affair&&The glass shattering as he jumps off the building is such a nice touch. You can already tell the amount of detail and work thats gone into this movie, I'm unbelievably exited.&&The animation is seriously incredible.&&10/10 All in. Looks great.  ""Dad, I love you... THAT'S A COPY""&&Hopefully this does REALLY well.  There's a ton of comic book stories that would lend themselves to animation rather than live action.&&LOVE the new style. &&[Spider-Gwen](https://ephmedia.giphy.com/8e5fe631-7ed0-4ff9-9b4e-f6f41cb33539.gif) is voiced by [Hailee Steinfeld](https://imgur.com/gallery/amlm5) (she’s pretty busy right now)&&Looks amazing!!!

This is written by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, right?&&I thought john krasinski was the voice of peter parker in the first teaser trailer? Now it changed to that guy from new girl. Odd.&&This looks fucking incredible &&I'm not even joking, this is already one of the most visually stunning animations I've seen. &&I have never thought there are animation styles other than CG, painted and stop motion

I can't even tell what style is that but it looks insane &&Finally somebody has evolved 3D animation to be more that just photo realism with Pixar type characters.

This looks like an amazing kinetic comic book come to life. I'm floored.

As a huge Spidey fan, I couldn't be happier with this direction.&&""What's Comic Con?""

Hahahahahaha&&This looks phenomenal holy shit&&Anyone want to explain how the Spidermen travel inter-dimensionally?&&That Comic-Con gag at the end gave me a good chuckle.

This looks really cool!&&##Whoa, that was sick. 

2018's definitely turning out to be the Year of Fourth-wall Breaking Movies hah. &&Wait...is Peter Parkers spiderman wearing sweatpants at the end of that trailer?&&THIS is the kind of thing Sony's animation department is capable of. I can't believe they wasted talent on The Emoji Movie.&&this movie looks great. Between the upcoming game and into the spider-verse, Homecoming really kicked off a spiderennaisance. &&This is the only upcoming non mcu spider-man movie i'm going to see&&Brian Tyree Henry (Paperboi) is everywhere - He voices the dad in this one. Last 4 different movie trailers I watched had a role for him. &&You gave me Spidey I got you Spidey&&Looks absolutely fucking spectacular&&Okay, I'm fangirl\-screaming over here. Three\-cups\-of\-coffee ramblings of a comics reader incoming.

So, they're fucking adapting the entire ""what if Gwen Stacy became Spidey?"" storyline and like, it's been such an excellent direction for her character and I'm still salty about her solo series' cancellation. It was so stylish! But since her entire origin story involves Peter getting killed off in her universe... yeah, bring tissues, non\-comic fans.

Fuck yeah, Miles is finally showing up on the big screen! And with his invisibility powers, to boot! Kinda curious about how they'll handle his electric spikes, though, because those things are OP in the comics. I have a feeling that they'll prob need a major nerf for drama\-preservation purposes. Also, sorry, Peter doesn't survive his origin story either.

Also, Peter Parker finally shows up as an adult on the big screen! Prob alive through alternate\-universe\-travel shenanigans, because it's looking like at least a good chunk of the movie might be taking place on Miles' home turf. Can't really comment much on him because I've only seen grown\-ass Peter Parker in the new run of Spiderman/Deadpool and he was some kind of big\-shot CEO in that thing. Which he clearly isn't here.

Anyways, I was already intending to go watch this thing on the first weekend after release because of the sweet cinematography in the first trailer but this trailer just made me decide to go see this thing on the premiere day (preferably with as many friends and classmates as possible in tow).&&[Spidermen Too: 2 Many Spidermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bw1OlVdZ2U)&&Gwen Stacy's feet when she landed is so elegant and strong too! &&Good news, bad news:

Good news: this looks incredible, and is now totally a film I'm looking forward to.

Bad news: if Sony pulls this off, it's only going to embolden DC in their desire to release films with multiple versions of the same characters concurrently (eg both a Jared Leto Joker movie and a Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie).&&Looks like it just might be the best Spidey movie ever. &&[removed]&&It's very weird to me that they made Miles' dad a cop, in a movie which also features Gwen Stacy.  Her entire thing was how her dad was a cop and desperately trying to protect her identity as a superhero.  

It feels similar to them basically giving Peter elements from Miles' Ultimate comics in Homecoming (the charter school, the overweight asian best friend, the various power upgrades, etc.)

That's just my nerdy nitpicking though.  This looks absolutely fantastic.  Art style is so fucking unique for these superhero movies.  OST sounds like it's going to be great.  Peter sounds a bit weird, but we'll see how it turns out.  &&Why does it look like the animation is stuttering? It really messes with my head.&&That radioactive spider really gets around. How many spider people *are* there?&&I wonder how he got those $800 Jordan 1 Chicago's&&Looks great! If only Sony could have done this with Venom too.&&Ah, so Spider Gwen. Too bad no GwenPool&&This movie is going to be bonkers! Christmas can't come soon enough.&&I was thoroughly enjoying the trailer, thinking Yeah this looks pretty sweet. Then Spider-Gwen showed up and I was like Oh fuck yes! (I just love her design so much.)&&Looks amazing, but I can't help seeing Nick Miller when I hear that voice.&&Young black man can't even go to school without getting harassed by police. Tragic. 

Good trailer. I have no interest in Venom, but this looks fun.&&They had me with the teaser. The animation style is just amazing. Spidergwen looks pretty great in this style, as they all do. I just really hope this can live up to expectations when it comes to the story and writing. Because at this point we can be sure it'll be a beautiful movie visually. I'm not too worried, though.&&Which song was that when miles jumps off the tower in slow mo? &&It's art is really well done but I'm not a fan of the low frame animation.&&what the fuck!? the art style is wacky as hell&&I think I’m hearing two different peter parker voices? The first two lines sound like John Krasinski while the rest is definitely Jake Johnson. I know it doesn’t make sense but Krasinski was cast once https://www.google.com/amp/wegotthiscovered.com/movies/john-krasinski-play-peter-parker-spider-man-spider-verse/amp/&&Finally Kingpin in a Spidey film!&&Isn't he Morlun?&&Come on, he's a good cop, probably only a few days away from retirement.

His odds of surviving the movie are 928343824 to one.&&He made too many jokes to be the sacrificial lamb. Definitely comic relief.. I hope&&He doesn't die in the comics if that makes you feel better. However they could still have him killed who is to say.&&Weeelllll in the _books_...&&I'll do you one better, he shoots his own son&&And he has to ride in his dad's car in the back seat.

Actually how does that even work? Cop car doors in the back seat shouldn't open freely. His dad would have had to open up the doors for him. &&That cop murdered that unarmed black kid ^'s ^social ^standing&&That scene is gonna make me go see the movie.&&Even if the movie sucks (Not likely) I'll watch it just for the visuals. 

It's so pretty I just want to watch it again and again.&&This is getting out of hand. Now there's two of them.&&""And I will crush that Spiderman! And then that other Spiderman! And ALL THE SPIDERMEN! Til I'm the SPIDERMAN!""&&2Spider2Man&&JJ is gonna have an aneurysm&&And 2099

And Noir&&If there isn't even a nod to my man Peter Porker I will be very upset.&&But who could play the voice...?

Trick question Danny DeVito is the only answer.&&Spider\-Pig will have to do&&Let's not forget [Italian Spiderman.](https://youtu.be/UhHhXukovMU)&&I know, this movie looks gorgeous!

My one complaint is that Peter looks like a hobo [Kent Mansley](https://houseofgeekery.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1999_the_iron_giant_047.jpg)&&Am I supposed to have 3D glasses on? That double image might be very jarring in actual 3D though.&&It reminds me of what the Telltale Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us games would look like if they were working with film-quality 3D models instead of game-quality.&&He's basically playing a superpowered version of his character from New Girl, and I love it. &&I legit thought it was Lil Dicky for a good while there lmao&&Eh? I thought Jim from the office was Peter Parker. Must've misremembered&&His attempts to get out of paying for food don’t feel like Peter, they feel like Nick from New Girl. Unless there’s a Schmidt Spider-Man, it’s just weird. &&I swear I hear him for the first two spider-man lines in the trailer. Maybe there’s two Peter Parker’s from two realities? &&Kind of a dick move though. One of those wind-resistant sheets of toughened glass is super expensive. Not to mention how there are now sharpened shards falling hundreds of feet on to a city sidewalk.&&I hope you enter again.&&I wish it were smoother but it's expressive as hell.&&seriously there is LOADS of potential for this! It both looks great and the writing's pretty good.&&I feel like The Rock is gonna see this trailer and think ""How was I not cast as the dad!?""&&Hijacking top comment to say my brother was one of the lead creatives for this movie and had a lot to do with the visuals, and I'm practically bursting with pride seeing the full trailer and poster finally drop!! [Link to his instagram, @theokartist](https://www.instagram.com/theokartist/)&&Please don't kill the daddy.&&[Great dad, just in time for Father's Day](https://vlipsy.com/vlip/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-dad-i-love-you-thats-a-copy-xXB9FBqN)&&The dad is already my favorite character.&&It would also give Sony their own little universe to play around in, with an actual Spider-Man they can use so they can stop trying to make the Spider-Manless Edge Verse they're going with.&&Whoa, buddy, *love* the new outfit.&&It's awesome. It almost looks like cel-shaded claymation/stop motion.&&Yeah I really can't compare this style to any other I've seen. I hope marvel does this with more movies. 

Edit: my bad... I mean Sony&&I really hope Gwen has a heart to heart moment with a peter like in the comics, where they talk about how they couldnt save their peter and their Gwen, respectively.&&Really hoping she has a major role in the film. Ever since my son saw her pop up in Ultimate Spiderman she's been his favourite incarnation of the character.&&I'm out of the loop re: the comics but wouldn't calling yourself ""Spider-Gwen"" kind of give part of your secret identity away?&&oh dang, I thought it would be dove cameron. &&So glad shes getting more roles now. Hopefully she breaks out this year with Bumblebee and this. 

The world needs more Hailee Steinfeld.&&Both of them are producing it, but only Phil Lord  wrote the script&&I think they're both in it. I think Spidey that teaches him is different from the Spidey that saves him. When Miles was rescued the voice sounded like Krasinski. &&I think Joe Johnson's Spider-Man is from another universe. If it follows the ultimate storyline then the original Peter Parker dies

*Jake Johnson, my bad &&Part of Miles' origin is Spider-Man dying when he was a few weeks into having his powers. 

He feels guilty that he didn't do anything with his powers to help. 

Essentially Peter is Miles' Uncle Ben. Especially when he hears 'with great power, comes great responsibility' from the funeral. &&Calling it now, this will be the best Sony Spiderman movie ever.&&I didn't care at all before I watched this. Now I'm furious I have to wait till fucking December to see this. &&At first: *what are they trying to do...*

By the end of it: *I need more of this.*&&Never have I so truly meant this, but this film truly takes advantage of being animation. It couldn't possibly be done otherwise and MY GOD does it look absolutely fucking amazing. It's actually hard to believe that they translated the visuals of a comic to the screen so perfectly.&&I don't like the low framerates..&&It is so much fun and perfect. &&I really dislike the particular style it's done in, but even I will attest to how professional and smooth it looks.&&CG, painted and stop motion are more of methods of animation, which can all be used to create a unique style. Just look at the difference between Aardman and Laika films - both stop-motion, yet both completely unique.

It's the same with this film - CG, but a wonderfully creative style made with it.&&It's just unique CG. Phil Lord and Chris Miller have kind of made that their thing.  &&My understanding is that it's CGI, but with what looks like a limited frame rate to kind of replicate stop-motion and hand-drawn textures incorporated into the CG.

So, kind of all of them?&&It’s crazy how 3D animation exploded and Pixar has been such a standard since Toy Story. 

The industry really fell into the groove of “if its not broken, don’t fix it” to an extent. The last big animated movie I was impressed with their art direction was Kubo.  

EDIT: before I get more comments about how Kubo is stop motion, I was referring to just animation in general. I understand the difference. &&Feels like a Deadpool line hahaha&&I went from 'Oh another animated comic movie' to 'HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK I WANT TO WATCH THIS!'&&Spider verse, the comic series, explains it as the mutiverse being a Web, with different universes connecting each other with strings of fate. The spider people are all considered ""totems"" and their access to the web, subconsciously allows for spider sense (vibrations in the web of the mutiverse)

As for direct travel, they have watches that connect them to the webkeeper, which is a large part of the comic story so I won't go into detail on that. But the keeper pulls them out onto the web and into ""earth 0"" where the web is physical.&&Deadpool 2, Wreck it Ralph 2, This

The self awareness is off the charts&&Does it break the fourth wall? Comic books still exist in their universe so surely comic conventions do too, right?&&Probably cause it’s cold wherever they where, not like a permanent costume change or something&&Sometimes you learn more from your failures than a success.&&Hey if the cash they raked from that awful movie was to fund this movie then I'm alright with it.&&A-fucking-men to that. So many shitty Spiderman games and half assed movies, and now it finally feels like Spidey being given the right treatment.&&What other upcoming non mcu Spider-Man movies are there?&&Goddamn, Hotel Artemis looks so dope.&&gave me spidey got you spi.... you you gave me spidey i got you spidey maan! we're even, we're even Uncle Ben!!&&Sensational!&&It sounds like an odd thing to point out, but I kinda noticed that too. It’s like she landed en pointe like a ballerina and then just kept walking that way and it was beautiful. I love Spider-Gwen and it looks like they nailed it with her as well as Miles. Now I’m excited to see what other Spider-People we’ll get. Fingers crossed for at least Silk, and hopefully Madame Webb, Spiderwoman and Spider-Girl (Anya version). &&kinda irrelevant but i want to see how powerful the spider people are. arent gwen and miles supposed to be significantly weaker than peter?&&I'd be totally fine if DC decides to do this instead. They really messed up their cinematic universe to the point its not really fun to see. Random solos will just get to the point and have fun with the characters&&I’m not so sure that’s a bad thing. Clearly, Marvel is currently the only studio that has figured out how to do the whole “interconnected universe” thing. For everyone else, it seems to be creative poison. The best X-Men movies of the past several years are the ones who dropped any sense of continuity and just did their own thing. If different writers/directors/actors have their own takes on characters, I’m fine with that as long as they’re interesting &&> Bad news: if Sony pulls this off, it's only going to embolden DC in their desire to release films with multiple versions of the same characters concurrently (eg both a Jared Leto Joker movie and a Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie).

Eh, I could honestly go for more bold standalone blockbusters. Different takes on Batman, rapidly, not beholden to trilogy structures or cinematic universes. I'd almost prefer it. Don't get me wrong, I love the MCU, but, I really don't need *everything* to be a massive interlinked thing. 
&&I have you seen he release list for that weekend. All those movies are fucked. All these premiere the same weekend:

Uhhhhh that would be amazing wtf&&an unreleased vince staples song i think?&&Miles's dad was a cop in the comics though. &&It's made to look like stop\-motion animation.&&So, 3D anime employ a similar thing. The animation is intentionally stilted to look more like, well, 2D animation. It can be a bit jarring and some things do it way better than others. &&Well it only had to bite 1-2 people per reality&&It only bites one person per universe.  Each of those Spider People are from different universes&&stockX&&Alternate universe where they are cheap dude &&His uncle is a thief technically. Maybe he stole them for him, and he don't know they're stolen.&&Rated R, animated Venom/Carnage would be rad.&&Why would gwenpool be in a spider-verse movie?&&I mean they still could, Gwenpool isn't Gwen Stacy, but I'd still say it's  unlikely. &&What's up with Gwen Stacy (of all characters) being turned into multiple superheroes? Why is that a thing?&&gwenom is where its at!!!!!!!!!&&Wacky in a good way! Not liking Peter's voice though. A little raspy.&&I think Krasinki is the Peter that saves Miles in the beginning, and he probably dies, and Jake is a Spidey from another universe that comes to mentor him.&&I still really hope they bring Vincent D'Onofrio's version of the character into a future MCU Spidey film. &&I mean you can't really do him justice in live action. The Daredevil show had an amazing *version* of Kingpin, but ***the*** Kingpin is literally the size of a family sedan and mean as shit.&&Wait Morlun is in this one? Thats awesome&&is he too old for this shit ?&&Also he's the black cop in an action movie featuring a superhero. He's literally set up to die if they follow every action trope in the book.&&Tony, there was no other way. &&Killing off the comedic relief is a fairly common tactic, mate.&&I'm gonna go with 'it's a movie' on that one.&&Roll down the window and the person reaches outside and pulls the handle.&&Because his universe looks and feels just like yours, but just a little bit different.

Coke is spelled wrong and cop cars have power locks that the driver can trigger from his door.&&Different universe, different rules&&I haven't been in a cop car, but it would seem unsafe if it you were always unable to open the back doors. I know some cars have a switch for child locks, is that the same for cop cars?&&That's a setting in the car door that he could change just to mess with his son.&&Seriously, I've seen enough raw footage of young black people dying ^^on ^^the ^^inside&&>Even if the movie sucks (Not likely)

While this looks good, this is Sony and trailers can be deceiving. A healthy dose of skepticism is advised here. Remember, this is the same studio that brought us the Emoji Movie&&The upside down shot of him free falling is art, period. I would pay for a blown up print of that. I would frame that and hang it proudly in my living room.

In the burger scene at 1:10, you can see the counters and menus in the background have chromatic abbreviation whereas the characters and waiter are in focus. When you have an over shoulder camera shot of the white dude, his body is affected by chromatic abbreviation. So seems like it's meant to be used as a depth of field sort of thing.  
It's an inventive way of using the effect; I personally think chromatic abbreviation looks horrendous though and particularly when used in animation as it can look quite jarring.  
  
Edit: Aberration not abbreviation. Only a genius makes the same mistake four times...&&[deleted]&&Chromatic Aberration.

It is pretty jarring and probably my only beef with the art direction here. I get that they were aiming for the comic book 'texture' but I can't help but think that this level of utilization is going to turn some people off.

&&I'm not kidding - I just put on red/cyan anaglyph 3D glasses and a lot of shots actually are 3D when you watch them that way because of the chromatic abberation.

None of that matters though cause we need a Schmidt Spider-Man.&&Its a different universe. He might not have the currency of that universe. &&It has happened in the comics several times.

He doesn't have pockets in his suit.&&I don't know, feels pretty close to the 30-something Peter from the 2000's Amazing comics. &&Peter does this CONSTANTLY in the comics.

The Uncanny Valley has tanked so many projects it's a wonder why they kept trying as long as they did. This goes all the way back to *Final Fantasy: Spirits Within* and beyond- realism was treated as the holy grail. Don't get me wrong, realistic 3D animation is an amazing tool that Disney in particular has been making groundbreaking use of, but this film and some other recent ones have really shown the power of embracing being animated.&&Just this morning I stumbled across the [Awaken Akira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY1QHpp6iEE) video and thought I had seen the most visually striking cinematography I'd see all day.  Boy was I wrong.

The comic-esque quick cuts, spastic action, and beautiful colouring are all fantastic but man that shot of Spidey falling upside down and slowly into the city is breathtaking.&&Except this Movie is being directed by 3 different people. Both Lord and Miller are executive producers, and only Lord is credited for writing the screenplay.

While I'm sure they had a hand in the visual identity of the film, the two of them aren't the only ones responsible for making the movie look the way it does&&Yeah that would be my best guess too&&At least looks better than the choppy 3D anime that I have so much trouble enjoying for whatever reason. They do the lower frame rate for a similar reason, and it just doesn't jive well with me, but this does.&&Spiderman is known for breaking 4th wall&&Deadpool is honestly just exaggerated 'adult humor' Spiderman. His design is even just an unused Spiderman design.&&Thanks a lot. That's super odd, seems like it may be tough to transition that to the big screen, but I guess we'll see!&&Also The Lego Movie 2&&> Sometimes you ~~learn~~ earn more from your failures than a success.

Miles is definitely a step below Parker in the comics, but is strong in his own right.&&DC animation has been pretty good as well. They've dived off a cliff these most recent few, but still much better than marvel animation. &&>  The best X-Men movies of the past several years are the ones who dropped any sense of continuity and just did their own thing.

i mean, arguably the best x men movie was the one with the MOST continuity of the bunch: days of future past. all the other recent ones have tried to tie in the movies: the wolverine directly working off x men 3, origins having cylopse and xaveir appear, logan having xavier and talking lenghty about the x men, deadpool directly adressing the other x men movies, and deadpool 2 having the actual x men in them. 

x men apocalipse and first class are the most standalone of the bunch.&&GIVE ME THE VERSION OF BATMAN FROM FLASHPOINT PARADOX&&Except for in that one universe, where a regular spider gets bitten by a radioactive Pig.&&I wanna go there&&God, the low frame rate attempt to mimic atop motion + the comic book style textures and shading + Carnage's weird goopy tendrils would be *so* unnerving.

Shit even outside her comic but within marvel, she's misrepresented terribly (SELFIES LOL)&&Especially since Gwenpool isn't in the Spider-Verse storyline.

Then again, this doesn't seem to be following the Spider-Verse storyline. &&for those who don't know gwenpool is [from our universe or one like it where this is all comics and movies etc. She has found herself stuck in the marvel universe and got a costume so not to become an extra.

Gotta be spider related, not Peter Parker related I assume?&&Gwenpoole isn't Gwen Stacy at all.

She literally supposed to be aome chick from ""real world Earth"" who got stuck in a comic.  She is closer to Deadpool than Spider Gwen or Gwen Stacy.  &&Gwendolyn Poole aka gwenpool just shares the name with Gwendolyn Stacy. It's not the same character.

&&Gwen Stacy is only a superhero on Earth-65, on that earth she gets bit by the spider instead and Peter becomes Lizard &&Infinity War made me want to get into comics and the Gwenom stuff was awesome.

I haven't really looked at comics very closely since I became an adult and an artist myself. I was never interested in comics as a kid but looking at this excerpt here, the coloring and attention to detail for *just one page* is phenomenal. 

Just the time spent drawing the individual knots in the webbed holding for the kid, these artists must have been incredibly passionate for their work. &&Man, Hickmans run of the FF was so good.

That sounds nothing like Krasinski. &&That's definitely not Krasinski&&Holy shit. Never knew /r/amazingmemes existed. That is a weird place.&&Every frame looks like it could be one of those digital style Wallpapers&&It's something that Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks realized, I think. They make the characters believable but obviously cartoonish, even in grounded movies. It is far easier to get into it that way than when they look like weird wax CGI versions of real people.&&Even many “cartoony” 3D animated films do seemingly nothing that couldn’t feasibly be done equally in live action with CG.  From this trailer alone there are several things that constrain it strictly to the world of animation, and it looks gorgeous and immersive.&&I think they had to go as far as possible with realistic animation in order to learn how much to cut from it. This movie is INCREDIBLY detailed, but we wouldn't have gotten here without pushing as much ""realism"" (life-like motions, life-like details, life-like physics, etc.) without learning which of it to take away.&&Video games have this same problem imo. Back in the day, video games couldn’t look, realistic, so they didn’t try to, and because of it they had unique and catchy art styles. Nowadays, everyone is going for photorealistic, and the games that stand out to me are the ones that don’t try to imitate life but instead use the medium to their advantage. &&My brother is one of the people making it look the way it does, and I couldn't be more proud of him!!

Edit boogaloo: Oh, and he's on here too. Paging /u/theOKartist&&This probably has a considerably larger budget. Notice how Guilty Gear does something similar but it’s extremely labor intensive to get the beautiful final product we see.&&There's a reason the two of them are often put together.&&The above is true, but his design is also riffing of of [DC's Deathstroke](https://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/deathstroke-vs-soldiers-of-the-regime-injustice-gods-among-us-5.png) as Deadpool is basically satirical rip off Slade Wilson, hence Deadpools name being Wade Wilson.&&It should translate pretty well, as in the comics the spaces between threads are often shown as windows/doors to different universes. And it's physically in a place so they don't have to do any weird ""floating through the portal"" stuff. Just show the blue portal being open and then entering, then exiting through another blue portal. Or if they want to fluff it up have them walk to another section of the web and jump in.&&Silver and Black just got removed from Sony's schedule thank god

A Morbius solo is an awful idea&&Wow, that's a lot.&&I think you and I may define continuity a little differently. *Logan* and both *Deadpool* movies used characters, actors, and details from the other X-Men movies as they felt was necessary, but they didn't make any effort to make their stories ""fit"" into any larger continuity. All the movies are pulling from the same toolbox, but I think the franchise is past the point of pretending all the films are canon to each other. &&yeah, I also don't think she'd be covered under Sony's use since this one is more segregated from the rest of Marvel Cinematic. Makes me think that they can probably only use spider-assetts.&&I think it was that there was a month where a bunch of alternate covers were Gwen Stacy themed and for Deadpool they made a joke about combining two popular things, which resulted in Gwenpool

It gave it a pulpy look, like in the old comics when the coloring didn't quite match the ink lines, you know?

I'm freaking out. Sorry.  That was good.&&I could see it being valid in both cases; purely aesthetics to bring the comic book style into motion, but also to hint or emphasize important events.

The problem is that Lucasfilm is too restrictive in what they want their movies to be like, but I'm sure KK and the others were looking at those box office returns and swallowing their tongue about production until it was far too late.

**EDIT:** I think it's also fair to point out that none of the producers on Solo ever produced a comedy before, and all have seen to be attached to big budget blockbusters prior with more serious tones (Hunger Games, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, etc) so I think on that level, it was the wrong team for the project.&&Now dig on this!&&Excuse me?&&Venom is also written by the person that wrote the film adaptation for Fifty Shades of Grey

Oscar Isaac as Gomez, Charlize Theron as Morticia, Chloe Grace Moretz as Wednesday, Finn Wolfhard as Pugsley, Nick Kroll as Uncle Fester, and Bette Midler as Grandmama.&&[A drawing of The Addams Family by Charles Addams, the creator](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a1ece0212abd9cbfe3cf575/t/5a2eca2f53450a2864aa3bc7/1513015856160/533f12_10612cc2c4324ffc8be18b28c35d010c.jpg?format=1000w)


Everyone looks pretty damn spot on. I actually didn't know this was going to be a thing, or maybe I did and it slipped my mind? The last I remember is Tim Burton was going to tackle it in stop motion and that just fizzled. 

I'm hoping we get a fantastic adaptation because I fucking love The Addams Family.&&I don't why but this reminds me of the Courage the cowardly dog episode in which some spirit was there after a stone or whatever.&&Props to them for creating a Wednesday that most of the weird internet people won't want to bone.&&I own, I think, every book of cartoons Addams ever published, and a few singles (such as Commercial Art for advertising) that were never included in collections. Growing up as a kid in the 50s in New York, the New Yorker magazine was a constant friend in our home and I looked forward to every new Addams cartoon. A brilliant biography of his life had the interesting revelation that he didn't think up many of the gags that he drew, but was one of a stable of cartoonists and artists who worked for the New Yorker. That did not diminish my love of his work one whit.

This looks like it could be a lot of fun, and just from the style, I think Addams himself would approve.&&I had no idea this was happening. Colour me interested. &&Why is no one asking the important question: where tf is cousin it?&&If they are going to do a new Addams family, I'm kinda glad they are going animated. I don't think I could bring myself to see an Addams Family live action movie without Raul Julia.&&...I can't wait to see that animated because it looks like it's going to be strange as hell. &&Well, they're creepy and they're kooky. &&I dig it. I've loved The Addams Family (the old TV show, the first two movies, the animated series, even the terrible live-action Canadian series) since I was a kid so I'm looking forward to see what they do with this. &&There better be a really great dance number with Gomez and Morticia. Their relationship is one of my favorite things about the Adams Family. The love is creepy but it's everywhere.&&I actually like this, it is off-beat and strange and kinda ugly looking, which I think is a good use of the medium. It would have been dull had they made an animated movie but tried to make it more real-life looking, because then they might as well have made a live-action version instead.... but this look good, I'm intrigued. &&Okay but the real question is: Does this mean we can expect to see a Fester's Quest HD Remaster in the near future?&&[deleted]&&I'm not crazy about the style (and Fester looks too much like Gru) but an animated Addams Family actually makes some sense to me. 

I really liked the movies when I was a kid, and that was already a remake of something else, so I can't really complain about the remake. It's a different take.&&I miss Raul Julia&&for everybody complaining about the character designs, especially Fat Gomez, this is what the characters looked like in the original Charles Addams cartoons long before the TV show.  &&Where’s pubert&&What no pubert?&&Morticia looks like Jessica Rabbit with a severe eating disorder.&&No cousin IT, no thank you.&&Why is Gomez fat now? &&Not too keen on Nick Kroll as Fester on first impression, but I’ll wait until I hear him before I judge&&Why is half the family Gru?&&Wednesday looks *bad*.
Like I don't know exactly why but it reminds me too much of those wacky tictacs &&In awe at the sheer size of that lad.

Absolute Unit&&Why do I get the feeling that pugsley is going to be turned into a trouble making kid?&&Ummmmm, no thanks&&I am not a huge fan of that animation style... Every character looks like they are made up of a series of circles and ovals.&&Obvously none of you have ever seen the orginal comic, from before any movies or even the 60's Tv show.   These are what The Addams Family look like.  &&Eh i dont like this. Id prefer a version made by the Coraline/Boxtrolls/ParaNorman guys.&&Why they gotta do my man Gomez like that?&&I don't recall who the fat old lady is.

And where is Cousin It?&&I dislike this style of drawing the proportions are horrible. Just looks so off.&&I know it's pretty faithful to the creator's original designs, but John Astin's portrayal is the one that rings true to me.  

Also, I'm not dissing Raul Julia's phenomenal performance in the slightest.&&I'm so ready for this &&Why is Gomez so fat?&&Not a fan of this art direction. Having said that it does remind me of the original cartoons.&&Man they really exaggerate the how slim and thick everyone is, kinda off putting.&&First thing I think of when I hear [Addams family Animated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JehXwqCInlA)&&Woah. The cast for this film is impressive and the look is certainly captured well from Charles Addam's designs.

That makes me biased, I admit. Just personal opinion.

Gomez, take those out of his mouth.
&&It's like Q-Bert, you know?&&The funniest thing about the whole ordeal was Gavin was right, there was that movie back in the 90s where Mortitia and Gomez had another child. &&""They say a man who represents himself has a fool for a client.

This Gomez is so huge they could fit like four Raul Julias within his girth.&&I was 8 years old when my dad, who is a piece of human garbage, did something decent and brought me to see Julia in Man of La Mancha on stage at the Pantages in Los Angeles.  I don't remember any of it, but I remember him talking about how Julia was his favorite actor and driving up to the theater in LA.  One of the few memories I have of my father that aren't terrible, and I can credit Julia for it&&I have SEEEEeeen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark rrrrrrecesses of human SOOOuuuul! &&R.I.P&&Oscar Isaac could probably portray a live action Gomez too haha. &&I dunno why I suddenly can't picture anyone else playing Fester...&&And Allison Janney as the villain, Margaux Needler.&&>Charlize Theron as Morticia

Damn I wish this was live action now. &&>Bette Midler as Grandmama

Makes me nostalgic for Hocus Pocus&&I see they've also got Master Hand from Smash Bros as Thing.&&Maybe it’s just my slight dislike of Chloe Moretz, but am I the only one who thinks someone else should be cast as Wednesday? All I can think about is her role as Carolyn in Dark Shadows (a sort of dark role??) and I’m not feeling it. 

I fucking love Wednesday and the Addamses so I have such high expectations lol&&Higher budgeted than I imagined.&&Who's the voice of Cousin It&&Who knew Gomez was such a good pilot? 
&&I cannot think of anyone better than Midler for Grandmama. The rest sound like good fits too, especially Morticia (though that may be just my bias in favor of both Charlize Theron *and* Mortica)&&90s Tim Burton would have made a fantastic version. I'm kind of glad he's not involved anymore however &&yeah at first i was bummed that Gomez isn't handsome af like he was in the movies until i saw this photo, thanks! I'm glad they're going with what the Creator would have liked. &&I think they've exaggerated everything too much, so something just looks strangely off about the whole image.

In the author's pictures Gomez and Morticia seem to at least be drawn with vaguely human [proportions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Addams_Family.jpg). Gomez is now practically a balloon, and it looks like Morticia has been rendered with the wrong scaling.  Pugsley has gone from being slightly pudgy to so morbidly obese his belly is literally hanging out.  Grandmama has turned from a slightly kooky looking old lady to a caricature witch who is as wide as she is tall.  

I know exaggeration is needed for animation, but the original drawings were *already* exaggerated.  Knowing when to stop is a real skill, and I think here they've missed that point.  

The different characters have been pushed to such extremes that they almost look like they were designed seperately from each other.  Even their eyeballs look like they've been stolen from entirely different films -  Wednesday is practically a Minion.

It doesn't feel like they inhabit the same world as each other to me, and actually makes it look like a very cheap TV movie.&&The original style is ugly imo. Just because its the original style doesnt mean its the best. Look at the original simpsons. &&I know Gomez and Fester are brothers, but I never imagined Gomez so... rotund.&&RETURN THE SLAAAAB&&For those of you unfamiliar (and because I didn't see it posted yet), enjoy being terrified by a children's cartoon to the point that you remember it vividly nearly (holy crap) 18 years after it aired:

http://courage.wikia.com/wiki/King_of_Flan&&I honestly had nightmares as a kid from this episode. I'm 26 and it still creeps me out, though that could just be the memory of what i think i saw when i was a child. Probably not as scary as to what's in my head if i were to find a picture.

Yay!!&&Probably saving the whole family for the trailer&&Idk why I had to scroll so far to find this question lol?! &&My question is why the fuck is Gomez so fat?&&One could only hope&&Mysterious and spooky. &&I just bought the TV show on DVD and have been rewatching it. 

Surprisingly it's not great for binge-watching. Watching episodes back-to-back, you really notice how similar the plots are from one episode to the next. Every episode so far has been 'a stranger shows up to the house and is freaked out by how weird the Addams are.'

And they repeat the same jokes and gags more often than I noticed as a kid. I think I've watched six episodes so far and Fester has repeated the lightbulb gag three or four times already. The most egregious example was when Pugsley goes to collect his money out of his live piggy bank, and they actually reused the exact same footage of him chasing the pig in two different episodes.

But I'm having a blast even in spite of all this,  because I just adore all these characters.&&Agreed. If you're going to make an animated adaptation of something, you better do something interesting with the medium. Otherwise it's kind of pointless.&&My pet theory is that Sunsoft had a completely unrelated alien invasion game mostly done when they gained the rights to make an Addams Family game. Rather than start from scratch, they bolted Addams Family characters onto the other game in the hopes it would sell better.&&We do. &&The styles pretty true to Charles Addams original drawings. I kind of dig it. &&I think the 90s movies were pretty great, personally.  We could use more of them.  I mean, the first movie had one of the best renditions of Shakespeare I've ever seen:

This is fine, too.&&That said... I'm always a little wary when regular actors are cast in voice roles. Frequently, they don't know how to act with just their voices, and it leads to uninspiring reads. It's a different skill set than just regular acting. 

Although not too worried about Kroll or Midler. &&Christopher Lloyd was great though&&Maybe they'll get John Mulaney to be Cousin Itt or something, just so he and Kroll can have a scene together.

(The ur-example of this trope is Roald Dahl's ""Man from the South."") Peter Lorre spent most of his career playing variations on this type.

Note the way most cartoons of Gomez have large, crooked teeth with a buck-toothed gap? This implies a lisp, the stereotypical verbal tic of Castilian Spain.&&Funny that was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and I barely remember anything from it :(&&\*Grandma*ma*.&&Didnt that Ryan guy adopt him?&&That’s from 5 years ago!? Fuck me. I feel old.&&A little sidetrack here but I just had to rewatch [that scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVzAMmpMra8) after reading your post. Somehow I never realized until now that the actress who played Chun-Li (Ming-Na Wen) also voiced Mulan and now I can't unhear it.&&One of the greatest hammiest lines of all time delivered perfectly.

The man was a treasure&&That's a fun call-back to the original John Astin series, in which Gomez is the world's worst lawyer, has never won a case, but has the money to prop up his firm anyway and does it just for fun. Much like the toy trains (which in the movie are full of real people), he just enjoys the chaos of watching things fall apart.&&The entire movie was perfectly cast. I watched both of em about two months ago. Genuinely so many good laughs, each character was perfect, and i’m not even a massive Addams Famiy fan.&&I also really like Adams Family Values more than the first one. The final scene at Camp Chippewa when they wreck the play was awesome. Plus Joan Cusack was great and pretty sexy too.&&Oh, totally! She was perfect. &&Spot on!&&Don't torture yourself gomez, that's my job&&Anjelica Huston was also a great cast, but she's also still among the living.&&And christine Ricci as Wednesday was pretty great&&Still waiting for a grown up Wednesday and pugsley addams spin off &&Christopher Lloyd springs to mind as a stand-out as well.&&She was born for that role.&&She was dead on the insides when they cast her so she was perfect too&&""Really, I just can't tell, does he like me at all?""

Debbie: Give me a twenty! &&Wednesday was always my favourite.

I'm beginning to think he's masochistic.. &&absolute unit&&Thats what I thought too.&&Almost all cartoon men aren't nearly as hot as their wives. &&They're better animated, if you ask me.&&Bette Midler is a stage actress. I've heard that stage actors often translate well into voice acting because of the techniques you have to use to convey emotion on-stage (the kind of melodramatic and mildly to extremely exaggerated intonations). 

If you look into the extras of the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoons, there's some good voice acting stuff. Also there's the ""I Know That Voice"" voice acting documentary that's super interesting.  &&Check out Oscar Isaac in Inside Lellwyn Davis 

The guy can act with his voice; his singing is amazing &&Almost all of the main cast has at least some experience with it.

Isaac has only done a little voice acting for a Star Wars cartoon and video game. But, he's a Julliard graduate, so I'd expect him to have the kind of expressive training that you'd see with stage actors. 

Theron has done some voice acting in movies before (Kubo of the Two Strings and Astroboy).

Moretz has done quite a bit of voice acting before.

Wolfhard is new at this.

Kroll is obviously going to be fine.

Midler is going to be *amazing*.&&He naied that role&&He IS Fester to me. Such a great choice when it was made. Not a huge fan of Nick Kroll but I’ll give it a go and see what he can do. I just hope it’s a Character he comes up with and not Kroll doing The Douche (a la parks and rec). I hope it’s as much a surprise performance as something akin to Heath Ledger as The Joker. Fingers crossed... &&And we already know that Mulaney loves the Addams Family.&&i was just at clusterfest over the weekend. what else is kroll and mulaney known for?&&Ohhhhhh hello!&&I've been wanting to see him as Gomez since Sucker Punch&&Now we would get Johnny Depp as Uncle Fester&&Frankenweenie definitely muddled a bit in the plot department, but I loved how pro-science the whole thing was. Particularly that exchange at the end when the teacher gave what I feel is some of the best advice about the role of love in science I’ve heard yet in a movie.&&Well Frankenweenie was his throwback to his original style though...

Could have been pretty good &&Might as well change it anyways. No fit, handsome Gomez is ever gonna compete with Raul Julia. &&Not just the movies, the old shows and cartoons all portrayed him as a damn near perfect specimen of a human(?) male.

There was even an episode of a cartoon where he set out on a quest to fail at something while giving it his all, anything would do, since he was bored of a life of complete successes.  He then shoots himself out of a cannon while knitting a sweater, but he succeeded in than, too.  Ultimately, he fails to fail: achieving his goal in a roundabout manner.

[Found it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_9zGlLR3kI)&&My first thoughts exactly&&I think everyone else is a good artistic interpretation, but Wednesday just looks bad. It’s not really true to the original like the top comment is implying but looks like a good design for a new movie.

Julia did a great job, though.&&Very interesting, thanks.&&Peter Lorre was an excellent actor who (fortunately/unfortunately) got typecast as the creeper type. But he was such an incredibly, gifted actor in the few non-creepy roles he was able to get (not including Mr. Moto).&&Only thing I can remember is one episode where Gomez kept succeeding and not failing and was down and Morticia told him he failed at failing so he was good.&&I think so, Pubert spore Haywood&&Yeah, 312 was a week or two ago, which is 6 years.&&[deleted]&&I agree!  My only real complaint was that they decided to use Fester as the center of the plot for both movies.  Didn't really hurt anything but seemed odd&&I watch them both periodically. They're so damn good!

Don't forget Joan Cusack as Debbie. She was amazing in that role.&&Both Adams family movies and both Brady bunch movies were fucking gold. &&Dirty pool old man!&&The gods of my tribe have spoken.

EDIT: Also, I could have sworn she had done some voice work before. IMDB isn't showing any. Huh.&&That's still acting with other parts of your body. That someone can sing... let's put it this way, you ever see the Simpsons episode with Lady Gaga? No doubt, she can sing. Her VO, on the other hand... eh. 

Honestly, a better appraisal of this would be his Star Wars video games. Which I haven't played, so I have no idea. None of this is saying he can't do a good VO performance, just I personally haven't heard it. &&Hi um...do you have Addams Family Values&&I see Mulaney more as the ""normal"" guy who has to interact with the Addams Family. &&Oh Hello!&&Big Mouth, netflix cartoon.&&Oh Hello on Broadway&&Burton is too in love with Depp to have him as Fester.

The sequel is easily better. &&Yeah, both movies were legendary, but as a kid I liked the second one better.&&Even though the sequel has the Thanksgiving play and ~~Raul Julia's~~Gomez's speech at the police station, I actually prefer the original. The sequel relied on one too many sex jokes like a lot of 90s comedy sequels did.

**THE MAN IN GAUZE**&&Oh yeah, he definitely traded his bag-o-fucks-to-give for a decently large set of steel ballz.&&It's the same in the US. &&""Loli"" comes from ""Lolicon"" which comes from ""Lolita Complex"" which comes from the book *Lolita* in which a pedophile twists his story of rape and abuse of a child named Lolita into making it seem like he seduced her.

In any language, lolicon means pedophile and loli is another word for 'prepubescent girl'.

A nuance you *didn't* get, is that pedophilia is somewhat more normalized in Japan to the point that being called a lolicon/pedophile there is only a little bit worse than being called a disgusting pervert.&&Shit, I just like women with smaller boobs.&&[deleted]&&Yep. thank god for b&w.&&There were about 10 years between those two year, and he had been prolific even as a Hungarian refugee moving from Berlin then to London then to Hollywood. He had many significant roles in that time that were definitely straight. Perhaps he was one of the few not to be afraid to do ""Dangerous"" roles whether as serial killers, murderers, gay men, etc, but he also did heroic roles like Mr. Moto (a Hungarian Jewish man playing a Japanese detective), the tragic lead in Crime and Punishment- even Ugarte is a ""hero"" character who gave his life (sort of) in trying to help Victor Lazlo get his transit papers to leave Casablanca.

He wasn't typecast as ""gay"" by any means, but he was typecast as someone who could do acting roles ""outside"" the mainstream, which included coded gay characters at times.&&Wasn’t he part of QR?&&Does he have a buttfor?&&Please.

It wasn't an install, but he's now just a parody of the fantastic actor he once was.&&From what I’ve heard he and Helena are still on really good terms, so I don’t think their divorce will affect anything that much in terms of how often she’ll be in his films. 

Also even if she is “shoe horned” in to his movies, she always gives a great performance. I’m always happy to see her. &&I was ambivalent about his casting right up until I saw Grindelwald in the first Fantastic Beasts film. Whoever decided on that character design should be kicked in the teeth. They absolutely ‘Depp-ified’ the character. He looked like Jack fucking Frost got high and turned into Hitler’s crazy albino cousin. The entire point of his character was that he was an ordinary (if talented) guy with fucked up beliefs. Do they really expect us to believe that Dumbledore was in love with icicles McGee? That he couldn’t take one look at that fucker and go ‘oh yeah he’s a super villain guess I should step in here’?! &&Just putting this out there: Del Toro as Gomez, devito as fester, and depp as cousin it and thing. &&Giggly Johnny Depp wearing a fatsuit and insane face makeup&&I don't think Depp can do Gomez. Part of of Depp's charm is that he's frenetic and always has an undercurrent of being out of control. Part of Gomez's charm (at least in the movie version) is that he toggles between understated aristocratic charm without a hint of affect and a a frenetic surge that always has an undercurrent of being absolutely in control.

Tim Burton’s got pretty great taste in women&&I think his Captn Jack role was fine... It was every other iteration afterwards, in an attempt to have an awkwardly funny character forced in all his movies that messed it all up. &&Made all the worse because Colin Farrell was scary as fuck.&&To be fair, Dumbles didn't exactly develop a real moral code until he, Grindlewald, and Aberforth accidentally killed Arianna. Up until then he was totally on board the Subjugating Muggles for the Greater Good Express.

http://www.whitstablemuseum.org/peter-cushing/&&Holy crap this is amazing, Peter Cushing was amazing in Hammer Productions such as The Hounds of Baskerville, The Horror of Dracula around that era, how times have changed, pen pals is not something you would see today!&&My Dad too - Peter Cushing was a Napoleonic war enthusiast. My dad writes books about that shit. He is 84.&&Sure. “Pen pals.”&&For some reason the fact that Peter Cushing would have a penpal sounds completely plausible&&A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one&&“...I am pleased to write to you to tell you that the Death Star will be fully operational...”&&You want a pen pal, a military pen pal? Then name the address!&&Thought that was Goebbels for a sec and expected a very different thread&&The REAL 2nd Doctor... I don't care what the BBC says.

Although I suppose existing as an Earth movie adaptation of the Gallifreyan Time Lord in the canonical sense is better than pretending it never happened.

edit: titles are capitalized&&Any Death Star blueprints?&&Did you recognize his stench once you step aboard the station?&&Parents are weird.

Apparently, my mom knew a (now famous) musician when she was growing up. He had a crush on her. He was too young for her tastes and she found him annoying.

Said they are friends but haven't spoken in a while. 

&&I’ve legitimately never seen him not in his role as Tarkin where he looked rather... skeletal. 

Didn’t know that he was quite a handsome guy. &&R.I.P to your dad&&We stand here amidst MY ACHIEVEMENT! Not yours! Jk my family is boring. &&Anything from John Cheever?&&I heard that it was common for Cushing to respond positively and directly to fan mail after Star Wars. &&Surprised you didn't recognize his foul stench the minute you stepped in the attic. &&The Peter Cushing Facebook page would lose their shit over that.&&Well you know what you’re bringing to the antique roadshow if they come into town. 
Very cool story&&This looks like a  ps2 Medal of Honor menu screen &&Shame all I ever found in old briefcases my dad left behind was porn… &&[deleted]&&I hear he lives in Whitstable.&&That’s cool. I live in Whitstable in Kent UK. Peter Cushing lived here (80s/90s) on the beach for a while (the house has a blue plaque). There’s a museum in the town that might be interested in exhibiting these items if you’d like to share them?&&Peter Cushing was putting his Peter in your mom's cushing&&That is really something. Has she seen the SW films?&&He was trying to recruit her for the Empire. &&**Sir** Peter Cushing?&&Mr. Cushing was a superb horror film actor one of the classier type.&&Wicked find OP!

&&A classic. Cushing also played Victor Frankenstein (again with Lee as the monster). By far one of my favorite Hammer actors.

Edit: He was also in the Hammer version of The Mummy, again with Lee as the monster&&He was also Doctor Who (the movie version).&&He and Christopher Lee used to go to the cinema to watch cartoons.

You can read it here : http://m.ign.com/articles/2017/12/22/opinion-why-the-childish-general-hux-is-the-perfect-face-of-the-first-order

TL;DR The first order has many flaws, neither the experience nor the manpower nor the iron will of the empire, thus their incompetence is not a mistake on Disney's side but merely to highlight their anti-theticness to the empire. &&They did ask for a head shot.&&Finally, having pen15 written on my arm in the 3rd grade pays off! &&Hello, future people!&&OP's granddaughter, 25 years from today, will travel back in time to fulfill this *karmic* destiny.&&[A website grows great when old redditors plant karma whose points they know they shall never reap. ](https://www.escapade.co.uk/images/rotate/20424M/20424M-800-1.jpg?d=3)&&What do you think CC stands for?&&My basement&&The bigger the Cushing, the sweeter the pushing. &&In the latest Day of the Doctor  novelisation, they’re said to be movies within the Whoniverse, and that the Doctor would constantly be calling Cushing trying to pitch to him a threequel (which would be the adaptation of The Chase which was never finished).

My head-canon for that is that they were pitched by Ian and Barbara when they got back to L O N D O N N I N E T E E N S I  X T Y F I V E, seeing as the first one started life in London, 1965. &&*keeps digging*&&*Downstairs neighbors very startled.*&&Just for fun I tried this tonight.

&&Sorry I prefer MC.&&I love some Hammer Horror.

Probably my favourite film with Guinness&&He also did comedies, 'The Ladykillers' is my favourite.&&2nd best thing in the prequels after Ewan.&&Exactly.&&That's a compelling idea and could very well be true, but what we're presented on screen is, I think, too superficial to communicate any of that.&&I feel like they building the ""death star 3 (now even bigger!!!)"" Was a bit of a mistake in conveying this feeling. 
A bunch of idiots with the technical knowledge to build something like that is a bit of a stretch. Nothing unbelievable, but doesn't help imo.
Also, in my opinion, it opens so many plot holes but this is for another time.

Edit: I'm going to add that if there is a giant bureaucratic and military organization such as the empire, it doesn't simply vanish with all its heads just to be picked up by random kids.
If they inherited the weapons, they inherited the generals (no, they weren't all on the death star: you need a fucking lot of them, and even if they were there are other officials of pretty high rank able to coagulate some military force ancient Roman style)
There were only two way of making it work: 
In the first case you have one or more ex-empire factions, each lead by a different general with strong hand and great military forces and technology, plus the rebels aggregated around what's left of the senate, trying to rebuild the republic. 
In the second you actually have a devastated empire: the ex generals trying to keep together an empire that won't obey no more. The senate gaining indipendence but having to deal military against the leftovers of the empire, and diplomatically with the many local administrations emerged after the fall of the empire. 
There's just no place for empire fanboys building death machines: it almost as unbelievable as blocking lasers with the force. Oh, wait...

Brendan Fraser Says Golden Globes Organization Admits Member 'Inappropriately Touched' Him in 2003,42889,8p2vp1,https://www.thewrap.com/brendan-fraser-says-golden-globes-organization-admits-member-inappropriately-touched-him-in-2003/,2023,1528308325.0,,"[deleted]&&> The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the body responsible for putting on the Golden Globe Awards, has finished its internal investigation into claims made by actor Brendan Fraser that former HFPA President Philip Berk sexually assaulted him in 2003, the actor told GQ.
> 
> Fraser said the HFPA had concluded its investigation and found that Berk did in fact assault him, but the organization said it was meant to be taken in jest.
> 
> In that article Fraser said: “His left hand reaches around, grabs my a- cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.” When he was finally able to remove Berk’s hand, he added, “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.”

""in jest"". What a joke.&&Look everyone, sexual assault is perfectly acceptable as long as you say you're only joking.&&Awful things aside, I know he's currently in that ""Trust"" show, but I need more Brendan Fraser in my life.  Can this dude please be cast in some movies?  Miss 'em.&&I’d love for Brendan to get back in shape and continue with The Mummy series. That’s a series that doesn’t need to end. &&At some point movies are now going to need the disclaimer “no people were sexually harassed on set during the making of this film”

&&Wes Anderson needs to put Brendan in a movie. #bringbackbrendan&&This poor guy has lived 15 fucking years knowing that no one cared about this. He fucking told people and was told it was a joke. Dudes, imagine a dude, who can tank your career, suddenly rubbing your taint. I care, Brendan. Someone get this man a Marvel role. &&r/SaveBrendan&&There is nobody in Hollywood more deserving of a comeback than Fraser. His role in the Mummy movies was superb, the way the industry turned its back on him because he was abused was downright REPUGNANT.

This man deserves justice.&&Hoping this picks up steam online with support from other celebrities and press outlets. &&It feels strange when you find out one of the faces behind a childhood hero of yours is sexually assaulted.&&It makes me fucking livid that sexual harassment is so often played off as a""joke"" or in ""jest."" How an action was intended to be received has no bearing on how the action was actually received, particularly if it is sexual in nature. In high school, a group of girls would go around shoving water bottles in between peoples' butt cheeks. They thought it was hysterical, and did it amongst their friends, but I didn't know them very well, and on a school trip once, in broad daylight, walking down the street, one of them violated me in exactly that way. Not only was it painful and embarrassing, it was public and humiliating and I had completely no warning. I was completely unprepared, I didn't even know she was behind me. To experience that, and then be laughed at by a large contingent of students in a public place... It fucked me up for a long while. I wanted to cry. I totally understand how Fraser must have felt. Livid, I tell you.&&If this destroys the Golden Globes I will be *sooooo* happy.

So many better awards out there, that mean more. Like the DGAs, Independent Spirit Awards, BAFTAs. Give them the glitz-treatment and replace this sham GG operation.&&I really like Brendan Fraser. I wish Hollywood would cast him more. Looks like he got a Raw Deal. &&Hasn't Hollywood screwed Brendan enough?

We must protect what is left of him. At all cost.&&What a piece of shit. Brendan Fraser is brave to come forward with this, and I hope seeing this asshole dragged through the mud brings him some peace or satisfaction. Not that anything can really undo assault.&&“In jest”? Right. Because it’s totally hi-larious when some rando grabs your ass and fingers your taint...&&Man that's the type of shit I would throw hands for immediately. Fuck bridges burnt, that's some gross shit he did to him and he deserves to get socked. If anything the publicity would be good for Fraser.

Media:Why did you punch him Brendan?

Brendan: He massaged my taint without permission. *Turns to the camera* Violence is never the answer, children. Unless they violate your taint. Then nothing is off the table. The Mummy Returns, in theaters now.&&So if I rob a bank a grab a quick 10 mil all I have to do is tell the judge it was all ‘in jest’ right?&&Isn't that like every assholes excuse for sexually assaulting someone and then getting called one it? ""It was just a joke!"" NO this is not ok.&&Fuck this timeline.&&#JusticeForBrendan&&Brendan comes across as one of the true Hollywood good guys. It truly upsets me what he has been through the last 15 years. He deserves nothing but the best. &&I miss him. He was awesome in The Mummy films. &&“We have always taken Brendan Fraser’s allegations very seriously–both when he originally spoke out in 2003 and now again 15 years later"" 
Clearly not seriously enough... if he feels attacked and doesn't see the joke in what Berk did to him, this should be taken much more seriously. What I'm seeing is a ridiculous double standard between male and female victims of sexual assault that has to go immediately. &&touching someone sexually against their will is not a joke. touching someone sexually against their will is not funny. touching someone sexually against their will is not okay.&&I’m a dude and this sort of happened to me. I was looking for an internship with my degree and had been trying for about s month when I met a guy to talk about one. He was a head chief in wildlife biology so I drove an hour to spend a day with him on the job to try to forge a connection and maybe get an internship. He did not talk to me all day and at the end said

Basically, if you have blonde hair, you touch your elbows together and your tits touch your elbows, I’ll give you an internship. 

I was blown away. Like he seriously creeps on girls and after the incident I asked around and legit all of his interns were hot blonds with big boobs. 

That changed my opinion about men in power. 
&&This is sad.  He really has been through a lot and most certainly didn't deserve this.  Not only that but this guy also made sure Brendan wasn't in any movies for a while.  
I really fail to see how what this guy did could be conceived as a joke.  I mean who does this?  Sexual predators that's who.   Just like Larry Nassar thought he could get away with it.  Makes me sick.
His mom died and he went through a bad divorce.  Multiple back surgeries.  Super intelligent guy though.  He does like to remain in peace though.&&Man does that make it tough to suspend reality, all the shit that has come out about HW is just fucked up.  I'm a tall handsome male and I've been groped by people at work (squeezing my arms and my legs like I'm a doll).  I never reported it, but if some dickbag grabbed my ass and rubbed my taint I'd not know how to handle that shit. &&That's when you punch the guy in the face.&&Truly, the JUSTed one&&I had a greasy red lobster manager play grab ass with me 2 times before I put a stop to it, at 16. 4.25 per hour too.&&Fraser pauses, and his eyes seem to well up, and for the first time in this litany of surgeries and loss, he seems like he might not want to continue. I ask if he needs a break.

“I'm okay,” he says. “I think I just need to let some arrows fly.”

He excuses himself as I ponder what this means. A few minutes go by. When he returns, it's with a leather quiver full of arrows strapped to his back. He steps out onto his porch. Outside, he lofts a bow, nocks an arrow. Down below on his lawn, maybe 75 yards away, is an archery target. He releases the arrow straight into the target's center. Bull's-eye. Then nocks a second arrow, and does it again.

Finally, he exhales. “I feel a lot better now,” he says. He hands me the bow: “Okay, now you try.”

...what a legend &&im just happy someone is paying attention to Brendan Frasier&&So that's why his career died... &&/r/Titlegore&&having handled my fair share of HR stuff.... 'it was a joke' is the number one excuse for poor behaviour...  a true indication.. they just don't get it!  Cause fundamentally, it is about how it was received, not intent. Thee joke is used to justify some pretty abhorrent behaviour.  - yeah, that's as boring as hell, but it's the workplace, not a social life... when the 2 mix... one can never assume the social situation..they need to assume workplace standards&&Man I feel bad for all the shit this guy has seemed to go through. Its no wonder he has seemed ""off"" in lots of the interviews and press I've seen over the years.&&Sexual harassment is never a joke.&&HeToo&&r/savebrendan&&ABOUT EFFING TIME &&Saddest part is that this story isn’t that new.&&Genuinely curious...in cases like this what do they investigate that proves the story right or wrong? Other than the guy admitting to it, how can they confirm it happened? &&""Hey just having some guy fun, chill. "" fuck that asshole.&&Was a awesome guy that was going places. I hate that things went to shit for him. &&JUST &&Finally. But, the real question is whether or not his career suffered because BF refused to play ball, and a)not accept the advances or b)started telling anyone who would listen?&&I feel so bad for this guy. But if you want to support him watch the FX show, ""Trust"". Particularly Episodes 2 and 10...they feature Brendan Fraser pretty much through the whole episode.&&I’ve always liked Brendan, and I’m super glad to see him back on his feet in TRUST. Hopefully he can continue to find roles &&r/titlegore&&I hope Brendan knows how beloved he is, to so many people around the world.  He's one of those Actors you kinda got a soft spot in your heart for.  I know I do.     It's right next to the spot where Christopher Reeves is.&&I hope the man finds peace some day.&&I recommend checking him out in the show Trust. The season just ended and his character was my favorite part of the show, he breaks the fourth wall and has several killer monologues. I really hope he gets the recognition he deserves for that performance. &&That’s really fucking sad poor guy &&No wonder he went from movie star to that guy in those old movies.  &&Philip Berk definitely looks like he would do such things... What's even more tragic that I've heard people calling  Brendan a crybaby now. I'm definitely supporting him. Such things shouldn't ever stay hidden. &&I work in Hollywood and it's a disgusting industry, I see inappropriate and creepy things all the time. The revelations about mainstream figures like Weinstein, and *Open Secret*, the Allison Mack case, etc all prove it. Anyone with any kind of authority like an agents/directors act as if they have some sort of actual legal authority and have actual legal powers. In reality they have as much power as a real estate agent. It's ridiculous.&&Glad to see sexual assault on dudes getting attention. It’s tough for people to wrap their head around the idea that guys can be victims, even if they are big and beefy. It’s all “laugh it off people want to bang you that’s a good thing!”


Glad he’s calling out sexual predators for what they are.&&Now I hope the rings in Hollywood get fully exposed too.&&Brendan Frazier looking like Eugene Mirman these days&&Well, that explains the blackball
&&Not Fraser, no one messes with Brendan!&&Golden Gropes&&I feel like they could have gone with a more dignified picture here. &&/r/savebrendan now has a new meaning. &&Look everyone, sexual assault is perfectly acceptable as long as you say you're only joking.
&&I’m here to say that while I love “The Mummy” and “Looney Tunes” (it was hilarious, shut up), he was the best in “Blast from the Past”. Amazing ensemble too. He needs a comeback. &&Brendan Fraser is the best. The people who actively tried to destroy his career can go F themselves.&&Poor dude. He seems super nice and I miss seeing him in movies. A mummy resurrection would be awesome!&&The older he gets the more he looks like Rodney Dangerfield.&&Encino Man was the shit!

“No wheezing the juice!!!”&&>We have always taken Brendan Fraser’s allegations very seriously–both when he originally spoke out in 2003 and now again 15 years later,” the HFPA statement read.

Sure, sure you did.&&Dude can’t catch a break.&&Brendan Frasier was one of my favorite actors growing up. Encino Man, George of the Jungle, Blast from the Past, etc. And from what I’ve seen of him off the screen the man just seems to be a very nice and humble person. It’s really a shame you stopped seeing him in movies after a certain point. &&I think his mom died right before the interview/promotion. He still tries to be positive even though he has been utterly devastated. Doesnt help that his ex-wife leeches $900k/yr from him too. This man NEEDS to make a comeback!&&
> I love Fraser. He seems like a down to earth dude who really just wants to entertain people.

Need a ""down to earth star"" buddy film with Fraser and Keanu.  *That's* the sequel/reboot of Point Break I want to see.  Just the film to get Fraser back in George of the Jungle form&&Don't worry, it was one of the funny sexual assaults. That's fine, then. Let's all go home and have a good laugh.

Edit: a lot of people taking this comment as a defence of male on male sexual assault. It isn't. I foolishly assumed that the phrase ""funny sexual assault"" was so horrific that everyone would understand my intent to show how appalling the Hollywood exec's defence was. I guess the /s tag really is needed. My mistake. &&in jest

oh, we didn't realize it was just a prank bro. please continue&&Fuck dude. Hollywood sucks ass. 

EDIT: just so I don’t get more comments saying “wow man it doesn’t just happen in Hollywood” I realize this but we were talking about Hollywood so fuck Hollywood but more appropriately Fuck anyone who thinks its ok to sexually assault someone or anyone who sexually assaults anyone. 

EDIT: some people took offense thinking I was saying “Fuck Hollywood” to the people that are actually doing good and trying to change all the shit going on. Not my intention I’m purely talking about the bad side of Hollywood. &&> In GQ’s February article Fraser said: “His left hand reaches around, grabs my a- cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.” When he was finally able to remove Berk’s hand, he added, “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.”

That's awful, and literally the only person you can trust to give you the accurate LEVEL of how creepy and fucked up the grope was is Fraser.  The difference between seeing this from afar and feeling it are too big to ""investigate"" anything other than how it felt to him. &&Proverbs 26:18-19

Like a maniac shooting
flaming arrows of death
is one who deceives their neighbor
and says, “I was only joking!”&&I don’t think it’s possible to touch someone’s taint “in jest” wtf&&Imagine how many other people Mr. Berk has sexually assaulted that don't have the audience of Mr. Fraser.   &&I didn't wake up this morning thinking that I'd read a quote from Brendan Fraser in which he references his taint.&&Weren't the Golden Globes the one who did the whole MeToo shit on stage? With Oprah and everyone?&&A quick slap on the ass, I can maybe see. That's too much. &&Stop touchi-

""Come on man, can't you take a joke?""&&“It’s a prank bro!”&&:(&&> Fraser said the HFPA had concluded its investigation and found that Berk did in fact assault him, but the organization said it was meant to be taken in jest.

Ah, so if a women were raped (as an example) it wouldn't be a big deal if it were intended *in jest*?&&What is up with dudes grabbing ass and getting a finger in there? Also who gives a shit if it was meant ""in jest?"" Since when does that have any bearing on what was done? If a man made that excuse it would get laughed at. &&In jest is comicly and dramatically grabbing each butt cheek. This was a molestation. &&And somewhere Kevin Spacey slaps his forehead.

""Fuck! I should've said 'Just kidding!'""&&And apologizing means you are automatically retroactively absolved of any wrong-doing. &&Just a prank bro&&I mean, there's a dangerous correlation between when this occurred according to Brendan's recollection and the almost complete removal from Hollywood. When considering he was cast for Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008) in 2003 and he was the face of the Mummy Franchise, almost all of his theatrical films with him in a starring role are self-produced after 2003.

It's not like his star power was waning, either.

Growing up Indiana Jones was a little before my time but the mummy was one I got to see in theaters and later bought the VHS. Fraiser was basically my Indiana Jones, a hero 9 year old me looked up to and wanted to be just like. I was always disappointed he never had any bigger breakout roles after that but he's always held that place in my heart of a personal hero and hearing that even he was sexually assaulted leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Child me is thinking ""Rick O'Connell wouldn't have taken that shit! Why didn't he lay that guy out!?"" but adult me knows that isn't how the world works and he's an actor and doing that would have ensured he gets black listed and doesn't work again. This might sound stupid but this one kind of hurts on a personal level, like it happened to a friend. &&You would not believe how many of your friends it has happened to.&&Might make some people (especially boys) less ashamed to come forwards.&&Wow.

HAHAHA IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO!!! LOOK AT THID CAMERA RIGHT HERE, ANS RIGHT THERE!!&&Terry Crews did an interview talking about exactly this mentality, and the problems with it.

&&Yeah, like when you think it's funny to punch someone in the face, but then when they come up with a broken nose they should just ignore the pain because you intended it to be a painless act, and clearly intentions are more important than physical damage.

The young naive star going to Hollywood only to end up having to sleep with a string of producers/directors in the hopes of getting a job is it's own trope in books/movies/TV shows and has been for a long time.

Brendan Fraser tried to speak out about this back then. He was blacklisted. Everyone knew, nobody talked about it. 

But for whatever reason the public finally started to side with the victims and give those who spoke out support, at which point the press realised that they could get a shitload of views by reporting on it and the whole thing snowballed.

The problem with Hollywood, and people in general, is they don't realize the hardest and most overlooked aspect of taking a moral stand is being firm and 100% commented to that moral stand no matter who you have cut from their lives.

Yeah and that's kind of hard to take seriously from the Director's Guild when it took about over six times for Scorsese to win, nothing for the likes of Kubrick or Hitchcock, and a clear bias toward actor-turned-directors.

Because this isn't just Hollywood.  Anyone who thinks this is a Hollywood problem is naive.  This is a societal problem.  It's only that, lately it's become sort of accepted to call out abusers and speak of abuse openly if you're wealthy or famous, so we actually hear about it now.  It's good to have more awareness but it's revealing how common people sexually assault.

I've recently seen him in an excellent TV series called ""Trust""; it tells the story of the Getty family and it's extraordinarily well made.

I don't know all the ins and outs of this system so if somebody can explain more, I'd be keen to hear it&&Prenup people, do a Prenup before marrying if there is a large income/wealth imbalance. It's less than 1k to do and all you do is go to a lawyer beforehand, list assets and income and jazz, and both parties sign agreeing that everything before marriage will remain theirs and theirs alone. &&Ulpt: marry someone with more money than you&&And absurd that a woman somehow earns a right to that income by basic virtue of having once been your wife. &&Really soft and expensive pillows.

He takes his dates out to eat with the spousal support I pay monthly. And yes, I do think he is a piece of shit. He hasn’t had a job in 17 years, and loves to tell people that he is “retired” at 45. I truly feel for the many, many men that get so casually screwed like this every day. &&We'd also be surprised how many of the men committing sexual assault on other men identify as heterosexual too.....but ""it's a joke"", right?&&As a lot of women have recently shown, there’s no way to be anonymous if you’re going to accuse someone of rape or assault. You have to stand up and be prepared for the onslaught of scrutiny, especially if you’re famous.
So the men who have been raped or assault need to stand up with the women and we all need to support each other and avoid a kind of ‘who had it worse’ dialogue. 

It is hard for men to admit these kinds of trauma because they feel like men are supposed to be the strong ones who can handle the tough stuff.
It is hard for women to admit these kinds of trauma because they know they will have every part of their life examined and will possibly have to prove that they aren’t actually responsible for it happening to them.

The point is, it’s hard no matter *who* you are. It’s traumatic, terrifying and humiliating to stand up and ask for justice but for the first time there is a real dialogue in the community about the abuse and victimisation of people in powerless situations, both men and women. So let’s keep it going together as brothers and sisters.&&I have a hunch many don’t consider themselves victims of sexual abuse. Either they buy into the myth that men can’t be sexually harassed or they refuse to see themselves as “victims”&&I also think a degree of education would help. I had a friend tell me about how he lost his virginity at 11 to a 21 year old. He told me how she talked him into it, he didn’t understand what was happening but ya know, he can at least brag about it now. I was the first person to hear the story who asked him how it made him feel, if it was something he wanted and has it ever bothered him? 

It was after those questions that he realized he had been raped. &&Jesus, Corey Feldman’s been trying to speak up about *child* actors being raped/assaulted for DECADES and couldn’t get anyone to really give a shit. &&Mostly, it was a dog bites man type of story, to predictable to report on... but sometimes people went after established stars who’d paid their dues and won their fans.  Those would have been man bites dog stories, generating enough surprise and interest to sell papers.

Edit: Article: [""Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein""](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/peter-jackson-harvey-weinstein-ashley-judd-mira-sorvino)

Peter Jackson confirmed that he had considered Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd for parts in Lord of the Rings, and Weinstein pressured him not to.&&And yet people trot out “how dare people not speak out at the time!!1!” to vilify people who come forward later on. Like hell, their careers are decimated when they speak up or say no even without public knowledge or anything else, but people wonder why people are so reluctant to fight back or go public? &&Someone finally needs to RICO their asses. This is a criminal enterprise facilitating rape under threat of destroying one’s career.&&I don’t think one could reasonably say that there is no possible way that someone MIGHT be blacklisted due to a single occurrence. &&Depends. Because roles can evaporate for two reasons- being blacklisted, or just not wanting to appear anymore. The former would happen in the situation you mentioned. The latter would also impact their career, because they would just audition to less roles, and put themselves in less situations of danger. It’d be the flight response as opposed to the fight response. &&There'd be an awful lot of [this](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).&&Damn dude, I'm sorry. Don't know if you're religious but I said a prayer for you. I hope you have a great life!&&Schwarzenegger confirmed for “Terminator 8: Get Termin8ed”&&Except Terry Crews was assaulted.&&They could do it Alan Quartermain style. Give Brendan grey hair and make him the old explorer coming out of retirement. Have him alongside someone like Liam Hemsworth. 

Basically like Quartermain and Sawyer in LoEG. &&Like National Treasure? Treasure hunt with ocassional collapsible rooms and a little running.&&Like... a stunt double?

Or that newfangled CGI software...?

Seems like there are plenty of alternatives.&&Also Cruise probably trains to an extent Fraser never did. I mean Cruise really did martial arts training, helicopter flight lessons, TONS of HALO jumps, etc. just for MI prep. 

When he does a stunt, he doesn't half ass it. (Not saying Fraser did, but it's possible he didn't prepare to the same extent.)&&I imagine savebrendan grew bigger and the mods found it redundant &&Jake Lloyd retired from acting because idiotic fans cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality.&&What was he accused of? What's the video?&&Holy fuck. I didn't find that first but you're right now that I looked deeper. And I read about the stuff towards Jake Loyd which was before my time. He was a ten year old kid! What the hell is wrong with people! This seriously makes me sad and ashamed as a fan :( I still stand by saying that sexism plays a big part because looking at their specific cases a vast majority of the comments are so strongly sexist towards Kelly and Daisy (amd you do see a LOT of similar things towards Kathleeb Kennedy and Laura Dern too), but as you pointed out it clearly isn't isolated to just that so I will admit I was wrong to jump the gun there.&&A few others have pointed out that it happened to Jake Loyd back when The Phantom Menace released too. It's fucked up to the highest degree that this has been happening for so long let alone AT ALL.

I think with how bigger internet and social media culture is that this sort of behaviour is becoming far more apparent to more people, as well as becoming more prevalent.&&Mike Jones&&I maintain that there are some actors who are just cast as themselves because they’re hilarious and amazing. Andy Samberg, is one - Charlie Day another..

(Edit: not to say that they can’t act, just that their own personalities shine through to influence the characters as well).&&And GG love him too because he brings them ratings.&&No, he said comedian&&http://www.itv.com/news/2012-05-19/will-smith-slaps-reporter/

&&Trust aired on FX:[Trust IMDB](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5664952/) &&Paying the losing sides bill is common, in the Anthony Cumia situation it was fucked up because he had no kids and he had to pay upon ""potential earnings"", money he was projected to earn if he became more popular. Welcome to equality. Dave Foley from 'kids in the hall' 's divorce is even worse... After his death, his estate had to still pay until his ex wife's death. He has not been back to Canada because of the threat of prison time, prison time in which he doesn't accumulate cash and therefore rolls over into more years in prison. Cool right guys.&&[deleted]&&Isn't it the case that prenups are not the final say on divorce results?

I say: just don't get married. Or have a non\-legally binding marriage. It's just not worth it.&&It's a relic from when women didn't really work and men supported the families. Like 70 years ago.&&I went to a predominantly male boarding school for high school. Pretty much standard behavior by bullies to do this shit. I remember 'prison rape' was a popular game my senior year. (Note: It wasn't actually the 'rape' part but they would definitely get all humpy and try to stick stuff up your ass) 

I remember when it was my 'turn' I sat there with a hockey stick ready to slash the first one that came through. Fortunately that was enough of a deterrent that time. &&Happened to me many many times&&I'm gay, and I got harassed by a male coworker was ""straight"" and coupled. I told my coworkers what was going on, but they were wishy\-washy about it. I didn't report it because there's this long history of characterizing gay men as predatory and I knew it would either be blamed on me, or people would say I was reading into it because I wanted him to be attracted to me.

I was hanging out with a counselor friend once and she told me she'd read and article that said the vast majority of sexual harassment complaints that are filed by men against other men are actually filed against ""straight"" men. Either repressing sexual attraction comes out in harmful ways, or this is just one of many ways men try to exert their superiority over other men by humiliating them.&&Have a friend who told of a locker room bully in middle school that would touch guys balls or finger their ass while they were changing and it was a good laugh. 

I’m just like “bray thas assault”&&Well it's not a joke it's abuse but those men are likely not repressed homosexuals. 

Such a view of sexuality is as antiquated as the homophobic views people seem to think they are fighting against when they assert that narrative.

Sexuality goes far beyond who we want to have sex with in the modern western social context. 

For all people but men especially sex is often conflated with power. And sexual violence is first and foremost about power.

Men and boys commit sexual violence to humiliate their victim and make themselves feel powerful.&&Feldman is a genuine guy I think and good person probably....BUT hes not doing himself any favors when it comes to publicity or public persona. I can see why some people take everything he says with a grain of salt.  Hes just so...different.  Its unfortunate but thats the World we live in.&&wasn't it because he kept withholding information for money? At least that's what I thought happened&&Goddamn Rolo Tumasi always getting away with this shit.&&What she said to Corey Feldman when he was talking about being molested as a child in Hollywood.

Edit u/ThoughtsYouIgnore corrected me, it was about Polanski, but she was VERY dismissive of Feldman, they all were. &&https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/29/roman-polanski-whoopi-goldberg

It was in reference to Polanski&&It amazes me how apparently *even other victims* still have this insane idea that men can't be assaulted. It baffles me. It's like telling a woman who was raped ""Well.. you've had sex before and you enjoyed it, so what's the big deal? It's no different right?"".

Reminds me of the ""fun fact"" where when Hugh Jackman was filming in Xmen: Days of Future Past, he was running around a series of corridors in full rage out mode. He was naked and had insisted on a closed set. He runs around a corner annnnnd what does he see? All the female cast cheering and whistling. He tried to instinctively cover himself up and cut himself with his prop claws.

And from that... nothing. Because it was 2013 and nobody cared about any of this, certainly not when it happened to male stars. &&Sounds like sorry not sorry to me.&&[deleted]&&Wtf&&She’s “sorry if anyone was offended” but not sorry she paid a prostitute to sexually assault her EMPLOYEE. 

WTF that woman should be brought up on sexual assault charges of some kind.  What if the tables were turned?  Disgusting.  And NO she is not “forgiven.”  To be eligible for forgiveness one must “repent” (that is, be remorseful) and want to repair the damage done.  &&What a cunt&&Yeah man, it hurt like hell writing CeeLo out of my music collection for his Twitter rape apologist bullshit, and I hope at least some Lovato fans make the same sacrifice in order to hit her in the pocketbook for this.&&Haha I’ll try not too! &&Not just assault, that sounds like rape &&Of course that's harassment! &&Yeah, you got raped dude. Your former boss is a fucking predator, and you should call her the fuck out on social media if it as been too long for you to take legal action.&&Damn, these days it makes sense to carry a digital recorder everywhere.&&Damn that sucks sorry that happened. 

People abusing power disgust me. &&That’s rape&&The general rule of thumb is: swap whatever role(s) is(are) in question and see if it becomes an unfair situation for one person or the other.  If you were the boss and she was the employee, it would have been harassment, even with you being 24 and her being 50.  Hell, even if you were the employee and she was the boss, you could threaten to quit if she didn't sleep with you.  Yes, she could fire you, but you've already sexually harrassed her.  


All sexual harrassment boils down to when one person explicitly or implicitly puts another person in the position to accept or deny some form of sexual interaction that either person feels it could have a negative or positive impact outside of the sex between two legally consenting individuals.  It can be two people who work together, live together, are friends, complete strangers, in a relationship, are married, are otherwise related, or anything else you can think of.&&That is extremely illegal. It’s sexual harassment and falls under the “quid pro quo” (sleep with me and you keep your job). 

I hope your no longer working there, but if you are, go get an attorney, ASAP. &&I see you've never been a roommate with an overly-cheery morning person.&&Another translation I've seen reads:  
> 14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, Arousing him early in the morning, It will be reckoned as a curse to him.  

I don't do ""something good"" in an inconvenient/disturbing way, like calling you early in the morning just to say hello and see how you are.

The following verse, for topical context:  

 > 15 A continual dripping on a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike;  
> 16 He who would restrain her restrains the wind, And grasps oil with his right hand.

Here is a similar one to the first. Proverbs 25:20:  

> New International Version  

> Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on a wound, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.&&I mean, it is different, but mostly because everything comes in degrees. Can't really argue that touching yourself in front of others in less bad than touching others. Both still pretty bad though, without consent.&&Pretty sure Asia Argento's career suffered after XXX. I have no source or timeline, but I really liked her.&&My favourite is the statement/ implication that when it happens again it's the first victim;s fault, rather than y'know, the guy who did it.&&Except there are bound to be a number of already very successful actors/actresses that knew about it yet stayed shut&&Brad Pitt confronted Weinstein in public in 1998 about Weinstein working on Gweneth Paltrow.  Paltrow's parents are both huge hollywood actors, so it is safe to assume that anyone working in Hollywood in the last twenty years knew Weinstein was fucking all these actresses.  Hollywood is going to try to spin this story that Weinstein is a monster etc, but they all knew and enabled how the game works for at least the last twenty years in regards to Weinstein.&&This is the first time I’ve seen RICO mentioned and honestly from my limited understanding of RICO this could actually work.

I fully admit I don’t know enough about the law but damn, what a take down that would be. 

&&you're double negative is confusing the hell outta me.&&[deleted]&&That would work. I would want to watch that movie&&They could also just, you know, use CGI and stunt doubles.&&Just make league 2 ffs.&&You also gotta realize that a dude who is 5'7"" and 150lbs (Cruise) is going to be able to do a lot more than a dude who is 6'3"" and closer to 200lbs (Fraser), give or take a baker's dozen for the role. 

When you have that much mass and you're throwing yourself around, you're gonna put a lot more stress on your body.&&[deleted]&&Grabbing a breast on TV. Google “Ben Affleck Hilario Burton” – I’m a car passenger and getting carsick from Reddit, haha.&&Honestly, kudos to you for keeping your mind open. Harassment comes in many forms, with many motivations. **ALL** of which are disgusting and dehumanizing.&&Adam Sandler is a prime example of this. He was literally cast as himself for Brooklyn Nine Nine.&&Well, they must not have loved him that much, since they replaced him with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.&&That's a hell of a cumback. &&Dave Foley is still alive for everyone else who panicked just now.&&> After his death, his estate had to still pay until his ex wife's death.

The Sisters kept at him - sometimes he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not.&&I rolled over in barracks once to see someone tea bagging a kid in the next bed over.

If you didn’t fit in with the guys or the culture funnily enough you were the one called a “faggot”. &&I was just about to add how male on male ritual hazing abuses are so often sexual/homoerotic in nature.

We need to start demanding real action and assuming anyone standing in the way is bought or has something to lose. How could anyone not support a few open and honest investigations at this point? How can anyone watch another major film and not contemplate everything the actresses (and actors) went through to get it? And we continue to fund that machine with all of these hanging questions floating around.&&If the media was halfway competent (and less intertwined), we would have heard that logical suggestion being demanded months ago. These are criminal enterprises and everyone who was aware of it and benefited from it (even it not getting out) is complicit. Also, you’d think Republicans would be falling all over themselves calling for congressional hearings on this perfect distraction (and to stick it to Hollywood-types that have stuck in their craw for decades) like they did before. Their silence is a little strange too, no? This situation couldn’t be better if it was wrapped with a bow.&&“It’s still possible for someone to be blacklisted from one single occurrence” :)&&Hah yeah sorry, looking back on it, it was confusing. It seems I didn’t proofread it. &&People that go all Roger Ebert on action flicks really suck the fun out of life. There are movies that are meant to be works of cinematic art, and then sometimes we just want to see badass explosions and fight scenes. Sadly most movies are judged on the same criteria regardless of genre. Is Michael Bay incapable of directing a gripping heartfelt story? No, but since when have those movies grossed $1billion? Exactly.&&That's also a really good point haha. Thanks!&&You don't think the abuse at an adolescent age might have had some part in that? &&You are absolutely spot on in your last two sentences.

In regards to both Daisy and Kelly's situations, sexism certainly is a factor in *how* trolls are harassing both of them, and I say that purely for their cases and not all cases. For others, like Brendan Fraser himself, there is many other reasons why these horrible people are harassing them all of which are horrible. In Brendan's case I would also say sexism is prevalent in the motivation and why his harasser felt he could get away with it. Which highlights just how many forms of harassment there are and how the motivations can differ so much. All of those reasons and incidents are important to discuss and to try and stop.&&Cop cop cop

I haven’t seen the clip in awhile, so maybe I’m misremembering but she was pointing out he wasn’t actually charged with rape?&&What gets me is that he wanted a closed set, literally meaning that unless you are key to that scene you aren't allowed to be there. It's not like he said ""yeah whatever I don't care who's there"" and some of the cast acted a bit unprofessional, they flat out ignored the rules for a closed set and then acted *wildly* unprofessional which resulted in an actor sustaining an injury, one which was nearly *extremely* serious. 

And.. that was it. I mean it's possible that there was hell to pay internally and we've never heard about it, I certainly hope so.&&Time to film sex scenes with female actresses and have all the male cast hoot and holler!&&[deleted]&&Yeah, but good fucking luck proving it, mate.

This is one circumstance where I feel a “yes this” comment is warranted, even though I believe rediquette dictates not to do that. &&I did say ""you're"" so we can't all be perfect haha&&Since Titanic?&&I think, unfortunately, the media and especially social media has made calling out harassment a ""team game"" based around the motivating factors, rather than calling out the *actual freaking harassment*.

*All* motives for harassment are terrible, but we as a society absolutely **cannot** lose focus of the fact that these victims are suffering and deserve our support and encouragement... regardless of the motivation.&&Were there other guys who stood up for you or said anything about how fucked up the bullies were being, specifically with it being homoerotic? &&Wonder how they even got on set?

Love those odds&&100 % agree. That's why I said all of those motivations and incidents are important and we need to discuss and stop it. Because while finding out why this is happening is important (so that hopefully others can learn from it, stop it in the future, amd simply spread awareness on the issues) the fact that it HAS happened to these humans is just as important, if not more so. Because they're people and they matter. I've been finding this entire thread quite heart breaking. To hear that Brendan went through something like that, and then hear what Kelly is going through now... I really feel for them. It's awful. Brendan must have felt so sick, and Kelly must have feel so alone.

EDIT: I just want to say I like your outlook on these matters. It's highly admirable and you should know that.&&Are you a male? No disrespecting just asking. Most of people in public highschools see this. There is no ""sticking up for the small guy"" people see it. They ignore it. And all of these new ""policies""? About ""stopping bullying""? They are bullshit. All that happens is the staff says ""you both did some wrongs"" (aka one kid was bullying the other and then the bullied kid reported it.) So they suspend both kids and after it's over the kid continues being bullied more vigourusly and the staff stop caring. Because they 'did their job'.

But lately for the last few years they have shown several films (off the top of my head, Gone Girl, The Martian, The Revenant and Logan, mostly Fox films) in their original aspect ratios. 

It was a real treat to revisit this movie this way almost a year after seeing it on the big screen.","Since they premiered it on HBO does this mean it is currently available on HBO Now? &&the film has not been modified from its original version and we dont give a fuck it doesn't fit your screen. \- HBO.&&They did?

https://youtu.be/5m1-pP1-5K8?t=47

The movie looses a lot more than just 30% or so of its visuals. Pan and scan completely changes the camera shots from their original intent, so some of the story and its emotion is lost.&&I'm happy to see the film being treated right. Everyone I've recommended it has really loved it, but all were hesitant to give it a chance at first without my urging. My favorite film last year along with Coco. &&I haven't watched a movie on broadcast in years, that's good news, hopefully they will be imitated in that regard.&&Still hopin' for HBO to show an extended version, a la The Godfather movies, incorporating scenes which were shot but not included in the theatrical cut.

Widescreen usually refers to 16:9, which is what your TV probably is. So if they'd shown Blade Runner in widescreen, they would have had to do some cropping.

Those films listed above are 2.39:1 \(or 2.37:1\) which is usually called Cinemascope.

Could be a regional thing though.&&I remember when Last of the Mohicans came out to rent on VHS.

If you don’t like the “black bars” you can change the setting on your tv to cut off the ends of the frame to fill the screen. If it’s aired cropped, there’s no way to revert it for people who want cinematic aspect ratio.&&Most modern TVs have different aspect modes built in, so if someone wants to use the “overscan” mode then fuck em, let them live in their own misery. &&Black bars matter&&Get yourself a new tv broke boy. - HBO.&&I have no issue with letterbox. :)&&Most flatscreens give you an option to change the aspect ratio if people want it to fill the screen. But the simpletons who want to actually watch it this way probably can't navigate their menus to do so anyway.&&They got a lof of shit for showing *Kong: Skull Island* as the airplane edit a few months ago.

Glad to hear they're making some changes.&&Yeah, normally I would be all about keeping the widescreen presentation. But since this movie actually had an Imax release with more visuals on top and bottom that are cropped for 2.40:1, we're just seeing black bars on our 16:9 TVs where we'd be seeing extra interesting stuff. So I am not sure it's so great.

(And I realize that the standard version was the director's wish, but still...)

&&Fuck I’m jealous I need to get a 4K tv&&[deleted]&&It should run in Imax forever, it feels like even the biggest sharpest TV can't do it justice&&Aaaaand the best you can get on HBO Now is 1080 SDR :\(&&Due to a bunch of things falling in line, I recently bought one of the LG OLED TVs. 

Will be here this week. I have so many movies I need to watch. This is one of them as I haven't seen it yet. Can not wait. &&[It is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKXovtElVxA).&&[deleted]&&Would I still enjoy it if I haven't seen the original? Thinking about watching it today&&Five times in IMAX.  
Would have went for infinity but it was only there for about two weeks. &&Same, except I watched it 5 times, lol.&&Same. Saw it with my Mom and and best mate on my birthday. Magical fucking movie. Just watched it last for the first time since then and I was still in awe of that damn movie. So good.&&I still dont get it? Why would HBO change the aspect radio to fit tube tvs from the late 00 in the year 2018 in the first place?  &&Damn unfortunately most of my friends found it boring so I don’t have anyone I know who appreciates it as much as I do&&Coco was my favorite film for sure, I was fortunate to see it an IMAX theater twice, just a really beautiful film. I intentionally saw BR 2049 on a Tuesday morning and there was only one other dude in the theater and he fell asleep and was snoring so damn loud it really fucked up the experience. Have yet to see it again, definitely will watch it soon. I enjoyed the movie but the snoring fucker at 10am really pissed all over my original experience &&Looking at you, FX.&&It's downright infuriating to watch a movie on cable channels, I avoid it at all costs.&&I thought he said that he wouldn't do it. That the movie that's out *is* the directors cut. &&Movies are made in editing, scenes are cut for a reason & if all scenes that were shot are added it could paint a completely different narrative or adversely effect the quality of the film.&&Yes! I would love a 5 hour version of Blade Runner&&It tears me up inside that movies like BR 2049 don't do that well in the box office in spite of being amazing on an artistic level. I see the lack of mainstream appeal but I wish this was overshadowed by how beautiful everything about the film is.&&Constant K! You can pick up your bonus...&&Absolutely. History will treat it as a marvel early 21st century filmmaking. The acting. The cinematography. The plot. The atmosphere. Everything about it was so brilliantly thought out.&&The movie came out last year. I really don't know what this statement means. &&Yeah, that 4k HDR disc is glorious. &&*3.4K, it was shot open gate on the alexa xt. But yes that HDR is glorious!&&It got cinematography I think&&Most likely an ad &&Clearly being assisted in some way,  whether that's HBO using a vote inflating service,  or them paying reddit  directly. 

There's no way a post like this would make it this far in its own. 

It's almost insulting.&&True, but it has Blade Runner 2049 in the title. The circlejerk had wound down over the last few months, I guess people were starting to get antsy.&&I dont think Widescreen refers to 16:9.  I think it refers to ""Not 4:3"".  Movies have been doing ""widescreen"" letterbox format for years even when the film is 16:9 or 2.39:1. 

That said, the film is in 2.39:1 on HBOGO.  &&Cinemascope is trademarked I believe. And I don’t think it’s been used for years. &&Widescreen is a blanket term for anything wider than 1.37:1.  I've never even heard the term Cinemascope used to refer to the aspect ratio, just as an old lens technology.&&It's OK. Not everyone is a film nerd&&/r/LifeProTips &&What do you mean by this?&&Nothing pisses me off more....like do they not understand video file formats at all??&&Better than my parents who change the aspect ratio to make it fit.&&Man I bought my dad a 4K Blu-Ray Player for Christmas to go with his 60+ inch 4K TV, popped in The Revenant, crystal clear you can see individual rain drops in the opening scene, and he still complained that there was black bars on the top and bottom.

edit: Getting a lot of weird replies to this. Reddit has some serious daddy issues.&&Many of my customers. Literally ran a service call last week because someone could see bars during commercials. When I get there she is watching msnbc, and they leave the ticker on during commercials and shrink the commercial to fit above the ticker. She insisted there was something I could do to fix it. &&I'm going through the movie collection to weed out crap we don't need. My wife had full screen Harry Potter sitting in there. I almost burned my entire collection for the fear it had spread. &&They think if you zoom in it's like CSI or something and the image magically enhances.&&Solution: buy larger TV&&So say we all.&&I don't understand this, most TVs are so big now a day that you get a pretty decent sized frame even if you get an ultrawide format on a 16:9 TV.  Does anyone who actually knows the difference actually prefer a pan and scan?&&Perfectly balanced&&All things in a balance&&Perfectly balanced &&perfectly balanced &&Perfectly balanced.&&Perfect balanced. &&Perfectly balanced. &&:-(&&Nah. Much better to watch it on pan and scan VHS where some production assistant decides what portion of the cropped scene you get to see.

Oh. And tracking.&&The kind of people who complain about letterboxing are also the kind of people who have no idea what any of those settings do (or where to find them).&&While I do agree that movies should be aired the way they were meant to be viewed, the aspect adjustment on TVs doesn't do exactly the same thing as a proper pan n scan. Pan n scan is sort of a re-edit of the film which chooses the best placement for the cropped area based on the content on screen. Adjusting the aspect ratio simply centers the image and cuts the edges at a fixed point regardless of content. That being said, some films are released in center cut which is exactly the same as the aspect adjustment. &&“Some people don’t take movies so seriously.  Fuck em”&&yeah and crop out all the good stuff.&&ALL bars matter, so I'm heading to one now.&&Except in gifs. &&That’s a shame. Kong SI had some really gorgeous cinematography. I was shocked when I first saw it. Was not expecting that.&&Did they ever fix that shit?&&> airplane edit

Wait, what? Never knew there was such edit.&&More importantly it was Deakins (Director of Photography) who said the film should be seen in 2:39:1 and intentionally framed it so that aspect ratio looks the best.&&I mean, most films are like that. Cameras don't actually shoot 2.40:1. IMAX is just another word for open matte these days.

Edit: It was actually Roger Deakins that said his preferred version is the standard 2D widescreen. http://screencrush.com/blade-runner-2049-2d-or-3d/&&The blu-ray is only 1.78:1 during the IMAX sequences, which is abut 70% of the film. The rest is in the 2.20:1 ratio.&&The camera films a larger picture than what the director actually wanted to capture. So open matte is showing that area.

An old example is Back to the Future. So instead of doing a pan and scan which is when people actually go through the movie to crop the sides based om where the action is so that the audience doesnt lose on crucial parts and to make it fit old 4:3 TVs for when it was aired or when it was put on VHS, they simply released an open matte version. The camera was already capturing a 4:3 image.&&Cells&&You’re not even close to baseline, HBO. &&In the first film they perform empathy tests on the replicants. In this film they are doing anti-empathy tests on the replicants. &&[deleted]&&Check emotional stability. Try to agitate them and measure responses&&In addition to it being a poem, as mentioned previously, the poem comes from Vladimir Nabokov’s *Pale Fire*. *Pale Fire* also happens to be the book that Joi wants to read to K when he comes home, which he turns down. &&Its essentially this movie's ""voight-kampf"" test, but the intention is slightly different. In the original, the test is to identify a replicant by giving them scenarios that would evoke a human to have emotion. Its intention is to detect a replicant who is either giving emotionless responses or trying to fake those responses by looking at things like pupil dilation, stress in the voice, heartrate, etc. Things that are involuntary and cannot be faked. 

The baseline test is meant to make sure Nexus 9s are staying in line with their programming. Instead of a rather personal, one on one conversation with emotional scenarios to detect subtle responses, it is a highly inpersonal and cold test and is meant to deliberately try to stress the subject out. The subject is given abrasive and emotion provoking questions and statements in rapid format with keywords attached that the subject then has to repeat in just as rapid a fashion. The subject is graded by how quick and orderly his response to the keywords are. If the subject begins to hesitate, trip up due to the questions and statements, as K does in his second test, they are off their baseline by having an emotional response, which is forbidden amongst Nexus 9 replicants.&&http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Baseline_Test&&achilles they are cheap asf... 400 55"" roku 4k tcl.. love it&&hdr alone is a legit reason to upgrade. 

coco and planet earth ii  in hdr  really showcases the technology.&&I have a 4k Tv and it's great, but no 4k player.

The 4k players I've seen are very expensive and Netflix really doesn't offer a lot with their 4k option so I've just been stuck with a 4k Tv with no way to play 4k on it. Unless you're heavy into streaming stuff I wouldn't say it's even close to a necessity just yet.&&I got a decent HDR for cheap as well, it's a TCL P607. They may have released a new one, but at 55 inches at $600, I couldn't complain&&Interstellar is one of my all time favorites. Seeing it again on my OLED in HDR was like watching it for the first time. Also Coco is great in HDR.&&I rarely visit the cinema but I took the day off work to see bladerunner 2049. So glad I did. The sound was so loud it was overpowering and I love the soundtrack. Visually stunning...I felt like I was stoned or something. Interstellar had the same effect.&&You speak my language&&Was definitely the best movie experience I've ever had. I went with some friends and was coming off of a lot of cough syrup which negated the length factor of the movie for me, I just sat and let it wash over me. &&For this film, SDR is fine, honestly. Roger Deakins himself doesn't like HDR and when he colored the HDR master for 2049, he basically limited the thing to SDR brightness anyway - which in my opinion, fits the dingy scenery of the film better than crazy bright sci-fi colors.

The 4K resolution will definitely show some detail benefits over the 1080p bluray, though, even when the camera used ""only"" films in 3.4K. And the h265 compression and bitrate on the 4K disc will provide less artifacting and a smoother image.&&Sorry bud. You might get a chance in like 30 years once the next generation discovers it. &&Make friends with the manager of a movie theater. Then see if s/he'll hook up a 4k blu ray player to the projector and let you watch it in a theater after hours with them.&&I was really sick last summer and didn't make it to the theater. The one film I regret not seeing last year in the theater.&&This is me so much. I am praying one of the art theaters near me (I'm in Philly) decides to show it sometime soon so I can have the experience. &&I did so, too. Pure laziness cost me the chance to be part of future nostalgia. Still, this is possibly the best movie I’ve ever seen.&&Same here, I was busy with school and didn't make it to the theater. I would love to see this in a theater. &&I hadn’t seen the original when I saw it in the cinema and I loved it. I still haven’t seen the original actually, though I know a bit of the plot. I think 2049 is enhanced by having seen the original but also stands alone fine.&&[deleted]&&Just do yourself a favor and watch the first. &&Yes. Ive never seen the original or any other blade runner movies and this was very enjoyable. It doesn't rely on past plots or stories, its an entirely unique story.&&You're good people.&&A movie in its original size still does not fit on a modern HD TV or monitor (unless you have an ultrawide display). 

They're not cutting out nearly as much as they did before to get a movie to fit on a tube TV, but they still have to cut off a good bit to cut it down from 2.XX:1 (film) to 1.77:1 (your standard 16x9 HD TV). Especially in the case of blade runner which was shot with a very wide, 2.39:1 aspect ratio.

The video just uses the 4x3 aspect ratio since the older movies they reference were all ""pan and scanned"" onto tube TVs for home replay and lost a lot because of it. &&Somebody else commented here that works they are on the hbo support team that they receive calls every single day from people complaining that the image doesn’t take up the entire screen. What they don’t know is that it is supposed to look like that to fit the entire frame of the shot onto people’s TVs. So HBO got fed up with the calls and just pan and scan everything to not deal with it. But as seen with this movie they are staring to not do that anymore. &&That’s a bummer. It’s a good ice breaker when making new friends in the future though. I met one of my best friends in college because we all loved the same films my high school friends hadn’t appreciated.&&Hey y’all got any recommendations for similar films? I really loved this one and need more somber brutalism in my life :P&&I woulda woke that fucker up&&I went to see it in theaters on the last showing of the last day it was to play.

THAT'S how you go see a movie. There wasn't another soul in the theater. Best seat, no shitty people talking, nothing but me and Blade Runner. Glorious.

Just had to wait a couple months to see it. Which I'm fine with. &&Hate to be that one guy that goes crazy over super hero movies but Thor: Ragnarok last year was TREMENDOUS. Probably *one* of the best marvel movies to date. It was probably my favorite film of last year.&&But bruh, FX...has the movies.&&For the original BR, how many cuts were released besides the Director's Cut?&&If they hope for it to turn a profit, this could be one way to do it.&&Seriously. I could watch that movie for hours. &&The ""Kingdom of Heaven"" treatment&&It’s not just mainstream appeal, it’s the fact that movie theaters are dying as a business model. People mostly only go to big action spectacles in the theater these days. Per capita movie attendance is at its lowest in forever. Home experience is just better. I didn’t see BR2049 in theater either and it’s because I just can’t stand going to the theater. Bought that shit on Blu-ray day of home video release though. 

Edit: for anyone doubting the decline of US theaters or the rise in home theaters being the preferred better experience for viewers

The result is on some screens with a wider aspect ratio, you can end up with bars on all sides.&&To elaborate on what /u/ZappySnap said: [here's an illustration](https://github.com/xternal7/ultrawidify/raw/master/img-demo/example-jasonbourne.png).

If you want to see an example of this issue in action on a 16:9 monitor:

* play any movie or TV series filmed in 18:9 or 21:9 on Netflix with your browser maximized but not full screen
* go to youtube, open [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPEYpryMp2s&t=16s) [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke1Y3P9D0Bc) [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ3U1inHA4), [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiYuIsPxYk); switch to theater mode.

Fucking amateurs.

(And to make things worse, Netflix uses DRM so  you can't write a script that would automatically detect the aspect ratio and correct things automatically ^([unless you use Firefox, which you should])).&&-> original widescreen presentation

-> change TV to 4:3 and forget how to change it back&&\*hurk\*&&Yeah my grandad likes to stretch it to prevent burn in...&&Oh no... here comes the embarrassing question. Why is original widescreen better? I too change the aspect ratio to fit (as a very recently moved out teenager). Just a warning, I don't know shit about TVs (clearly) or cords or anything like that. Sorry for the inexperience! &&My Uncle has had a projection 60"" 1080i TV connected to a cable box with a coaxial cable and watches everything with a stretched 4:3 aspect ratio for about a decade now.&&Fortunately for me my parents learned their lesson the first time they did this, but that one time was a goddamn nightmare. &&My dad is the same way. He also wants all the surround sound speakers to play the same sounds all the time. I tried telling him that’s not how it works. He doesn’t care. “Why pay for all these speakers if they don’t all play?!”&&When it’s time, drop him in a terrible nursing home on the other side of the country. &&You should get him to pose for a group photo and put him on the edge of the frame. Then print it out and go buy a square or close to square frame to put it in, and chop off the edges so that it'll fit-hopefully chopping off half of his face.

Then when you present it to him tell him you cropped the image because you know how much he hates having bars on his pictures, so it's full screen.&&To be fair, this is how a lot of people are \(im arguably one of them\). They don't give a fuck about ""4k"" They just want to be able to watch a tv without black looking blue but it seems every ""videofile"" nowadays just would rather shove the cheapest 4k led with horrible contrast  as long as it's ""crisp"". 

I remember when I bought a used Marantz 720p projector when 1080 was all the rage because it had some of the best black levels. You should have seen people losing their shit when they saw it in action asking if it is next level hd and all this nonsense just because they never see a good image with good contrast.

He was probably just annoyed that the black bars were so distracting, I'm the exact same way. I was buying plasmas for 600 when they weren't even making new plasmas anymore. I, myself, wish they would have perfected an affordable 1080p image before moving on to 4k. But I suppose those are inherent limitations to the tech so improve where you can.

I still pray nightly for oled to finally become feasible, and it is almost there. Until then I try to ignore the horrible blue\-blacks that plague 95&#37; of sets these days&&> edit: Getting a lot of weird replies to this. Reddit has some serious daddy issues.

You won't get any from me. My daddy was never around growing up.&&Or they just don’t like looking at small people. I gotta say I sympathize. A long time ago I tried watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on an iPod video; that shit was rough.

He doesn't like the black bars.[ I explained to him that Pan and Scan is literally a re\-edit / re\-directs the movie and cuts out a lot of the film.](https://youtu.be/5m1-pP1-5K8)

I also use to prefer Pan and Scan when I was a child. But I was an idiot and didn't know any better. Now I understand that it is the absolute worst thing you could do to a film.&&They can also be open matte rather than pan and scan.&&If someone can't afford a tv big enough to watch wide format movies they can't afford HBO.&&About 10 years ago, a friend of mine jumped on the Blu\-ray bandwagon and was all for it. He went out, bought a Sony BD player \(which were like $250 at the time\), upgraded his Xbox 360 to one with an HDMI, and spent like a week bragging to me about his setup. Myself being a home theater enthusiast was pretty excited, since we hung out a lot and I have a pretty big BD collection of my own.

I go over one weekend to chill, and along the shelf are two Blu\-rays and a bunch of new, unopened Pan & Scan DVDs he bought from Wal\-Mart. Probably 20\-25 of them. I said ""Were these DVDs on clearance?"" He replied, *bragging*, ""No, I got those because the Blu\-ray player upscales to near Blu\-ray quality, so now I can fill the screen. Don't gotta worry about the crappy, cropped Blu\-rays.""

I have never wanted to smack someone harder in my life than I did at that very moment.

Not much to my surprise, he often complained about how much sharper the Xbox 360 games were than the full\-screen DVDs, and would come up with all kinds of excuses for them.&&Nah, it's a relic from the old days when TV's were tiny and had a different aspect ratio&&[deleted]&&Like all things should be&&That's like this whole thread&&this but unironically&&I mean ""fuck em"" is a little harsh but it just makes no sense. You are chopping off large chunks of the picture that were filmed.

Really enjoyed it. &&Larry Fong is one of the best in the business&&I know, right? I watched it expecting a serious B movie, but it was... well, okay it was still sort of a B movie, but a pretty good one with very good cinematography.&&I was not expecting the rather gratuitously violent deaths that about 90% of the military people received. The cinematography was on point though&&They haven't. Watched it on HBO a few days ago and ratio still jumps all over the place between scenes.&&Yeah sorry should have been more clear. I bought the film but haven't actually watched the whole film on Blu-ray yet. From seeing it in Imax though most of the film will be  1.78. Did HBO just do 2.2 or is it both on HBO like the Blu Ray?&&This is a great example, and I'll give another, more modern day example.  


David Fincher is notorious for shooting his films at a higher frame size than the intended display size. So he'll shoot 6K, 8K, or even 10K and then do a ""centre crop"" of the image.

This allows him to do stabilization, or easily split screen various takes in post production. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and presumably Mindhunter all used this technique \(and some of the VFX breakdowns you can find online will showcase it\).   


But what this means is that he's literally throwing away up to half the image that the camera captured. However since it was always framed within the 4K centre crop it means you're never actually losing anything he didn't want you to see.&&Interlinked&&It’s not baseline. It’s hbo. &&To add, in the first film they perform empathy tests on people because replicant empathy is flawed and so the tests reveal if they're human or replicant. In the first film replicants were on the verge of breaking those tests.

Fast forward to 2022. A replicant terrorist attack/rebellion caused a blackout erasing databases where replicant identities were registered. Huge scandal and meltdown event. This is told in 2049 in a sort of ""show don't tell"" way, but some people manage to miss it.

Fast forward to 2049, things are tense as hell despite it being 2 decades later because replicants attacked humans in the blackout. (Which is why K has graffiti slurs over his door.) And after the blackout there are still tons of potentially violent refugees in hiding.

In 2049 they make sure that the working replicants aren't developing erratic emotions, using that test designed to trigger a response in them, out of fear that a repeat of the replicant rebellion/attacks happens.

Thankfully they had spare HDMI cables around.&&""Why is Ryan Gosling 8 feet tall in this?""&&widescreen, in letterbox, broadcast 4:3, stretched to 16:9.&&Can black burn in to CRTs? The DOS prompt is white on black for a reason, probably.&&When you change the aspect ratio there are only two real ways to do that. Either you crop the original size to fit the different aspect ratio, and sacrifice the outer edge of the original film, or you stretch the image to fit which distorts the original. Both alter the film or show from what the director and cinematographers had in mind when they originally shot it and it can fundamentally change the composition of a shot. 

That can lead to awkward situations where someone appears onscreen later than anticipated or two characters get uncomfortably crammed into a scene or even just some of the set gets lost in the pan and scan process.

We paused it and he ran home and grabbed his spare $600 Sub, came back and we spent an hour reconfiguring the speakers and hooking up the subwoofer. Sat and watched the show and it was EPIC!

You have broad, evocative, and often potentially cathartic phrases and allusions to a broad range of experiences enriched further if one has personally experienced what's being stated in those phrases.

Then, following each of those enriched, cathartic phrases, you have a single word of association. And in this poem, the same word is used and associated with multiple different experiences and phrases; but the use of the same word to describe all those myriads of experiences is deadening, minimalist, and devoid of all the catharsis and emotion that initially accompany the phrases.

In short the poem is sort of a realtime realization of discovery and hope paired with tragedy of minimalism. Or, in the context of bladerunner: it was a test to see if the blade runner could keep his emotions in check (demonstrated by an unwavering baseline when matching the minimalist word to the evocative phrases), or if he was beginning to go beyond his programmed parameters and gaining sentience via emotion or reaction to the phrases (or, perhaps more aptly, to the tragedy surrounding the pairing of those single word responses to such cathartic phrases reflecting genuine, sentient, experience). &&All of the sections at the top give you a bunch of associations to each phrase: cells, interlinked, stem, against the dark etc. 

Then the final lines at the end give you those same phrases again, without their associations. But instead of reading the phrases as nonsense, you read them by recalling their associations, and so all the repeated phrases at the top in a way kind of teach you how to read the poem at the bottom (the final seven lines). The last seven lines have been impregnated with associations. It's a neat trick with language. I've never seen it done before.  

Also get this, apparently [Ryan Gosling wrote the poem/Baseline Test himself](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/171747/why-was-the-book-pale-fire-used-in-the-blade-runner-2049-movie) while researching the role, using a technique called ""dropping in"" with Nabokov's *Pale Fire*. Then they included it in the film.

> The Baseline was always a scene to me that held the key to understanding K. I wasn't sure what that key was during the preparation period of the film. In the script, the character was meant to read a small passage from Nabokov's Pale Fire, but there wasn't any insight as to why.

> In order to better understand the meaning of the passage and to give it a personal meaning, I enlisted the help of a wonderful vocal coach named Natsuko Ohama. She suggested a technique called 'Dropping In.' In this technique, you explore the meaning of each word of the text by exhausting every conceivable context in which the would could be used.

> The process is very long and repetitive, but it has a trance-inducing effect that can be very powerful and unsettling. I felt that if that technique were extrapolated into K's experience, it could be used to penetrate his psyche. I believed we could learn through a process of psychological erosion what his true emotional state was.

> I was very grateful to Denis for incorporating it into the film, because it unlocked my understanding of K, but also provided insight into the state of mind of those who would force this burden upon him.""

Things happen, but the plot is the weakest part.

Second one has all those things and a plot. Which is why people love it.

We bought her a big ol' plasma tv, cause you know... You gotta watch ""Murder She Wrote"" in all its Glory.  Anyway no matter how many times we tried getting her to use the HD widescreen channels she always watched it on the basic cable numbers.  By the time she passed there were two black bars burned onto opposite sides of the screen haha&&I still have my Harry Potter full screen versions because of this same logic, but I still love them&&If you're watching on a smaller TV set, it's understandable why you might be mad...Options to go fullscreen, or widescreen would be nice.

EDIT: Or they can learn how to use their TVs and it's features!&&It depends on the aspect ratio that the movie was filmed at. Directors choose different ratios to give different feelings in the movie. Most of the time one aspect ratio will be chosen for the entire movie but some directors like to change it up during a single movie. The most obvious intentional instance I can think of is in the first Hunger Games movie before they start the games the movie is done in a standard 16:9 aspect ratio and while the platforms are rising to start the game the screen is growing wide to give a more open feel. 

Just google aspect ratios and how they are used it will give you a better idea than I could&&As in all things that be &&I mostly agree but feel like John C Reilly was a real treat.

I'll have to upgrade my PS4 to the next gen console and hope that supports 4k BluRay.

Digital 4k movies are waaay overpriced.  Through Google Play movies UHD Interstellar is still $29.99, FHD is $13.99...&&You’re asserting that he limited the peak brightness to SDR levels, which I can assure you is not true. The HDR cut of 2049 absolutely uses HDR and uses it well. What it sounds like he was avoiding was *bad* HDR, which absolutely was the right move. 

HDR (when used correctly) affects *detail*, which still requires a much higher peak-brightness at a specular highlight level. This is very different from APL, which is going to represent the overall scene brightness.

Tl;dr: HDR != overall brightness.  &&It's worth noting that sometimes studios will pan & scan the original [open matte framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_matte) originally shot instead of the intended theater aspect ratio. You'll end up with extra footage above/below the intended action, which can have negative consequences if an actor wasn't wearing the proper shoes, or if a microphone cable or some other production object/shadow is visible in an area that was always intended to be cut out of the final version. The openb matte is much larger than the actual intended frame. 

Red Letter Media talked about this in their ZAT review: https://youtu.be/UFkkVhiR1Yo?t=21m18s (timed to the right section for the lazy). The actor playing the monster has nike shoes on during one scene which is visible in the DVD release which features the open matte framing.&&Ok gotcha.

Aquaman : First image of Black Manta,40664,8r3f6s,https://i.redd.it/xp69x2r5yz311.jpg,2558,1528995194.0,,"Since this was posted first and blew up the most, [here's a link to all images released by Entertainment Weekly today](http://ew.com/movies/aquaman-photos//?__twitter_impression=true) including an image of Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master and a peek of Nicole Kidman on the cover of the issue.&&I didn't expect that level of accuracy on the mask.&&As a fan of Young Justice, I really hope that they portray Black Manta well. He is such a great villain.&&Yesterday was Wonder Woman day and today’s Aquaman day. I see you DC.&&[First look of Black Manda from Entertainment Weekly !](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/14/aquaman-black-manta/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)
>Aquaman’s nemesis Black Manta has surfaced at last!

>Below is a first look photo at a cunning high-seas pirate and mercenary named David Kane* (The Get Down‘s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who you’ll meet in DC’s upcoming standalone Aquaman movie. Here you see him working on a prototype of his iconic super-suit, which famously blasts red plasma beams from his eyes.

>Not much is yet known about the character in the film, and that’s exactly how director James Wan wants it. “He’s part mercenary but full-time pirate who in his suit will look like some crazy alien from outer space,” Wan teases.

>Yet Manta is not the main antagonist in the film. That honor goes to King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Aquaman’s (Jason Momoa) ambitious half-brother who governs Atlantis. “Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,” Wan says. The film also stars Amber Heard as Princess Mera, Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna, and Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus.

>The reveal comes on the heels of EW’s exclusive report on Tuesday where Warner Bros. and DC executives gave their thoughts on Aquaman after having seen some of the completed footage. Aquaman is released Dec. 21.

EDIT : 
>The armies of King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) face off in this exclusive first look at the fantastical underwater world of Aquaman — and there’s a lot going on beneath the surface. First, let’s take an unobstructed look at this new image:

[Here's a first look at Atlantis warriors riding great white sharks](http://imgur.com/gallery/PMckEWf) from [Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/15/aquaman-atlantis-sharks/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)

EDIT 2 : 

[Some new information about Patrick Wilson's character Orm !](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/15/aquaman-villain-patrick-wilson/)
>Thanos would give a thumbs up to Aquaman antagonist King Orm.

>Patrick Wilson, who plays Arthur Curry’s regal Atlantean half-brother in the upcoming DC film, gave EW some intriguing insight on the character.

>“He’s kind of an eco-warrior,” Wilson says. “He’s got a very clear gripe with the surface world, which has been polluting his oceans for centuries. And that’s something for me — I’m sure for you too — that’s very easy to understand. If somebody was just constantly polluting our air and ruining how we lived …” 


>The motive is a rather topical issue coming on the heels of UN chief António Guterres at the G7 summit last week warning of a “global emergency” due to oceanic pollution, noting, “Unless we change course, plastic waste could soon outweigh all the fish in the oceans … It kills marine life and is doing major harm to communities that depend on fishing and tourism.”

>Well-meaning comic-book movie villains are turning into a trend. Earlier this year Black Panther antagonist Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) was sympathetic in his goals to fight racial inequality. Last month, the blockbuster Avengers: Infinity War had Thanos (Josh Brolin) endeavoring to kill off half the population in the universe due to overpopulation concerns.

>In Aquaman, Orm seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms to declare war on the surface world (that’s us), an idea that doesn’t sit well with Curry (Jason Momoa).

>Wilson is a frequent collaborator with Aquaman director James Wan, who he worked with on the Insidious and The Conjuring franchises. One interesting thing about his casting is that with his blonde Anglo clean-cut features Wilson looks like a traditional Aquaman, while star Momoa resembles the type of actor who typically gets cast as the heavy. 

>Wan says he tapped Wilson because Orm isn’t an outright villain, he wanted an actor the audience would like — plus he just loves working with the guy.

>“Patrick is such a talented actor and a chameleon as well, he can disappear into any role,” Wan tells us. “Orm’s got a soft spot for his brother who lives on the surface world and if anything just wants him to rule Atlantis and the world together, but his brother doesn’t see it that way. A lot of the clashes they have stem from their different upbringings. So I didn’t want to cast a typical villain actor.”

Edit: Added new photos&&I'm glad we're getting comic book movies now where they just go ahead and actually make the characters look like they do in the comics.

Was hoping for Alex Ross version&&DC movies need to just go full force into their lore. And be true to the nature of the characters. Having superman be a killer out of the gate really diminished the impact of his character for me. It's not like people that want to see the movies can't handle how weird it gets sometimes. The people that don't want to see the movie won't see it either way. The animated DC stuff is so much better than the Marvel stuff. More of that universe and less of this shitty one they are still trying to bankroll. &&This can’t be a still from a DC movie. It’s too well lit.

Oceanmaster is the real focus.&&My favorite Black Manta scene in Young Justice is when he was going on a rant against The Reach that had some obvious racial subtext about not being a slave to anyone and the Reach being aliens who don't know much about Earth are like ""...okay""&&I hope they leave the opportunity for Kal'dur to make it to the big screen if this movie turns out to be good.

He was a really great original character in YJ, and deserved a more successful transition into other DC media.&&Black Manta: No agreement exists that makes a slave of Black Manta.

Black Manta: Manta guarantees that himself

Fucking chills first time I heard that. &&What makes him a great villain?&&I'm not familiar with Young Justice at all but Black Manta is a fantastic villain with a great design, hopefully they pull it off well. If they're smart, they'd work off of his Injustice 2 design, because it's great.&&And The actor is that plays him is so good also.&&I'd be so happy if we saw a live action Kaldur, but also sad cause they'd probably fuck it up&&He looks young though.

I mean if Wolverine had actually been in a full yellow spandex outfit with a ridiculous bat ear mask I probably wouldn't have taken his character seriously.

She's a huge fan of Black Manta and Aqualad.&&Man I can't wait until the new season of Young Justice comes out...&&I don't think there's any villain in comic books who truly hates someone the way Manta hates Aquaman. At one point in the comics Aquaman died, so Manta retired and opened a restaurant or something. As soon as Aquaman came back, he immediately went bonkers, killed everyone in his shop, and returned to hunt Aquaman again.&&He's one of DC's most hardcore and brutal villains despite just being a guy in a suit. He's the guy who takes it a step beyond most other villains. He's killed Aquaman's father, infant child, many friends and tries to ruin every single chance Aquaman ever has at happiness.

Unfortunately it’s not on Netflix anymore, and DC’s new service doesn’t come out for a few months, so you’d have to find it elsewhere.  (I just checked and it is on iTunes and Amazon.)

He obviously shouldn't have worn any kind of costume in that, since the entire point was that he wasn't a superhero anymore.  But if they can find a way to make Captain America, Iron Man, The Flash, etc. Look good in their costumes, they can find a way for the X Men.&&They probably wouldn't have given him any suit, even if we did get the classic suit.

The studio wants that facial recognition of the actors there paying to be in the movie . Always assumed that for Chris Pratt he never wears that mask.

https://io9.gizmodo.com/this-batman-joke-was-months-in-the-making-and-the-payo-1795369607

To make a good DC movie you need to realise that their motivations are aspirational rather subversion. That their villains are the subversion. It fails because they want to do what marvel does. 

That a D/C hero in the midst of everything... when it would be EASIER to drop the Joker to his death... would still save him. He wouldn't be branding people so that they died. That's so damn edgy and pointlessly so. &&Really? I hated him in JL. You have a guy that can control water/animals and not once does he utilize this in the movie. Instead he just...punches really hard and throws his trident. I dunno, I was disappointed.

But Wan knows what he's doing so I'm sure Aquaman will be completely badass in his solo movie. &&Exactly, I have complete faith in James Wan.&&It has been over 10 years since seasons 2/3 so I'm not surprised.&&[removed]&&[deleted]&&He's always been black in the comics&&That's more then I knew, I didn't even know he existed.&&Its because of the era they were created. &&Black Spiderman&&[deleted]&&Black Canary&&Black Adam&&TIL this. &&the majority of superhero comic books have been written by one demographic, white men.  there's a lot more problematic shit than just that.&&This always reminds me of the Harvey Birdman episode where Black Vulcan was upset that black was added to his name. When Aquaman told him its not too bad he was like oh yeah, how would you like it if i called you white fish!&&There's like 3. Black Panther, Black Lightning, and Black Manta.

There are plenty with ""Black"" in their name who aren't black. Black Widow, Black Mask, Black Canary, Black Hand, Blackhawk, Black Tom Cassidy, etc.&&Honestly it does sound a little cooler having ""black"" in front of their names. Although the only one that seriously feels right is Black Panther because of the group Black Panthers the name was inspired from. Guys like Black Manta and Black lighting seem a little silly to me&&It's deffinitely not. He's listed as Black Manta on the cover of his first appearance&&Busy raising the bar.&&Straight cash, homey.&&Even better! We might get the saucer shaped one later on!! &&I'm not really a fan of either villain.&&Not as a villain, but advisor, or something of that sort.&&He plays Vulko, an Atlantean and friend of Arthur’s. The main villain in this film will be Orm, Aquaman’s half brother.&&I'd love to see Aquaman have a ""Thor Ragnarok"" transformation where he loses a hand and cuts his hair. &&Thats little different because Civil War was mainly focused on characters that already had their own movies or have been in a bunch. Guys like Black Panther and Spider-Man were mostly side characters

3 of the main justice league cast never had a previous movie&&I think the dark universe comes more from the success of The Dark Knight than anything. Dark films were all the rage around then. And we were looking for the spiritual successor to that franchise. WB thought Superman was the next logical step lol.

Thank god we’re out of the Snyder era. &&This is how I know it's gonna fail.

Just make a good movie. Stop trying to set up sequels. If the movie is good, the sequel will come. And it will be hype. &&I think the movie should have been a bit longer tbh. I have no clue why WB seem to make most of their DC animated movies end after 1 hour and fifteen minutes. &&The animated movie did a shit job of portraying them honestly. Oceanmaster is supposed to be a fairly loving brother who is only a villain because he believes that he's unfairly being attacked by the surface and wants to defend his kingdom. He actually fully supports Aquaman as king. 

Manta on the other hand is a badass murder machine who whenever he shows up is almost 100% guaranteed to kill people. The relationship between Manta and Aquaman is one of pure hatred, beyond anything I've seen between other heroes and their villains. Like yeah Batman hates Joker and Superman hates Lex, but the Manta/Aquaman dynamic is way beyond that. Aquaman kills Manta's father, Manta kills Aquaman's infant child. Aquaman ""dies"" Manta becomes a cook. Aquaman ""comes back to life"" Manta slaughters everyone at the restaurant with a cooking knife and goes off to hunt Arthur down. I think he's killed someone just about every single time he appears. He's like a single minded murder machine with the sole goal of ""fuck Aquaman's life up as much as possible"". Even going so far as to give up the fight when Aquaman told him that if he (Aquaman) died Manta would have no purpose and gave Manta the option to kill him. 

The comic versions have so much potential compared to the animated movies' greedy treasure hunter and wannabe king.&&Manta is in the top three of “biggest dick” villains. He faked autism to screw with Aquaman. Repeatedly taunts him about killing his son. At one point, Aquaman was dead and Manta retired, opening a fish shop. When Arthur inevitably came back, Manta sees it on the news, kills everyone in the shop, and just wades out into the ocean. 

His only competition is a guy who time traveled to make his nemesis miss in little league and the Joker himself. &&[Black Manta](https://i.imgur.com/Yfhsejp.jpg) - Aquaman's archnemesis, pirate/merc/supremicist with a grudge and a high tech underwater suit.

[Young Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjLyg8S1iXY) - Animated series about a team of young DC heroes going on covert missions for the Justice League, one of the members (Kaldur/Aqualad) is Black Manta's son.

Looks for expensive, unique, and/or magical stuff, while taking illegal mercenary work to fund it. He killed Aquaman's father, then Aquaman killed Black Manta's father. Both murders were accidental, but Black Manta is the immovable object to Aquaman's unstoppable force.

**Ocean Master:** Aquaman's Loki, except he's like a futurepunk pirate. Wants to take the throne of Atlantis, fueled by resentment, envy, yadda yadda yadda. In the older comics he's fully human and in the newer stuff he's half wizard, but comic movies usually pick and choose. His trident is his power thingy, which depends on which origin you're going off of.

**Young Justice:** Teen Titans with near Avengers-level narratives. They're the covert B-Team, basically. The show takes place in a different timeline, so you don't have to worry much about continuity. They're kids, so the stories have a lot of coming-of-age development plotlines, but they're also powerful as shit and their actions have bigger consequences. 



&&Ok, I'll explain a little bit.
Young Justice is popular animated series made in 2011 and getting 3 season soon.
It's based on DC universe and have a cast of former young sidekicks creating a new team of heroes for cover operation.

It has good writing, action and high quality of animation, so it's no surprise it became popular. It was canceled by CN for not selling toys after season 2 sadly, however, WB decided to revive series on their new streaming platform, because fans annoyed them for years.

It so happens that Black Manta played big role in that series, and gained more popularity because of that.

He is one of the main Aquaman enemies and sort of underwater mercenary leader(I may got it wrong) with his own organization.

Ocean Master is another main enemy of Aquaman. It's his half-brother (in some versions brother) that wants to kill him and rule Atlantis as king.

I don't know any other big villains that Aquaman have, so it's logical they were chosen for the movie.&&Unironically, [Black manta]( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHXwRGjVi6bCBadEx01Fg9IocX4maHFSRWyjVrHmzyszFcKozs6gsRR0dNrw) is the best villain in the DC. &&Oceanmaster is kindve an anti-hero sorta. Like the only reason he was a bad guy was because he was tricked into it. He likes Aquaman and wants him to be king.

Black Manta is... well imagine a sortve underwater Iron Man (not quite at that level though) but he's insanely viscous and not all there in the head. The relationship between Manta and Aquaman is pure hatred, Manta has killed so many people Aquaman cares about, including Aquaman's own infant son. Manta's single goal in life is to cause as much pain and misery against Aquaman as possible in anyway.

Young Justice is like the earliest super hero team available. The heroes who aren't quite old/skilled/whatever enough for the Teen Titans join Young Justice. its like the 5th generation of heroes, but it hasn't been around for many years. Theres a show about it though (really good and season 3 is coming after god knows how many years).&&Such an underrated show, it doesn't get discussed enough when talking about how to correct the DC film franchises.

&&I know I've watched it a few times but it is by far one of the best shows. It has a lot of depth to it. I hope they make more&&In the original comics Harm's sister Secret was actually one of the main members of the team and Harm was a semi recurring villain, getting stronger and more warped each time he appeared.&&""*Welcome back.*""&&*I sent flowers, but you said you didn’t receive ‘em*&&*Gorgeous* is a masterpiece.&&i guess thats why they got me sittin in fuckin coach&&Oh the Beetles are all kinds of awesome: Think Iron Man’s extremis Armor but designed to take on Green Lanterns&&Yup, never really cared about Black Manta until Young Justice. Really shows what can be done with the chatachter in the right hands. Also kinda sad for the cinematic universe. When an animated Black Manta is a better villain than your live action ones, you’ve got some serious problems. &&When is that suppose to come out? I feel like it’s been a while since anything has come out about the show. &&Reverse Flash?&&Why so much hate? &&I've never been a DC fan, but that's some awesome stuff. &&So needless to say it's on-sight?&&His big ""thing"" is that he's autistic, but he's also clearly *a fuckin' psychopath*. In the comics, his whole reason for becoming a supervillain is that Aquaman *didn't see him* when he was being physically abused and tried to wave for help, so he swore a lifelong oath to destroy Aquaman... *and the sea*. He's two steps away from being in a super-gritty reboot of *Captain Planet* where Ma-Ti's power is to telekinetically pulp the hearts of bad guys in high-def X-ray mode.&&He's also really...really ruthless. If he comes at you with intent you are bound to lose something you love. &&he was interesting in his time with the Suicide Squad too. Especially him trying to keep them together during the Russia mission&&That's cool and all, but I wouldn't fight lizard Theresa May.&&/r/raimimemes &&I hate you&&Doesn't look that bad. &&I see what you did there&&Fuck you! You had really raised my hope&&YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I'VE SACRIFICED? >:(&&Worse that Rick rolling.

Reynolds had said that when he read the script, he saw that Guggy had wrote the entire GL oath wrong and that he had to go and talk to them to get it corrected.

Hopefully the next movie will work out considering its in much much better hands.&&An actor named Dolph lundgren PLAYING a character named Dolph lundgren??&&When think back on it as an adult, I wonder who the fuck thought of this, why they did it, how did they even come up with it, how did it even get approved, along with so many more questions &&I was expecting Insomnia-man to take that title.&&Well it is a pun, mystery solved &&Of course it's a pun, they did one on pretty much every caption. &&Silly /u/Havoola

&&He was on the nerdist podcast about five years ago and spoke about it&&Personally, I thought First Class had a good version of the uniforms. I thought the Yellow military-ish jumpsuits worked really well in the movie.&&Those characters have reasons to wear their costumes. Cap for propaganda/inspiration, Iron man so he can be a hero, Flash so he won't be naked after running. Wolverine on his own doesn't have much of a reason. As a member of the X\-men he might but a uniform would make more sense than individual designs with flashy colors like in the TV series. I haven't read the comics so I don't know if there's more to it than that.&&They didn't make all of those look exactly like the comics either. I didn't see captain America wearing fold over musketeer boots. Thor doesn't have an angel wing helmet. Aquaman's not really even close (no green spikey gauntlets and green spandex pants).

Some characters costumes can be adapted and some can't. I wouldn't have liked Jackman in that goofy costume in any xmen movie. &&The Flash looks terrible. The CW version even looks better than the movie version&&Are you talking about the first X-Men movie? Because that wasn't based on a comic run. It wasn't until after the movie came out that Marvel experimented with ditching the costumes in the comics.&&Pratt wears the mask a lot more than other characters (minus iron man obviously). &&Check out /r/Watches, literally hundreds of thousands of options out there that can fit any taste for under $1,000. Also never buy at retail unless you have to! This particular watch can be found for almost $300less than what their website advertises  (still new by the way) . Currently $665 on Amazon, and Hamilton is a very respected brand in our community.&&MAKE IT A WIN

URAH URAH URAH&&I think they made a typo when they were hiring. They got a Wan.&&Never thought of it like that, but pretty much. I feel that if Christopher Nolan was doing Aquaman, that's how he would do it. &&I agree.  As someone who actually enjoyed JL, I think Aquaman was the worst represented.  He really didn't do anything other than his ""My man!"" line while punching and poking stuff.  Luckily, his moment with the lasso of truth was gold, so I give it a pass. &&None of the JL heros really utilized their powers right, I think that was intentional. I never noticed until Batman made that joke but Aquaman doesn't even have a trident,  it just looks like a pitchfork.&&What? He saved them from the underground flooding using his water abilities. &&Unfortunately a lot of times (especially with the DC universe) it's been beyond the control of what the directors want. 

For example cutting down the time of BvS to the point where they removed a lot of crucial elements  just so they can fit one or two more showings of the film a day. &&Lol we’re old. &&Simple answer they’re not really into DC. I used to think that it was some silly conspiracy theory but at this point it’s super obvious. &&The mods of /r/movies are Disney shills. &&I need to see a photo of this.&&Correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression that the original creator of the character didn't come up with him being black, and just happened to have never revealed it.&&That's Venom&&What power does he have?&&Static, Blade, Flacon, War Machine...&&Explain Black Canary then. /s&&If you're referring to the Black Panther Party then that's incorrect. The comics character first appeared in Fantastic four #52, which was dated July 1966. The Black Panther party wasnt formed until October of that year.&&Wait, isn't it the other way around? The real life group was named after the comic book monarch. &&The bravest pioneer! &&In a sense Aquaman and Cyborg are pretty similar, though. The public knows the name ""Aquaman"" and that's it, they know nothing of his backstory, origins, even his powers. Cyborg was a complete non-starter for the public so the strategy of introducing him in a team up film seemed like a good idea, but he probably remains a nonstarter since JL was a box office flop (unless it does particularly well on blu-ray, which I have read it is not).

The original idea for The Flash film, when Rick Famuyiwa was in charge of it, was to have Cyborg be a major character in it as well, and THEN make the Cyborg movie. They might still pursue that direction.&&I hear ya, but I meant the mummy movie. It was pushing the [""Dark Universe""](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/11/8/16610248/universal-dark-universe-monsterverse-alex-kurtzman-chris-morgan)

I understand why you were confused with my meaning. I wasn't entirely clear. &&I trust James Wan tbh. &&!!!!!&&I'm so happy! He's one of my favorite directors! Thank you!&&I need to keep up with my director news... This is awesome!&&I never really cared much for Swamp Thing, but what they've done with him doing one shot issues in other characters Rebirth series, I've really been intrigued. &&>James Wan has a decent track record

So did David Ayer. &&Snyder was and is awful.&&I’m a huge Snyder fan. But I’m glad he’s not doing anymore dc movies. WB executives really wanted to change everything he did. Under Hamada’s leadership though, it seems that there will be much less meddling&&Yep, my main (maybe even only) gripe with the animated movies is how short they are. They’re pretty well done, but they seem so rushed. Like, Justice League: Dark was good, but I really wanted at least one or two scenes showing Batman actually forming/recruiting the Dark team.  Instead we just got:

“Hey, we want you as part of the Justice League.”
“Batman probably won’t like that.”
“Actually, he recommended you.”
“Okay, cool.”
*end credits*&&Because animation is expensive and those movies don’t sell super well. &&I think the movie should've been a bit better tbh.&&One thing that did Manta justice (no pun intended) was JLU where ""Devil Ray"" (DC couldn't us the name Black Manta for some reason) was a stone cold motherfucking killer. Like he was easily the most no-chill bastard on the Legion of Doom. He was killed on the show because he would not give up on trying to kill the Justice League even after the Legion were totally beaten, even if the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman came for his head.

Black Manta is fucking hardcore.&&Yeah but you can't really make an animated film that is basically 2 people killing each other's family's for 45 minutes and sell it to children.&&> Aquaman ""dies"" Manta becomes a cook. Aquaman ""comes back to life"" Manta slaughters everyone at the restaurant with a cooking knife and goes off to hunt Arthur down. 

I would like to know where this scene is featured. Sounds delightfully brutal. &&> He actually fully supports Aquaman as king

What? Literally both pre and post crisis versions of Ocean Master his driving force is his resentment of essentially not being Orin. &&DC has a lot of baggage. Before Marvel movies, Marvel characters weren't huge and had little knowledge from main stream audiences so the movies could go anywhere and define the characters. DC on the other hand had recognizable characters with established rules and laws set by cartoons and other movies. Going outside those boundaries is what has hurt the DCEU the most. &&""AHA I was just *pretending* to be retarded!""&&>a guy who time traveled to make his nemesis miss in little league

WHOA slow down there Satan.&&> Manta sees it on the news, kills everyone in the shop, and just wades out into the ocean.

Wait, so Black Manta has a thick, sticky consistency? **SCHWING!**&&I don't think it's underrated, everyone that has seen it sings it's praises. It's just went unnoticed for too long and was cancelled.

DC Universe launches late August, so probably around then.  I imagine they’ll want YJ to be one of their flagships given the anticipation and fanbase surrounding it.&&Right? Or how about Star Sapphire even.&&Aquaman killed his father I think? But their relationship has gone past that. Aquaman and Manta fight because they've been doing it so long and so viciously that their mutual hatred has destroyed any hope of reconciling Aquaman once had. Superman could forgive Lex Luthor. Aquaman can't do that with Manta.&&Aquaman didn't notice that he needed rescuing. In the original(?) continuity it was because he was kidnapped by Somali-style pirates. More recently, Aquaman was distantly visible from his apartment window and didn't see him wave for help to be rescued from abusive parent/guardians. He's *crazy* messed up.

There's a continuity where he was messed up from being in Arkham Asylum after they figured out that indiscriminately administering cold water baths was bad but before they figured out that wrapping patients with sensory issues with short-staple cotton sheets when all they wanted was a cold water bath was *also* bad, but I don't know if that's a new continuity or what happened after he stabbed his abusive dad to death in the second continuity that I mentioned.&&Yeah I like that he's mentally not all there. He joined the Suicide Squad to feel like he belonged. ISIS got into his head and he joined terrorists, up until he felt he was being lied to and slaughtered a ton of them. He haphazardly ruined a massive global crime ring due to his singular desire to hurt Aquaman. Like he killed the old leader, said ""Im in charge"" and all of their resources went towards trying to hurt Aquaman instead of using his newfound army and resources rationally. &&He *faked* being autistic so that Aquaman would take it easier on him. That's how much of a dick Black Manta is&&Yep.

WB was way more responsible for the current state of the DCEU than Snyder.&&Wasn't Ayer like 50/50&&The only thing I like from Ayer is Fury.

He's great at deconstruction, but those two aren't really characters that people want to see picked apart to become something else. 

Watchmen was a good movie, and it baffles me still that someone decided the guy who nailed a movie about picking apart the stereotypical superhero was also destined to be the guy to recreate the universe where the stereotypical superhero was born.&&I mean correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think Batman has much to do with anything in the original justice leagues dark books.

Pretty much, although Aquaman was created nearly 20yrs before Black Panther was.
&&Aquaman came first by about 20 years, but yes they are somewhat similar concepts. &&With a touch of Asgard thrown in (advanced society mistaken for *magic* becomes part of ancient human mythology)&&With the advantage of having shown up in the comics 25 years before Black Panther.  &&You mean Wakanda is just Atlantis but in Africa, because Aquaman's city debuted BEFORE Wakanda debuted?

Also, DC already had a secret advanced city in Africa years before Marvel created Wakanda.

I'm not saying one is better than the other, but DC isn't ripping off Marvel or anything.&&UNDA DA SEA!!&&It wasn't picked up by Netflix, it'll be on DC Universe, the DC streaming service launching later this year. &&It didn't go unnoticed.

Just some Atlanteans around a cube in a completely arbitrary place under the sea.

EDIT: As others below have noted, Wakanda appeared briefly in a post-credits scene. But, due to it just being the characters talking in a high-tech room with a quick shot of a large panther statue outside, I'd still argue that Wakanda didn't really make its appeareance until BP, even though that post-credits scene is better than what we got of Atlanis in JL. 

By pretty much any reasonable criteria, Wakanda was the first of the 2 to appear in a major live-action adaptation of the Marvel and DC works.&&",2018-06-14 12:53:14

I grew up reading Asterix and Tintin however; but both of those weren't too popular over here until they made films out of them.&&I read an animation blog that [reviewed one of the movies](https://unshavedmouse.com/2015/07/23/asterix-in-britain-1986/) and discussed this.

Basically after the Golden Age of comic books (WW2) there was a period before the Silver Age really got rolling and American comics became forever dominated by superheroes where Asterix *might* have gotten a shot, but at the time the distribution of European comics just wasn't there, and he missed his chance.

Same reason we're not as big on Tintin or Scrooge McDuck here, from the late 50s on we've almost exclusively had the association that ""comic books = superheroes"".&&Asterix is french so it has always been more popular in Europe. I grew up in the Netherlands and Asterix and Obelix were everywhere. Also played their videogames on my gameboy.&&As an American I’ve never heard of Asterix until this post, so yeah I’d say marketing is the issue&&They are very popular in India, along with Tintin. &&I loved reading asterix, though that was mostly because my mother's side was from france.&&Blame the mouse. In Canada, Tintin and Asterix were popular. &&It's a language thing... Possibly?

I grew up in French speaking Canada and now am adulting (is that even a word) in English Canada.

While everyone seemed to know about Asterix and TinTin back then, rarer are the people that know about this on the English side. Mind you the movies have helped, but lots of people think that TinTin is a Spielberg movie that wasn't very good. They have no idea about the history!

Don't even get me started on Smurfs (Schtroumpf in French). I am sure it was at least 3 or 4 years before all my English friends even knew what a smurf was. If you have never seen the Smurfs in French then you have no idea how much better it is than the English version. In French, they actually use the word smurf all the time as verbs and what not, they barely do it in the English overdub. &&This is the first time I have ever heard of this series. Can I find them somewhere?&&I read both European comics, American comics and Japanese Manga and I gotta say that from what I've seen, American comics really aren't too diverse. Maybe there's a ton of non-superhero/crime themed comics out there that I'm not aware of but I don't see many come out of America.

Meanwhile Europe gets Asterix, Lucky Luke, Suske en Wiske, Donald Duck and a whole bunch that are far more obscure and forgotten (has anyone ever heard of G. Rafzerk or Billie en Bollie?)

Okay, Japan has all of us beat with manga about everything and their grandma.&&Probably is. Also, the humor and references never really appealed nor applied to the US (not saying it never didn't, but it was very rare). Over here in Europe it's pretty damn big. &&I had a sega gamegear game from the series. It was a lot of fun but I never heard anything else about it. I'm assuming yes, it's bad us marketing&&They're very popular in India. I did manage to pick up a few Asterix and tintin titles form Barnes and nobles in NYC. &&Beats me.

I'm American and I've never even heard of Asterix before.  Was surprised to see this thread at the top.&&IIRC it was about the difference in paper sizes. European comic books are huge compared to the American ones, and American editors thought the books wouldn't sell if they were not scaled down. Unfortunately the speech bubbles get tiny that way and Asterix with abridged dialogue will inevitably suck.

This is a good sign.&&About time we get a quality Asterix movie. &&Didn't know there was one before this &&Are they still making Asterix books ?&&Is there anywhere where you can stream English asterix and obelix?&&About time we get a movie about asterisks&&They do this a lot depending on which language it is.

Asterisk and Tintin fit in well with the ACK, Chandamama and Gokulams  &&How does Asterix work in such a different culture? I always thought that so much of what makes Asterix fun is the satirical commentary on the different countries Asterix and Obelix visit. The casual Cervantes reference in Asterix in Spain, etc. I have a hard time enjoying Chinese movies, and I suspect that I am just not fluent in a lot of the cliches and tropes that they use to give background to their stories. Did they change the Asterix stories for the Indian market? Apparently they did change Asterix when they first introduced it to Germany (Asterix and the Goths, during the early Cold War), with the Gauls becoming (good) West Germans, and the Goths became East Germans....&&Probably Amazon. You should really get them, though. Here in Europe they are amongst the most popular comics book series. Way bigger than super hero comics, for example.

It takes place around 50 BC, during the time of Julius Caesar. There's one village in Gaul (roughly the area of current France) that the Romans can't conquer because of a magic potion only the local druid can make. 

While it takes place during the Roman Empire age, the jokes are often satirical commentaries on current and/or real-life events. Presidential elections are satirized through a debate between two Gaulish chieftains. A leaked but scrapped chapter of Ceasar's writings is used to parody wikileaks. A magic potion that grants superhuman strength becomes a funny commentary on doping in sports. 

There's also many jokes around steteotypes of certain countries. The British, for example, suddenly stop fighting the Roman Empire once tea time comes along. A Belgian village has two chieftains who are friends but are constantly squabbling in a parody of the Flemish/Walloon divide. Egyptians talk in hieroglyphs. There's some great running gags you will like as well.&&Amazon seems to have them all.

But I think the live-action movies are better in the original French (haven't seen the English versions)

You can also clearly see the difference in style between the Belgian-French comics and the American.&&I never cared for the live action Asterix movies, but the old animated ones were great.&&Appart from the direct BD adaptations, the mansions of the goods is the most true to the BD's spirit.

Pretty sure that one was decent at worst.&&Which one was the one where they did updated versions of the Labours of Hercules? Asteroid and the Labours of Hercules/12 Labours? I remember loving the scene where they learn aikido/judo and the maze of an office building &&There's [The 12 Tasks of Asterix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072901/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), which isn't great overall but has a couple of amusing scenes. Also it's *very* 1970s.

Oh yeah, also the [live-action movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133385/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6) from a few years ago. But I can't stand Gerard Depardieu (or Roberto Benigni) so I didn't give it much of a chance. &&Right?! Loved these comics as a kid :D

Edit- Apparently there have been several adaptations O.o&&They've been making Asterix films on a pretty regular basis every couple of years for the last five decades.&&After the death of René Goscinny (very talented scenarist), Albert Uderzo (illustrator) decided to continue the series alone and the quality gradually dropped till this terrible one with the Aliens. After that he stopped and the publishing house chose a new writer and a new illustrator, the quality is not as good as during Goscinny's Golden Age but it's far better than Uderzo's last ones, pretty decent overall.&&Sadly, they do. Without Goscinny it's not the same. &&Yes, and it's shit since *Asterix and the Falling Sky*.

Quite a wholesome story really.&&[deleted]&&My public library doesn't have a SINGLE Tintin book >:(&&I just got a tintin tattoo, I used to read them so much. Such incredible books, what an awesome tradition to share with your kids!&&Dude, it's worth giving the Asterix stuff a go, it's all silly and fun.&&Between Tintin and Asterix, I prefer Asterix, even if they're both fantastic comics. The best part about Asterix is that you can pick it up in pretty much any language; the translations are incredible. Better than just about any translation in any medium I've ever experienced.&&Entirely different series:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin

It's about a young reporter who manages to find himself in all sorts of adventure all over the globe, facing crime cartels, mysterious powers and hidden dangers. He's smart, capable and resourceful, by today's standards an almost too perfect hero and role model. Apart from some questionable early books that have aged terribly due to racism and poor research (which the author was aware of and later either changed or prohibited from being printed as long as he was alive), most of these are incredibly well drawn, tense, exciting adventures with an enormous attention to detail, wacky humor and endless creativity. The two books detailing a journey to the Moon are particularly noteworthy thanks to their excellent research, perfectly representing the scientific knowledge of the time (1950), but are still enjoyable many decades later.

Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson turned the series into a rather excellent movie a few years ago:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_(film)

There's also an older animated TV series that is very close to the comic books in terms of style and narration (but a bit censored in order to be marketed to younger children): 

https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x554je0

On Amazon and other streaming services (included in Amazon Prime where I live), there are old live action Tintin films from the early '60s that are a bit quaint, but very charming:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_and_the_Golden_Fleece

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_and_the_Blue_Oranges

They do an amazing job at capturing the atmosphere of the novels and are good-natured, lighthearted fun. The fight sequences are actually better than in contemporary James Bond movies, believe it or not.

There are other TV and cinema adaptations, but they are not as the ones listed here. There's also a BBC radio play that I'm not familiar with yet. It's available on Youtube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1-6qySk4C0

**tl;dr:**

Complete newcomers to the series should start with the Spielberg/Jackson performance-captured adaptation. Despite differing in terms of visual style, it's clearly a labor of love that pays great attention to the strengths of the source material and manages to create some remarkable action sequences. The comic books themselves are a fun read today, but one should be aware of the circumstances of their creation, the time of release (late '20s to mid '70s) and the intended audience (young - initially at least catholic - boys). Women and girls for example play almost no role whatsoever and Tintin is as asexual as he is adventurous. These books are in some ways more more mature than contemporary American graphic novels, but are at the same time aimed at younger audiences. As stated above, the early '90s TV adaptation dials some of the violence back (people are shot off-screen, for example), while being otherwise extraordinarily close to the comic books. Definitely worth watching. The two live action adaptations from the early '60s have more limited appeal, but are still fun, especially for those among us who like contemporary European comedy films.&&I know this is an honest question but I still want to kill myself&&Walking Dead in recent years. But that's probably mostly because of the show. &&That supports his argument though. Duck Tales clearly drew heavily from Carl Barks' and Don Rosa's classic adventure tales featuring the Duck clan. Which proves that those types of stories obviously held appeal for an American audience. And yet when they where delivered in comic book form, they never achieved the kind of overwhelming success they had in Europe. Which is doubly astounding when you consider that unlike Asterix or Tintin, they were the creation of American artists. &&It's mostly European pop culture. It was a sore point for me as a child wanting to talk about Asterix with my friends from the US and them having no idea what I was talking about.&&It's not so much a marketing issue as it is a distribution issue. Asterix has historically had extremely low distribution to the US and as a result isn't going to get marketed at all.&&I’ve been on the Internet for almost 20 years. I have also never heard of Asterix.&&It just isn’t popular in America. 

I’m a huge nerd, and I’ve even been to the comic strip museum in Brussels, and I can’t actually remember what Asterix’s deal is. &&Huh, I’ll have to look that up. I feel like I’m exactly the demographic that would know about it too, but yeah literally never heard of it&&I mean, it's a huge thing for us, but I've never read a US comic and only knew them through animated sunday morning shows and later Marvel movies. It's a cultural difference I guess&&To have heard of Asterisk in America, you will almost certainly need to learn about it if you take a French class in middle school or something. That's how unknown it is.&&Historically, the problem was you couldn't find it in stores stateside and they weren't advertised at all.  I've been a big fan of Asterix and Tin Tin comics since i was a kid, but that was because of my uncle introduced me to them and would send them to me from overseas. Before online shopping, you couldn't find these comics in a the larger brick and mortar stores. I was able to find maybe one or two that i already had, but I couldn't find most of them stateside.&&Live in America, never in my life have a hurd of it, never heard a reference to, never seen a meme or anything of it. IM 31&&I read Asterix as a kid but I have never heard it once mentioned in the past twenty years outside of my house until now.&&I grew up in India and Singapore and read Asterix and TinTin and it worked out just fine for me reading these as a teenager who’d had some exposure to world history at that point.  

Some of the puns may get lost, but for the most part, you only need a rudimentary knowledge of history/western culture to get a lot of the jokes. &&Due to it being a former British colony, India is very much influenced by European culture still. Maybe that's it.&&I don't know about changing the plot but as I understand it a lot of effort was put into localising the jokes.

The puns especially have an equivalent chosen for the target culture.

Given that I was reading the English translation and nothing ever felt off I'm sure they did a good job everywhere.&&My favourite was always drunk Romans hiccuping. Hic, haec, hoc!&&He is. He's preparing a movie. (or 3, can't remember)&&just watch it in original version with subs then&&Agreed, it was one of my favourite comedies as a teenager. Saw it again a couple of years ago and still had a great time.&&Yes but the other live action movies aren't great, Mission Cleopatra is the exception though. The Mansion of the Gods (from the team doing that new one) was good though. &&That is still my fav French movie ever. It's such a mix of everything that is french humor/pop culture from the late 90' to the '00. It's such easy and perfect humor.&&equally funny in French as in English \-\- the true genius of Asterix...&&Asterix in Britain anyone?&&That was live action, right? I liked it.&&It is a cult movie in France as far as comedy goes, alongside OSS 117 or La Cité de la Peur for exemple. The jokes in this movie are really mainstream references here haha&&Thank you !&&It's the best Astérix movie... but it came out in 2002. We're due for a new one.&&[Pas de palais... pas de palais.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghiMU3seRVM)&&I was so disappointed that The Mansions of the Gods flew under the radar for most people. It’s by far the best Asterix movie I’ve seen – it captured the comics perfectly. 

I was pretty sceptical when I started watching and it took all of ten minutes for the movie to pull me right in. If this is by the same people then it’ll be a must-see. &&Do these movies get released in theaters in the States, or do they go straight to disc and streaming?

I remember in my childhood, my Mom and Dad took a trip to France, and my Dad brought home Asterix books. Without the Internet, I'd tell my friends about this comic called Asterix and Obelix, and they would just shrug their shoulders and move onto an American topic. &&What? There was one? Animated even? o_O&&I remember so little of Asterix, but we used to get to watch them when I had to take a french class in 3rd grade (I know... french in 3rd grade.. wtf). Was there a guy who had like one big strong arm and one regular arm or am I totally mixing stuff up?&&Is this one by the same creators? If so, I’m confident that it’ll be good&&Even if it's not the one I'm waiting for.&&The only live action one I like is vs. Caesar, it had an great soundtrack, and was funny, and had good acting from all of the characters &&I watched the English version dubbed to Swedish when I was a kid. Needless to say it sucked. &&There's actually a lot of them.

9 animated films and 4 live action films.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asterix_films&&12 tasks has so much to quote though. I still see people reference the permit a38 or what ever it may be called in other languages.&&Mission Cleopatre is usually brought up as one of the best French comedies of the decade&&I absolutely loved 12 Tasks as a kid. I've probably still got the DVD lying around somewhere...&&> There's The 12 Tasks of Asterix, which isn't great overall but has a couple of amusing scenes. 

I take offense in that /s

But no kidding, one of my favorite movies of all time. Not due to nostalgia alone, I think it's pretty damn well made&&The second live action movie is great. Haven't seen the third and fourth, but I've heard that the former is terrible and the latter decent. &&Are you kidding ?

Wikilix may have just made me laugh so loud my poor housemate is probably thinking WTF.&&I always loved Assurancetourix (comprehensive insurance)&&Yeah, the english ones seem to be more fitting!

I just remembered the bard, Cacophanix.&&Apparently whatever language they translated into \(including some in latin!! Why??\) they re\-created the wall\-to\-wall puns that came with the original French versions. The books are satisfying in any language. 

Their druid that gives them the magic potion is Getafix.  There was a character in French called Assurancetourix.  \(Travel Insurance\)&&What was the original?&&And just to clarify for non german speakers why ""Verleihnix"" is so amazing: Not only is it a pun with the word ""Verleihen"" (loan, lend) and the typical asterix ""-ix"" ending, but as he said, it can also literally be read as ""(Ich) Verleih' nix"" ( ""(I) Won't lend/loan nothing""). That the word ""nix"" (colloquial ""nothing"") exists in german gave them some amazing opportunities in names.

Also, the druid was called Miraculix and the bard Troubardix. Fun fact: The recurring pirate captain is called ""Enternix"", which, similar to my first example, literally means ""Board nothing"", as in he doesn't get to board a ship, lol. &&heh, sometimes it works. The Tintin movie was great, and some other foreign properties (Edge of Tomorrow, The Departed...) did good too.&&Yeah I know he's working on the Kaamelott movie trilogy. &&[asterix](https://i.imgur.com/DqOt7kc.jpg)

There are also American translations that have entirely different names. If I recall his name in those books is Magicgimmix or something like that. But I grew up calling him Getafix.&&Absolutely fantastic and a good reason alone for reading the books for anyone interested. I took them completely for granted as an English kid, and it took a few years for the penny to completely drop as to just how much work must have gone into translating their Discworld-level density of puns. Especially given that the format must be especially unforgiving for a translator, as everything has to fit into the same number of panels and the same sized speech balloons.&&I mean when your effort needs to be literally Herculean..&&I've never read this in English, they all have french accents even when reading. That's so weird. &&He doesn't take any potion in the comic either.&&They take it initially, but get busted for doping.

I thought European comics were pretty much universally ignored over there. It's a shame really, i far prefer them to the superhero stuff across the pond.&&There's nothing I need more in my life right now than a new Tintin movie.

I have no clue why this is on the front page and how so many people are excited over it. &&cheeky gaul&&When you say 'huge nerd' are your interests more in line with sci-fi, Star Wars, and that sort of stuff? Or more in line with medieval times, vikings, ancient Egypt/Rome, etc. ?

When I was a kid I was more on the side of medieval/ancient stuff, didn't really give a shit about Star Wars or sci-fi or any of that, and when I found Asterix I became an instant fan, thought the theme/content was incredible and really drew me in. 

I do agree though it's not very popular in America. Almost none of my friends read Asterix comics back then. 

&&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_comic_series&&That’s most Americans too.

Yes it is by the same team.&&> best Asterix movie

But did it have Monica Belluci and Snoop Dogg? I bet not.&&IDK, I much preferred the original line of Asterix movies.  This was a decent film don't get me wrong, but Aterix the Gaul, Asterix and Cleopatra, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix, Asterix in Britain, Asterix and the Big Fight and a couple others were just as, if not more enjoyable as the Mansion of the Gods, and were definitely more based on the comics than that one was.  Probably because Goscini and Uderzo had a say in the writing of those movies.&&>by far the best Astérix movie

I still can’t get over how much detail they put into the animation and the secret Easter eggs they put throughout the movie referencing different comics. &&I'm 30, and I loved Tintin as a kid.  When I was 7 my dad would check them out from the library and would read them to me; eventually I started reading them myself.  Our libraries usually had a dozen or so issues at least, if not all of them (well, except Congo).

But it's pretty regional, some people never heard of Tintin until the movie came out.

I'd say prior to the movie it was cult level status of popularity.&&>Is Tintin well known in the US?

In my experience, it's a very niche market. There was/is a shop in Seattle (where I live) that sells *Tintin* comics, and when I found it, I was completely geeking out about all the stories and characters. One of the sales associates (jokingly) referred another customer to me, because it appeared that I knew more about the series than the associate did. 

To my knowledge, the movie *did* raise *Tintin*'s profile in the U.S., but primarily because it had such big names associated with its production and cast, and not really on the merit of the adaptation itself. 

EDIT: That said, Box Office Mojo writes that ""In the United States, it is one of only twelve feature films to be released in over 3,000 theaters and still improve on its box office performance in its second weekend."" http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/smallestdrops.htm?page=DROP3000&p=.htm&&[Here we go!!](https://i.imgur.com/wu2rIiXr.jpg) &&Don’t worry I won’t but thanks for caring&&I'm pretty much caught up. The issue I'm seeing now is that they keep introducing characters without doing really anything to develop them. So when they do kill off a main character every once in a while, it further narrows the scope of the story. Plus, [Maggie](#spoiler) is still alive but isn't a main character anymore, for whatever reason. 

I still read them when my library gets them, but I wouldn't buy them I guess. &&Asterix is a huge deal in Europe. As a Frenchman, I grew up reading these comics, and it's definitely a huge cornerstone of our childhood culture.&&""An American discovers there's a world beyond his country""&&Most French have read Astérix comic thought.&&And he refuses to use crowdfunding because he doesn't want to be beholden towards the funders.

Was kinda weird how they kept switching asterix in the live-action ones, though.&&There are quite a few:

Exciting!&&All I remember from it is that Obelix's girlfriend gets a magic clone who explodes into bubbles or something.

The problem is just that its hard to talk about internationally, since all the characters are named differently in every language (sorta like Pokemon).&&Ï wouldn't know, I'm French myself 😄&&Fwiw, I live in the US and I grew up with it as one of my family’s favorite movies. I’ve met basically no one else who has heard of it though.

My friends and family are still quoting it often, myself included.&&Mansions of the gods wasn't by Chabat though, but Alexandre Astier also has the humour and wit to match Goscinny's.&&That's definitely a good sign.

[Is this a screenshot from Asterix](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVXrWxkWcAABurz.png)? It is all I can find.&&It did not get lost. 

It was in pre-production but got cancelled 8 months in, after the comic creator was unsatisfied with the previous movie (Mission Cleopatra) and ruled out a new one by the same people. A few years later they did make a new movie anyway despite that (at the Olympic Games) and it bombed.&&I was curious too, but I haven't been able to find anything about it. &&From what I read, Gérard Jugnot started working on that film but the project didn't happen. Jugnot actually pitched his idea to Uderzo, who turned it down because he thought that Jugnot's idea wasn't in the spirit of Astérix.

An old guy lashing out some casual xenophobia. More at 11...&&Yeah, that's how it's done in the original too.&&Ok thanks. In the comics they were written that way, so I guessed as much. Overly polite too, and obsessed with tea. :D&&In the English translation they're over the top super posh, kind of like how Americans think we speak. ""oh I say, old chap"" and all that.

He's doing the opposite. I don't see how a bunch of random, numerous founders from Kickstarter campaign have any impact whatsoever on his artistic freedom. Or on anything at all for that matter, it's the main weakness of the platform for most failed projects, but would clearly be a strength for him.

I would say that the real reason is that there is no way crowdfunding would be able to gather nearly enough money for the movie he wants to make.

Doing a crowdfunding campaign avoids executive meddling if it can fund you entirely, but for big projects, as you mention, that probably won't be enough and you'll need financing partners anyway. The main differences it makes is A) it funds you through an early pre-production phase so you have more enticing stuff to show for your pitches to get a full budget, and B) it helps getting partners on board because you have solid proof that a certain number of people are very eager to see your project made.

Now, as much as I agree with you with regards to ""traditional"" investors not giving you full artistic control, there's something to be said about crowdfunding. While you're technically correct that backers have no actual power on the product being made, often times, projects that start up with a crowdfunding campaign end up depending on those backers for their public image. It ends up being an underlying pressure that has definitely derailed a lot of crowdfunded projects.&&in France you have to live in a cave to miss asterix comics. &&> Je ne crois pas qu’il y ait de bonne ou de mauvaise situation. Moi, si je devais résumer ma vie aujourd'hui avec vous, je dirais que c’est d’abord des rencontres. Des gens qui m’ont tendu la main, peut-être à un moment où je ne pouvais pas, où j’étais seul chez moi. Et c’est assez curieux de se dire que les hasards, les rencontres forgent une destinée... Parce que quand on a le goût de la chose, quand on a le goût de la chose bien faite, le beau geste, parfois on ne trouve pas l’interlocuteur en face je dirais, le miroir qui vous aide à avancer.

Asterix was called Soora Pappa, which sort of translates to 'super uncle' and Obelix was called Jim pappa.&&I guess the trick is \- do they do it well?

The problem is that the original books \- French, English, or two dozen other languages \- were simply LOADED with puns in whatever language they were published in. My step\-sister who was quite a few years older assured me even the latin versions \(!!!\) of the books were loaded with puns. &&If you're thinking of Spirou and Tintin, they re not from the sale period as Astérix.&&If you want a great Belgian comic I advise either Herge's work (especially Tintin, originally French) or Willy Van Der Steen's work (especially Suske en Wiske, originally Dutch).&&funny that is what I remember out of everything from that entire cartoon.&&Comic creator was dead long before the movie came out.

If you read the comics in order of publication you can pinpoint the exact time when the original creator died: it's when the comics stop being funny.

Old guy - Agecanonix (""âge canonique"" = ""respectable age"")  
Fishmonger - Ordralphabétix (""ordre alphabétique"" = ""alphabetic order"")  

One of my favorites has always been the blacksmith though: Cétautomatix (""c'est automatique"" = ""it's automatic"").&&That cave would have Astérix drawing on the wall.&&Big fandom in Germany as well. 

Grew up with leatherbound hardcovers of four volumes per book. Missed at least half the jokes as a child and from what I read they are even funnier in the original based on the cultural context.

Ewan McGreggor to Play Danny Torrance in ‘Shining’ Sequel ‘Dr. Sleep’,35502,8qw6e4,https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ewan-mcgreggor-to-play-danny-torrance-in-shining-sequel-dr-sleep-1202838484/,1754,1528924884.0,,"But can it be made in such a way that Stephen King hates it? &&He got the role over Chris Evans, Matt Smith, and Jeremy Renner.&&Oh boy. I had no idea *Dr. Sleep* was being made into a movie. 

This one is going to be very, very interesting. &&Half that book is really pretty good (the adult Danny stuff with the girl), a worthy followup to The Shining. But I thought the villains were comically terrible.  &&GOD DAMN it where is Obi Wan movie announcement &&Hello there, Mr. Torrance&&A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.&&Who’s playing Rose the Hat?&&Try the Shining, that’s a good trick!&&He's PERFECT (for the role, and also in general)&&I know it gets a lot of flak, but Steven Weber was really good as Jack Torrance in the mini series.  You really saw his character actively fighting his demons and trying to be better for his family only to slowly descend into madness as The Overlook played on his alcholism and took control.  All respect to Kubrick, Nicholson looked crazy and out of control long before they got to The Overlook.  

Edit: As expected this garnered quite a bit of attention.  First, Kubrick is one of the greats, 2001, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, an amazing director.  That being said, Mick Garris and King did a pretty solid job given the constraints of making a TV mini-series on what was a very strict budget.  Yes, hardly ""Oscar"" worthy performances around, but Courtland Mead was only cringey inselect moments of the film.  Danny Lloyd was hardly a prodigy child actor himself with his creepy little finger Tony moments ""There is no Danny only Zuul"".  Simple put, Kubrick made the better film, King told the better story.&&I don’t really understand how this is going to work.  There are entire sections of the book that deal more with Lil Torrance struggling with alcohol and addiction rather than struggling with the paranormal.. not really something your average moviegoer might expect from a new Shining movie.  

I am kind of interested as to how they plan to deal with the psychic battles.. in all honesty when I read the book I kind of had a ‘South Park: Cartman’s Special Gift’ image in my mind where these groups of psychic warriors exit their RVs and stand in a parking lot engaging in psychic warfare that no one else can see or experience but them.

Godammit, Akiva Goldsmith?  Really?  I’m going to make an early prediction and say that he’s going to focus on the ‘Chosen One’ elements of the book.  He really seems to like those plot points.  I mean, he retconned all of the original ‘the Ring’ movies so that he could turn Samara into a video editing psychic ghost that is sending encrypted messages on her tapes in hope of finding her Chosen One to take her place at the bottom of the well.  Not any person or any girl, but THAT specific non-descript 20-something college co-ed.&&Hello there&&erehT olleH, lleW&&As long as he's Obi Wan in standalone film I don't care what he does &&I read ""Ewan McGregor to star in"" and just about shat myself.

This better not conflict with his destiny to reprise the role of Obi for the Kenobi standalone. &&The only issue I have with this is the same issue anyone has with a book they love.  Dr. Sleep is in my opinion one of Stephen Kings greatest novels.  That's aside from the fact that's it's a sequel which makes it even more impressive.

The screenwriter and the source material don't appeal to me much, but the director has some solid genre work under his belt, and I doubt in this case King or King fans would kind a sharp departure from the book.

Director: Mike Flanagan ('Oculus', 'Ouija: Origine Of Evil', 'Before I Wake')

Writer: Akiva Goldsman ('The Dark Tower', 'King Arthur', 'Rings', 'Insurgence', Paranormal Activity')

Adding McGregor to the mix is a good sign though. Also Flanagan did do 'Gerald's Game' last year.&&Wasn't there vampires of something in the book?&&I'm assuming you read the book?  How was it?&&Yes because typically if something is not broken you dont touch it. This is just a money grab.&&Agreed. At no point either did I ever feel like the good guys *weren’t* going to win. &&The villains were just too absurd to be scary. &&You *RUUUBE*&&I feel like he showed glimpses of how terrifying they could be.  Remember when they tortured that kid, and had that fang or whatever?  But that was pretty much the only point they ever seemed scary.  The rest of the time they seemed like decrepit old folks in RVs....which they basically were. &&Absolutely awful. It didn't feel like they could really exist. When the hotel owner from The Shining (can't remember his name right now) showed up in the shed at the end was much more terrifying than any of the moments with those guys.

Edit: wording&&They were.  They were a totally superfluous and unneccesary addition to the story.

King should have focussed on the core theme of the story - alcoholism and the repression of memories.  Just stick to that and have the main conflict be about Danny vs the spirits from the hotel that he has to let out, confront and defeat so he can get clean.  Everything else was  a distraction.

One of Kings worst botch job of recent years along with End Of Watch.&&A lot of SK's villains are really bad. I haven't actually read this book so I don't know what sort of characters they are, but his worst bad guys are the ones he tries to make out of ""real"" people rather than fantasy/horror figures. 

Then again, I thought Greg Stillson in King's novel *The Dead Zone* was the worst, most unrealistic antagonist that he'd ever written. I thought so right up until 2016. So maybe I'm wrong about some of his other villains.&&They were really awful. They were like characters I would have come up with in middle school (and I would have thought they were so cool and ~quirky then). That and the last battle were pretty bad. [(I don't know how well that will translate to screen, it was literally just two people standing there *thinking* at one another, I mean...)](/spoiler)&&Yeah,compared to the rest of his antagonist the group of old people weren't quite as terrifying&&The thumbnail fooled me seeing Solo in the background so of course I jumped to conclusions without reading the headline&&They are probably going to sit on that a bit longer than expected because of Solo flopping. &&Any minute now.&&Here's Obi!&&General Kenobi&&All work and no rank of master makes Ani a dull boy. &&""Did you ever hear the tragedy of Jack Torrance?""&&Hello there&&Hello there&&With the thumbnail and the beginning of the title, I was 100% sure this was the Obi-Wan movie being announced.&&this is where the puns begin&&I always thought of someone like Eva Green&&Probably Helena Bonham Carter. 

Hopefully whoever is cast can make her a bit creepier than the book did &&When I read the book I always pictured her as Cate Blancette or someone similar. Especially when she played Katharine Hepburn for some reason. &&I read the book last year and imagined Famke Jannsen. Not sure if she would be the best but that's what appeared in my head.&&Could absolutely picture Rosamund Pyke, or maybe Charlize Theron?&&A Jedis strength flows from the Shining&&Yippee&&Yup&&It's over, father! I have the Overlook!&&>Also, in General Kenobi

FTFY&&> Nicholson looked crazy and out of control long before they got to The Overlook

Which was intentional, I understand that it is a departure from the book both thematically and plotwise, but I don't think that was necessarily a bad change for the story they wanted to tell with the movie. &&>	these groups of psychic warriors exit their RVs and stand in a parking lot engaging in psychic warfare that no one else can see or experience but them.

No matter how serious a movie is, if they include something like this, I wouldn’t be able to contain my laughter. Scenes like this is why a lot of books need to be changed when they are being made into films. A lot of things just don’t translate well from pages into frames. &&General Kenobi! &&The angel from my nightmare&&!iboneK lareneG&&You mean, 'Ewan Mcgreggor', he must be some other undiscovered Scottish actor, not our Obi-Wan. 

And so help me God if they don't spring for the budget to get MacGregor in the Obi-Wan movie I don't want to see it.

Do you hear that Disney? do whatever it takes!!! get him!

Disney Disney Disney Disney. Do it.&&A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.&&It’s getting close though&&r/prequelmemes: We are the Reddit!&&John Cusack really needs a good role to bring him out of the B-Movie rut he's in.

He's stuck down there with Bruce Willis & John Travolta.&&I love Cusack in a Stephen King movie, I do, but I think Ewan's a better choice. That being said, and unpopular opinion checking in here I'm sure, I don't think the book is worth a movie. About halfway through I felt like I just knew where it was going and I put it down. It just lacked all of his usual grip-me-to-the-page for me... Well, this and Under the Dome, do we speak of that book?



Edit: spelling&&General Kenobi!&&Man I thought I was the only one in this thread that liked Doctor Sleep. It's one of my favorite books by a mile, and I can never decide if I like The Shining or Doctor Sleep better.&&I'd watch that&&Dr Sleep is nothing like the Shining, story wise. It does tie in with the original story but it’s definitely it’s own thing.&&This is going to be a major issue.  The Shining novel is VERY different from The Shining film  However the average joe on the street knows more about the film.  Trying to make a sequel to Kubrick is insanity.  &&General Kenobi!&&General Kenobi!&&General Kenobi!&&Trab pu kcip &&General Kenobi!&&General Kenobi!&&What happened?&&Good idea, that way we can't be disappointed because there's no way this can be worse than that mini-series.&&He said in a way King would hate it, not me...&&Considering Kubrick's adaptation is both famously HATED by Stephen King and an incredibly classic film, there's at least a chance that he will hate elements of it.

However I'd love to see no refernces really to the Kubrick film, and then to have The Shining come out as a ""prequel"" starring Bryan Cranston as Jack.&&> Youtube influencers

Is that the new ""Reality TV star""?&&I'm upvoting this because ""...guy from Wings again"" gave me a nice flashback to being a kid in the '90's stuck at home during Summer break in Florida watching Wings re\-runs on the USA channel. There's no way I could have fully understood the humor, but I loved it regardless and may or may not have had a crush on Crystal Bernard (the blonde).&&Honestly though, I LOVE that version. It's true to the book, and the I do love Steven Weber. I think his acting was awesome in this. It's way more emotional, suspenseful and just overall awesome.

I wish more people knew about it &&Sure, except for Shawshank, Carrie, It, Stand by Me, Green Mile, and Pet Sematary.

I might be forgetting another one or two. Cujo maybe.

e: Dolores Claiborne and Misery, sorry Kathy Bates&&I like Renner and Evans a lot but I just can't see him in that role. Maybe their marvel roles are overshadowing them but I just can't see them doing creepy. &&How?? I dont picture him at alllllllll. i dont think he fits Dan a single bit. and tbh none of those people do.&&That's always a good strategy.&&I thought Renner was excellent in ‘Wind River’&&Matt Smith does well in creepy roles.&&He had the higher ground you might say. &&That’s why he’s there.&&What does the golden star ☝mean?&&Fuck. Yes. &&I'm not sure if Matt Smith could pull off rough alcoholic as well &&I agree, people seem to underestimate him somehow, but he’s a really versatile actor. That would’ve been just as interesting as McGregor—not to say I’m not pumped for this, but every time McGregor is signed onto a movie/confirmed for something that isn’t an Obi Wan stand-alone, I weep a little bit internally. &&Are you saying Ewan McGregor isn't attractive? Those are fightin words, Chef.&&-Todd Howard&&If watch the shit out of that crossover&&Gerald's Game, Hush, and his Ouija sequel were praised but yeah not really excited for Akiva Goldsman &&>Akiva Goldsman

ohhh nooooo.....&&Why is Goldsman still hired? He has been behind countless huge bombs and nobody has critically praised his work since the early 2000s and those movies were outliers in his filmography.

If I continually botched projects and turned in shit work I’d be fired from my job. &&Flanagan has a proven track record. Go back to his earlier movies and you'll see a consistency in understanding his craft.

Its the source material that concerns me though. Doctor Sleep is a strange choice for an adaptation.&&>Writer: Akiva Goldsman ('The Dark Tower')

That crushed me. It was the movie I'd most looked forward to, possibly ever. The trailers made me realize it would never live up to what I wanted it to be.

So one day, months later, I thought it would at least be good for a curiosity-watch at home. I smoked a bowl and got some nachos and drinks lined up, hit play, and couldn't get past the first 15 minutes it was so bad. Namely...the writing, and how it had been butchered past recognition and turned into a YA novel.

If it was unwatchable high, then I feel deeply for those unfortunate enough to be stuck *sober* in the movie theater watching it.

Fuck Akiva Goldsman.&&Mike Flanagan is pretty good&&I donno if having mcgregor is a good sign or not. Dark tower had Mathew mcaunahey and Idris Elba, fucking pure gold!!! And then they wrote a script that compressed 7 massive books into one and then they passed the script over to new writers that didn’t know much about the story and they passed that script to new writers that only knew what the script told them and they wrote a new script off that and then they passed that along to some peeps in Europe whose only knowledge of the dark tower was this POS script sent to them and they had to write a script and that’s the movie they made. Fucking cunts! And then they go and make an amazing IT and it’s like “ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS MAKE THE FIRST BOOK A FUCKING MOVIE!!!! That’s it, you could have been on par with Harry Potter and marvel for fucks sakes” and no I’m not passionate about this at all those cock sucking fuckers fucked it up so ducking bad. &&>Writer: Akiva Goldsman ('The Dark Tower')

Yeah I won't be seeing this one&&oh no I didn’t know Goldsman was writing it. But Flanagan is a pretty good director, although I haven’t seen Before I Wake which I heard was a bit iffy, but everything else he has done is solid (specifically Gerald’s Game which was awesome). &&
>Writer: Akiva Goldsman

Hopefully it's more A-Beautiful-Mind Akiva Goldsman rather than everything-else-he-wrote Akiva Goldsman&&Akiva has to be one of the weirdest successes out there. He's had a handful of well received films and a mountain of absolute shit. Yet even his shit films almost always make money. &&Flanagan is great.  Oculus, Hush, Ouija: Origins of Evil, and Gerald's Game are all great/excellent movies.

Why do you mention him like he's a negative?&&I've really enjoyed Mike Flanagan's approach to the horror genre thus far, I'm really excited he's onboard for this creepy King novel...&&No love for Oculus? I thought it was great tbh &&Oculus was one of the best horror movies in the last ten years&&Mike Flanagan is a great horror director. Just have to hope Goldsman fucks off somehow&&Mike Flanagan is a great director. Akiva Goldsman writes some good scripts and he writes some shitty scripts. Hopefully this will be one of his good ones. &&Wow talk about a mixed bag. Flanagan has been great. Especially with Ouija 2 being way way better than anyone expected (since the first is pure garbage). Akiva Goldsman sucks. He just sucks. How the fuck does he keep getting work is anyone’s guess. I place the failure of Dark Tower at his feet as well as the HDTGM Classic Winters Tale. 

Hopefully this can overcome Goldsman. &&What would you say if I told you that Ouija: Origin of Evil isn’t a horrible movie?&&I feel Oculus was underrated. It exceeded my expectations for a low budget horror movie. The name was probably the worst thing about it. &&I thought Oculus was pretty good. Freaked me out a fair amount.&&The Shining is the last movie that needs a sequel. It's never gonna be better than the Original, ffs. &&Yes. And no. 

But mostly yes - the new ""evil"" introduced is something along those lines and it's one reason why this movie will be very interesting. Between the movie and original text, which story will it follow?

They are similar enough so that they can keep things common to both I guess. 

If the studio has *IT* fever and is looking to capitalize on a *The Shining* sequel ...well, there are a lot of ways that it can become a  *Dark Tower* poopfeast than a success like *IT*. 

Please forgive the lack of confidence, but I hope that Rose the Hat doesn't become as comical as *The Dark Tower*'s treatment of Randall Flagg. I love Matthew McConaghey but the last thing I associate with The Man in Black is ""Well alright alright alright.""

Etc.

Also, Wooderson forever. #lovethoseredheads

&&Something along the lines of Stephen King's Night Flier.&&I loved the continuation of the story. 

There were parts that had me smiling ear to ear, parts that had me wondering WTF King was thinking as he introduced the new conflict and it was capped off with an ending that I could not possibly have found more satisfying. 

Ultimately I was in the minority with my King-fan friends who seemed to universally hate *Dr Sleep*, but they are all rabid fans of the movie over the original text and it's just not the same tale. 

Hit or miss, it seems, as with anything. &&It was weird as shit and not my favorite king book.&&Weird. &&I liked it. But I also liked ""Revival"", so...&&Not OP, listened to the audiobook recently though.

""Weird"" is right, as everyone else says. The thing I loved about The Shining was that it was a cohesively thrilling story that wasn't just about the scares, but it was a story about alcoholism and the effect it has on families. It's not just shallow jump scares, but true psychological horror that slowly builds over time. It had a definite ""meaning"" to it and that theme was ever present, and gave you lots of food for thought.

Doctor Sleep, on the other hand, is just not anywhere near as well-thought-out. It was certainly tolerable and had its interesting moments but the one thing it was lacking, to me, was a proper *theme*. It has cartoonish villains that don't really seem to represent anything, and the only major conflict in the story related to character development is more or less resolved in the opening chapters (Daniel not following in the footsteps of his father, vowing to be a better man).

IMO it's really nothing more than fanservice for people obsessed with The Shining. It makes a boatload of references to the original but it plays out a lot more like an adventurous family blockbuster movie but with gore. Not so much a true successor to The Shining at all, in spirit or in quality.

Hearing who's behind making this adaptation makes me even less hopeful that it will end up good... Book was a light 3/5 and a definite disappointment for me, but not entirely terrible. Just overly fan-focused instead of trying to build off of what made the original book so great.&&*Laughs in Avengers*

X FORCE ROLL OUT&&oh, /spoilers for a book that came out 4 years ago.

I actually wondered whether we weren't supposed to feel sorry for the bad guys.  I mean, they were evil and needed to be destroyed, but at no point did they actually put any of the characters in jeopardy.  They just got their asses kicked repeatedly and that was the book.  &&Yup and turning The Shining into a substance they could store in containers was midichlorians-level terrible.&&I dunno, the woman appearing at Abra's window (in a vision, I guess?) is straight out a childhood night-terror.

That said, compelling villains were never King's strong suit.&&Listened to the audiobook. Will Patton saying, ""You ruuuube,"" gave me chills.&&He called them tusks. I'll be interested to see how the movie portrays them, actually. I don't seem to be as traumatized by the villains from this book as others. Maybe King could have blended in more ghost or spirit-like characters to make it more closely related to The Shining, but I enjoyed it. &&>totally superfluous and unnecessary

I see what you did there&&Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers were so awesome..but End of Watch was painful for me to get through :(&&I really liked both of those books. Adding a supernatural touch to End of Watch and Holly's experience led perfectly into The Outsider.&&Having just read The Dead Zone, I can see how Greg Stillson would have been unbelievable in the past but I was just amazed at how he was able to so accurately predict that kind of politician rising to become president.&&You see the S2 finale of Legion?&&What, like the end of *scanners*?&&If Ewan Mcgregor does play Obiwan in the Obiwan movie Reddit will have a collective orgasm.

Not that I can blame them. I’d have one too &&I had the same exact train of thought. Not to say this isn't a cool casting, but oof really thought they finally announced it&&Why? The announcement of this movie alone would have a bigger opening weekend than Solo &&It seems in their anger /r/PrequelMemes killed the Obi-Wan movie.&&I smell crossover film.&&No&&I came to this topic for prequel memes.

I'm stoked regardless&&That's pretty good casting.  Has to be really attractive but also evil.&&Thats who I pictured when I read it. In Fight Club. &&This is who I had in mind. My only concern with HBC is that will she be playing a toned down version of Bellatrix.  Thoughts?&&The shining is just midichlorians.&&You are a perfect one&&Book = Normal man going crazy

Bruce Willis and Travolta are royalty with cheese.&&And Cage&&You are a bold one!&&Pick up bart. Pick up bart&&MEW was also married to her teenage sweetheart. Riley Stearns. He directed Faults. I like the guy and feel super bad for him. 

And yeah, leaving your wife of 20+ years that you have 3 children with, specifically for someone 14 years younger than you? Not a good look. &&He left his wife of several years and children for Ms Winstead on the set of Fargo. &&Mr. King... is that you? &&Don’t worry. King will hate you either way!&&Fine, make it ultra political YouTube influencers&&Stephen King also liked the movie adaptation of The Dark Tower. I feel like him disliking a movie adaptation is a good sign.&&Bryan Cranston is great, but King imagined someone more like Chris Reeve playing Jack. A super charismatic, clean\-cut type. It was supposed to make his descent into madness all the more jarring. From the first scene in Kubrick's Shining, I knew Nicholson was crazier than a shithouse rat. Chris Evans would be great.&&I'd personally rather not see The Shining be remade.&&I love the miniseries as well. Really the only thing I have against it is the fact it was a TV miniseries and it *really* shows. The special effects were cheap as fuck and aged like milk and the direction in general was a bit lackluster. I love it mostly for being an infinitely more faithful adaptation than the 1980 film, because the book really deserved it. The Kubrick film still stands as one of my favorite movies of all time, but the fact it's based on the King novel is literally the least of its appeal for me. Hell, it's *known* that Kubrick went out of his way to subvert the source material and twist it into what he wanted, which directly contributed to King's hate of the film and caused him to take a much more direct role in future adaptations.&&and The Mist&&Have you seen Renner in Wind River or American Hustle? He can play a lot more than just Hawkeye.&&Renner played Jeffrey Dahmer in [Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahmer_\(film\)) lol&&Chris Evans in Snow Piercer won me over as a fan&&I don’t think it’s their Marvel roles. I think for a role like this you just get a lot of good actors going for it and the best one suited for the role was cast. Those two still get plenty of roles Marvel aside.&&I'm not going to speak to Renner or Evans' abilities to do creepy, but I do think they'd also be great for the role. Danny Torrance in Doctor Sleep ~~isn't going to~~ *shouldn't* be creepy.

I mean, the movie could be a strong departure from the book, the way Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining was, but if it follows the basic story at all, then he's going to be a reluctant... hero's not quite the right word.

Nuanced? Sure. Deeply troubled? Absolutely. Creepy? No, but there are plenty of characters in this story that will be.

I'm really looking forward to this, but I'm also cautiously optimistic. The Shining and Doctor Sleep are two very different types of stories, tied together almost entirely by one character. Danny's experiences in the first are a perfect setup for his involvement in the second, but honestly if he wasn't Danny Torrance in Doctor Sleep but rather someone else with just a similar past, the story would still be great. If the people making this film understand what makes this story able to stand on its own, and use that, then they can make an amazing film. If they try too strongly to tie it to The Shining (because they think the audience will like it or something, whatever gets into studios heads when they make crap sequels) then it will be a huge disappointment.&&Evans can act as well Snowpiercer and Gifted were pretty good movies&&Another happy landing &&That's a good trick&&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one &&He’s great in everything. Especially the Hurt Locker &&Renner is arguably tied for best actor there. &&I’m still waiting for a real meaty breakout role that’s not the Doctor for Matt Smith. I think he’s got the chops if he gets a solid part!&&*The Town* as well&&All of those actors are good, but Ewan McGregor is basically the next generation's Tom Hanks or Liam Neeson.  Every A-list actor in Hollywood is where they are because they can act.  Ewan McGregor is the kind of actor who makes most of the rest of them look like amateurs. && Surprising comment, but a welcomed one&&Someone gave them reddit gold for that comment.&&Have you seen him play Philip ?&&We all know him as the 11th doctor.  
Optimistic, chilidish, mad and enthusiastic. And he was brilliant, but no-one's gonna suggest him for completely different roles until he has proven his versatility first. To many of us he already did that with the crown where he was great aswell.&&Ewan is more classy hot. Evans is more hunky hot. Renner just has a weird face that's somehow attractive. &&I'm more referring to the Marvel physiques those two have, Danny Torrance ain't the sort of guy who spends time at the gym...&&I think he means ripped and bulky rather than hot.&&He's not ""hunky"". He's... I dunno. Beautiful?

Certainly not the masculine ""hero"" type though. He's too ethereal for that.&&This guy high grounds. &&Yup, almost everything Goldsman touches turns to crap.&&The Dark Tower movie was absolute trash. &&Don't forget Flanagan also did Gerald's Game, proving he can do a fantastic King adaptation.

So while Goldsman may be a downer, I'm still confident with Flanagan at the helm. And he's never directed a movie he didn't have a direct hand in writing so I'm expecting him to rewrite Goldsman's script.&&I couldn't really complain about his direction of Oculus either, it just had weak writing. Which Goldsman is renowned for, ugh.&&Hush was the one w the deaf lady right? Not the ""Hush"" that A Quiet Place borrowed their concept from?&&I was skeptical about this fella's resume until you mentioned Hush. That is, by far, one of my top ten favorite movies. I'm a little more hopeful for Dr. Sleep to go well.&&Gerald’s game was my favorite movie last year. Pure brilliance if you ask me, and that’s another king adaptation so I actually do have some hope.&&Fuck me. Any chance we could get *A Beautiful Mind* and *Cinderella Man* Akiva Goldsman?&&aaaaaaand I'm out.&&I thought Winter's Tale was gonna be the one to do his career in but he just keeps on coming!&&Nepotism. Hollywood thrives on it.&&Because finishing a coherent script is a lot harder than people give screen writers credit for. Doing it on a time constraint while taking studio notes and requirements into consideration even more so.   If someone can do all that AND make it a fantastic script, they become a legend. Akiva consistently does everything except the last.

He’s not an auteur like Charlie Kauffman. He doesn’t write the scripts he wants to write. He’s a workhorse that does what’s asked of him. There’s  always value in that.

Faint praise,I admit. Here’s to hoping Flanagan (whose work I appreciate) does as many rewrites as he sees fit. &&He must have some serious #metoo type blackmail on some powerful studio executives or something.&&The Dark Tower is my favorite book series, and I saw that shit sober as a duck.

My soul's ass still hurts from the reaming it gave me.&&I will never watch that movie for fear it would destroy my love for the series&&Preach&&It's spoken like someone who hasn't actually watched Flanagan's films or knows who he is.  Shame it's so highly upvoted.  Flanagan is a legit genre talent.  I'd put him up there with  Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, Ti West, David Sandberg & Adam Wingard. If any of those names are attached to a project, I'm *immediately* interested.&&The direction and editing of OCULUS is top notch. &&> I love Matthew McConaghey but the last thing I associate with The Man in Black is ""Well alright alright alright.""

Have you seen True Detective season 1? I didn't see the Dark Tower so I dunno if he sucked in it, but ""Well alright alright alright"" isn't the only thing he can do. &&I hope they cast Eva Green as Rose the Hat. That's how I kept picturing the character in my head, personally.&&>There were parts that had me smiling ear to ear, parts that had me wondering WTF King was thinking

So...a Stephen King book, got it. &&I loved it. My biggest problem with the film is that the general audiences going to see it will think of Kubrick's version, rather than King's. The book's text makes it *abundantly clear* that it only follows the account of the previous book and disregards the film entirely. For the sake of not confusing audiences, they *should* go with a film sequel rather than a book sequel. But the film didn't leave much wiggle room for a sequel at all, let alone one as narratively satisfying as Doctor Sleep has the potential to be. &&They were so incredibly weak tho and they were getting weaker. They'd just kidnap kids and torture them. That makes them evil but not really scary evil because oh the good guys can beat them with a fucking stick&&Can you elaborate more on what you mean by compelling? Just trying to understand what you're saying.&&Lol.  My bad.&&I didnt even finish it.  Tried three times.  I think that was a King first for me, not finishing.&&I read his name and ""to play"" and my dick moved a little, then disappointed, then Oh shit! they're making Dr. Sleep&&Where do you think you are right now?&&The Boba Fett film being announced first is a travesty.&&It's a standalone movie about a younger version of an existing iconic character. I still think it's going to happen, but now might not be the best time to announce a similar movie. Or maybe the script isn't ready and they haven't nailed down a firm release date.&&It's treason then&&(Visable confusion)&&I sense Dooku.&&I thought not. It's not a story Danny would tell you.&&I remember her being described as stunningly beautiful. Her character wasn't ""grungy"" and dark looking, which made her brutality a real contrast. Been five years since I read it.&&I pictured Eva Green.&&Movie was more like unhinged man going straight up crazy. &&We'll see if he actually gives a shit in regards to acting in Glass. He hasn't put effort into a performance in a long time.&&Yeah but like 5 of his last 6 are all direct to streaming b action movies. Like Segal level shit&&Cusack's an asshole?&&Ah man, that sucks. I really loved that he was married to a non-celebrity woman and then he turned into a Hollywood cliche (falling for a younger co-star). Shame.&&Mr. King... I don't feel too good. &&It tends to be. His personal adaptation of The Shining was only good for one thing. It was a shining example (pun intended) of how religiously sticking to the source material when adapting a book is a bad idea, because some things work well on page but not one screen and vice versa.&&""liked"" read ""enjoyed heft of sack full of money""&&Interesting. And yet, Lawnmower Man happened.&&[deleted]&&God damn wind river was good&&Or The Town? &&There's an episode of the TV show House where he plays a dying musician and Renner is fucking fantastic.  To the point where I had to check the credits and find out his name so I could see what other roles this talented actor had played, which is something I don't often do.

Shortly after he ended up in Hurt Locker and his career blew up.  I sometimes wonder if Kathryn Bigelow (director of Hurt Locker) had seen the episode of House and thought she needed to cast Renner, or at least audition him for a part in her movie.  Before that he was probably best known for a part in National Lampoon's Senior Trip, a role which didn't exactly start the world on fire.&&I didn't mean to imply he could only do hawkeye, he has range but he seems like he has an inherent everyman quality rather than the weird creepy vibe the shining needs.&&Renner was also Jeffrey Dahmer&&He played Jeffrey Dahmer, as well, and was pretty creepy.&&He did also play Jeffery Dahmer so I think he can do creepy. &&God that movie scared me. I can never unsee him as Dahmer&&Yeah Evans is the only one who doesn’t really fit lol&&""Mom, the prequel memes are leaking again""&&I came for the prequel memes, I was not disappointed. &&Yipeee!&&You are a bold one.&&Another happy ~~landing~~ casting. 

&&Hello there!&&Hello there&&Except irl. There’s talk that he’s a jackass&&I can’t believe I had to come this far down to find Hurt Locker. He was fantastic. &&I did not enjoy him in Bourne. &&Hmmmm, I'm not sure he quite has the same range, at least in my opinion. Both are good though, no doubt. I feel Ewan ""disappears"" into a role better than Renner.&&He was great in The Crown&&> Ewan McGregor is basically the next generation's Tom Hanks

cmon man he is good, but are you fucking serious?

we may never get another tom hanks

he has no equal yet&&Liam Neeson?&&How are Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson at the same level as Tom Hanks?&&I have not. I'm guessing he does pull it off? &&Idk, I see him as Prince Phillip pretty easily nowadays.&&He was praised for his performance as Patrick Bateman in the American Psycho stage adaptation.&&True, but there was also that ballistic Gosling flick (look at my muscles), what was it called? He was wild in that! The man has chops. &&Optimistic, chilidish, mad and enthusiastic. 

But then you watch the Good men dont need rules speech and hes none of that.&&Renner would be pretty average looking if he wasnt a celebrity.

People tend to forget that a lot of how we judge peoples physical attractiveness is context.&&http://www.redrumgym.com/&&True that. He is supposed to be attractive though. I read the book not that long ago and he is supposed to look like his dad. Jack was handsome so I pictured Danny as handsome too.&&Flanagan always writes his movies so I'm hoping that he's gonna rewrite Akiva's draft&&Yet they almost all make money. He's been continually rewarded for terrible movies. That and he did write a few really good ones as well.&&Ahhh the reverse Midas touch. Anyway, I’m not giving anybody (excluding the actors) who had anything to do with the dark tower movie my money. I was so excited and the actors played their roles great for such a pile of garbage. &&They should've made a DT movie with the same team that made ""It"". I felt It was way closer to the DT books as far as overall tone and the design aesthetic of the nightmare creatures. Actually, I would be okay with a franchise series of King movies made under the direction of a stellar creative team (say Guillermo Del Toro or Weta, or something), which all connect MCU style, culminating in a Dark Tower trilogy.&&The first thing I mentioned *was* Gerald's Game lol&&That's the one. His wife was the star. The tension in that movie was great.&&Yes, you're correct.
&&That Akiva Goldsman is long gone.&&— He didn't write those movies. Someone bought the scripts and he cleaned them up for the studios. 
&&Whaaaaat? Winter’s Tale was great. 

It’s was supposed to be a comedy right?&&That wouldn’t have had any weight a couple years back before it all blew up, so doesn’t explain his career through most of his weaker period. &&Long days and pleasant nights *ass*. &&Since you mentioned him, I really love some of Wingard’s work which makes it’s a damn shame that the 2 films for him to catch major attentions were not his best (Blair Witch and Death Note). But The Guest and his previous work are amazing to me. &&Agreed and it's impossible to be more enthusiastic in agreement. 

His character and dialogue in TD is magnificent. That was a breakout role for me - the [comment on fatherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAGbNL9Y5E4) alone stands out as one of many standout performances in an insanely good show. 

I know I'm selling him short and I know I'm wrong for it, but I just couldn't shake the Wooderson thing in *Dark Tower* and it did not raise itself in True Detective. 

It's absolutely my deficiency and I admit it wholeheartedly. &&You’re forgetting Dallas Buyers Club&&Th script for the dark tower is what sucked. Compressing 7 books into a movie and calling it “the next turn of the wheel” and then just jacking off in sanfrisco like there’s no tomorrow. The people that wrote the final scripts only knowledge of the dark tower was the 3rd revision of the original script. They should have just made the Gunslinger and then make books 2 and 3 the tv series and then four could have been the next movie which could almost be made as a continuation of the gunslinger as it’s about Roland as teen, then more tv series as they oringally planned and then the last book a movie or some shit. &&> an ending that I could not possibly have found more satisfying.

Does not compute /s&&Have you tried 'From a Buick 8' ? I don't hate that book but it was such a slog to get through, it took me months.&&Is this not Wikipedia?&&People are saying Solo, Fett, and the Kenobi movies could be a trilogy, with the Cameo at the end of Solo sort of being the overall antagonist which might actually work pretty nicely&&Okay yeah but *no one* asked for a Solo movie&&Maybe they want a Director attached? Mangold would've been pretty good tho. &&I sense a trap&&Danny Torrance was a shiner, so wise and so powerful, he could even keep the ones he cared about from killing him.&&I remember that. They were sucking the shine out of people I believe and that made them young and full of vigor. I wouldn't be interested in a character already in shit shape. I thought she got grungy from withdrawals of not getting the shine. At that point she can go from Charlize Theron in almost all her movies to Charlize in Monster.&&I thought he tried enough with Moonrise Kingdom! &&He tried to finance his own sci-fi movie he was actually passionate about. During some press he mentioned that no one would put him in a movie unless his name was McClane or he had a Gun. I think this was right around GI Joe 2.

He actually seemed pretty down and out about it. 

&&We watched it happen to our fathers’ action stars and now we see it happen to ours. Imagine all the Marvel Chrises in direct to digital crapfests in 15 years!&&Cusack seems lovely. I was Just quoting the great Gil Faison. &&Met him at a convention last year. He wasn't very friendly.&&r/unexpectedthanos&&Well, I think the larger issue was that it was a TV movie and not on premium cable or a film adaptation (not that *The Dark Tower* is an example to follow on great King film adaptations...). The performances were sometimes downright cringeworthy and being restricted by what was allowed on TV was doing this no favors. 

I think that Steven Weber did better when he was allowed to run wild as Jack but Rebecca DeMornay and the kid were atrocious in their performances (10/10 DeMornay hotness though!). 

I think the straight from the page adaptation could probably work if you had a good screenwriter attached (dear sweet baby Jesus, keep Akiva Goldsman away!!!) and a competent director you could get, at least, a good film adaptation. 

Though I would think that no film adaptation going forward is going to compare to Kubrick's film. While I think that King's resentment of Kubrick's script is fair, since its loosely based on King's alcohol dependence and the Kubrick movie shies away from that as a factor in Jack's insanity, I don't think you're going to get anything new to compare to the greatness of Kubrick's vision. &&The original source material for Lawnmower Man probably wouldn’t have translated well to the screen in its day. An interdimensional being who manifests as a naked gardener...I’m not sure that could even work on Netflix now let alone on TV in the 80s and 90s&&If memory serves me correctly, King took the studio to court to have his name removed from the title, as it was originally *Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man*. He *hated* this version too, as it had no input from King and was simply rights he sold to the studio. I think it was after this that he started to screen the people who wanted to adapt his works and let them use his stories for a dollar. &&Why are you flanking me?&&Upvote for Wind River.

> The longest I saw was 30 seconds. Our perception of: ‘You duck down behind the thing and I duck down over here and we shoot’, it doesn’t exist.

NOT KIDDING SPOILERS









--------------------

Because the movie was written by a damn expert who basically diverted the river of the movie's plot directly into that snap confrontation after a rollercoaster of tension buildup.

So this whole movie has been about figuring out the mystery of who killed this girl, and the protagonists are following up on a lead. They know they may have to contend with a bunch of dudes, so they actually round up a posse, wild west style. Tension increased. We see the leader of the drillers, who is blatantly lying about being hit by a branch, since he's clearly been punched multiple times. Tension increased. We get the hostility of the one deputy who is clearly spoiling for a fight. Tension. And then we see his paranoia is justified, as it certainly seems like those drillers were flanking them...and all have their guns out...and are all wearing body armor...tension tension tension. And just like that, with a really amazing cut on the trailer door, we get into the flashback.

The flashback has warm colors and a happy tone. That tension that was built up is released. You see a happy couple, two beautiful people enjoying a fun night together. And then the drillers come back, and the tension slowly ramps up again. They're being rowdy. Pete is being persistent in that way drunk people are. The man's appeals to the head driller are ignored. Things get more heated, and we see the crime play out. the man is helpless to stop the woman from getting raped and she is helpless to stop him from being beat to death. So, you have ostensibly a mystery movie about solving a crime stop 60% of the way through and show you the entire crime being committed with no coyness, no attempt to obfuscate who did it. This is where the movie does its judo redirection. The entire emotional weight of solving this crime, setting right the lives of the woman's parents, finding closure for Renner's character, Olsen's character proving her worth and trying to manage the situation, all of that comes crashing back with an intense amount of immediacy, because now that we've seen the flashback, we know more than the main characters. We know they are in grave danger. And we know they're juuuust on the cusp of figuring it out, because holy shit do we not remember the little mexican standoff? That JUST happened. We're basically told, just before the lightning strikes, that the lightning is going to strike and all of the emotional *through questions* of the movie are about to be answered, in the next like 5 seconds.

So you get the main character arcs of the movie coming to a head, the renewed tension of the standoff now that we know the true stakes, AND we're riding high off the heart-rending tension of the flashback and having watched powerless as these men destroyed lives. And now the movie just holds this impossibly high note of tension for so long as Olsen is maneuvered into position in front of the door.... and them blam, it's all happening faster than you can even think. 

The movie felt like it was made specifically to pull off this technique. Like instead of the technical stuff just being a vehicle for the script, it felt like the whole movie and story was plotted around choosing specifically this method for revealing it--tense situation, then flashback revealing the entire mystery, and then return to the tense situation with the audience now understanding the danger the characters are in more acutely than the characters. Then raise the tension just eeeeever so slightly more, then unload everything in a fast resolution. 

If you watch Wind River and aren't going whaaat the fuuuuuck oh my goooood after the shootout, then I'm surprised. &&You said it perfectly. Cause when they said that I was suddenly like “Wait what? What’s happening right now? Oh fuck.” Then it calms very shortly up until uh *SPOILER DONT READ AFTER THIS* Elizabeth Olsen gets shot at the door. Or was it a different cop? &&It was written by the same guy, who also wrote Sicario, except he directed Wind River too. It was his directorial debut. That's why I was comparing them. They have different plots and themes though. Wind River is a murder-mystery/thriller that has a good amount of emotional scenes.&&Definitely worth checking it out.  A bit bleak, but very good.&&It's outrageous, it's unfair! How can I be in the screenshot but not be a Memer?&&Take an upvote, young /u/Mesky1&&The one number that should've worked for the Dark Tower...but didn't.&&> 19

Ah, same amount of rewrites as the Dark Tower's Tomatometer %. What a respectful nod to Goldsman!&&All work and no play makes Flan a dull boy&&Haha, took me until about 1:30 in to realize it was looping.&&My hero, but seriously wtf @ that scene. Reminded me of the workout montage from hot rod&&Is that a fucking joke? He t-boned a tree but get rolling?&&It's a different director unfortunately. &&The director, DP, and composer are different, but it is still written by Sheridan. I like everything I’ve seen of his so far with Sicario, Wind River, and Hell or High Water. I’m worried too, but he seems to know what he’s doing.&&>security team

they were Delta Force, being the most Delta Forcey they could be. I loved it&&Hopefully, I'll forget this and finally get around to watching this.  It came and went too quickly last year.&&Well said.. Im a veteran and a police officer... And I was honestly shook after this movie... &&Take a seat young shitposter.&&Have you heard the story of Unidan the Orinthologist?&&No, the shots repeat themselves several times in the video so it looks like they're falling forever.

""Tom Holland Not Allowed More Than 20 Feet from Any Marvel Personnel""&&More important part of this article that peole are missing, I think it's the first that confirms Jake Gyllenhaal will play Mysterio. That's huge.

> Spider-Man: Far From Home also stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the classic Spider-Man villain Mysterio, and is written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers.&&I just assumed it was going to be called Spider-Man: Graduation Day.
&&I can’t wait for “Spider-Man 3: Not Quite Homecoming, But Not Too Far. Like An Hour Away”&&If Tom Holland revealed it, it probably means the studio didn't want anyone to know for 3 months. &&They’ve said the sequel takes place all over the world so it wouldn’t surprise me if this was the title. 

Also it seems like he was joking about there not being any new announcements and revealing the title at the same time. Kind of like a throwback for when he spoiled the Avengers poster but this time he was in on it. &&Spiderman: A Nu Start&&Cuz he's on Titan when the snap gets reversed. Right? RIGHT!?!??!&&Yeah he’s a pile of ashes on Titan that’s fairly far from New York&&I hope this entire thing is a set up for Secret Wars, even though the timeline is completely fucked.&&Spider Island?&&but Venom is the one far from home&&Anyone think this might be a placeholder title to not potentially spoil A4? It’s really ambiguous and fits where he’s at now. 

Not to mention that title is ass. I would hope they can come up with something better. &&Far From Home? 

That straight to video movie from the early 90’s about that kid who gets lost in the wild with his Labrador retriever? I remember seeing the trailer for that when watching The Power Rangers movie on VHS. Good stuff. 

&&>	The Far From Home title reflects that this will be the first Spider-Man solo movie to take the wallcrawler out of New York and put him in other parts of the world, such as London.

*Spider-Man: Sweet Home Alabama*

*Spider-Man: Take Me Home, Country Roads*

It’s like he just follows...oh.”&&*The Gang Goes to London*&&He is going to freakin' Tokyo and get his megazord.&&The movie is filming in London, Paris and Venice, so that explains it.&&I thought it would be cool if he materializes back on Titan and has to find a way home... maybe running into a certain symbiote on the way back...

Who am I kidding - it’s definitely him on a field trip.  Not that it would make it any less awesome, Spider-Man in a GotG style movie would feel weird.&&Can I tell you a dream of mine? Like, legitimately a dream I had years ago that I think about all the time.


Spiderman movie opens with the end of a battle between Spiderman and The Green Goblin. The battle ends when Mary Jane dies and Spiderman kills the green goblin out of rage. 

Then, Spiderman leaves. Parker then travels the world ala Benjamin Button during the middle years. He ends up in Africa and runs into Kraven, who is a poacher hunter in Africa. Kraven is trying to find those responsible for killing his wife, who was... 

Carnage. 


I know this isn't cannon, but fuck it because venom is its own thing now. But the symbiotes landed in the Congo. Venom takes over Eddie Brock, who is a reporter reporting on crimes against humanity in the Congo. Carnage takes over a psychopathic warlord of child soldiers. 


So you have Kraven, carnage, Venom, and Spiderman IN THE JUNGLE. 

Imagine Spiderman in the jungle. Imagine what he can do. 


This was/is my dream. &&Spider-Man 3: Homecoming 2&&I'm hoping for *Spider-Man: Country Roads, Take Me Home*.&&Spider Man 3: Pig In The City&&Spider-Man: Home Alone: Lost in New York&&Marvel’s gonna take a page from WW1984

I also thought it would be him appearing in Titan lol&&> Spider-Man in a GotG style movie would feel weird.

Isn't that basically what his role in Infinity War is?&&That sounds fucking amazing&&For a second I though carnage was kraven’s wife.&&Since Iron Man was in Homecoming, and people have started talking like every Spidey movie should have a similar-sized hero part for someone else from the MCU, I've always thought it would be fun to put Black Panther in a Kraven movie.

You'd have a sequence at the beginning where Kraven runs afoul of Panther, and one would follow the other to NYC (part of me thinks it makes most sense for Kraven to be pursuing Panther, continuing the hunt, but having Panther pursue Kraven when Kraven starts hunting Spidey gives them a reason to run into each other and have the Spidey/Panther team-up). So you'd at least have a Kraven/Panther sequence in the jungle.

But your idea is WAY better.&&> Imagine Spiderman in the jungle. Imagine what he can do.

Sony handles the promotion for the solo Spider-Man movies.  Thats part of the reason why the Homecoming trailers gave away the ending.

Or simply give an earlier date, like they did with the first Guardians.&&Snapped back....to reality oh- there goes gravity.&&I mean, imagine this:

We open on a pile of ashes on Titan. A stray web shooter reveals that this pile of ashes was *Spider-Man*. The chords of a heartbreaking melody begin. An echo in the distance: *...I don't feel so good Mr. Stark...* 

Heartbreaking music swells.

The wind picks up and starts blowing the ashes in a visually appealing swirl. The music turns ominous. Here we meet Spider-Dust's new nemisis: *rain*. 

The rain pelts our ashen hero as he swirls and attempts to dodge. The soundtrack is now upbeat and inspirational. Just when it looks like our hero will fail, and be completely sodden, he pulls through the other side of the squall, the rain slowly comes to a stop, and victory music swells. The wind blows Spider-Dust into the distance, triumphant.

Most people don't realize how distincitve voices are.
 I had a class reunion a couple years ago and there was a bald guy I had no idea who he was - until he opened his mouth and the voice made it completely clear despite it being over a decade.

In particular with somebody who has a mask like Spidey where the face isn't giving you hints the voice is a total tell.&&I gotta watch that movie again but was it just the voice that tipped him off? If so that's pretty darned impressive.&&Because he is Batman&&""Good old Spider-Man...""&&Michael Keaton does such an amazing job in that scene.

*No air. No sea. No land. Only spiders.*

We crawl over the bodies of one another. Suffocate against one anotherA dark, writhing mass. We eat one another for sustenance. We lay our eggs in the carcasses of the deceased. Life and death cycle as it can, the living spring from the dead to have their turn. We breed. We rot.

*No heat. No time. No space. Only spiders.*

Were a wayward, miraculous human scientist to somehow observe us, it could be speculated that our atoms and molecules resemble the mass of our whole selves. Were a wayward, miraculous human scientist to somehow speculate on our universe, the shape of it could be thought to have a large abdomen, and eight scampering legs. We are, everything is spiders.

The story centers on Jojo, a young boy who longs to be part of the Hitler Youth and whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. He discovers a Jewish girl living in his attic and, after initially trying to find ways to get rid of her, begins to see her as human.

**Starring:**

* Taika Waititi (as Adolf Hitler)
* Scarlett Johansson (as Resistance Fighter)
* Sam Rockwell (Hitler Youth Camp Captain)
* Thomasin McKenzie
* Rebel Wilson&&A small German boy playing JoJo, Scar Johansson as Iggy, Sam Rockwell as Polnareff...so excited for this!!! &&mildly disappointed it's not WW2 Jojo's Bizzare Adventure&&Sounds bizarre, but also quite the adventure.

Yes.

I've never wanted something more than I've wanted this.&&sam rockwell out here being typecast as a racist. never seen that before. &&Main character called Jojo with an imaginary friend.

Is this a Jojo reference?&&What a cool cast. This sounds promising. &&This looks really, really interesting! I'm so behind on comic book movies, but can someone give me an unbiased take on his Thor, and recommend other movies of his?  EDIT: I had no idea he's the same director as 'What We Do In The Shadows'! Ok, I'm sold. &&Rebel Wilson

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Especially since while I didn’t think the first 2 were all that bad, I wasn’t really a fan of the whole dark and gloomy feel of the whole movie which kind of stuck out against the rest of the MCU, almost like it was a DC movie. Ragnorok imo managed to still keep but perfectly balance the dark and gloomy plot with a brighter color shift and a bunch of different locations. And the action is really good, plot is solid, music is great, honestly the only thing I personally didn’t particularly like all that much was a little too much comedic relief at times, but it’s a really minor complaint as pretty much all the jokes landed for me. 

My favorite though would still be Ant-Man. I just love that movie so much regardless of the massive plot holes in the physics of the pym particle. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and is full of great jokes, the shrinking added a whole new element in what would have been another slightly different shaped cookie cutter superhero movie, and I’m a sucker for a romantic plot line. I also really like how he deals with issues in his personal life in the movie as well. Others in the MCU do too, but with Scott it feels a lot more relatable and personal in a way.

I did a lot of street team stuff while I was in high school and college for music labels, which was pretty much work for free and we’ll get you on the list to smaller shows type of thing. Well sometimes, some of the really no name bands would stay with my friends and I at our apartments as temporary housing while they were going through the area.

A few became moderately successful and I liked to reach out and send them the candid pics of when they were just hanging out and doing shit like trying Whataburger for the first time in their starting days.
&&Jemaine's face is always obscured&&Haha as a NZer I knew that was ghost chips without even clicking.. &&I'd like to point out that this particular accent is not the typical kiwi accent, but an accent pretty specific to South Auckland Maori and Pacific Islanders.

New Zealand is about the size of the UK and has diverse accents too (though nowhere near as many). They all sound closer to one another, likely due to the fact we're a very young country but there's clear differences.

A farmer from the South Island Canterbury has a pretty unique accent mainly due to the Scottish influence, people from the Wellington area tend to have the typical kiwi accent you're used to, and you'll often hear our politicians talk with it even if they're not originally from there. Aucklanders generally sound closer to Australian (sorry Auckland, but it's true) which is probably why people get us confused a lot, though it's still distinct emphasising U sounds instead of E sounds like Australia.

Out of all of them the accent in the video is probably the most unique and clearly differentiated from the rest.&&That dude looks like a kiwi Sasuke Uchiha&&Jokes aside, keeping someone from the wheel when they're drunk makes you an absolute unit.&&Hey bro, we’re about to jump in that panzer tank and invade Poland, wanna come?&&😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂&&What was the reference?&&I mean, that could be funny, but what would be the point? Just to make a simple Thor Ragnarok refrence? That’d feel hollow and cheap.&&Yea, nah. This whole contraption is like a deconstruction of that webcomic loss. But it's not a regular deconstruction of loss. More like a freaky anti-semetic loss.&&What about Krieger?

Oh, wait. He doesn't actually look like Hitler, now that you mention it...&&I am all Adolph Hitler portrayed by Waititi on this glorious day.&&Great character tho, and well depicted. 

I'm still not sure Stephen King and Frank Darabont are different people.

I'm torn here. She's been a train wreck in interviews of late and I absolutely have no interest in her career being dusted off for revival.

It was one of those Netflix teen movies, Molly played a mom and Keanu played himself, I can't remember what it was called. &&Hmm. I saw Molly in a recent film from 2016 or 2017. She was so awkward. Her voice was thready and sounded like it was going to crack. She said her lines very woodenly.

[Molly Ringwald](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/M7TPXB/new-york-usa-12th-mar-2018-molly-ringwald-in-attendance-for-molly-M7TPXB.jpg) hasn’t really held up as well as [Winona Ryder](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/89/0c/7c890c95ca64af735137763fea22ddfb.jpg) though.

It feels really forced to me. The diamond claw thing is too diamond-like to be a claw and too claw-like to be a diamond, and it’s not worked into the composition at all. It’s just kind of dragged and dropped into the frame. I’m genuinely surprised people think this is good.

Source: art director for 3 years, designer for 12.&&I think his character blows his brains out and the poster is foreshadowing it.&&[Reminds me of this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Will_Fall#/media/File%3ADjshadow2016album.jpg)&&That has nothing to do with it.

Look out!&&I think that everyone should go watch the original before they watch this remake. &&I see what u did there... &&Scrolled way to far for this &&It's Serbian isn't it?&&We're gonna need a story!&&What&&This comment makes perfect sense. Why the confused responses?&&Wait that does bring up an interesting point. For someone as universally loved as Keanu, what film has he shown his acting talent in? He’s without a doubt dedicated to his craft and I’m sure I’m just forgetting some but I can’t think of any.

EDIT: Looking over his IMDB, the Devils Advocate was pretty good

EDIT 2: Looks like Scanner Darkly is the winner&&[deleted]&&Honestly he actually can act, he just is more suited to the types of roles he has taken on recently.

&&Saw Won’t You Be My Neighbor here in Pittsburgh on Thursday night. Absolutely incredible, hands down the most emotional documentary I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend it!&&Went to an advance screening of Won't You Be My Neighbor. I have never seen that many people (myself included) sniffling and dabbing at their eyes as they filed out of the theatre. 

Great film, it deserves the acclaim. &&I met Bo Burnham once and told him I had been watching him since he was 14 in his bedroom on Big Boys. It felt pretty awkward to say out loud. &&I have such an undeserved feeling of pride whenever I see Bo Burnham having success. I loved watching his YouTube 
 channel and remember consistently checking to see if he uploaded a new song. Seeing him now, directing an award winning comedy, brings a tear to my eye. &&Just caught ""Won't you be my neighbor"" last night and loved it. I've seen critiques that its overly deferential to its subject and doesnt dive deeply enough in issues. But honestly in a time where ""feel bad"" entertainment is more popular than ever I felt the positive message and upbeat tone was actually a breath of fresh air and ultimately the riskier artistic choice.&&I was in middle school when Bo's first songs came out on Youtube and I remember watching them over and over again because they were so clever and funny. I've been a huge fan ever since. I've never met him but I'm still so proud of all that he has achieved. Good for Bo, yo. :')&&Just saw ""Eighth Grade"" (followed by a surprise Q&A with Bo and Elsie Fisher) a few minutes ago. Probably one of the best coming-of-age films ever, and definitely has the potential to be the film of this generation. It's such a pain-stakingly accurate portrayal of middle school in the modern era, and it cuts so deep especially for people who found themselves on the ""fringes of society"" and struggling to make their mark as a ""cool kid"". Full of awkward cringe humor but also has tons of heart.

&&Bo Burnham is my fucking dad&&Bo is such a talented guy, I can’t wait to see him in the future. I feel like he is going to be one of the great ones. &&I saw Elsie Fisher win her best actress award this morning and she is adorable! &&I'm so happy for Bo. From making YouTube videos in his room to directing acclaimed films. What a journey so far, and he's still so young. I hope he has a long, exciting career&&I want to see Won’t You Be My Neighbor, but unfortunately don’t live near a cinema that plays it. 

It sucks because I would love to support it and do my part to help bring documentaries into mainstream cinema. &&Can’t freaking wait for Eighth Grade. Bo is one of my all time favourite comedians, and seeing his directorial debut gain this amount of praise warms my heart. &&Saw it last night. Glad it won best film, although I was to lazy to vote for it. The Q&A afterwards was awesome too. They were both engaging and funny speakers.

It's also not surprising she won best actress. She got a 2 minute standing ovation.&&July 13th seems to be a good date for movie lovers.  ""Eighth Grade"" and ""Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot"" are opening that weekend.&&For a second I thought that meant that Bo Burnham did a documentary about Mr. Rogers&&I honestly started crying about two minutes into Won't You Be My Neighbor? and then just didn't stop for the entire movie. There were just constantly tears running down my face.&&I remember watching Bo from day one almost. His talent only continued to grow and I bet it still will. So excited to see this because he really has a fantastic mind, especially with his age. Trailer looked good, hope it does well and always curious about future work Bo does. &&His can't handle this song and video I think are absolutely incredible 

https://youtu.be/rYy0o-J0x20&&Maybe this is a really stupid question, but is there a way to watch either of these films, as someone who lives in Canada? Are they going to be made available at some point?&&Why did I not know that Eighth Grade was made by Bo Burnham until I read this?&&Bo is fucking talented&&I remember watching his ""Rehab for Imaginary characters"" video and laughing my ass off. His standup isn't just funny but also #deep. ""Make Happy"" is probably his best one and it's pretty depressing at times. &&Couple months ago, can't remember what movie we were seeing, but ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" was one of the trailers. My wife leaned over and said ""We need this movie right now"". At a time when our country is divided, I couldn't agree with her more&&My sister has won that award for her short &&When and where the heck can I see Eighth Grade?!?!?!&&Holy shit i didnt know bo was making a film&&Hyped as fuck for both of these movies &&Our film, thunder road, won the New American Cinema award there!&&fred rodgers was the real deal, a caring man who cared for children and was not like all the hollywood creeps who are borderline pedos trying to be the biggest perve. he was kind and intelligent and did not suffer fools, a great addition to my childhood unlike the a.d.d creator sesame street. rip mr rodgers&&I saw Bo today. He seemed lost in a stoic melancholy. &&Saw *Won’t You Be My Neighbor* last night, it was a delightful and honest look at the creator behind the show.&&TIL my city has an ""International film festival""&&Bo knows Diddley. 

The boy is brilliant. &&It's a shame both are an hour away in theaters and VERY limited nights they are showing.&&Yay Bo! He's so talented, and long overlooked.  I feel like a proud mama, even though I'm not related at all. &&Can’t wait to see the Mr.Rogers documentary! &&Burnham is a prodigy. He's still so young and has had incredible success because of basically unbelievable talent. I look forward to continuing to watch his career as he enters the Donald Glover-level stratosphere of ""there's nothing this guy can't do.""&&Got a chance to see an early screening of Eighth Grade and it was great! He really captured the awkwardness of being that age.&&Bo!! Man I’m so happy for him. He’s seriously one of the most creative and intelligent people of our time, and he’s still so young. It’s so crazy to watch him go from the 15 year old YouTube star making hilarious pun-filled comedy songs and skits, to extremely deep yet hysterical one man show, and now a director/producer winning awards and working with legends like Chris Rock!

I can’t wait to watch this movie. I’ve loved all his songs and skits and shows so dearly, I love “Egghead” and his acting ability, and this will be no different. Go Bo!&&r/titlegore&& He's just a wonderfully gifted entertainer,   ... and I'm unhappy &&i’d really like to see bo’s project, he’s the most relatable comedian out there &&Eighth Grade is a comedy? What in the...&&Remind me in 30 days&&I’m so happy to hear that. I love Bo’s work &&Upvote for SIFF on the frontpage!&&Bo is so fucking young for what he has already accomplished and added to art.    
Imagine how much he will have given us by the time he's in his prime&&Where can I watch Eighth Grade?&&Bo Burnham is the white Donald Glover.&&WOW. Good for him, I’ve always thought he is so innovative. Very happy for him &&Saw an early screening of Eighth Grade \+ Q&A with Bo Burnham. It's an incredible movie, and I'm convinced Bo is a genius sent from heaven to gift us with smart, funny films.&&Thanks so much to everyone who made this possible! Love you guys! &&Saw Eighth Grade at Sundance London. Terrific film. Very realistic and beautifully done. &&Why does the word eighth look like it's spelled wrong?&&Where can u watch both of these movies online? Asking for a friend who is In To documentaries and public television inspiring thousands of youth who happen to be born in 1984, and from Texas.  Not to be oddly specific, but again this person is not me.&&I am openly hostile towards most contemporary musicians/comedians/etc because I find them wanting. 

But documentaries are better than they've ever been and Burnham is immensely talented.   &&Man, I was hoping Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda was gonna win the documentary category, but I forgot that Won't You Be My Neighbor was in the running...&&A24 is putting out some amazing films. I loved Good Time last year&&I got to be at the Hot Docs festival in Toronto this year, and everyone was talking about that Mr. Rogers documentary. Although I didn't have time to see it, my colleague saw it and said it brings back memories that have been buried way deep down for years, and that he was in tears. 

The director, Morgan Neville, was giving a talk which I dropped in on and he showed a quick clip that just looked so god damn good. This is one I can't wait to see. &&It took me way too long to realize that the Mr Rogers Documentary was not made by Burnham.&&I wish that I could upvote this more than once.&&The first vine I ever saw was Bo Burnham asking Jesus to pass the water but Jesus passed wine&&Just watched the trailer for “won’t you be my neighbor” and cried. Legitimately cried within the first 15 fucking seconds. I don’t have the faintest idea of when the last time I cried was. I also had no idea that Mr. Rodgers meant that much to me, though I suspect it’s not the man himself, or the literal show, but abstract concepts. Towards the end it made me think of all the children(and adults) being killed and starving to death in Yemen, from our weapons no less. Fuck. &&Rumor is WYBMN has been picked up by Netflix, although I haven't seen anything yet to support it.&&I can’t wait to forget to see both of these movies. &&I grew up on Mr. Rogers and have a 11yo daughter who loves seeing movies with me. Would this be a good father daughter movie?&&I am always glad to see bo doing new things...  definitely going to watch the mr Rogers doc as well&&I wanna see eighth grade so bad!&&Should we mention that the short has a 100&#37; on rotten tomatoes?   
[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eighth\_grade/](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eighth_grade/)&&Its great to see people like no do well,  because he was just a kid that started in bedroom writing funny songs, just shows you what can be done with some dedication and hard work.&&Wow. I've known about that this guy for awhile. I'm not surprised to see this kind of success, just really jealous.&&I’m so glad Bo Burnham is doing something. I wish he still did music, but this is close enough for me.&&He’s Bo, yo&&I’m surprised to not see Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You mentioned at all- I didn’t see it but quite a wave of people enjoying it came into my feed when it screened. Can’t wait to see it myself.&&I feel like Bo Burnham is so talented it's almost unfair.  It feels as if, by his early/mid-20s, he was somehow able to hone his comedy skills to a level of seamlessness and perfection that some of the most talented comedians in history have taken decades to achieve.  I'm thoroughly excited for a movie directed by him.&&I just realized that we call Calgary International Film Festival “CIFF” (said kiff). And Toronto has “TIFF”, so would that make Seattle be “SIFF”.  Sounds like the STD. 🤣&&I enjoyed Won't You Be My Neighbor? but I am just a little puzzled by the overwhelming response. Though Fred Rogers was a great guy and there's a bit of interesting information in the film, the film is a pretty superficial portrait that provides little most people who are familiar with him didn't know. I do recommend it. There's just not that much in it that you learn about Fred Rogers.&&If this movie doesn’t win best documentary feature at the oscars this year, I am personally gonna Hunt down every copy of crash, the artist and the kings speech and burn them all in a bonfire&&In my opinion bo is overrated and originally corny &&Did anyone see that flashback episode of Atlanta where they showed the main characters back in middle school? That episode damn near gave me a panic attack! And middle school was half a life-time ago for me! Based on the trailer for Eighth Grade I saw the other day, I'm not sure I can handle it.&&This is as good a place as any to ask, you movie-going, film-festival folks...

I really want to watch ""Three Christs"" a movie that Peter Denklage starred in last year. I believe it was at the Toronto film festival. How/when can I ever expect to see this movie? I've been keeping my eyes or for it for the last like 8 months and I cannot find anything!&&I'm sure Eighth Grade is amazing but I have no desire to subject muself to middle school horrors again&&How the fuck did *Bo Burnham* write such an authentic take on the life of a *girl* in *middle school*? 

On second thought, I don't want to know.&&Is this an advertisement?&&The bo burnham joint was thunderously boring&&question, isn't 'won't' an abbreviation for 'will not', or 'would not?' 

so....is what Mr. Rodgers saying ""would you not be my neighbor?"" Has he passively been asking people to get off his lawn for decades?&&I voted for Hillary's America..&&[deleted]&&Why do movies that have insecure little girls as the story always receive such high praise?&&Thunder Road is STILL on the festival circuit?&&Are there any legal places to watch these movies online?

&&Dude the way you wrote the title made me think he directed both movies, and I was incredibly impressed with his career for a few minutes (I mean I already am, even more so though) &&A24 strikes again. &&Thanks OP&&I saw ""The Guilty."" Geez, that was a terrific and tense movie, particularly considering that on screen, what you mainly guy was an Emergency Services operator on the phone in one of two rooms.  I think the editor might also deserve an award.  Damn good. &&Pic of Best Film writer and director Bo Burnham, Best Actress Elsie Fisher, and SIFF artistic director Beth Barrett after the screening of Eighth Grade at Seattle's Egyptian Theater.

[Eighth Grade Q&A at SIFF 2018](https://i.imgur.com/AVcFLrU.jpg)&&SIFF has announced the [showtimes for their Best of SIFF](https://www.siff.net/year-round-cinema/film-series/best-of-siff-2018), so Seattlites can see the winning films in case they missed them in the festival.

""Neighborhood"" isn't on that list because it's getting a scheduled release at SIFF Uptown(?) on June 15th. &&Saw it yesterday in Dallas, worth the drive 100%. It was like the whole audience was connected just by seeing the film together. A lot funnier than I expected, too.

I almost cried a couple times, and I know most people were tearing up in the end too, but all I could do was laugh, not ironically or sardonically but just in the joy the movie brought.&&[deleted]&&Would love to see it with a Pittsburgh crowd considering that’s where the show was filmed. &&I was at the international premiere in Toronto. Really warmed this Pittsburgh gal’s heart!&&Would you recommend it to someone who has no idea who Mr Rogers is? &&More so than Dear Zachary?&&I'm too young to have grown up with Mr. Rogers, but I want to go watch this movie and cry my eyes out&&But if you saw it in Youngstown, would it have been worse or better?&&I'm just learning about this, but I'm not sure I could survive seeing this in the theater after watching the trailer.  Good grief I'm a blubbering trainwreck right now.&&Didn't like the guy. But it was good I guess.&&The trailer alone had me all misty\-eyed. &&I feel like in years it will unfortunately be forgotten if the Tom Hanks movie is any good but we'll see&&Agreed.  Where do you see it?  I saw at a festival and there were a few people bawling.&&Is it worth watching even for someone who has never seen Mr Rogers? &&Literally on the toilet at a Pittsburgh movie theater right now after finally seeing it this weekend. My god, I thought I was being too loud by taking sharp breathes because I was crying. But after I settled down, I heard so many others sobbing. It was an incredible moment. &&The trailer makes me tear up every time, I'm going to be a mess when I finally see it.&&Went to see it yesterday and the theatre was so quiet on the way out. So many people trying not to just break down and cry. It was such a good documentary but man did it hit hard. 

To those who haven’t seen it; I highly, highly recommend going to see it if a theatre near you has it! 143&&I cried so much but it felt so good to cry tears of joy.&&Was there a reception afterwards at Il Gattopardo?&&I can almost picture the awkward smile from Bo when you said that.&&>Big Boys

Oh boy, I haven't heard of that one in a *WHILE*. &&I met Bo in 2010 after a show he did with Tim Minchin. I was nervous and awkwardly told him that I'm a huge fan, and he responded equally awkwardly. It was great. Tim was super awkward too and it was the best.&&I almost met him. I saw him at the Bamboozle Music Festival. Got to his tent but it was packed so I had to stand on the edge of the outside where there was dripping water and no one else wanted to stand. Then I got to his meet and greet later but got the time wrong so he was leaving when I got there. He was walking away, maybe about 20 feet away from me, and I wanted to call out to him but didn't for some reason. One of my biggest regrets, easily one of my most favorite artists. &&I can hear your voice crack a little after you tried to awkwardly pitch it up at the end to form a question and realizing it didn't call for that&&I just want him and the stuff he makes to do well. I've only enjoyed him and his content through YouTube, and the Can't Handle This skit almost broke me. It seemed so wrong to enjoy comedy from a guy who all but screamed ""HELP ME"" in his lyrics..&&He's a personal hero for a lot of kids who grew up watching his videos and his stand\-up. It's amazing, isn't it?&&""I had a privileged life, and I got lucky... and I'm unhappy""&&Burnham is a guy I have a lot of respect for because he is very objective about his fame and puts a lot of effort into creating projects that are very personal to him and unique. 

Glad to see he is having success, and am very much looking forward to seeing Eighth Grade.

His screenplay for Gay Kid and Fat Chick was very entertaining &&Exactly how I feel whenever I see Donald Glover reaching new heights. &&It's like seeing someone from your small hometown/region go on to be famous. The connection is slight, but it feels personal. Every album he put out, every special he aired, brought his brilliance to more and more people, and suddenly the one other person who knew who Bo was was around me turned into virtually everybody. This dorky kid my age making YouTube songs I listened to over and over at my first summer job is now winning directing awards. That's enough of a connection for me to feel pride.&&Zach Stone Got Famous&&Me too!  Bo has always had a special place in my heart since I first saw his videos over 10 years ago. I always thought he deserved more recognition because he is truly a gift and artistic genius. &&I am a dutch guy and the funniest (dutch) comedian I know is Hans Teeuwen. Seeing an English comedian follow in Hans Teeuwen his footsteps is amazing because this style of ""cabaret"" is way more enjoyable then just stand up comedy. Dutch cabaret is mixing stand up with a lot of songs and sketches and dutch absurdist cabaret is the very best .. well if you like absurdist humor. Hans Teeuwen was ""de koning van de lach"". [Here is a tiny bit of material of him.](https://youtu.be/NgUU6ZmtICQ?t=28)  

[And here he is twerking to jazz music in 2004.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5McsMJX_Ldc&feature=youtu.be)&&Bo and Donald Glover from back in the Derrick Comedy days both feel this way for me. Like somehow I deserve a right to be proud of them even though I never did anything.&&Albino Black Sheep&&I remember when he got his show on MTV I was so excited for his big break. It didn't do so well, glad to see his name on a bunch of stuff recently, pretty sure he directed Dave Chappelles last stand up as well&&Hes antimarket. Which is a good market. &&/u/comedybronzemine&&Since my brother and I watched “I’m Bo Yo” we’ve been fans ever since. I know where you are coming from. Truly wonderful to see him have success. &&I feel the same way. From hearing I'm Bo Yo when it first released to this, it's just very impressive. &&I feel this way about Donald Glover. &&Hell yeah! We went to the same high school. All dudes, Catholic prep school. Good times.&&All the seats in the Sunday masses...&&Him, Donald Glover, and the creator of Bojack Horseman (Raphael Bob-Waksberg) are all people who give me this feeling.  I know I have no real personal connection to them and have no reason to feel *proud* of their success, but it's just so awesomely surreal to me.  I used to watch silly low-budget internet videos from these people when I was in high school and laugh my ass off, and there's something deeply satisfying about seeing them finally inspiring a ton of other people's senses of humor in the way they've influenced mine.&&You could have just said ""I liked him before he was cool"" &&I'm mixed on him.  Saw him live and he (the venue) had lasers that were eye level with the audience. 7/10&&I’ve been a fan since “3.14 Apple Pie” - he’s definitely a hero of mine!&&[deleted]&&The greatest rapper ever&&No spoilers, but is it immensely depressing or uplifting? Want to know what I’m getting into. Love Bo&&Okay WHEN can I see this&&You say representative of middle school in the modern era. I went to middle school over a dozen years ago so I figured it would r a little lost on me just because of how much I’d assume things had changed in those years. Was it still relevant?&&Thank you for sharing your thoughts &&That's a bold claim. If this ends up being another modern update on The 400 Blows I'm going to be disappointed.&&You basically just summed up every “coming of age” film ever so...lol &&better than this coming of age ""film""? 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5612742/&&I've seen the trailer twice and still don't understand what the movie is about nor could I find the comedy.&&[Eighth Grade Q&A with Bo Burnham, Elsie Fisher, and SIFF Artistic Director Beth Barrett](https://i.imgur.com/hLn1GS2.jpg)&&Bo burnham is fucking my dad....&&NO PRESSURE, BO&&I mean, he kind of already is. Have you seen Make Happy?&&Elsie was out of this world. People who haven't seen the movie are in this thread applauding Bo but they have no idea how big of Elsie Fisher fans they are going to be after seeing the movie.&&Let’s hope he turns into the next Steven Spielberg!!!!&&I remember the videos from Big Boys which later became Break. YouTube was really in its infancy then. Bo properly is one of the original consistent viral stars. &&It just opened this week and is in 29 theaters. I expect it to expand pretty well, at least 400 theaters since that's what RBG did and Focus Features (WYBMN?) is a bigger distributor than Magnolia (RBG)&&That ampersand carried a ton of weight &&I just got back from seeing it.  I only cried a handful of times. :)&&The part where he says ""Come and watch the skinny kid with the steadily declining mental health, and laugh as he attempts to give you what he cannot give himself."" Hits me really hard each time I hear it. &&Usually films tour the festival circuit and if they perform well, receive a cinematic release. &&Not sure about Canada but Eighth Grade is set to be released in the US on July 13th.&&July 13th at a theater somewhat near you&&Is your film about Mad Max?&&Wow, you guys must really love Garth Brooks to make an extended music video for him.&&Should we tell him about PAX too?&&Uhhh its largest film festival in the states...and has been going for over 40 years. Transplant I assume?&&Seriously? Do you not leave your home in May/June? It's a 3wk festival that takes over most of the downtown theaters and even screens out in Kirkland and Bellevue, and the city is covered in posters for it from beginning of May onward. Last year the downtown Nordstrom window displays were all creepy SIFF mannequin ads. Ethan Hawke and Joaquin Phoenix were on Capitol Hill last night for their SIFF presentations and the closing ceremony.

This also means you missed the hilarious drama a few years ago when the secret fest track (adventurous people can buy tickets to sign an NDA and see 6 mystery screenings) showed a bunch of unsuspecting people A Serbian Film. Definitely worth looking up the forum threads around that.

I'm actually kind of excited for you, if you're into movies this is like...a whole new local amenity that you've been missing out on. SIFF supports 3 venues year round that show a lot of interesting, quirky, often great movies I wouldn't have had on my radar otherwise - and they put real butter on their popcorn. The festival is just the event they use to fund the rest of the year's programming. &&Man I relate to that feeling so much and don’t know why haha&&Why did it almost give you a panic attack?&&That answers that question...&&Won't = will not
Wouldn't = would not

Though through the evolution of the language ""Won't you ___"" has usually implied an invitation. &&English is fucky.&&""Won't"" is ""will not"" and ""wouldn't"" is ""would not.""&&What's that have to do with the topic?&&r/NobodyAsked&&HAHAHAHAH&&Bo is a great guy irl, I’ve never seen anyone say anything bad about their experiences with Bo.&&They don’t.

Wtf you people think youre stealing candy from a poverty stricken child? Gtfo. If you dont want risk get a seed box.&&Bless &&Do you think people who literally have no connection to him would still enjoy it? From the trailers it looks fantastic even though I’ve never even seen him in action, just curious. &&Almost cried? You are a machine my friend.....  :)&&Yes! Several moments were hilarious... not a dry eye in the theater towards the end.&&When I had kids, they watched Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. Hearing the songs on that show made me remember things from Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and I would literally break down. Any song about being good enough the way you are, even the ""It's such a good feeling"" song made me cry! 

I forgot that someone tried to teach me self worth as a kid, and that person was Fred Rogers.&&I saw it last Friday and they had a ton of dust and pollen in the theater.

Lots of people were having allergic reactions, including me.

Great movie though.&&Same actually. He is really quite possibly the best person ever.&&r/churchofrogers &&It was really something, I’m so proud that he is from here.

If there's something more emotional and gut wrenching than Dear Zachary,  I don't think I can bear to watch it.&&Go for it, there’s a lot to learn&&I don’t think it would change that much, it’s just a little extra special seeing it in Pittsburgh&&Yes, it will destroy you&&How don’t you like Mr. Rogers?&&I watched the trailer before Tully a few weeks ago and legit started crying for a good 3 minutes&&I saw a shirt clip on Good Morning America Sunday Addition. I was totally in tears!!! Such an amazing man. His message works too!!&&Tom Hanks movie?&&Alamo Drafthouse last Wednesday, part of their ""rewards"" program. The host started crying while introducing the picture and sharing a memory. I knew I'd be in trouble when the trailer made me cry before seeing Avengers, but damn. That scene with Coco the gorilla broke me. &&Like playing basketball? Seems out of place imo. &&Yes it is. It displays the life of one of kindest gentlest human being in the last hundred years. Mr. Rogers is what every person should aspire to be in their life.&&I don't have anywhere near the sentimentality for Mr. Rogers that many redditors seem to have, but it was a very enjoyable documentary. &&Absolutely. The movie is really a celebration of Fred Rodgers's life, and is incredibly kind and positive throughout. &&In the far future, God is sitting and the gates with Peter as a a man cries his defense, ""You never sent Jesus back for the rapture!""

God stares at the man and says, ""I sent you someone better, I sent Fred Rodgers!""&&If you want to see it for context, it is on Amazon Prime.&&You went to the bathroom to cry? &&What theater? I was at the South Side one today seeing Hereditary and it said June 15th.&&He loves stuff like that. I met him in Florida. I drove only a hour or so from my state. Would have met him but it was late and I didn't want to stand in line&&That site was so good back in the day&&Whaaaat that’s so cool. Tim’s one of my favorites. What’s he like?&&Oh, so this isn't the Bo that wondered off a military base?&&Awe. He's human like you or I. Don't feel too bad. There are going to be so many great people you'll meet in your life, so don't hang onto that regret.&&He's just a wonderfully gifted entertainer and he's as dark as he is glib. Bo is special and I hope all the brains he has don't drive him crazy&&He is also a fantastic role model who kept his personality genuine but never bullshitted his young fans about the amount of hard work and luck that was necessary in his success.

&&It's funny I grew up loving Bo Burnham, saw him live his first tour, sat on his lap, creeped him the fuck out. All around great guy.

One of my buddies from college went to school with Bo, says he is a massive smug asshole who always acted superior to everyone around him in a /r/iamverysmart sort of way.

Just made sure to never bring up Bo Burnham around him again.&&That bit of the show makes me feel so many things. I have so much respect for his perspective on life.&&Same! I remember watching derrickcomedy videos when they were first coming out on Youtube and I was a little too young to really get all the jokes. The first time I saw a Childish Gambino music video I thought he was just acting in it lol&&My theory is that his character in the This is America video is just a continuation of the mad hatter. &&Bo Burnham is the white Donald Glover!&&For me he actually is local too! We’re not from the same town but definitely feeling the MA pride on this one. Hometown hero for sure. 

Somebody I met at a party recently said they knew someone who went to high school with Bo and that he was a dick. I just refused to believe them lmao&&That show was so funny &&I feel like no introduction to Hans Teeuwen is complete without [Little Ronnie](https://youtu.be/8RsxbRQmhco) &&That’s actually who Bo said is his biggest inspiration. &&[deleted]&&And I’ll weather your weather&&He’ll weather your weather whether you think he’s clever or not. &&You take the b-a-t out of basement &&Overall more uplifting than depressing, ends on a good note 👌&&There's only one scene where it gets a bit creepy, but otherwise it's ultimately humorous and uplifting.&&I watched it yesterday at SIFF Egyptian and Bo was there. The movie made me feel generally very happy. &&Definitely uplifting. Filled me with such warm\-fuzzy feelings at the end, just a very feel\-good movie.&&July 1_ , 20__&&Me too thanks&&Same like you. I'm 32 years old, but I can still definitely relate to the struggle of being ""invisible"" and ""not quite popular"" at school, and trying to get in to the ""in"" crowd or just your finding your place in school vs. being confident in yourself, which is the main theme of the movie.&&The trouble I have with these movies is they always feel like they are written about an ""outsider"" but by people who never were. They were popular kids, or ""near popular"" kids, trying to write from the perspective of the kids who weren't and didn't care to be that. 

I guess I'll see how this one turns out.&&Some things just never change haha. While it certainly goes down a well\-worn path, it does so in a way that it's so matter\-of\-fact and un\-glamorized, without being too mean\-spirited. &&yield&&My dad is fucking Bo Burnham&&I personally preferred what. &&[deleted]&&I caught it here in Pittsburgh I guess I’m lucky that I share a hometown with him.&&Exactly same. I thought end of his show, where he walks away from the piano he was done for good &&What happens to the films that don’t make it on theaters where are they released? &&Like released to theaters? Like I won't need to go to a festival? So excited.&&It's about the Bruce Springsteen song, kind of.&&That's Thunder Rolls, but don't get me started about how much I love that man and that song.&&Much more of a gamer than a movie buff, but I guess I must have heard of this at some point in my life.  I'm 25, there's no way I haven't heard of this, I'm just amazed because I also flew this weekend and didn't notice an exceptionally large incoming crowd.  &&Nope lived in/around for my entire life. I refuse to believe it's the biggest in the nation though considering it's the first I've heard of it and Sxsw seems to be enormous. Where do they do the viewings? I also haven't ever heard it advertised on a radio station once in my entire life. &&Decided to give it a Google, and googling ""biggest film festival in the us"" yields a large list of festivals, none of the first 20 including the Seattle one, and a list of top 10 festivals that came in the same Google search didn't have it included at all. &&Did you see the episode? It was mainly the visuals, and the beats and rhythms of middle school and possibility of merciless ridicule that the episode set up.

&&""Will not you come in?""&&It was a joke. Why are redditors so lame these days?&&I should make a movie about and 8th grade boy who is coming to grips with sitting on the bench of his baseball team who also happens to just discover masturbating. maybe i'll win some award&&Ohhhhh &&https://media.giphy.com/media/1uC8xfkZRi7Kw/giphy.gif&&I’m super intrigued by that. The short had such an understated story, and a feature could go nearly anywhere.&&Thanks! Any idea where?&&[deleted]&&RemindMe! July 13&&Is this a new standup special or an actual movie/short?&&I never watched it as a kid, at least from what I can remember. I've seen a lot of clips of him on youtube, so I was already familiar with him. I think I still would have enjoyed it walking in blind, but admittedly some of my experience was enriched from having already heard some of the stories about him and seeing them fleshed out.
I would still recommend it of you have no connection with the guy or the show. Most of it was still new to me anyway. It's just a shame it's only showing in select theaters.&&Saw it today with my boyfriend who didn’t watch him as a kid.  Both of us were on our last tissues by the end (even though I grabbed two handfuls of tissues before it began).

It’s something special. &&I saw an advance screening with a Q&A with the director. He commented that Mr. Rogers is not terribly well-known outside of North America, yet he showed it to a British audience who had no idea who he was and the response was overwhelmingly positive.

It's a wonderful film, too. Made me a little verklempt at least a few times.&&[deleted]&&I never watched the show when I was younger - I was a bit too old for it and thought it was corny.   I wept for the last 10 minutes of the film. It’s beautifully done and like all great films, helps you to see new parts of yourself. &&Yes absolutely. I watched it as a kid in the 70’a but many audience members had not. Powerful messages even if you never watched the show.&&I'd never heard of Mr Rogers before I moved to the US, and still have never watched an episode, but it was still a wonderful experience watching that movie. 

Extremely interesting, entertaining and emotional.&&I just watched it a few hours ago and I never thought I’d cry so much in a Mr Rogers documentary! &&Like the picture of the guys butt!!!!!!!!&&Huh&&Aw I absolutely adored him growing up, and until now I never really thought about where he actually lived. When I think back to remember what they meant to me at the time, all of my practical memories of him and Levar are sprinkled in and weirdly deeply meshed with my own irl memories. 

I think it’s a combo of 1. Having zero context for media as a thing in a society (or the constructedness of a tv production at all) and 2. Just thinking he was really cool and nice (etc etc)... ?

But it seems like at the time my little child brain experienced him as more of some sort of immanent super-friend than a human guy. That’s pretty funny. 

Anyway Pittsburgh rules, it’s one of my favorite cities in North America and now I have a whole new reason to appreciate it. &&So be it.&&[You Are My Friend](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3224458/)&&That's awesome I work at the alamo in the village. Which theater did you see it at? &&See this is the kinda of grammar fascism I can appreciate--with sarcasm and absurdism.  &&Hey if they paid for a ticket, you can’t judge &&There was no basketball in the film.

But there was some breakdancing!!!!!!!&&No it is not. That is a different movie.&&Nah bud, I went to the bathroom to poop. I just happen to still be crying. &&Waterfront and the Manor have it right now! &&He was so close and there wasn't anyone else going up to him. He was just walking. If I just had the balls to say something I could've probably had a conversation with him. I remember this moment so vividly, it was like surreal as a dream. &&He is the most talented person I think I’ve ever seen as a whole. Insanely intelligent too, the spotlight hit him young and that’s normally not the best thing for a person but he’s been in complete control of all of his creative projects, and recedes from the spotlight in between his pieces. He’s very aware of who he is, what he’s doing, and how it can affect him. I think he’ll be just fine&&Step on a crack, break your mother's back. Turn around and smoke the crack? Break your mother's heart.&&When he talks about being unhappy it tears me up inside. I can’t stand the thought of such a brilliant person being weighed down by shitty society. &&[deleted]&&Maybe not sit on people’s laps if not invited. &&Not sure if true or just repeating the finale of 'What'.   We....THINK....WE...KNOW.....YOU..... art is repeating life just like the oracle said!
&&I mean half of his material, as funny as it is, is pretty condescending so it's not a surprise that he's a bit of a prick. Still going to watch everything he makes though lol.&&[deleted]&&He's funny and makes a point.  Na na na na na...Batman.&&I heard what you said!&&lol I'm basically the same way. Always loved his early rap so his career arc has been very gratifying for me 🐸☕️&&“Have fun at sports, nerd!” &&You could really tell that it was Bo's passion project, the whole show just felt like Bo's humor and was great, sad it never got a second season, :/&&It was better in original dutch but I am glad he translated some of his material so you english wankers know just how briljant and insane this guy was. He did all his shows on cocaine and then eventually quit because the shows made him to tired. [And yeah they did, he runs around more then I do when I play soccer.](https://youtu.be/5McsMJX_Ldc)
 Then yeeeeears later he ran out of money and so he started doing shows again but he stopped being original and was just rehashing his older work. When absurdist comedians do this they become predictable for the people that know the original material and then it's not that funny anymore. 

Then there is [Kees Torn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W53y-2zNS4) who does more with music and is at least twice as briljant as Hans Teeuwen (but not as absurd). En [Toon Hermans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGM46J71yvc) who can be seen a bit as the father of Hans Teeuwen his style.



But good luck if you don't speak dutch .... us dutchies ... we got spoiled with some of the best comedians in the world. At the moment [Ronald Goedemondt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svbMr5ffz6c) is probably by far the best dutch comedian still coming out with original material. &&[I just put this on the internet, enjoy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/8q8bt8/dutch_absurdist_comedian_hans_teeuwen_twerking_on/) &&The one thing the movie touched on was that he was concerned that having an openly gay cast member would have led sponsors to pull out (in the 70) and asked a cast member not to be seen at gay clubs. I've read some publications that focused on this.&&Don't need a sweater, I'm hot&&Well that’s kind of a spoiler. Expected, but still.&&That's a pretty big spoiler.&&Fuck, I'm both alive and dead on that day.&&That's a pretty large generalization. I think it has more to do with no one can really capture 100% that feeling of dread being in middle/highschool. Especially since it's adults writing the story about kids. Everyone knows that when youre a kid no adult gets you. That's why they vary in quality I think.&&Yield this silly game and shed your mask&&My dad Bo is Burning ham fuck&&what?&&Because that would be dope.&&Did you ever get to meet him while he was alive there?&&Straight to dvd / digital purchase&&At least in the US. I don’t know about Canada.&&Haha, can't believe I've been mixed up about that title for years. Anyhow, I'm looking forward to seeing your film!&&This was closing weekend, not opening - people who came in just for the fest would've arrived around May 19. &&Yeah...SIFF is massive. Screening are all over town, Uptown, Egyptian, SIFF Film Center, had some in Shoreline this year. The claim of “biggest” may be dated at this point, for years they indeed showed more films than any other fest. 

Fun fact - the opening film for 1989 festival was Empire Strikes Back. &&I mean, it's no Sundance or SXSW, but it's still not some podunk town film festival. &&Wow. SIFF is a huge deal. Im not sure how you could miss it. It gets lots of media attention the Seattle Times and the Stranger. &&Google it or go to SIFF.net. 

It is indeed the largest film festival in the United States and this was the 44th year, I believe. The Stranger does a special SIFF issue each year and the official guides are distributed all over the city. I can't believe you've never seen them.

This year's main venues were The Egyptian, three screens at The Uptown in lower Queen Ann, one screen at Pacific Place downtown, and the smaller SIFF Film Center. They also did some ""suburban"" screenings at Lincoln Square in Bellevue, Ark Lodge in Columbia City, Kirkland Performance Center, and Shoreline Community College. The Egyptian and The Uptown are actually owned and operated by SIFF.

&&If it's good then it just might. I mean, you're coming off like the movies that get attention aren't good and just get attention for the subject material. Is that what you are getting at?&&Do you hate all coming of age movies or just ones about girls rather than boys? I can't tell if you're joking or if you legitimately think there aren't a million acclaimed movies about boy children coming into their teens. It's an incredibly, incredibly popular movie genre.

Edit because never mind, I see you're trolling - but I'll take this space anyway to just say for others that The Perks of Being A Wallflower, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Dope (sort of, it's a bit more Ferris Bueller comedy than drama), and Me & Earl & The Dying Girl are all excellent recent coming of age movies about male protagonists. I saw Gold Seekers recently too and it was pretty good, more The Goonies style adventure than what I'd call coming of age though. &&We show your Thunder Road short all the time at my school. It's amazing. Any plans for a wider or digital release on the feature after the festival circuit?&&I’d guess it will be on iTunes and Google play. I don’t see a pre-order up on iTunes though.&&Not sure, its through A24 so I would expect at least Amazon&&The internet, probably. Maybe some stores? /s&&It has, it has been at select theaters for the past several months&&It is a film that he wrote and directed.&&Just google it dude... It's a movie that doesn't star him.&&I saw it at the international premiere in Toronto where it was sold out but most people had never watched the show before. Everyone loved it anyway. &&Hilrious yes.&&[deleted]&&We are so proud he is from here!

[wipes ass]&&Can confirm, left the Waterfront crying the other day.&&He was great on The Green Room with Paul Provenza.

Off the top of my head, it had Gary Shandling, Marc Maron, Bo, Ray Romano, and someone else.

It was pretty funny all around.&&He's the white Donald Glover&&I only came across him relatively recently, just within the past few years. He has a brief cameo in one of George Watsky's music vids, and I saw people freaking out about it in the comments, so I checked it out and was blown away. It was shortly after he released What. I think.&&This is very well said and one of the best complements I’ve ever seen given to someone. &&LOL at ""abandoned his friends."" Please. Plenty of people don't stay friends with their high school classmates, that's doesn't mean anything. Maybe they were shitty friends. Maybe he was depressed and couldn't keep up with being famous and maintaining his social circle. Frankly it's none of our business because like you said, he's a stranger.&&Almost no one stays friends with their high school friends.

Also, *you've changed bro.*&&Really? Do you have a source? Not calling bullshit (just yet) I just remember seeing in a couple interviews where he talks about coming off the road early/taking a break from his career after his first tour because he missed his friends.. was something like ""I was looking at social media and seeing all my friends in college out partying while I was stuck on a bus driving to the next gig"". That might even be from his AMAs&&I’m not justifying anything he did as I don’t know him, you, or anything about what you are referring to. But I do know that sometimes you have to let go of friends that aren’t conducive to your goals and dreams. I have a lot of friends I really love but I don’t really call them anymore because they have limiting mindsets or are un able to see me as who I am now vs. who I was when they met me. Bo seems to work really hard, maybe he had to just spend time alone/with other people to grow in the direction he wanted to. Maybe he is actually a bad friend to the people you are referring to and that’s not right. You trying to take away from what he gave to his fans though does not make much sense.&&Maybe his friends sucked&&>  someone who abandoned his friends in high school after he got youtube famous.

Then again we'd be talking about Bo right around the time he realyl started to get a following and when he was a teen so it's not like im trying to claim he's some sort of huge prick right now. &&I'd wager most of the downvotes are because you've made 3 posts about how many downvotes you're getting.

But, if it's any consolation, I'd say that still doesn't really spoil how exactly it ends, or what about it is particularly fulfilling about it. &&For context, a list of other movies that ""end on a good note,""

The Shining

I use the term pretty loosely, it's not necessarily the same as a ""happy ending"" - sorry if you take offense.

That show was absolutely brilliant in how well it connected with kids. You can tell watching it now as an adult that it was written by people that never forgot how they felt about certain things as a kid. Whether it be the feeling of your first crush, that feeling of panic/pride when you’re getting away with something you shouldn’t be doing, or the feeling of resentment over your parents’ seemingly arbitrary rules, they fuckin nailed it.

Hmm...&&Because he has the talent and aspiration to be one of the all time greats!&&It's held at theaters all around town. And they own two as well (the Egyptian and the Uptown). 

Admittedly the only local radio I regularly listen to is KEXP and KUOW and it gets lots of mention there but thats public radio so of course it will. &&SIFF, the organization, owns 3 theaters with a total of 5 screens: SIFF Film Center (in Seattle Center, just north of Key Arena -- roughly 60 seats), SIFF Uptown (2 blocks away, on Queen Anne Ave at Republican Street, across the street from Dick's; 3 screens, ~150, 250, 450), and SIFF Egyptian (Pine St, half a block west of Broadway on Capitol Hill --not sure on seats).  Both Egyptian and Uptown used to be owned by the Landmark Chain.  SIFF runs those theaters year-round, but during the Festival they are dedicated entirely to the cause.

During the festival, they also run movies all day in Screen 11 at Pacific Place downtown, and have various other screens though often not for the entire run of the festival: Majestic Bay in Ballard (just 1 week this year because Solo booted SIFF out of their main ground-floor screen; usually 2-3 weeks); Ark Lodge in Columbia City, Shoreline Community College, Kirkland Performance Center, and sometimes the Renton Ikea, which apparently has a small theater there; who knew?  &&You were too obvious playing the idiot when you claimed ignorance of one of the most popular genres of film while also saying you hate children - it's like saying ""I hate dessert, but I also wish someone would recommend me some good chocolate ice cream since only fruit flavors get any hype these days."" Try to be more subtle next time and you might get people actually riled. &&They asked the hall who had seen it on CBC growing up during the Q&A and maybe one or two people tops raised their hands.  All the people who had seen the show as kids were Americans, as there's a huge expat community here.  Most of my colleagues are Canadians in their 20s/30s and none of them ever saw the show growing up.

To give you an idea though I had an extra ticket and the woman in the standby line I gave it to was British, had never seen Mister Rogers, just heard of it and thought it'd be a cool documentary to see.&&Ooh, is this a new meta? It feels like it's been too long since I last saw one of those.&&Coconut?&&Yeah, he can pull a Jackie Robinson or Howard Stern.

It will also co-star Tessa Thompson playing Molly, a young woman who knows that aliens exists and is determined to become an MIB agent.*

Thor: Ragnarok In Black&&it's not a reboot. it's just an all new cast but in the same world.&&Every time they talk about a men in black reboot I get more pissed that they couldn't do a crossover with 21 Jump Street,&&Have Danny Devito play the pug! Notice I said “play,” not “voice.” Looking at you, makeup&&I just wish they would reboot something that failed instead of successful films. The new ones almost never live up to the original. Use reboots as a second chance for an idea that had potential.

EDIT: For the people with reading problems, I didn't ask why they don't do it. I know why. Everyone knows why. You're not hitting me with any zingers here.&&> The script, penned by Matt Holloway and Art Marcum, is set within the same universe as the previous films

So...a spin-off, not a reboot&&Almost positive it's actually a spin off&&I would like to see an alternate timeline where young Agent K just turns into Josh Brolin instead of Tommy Lee Jones.  He is pretty much same age as Tommy Lee Jones in the first one now.  He could still do the Tommy Lee Jones impersonation from MIB 3.&&Probably asking too much but I hope the reboot is smarter like the first MIB than MIB 2, it was still funny but didn't feel as ""real"" as the first. But it's probably going to be just slapstick and a lot of awkward pauses.&&No Jaden Smith?

https://i.imgur.com/UBP3Q27.jpg&&Why are they rebooting Men In Black?  Have they truly run out of ideas?&&How about a movie from non-agents point of view, where the agents are scary government bad guys that make people disappear and wipe their memories. Basically like the movies, without the comedy, from David Cross' point of view&&Do something that failed instead! Wild wild west anyone???&&So it's Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, Liam Neeson and now Kumail Nanjiani? Consider my hypEd&&Nice. Hopefully he contributes just a little more than his great acting.&&Not a reboot. It’s a sequel with different characters. 

So maybe a spin off. 

Either way, thankfully, it’s not a reboot. Reboots are terrible and usually pointless. Rebooting a movie that was made so recently is absurd. Having a spin off sequel, on the other hand, makes sense. &&I thought they were combining the next Jump Street with the next MIB&&Why, reboot, man. Have Will Smith do a cameo and continue the series, you assholes.&&Make a new goddamn movie instead.&&[deleted]&&We dont need a reboot.&&Look, sorry, but without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones I just don't care.&&Please no.&&It’s too fucking early for a reboot. &&r/hittablefaces&&Was anyone asking for a MIB reboot?&&here comes anothet flop!&&Thought they would've done it with all women.&&Zero interest in this.&&Who the fuck wants a Men In Black reboot??

Goddamn it.&&[deleted]&&Ugh, definitely not excited about this announcement. Why ruin MIB? Such a classic. &&I like him as a comedian, that's it.

I wish they wouldn't reboot a series that literally just had it's 3rd installment a few years ago.

I hope whatever part he plays is does better than his acting for ME: Andromeda. &&MIB doesn't need a reboot.  If they wanna milk the franchise, just make a new one, but have Will Smith partnered with someone else, and now Will Smith is the older guy.&&Why reboot it? You could just continue in the established universe, it has a bunch of potential. &&Hopefully we will get a CGI Michael Jackson cameo. Loved his character in the originals.&&Why the fuck are we rebooting Men In Black? 

How about an original story?&&Whoever asked for this? Men in black was amazing.  Leave it as is &&Why the fuck does this mediocre franchise need a reboot? &&Pfft. I bet they’ll replace the lead with a minority for diver-...wait&&Damit. Why make him british? Just make him a looney aussie instead. &&As long as it's an original story, and not rebooting J and K, I'm fine with this.

In fact, this is one universe of like to see, release different Men in Blacks, looking at different agents in each series. &&>	James Bond-esk

Quality writing right there.&&>esk&&If they bring in Jeff Goldblum to replace Rip Torn...death herself couldn’t stop me from seeing that movie!&&Esk?&&Chris Hemsworth was the best part about both the Vacation remake and the new Ghostbusters, guy has serious comedic talent.&&Wait Chris Hemsworth has a funny role in this? I’m sold, I love his comedic timing. &&-esk.  -ESK?!?!?

-esque, you dumb fuckers.&&Really should have gone for it and added Taika. His energy is infectious.  &&I was pissed about the idea of a Men in Black reboot until I saw this post and Kumail being on board. This could really work. The MIB universe is interesting enough that they can make more films without messing with the originals. I hope this is a reboot in terms of, all of the stuff in the 3 films happened and this is just a story of other characters within the MIB. &&They misused ""esque.""&&Jesus Christ. Esk? Are you fucking kidding me? &&...Yeah. 

As much as I love Ragnarok, I feel like this is a mistake. I think that seeing the two actors together like this will diminish the fun of the next Thor movie...

Unless...

Unless that means there won't *be* another Thor movie after Avengers...

Damn. &&I don’t understand why it needs a reboot &&I was just about to bitch about another reboot, but hearing that it won't be J and K is a bit reassuring. &&A little disappointed they didn't get Michael B Jordan or Chadwick Boseman to play the co star. Or put Idris Elba as the elder agent and Hemsworth as the newbie.&&Esk instead of esque makes me uncomfortable&&Might still be considered a franchise reboot though rather than an individual film reboot. &&I believe they call that a soft reboot&&Tbfh, after 21 and 22, I'd be down for a lot of the joke sequel cards they showed at the end. A MiB one would be hilarious, I reckon.&&Did anyone ever find out why not?&&Why is everyone so into that idea? I liked both, but I don't see how the two universes can connect and work together. &&Apparently North Korea ruined that chance. &&Is that not happening anymore?!  Bummer...&&I actually didn’t know this had fallen through until this moment. 

Now I’m pretty bummed. &&Id be just as happy with a Jonah and Channing cameo&&My time to shine. You know what movie deserves a fucking shot? The forgotten one. The one that got sent out to die. The one that still still breaks hearts. Motherfucking. Treasure planet. Get Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play Jim, maybe Jeff Goldblum to play the doctor, Anne Hathaway plays Mrs. Hawkins, and John Goodman can play Cyborg. This movie had terrible marketing, as a summer movie, especially released against Lilo and stitch. The art is beautiful, it’s a gorgeous reimagination of Treasure Island. There’s a great video talking about all this too, [here](https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA), Jesus fuck I’d do anything to make a live action remake happen.&&I don't disagree with you in principle, but from a business standpoint it unfortunately just doesn't make sense. People love the MiB brand, they hear that title and are immediately interested because they loved the original.

Meanwhile, if you reboot something that was crappy like RIPD (mentioned in another comment), people's only memories will be about how crappy that movie was and they'll just wonder ""why the heck are they rebooting *that*?""

If an RIPD reboot trailer was released today, would you even want to watch it? Meanwhile, if an MiB reboot trailer was released today, you'd probably at the very least check it out.&&Such as?

Also, if I were funding a reboot, I would fund something I knew had a reasonable floor, not something that could lose money a second time.&&Remaking things that didn't work gave us The Thing, The Fly, and The Blob. I wish more projects would use the same idea. &&Never going to happen. To the studios, the appeal of a reboot is that you have a built in fan base that will almost certainly come see your movie. If they rebooted a movie that people didn't like, people would probably be *less* likely to see it than an original movie. &&To be fair though this isn't like a ""start from scratch"" reboot. From what is known, this is still in the same world as the original movies, they're just focusing on a new set of characters and will likely have a different tone. This isn't like the recent Ghostbusters where they ignored and started over. This is more of a spin-off. The term reboot in this context meaning the series is just getting a defibrillator to the chest since the old series is sorta done but they wish to continue the brand. &&Looking at you, awful Eragon movie. Give me the inheritance cycle in movies damn it&&I'd love a really well developed Starship Troopers movie again because the sequels were terrible. It barely surpassed its budget at the box office. It cost around $120M to make in the mid 90s but still holds its own today.&&Now that Disney is going to own Fox's entertainment wing I'm holding out hope they do something with Firefly. Sequels, reboot, TNG-style sequel series, something. It's a great universe.&&Dredd was the perfect example and flopped hard despite being like a cyberpunk John Wick.

I'd love to see a big budget remake of something like League of Extraordinary Gentleman, something that did okay but missed the mark. &&Cinematic universe!&&I mean, they say that in the article.&&> He is pretty much same age as Tommy Lee Jones in the first one now

I never would've guessed, but damn close.&&Goddamn, did they ever nail that casting.  Brolin might as well be TLJ's son. &&MIB2 was awful. MIB3 had a goofy nostalgic charm to it though.&&He's busy giving cameos in Impractical Jokers.&&Is that Sal Vulcano's tattoo?
Edit: spelling&&Is this really a reboot? They are focussing on the London Branch. Has Sony explicitly said this is a reboot? &&It's a soft reboot/spin off, don't know why this article is talking otherwise.

From what original reports were saying, it takes place in the same universe, it's just a different group of agents&&They've rebooted Spiderman at least 3 times in my lifetime. The ran out of ideas a LONG time ago.&&This is the same studio which thinks that making a Spidey-less Spider-Man villain spin-off universe is a good idea. They stopped giving a shit years ago. Why start now?&&Man that was a disappointing movie.  Fantastic established story, A-list comedy/dramatic actors and yet somehow a D-level script/story/effects/movie.  &&>failed

.

>Wild Wild West

Pick one.&&> Liam Neeson

Ugh. Next the movie will be using 30 cuts to show a single jump or punch.  

example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCKhktcbfQM&&I hope he plays an alien that has ""infiltrated"" the MiB and is posing as an Earthling but the only thing is that everybody knows and doesn't care because he's ironically really good at his job because he sarcastically gives the right answers or whatever all the time by accident.&&He's got great comedy skills and charm, hopefully those shine through in the same sort of way that Will Smith's charm shone through in his MIB role. 

Edit: shit, I was thinking of Hemsworth. But it applies to Kumail too. &&isn't it just like a sequel or spinoff? without the old characters, but still set in the same world?&&Well if you're tired of them just vote with you wallet and don't see it. &&Ma'am in Black&&Feminine Black

With the hit song ""Feminine Black"" by Cardi B.&&All in burkas. Women in all black.&&Because the script was written before Hemsworth was cast.&&The existence of Australia is too much for American audiences, there are three types of nationalities that American audiences can acknowledge: 

- American  
- British    
- Foreign  
- * Crocodile Hunter/Dundee but honestly most American folks just think they are 'Tanned Silly British'.&&They probably assumed he was British.&&I would never in my life mind an Australian/New Zealand MiB film thanks to Taika Waititi.&&Yup, I agree.  I was worried it was gonna be a literal reboot, recasting J and K.  Which is just a stupid idea.  But yeah, if it's just more stories in that universe, I'm totally in.  That world is so fun, I want to see so much more of it.  It's not even really a ""reboot"", just another movie with different characters.  Could be super awesome.  &&I think it's Mens in Black. &&I wish the cartoon had a DVD release.  It was truly ""The Real Ghostbusters"" of that era.&&I just want my agents to be THE BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST SIR!

Edit: ""They got Chris Evans?""...  [whoosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXRi28W-ENY) the bit starts of 00:46&&And as long as they come up with new gags.  I don't want rehashed versions of jokes or points made by the first MiB which is a God damn classic to me and my family.  The second one was awful.  Third one was surprisingly good to me.  No where near the level of the first but hey, not every trilogy can have an Empire Strikes Back.  &&It's sort of quality-esk.&&>James Bond-eskeit&&(feat: Cate Blanchett)&&Then in the after credit scene it's all been a mental projection from the Grandmaster!&&""Now Sparky, we're not, uh, hosting an intergalactic, uh...uh, *kegger*, here, raahaa^haaa""&&Seriously.&&Thank God I'm not the only one that noticed. I thought I was taking crazy pulls for a second.
&&I think he means esque.&&He got to be a bit comedic in The Cabin in the Woods as well. It sat on a shelf for three years after filming, so he shot it after Star Trek but before Star Trek was released, and well ahead of Thor.&&That's like saying he was the cherry on top of two turd sundaes, but I do agree with you that he's a funny dude.

Thor Ragnarok is my favorite MCU movie (I generally don't like them but watch them because they're decent background noise) because it strips out all the shitty drama that gets undercut with badly-written comedy and instead goes full-on comedy thanks to Taika Waititi. He clearly knew Chris Hemsworth could do comedy and decided to just flat-out do it.&&There was an interview with the Ghostbusters cast where Melissa McCarthy described him as ""Funny like a guy that had to fight his way off the playground his whole life and he had to be funny so he didn't get his ass kicked.""&&Vacation remake?&&Don't forget Thor Ragnarok. &&Well, it's an MIB movie. I don't know what would've indicated that he DIDNT have a funny role in the movie&&well, eskyous me then&&Oh man never knew how I badly I wanted a MIB film from Taika. That would be amazing &&The word reboot has just come to be used for too many different kinds of things.&&It's a sequel. What you're saying is basically like saying the new Star Wars movies are reboots.&&What's the difference between a spinoff and a soft reboot?&&I think that was a legitimate thing that was going to happen but didn't pan out. Like, not even as a joke lol.&&>Tbfh

To be frankly honest?&&Sony doesn't like making money, or good movies.&&Seriously that movie was great! &&OMG yes please.  That movie had some of the coolest sci-if details:  the solar sails that use starlight to power the ships, Jim’s freakin solar surfer (who doesn’t dream of having one of those?!) the Cyborg’s mechanical arm that could change into a sword or a robotic hand or those teeny grabby things for smaller stuff, the sickle moon space station port,  that map (of course), and the 3D hologram storybook from the prologue.  And it was all so beautifully animated...  Goddamn, It’s practically begging to be given another chance.&&They should remake this movie, but set it in the Caribbean in the 1800’s.&&Not the best example for me as RIPD is one of my guilty pleasure movies, but no, I know exactly what you mean and I completely understand why they do what they do. I just wish they would sprinkle in riskier choices here and there.&&On the other hand, Dredd and the Daredevil tv series.  Both were terrible movies, rebooted and done right.&&Jumper, Gamer, Cowboys vs Aliens, R. I. P. D,
Hancock, Transcendence, In Time, The Spirit, Terminator Salvation, Suicide Squad?&&[deleted]&&I don't know, man. Throw a dart in any direction and you'll hit a failed movie. Off the top of my head, Waterworld and Golden Compass would be a start.

And I know why they don't do it. I just wish they would try it every now and then.&&Dungeons and Dragons (2000)&&Eragon&&Dark City&&Relic - Maybe just skip the reboot and go straight to the next books in series. 

Super mario brothers live action was awesome in its own way - but maybe a reboot. 

The Hobbit. Same cast - One epic film. 

Dragon Ball Z, The Last Airbender, Enders game.

&&The Room!

But this time with a massive budget, a-list stars, explosions, etc!&&Avatar TLA&&Stargate.

It was such a cool concept but the execution just sucked. &&But all those movies you just listed were successful originals...&&I wouldn't mind seeing something in the same universe, but I think we've long since missed the boat on a direct sequel. Hell, that's one time I'm not sure a prequel would be a terrible idea. Mal had a lot of past that could be explored.&&Oof, there'd be no way the fans would accept it with a new cast though. Far far too iconic a cast to replace. In fact I'd say the cast is at least 50% of why people like it.&&I was correcting the title, I didn't bother to read the article &&Tommy Lee Jones has *Wilford Brimley Syndrome* (aka. ""Premature Old Man Face"" or 'POMF'.)&&*Vulcano and yes.&&I think everyone just calls everything a reboot now no matter what it is because people can't be bothered to not be stupid&&AKA soft reboot&&Which sounds great! If it's a good story I don't see any problems with making more movies in the MiB universe.&&Ideas were already used up before William Shakespear rebooted Romeo and Juliet.&&Tons of original movies are released everyday&&Yeah but that’s because there are decades worth of source material and various iterations of the character to tap into. They aren’t really running out of ideas, it’s just easy to translate an already existing story of a beloved character into a movie and see a huge ROI.

I don’t disagree with the point, I’d just use an example of something like Jurassic World or all the Halloween movies as a better example of too many reboots/sequels than a comic character.&&> They've rebooted Spiderman at least 3 times

Their rights to Spiderman depend on them using the IP on a certain timescale.  

No release within a certain time frame after the last = No IP rights.&&I loved that movie. It really baffles me why it gets so much hate. It obviously isn't Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction, but it's still a really fun movie with a lot of memorable moments. &&I dunno, I liked it &&A giant mechanical spider isn’t an A-level script?&&> Liam Neeson

""I've got full blown AIDS.""&&I don't think Liam was in the editing booth for that.&&That was my favorite scene in Schindler's List to be fair. &&Someone get this guy on the screenwriting team.&&Thats too smart for Sony bro. &&Or he's in charge of the firearms or other accessories, and he drags out the scene by asking a lot of ""what's your preference"" type questions. :)

It was confusing.&&But I thought Australians were British people with Sun Madness &&Hey, Korg still had Taika's native accent.&&And ""foreign"" is a new addition that popped up sometime around the Renaissance period.  Almost everyone was British before that which explains why you hear people talking British in any movie set in ancient Rome.&&and Ayrab&&Foreigners all have British accents (in movies and shows). We need to keep it simple. &&Bro. Aussies were the bad guys of so many 80s movies. They aren't unknown, just long forgotten.&&To think that there was an 'American' dub of Mad Max.&&That’s totally wrong. Americans merely have a ridiculous cartoonish impression of Aussies. &&What? We've had so many obviously Australian nationalities in film. Shrimp on the barbie, koalas, the great outback, Americans know Australia more than they know Canada&&lol this is funny cause you're basically saying Americans can buy a movie about aliens existing among us, but not Australians.&&Yeah it's MIB: TNG&&Yeah, its more than big enough of a concept for there to be all kinds of stories. J&K were just a small portion of MIB's business. &&>recasting J and K

This makes me want JK Simmons in the place of Rip Torn&&One of my biggest pet peeves is the misuse of “reboot” and outlets slowly creeping its definition to include remakes.

Remake = retelling a story and recasting characters
Reboot = making a sequel to a dormant series

Time for a re-watch. &&He was in Star Trek? &&[deleted]&&I watched thor ragnarok on a whim last week, with very low expectations. Hemsworth was amazing. Honestly I think he's out of place playing super heroes and should move into more comedy. MIB seems like a really good place to do that.&&Ditto for Ragnarok, Hemsworth stood out in a movie full of brilliant stars on top of their game.&&It came out a few years ago, starred Ed Helms. It was alright. &&National Lampoon's Vacation.  They kinda re-made it, except they just called it Vacation, and its about the son (Russ) taking his family to Wally World.  I'm a huge fan of the old National Lampoon movies (Christmas Vacation being my all time fav), but I haven't seen the remake so I can't tell you more then that.&&You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.&&If you come too fast during sex just reboot.&&I usually think of a spin-off as taking a side character and making them the lead in a new movie (e.g. Evan Almighty). Soft reboot is introducing new characters, with maybe a cameo from a character in the originals, to relaunch the franchise (e.g. Jurassic World).&&Better Call Saul was spun off of Breaking Bad where their stories align together. Star Trek's trilogy with Chris Pine was a soft reboot where, yes, it's Star Trek but it's story doesn't necessarily align with the previous installments/shows and has the flexibility of not being constrained to what happened in those stories.&&it was. It was in the ""hacked"" documents from Sony&&F is always fuck&&In all seriousness, its probably just to weird. Will smith and TLJ weren't going to be in it, so you'd just be making 21 jump street but they scream about aliens

Dont reboot this. 

Just remake the second half and do it fucking right this time.

* C vs. A - too soon, and man that had everything going right for it, that's risky to try again.
* RIPD - How would you fix it?
* Hancock - Now that we're in the age of superhero movies, including Deadpool, what does this look like?  Where does it fit?
* Transcendence, In Time, The Spirit, Terminator Salvation - didn't see, but we'll never stop getting Terminator movies.
* Suicide Squad - DC cinematic is a giant mess, don't get me started.&&I actually really enjoyed In Time&&Personally I would love to see more of the Push universe.

At what point will a reboot start filming at the same time as the original?&&I haven't seen Repo Men, but if you're down with musicals, there is a film based on a play called Repo! The Genetic Opera that has the EXACT same concept. Its directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II) and it stars a crazy cast. Alexa Vega (Spy kids) Anthony Stuart Head (Buffy) Paris Hilton (Not even gonna mention) Sarah Brightman (OG Christine from Phantom of the Opera on Broadway) I would recommend the film on the experience alone. Hearing the above mentioned sing together is an interesting experience, plus the visuals are striking. Both the film and the play it was based on came out before Repo Men as well. &&Pretty sure Golden Compass is being rebooted as a BBC series &&Kumail Nanjiani as an armored bear please&&They better keep their hands off Waterworld. It may have been a failure, but it's a goddamned treasure as it is.&&Man, Golden Compass .... what a wild ride that series turned out to be. Thought it was about a kid fleeing from a witch, turned out it was about [her KILLING GOD then going to live on a planet with Elephant People] (#spoiler)

I've never really looked up the definition of reboot or whatever, so I totally could have just misinterpreted that.  

Doing a quick google search, it seems like it might be a bit vague.  Or maybe that's just the current useage of the word after being used incorrectly for a while or whatever.  Dictionary.com lists the definitions as:

>1. to restart (a computer) by loading the operating system; boot again.

>2. to produce a distinctly new version of (an established media franchise, as a film, TV show, video game, or comic book).

>3. to make a change in (something) in order to establish a new beginning.

I can see the second definition being a bit vague.  A distinctly new version could imply new characters but not necessarily, I suppose.

Top 20 movie lines for me. &&This quote from a reviewer is accurate enough

>Up to this point, the movie had an extremely interesting subtext going for it. It seemed to be an inquiry into the fate in society of the great black superstar jock. Think Kobe, think Shaq, think LeBron, think Michael. These guys are so phenomenally gifted they seem to defy not just gravity and physics but also cause and effect, death, taxes and the rule on no free lunch. But . . . at the same time, they are marginalized, freakified, exiled, dehumanized, exploited, objectified and generally turned into product. That can't be fun and the wages of such treatment on the soul has never been directly treated in a movie.
>
>So as I say: It's kind of unusual, it's kind of amusing (I enjoyed Smith's subversive anger at ""the little people"" and his hunger for the cure-all brown beverage), and then the movie takes the strangest turn in quite possibly movie history, which I will not disclose. It's as if the screenwriters were working in their bungalow one day, stuck on a plot point, and one said to the other, ""What if --"" and the other said, ""No way,"" and the first said, ""Okay, genius, you come up with something better!"" and genius never did.
>
>The movie changes course, tone, concern, story issue, everything so abruptly and never recovers as it goes on to become a very strange thing. But of course they never explain it. That may be the most insane part, the fact that no theory is ever broached by which the oddness and what follows is fit into any kind of context. I suppose the term I'm looking for is ""creation myth,"" which ""Hancock"" boldly lacks.

But TLDR; the second half of the movie was so different from the first its like they stole it from another movie.

Imagine if Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane had been the first and second half of the same, instead of being two different movies. That was Hancock.

I remember reading at one point that this was likely do to the number of times the movie was handed to different people throughout its production, even going through multiple directors. &&He did, but he barely had any star power then.

The man with boots has blue jeans, but still has the short sleeved jacket. 

""Roit awful, these buggahs."" says the senior officer. Played by Chris Hemsworth. 

""Jeez-O-Pete, that son-bitch is huge! We got them back home but they ain't *that* big. ***DANG***."" says the new recruit, an Appalachian. Played by Shia Labouf. He takes a swig from a bourbon-filled canteen through a scraggly beard. 

We watch as the two approach a bonfire surrounded by two junkers and a couple of natives. We see one Asian man leading a conversation. 

""Ay y'all! Watch y'all up to at this time-a night?"" shouts Shia. 

""Roit! This lad saw ye from the road and we thought we moit check on these blokes! Doin' all roit?!"" follows Chris. He grabs Shias collar and gives him a stern look. High pitch violins set the ominous tone. 

""Oh, yes, we are doing very well, thank you. We apologize for the noise and potential confusion. We will quiet our festivities if we are causing any trouble."" says the Asian man. The natives nod quickly before lowering their heads.

Chris walks up to the Asian man with a sense of authority. ""Ohhh, no need. We just thought we'd check."" 

Shia follows suit and wraps an arm around a native. ""Oh sure. We were just bein a couple good sameritans and all that. Youns seemed to be havin a caniption or somethin, but y'all seem alright now that we got a good close look."" Shia hands the native his flask. The native nervously sips. 

""Now I wouldn't say that just yet."" Chris says quietly as he tightly grips the Asian man's scalp, pulling back his skin, as if it were a mask. An alien skull becomes visible through the thin covering. ""Roit. Aren't beings from the Alpha-134 Quadrant under a direct 'No Crossing' order? This is a galactic felony. Do you know this.""

The alien struggles, gasping through his disguise. ""Oh, yes, we know. We are very sorry. A terrible tyrant has overthrown our government. We are but stowaways searching for prosperity!"" 

""Prosperity! Well, shoot. That's what we're all about!"" says Shia ""if y'all want some-a that pursuit of happiness, then ya shoulda just said so. Whatcha say, C? Should we let em be?"" 

""Hold on, S. Alien Asian Man, what's this blokes name? The man who made you flee to the bloody desert?"" says Chris. He loosens his grip. The alien chokes, catching his breath. 

""Oh, he is horrendously horrid. Quite the worst, honestly. He goes by Shaka. He wishes to spread his rule. In fact, part of our journey is to warn the Earthlings, you, that he will be here within a week. Fully armed."" says the alien. 

""Well, Dang. That ain't good."" says Shia ""C, whatcha think 'bout this tale? Is he truthful?"" 

""I'm not sure, S."" says Chris ""but I do know that I spy 2 handles of Beam in that junkah.""

""I'll be, you got some eyes on you, son! You ain't kiddin!"" says Shia. ""We joinin' or we shootin?"" 

Chris gives another stern look to Shia, then to the natives, then to the alien. He smiles. ""What kinda hosts would we be if we didn't drink with our guests! May we, Alien Asian Man? We'll make sure youre taken care of tomorrow. Can't say much about the hangover, tho."" 

Shia runs to each of the natives, shaking their hands. ""Shoo fire, Imma bout to get lit y'all! Campfire drinkin's my favorite. Just absolute favorite! I apologize in advance for any bruises I may cause, though. I ain't got good control over my temperament when I'm blasted. Love you, though. Remember that."" The natives seem a little concerned again. 

The alien man goes from concerned to excited. ""But of course! Let us make merry! My friends, family, we have found freedom!"" 

As the group drinks and has fun, probably with a pop song playing in the background, we rise to the stars and blast toward a fucking massive Klingon-looking ship. We see Shaka. He's a mean motherfucker who looks like a giant cracked-out koala. He clenches his fist, garnished in extravagant jewelry. The stones are the mini galaxies from the first movie.

Ignoring the comics and going by what they probably have seen (movies), then both Superman and Batman have killed before. Batman being the more murderous.

I mean if you didn't like the new movies, fine, just don't go out of your way to make up flaws that aren't there. I remember when they released the first pictures of the batmobile in BvS and Reddit lost their shit complaining that Batman doesn't have guns in his car, but he totally does. &&I'm just going to assume he wrote the good first half and I don't want anyone to ruin this for me.

First image of Wonder Woman in WONDER WOMAN 1984!,31606,8qsccg,https://i.redd.it/uprqrasmqr311.jpg,1954,1528895810.0,,"Patty Jenkins also released another image from WW84 today, but because it involves what seems to be a major spoiler and because this one is already at the top of the sub we aren't allowing it since it's getting reported like mad for spoilers.

Anyways, if you want to see the image and possible spoilers, [here ya go](https://i.redd.it/z9nku221or311.jpg).

&&Ohh Dallas is on!&&if patty goes full neon 80s synthwave with this I'm 1000% game&&The title, the grungy logo, the year it takes place and the focus on TVs in this still makes me wonder if they are going to go down a slightly Orwellian route, which would be a very weird direction to take a Wonder Woman movie. I am intrigued.&&Spoilers from Wonder Woman below:


Not sure I dig the fact that Chris Pine is returning. That kind of lessens the emotional impact of his death in the first film. I hope Jenkins has a good explanation for this.&&the 80s, **so** in right now.

edit: I feel like anyone can make this comment and get 500+ upvotes if you just hit the thread at the right time. 

edit 2: hmu on xbox, my gamertag is 
**Xxtra low effort xX**

&&That hair is luscious.&&This is super intriguing, but the title's kind of odd I think, unless the sequels are always gonna named after the timeframe they're set in.&&Reminds me of Veidt's control room from Watchmen.  &&I think I recognize the bottom left screen as scrambled cable porn from my childhood. 

In about three minutes, those green squiggles are going to resolve into a wiggly, pinkish-purple breast where you can totally see a pale blue nipple for about half a second.

...I'll be in my bunk.&&[SOURCE](https://twitter.com/GalGadot/status/1006887729618194432)&&Crap. I missed Wonder Woman 2 - Wonder Woman 1983. Could someone fill me in with what happened? &&The first one was great, I’m excited to see how this one turns out! &&You can tell it's the 1980s by the way that it is&&Lynda Carter having a cameo in this one would be cool!&&Apparently the designer thinks all TV broadcast in 1984 had noise and glitches.&&Needs more Max Headroom.&&[removed]&&They are currently or just finished filming at a dead shopping mall near my home in northern Virginia. The mall definitely still has all the 80s style and decor so it should be a good fit. &&I think that's Larry Hagman in *Dallas* on the one screen.

Did Wonder Woman shoot JR?

God, if that's the plot of this movie, take all of my money right now. &&I’m a little worried we’re overextending our 80s nostalgia.&&DC fucking up the timeline again but I'm here for it&&I want her to get to the 90s and she tries and saves biggie and tupac but fails cos of some crazy alien shit &&I am probably alone in this but why the 80s? Haven't we gotten an origin film and seen her in 2 present day movies? Couldn't a story around Barbara take place after Justice League?&&Yo dawg! I heard you liked 80's references&&I’d have loved to be in the writing room when the producers pitched this. 

‘So you all saw Guardians right?’

‘Yeah’

‘And Ready Player One?’

‘Uh huh’

‘Well guess what...’

‘Oh fuck’&&They are currently or just finished filming at a dead shopping mall near my home in northern Virginia. The mall definitely still has all the 80s style and decor so it should be a good fit.

&&Hyped!!!&&The hard grain on the TVs is distracting and makes them look really fake. Old tube TVs always looked a lot softer.&&I found out long ago,

OooOOOooooh

It's a long way down the holiday road,

OooOOOoooo-ooh



Holiday rooOOOOoooOOoad...
Holiday rooooOOOOOooOooad... &&Hold on, I thought she was supposed to have not shown herself after what happened to Steve? Isn’t that what Batman said? 

I may have misremembered things so please enlighten me. &&You know it's 1984 because of the subtle references on the televisions!&&Wonder Woman 1: Who caused World War I?

Wonder Woman 2: Who shot JR?&&I keep hearing people complaining about 80s nostalgia but I feel that having a movie thats actually set in the 80s is different than making a movie that makes homage to popular movies that came out in the 80s. &&Guys, I think this movie will probably be set in the 80's.&&This is filming down the street from my office right now&&They’re filming in front of the Hirshhorn museum today in DC&&Is she in Ozymandia's lair? &&Looks awesome!&&This is gonna be glamorous as hell and visually stunning, I'm hyped&&So I guess we're going to all forget that the first one started with Bruce Wayne giving wonder woman the only photo in existence of her dead boyfriend, where she acts like this is the first time she's seen him since WWI. &&""It's like Wonder Woman, but in 1984!""&&I think WB could get a lot of mileage out of wiping everything but Wonder Woman from the canon and re-bootstrapping their cinematic universe from there. &&Oh hell yeah.  I can see the hint of the cropped ‘80s bomber jacket and I am so here for it.&&""Wonder Woman, your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control, which has led you, inexorably, here.""&&and I bet it's going to be a half hour too long and outstandingly okay&&Wonder Woman stops the Cold War from escalating into World War III? I am so *in*.&&I'm ready for some Gal Gadot in neon and shoulder pads&&I love the title so much more than ""Wonder Woman 2""&&You just know what JR is thinking.&&Ooo triangles and technicolor! So 80's!&&She is truly so beautiful it hurts.&&Bold move to skip Wonder Woman 2-1983&&I'm glad people are finally going out of their way to show the 80s in art. It's really a decade that doesn't get enough attention or appreciation.&&I for one am tired of the 80's theme in everything recently, oh well&&Spice channel in the bottom left. 1984 confirmed. &&as much as i liked the first wonder woman, seeing that they brought chris pine back really disappoints me.  if he's just visions she sees sometimes and not really there or integral to the plot, why release a promo picture of him?  ugh.  dceu.

giving zack snyder the keys and establishing things like wonder woman turning her back on mankind for 100 years or have jonathan kent teach superman to hide instead of help.  what the fuck was warner brothers thinking.&&I like how you can only subtly tell what year is. /s&&*Muted Darkwave Playing in the Distance.*&&Wait, 1984 as in George Orwell? That sounds kind of awesome&&Wonder Woman 2049&&As a person born in 82, I am stoked.&&Maybe she had time to take acting lessons since the last one.&&This image is the most color I've ever seen in a DCEU movie. I'm all for them making a cheesy, tongue in cheek movie that's just radical fun. Like Thor 3&&“The numbers Jason; what do they means”&&Looks way cool! But there really wasn’t THAT much static in our TV pictures.&&I still struggle with how they portrayed the limits of her powers in the first movie. From the comics I saw her as invulnerable, athletic, strong, good with weapons, etc but by the end of the movie she exhibited god-like I can move matter powers in order to fight the overly powerful bad guy. I wish they could pump the brakes a bit. &&I hope se was going to have curly long hair like the 80s George Perez version. :(&&So do I have to watch Wonder Womans 2 through 1983 to understand the plot of this one?&&Damn, did I wake up from a coma? How are they already in movie number 1,984?&&And Christie Brinkley driving in ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" I think.&&""Who shot J.R.?""

""Ares.""&&And that's Dallas&&I thought it was Cal Worthington&&I was once on Dallas.&&One of the best TV theme tunes ever.&&I hope Debbie does it&&DALLAS WAS THE SHIT!&&Imagine a synthwave version of the WW theme&&/r/outrun 

And get Carpenter Brut to do the soundtrack.&&The picture of Steve Trevor shows him wearing a Member's only jacket.&&*cough* thor ragnarok *cough*&&The WW theme is replaced with Nightcall&&so you mean, copy the aesthetic of Thor?
&&Who controls the past, controls the future. &&I immediately though of Ozymandius in front of his TV screens from Watchmen&&I too think that’s it kinda weird but in a so weird it works kinda way. 
Also it would be refreshing to see a superhero period piece actually be one by fully embracing that period elements, instead of the time element being just in the background like most.&&Is this not obvious? &&Which is interesting, because I can't see that type of subterfuge being (Minerva) Cheetah's thing either. So either they're changing up Cheetah to make it more of a Cold War thriller, or there will be another surprise villain.&&Yeah, completely agree. &&I like it because we have a lot of icon superheroes, like captain america, but we rarely see them confront modern political issues, and for obvious reasons, they avoid them. But I think its time to see these heroes show us what they really stand for&&Steve Trevor became a green lantern in the cockpit of that plane before he was supposed to die.

""Steve Trevor, you have demonstrated tremendous willpower and the ability to overcome great fear...""

Or at least that's how it played out in my head.&&I'm hoping that Chris Pine will just show up in flashbacks. Or maybe as an inner voice-type scene. &&I bet Circe is going to have an appearance then bring Steve Trevor back to mess with Diana, only to lose him again.&&Maybe it's his son? &&Here's the thing. A good scene is scene that exists on its own. It doesn't matter what happens afterwards

If Chris Pine coming back ruins that scene. Then it wasn't a good scene in the first place.&&Chris Pine was a great element of that movie. I honestly don't think I would mind that much,so long as there's a good reason behind it. Its a piece of superhero fiction, of course people are going to be pointlessly resurrected!&&Also, it's a big jump to go from 1918 to 1984. I really hope they address how she reacted to WW2, Vietnam, the Civil Rights Movement etc. Otherwise, I'm gonna find it very hard to get behind a ""superhero"" who managed to ignore the world's atrocities because of her own heartbreak. &&Even more than it was 30 years go&&[deleted]&&If Captain Marvel is a hit I could see people start playing around with the 90s. &&The 80s have literally never been out for my entire 25 years of existence.  We had 80s day during spirit week all through school even tho none of us where born later than 1990.&&Even in the 90’s Eighties night was huge in the night clubs.&&[deleted]&&I'm so tired of it at this point. I rolled my eyes watching the trailer of Bumblebee.&&That goes for most comments to be fair.&&People who were young in the 80's are now the ones in charge of the media, expect 90's to be big in 10-20 years...although I really would rather not...&&Gal Gadot is beyond just being attractive. She's on a level that genuinely isn't fair.&&That hair needs to be a lot bigger if it's the 80s.&&[deleted]&&Definitely more interesting than just Wonder Woman 2: \[Subtitle\]. &&Fast and Furious hasn’t even gotten up to 1984 yet&&It's going to get really confusing if they make 1983 more Wonder Woman movies. &&When I first heard about it, the working title reminded me of how a lot of internetters (including me) use *Batman ‘89* when referencing that particular movie. &&Well watchmen are in the DC now&&For real, if they weren't moving around much, it was pretty clear. I mean, the boobs were neon, but otherwise, not too shabby.&&I doubt that is a practical shoot. The entire thing could have been composited in photoshop alone.&&Stuff &&Lynda Carter, duh!&&a few Christmases, vacations, vietnam war... you know same ol same ol&&Basically Wonder Woman saved the world by causing  the video game crash.&&Wonder Woman 69 was a classic!&&It was weird.

Gal Gadot was replaced by Charlize Theron, and she went to Germany, and she met James McAvoy, and kicked half of Berlin's ass but oddly she didn't seemed to have superpowers in this movie.&&A lot of low hanging jokes. You'd like it.&&Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Kristin Wiig, and Pedro Pascal. 


I'm so hyped for this. &&As long as it's not her taking on a government conspiracy (ala 1984) only to somehow end in a big climactic blockbuster explosion-fest and blue sky beams for no reason.

The last act of WW really soured me to the whole movie. &&Neat.&&Well she does live in Virginia&&And not even the *right* noise or artifacts (that that nonsensical  mockery of the SMPTE bars). Though that's kind of a pet peeve. &&The tracking knob on the VCR couldn't always fix it. They probably need [to clean their VCR heads.](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-vcr-video-head-cleaner-white/8025035.p)

Seriously, I'm somewhat surprised these are still sold in 2018.&&[deleted]&&Only if the rabbit ears didn’t work. &&Early 84 for Max, so it’s a possibility. &&Woah, he survived?!&&Maybe it's a secret crossover with Star Trek.  Kirk went through the Guardian of Forever and ended up first in 1917 and was transported to 1984 before the plane blew up.  He used the name Steve Trevor to hide his identity.

So they’re retconning it &&im pretty sure they are retconing that stuff. Not sure why snyder had that established in bvs&&It's DC.  They don't know what the fuck there doing.

It got to be a thing in the later 90s and then definitely was a thing until maybe 2006 or so.  At least, that's when our local 80s club night died out.

- Hair higher in the reflection (should be slightly lower given low position of camera)

- Reflection shouldn't be visible (the reflecting glass presumebly being at a right angle to the lense).

- TVs are all copy and pasted.

- light on her face in the reflection only comes from the right =! TVs are about equal in brightness. Light looks a lot like studio setup.

They had zero idea what they were doing. &&It's a fucking comic book movie with about Wonder Woman fighting a humanoid cheetah God whose probably being manipulated by Circe, another God like witch person. Idk why people like you are wanting some grounded philosophical drama when these movies are first and foremost about dope cgi action sequences. 

If this movie doesn't end with a crazy cgi action set piece then I'll be super disappointed. 

It doesn't make sense to me at all.  This fucking sub will jizz all over MCU even though every single movie ends with over the top cgi action scenes. Fucking hypocrites. 

Sorry I had to rant this out. &&I was hoping she would be wrong, discover Ares wasn't real and come to terms that evil was inherent in mankind.

Silence.

Steve opens his eyes. He's inside a ball of green light. He looks around for Diana. 'Where am I?' he thinks to himself. He looks down. He's floating through the clouds, but there's no time to react as he is suddenly  descending down to an isolated beach save for an alien spacecraft that has crashed. Steve is gently laid down in front of Abin Sur, who is mortally wounded.

\>Abin Sur coughs blood, ""Looks like the ring found you right on time."" Abin Sur points to the mushroom cloud in the distance that was the bomber Steve was flying.

""The ring is always right. You won't believe it at first, I didn't either. Your old life, however, is gone. Appropriate that it seems whoever you were died in that explosion. You'll become more than you ever dreamed of, but you'll lose everything you had before.""  Abin collapses down to the ground further.

Steve rushes forward, and Abin holds up his hand. ""My time has come. Your time, however, is just beginning. ""

Abin closes his eyes.

Steve falls to his knees, dumbfounded at everything that just occurred.

""Steve Trevor of Earth, you have the ability to overcome great fear. Welcome to the Green Lantern Corps.""

The ring finds Steve's finger, and he vanishes in a stream of green light as he is transported to Oa to begin his training.

It's not particularly uncommon as a trope.

Like I had never heard that song before, and then I saw the trailer and was like holy shit that song is awesome.

I'm also glad they used it in the beginning, and at the end as well.&&I agree with you.  Hearing it earlier in the film affected it’s impact in the climax.

For the first fight, they should’ve just brought back the old Thor theme one last time.  Using Immigrant Sonng at the climax can show how Marvel is moving away from swords-and-sorcery Thor to cosmic Thor.&&I see where your coming from, but thematically I think that it does make sense to play it at the intro, and then during the climax. The first time that the song is played, its during a scene where we are seeing Thor at his best. He’s destroying these zombies with ease, and he is completely on top of things. After the initial plot kicks in, Thor loses everything and we have to watch him slowly regain his confidence and sense of self. The second time the ‘Immigrant Song’ plays is when he has reclaimed his identity as the God of Thunder and has gained back his mojo. It signifies that he’s back as his best self. If you look at the song as basically Thor’s theme, than it makes sense why it played twice in the film.&&I completely agree. When I first saw the movie and it played during the opening, I thought, ""Oh, huh. I thought this was going to be used later in the movie. Oh well."" Then it comes BACK on and my first thought was ""Wait... huh?"" rather than ""Oh fuck yeah.""&&His backhand hammer smash was too perfect though.  That song worl have matched with his rage and shouting.&&It was one of the moments that, in hindsight, was made for on-demand viewing so the people who get the joke can pause the show and laugh all they want. &&I think the point is that it already takes serious shenanigans for him to have survived the first movie either way.

If we ran with this idea though, it means Steve would have been quite old by the time the 80's rolled around, and even if he did somehow maintain those good looks while wearing the ring and was killed along the way or gave up the ring then died, what happened to the ring that Steppenwolf proclaimed Earth as ""free of Lanterns"". &&That'd be weird, I don't think anything has been announced with regards to Circe but we know that Kristen Wiig is playing the bad guy - Cheetah.

Sooo he could seriously still be alive or resurrected? &&and SHE'LL BEAT HER FOES until they're DEAD OR YIIIIIIEEEELD!&&Well, it's comic books. I'm assuming the resolution for him surviving is going to be something like clone, alternate timeline, wormhole, saved by a god, etc. There is no mundane explanation for surviving this particular explosion.

And we're supposed to guess whatever it's supposed to mean I'm guessing, right?&&It's looking like either Hallucinations or resurrection. Since Cheetah is in the film and Circe is an integral part of her origin, we may be seeing some necromancy.&&Come on, man.

"Animation Workers Set To Receive $170 Million Payout From Wage-Theft Lawsuit (From The Walt Disney Company/Pixar/Lucasfilm/Imagemovers Digital, Sony, Dreamworks, 21st Century Fox)",31287,8uo0rr,https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/animation-workers-set-to-receive-170-million-payout-from-wage-theft-lawsuit-161482.html,928,1530224942.0,,"$170 million seems like a lot, right?

I copied the list of [elligible in-class job titles](http://www.animationlawsuit.com/in-class-job-titles.aspx) into Excel, and it's 2,117 long. That's only JOB TITLES. According to IMDb, over 1,700 visual effects crew members worked on Avengers: Infinity War.

Once again, VFX workers get screwed.&&I am a member of this class action lawsuit. (At last report, there are 11,000 members in this suit)  I worked at Dreamworks for nearly a decade so I am covered in the time period for which this lawsuit addresses.   

The case itself is very clear on an evidence-standpoint.  Ed Catmull, the head of Pixar, made several published public statements not only admitting to but bragging and justifying this illegal practice of colluding with these top studio execs to not hire from each other's labor pool in order to suppress wages and suppress worker mobility.
Here is a good source that outlines the scheme and the broad reach that affected workers within animation but also beyond the entertainment industry and all the way to high tech industries:
https://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/ed-catmull-on-wage-fixing-i-dont-apologize-for-this-105855.html


I do know of people who were surprised that despite talent and achievement, were not processed through a hiring process.  Dreamworks and Disney are about 5 minutes from each other in Glendale and Burbank.  

What these top execs did is a morally evil thing.  They acted in full knowledge that they were violating federal anti-trust laws.  They did it deliberately to save money and by fucking over their own artists who poured their passion, their best years of their lives, to give their best effort to put out great work.  

While the timeframe of the lawsuit covers approximately 6-7 years, the lawsuit is an offshoot of the even larger ""High Tech lawsuit"" where Google, Apple, and other high tech silicon valley companies did the exact same thing (Remember, Steve Jobs ran Pixar for some time).  This made this lawsuit a lot easier for the plaintiff lawyers to pursue in court. This is why the plaintiff attorney fees were reduced to $18M by the judge after they had initially asked for over $38M.  The bulk of the legal groundwork had already been laid down so they didn't have to do as much work to present their case.

This is nothing less than wage theft.  Worse - career theft.  People never got to enjoy their full opportunity because of this cartel controlling things like an unbelievable conspiracy theory.  These companies are settling for what seems like a huge amount of money but it is still just a fraction of what they likely saved by implementing this covert, illegal scheme of unifying against the workers.

The animation artists at Disney and Dreamworks had a labor union (Local 839a, Animation Guild) yet that did not help because this pattern of corporate malfeasance was done covertly.  Sony, Blue Sky, Pixar are not union shops so they were probably even more screwed over by a variety of other practices beyond this particular one.

It's a really fucked up situation when talented artists are screwed over for a decade.  That's a whole career for some.  It was for me.

I came from a videogame 3D art background and put a few years in digital visual effects before moving onto feature animation.  The people I worked with were great and dedicated.  

Today Dreamworks sold out to Comcast and they laid off most of its USA artists in favor of offshored labor in China and India.  American animation (and our friends in VFX) gets beaten up by unethical executives all the time with no real consequences.  &&So on average, how much is each person estimated to receive?&&Not enough&&Good. I hope it changes the industry. I'm an animator and I hear horror stories constantly.&&Animators are a sorely overlooked group. Storyboard artists, designers, rigging, keying, layout, backgrounds, texture, compositers, etc etc.

Almost all my friends work in animation across LA, and almost all of them are taken advantage of. They get paid average rates that barely cover the constantly inflating living cost of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, these features films are banking huge profits that go in the pockets of everyone else.

You know when you watch an animated film and there’s that one gag that stuck with you? That was a storyboard artist. One person did that thing that made the cartoon stick in your mind.

TV animation is a bit different in that the form of broadcast is dying, and there’s not much money flying around. 

But feature film, I think artists should get some kind of stake in the project they’re making happen. If I spent 5 months working on a film that made three quarters of a billion dollars, I’d really like to know why I’m still living in the bad part of town, barely able to pay my bills.

&&I know it's far more complicated than just saying ""they need to unionise"" but they seriously need to do something. Every other aspect of the industry is so tied up in unions it's kind of ridiculous FX companies are not in there too.&&> The money is coming from The Walt Disney Company/Pixar/Lucasfilm/Imagemovers Digital, which settled for $100 million; Dreamworks Animation, which settled for $50 million; Sony Pictures, which settled for $13 million; and 21st Century Fox-owned Blue Sky Studios, which settled for $5.95 million. Most animation workers who were employed at those companies between 2004 and 2010 qualify to receive a portion of the settlement. 

Still could be higher, to be honest. Either way, well deserved for those borderline-abused animation people.&&Probably get $10 each.&&I left the industry after 20 years because of crap like this. I just couldn't see the longevity of it.

Companies have been cutting rates for years, long hours, constantly having to worry about companies not paying, it fucking sucked and I was sick of feeling like I had no options. All the companies exist in a few cities around the world, most of them with a very high cost of living. It was fun, met a lot of cool people, worked on a lot of cool projects, but I'm way happier now.&&Fuck Ed Catmull and the rest of the execs responsible for this.&&Good, hope this mistreatment gets more attention and becomes a bigger story so most people know.

Then again Disney may be threatening to blacklist people.&&Every single VFX studio out there could win this battle if they all agreed to simply stop doing VFX work.

This would be catastrophic but a strike is really the only proper way to settle this because shit ain't gonna change otherwise. &&Whatever happened to the folks who made Sausage Party? Not the big names but the VFX people, didn't they get stiffed?&&> The plaintiffs in the lawsuit presented substantial evidence that implicated Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios president Ed Catmull as a ringleader of the illegal wage-fixing scheme. The Walt Disney Company has done nothing to reprimand or punish Catmull for his questionable actions, and he continues to serve as the leader for both Disney and Pixar animation studios.

Surprise! The people who are really at fault here don't get punished!&&Good. Keep it coming. Get yo money, animators and vfx folks. Seriously hard work and time consuming that takes an enormous amount of talent and goes underappreciated. So many people get screwed over, quit the industry and talent that wins Oscars can't keep the lights on.&&Animators always get shafted. In every time period, and every country, animators are overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated.&&PSA: Anti competitive behavior will only get worse with more consolidation.&&Ed Catmull? I loved his book...this is heartbreaking. Why would he do this while claiming to treat his employees with respect?&&So it's actually getting paid out from Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney, Sony, Dreamworks, and Disney. There seems to be something fairly common with this wage theft thing.

edit: Also why is there a distribution time? Why aren't they paying out immediately? It's a punishment after all. They certainly didn't steal all that money in little increments. If the company has to sell off assets to cover the payout than good. That might help stem the monopolizing of IP and numerous other similar forms of pay rigging.&&great news!!&&Its about time.  Animation and videogame companies have been forcing artists to work nonstop without overtime since day one.
They call it crunch time.  EA got sued and is one of the few companies that pays its workers hourly.  

I mean its pretty simple..  if you get a fixed salary, so if you work overtime,  then thats your bad. 

Basically being an artist is a dream job so people just do whatever theyre told.
&&/u/Unfinishedmeal please crosspost this to /r/Animation. Set it to news flair.&&The Cartoon Cartel&&Knowing how hard it is to break into that profession, and how hard these people work, that is pretty damn sleezy. &&Animators and VFX people don't get nearly enough credit, i.e. smaug in the hobbit, everyone is always bragging about Cumberbatch's voice, but the real hero's who brought smaug to life are the VFX artists and sound guys.&&The fact that Catmull didn't get fired is fucking less than pathetic.
I can't believe that someone who admittedly started this and continued to do it, is nothing short of amazing.
Disney really is the root of all evil.&&so i see we have made it to the ""stealing from our underpaid workers""  stage of late capitalism.  &&Need something like this in the anime/cartoon industry.&&It should be more. Disney has 80 billion dollars to spare they should be able to pay their animators wayyyyy than that. Still a decent payout but hell that should be a billion split between them all. There are hundreds of animators for any given movie, pay them and maybe the sub par cgi will become transcendent cgi&&Someone should start a new animation company from the ground up. The execs are nothing without all the people working for them. &&That's only $15,454 per person...... How the hell are they getting away with only paying that much.&&Just a reminder that wage theft takes more from working folks than what we traditionally consider theft, such as muggings and home robberies.

I've never met a boss in a major corporation that didn't steal from their employees. Detail every hour you work carefully, every break you don't get, every half hour of overtime pay that isn't 1.5x your normal hourly, etc.&&[deleted]&&Didn’t this happen with tech companies too??&&I look forward to my check for 75 cents in the mail...&&Everyone gets $6!!&&Is it sad that I don't feel anything? The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. Especially in the show biz, the people are overworked and underpaid. Everything is shady and those who are well paid get the lion's share of the money. The bottom feeders get practically nothing.

It's happening all the time all over the world and it's not going to stop or get better. It's just how the economy works.&&I keep saying that Disney is a shitty company. Working with them in almost any aspect has been shown to be awful, from video games (Marvel vs Capcom Infinite, Battlefront 2), the ""Mickey Mouse Law"" to bring treated poorly as a worker. 

Yeah, they produce amazing content, such as the many movies that have been coming out over the last few years, but like any mega company they're still to work with. &&hell yea baby no bootlickers in these comments.&&But the *exposure*

/s&&Lol, 171 million out of billions made. Hardly deems the word compensation. &&Their lawyers get 170 mil... the actual workers probably get coupons for frozen yogurt.&&It's so fucking ridiculous how weak and captured our American government is. I fucking hate it. &&I wanted to pursuit digital fx, but once I realized they were getting the shaft from the studios.. I went into finance. &&Being a VFX worker is great in some ways and sucks in so many other. Being able to create amazing VFX work is not that hard anymore in theory - its just incredibly labour intensive when you try to do it on a block buster scale.

It is now almost completely price driven. If you tick the box of quality, its all about price and speed. If you work at Animalogic in Sydney for example you may earn $70K per year or similar but you are competing against someone in India that earns $7K. There are almost no profits to be made for the VFX houses and salaries are coming down. Companies are going under.

Those who make money are the owners of the IP - Disney etc. For anyone studying VFX and animation I'd say don't. From an hourly salary point of view almost any job has better pay. And being one of 100 3D riggers on a film is hardly creative. Alternative, get into gaming, thats where the money is. For now.&&Jesus Christ. I worked for pixar a long time ago. This is the second lawsuit from which I'm going to benefit after the fact. That studio was a great place to work, but given this, the tech company apple/pixar/etc settlement and the lasseter shit, that place needs to shut down. &&So everyone gets about $20?  &&While I was attending school (2010-2014)  I quickly noticed how crappy the film and entertainment was as far as worker treatment so I decided to go down the architectural and product rendering road.  It has been a much better pay and environment.  I feel for my fellow artists in the industry that are pumping there very life essence into work only to be treated like disposable tools.&&You steal from the company, then you're ass is going to prison.

 It really makes you question if they realise how dedicated and skilled you have to be to create such beautiful animation you see coming from these companies? It's unreal the disconnect from fairness you have to have to conspire against fair wages for fair work.&&




Are there any animators here in this thread? I have always wanted to work in the industry but I have heard from a lot of animators in major studios saying it isn't all that its cracked up to be.

The only time I do, it's just for a quick paycheck and will dump them on a drop of the hat. For something I really care about, I'd rather do my own thing and own my own IP. The second you work for any company that's very large, they fuck you. It's better to play the lottery of success (what the American economy is anyway) and do what you love for yourself...not for some dead guys and a board of directors who's primary motivation will ALWAYS BE THE SHAREHOLDER. The workers are always a distance third in order of importance (customers being second). Always.

The good news is it's never been easier to do your own thing in the creative field now than in the entire history of mankind. The internet has an unlimited amount of teaching materials for a fraction of the price of college. It has countless means of networking with those who share your passion. Simply learn how to organize it, split profits fairly and in writing, don't fucking sell out to Google (Jesus, control your own destiny you cowards), and see it through to its end. Companies like Disney exist to destroy ideas and competition (see what they did to public domain). Stop feeding the beast.&&What's sad is this is chump change to Disney.

Now I'm super underwhelmed by the settlement. And it's only the first payment being given out. It could take years for them to get all of it.&&That's less than a year's salary for all of them&&There are just over 10000 people in the class.  It covers almost everybody other than upper level management and executives for multiple companies over a 6 year period.

The payout is based on total earnings at any of the companies during the 6 year period.  Divide that by the total amount earned by everyone in the class and that percentage is what you get from the settlement.

The case was settled over a year ago but the firm responsible for the payment (including finding total compensation) has kept changing its deadline.  It was supposed to first be resolved last October. Then Fall.  Then Winter.  The. January.  Then first quarter.  Then June.  Finally, half of the money gets sent out on July 9th, with the rest in August.   It has been difficult waiting all of this time, I can’t wait for it to be over.&&Back to green profile pics, then?

Sadly, there seems little that can be done to change the filthy practices.  There's just too much outbidding each other (on every level) and in the end most vfx houses will barely scrape by after the Nth rework of a shot that was paid for once.

Those still doing okay in Vancouver et AL know the writing is on the wall and will eventually leave the job if their passion does not outshine their desire for a reasonable income or try to become a supe/td over in one of the lower wages countries.  It's all but inevitable.

And then there's threads where people complain about lengthy credit scrolls forcing them to wait longer for their precious post-credits scenes, telling animators (and many others) that they don't care, that they got their money, and why would they need recognition in the credits; they don't get to write their names on burgers they flip / cars they build / spreadsheets they set up,and it's not like the credit roll folk are the actors/directors/producers.. You know, the only important people.

Yeah, VFX is a thankless industry, and I only know details of this from the minimum of overlap in my industry with theirs.  Insiders could probably spill some real beans if they weren't contractually obligated not to / wouldn't get blackballed.

&&The class action covers about 10,000-11,000 workers who qualify as members of the class.

&&Just to clarify - The job titles listed for this lawsuit, while cross-discipline with VFX directly, are for feature animation.

It's a field I fell in love with and reading this thread is kinda scaring me and leaving me kind of sad.

I've read Catmull's book and I've listened to a lot of podcasts from people in the industry who are either freelancers or have their ouw small motion graph/video game studio/youtube animation channel and every once in a while they get a question like ""What would you give to work for Disney?"". And every single time all of them answered ""I would not work for Disney if I could avoid it""

And up to this point I've been naively like what man these dudes are crazy they must have no idea what it is like to work for Disney whereas I totally do even though my experience in the industry is non-existent.

Ah na. I get it now.

All the best to you and I wish you the best of lucks&&Great post, I also worked for DW and I am with you, I have so many screwy stories. &&This is really sad.

Has this not been reported?  I can't find any indication that this is true.  &&Man. I've got a degree in animation for vfx/games. Never even got started on my career there because the pay was so shit and the work so sparse. Depressing.&&Holy shit that’s awful. Too bad it’ll be a 10.00 check for each person that was impacted by this crap once the lawyers have taken their cut. &&I admittedly don't know the full picture here but am also a 10+ year VFX artist (EDIT - by VFX I mean the whole scope of animation/modeling etc).


To play devils advocate here I'll list a few dot points that it'd be great to get your opinion on. (None of the below excuses ripping of artists, because I've been ripped off before).


- a) In my experience top artists can often be an issue. They work late hours with no pushback and enforce that as a rule to others, particularly juniors, until its essentially just an obligation and goes without saying. Its not unusual, even in crunch for most artists to stay back till 8 or 9 oclock every night *even* if their workload does not demand it. Its a cultural thing where everyone wants to look most dedicated.


- b) Top artists are often paid an extraordinary amount (usually deserved), but this usually means at the bottom end interns and juniors are paid garbage salaries. I was in a top studio for 1.5 years on *half* the minimum wage, while a few top artists had lighter workloads, openly took their time with shots and accepted a salary nearly 4 times mine (*EDIT - I estimate the rough 'minimum wage' as a low-paid CG artist here*). Is their some obligation on keeping top artists salaries reasonable, to also keep junior wages reasonable? (Should note - I'm not suggesting this would naturally happen of course). The last 2-3 years of work I was paid triple figure salaries and that's all I needed, and felt I deserved (this is hastily worded, but you get the general jist). 


- c) Movies are fucked. We dont *need* VFX. Movies have existed for decades without any overt VFX and hold up significantly better. This public need for VFX blockbusters is absurd - every month a new superhero movie comes out with some garrish action scene that you forget in a second, that probably involved a thousand peoples full year work and 20 million dollars. I don't *need* a closeup on that tigers whiskers that takes a month to do. I don't need ten thousand background characters all photoreal. Can't directors/artists innovate anymore? Its a silly push for more real VFX as if its integral to humanities growth, and we need to draw it back from the edge. Movie budgets should be much more constrained and a lower precedent for VFX included. Its extravagant nonsense that helps no-one.
&&I'm an artist for hire, I do custom work and being an animator has always been an unobtainable dream for me. 

It's sad that this boils down to the fact that people don't believe it's a real job. That doing art is easy, ""drawing is just fun why should we pay you."" People who don't have a clue and it's saddening to see that big corporations are no different than the people I talk to on a daily that would like to pay me in ""exposure, and it'll get your work out there"" 

DRAWING is hard and it's a skill that takes years and years to learn and master, why is this profession so disrespected?&&[deleted]&&[MFW I'm hoping my 2nd cousin isn't partly responsible for this ](https://i.imgur.com/0G1PBHd.gif)

It's not a team effort of a hardworking group to make something they all believe in, it's striving to fulfill the box office quota.

You poured out your heart and your soul and your sweat and it sounds like they fucking raped you guys. I hope you guys get something back. People are so fucking greedy. &&Not paying to see another Dreamworks movie again that's for sure.&&This is why i never went into VFX. Had an internship with the top VFX house in my country when i was in college and they were thirsting for new employees, had to hire in people from the UK constantly since they couldn't find enough people locally.

Either way when i was there it was a blast and i learned so much. But i also learned a few not so nice things. Pretty much everyone was divorced and they all told me that my relationship that i was in was doomed - i had to find a girl in the industry if i was to have a relationship, else they wouldn't understand the long hours. ANd they worked LONG hours, with 0 overtime pay, just because they were so dedicated to what they did and loved what they did. And this is in a country with actual labor laws compared to the US. Dropped my VFX dream after i was there and went into IT instead.&&> These companies are settling for what seems like a huge amount of money but it is still just a fraction of what they likely saved by implementing this covert, illegal scheme of unifying against the workers.

This, right here. You can bet your bottom dollar that the cost-benefit analysis of this decision was discussed in countless boardrooms. ""Yeah, we're going to have to pay out a shit-ton of money if this ever comes out, but in the meantime we're saving 10 times as much."" &&How likely is it that game companies are doing the same? &&I have to say that I once dated a Jewish woman whose grandfather worked for Disney as an animator. She told many stories of going to restaurants with those paper tablecloths and him drawing all the famous Disney characters on those; and how the restaurants would keep them or give those to their employees. Her family had many original artworks in their house also.

The grandfather was a part of this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\_blacklist#The\_blacklist\_begins\_(1946&#37;E2&#37;80&#37;931947)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist#The_blacklist_begins_(1946%E2%80%931947))

The controlling, paternalistic nature of Walt Disney as a man is not that well known, and his INCREDIBLE misuse of power while infantilizing his employees like they were his own children was astounding, based on what I learned when I was dating her.

A group of Jewish animators had left Disney as a result of his misuse of power and the controlling way he was generally; and had gone to found an animation studio of their own, when Disney brought them up on charges of Communism. It wasn't REALLY that he had concerns about their Communism or not, it was a business move based on his relationship with political figures and a really good way to eliminate competition.

So, it seems to me that this attitude has never changed in the industry as a whole, given that his experience was from the 1940's and 1950's.

Indeed, it seems we've reverted to this as a society overall, now. Except McCarthy was voted President in this new modern tale from which we have learned nothing, apparently.&&I'm in college for animation right now, and I'd already made up my mind a while ago that I don't want to work in the film industry because of the massive politics surrounding it. It just seems ugly and too much stress. 

Prestigious? Maybe, but it's not worth it unless a position looks really solid. And based off of this, I'm still not sure it's really worth it. &&Sorry for the troubles you guys are facing in your industry. You're up against a lot.&&$170m / 11,000 people = average $15,454 before taxes. But that’ll range a bit based on salary and how long they worked there during that period.&&It really depends on how high up the ladder you are and how long you were with the studio. I was at one of them for a couple years on and off so i'm not expecting much compared to a lead artist who was there the whole time period.&&Tree fiddy&&After law fees (and I find distributed equally) about 13k each. There was $18m fees for lawyers and 11,000 people. But I'm fairly certain not everyone will receive the same, also I'm fairly certain no one will receive more than 50 grand, which is barely a yearly salary which is kind of fucked. 

Again I don't 100% know anything and I'm legally stupid so take what I say with a grain of salt.&&This should've been a bigger story when it broke. Studios were fucking assholes to animators:

> ...animation studios had colluded for years to set salary limits and avoid hiring artists from other studios, thereby circumventing the free market for the skills and talents of their employees.

They deserve more.

&&Very true. As someone who will receive payment as a member of the class for the whole time span, the bosses of my company and others (the creative leaders that everyone loves to praise) conspired to fix wages and had anticompetitive no-hire policies between them. These bastard millionaires stole (potential) earnings from me which impacted my pension and health plan. I am also on disability after decades of overwork and my disability payments are affected as well based on the lower earnings. They conspired for decades to keep wages lower. That will impact my kids their whole lives. And rich people did this. Not rich republicans either, rich Democrats, so fuck them all for being greedy.
  Yes I made money and it was a better job that flipping burgers and wasn’t all bad. However at times when I tried to move companies to get my market’s worth in wages after years of stagnation, the process would sometimes get to a point that all of a sudden would shut down and it was clear some phone call had been made between companies, or at least that was what is conspiracy nuts thought. Well turns out it was a cartel and the conpany heads and HR departments had very explicit and well-proven in court agreements between themselves.
I’m angry rambling now, sorry. But yes, not enough, those guilty made millions and we workers were screwed and it will follow me my whole lives now. $10-20k before taxes doesn’t cut it. &&It won't. It's a paltry sum considering how much money these studios make and how many people qualify for a payment. &&I guess part of the problem is that, well, hasn't it always been this way for animators?&&This. Living it right now and I don't understand how this industry even has a functional business model anymore. Everything is being outsourced due to subsidies and lower wages out of state/country (California/USA). Artists forced to chase after contracted jobs, as staff positions become more rare, and the cost of living is always going up. But movie stars will make $60 million for having their face CGed over a spacesuit in a completely fabricated environment and everyone seems to think that's fine.&&I agree, I know it's not easy to do but it's obviously necessary. Unless they can all just quit and form their own studio or something else like that. I love animation and think the people who really do it deserve fair pay for their highly skilled and lucrative work. &&Many of these people in LA are unionized.  DreamWorks Animation had union workers in Glendale, but the Bay Area Redwood City campus did not.&&They tried.  It collapsed.  Many suspect it was intended to fail.  IATSE is still around, and workers keep trying.&&There's lots of strong unions in the entertainment industry, which has been effective. So, they could get help in starting one or joining one. Unless there already are a union for them that is.&&Actually the DW employees from Glendale were unionized.&&There are so many Chinese studios that unfortunately  will deal with the abuse.&&Your right it's more complicated, but your not wrong. The problem is that there are so many now and alot of new graduates that it will take alot of time to do so and alot of time to fight for it while they don't get paid their shit salary. You need some big players to take a stand. The only reason SAG work really is because when they strike even for a smaller niche like voiceover (I am a voice actor I know it's big but In comparison it's smaller) that means that NO actor will work for those companies so your star power money makers all of a sudden will not work on projects for you even if they are completely unrelated. So honestly the issue is they need a shit ton of truly heavy hitters to step up even though they don't need the pay to fight for their rights.&&I thought that was the point of Pixar and Dreamworks in the first place, to make a proper studio for just VFX animators so that they don't get screwed by the major studios.&&Its not borderline, its actual abuse&&You don't have to pay out 170 million dollars for *borderline* abuse&&In 5 easy installments of $1.99 per year.&&[deleted]&&I saw there was a refridgerator class action lawsuit so I looked on Craigslist and sure enough, someone was selling a broken one for $50.

I told the guy I wanted it for parts for mine because they are shitty fridges and bought it but I just wanted the serial number from the unit to sign up for the class action lawsuit that no one even knew existed.

I thought I was going to get $150 for the lawsuit but ended up getting $1,000.

I didn't feel bad about buying it and not telling the guy about the lawsuit because he wasn't signing up for unless I would have told him about it which I wasn't going to do.&&That would mean 5% of the US work in the animation industry.&&I'm an animation student and I don't really want to he an animator after hearing about shit like this. What did you start working as instead?&&I left the industry after 5 because I realized I would only get angrier and angrier until I realized I was 50 and had been angry my whole life. The ego in this industry is enough to piss anyone off, add the immaturity and the fact I was NEVER paid OT at any studio I’ve worked on (for clients like Disney, Mattel and Netflix) and the no-union, no-rights, no-questions-asked-nonsense and it was enough for me to say fuck it. Doing 15 hour shifts just to say I animated on The Last Jedi is not worth it (I didn’t, just saying that’s considered a really high career goal) &&100%, and that fucking pains me to say. Ed Catmull is a goddamn LEGEND in computer graphics circles.

And now he's a legendary piece of shit that fucked thousands of people out of millions of dollars of money.

Fuck Ed Catmull.&&> Then again Disney may be threatening to blacklist people.

Disney's greatest trick has been convincing the public that they give a shit about anything other than profits for their investors. It's the biggest scam in entertainment. &&And then the work will just go elsewhere.&&I'm getting some Miyazaki flashbacks out of this one.&&I read up on this.  Ed's justification is this:

Keeping American animators' wages low is going to help them remain competitive in the marketplace and will prevent all the jobs from being outsourced to foreign countries.  

Therefore, our scheme to control wages (illegally), is in fact, doing a solid favor to American animation artists by helping them keep their jobs by keeping them earning as little as possible.

End of analysis.

This is pretty clear in what he said about it.  For some reason he made public statements about it, admitted to it, bragged about it.  There was poor concealment on his part.  

In my view, that kind of logic is morally despicable and evil. It undermines the worker's right to choose to be mobile.  It uses an amount of disproportionate power through illegal means to suppress talented people's wages from achieving the market value that a natural marketplace would permit under legal, fair conditions.

TL,dr: Ed Catmull is a complete prick.&&Because all ""good capitalists"" are liars.&&21st ce fox you can't really consider Disney here. Same with Lucasfilm, since it is mainly pre-buyout. And a bit of Pixar too.&&> They certainly didn't steal all that money in little increments

They did, given that this suit covers the period from 2004-2010.

> That might help stem the monopolizing of IP 

The purpose of the lawsuit's resolution is to provide compensation to those negatively affected, not pursue *your* societal goals.

>and numerous other similar forms of pay rigging.

Considering they just had a lawsuit about this, I'd have to say you don't have a leg to stand on.&&Mouse nothing,  I smell a Rat! &&Long-time coming. I remember *Sausage Party* animators suing the studio a while back.

Glad for them to finally get what they deserve.&&this wasn't an overtime issue.  Disney and Dreamworks were full union shops.  Overtime is paid in those studios.  This was a wage theft/ wage suppression/ antitrust violation issue.&&Done&&Thankfully, the Weta Digital guys and gals actually get paid well and respected.&&> Someone should start a new animation company from the ground up.

The problem is distribution. All the big studios also own the tv networks so they get to dictate what gets advertised. Small studios couldn't to advertise like the big guys anyways so it's really hard for small developers to get their name out there unless they 'sell their soul' and partner up with the big guys.&&There's a second payment coming. That was the first half&&Not specifically the fx industry but companies that don't pay a living wage technically are often stealing in a roundabout way.

Lots of working class people are subsidized via government programs because their jobs don't pay enough. Taxpayers have to pay that bill because the companies are being stingy. They're basically stealing with extra steps.&&It’s so commonplace for places that don’t pay overtime to “expect” employees to work more than they are getting paid for, but they expect things to get done and if that requires working overtime, oh well. 

What’s even more ridiculous about this, is if you steal from your employer, they don’t just let you keep your job and pay some of the money back. No they try to fuck you as hard as possible. It’s because laws aren’t meant to protect people. They are meant to protect those who have from those that don’t have. Every once in a while, those that have pay for their crimes against those that don’t, but the penalty is usually a fraction of what it should be after they throw a ton of money at making the problem go away.  

Imagine I worked as some low level employee at Walmart or McDonalds. There a glitch in the system and I’m getting paid 10 times what I should be paid. Instead of 10 dollars an hour I’m making 100 bucks an hour for a decade.  That’s 2 million bucks. If they find out, they will do everything in their power to get all of that extra money back and they would probably win. Now, what if I was getting paid that much because I created the glitch? I cheated the system. Does anyone think they’d let me get away with it by just paying them like 100k back and I get to keep my job? Lol. I’d be in jail and they would get all of my money and then some. 

Corporations get away with so much because while they act as people trying to do whatever they can to get rich (something corporate America loves), they aren’t people and no one has to take responsibility. They might change some upper level people like the CEO, but the company keeps going. Disney doesn’t go to jail. The only way individuals get in real trouble is if they fuck over and steal from other rich people.  Taking from those that have. I don’t even know what can be done at this point. Corporations own everything essentially including most of the politicians that could do anything about the problem. 

These people are the top that fuck over the people at the bottom are the worst kinds of “thugs” in America and nothing is being done about it. Instead some kid selling a bit of weed to get by is getting the book thrown at him so some similar bs. &&Yeah, nah, we’re gonna focus on stopping guys selling loose cigarettes&&It happens basically everywhere, but yes there was a suit with Apple, Google and I think Microsoft?&&yes and in fact, this was an offshoot of the tech lawsuit. 
The judge recognized this and that is why she reduced the lawyer fees from the $38M demanded to $18M - because all the groundwork was already laid down by that earlier lawsuit.&&no, the lawyers get 18M.&&You don't need stars, you need to vote with your wallets.

Boycott movies with unfair labour practices and you'll see a quick market correction.&&Good luck, but it’s not as bad as this thread would imply. If you’re good at what you do, don’t worry.

So you have to always prepare for the eventual layoff &&[deleted]&&Creative teams are great but corporate seems like a bunch of greedy assholes. &&People have been waiting for this for years. It hasn't happened yet and I don't think it will.&&Disney is just a popular name that owns very popular properties.

(This incident was massive)The studio came close enough to bankruptcy after the Oscars they did in fact have to let go of most of their employees, and relocate the studio to extensions in Vancouver and India. Families uprooted to move for work, etc. Sausage party was also a giant issue with people not getting wages etc , as was the new Ghostbusters I believe.  Even after this settlement, it's probably going to be a continuous issue, is why I left the work I loved for production work instead.

Edit: for those who don't know, this was THE best VFX house in the world, no dispute, largest client base etc at the time. They worked on most of the movies for the Oscars candidates that year.

Not saying his cause isn’t just, but head deserved the jaws theme to wraps it up b.&&It seems like they started playing the music as the guys was giving thanks, and before he brought up the struggling studio.

I would totally believe that was intentional, but is it certain that they weren't enforcing a strong time limit at that point? Perhaps he had been talking for too long already?

Edit: Guys I looked up a video to check. [The speech starts at about 1:53](https://youtu.be/OH5Pc8Gd1lo?t=1m53s) and I can hear the Jaws theme start at about 2:38. He doesn't bring up Rhythm and Hues until 10 seconds later. Given the fact that the pre-award dialogue references the disrespect towards VFX artists it seems idiotic to go and cut them off, but there's reasonable doubt as to why they were interrupted.&&Did anyone watch the video...? The jaws theme starts before he even starts talking about the studio so let's use our intuition here before grabbing our pitchforks. A constant Oscars theme is people taking too long on acceptance speeches. In fact they gave away a jet ski iirc last time to the shortest speaker.. so the logical guess is that the jaws theme was started after someone had talked for over the allotted amount of time. The sound crew weren't psychic and wanted to get him off the stage before he even started talking about studio hardships...&&They played the Jaws theme for everyone whose speech went over 45 seconds that year. &&I can sympathize with worker exploitation. But not company. If the companies are being undercut by competition to the point of bankruptcy then they need to start merging together. &&If you even watched the fucking link you posted, they started the music way before he even mentioned financial difficulties. The music started because he was already taking way too long. I don't agree with the music choice, however.&&I'm more struck that the intro happened with the cast of **The Avengers** one of the biggest, most effects driven franchises out there and Sam Jackson's bit, whether scripted or not, shutting down RDJ's attempt at shining some more light on the VFX artists who deserve a big piece of the Disney pie they make happen.&&They did start the theme long before he talked about the industry though. He was still on the usual family part&&I watched the clip and the music started way before he was being ushered off stage. Am I missing something?&&But the music started way before he mentioned anything, except the fact that he didn't have to film on the ocean. Hmm, what does that bring to mind? And who might be in attendance that night, and get a kick out out of it?&&What? They started playing the Jaws music when he was thanking his family, it was obviously just a time issue&&They clearly started the music before he got to the industry politics. Don't name everyone you know in your acceptable speech if you want to use the platform to get a message out, that's really on him more than the program director.&&The Jaws theme was because they were playing music from past winners, they interrupted everyone that was running long with their speeches as a wrap it up signal. 

Not that what happened to the company wasn't bullshit &&Tonne fair, the Jaws theme was the standard cue to hurry it up for that show&&Didn't they start playing him off before he mentioned Rhythm and Hues?

Jesus, look at all the people who upvoted this comment and couldn't have watched, let alone paid attention to this clip.&&Thanks for bringing my attention to this.&&lawyers for the class action are probably taking a third to half of the total payout. and i'm sure there's other fees/taxes/cuts before they payout to the victims. i'd be surprised if they get 5k each. &&That's why these companies roll with these types of punches. Easier to pay a hundred million once to a hundred thousand people than actually pay a hundred thousand people what they are really worth.&&Let's not forget that this is a class action lawsuit. Meaning the lawyers who brought this to court will take home the lion's share of this distribution, while those actually affected will receive a pittance.

$170 Million is absolutely nothing. The lawyers will take home millions upon millions of dollars, and each person actually affected by this *might* get a couple thousand bucks. It's a joke. &&Some of those people in the 10,000 person pool have probably died waiting for the settlement. &&That's $2800/year/person. Somehow I bet they did far far more work than that. That's before accounting for legal fees and other deductions from the settlement. &&lengthy credit scrolls *and* not all the names make it to the list.  The movie studios can limit how many names a company is allowed to have or how many lines they can take up. That's why the larger vfx houses like ILM or DD will pack in all the names together. &&I used to want to work in vfx. I read a few years ago about how bad it is to work in that industry. You’re expected to work weekends, through the night and during holidays. You don’t get paid for any overtime from what I’ve read. 

I decided to switch over to freelance illustration and graphic/ web design. &&There’s a damn good reason that in the entertainment industry, Disney is referred to as “The Rat”&&You're realizing what a ton of high school kids realize when they find out that no, making video games is a terrible idea.

I'm lucky in that I was only 16 when I found out how bad it would be; I'm grateful I have a family friend who works in the industry.&&I'm in my last year of University in the UK and looking to go into VFX as well, does anyone know if it's as bad here as in the US? I've heard of the problems in the US for a while so am debating going into a different, more wage-secure career.&&Disney is bad for artists and animators in more ways than this. It’s more than just corporate- it’s basically run by committee. There’s practically no artistry left. 

*Frozen,* for example, was written by a team of a dozen people and directed by Chris Buck, but at the last moment they slapped Jennifer Lee’s name as “writer” and “co-director” and was promptly promoted to “Chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios” for a success that wasn’t hers and literally no education (and very little experience) in the field. 

Why? Disney wanted to market the fact that she was a female director of an animated feature film. It’s unfortunate that they didn’t trust any of their many talented women in their studio to actually direct - they had a man do it and let this rando take the credit. 

I’ve had the displeasure of meeting her. She’s grossly ignorant of the field yet is incredibly loud and obnoxious. &&I worked at Disney and loved it; although, I wasn't an artist.  Most of the artists I knew seemed to like it or really like it.  It probably depends on what department you're in and who you're working with, but I found it to be a wonderful company and wonderful experience.&&Keep in mind that shows get sequences outsourced to other companies so some rules get pushed out. The place I work at does some disney shows and when I worked on some sequences (vfx) for 4months it was 6 days a week working 11hr days on average, your paid 5 days and 9 hours per day.&&I work in a company that has a software engineering department and a 3D animation and modelling department. The software engineers get way better salaries and perks than the animators due to the market demand for their jobs.&&You haven't been paying attention then man. This shit has been going on for years and is not hidden at all. 

 You should have done more research before delving into it. THAT BEING SAID you can always do advertising etc. It's not as illustrious as movies but that's the point. The job security is better and there are some bits of crutch time but not anything insane as jobs are shorter. &&all you rightfully disgruntled vfx animators should start an ama and give these people some bad press &&Love to hear em. I was there for a few decades too. &&It's kind of a double whammy to Disney/Pixar when you consider John Lasseter was a sexual harassing asshole during the time Catmull was crushing artists' wages and careers.&&I lived through it.  Look it up. 
Look up Oriental Dreamworks. 
Look up Comcast DWA&&I worked in games and vfx too and we hit an artificial ceiling in feature animation because Ed Catmull wanted to save money and make more profit &&These people have been in suspended animation way too long&&> $10 coupon at AMC Theater.

FTFY&&Some quick math... $170,000,000/11,000 members = $15,454.55 per member.

I'm gonna guess there will be additional legal fees that will lower this figure, but they should get some 5 digit $ amount. I hope.&&My background is pretty typical for being a CG artist who ended up at Dreamworks.  Worked in videogame development for years in the art team doing 3D animation/modeling/generalist stuff, then worked for a few years in digital VFX on motion pictures, tv, ads.

a) working unpaid overtime is an issue - it was expected in vfx.  however, when I transitioned to feature animation, I found that being in a union shop helped because unpaid OT was specifically forbidden.  There was some leeway for both sides as a certain amount of hours of OT were set aside in the contract that the management could pull from and demand, but these were paid.

b.  The salary differentials weren't really that weird because early on, there were few people who had the talent and expertise to perform all the necessary tasks - so the staffing was straightforward and the pay was pretty decent.  It's only when two things happened that pay levels became wildly variable:  First, art schools started graduating hundreds of CG artists in the mid 2000s.  This created a huge glut of ""ok"" artists that could be picked up for about 30-40% the pay we were getting.  Second, execs started looking to places like India then China to set up satellite studios where relatively well trained but inexperienced artists could perform some of the production work for 20% of the cost or less of an American artist.

From then on, employers zeroed in on reducing wages as a goal.  This was triggered (in my analysis) by a couple of factors:
- DVD sales stopped.  That was a major source of money that evaporated due to technological evolution toward streaming (whose monetization was not as lucrative)
- Box office revenues were dropping

so they looked to cut costs.

Unfortunately I think that was the wrong place to cut.  It was like cutting muscle, not fat.  They got rid of talented people who really contributed to the quality of the product.  

c) well, that's more of a philosophical debate and VFX has a place in movies but as I've said in some other posts, this lawsuit and this case does not deal with VFX.  It's a feature animation industry issue.&&>Movies are fucked. We dont need VFX. Movies have existed for decades without any overt VFX and hold up significantly better. This public need for VFX blockbusters is absurd - every month a new superhero movie comes out with some garrish action scene that you forget in a second, that probably involved a thousand peoples full year work and 20 million dollars. I don't need a closeup on that tigers whiskers that takes a month to do. I don't need ten thousand background characters all photoreal.

Bit of a missing the big picture effect here. Studios wouldn't keep doing this if it didn't keep drawing in the biggest profit. At the level where VFX tends to exist in the form you dislike, it's a key block in making those 500+million dollar blockbusters. As long as most of us keep watching MCU films and studios like Laika or Pixar stay around, we'll keep seeing VFX work everywhere.

It's not absurd at all, it's just movies caught up with technology and are now moving forward. The sheer overload of movies using it is like the brief ""3D everything"" craze of a few years ago - it'll take time to adapt and level out. There are already well known modern day action flicks that haven't relied heavily on VFX for anything...or if they have, it's been for that detail work to add to a scene. Because we now have the option to add that detail in, when a few decades ago it just wasn't  as feasible to tweak a shot to be closer to exactly how you want it.&&[deleted]&&>a) In my experience top artists can often be an issue. They work late hours with no pushback and enforce that as a rule to others, particularly juniors, until its essentially just an obligation and goes without saying.

I'm in a completely different industry, mechanical engineering, but I can speak to this point.

I did a couple of internships and while I was hourly, my bosses were salary. Every engineering job I ever looked at, applied for, or heard of, was salary.

Imagine my surprise when, after a couple months of job hunting after I graduated, I was hired on the spot with the engineering manager saying ""we'll hire you on as a mechanical engineer 2 at your last pay rate of $20 an hour."" 

A) hiring/being hired on the spot just out of college is a double edged sword, depending on which side of the table you're at. I was NOT prepared for this!! Career services at my college never brought up such a situation, and I was put on my heels very quickly. Do I haggle b/c I should be worth half again as much than what I pulled down as an intern 2 years ago? Do I ask if I can get back to them? B/c I had another VERY promising interview lined up on Monday, whereas I could be starting THIS job on Monday. I needed the job b/c I needed the money, so I took it. (TBH, it WAS a pretty nice gig too!) I'll NEVER be unprepared for an on the spot offer again, though. Hopefully this can help any fresh grads & other junior folks out there.

B) hourly, WTF!?!!??? Job titles Eng 1 - Eng 4 were all hourly, with the next jump to Eng Manger being a jump to salary as well. After a couple months I found my boss was pretty cool (he took me wakeboarding and whatnot, trusted me with his new boat, etc & also giving me the lay of the land for success in my job), so I asked him point blank, what's up with the hourly? Turns out the company was recently raked over the coals in a labor lawsuit for ""expecting salaried employee to consistently put in overtime."" Basically, while salaried employees can are exempt from the overtime rules that hourly employees work under such as time and a half and whatnot, it doesn't mean that they can be worked death. Salaried positions SHOULD work out to roughly ""full time hours"" as an average. &&In general most of the time a massive company says ""we can't pay one group of laborers good wages if another group of laborers gets fair wages"" it is bullshit. You'll see share holders and executives walking away with record profit and minimal increases for actual workers. Disneys stock for instance has increased by six times what it was ten years ago but wages haven't remotely matched that. Some companies like Caterpillar are especially egregious using pay freezes year after year to create record high profits. &&As an avid blockbuster movie goer this makes me sad. Is there anything the general public can do to help? &&So , according to your math, being paid “an extraordinary amount” is equal to only double minimum wage? Sounds pretty okay, a decent way to make a living and be comfortable, but I wouldn’t call that extraordinary. Especially for the hours you mentioned. 

People may say “oh they’re just drawing so that’s incredible, and yeah sure they’re not hauling bricks, but animation is SUPER labor intensive and by no means a walk in the park (telling this to others reason, not preaching to you, OP)

Not calling bullshit at all, just wondering if this was, in fact, accurate.&&>c)

lmao&&> Its a cultural thing where everyone wants to look most dedicated.

This is single handedly ruining the industry. Which is why I make a point to do as little OT a possible unless it's **absolutely** needed.&&I totally understand what you're saying.  We just need accountability and the law on our side.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  &&Ed is a legend in CG as far as his technical contributions. His name is used to refer to rendering techniques and shader properties.  

That being said, his ethical and moral compass in terms of how he regards the people who work for him and the lives of artists in general - is terrible. Just completely reprehensible. We’re talking about a whole generation of American animation workers suppressed like early industrial revolution bosses.  

I’m very disappointed. He harmed us.  My children and the families of 10,000 artists have less to show for our lifelong effort because of his choice to break the law and keep us from getting jobs and raises according to natural market value.  

I think that was a kind of evil that is too often minimized. This settlement allows him to say he did nothing wrong.  And that’s fucking infuriating.  &&Pretty sure there’s all manner of malfeasance in all industries &&You forgot that $18 million of that is going to attorney fees&&Well I hope 6 figures for you at least. Thanks for what you do! &&I gave him a dollar &&As an animator myself...I agree haha.

EVERYONE gets ten dollars! &&Yeah but it's gotten a lot worse the last 20ish years. Partly because of how global production has become and partly because other industries are driving the cost of living up in locations that studios tend to be. It used to be you could make a living but expect to jump around from studio to studio but since they were all close that wasn't difficult. These days you're looking to jump between LA, Vancouver, and Montreal every few months if your not able to float for a few months between jobs.&&The major problem is this particular work is easy to outsource, which causes the studios to go for lower and lower prices.&&Isn't that basically how Pixar got started?&&The problem isn't the studiio you work at, but it's the other studios that will underbid you to get the job. The only way this will change is if we all organise and don't fuck each other over &&It only works if directors and actors join in.  Otherwise they will attempt to outsource it all.  I could see them reducing vfx shots too and trying to go as long as possible before giving in.&&The issue is that many artists and animators tried to join unions but have been blacklisted from working in the industry again. Yes, it takes sacrifices to get such things rolling, but many have opted to just keep their current jobs rather than risk them.&&Probably still happening, too. $170M is a drop in the bucket.&&Divide 170 million by the number of animators affected by this and factor in the long, grueling hours that many animators do to meet strict deadlines.

We sorely need skilled artists who can work under tightish (much looser that vfx) deadlines. Plus it's usually got a good work life balance.&&You should find something else to do then.

At the very least ask yourself 2 honest questions:

1. Am I REALLY good at this? (No really, is it? Don't bullshit yourself, ask a friend to be brutally honest with you, do you have it or not?)
2. Do I REALLY love it? (Also, no bullshit, would you give up benefits and a reasonable work/life balance for it? Do you go home and animated just for fun after animating all day?)

If you're even a little bit on the fence about your answer to either, fucking bail on that plan ASAP.

Think about what other interests you have and change majors. You have plenty of time to figure it out. I was 44 when I switched careers, so if I can do it at that age, no  one has any excuse, especially if you have no real responsibilities yet to a family or marriage yet. 

I enrolled in a boot camp course for something I've always been interested in, but is totally unrelated to my VFX skill set: User Experience Design.

It took me a REALLY long time to figure out what else I could do other than VFX, years in fact. The truth is, I'm good at this kind of problem solving and process so it works for me. It's not something you could say ""Well, I'm a good animator and modeler so I'll be really good at UX design"" situation.

Unity coders are really hot right now. If you can code well in C# there are lots of opportunities in that space and not all of them are games. There's going to be tons of work in VR AR for training and education as well as entertainment and games.

If I were in my 20s, I'd also take a look at trades too. Welders, for example, can make a really good living. It's not easy work but having done a little in the past, I think it's fun and creative in it's own way. I know guys making 6 figures because they're good at it and they got a bunch of certifications for special metals etc... The added bonus is, it's hard to outsource it and that work is done just about everywhere. Look at it this way: There's always something being built.

>Keeping American animators' wages low is going to help them remain competitive in the marketplace and will prevent all the jobs from being outsourced to foreign countries.


[In your other comment you said:](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8uo0rr/animation_workers_set_to_receive_170_million/e1h80v4/)

> Today Dreamworks sold out to Comcast and they laid off most of its USA artists in favor of offshored labor in China and India.

So naively I ask, isn't that just proving the point Ed made?

Edit: just to be clear, I'm not saying that this is right.. Just that if that's one of his justifications, your comment validated his point.&&They all worked with disney a massive amount and disney now owns them. They(disney) were more than capable of pushing certain policies that they(not disney except fox) would have had to follow if they wanted to exist anymore in the entertainment industry.&& I don’t know the ins and outs of these things so I could be wrong but is that still true these days?

So much lost history and families uprooted by that.&&um, best vfx in the world? weta? ilm?  &&I'm an editor and doing the same thing.  production people actually get paid right.&&[deleted]&&What's gross is how many people don't see they started playing the music way before he mentioned Rhythm and Hues.

I am on the side of the VFX industry, but people are doing their best to re-interpret this moment and it drives me crazy. Also, this jaws theme was meant to be a half-joking response to the frequent complaint that the Oscars go on too long. Finally, the nominees were told that there would be a strictly enforced time limit beforehand.

And actually I do understand why the studios do so. Not every individual in catering is going to have their name on there either.  It just pisses me off that people complain about it at all. That they just want it to be producer, director, actors, and maybe whoever did the music if they're feeling generous.  Like the other folk who worked on the movie - basically everyone who doesn't become a household name or appear on the cover of celeb rags - don't matter.  As if they're working overtime, often away from family, for far too little pay, for shits and giggles.  That their names adding to the credit scroll is a massive inconvenience.  Seriously, Duck those people.

One major potential for VFX (but also practical, Foley, etc.) recognition was in bonus features. Seeing exactly how much work might have gone into a single shot that likely went unnoticed, with interviews with the actual artists.  But streaming all but killed that, studios don't go through the bother, and unless you read an industry mag/site, at best people stumble upon one of those ""you won't believe what as t these 10 movies looked like before VFX"" videos that are stills and shitty clips from studio and artist demo reels set to generic background music with lazy text overlaid.

Makes me a mixture of angry an sad.  I best leave this thread, lol :/

&&And were drawing names from a hat for some departments (Production Engineering) at ILM when I was there. I was principle support for a few films and never got the credit. &&VFX is a very different beast.  I would almost go as far as to say that this case which affects feature animation workers should not be viewed as belonging in the same industry as VFX.

Most of us came from VFX or jump in and out of VFX, but feature animation is fundamentally different from VFX.  

Mainly, VFX rarely ever owns their own intellectual property.  They are a service business that furnishes a product for the movie being made.  VFX studios get paid to work on 10, 20, 100 shots that need to be delivered to some studio.

Feature animation on the other hand is owned fully by the studio that produces the product.   Dreamworks owns Kung fu Panda fully.  Disney owns Frozen fully.   

We still produce shots and sequences and many of the toolsets and disciplines are identical as VFX, but it is a different business.

&&I have a degree in animation but I'm currently a computing teacher. If I take either career route I'm destined to work weekends and holidays unpaid... &&That can be true, not always, one show I worked 6 days a week for 3 months with an hour or 2 extra each day for no pay. If you work a weekend you get it as an extra day off, just make sure you book them off as some places can give short contracts and not allow you to take the extra time off (this has not happened to me so far). The longest hours I worked was making commercials, short deadlines and sometimes your on your own, they did pay for food and a taxi if you stayed later than 11pm&&Welcome to the entire TV and film industry, lol. That's the way making movies works. &&>I decided to switch over to freelance illustration and graphic/ web design.

lol!&&Sounds like what is expected of any artistic industry haha. Work all night, work on holiday, work on vacation, work on time off to stay sharp between jobs, work work work work work, and the mofos pay god dam nufin. ""Exposure"" is fucking shit too, worse than an unpaid internship.&&I'm a prop maker - it's pretty similar. Its not in your contract to work overtime and weekends, but if you're on a project that is running over, and it needs to be completed for a shoot, you **will** be shunned for not doing that extra time to get it in. Usually it's paid though, and in a lot of people's eyes, it's acceptable. After all, if you haven't finished your job and the shot will be delayed if it's not on set in time, that reflects crazy badly on you.

However SO MANY companies take advantage of this mantra, to the point where it's common for HoDs to provide crazy timescales for jobs because they know the modeler who gets assigned it will do those extra hours for free even if their overtime isn't cleared, just so the job gets finished on time.

There's a movement called Eyes Half Shut currently happening to highlight the long hours and overtime culture cimmon in the film industry in the UK. Awareness is rising, but I can't see it being a problem that is going to be fixed anytime soon.&&I used to do motion work and now more editing.  Alot of the craziness depends how on where you're located I've done the la/NY scene.  Now in SF.   Normal hours up here.  La was crazy, 10-12 hour days were the norm.  In la you hardly got lunch provided, up here it's common.  One of the worst places I worked at was a commercial prod company that specialized in 3d animation.  They would call you at all hours of the day or weekend.  They would expect you to stay until they need you , often from 9-2am.  Thankfully I was only their for two months.  It's a tough industry.  I want to leave, but I don't know what other roles to get into.  Thankfully, freelance pays pretty well&&Animation and vfx artist here. I’m also a member in this lawsuit. It all depends which studio you work for, but you’re generally not expected to work weekends except maybe in the last few weeks before delivery. At the animation studio I used to work at which is named in this lawsuit, hours were typically limited to 40 hours per week. At the vfx studio I work at now, most recently on Infinity War, I usually don’t work over 50 hours although I got up to 70 in the last few weeks of that show. Almost all studios pay artists overtime, the notable exception being studios in London. At the animation studio I worked at all employees also got a share of the net profits. On a few movies our bonus was half a years salary.

Maybe I’ve just been lucky, but if you pick the right place to work animation isn’t a bad job.&&Mouschwitz&&We just call it 'working for the Mouse'.

I do believe in the horrors of the industry, but I think it's dependent on who you work with.&&Making games is not a terrible idea. Neither is being an animator. Pick where and how you work carefully, and work with others to weed out terrible practices like this. If it's not for you that's cool, but they're incredible industries&&The attitude in the games industry that ""you should be happy just be able to work here"" is the worse. They are really bad at compesating you for your time, because it's ""fun"", and you enjoy what you are doing.

Sadly, with VFX it's a race to the bottom: Live by the subsidy, die by the subsidy.  I'm a crusty old VFX guy from the 90s-00s, so the shift in the industry was bad for me and my personal interests.  However, if I was young and just getting into the industry, I might really enjoy the nomadic lifestyle abroad .  But eventually you will place down roots and not want to move every six month, want some stability and maybe even a family.  That's when you need to realize modern VFX is a temporary career field for most people.  Like a pro athlete, just recognize that you have a shorter career timeframe than most other industries.  Thankfully, I think you'll find VFX can provide you an immense, diverse skill set that can be useful in other fields.  Have a backup plan for when things become intolerable or life throws you for a loop.&&It's as bad as you let it get. This industry is full of complainers and guys with no balls who can't say no to weekend requests. I worked 3 years in London after graduation university and have done no more than a couple a couple weekends of OT work. If you get your work done, you don't have to come in at the weekend, who knew!&&I'm from germany and am planning to start studying vfx next year. Stories like this scare the hell out of me though.&&Yes it is. There is a lot of work, but expect insane overtime hours, unpaid. &&Wow, that's fucking surprising. Out of interest, are there any more stories like this you've heard? &&Same thing happens with accounting and junior managers (which is what I'm studying). A friend of mine is 34, has been managing production and accounting on this company for almost 10 years since he got off college, still loses his parking spot for every new software guy fresh out of college the company gets. He gets little above min wage and now has to walk 10 minutes to get to the factory. The production workers themselves have it worse.

This is why I'm glad VFX also includes a bit of programming, namely Python. And if you get into videogames you are dipping into C, C++, C#, and Java (assuming you aren't working at a big studio with a very specific job on the pipeline which is the vibe I'm getting from the thread). That makes you a bit more valuable, and at the very least gives you a backup plan: you can always go back to college and study CS and be a bit ahead with this background.

So my advice here would be: if you get into VFX, definitely go the extra mile to program your own tools into Maya, Blender, or whatever software, and learn you way around Unity or Unreal or Android development. You lose nothing. You can also get your hands on Houdini which is hands down the best VFX software out there for free if you use their student version, and you can learn how to use Python while procedurally generating assets. So it's a fun way to learn programming and developing that plan B. It's a bigger hassle though because you need to go back to linear algebra and trig&&Oh no don't get me wrong, I still think knowing how to work 3D, modeling, texturing, animation, and a bit of VFX, is useful as heck. Say tomorrow you want to create a kickstarter or you want to make a presentation to someone important and you need to show them any kind of concept, you're going to need 3D. Or if like me you suck at drawing, you can easily use 3D and then turn it into a 2D picture and use Photoshop to make it look like a drawing and use it for all kind of illustration purposes (book cover, websites, apps, etc.). 

Also like I've said on another comment, there are fields inside 3D, like the game industry, where you are forced to branch out and learn programming, and  not just one language either, but 4-5, so you aren't exactly restricted. But of course this applies only if you are working for a small Indie studio where you have to do a bunch of stuff, whereas people in the VFX area are usually in a big studio tied down to a very specific role within a much bigger pipeline.

What is sad is having these people, who specialized on a topic, who became masters of their specific role within the bigger machine, not getting properly rewarded. That means that working for a big studio is unrealistic and most likely unwanted, because as these stories show you are easily replaceable, and you are better off working for smaller studios.

That said, I don't regret learning about 3D and VFX at all and I'm going to keep at it.&&After reading [The Men Who Would Be King](https://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Would-King-DreamWorks/dp/0547520271), I'm not surprised.

So many people jumped on the Dreamworks bandwagon on really low salaries, with the promise of bonuses, raises and pots of gold at the end of the rainbow. All the while told that if they put their nose to the grind, the company would reward them for starting with them at the beginning.

Made billionaires out of Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen, so I guess that's something.&&Constantly pulling tricks to refuse to pay O.T., work 18 hour days and that isn't enough. I had half my editing team out sick for two weeks just as I joined, and I was expected to just jump into it and start pumping episodes out without any kind of introduction to the project or the system. 

Send the same project to someone twice without changing anything and get totally different notes on what has to change. 

Bizarre and contradictory story notes from different executives who clearly just wanted to put their fingerprints on the project and not actually make it better. 

The scheduling and deadlines were insane, and then after HTTYD2 underperformed, and they fired 800+ people, our totally unconnected department had a bunch of staff trimmed and the jobs shipped to Vancouver. 

&&As a 3D artist I admired them both for a long time. I attended a talk Catmull did at SIGGRAPH years ago and his enthusiasm and intellect were inspiring. I always cheered for Lasseter and was delighted when he was named CCO of both Pixar and WDAS after the acquisition. I'm extremely disappointed in both of them and it's really made me think twice about admiring *anyone* you don't truly know.&&Oh my apologies.  I misunderstood.

It's learned. As you move more and more into management you see it pretty quickly. It takes one manager to start bitching about his reports, then it spreads to the weaker managers, and before long they start justifying all kinds of things. More than once I have seen promotions passed over certain folks because they weren't married with kids - because they know you can't leave if you are... 

This industry is fucking cut-throat, to make it work you have to live your life differently, you have to be super frugal and always have a lot of money saved or a backup plan for when people try and pull your card.&&So $13,818 if each person got paid equally&&Lmao &&Is there a race to the bottom with regards to salary? Are there talented animators who will do this work on the cheap?  It seems like this is the type of industry that could easily command a huge salary since pretty much all blockbuster movies have major animation and vfx in them. 

I can’t comprehend how there would be people doing animation for cheap for a company like Disney/marvel? &&No joke. I actually shifted into teaching because of the instability. It's much more stable and pays just as well, if not better.&&Why haven't they done that already then? 
If they could get it done cheaper and the same quality by outsourcing it they already would have.

&&I believe so. But then look where they ended up eventually, and the receiving end of these lawsuits, and losing. So maybe I guess forming their own studio with core values isn't enough and forming an animator's union will work better long-term.&&As I replied to another comment in the same vein

Why haven't they done that already then? If they could get it done cheaper and the same quality by outsourcing it they already would have.

What is currently stopping them outsourcing everything?&&Just over 1/4 of what one movie (Infinity War) made.

In the U.S.
&&I know several.

I've known people that pursued art and animation since they were kids that six months into their first ""big"" project just walked away. When you're basically expected to work 18+ hours a day for weeks or months on end because there's always someone out there willing to work longer for cheaper... it's hard to care. Plus if you paid attention and learned your scripting the skills translate to other applications.&&no, the attorneys are set to get $18M.  it's in the judge's order.  &&Maybe I just assumed their cut is about 15% (which is [a purported average](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/attorneys-fees-in-class-actions-too-low-too-high-or-just-right/)) and rounded the percentage from 4.5% to 5%?  
  
I mean, I didn't, but I *could've*.&&Shit dude. Disney acquiring every studio and increasing their Monopoly makes me sweat too. I'll probably be paid slave labor if this keeps up. 

Hope you find something better as well!&&Fuck you, got mine.

But let's be clear, he's not on top NOW. Catmull was an early executive at ILM. He's been on top for a loooooong time and likely never really had to be down in the trenches the way current artists are. &&Dude invented *motion blur*. He's an asshole but goddamn... &&I mean, it's either them or Comcast. Disney at least puts out a good product. They're clearly horrifically evil and, frankly, it's getting to dystopian levels by now, but they make a good product.&&News Corp is legally unafilliated with 21st Century Fox. They just both happen to be managed by Rupert Ballsack.&&> the last thing the industry needs is Disney being even more powerful.

Yeah but it's not like they aren't going to be.&&Yes Mr. Mouse...&&the Maushwitz guards&&Makes no sense to me that people worships big corperations.

Do they hope someone at Disney will notice them and reward them for the ""love and loyality"" they give?&&I don't really see the studios in China, India, UK or Singapour going on strike for US workers. Hell, I don't think that our studios would and I live in France which is basically strike country.&&Actually no - on the contrary, the suppression of American wages helped save a good amount of money yet it did not stem the offshoring of these jobs.  The only way the management (I'm solely talking about Dreamworks here, not Disney or Pixar) would have NOT gone with offshore studios would be if our wages were reduced to equal that of the Chinese wages or Indian wages.  As long as we were even slightly more expensive, they would have laid us off like they did.  

They just happened to have saved some money prior to laying us off.

Ed Catmull's argument doesn't hold water for two reasons.  The first one, I just presented.  The second one:  Look at the enormous profits made by Pixar and Dreamworks and Blue Sky.  Frozen, Coco, Kung Fu Panda, Shrek, Madagascar, Ice AGe.  These movies made well above their production costs.  The actual cost of animators that worked on these movies is a tiny fraction of the cost.

The voice actors alone in the movies I worked on brought in several million dollars each.  The marketing costs of a movie was around $80M.   When you look at the cost structure of a movie, the cost of animators (and by animators, I mean the entire production crew) is small.  

Ed Catmull's focus on suppressing wages and reducing mobility is in my view more about keeping crews sequestered - more about restricting mobility.   He didn't want people bouncing from studio to studio.  He wanted to keep these teams stable and in one spot for easier management.

When Shrek2 made something like $991M in box office gross and a shit ton more in DVD sales, the focus on trying to reduce the wages of production crews is completely ass backward.

I just came up with a 3rd reason why this scheme was unsound.  It's kind of an obvious one but I have to say it.  It's illegal.  And it's illegal in a way that is also morally wrong.  This ""business decision"" was against the law for a good reason.  It hurts people.  It hurts families.  It robs people of the free opportunity they are promised to get.  Our government has pledged to uphold laws that prevent this sort of abuse from powerful bosses who group together to put pressure on the workers and distort market forces by manipulating the market by their sheer power.

Ed Catmull knew what he was doing.  He is surrounded by an army of execs and lawyers who know the legality of their company's policies.  And so they went forward with it anyway - knowing full well that it was wrong to do.  Someone probably said that the numbers would make it worthwhile even if they got caught.  The savings would outweigh these settlements - I have no doubt they do.

I think that what Ed did is morally reprehensible and I condemn it. &&Again, for the purposes of this lawsuit, you can't randomly decide that Disney had control of someone they didn't. Disney owns them *now*. Not then. &&All the VFX companies were underbidding each other with unrealistic bids. Studios took advantage and exploited it.&&There are two points here.  
One, smaller or independent studios where bidding on work for almost cost or below payments, in order to score a bit movie, so in the hope the score better pay later, which doesn't happen.  
Secondly, studios that went down and a lot of their people were let go, those people found that they could only find work for underpaying jobs in either studios caught in the same loop, or to big studios (disney, pixar etc) that were also heavily underpaying, and once you got a job at lets say pixar, you can't move to disney or sony or any of the other big studios, because they will not hire from each other. And if you leave pixar, some of them will black list you even if you left under good terms.

Back when the LOTR trilogy was still being released my sister used to collect DVDs and we'd watch through the bonus features on almost every one of them.

3 wanted the same asset more yellow because he thought the production designer would want it more yellow.

I show the asset on Monday to 1.  his note is to make it more saturated.

I show the changes on Tuesday to 2.  his note is to make it less saturated.

I make it less saturated and show the changes on Wednesday to 3.  his note is to make it more yellow.

On Thurdsay, 1 sees the changes and asks for more saturation.

Western houses cost more, but thats where the polished finish professional looking work comes out of. &&It wouldn't look good if Pixar was caught bribing a corrupt Chinese official or an African warlord to do business. &&Not when you work as a subsidiary of a mega entertainment corporation&&They have.

For bigger films those VFX houses are commanding pretty heavy contracts still, and the artists don't work for the studios. With Disney and co. it's a little different since they own so much. &&They don't have to do it when everyone is willing to just work for nothing.

You seem confused.

I am not going to deny quality will suffer if they outsource, but they definitely are going to test to see if it has an effect on box office before offering any extra money to anyone.&&Right! 

Im pretty sure somebody bought a thing for like $70 billion  recently. This seems like spit in the face.&&To be fair, 1/4th of a movie like that is a fucking massive chunk, and a lot of that is going towards other people who contributed to the movie too, if they just had that chunk of money go missing it'd be a lot. &&I actually wanted to be an animator myself, but then I saw what the work conditions were.

You don't know much about Ed's personal background I see. Yes, he's been at the top for a long time (and absolutely has earned the fuck yous in this thread due to this wagefixing scandal), but keep in mind, the guy is 73 years old, he didn't just walk into the ILM job, and Pixar wasn't an overnight success story. He absolutely worked his way through the trenches to get to where he is now. Just like most of us, he started with a basic ass job (grocery store bagger) busted his ass through college, and seized every opportunity to network and grow.

Also, he took a shitload of risk in the early days of Pixar. His contributions to the entire computer graphics industry can't be understated. But yeah, fuck wagefixing.&&Frozen was shit&&Studios in China, India, UK, etc would be THRILLED if US workers went on strike.&&

I just say ""manufacturing"" and steer the conversation back to them. &&Means that some VFX companies need to go out of business, practically speaking. Too much competition.&&Wait, how is it the studios' fault for accepting the lowest bid?  That's how the business works. &&I think another issue was no union protection like for other parts of the industry so they were also overworked and as VFX studio were bidding for contracts they needed to survive the movie studios also expected unpaid extra work. When a director changes their opinion on a cut (""it's easy to change with computers"") it was the VFX company that did the work but didn't get compensated for it. 

If I remember correctly the contracts were usually in favour of the movie studio (so they could control cost) and the VFX studios had to work around that (be it redoing completed cuts or crunching to meed deadlines). Movie studios also like to ignore issues and just ""[fix it in post](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixItInPost)"".

And then came the cheaper VFX studios from outside of Hollywood and other outsourcing opportunities that put even more pressure on existing VFX studios to give up power in contract negotiations. &&That's great advice.

I couldn't survive on ""exposure"" as payment and unfortunately a lot of my peers gladly took no pay, which set a bad precedent (also nepotism, but that's another issue). &&And it is funny cause the same ""adults"" will tell you it is part of growing you have to take some bs and build your portfolio before you demand reasonable wage bla blah&&I get a freelance gig from time to time that I can also do from home, but it usually comes with the same issues: demand for too many hours with issues with compensation. Good luck to you, friend!&&Realistically, the pay would need to be significantly more to get me to leave, but it's more than just the job. I'm married and have a son now, and we bought a house last year. We're not terribly close to any of the larger production areas, so an industry position likely means a move. Plus, teaching offers stability that neither games or film really have. Not to mention, where I work has an awesome pension an benefits. I'll still do freelance work and try to get a few projects off the ground, but my foreseeable future seems to be rooted in teaching.&&>bribing a corrupt Chinese official or an African warlord

I don't think the vfx scene is super hopping in wartorn African nations.&&Just the short dalliance I had with contract work was enough to assure me I never wanted to touch the shit again. The absolute worst example was one project where I had a deadline that went from three weeks from the end of this week... to two weeks from today... to the end of next week... in the course of about 30 hours.

Put my head down, ground it out, collected the paycheck, walked away. Never again will I tolerate that level of bullshit because some other fucker wants to make his boss's dick hard. &&Hey folks - I just finished grad school and I helped write a case on this exact subject believe it or not! I worked with a tenure professor and co founder of a VFX house to research the content, it won’t be available publicly  but I would love to chime in. 

Competition is a piece of it, yes, but I would argue government subsidized tax incentives play a bigger role. VFX houses are rather expensive investments as many of you know (servers, computers, office space, and labor...ooooh the labor). Studios can go chasing tax incentives because that’s the fiscally responsible thing to do as someone writing the check; however, VFX houses with these long timeline bids can’t up and move their offices every time a new city increases a rebate. I discovered that in some cases, between Vancouver’s tax subsidy (~25%) and the exchange rate from US to Canada, there were times some studios could get as much as a 47% discount on the same services provided by a US house (like R&H). 

When you look at it from that macro perspective, it doesn’t matter how good your operating model was you could not compete profitably with a studio located in a tax subsidized city. Example: let’s say an LA based VFX shop bids $10M for work on Avengers 21, let’s pretend that price = cost + margin for the VFX house to operate sustainably. Vancouver VFX company bids the same $10M, but the city of Vancouver will give the movie studio $2.5M back as a tax rebate. So for the US VFX house to even have a chance at getting the work, they have to start their bid at $7.5M. Goodbye margin, hello ‘let’s just keep people employed and the lights on’ mentality. 

These tax incentives are meant to encourage development of an industry in a given area, but they are highly inconsistent. The tax plans have a significant amount of variance, and as some states have shown in the past they don’t always last or bring the type of long term industry development hoped for. 

Edit: Massachusetts offers a competitive tax incentive, we see a string of Boston movies (all of Adam Sandler’s grown up series, Ted 1 & Ted 2, the equalizer, black mass, even American hustle which takes place in Ny was shot mostly outside Boston), but the benefits have been widely debated (article from 2014): http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/18/cost-film-tax-credit-per-mass-job/LGHOSjvkPrfwMyK4xYS79N/story.html

Point is without a plan, a timeline to offer, or more strategic regulation, studios just look around frantically for the best price and VFX ends up being treated like a commodity. Cities have the budgets and power to alter the competitive landscape more than studios or VFX companies combined, and for them it can be easily tucked under the “creating more jobs” slogan, but feels more just like relocating the same jobs when your employer says either move to Vancouver with your family or find a new job. 

Edit: removed anecdote, updated for clarity, and typos &&I mean you could have a pact to no go under a certain price. Then they wouldn't have shot themselves in the foot. Thought all the companies would have to agree. They could blue ball the fuck out of movie companies if they did that but they don't &&Sounds a little like my boss..

Construction work, but it's not unusual for him to turn up on site ranting about how he is loosing money and that I need to get the boys working harder..

Its funny for two reasons.

1 is that his definition of ""losing money"" is not making quite the obscene profit he hoped for.

2 is that he has a bad reputation in town for massively undercutting the competition (he uses some questionable tax loopholes to help this along)&&There have been efforts made, but the studios have such an advantage that if anyone tried to unionize, they would just move all production to India and China and say fuck it.&&Basically no unions in VFX&&This is why Vancouver is a place now.&&Good point. I think too many people, especially in this industry, undervalue themselves out of a not completely unfounded fear that a prospective employer will pass. 

As a nobody filmmaker it’s also nearly impossible for me to follow my own advise. I do, however, pay everyone who works on my films out of my own pocket. Having worked a number of indie productions where they paid in experience or lunch, this is one trend I’m doing my small part to buck. &&That makes so much sense. There's crazy stuff happening in fashion and the amount of material knowledge that guy has, plus the way in which fabric can be simulated in 3D space could save so much time drafting. That's a fascinating transition. &&Yeah i'd like to know this as well.&&[deleted]&&Hey but fuck unions amirite? /s&&Maybe he meant the Jews?&&The music started because he was taking too long. They cut the feed because he was talking about RH&&They were just doing a rough calculation.

It's approximately, on average $2,800 per person, per year.

It says nothing as to the individual payout for any individual, but gives an idea of the overall level of payment each person would receive.

Some people might get $5, some might get $15,000, but on average it's about $2,800 each.

They were just putting a number that sounds unimaginably huge ($170Mil all up) into the context that it's actually really quite small (~$2,800 per person, per year)&&It's not a lion's share.  It's $18M out of $175M.  The judge saw that procedurally, this case benefited from the groundwork being laid down by a prior and related class action case - the High Tech Lawsuit - and so reduced the lawyer fees accordingly.  I believe the lawyers had initially demanded close to $39M and the judge computed this new lower figure.&&I think they're claiming that their name showing up 4 minutes into the credits doesn't matter. Not saying I'm agreeing, just saying. &&As someone who formerly used to work at EA, I would say that's the opposite of what I experienced. That being said this was way after the whole EA wives lawsuit.

The pay was a bit worse than other places, but they made up for it in how relaxing and stress free it was. I never felt monitored and the only time I had to do OT was when my team failed to provide a good estimate for when our work needed to be done.

I would definitely work there again if I had to, it's just a lot more difficult to make your way up since there are so many people.&&I actually read EA is pretty hands off.&&Somebody’s box to do it. Once she got started, nobody could container.&&Don’t forget croods 2 back on!&&I have heard some conflicting things about that. Some people say it's great working in a big company and they get paid a lot while others in another big company say exactly what you say.&&Ive never actually won an upwork bid, and figure its basically entirely people willing to work for 5$ an hour - and I'm never going to put a bid in that low. &&Yeah but then the work looks like shit and people won't see your movie and then it bombs&&Actually in some countries they're paid well and it's cheaper. Some countries want the business so their governments subsidize their vfx industries. This does in fact create a race to the bottom because the people getting paid don't have any say in it. Unions have always been in the works but take a guess at who's shooting them down? Sucks to see it's not getting better because animation and vfx are my passion and I just started my career in it :(

Anyhow...

There's a great [freakonomics episode](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/no-hollywood-ending-visual-effects-industry/) that covers this. (I could be thinking of the episode planet money did but that was from 2013 so it's not as up to date.)&&No&&Uhhgg the word *Exposure* should be banned from job sites.&&Yeah they can’t work 16 hours a day on a computer in countries where you don’t even have reliable electricity.&&I actually lucked out with the one freelance job I applied for, I was the sole animator for a series of environmental education videos, forest fires and avalanches and stuff, and for the most part it was okay, I put in 6-8 hours a day alongside my normal day, but that's because I wanted to, the deadlines were pretty generous.

However, there was one scene where I animated some 300 trees getting taken down by the avalanche and, after months of seeing the stills and rough animation drafts, one of the decision makers decide they didn't like the shape of trees, which meant I had to remove them all and make a new tree and animate them all over again. I dunno why it only occurred to them that they didn't like the trees instead of over the period of months. That was a hint of what I think a lot of people experience when they freelance.&&This is brilliant and I'd love to read your full work. I know living in Wilmington NC I've watched as our state subsidy disappeared and a ton of my friends in the film industry chased the jobs to Atlanta. I do wonder if long term we're creating effectively a nomadic workforce as studio's chase tax breaks around. And then I wonder if the transient nature of this workforce will begin to diminish the value of those very subsidies to communities. Any thoughts?&&Ironically enough, I have built a LOT of ""satellite"" facilities over the years for some mid sized VFX houses. Usually at a medium sized place you have enough spare gear around to get a small office off the ground exceedingly cheaply (maybe 100k depending on how you do it).

A lot of the time what happens is they run out and build those facilities and pretend the work was done there (Zoic got caught a few years ago doing this). Every company I have been at though intentionally fudges some amount of those numbers.

The whole system is retarded, chasing these tax cuts has been going on since the early 2000's, and it's still happening today, I just built an Atlanta facility... 

To be fair, it's not solely about the rebates, they are also trying to capture local episodic markets too, but the focus is certainly rebates.&&Yea it's the same for the games industry, Canada has always been one of the best places for tax incentives.  Tiga in the UK has been trying to lobby our government to get similar tax incentives (films get them I believe, but games have to go through a ""cultural importance"" process).

It's a shame that these amazing studios just can't compete with Canada, but realistically if you're getting into the VFX/Games industry, you need to have the mentality that at some point, you WILL be moving to Canada.  Had a lot of mates just move straight to Canada instead of pissing about with US/European companies, knowing it's just the most stable place.&&Nice breakdown! The one point I’d like to make is that in Massachusetts 2017 was the biggest year yet for the film industry here. I could totally be wrong but I think you might be confusing your stats because when spending more than 50% of total budget or filming at least 50% of the principal photography days in Massachusetts makes the project eligible for the production credit and a sales tax exemption. It’s not capped at 50%, it starts at 50%.

&&That's called price fixing and is illegal.&&Yup, that's illegal and with good reasons. &&That's when solidarity comes in. Screen Actors Guild should refuse to work with non-unionized VFX teams.&&That’s what they try to scare the artists with.. in reality, that would not happen - certainly not fast enough to be a big worry.  The reason for studios moving any work in India and China is for the cheap labour, which can only be applied to jobs that are easy to commoditize. 

VFX work is mostly highly skilled specialized problem-solving sort of work... move all the work to these places, and by the time the locals have the experience to do the high-level stuff efficiently, they’ll be demanding higher wages that go with it.

This is why traditional animation always moved their inking and colouring out there (rote crafts that can be systematized easily), but never the key animation. &&yup it sucks. hard for production to justify paying bay area salaries when people in the philippines will animate for 500 bucks US a month&&Well awesome man. That's admirable and I applaud your efforts. I too try to pay the people I work with fairly. Maybe we'll work together one day. Feel free to check out my music on www.soundcloud.com/amalgum

It benefits some of them like Sausage Party where most of the budget probably went to the stacked cast if they worked with a union type animation thing the budget would've been higher and the movie might not have been greenlit with a high budget needed. &&Lol, SAG doesn't give a shit. BCC artists are listed after the caterers on film credits. That shows you right there where they stand in the eyes of the studios.

[SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST TWO MOVIES]



First movie: Hiccup loses a leg

Second movie: Hiccup loses his father

So help me god, if Hiccup loses Toothless in this...&&He got a BEARD?!&&I love that Toothless does the dances that birds of paradise do.&&The Epic Conclusion? So its the last one they are making?

EDIT: Yes, it is the last one, and the TV show ended this year too.&&I won't be surprised if this damn movie makes me cry&&>There were dragons, when I was a boy 

😭😭😭 &&Cool shot of him walking out the fire&&Hide your dragons. Engage your defenses. And get this bud a shield.&&Am 40, and have always adored these movies....more so than my kids.  I'm ready to ugly cry my way through this amazing conclusion to an already wonderful series.  &&I'm happy that at least from this trailer it seems like they're giving Astrid a bigger role again. She was for the most part put on a boat (literally too) after the first 20 minutes in the last movie and it seems like they didn't know what to do with her.

It's also nice to see that Toothless is apparently the Hiccup of his own species.&&Wait is not coming out this year? The trailer said next spring. &&It astounds me that given how Dreamworks recent movies are pretty... eh for the most part, the HTTYD has been the studios trick up its sleeve with astounding visuals and just fantastic in general.
In a way, they almost don't feel 'Dreamworks'.

Can't wait to see it next year!&&The shot of Toothless and Hiccup walking through the fire...

CHILLS.&&This week is clearly a trailer orgy.&&Holy shit the water in the waterfall thing looks good. And I'm not entirely sure how I feel about them using an Ed Sheeran song for a trailer for an epic dragon adventure.

Also, he looks like John Krasinski with that beard. First they Longbottomed him and now they are... Halperting? Krasinskiing? him.&&Yo Toothless just went full Thor mode! 
&&The first two How to Train Your Dragon movies are surprising gems with wonderful characters and themes. It's not often animated sequels can continue the magic, but I'm optimistic about this one. &&Congrats on the Oscar Dreamworks.&&This just makes me nostalgic for the first one.&&Does someone have a dragon mating dance gif yet? I need that in my life.&&ANOTHER TRAILER WITH THAT STUPID FEW SECONDS AT THE START &&I told myself I wouldn't be attracted to Hiccup anymore because I'm 33. I shouldn't crush on animated characters anymore. I'm an adult.

But damnnn that stepping out of the fire moment. 0_0&&The first two are my favourite movies ever. I already know I'm gonna cry like a little bitch in the theatre.&&The Epic Conclusion phrase make me think the ending will be a bittersweet one.&&As someone who thought the trailer for the last HTTYD was waaaaay too spoilery, is this one safe to watch? &&They managed to bring back a great voice cast:

Cate Blanchett

Gerard Butler

Craig Ferguson

America Ferrera

This is going to be great and I'm probably going to cry like a baby&&Bearded Hiccup! Thunderous Night Fury! Looks like Thor has major influence in this one!&&I can't wait. These movies always have top tier animation and score.
Plus I had the idea of the [""Light Fury""](https://imgur.com/gallery/XJulnc4) too ever since I saw the first one. So it's kinda funny to see it be a real thing.&&Anyone else feeling like this whole movie is going to be a flashback, Hiccup telling a story to his kids?

and its his bday! &&Ah, I see they're bringing Jon Snow into this by the look of that beard.&&Something about Jay Baruchel's nerdy forever-teen voice just seems so weird coming out of a bearded Hiccup's now-manly face&&

This movie trilogy broke a lot of grounds for kids films such as having like an openly gay character, actually killing off and keeping dead a main protagonist that’s been with the film since the first one and actually aging the characters and showing how they grow.

This movie looks fantastic, cannot wait for this. Toothless’ little dances at the end were adorable. &&This has Ash saying goodbye to Butterfree levels of sad written all over it&&#LET THE WIND CARRY US TO THE CLOUDS HURRY UP, ALRIGHT!&&Great trailer, but take that Sheeran song and stick it.&&How to Train Your Dragon has one of the most gorgeous soundtracks in recent memory, and they put a pop song in the trailer.

Why.&&Hiccup with a beard = Jake Gyllenhaal &&How to Train Your Dragon: We’re getting toothless laid ya’ll&&Still find the design of the Light Fury lazy, but still very excited for this movie.&&Believe me or not, The first thing I said when getting out of the cinema after seeing the second one, I said ""Toothless's getting a girlfriend in the third one"". It was just so obvious it would happen.&&DreamWorks: A Comcast Company

Another reason this trailer may make you cry&&The music is really majestic. Thanks to John Powell for this amazing soundtrack.&&Anyone else think the song doesn't fit? 

It's weird hearing a recently popular song in a trailer &&You just know the ending will be him letting Toothless go to live with the White Toothless, and we will all collectively bawl our eyes out Toy Story 3 style. &&So... Spoil me.

... Are there still, dragons in hiccups life? &&*There still are. But there were dragons then too.*&&I have so many chills right now. That is an awesome line. &&I got misty eyed immediately, that was a low blow with that scene and that music. This trailer should have a warning label.&&I had no idea it was a book series. 
&&Adding to theories that there are no more dragons, Toothless behind bearded Hiccup is most likely a hallucination or his imagination, since he's entirely grey, even his green eyes are gone.&&They've consistently made Toothless a mix between a cat, dog and a horse in his movements. &&It's how my cat wakes me up. &&Someone rip that scene and post it to /r/catslaps &&""Are you Toothless, Dragon of Hammers?""&&What are the chances that the immigrant song plays during this?&&Are you Toothless, god of teeth?&&Bring me BLÜDVIST!!!&&The weird thing is the series already has a lightning dragon known as the [Skrill](http://howtotrainyourdragon.wikia.com/wiki/Skrill) (mentioned in passing in the first film and featured in the TV/Netflix series) so I wonder what  this new found power is that toothless has, I hope they don't just borrow the stuff from the Skrill.&&""There were dragons when I was a boy."" It's a safe bet Toothless leaves him at the end of the film, whether or not the writers kill him off.&&Toothless either dies or he goes to live with light fury in their world, for fucking sure.  

and I, a 27yo man, will sob like a bitch.&&[Hiccup with a beard that I screenshotted and cropped cause it wasn't in the immediate Google image results.](https://i.imgur.com/im6NYju.jpg)&&I think that's his actual girlfriend. &&I assume that that part of the trailer is future him narrating the trailer, maybe not, but beard hiccup did say that all the dragons disappeared, so I'm pretty sure that's future adult him.

He looks cute though, so it works.&&It's so good to see someone else recognized those wacky ass birds.&&Yep. Dean only agreed to make a second movie if he was allowed to make it into a trilogy, so this should be what the franchise has been leading up to. &&Dean DeBlois (director) always intended it for it to be a trilogy if he came back to make the sequel&&Thanks folks, maybe thats for the better.

Timestamp: https://youtu.be/-zvv76_x5og?t=2169&&I mean the second one made me tear up and if this movie ends like I think it will, there's no doubt I will do it again. &&I got a little emotional during the trailer. &&I am so not fucking ready for that&&I'm not ready for this emotional trainwreck :(

That said, he did mention that ""only a few know"", which could mean that he still visits. &&And I'm crying at the first line of a trailer....

This movie is going to wreck me&&We can hope that his village will protect the dragon sanctuary for the rest of eternity until ragnarok or something. &&Were* please fix&&It's a nice throwback since Astrid did the same in the first movie and that was the epitome of a badass Viking he could never be.

Now look at him!&&I hope he breaks out that gadget shield he had in the TV series again.&&35 year old guy here. Also wept during both of them. Toothless is one of the best original characters of the past decade and these movies stack up against the best that Pixar has had to offer.&&Seriously. A co-worker just walked up behind me and tapped my shoulder said ""I thought you were doing something important""

I just *glared* at him.

***GET OUT***&&I've been waiting for my kids to get old enough to watch. Tried again recently, and they still said ""when I'm older"". Hope it happens before next spring so we can watch the conclusion in theaters.&&I know this movie will wreck me. &&Am I grown man? Absolutely. Will I cry like a fucking baby when this ends? Absolutely. Something about the relationships, especially between Toothless and Hiccup, in these movies is incredibly special.&&Technically Toothless is the everything of his species since he's... ya know... the only one.&&So agree!

 I love the scene that they have together at the beginning of the second film.  It made me SO happy because you can see how well they communicate with and support each other.

It's such a tired trope in films to see the couple get together in the first film only to bicker and argue their way through the second to create artificial drama.

It's just one of many positive writing choices in this series that I absolutely LOVE.

It's also beautiful reflection of the main theme of the series. Just as the Viking and the Dragons are stronger together, so are Hiccup and Astrid.

Excuse me, have to wipe some dust out of my eyes!&&One of my mild pet peeves from the second movie was how Astrid felt like a much better fit as leader of their village. Though it was poetic for Hiccup to step into his father's role. &&Yes, March 1, 2019.&&March 2019 was already confirmed&&Kung Fu Panda is almost up there for me too. Those two franchises are Dreamworks’ golden geese.&&You all forgot about fucking Shrek.&&Totally agree and I hope they give Dean DeBlois the chance to create whatever the hell he wants after he is finished with the httyd franchise.&&This franchise has always been Dreamworks' diamond in the rough. Honestly, they're good enough to be part of Pixar's resume and I would even argue that they're considerably better than Pixar's recent output. They seem very...auteur-ish, I guess?

Almost every animated sequel I've seen has been a disappointment.  But I like HTYD 2 at least as much as One and maybe more.

I go years and years without going to see a movie in theatre but this trailer looks like this is going to be at least very good and I want to enjoy it in all it's latest animation glory.&&God, I hope so. But they will be up against Pixar with Toy Story 4 and Disney with Frozen 2. And then soft competition is Warner Bros with The Lego Movie 2, Illumination with The Secret Life of Pets 2, and Aardman with Shaun the Sheep 2. So many animated sequels next year. 

The first movie lost to Toy Story 3, so it's entirely possible that this one loses to the fourth.

Hiccup likely protects the dragons by having them disappear from the face of the earth. Having them be eradicated by humanity would be too dark even for this film. &&No way lol. It's even more spoilery. &&It basically shows the entire story. :( Wish they didn't do that.

You know, cause Stoick's kinda dead now.&&As glad as I am to see this (Butler!) the name I'm most interested in is John Powell's.  His score for the first movie is (imo) the best animated film score in the genre.  Beautiful, sweeping, epic, fun, lush, memorable, and powerful.

The other dragon species don't have that  weird human feminization. &&> The epilogue shows an elderly Hiccup who had built a new kingdom of harmony on Tomorrow where humans and dragons live in peace, but describing how the dragons which had been common in his youth were now rare sights, and how bards were writing stories which described dragons as mythological.&&The books imply that they were stories being told from a future point of view. In a sense, it's a sort of ""explanation"" as to why stories of dragons were always told in our history.&&You can't really look to the books for what's going to happen.

Prepare yourself for this sudden yet inevitable betrayal.&&How old *are* these kids? I wouldn’t have had the concept of putting something off on purpose until I was older until I already *was* much older.&&You came in like a dragonball&&Agreed. The relationship and character development really draws you in and makes you care.  I think Woody and Buzz have that same special place in my heart, in part because I've grown as a person as the characters have.  &&Agreed!  I also love the relationship that has grown between Hiccup and Astrid.

The scene that they have together at the beginning of the second film made me SO happy because you can see how well they communicate with and support each other.

It's such a tired trope in films to see the couple get together in the first film only to bicker and argue their way through the second to create artificial drama.

It's just one of many positive writing choices in this series that I absolutely LOVE.

It's also beautiful reflection of the main theme of the series.  Just as the Viking and the Dragons are stronger together, so are Hiccup and Astrid.

Excuse me, have to wipe some dust out of my eyes!&&There will be more now!


Assuming his mating dance works out.&&I had a similar thought on Astrid in the second movie.  I really felt the second movie undermined the message of the first.  So much of the first one was about a person's uniqueness is what makes them valuable, but to realize that value a person has to reject other's expectations and find the path that suits the individual best.

In the second, Stoick wanted Hiccup to be leader the next chief, and that expectation was never questioned.  It could have been a fresh approach on the same moral too.  In the first he wanted his father's approval and had to realize he would never be who his father wanted him to be; in the second he had his father's approval and would have wrestled with losing it to be true to himself.  Making Astrid chief would have been a clever bit of expectation inversion too, which I really appreciated about the first movie as well.&&holy fuck that's far.&&Oh of course, I'd almost forgotten about KFP, they were also fantastic, and again, not similar to your usual 'Dreamworks' (I'm sensing a pattern here). Great choreography and a perfectly cast Jack Black. &&Shrek? The studio has put out plenty of great hits. Not as much as Disney but they're no strangers to success.&&KF3 was ultra weak IMO, the first and second ones were good, but the quality degraded by the third one exponentially&&Kfp 1 and 2 are some of my favourite animated films ever. 3 was alright. &&Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite animated franchises of all time. Each movie is really solid both in storytelling and as a visual treat. I've seen various sources talking about how initially it was pitched as a 6 film franchise and I really hope so. I would be delighted for 3 more films if they keep up the quality.&&Thank you. I'm sitting here like the hell these people talking about? The spin-offs from Shrek were hugely successful too. Shit, Shrek was so huge my phone doesn't even auto correct it! &&Shrek 3, though...&&The first movie, yes, is a masterpiece and it's one of the great family friendly films although the animation quality is starting to really show its age. But every one after that was pretty terrible. It went from ""it's kind of funny to see people in medieval times acting like modern people"" to ""how many pop culture references can we fit in this every frame of this movie"" and lost the core heart that the original had. Luckily the HtTYD movies haven't fallen into the same trap.&&They feel a touch more mature overall than most Pixar films. Up has “the moment that makes you cry” and such, but the HTTYD movies let things that dark become consistent themes throughout, without going stupidly grimdark or anything. Things feel like there are real stakes for every conflict; Hiccup loses things. Like his foot, or his father. It makes it all more meaningful.

I loved to beat the tar out of Dreamworks when discussing how they could only Xerox whatever Pixar’s latest success was, but HTTYD has proven that they *do* have competent people on hand. They just need to keep showing this level of standards when it comes to choosing what material to work with.&&Can't wait for E3 cringe compilation 2018.&&I sure hope Jonsi and John Powell will make the scores, and I'm not too worried about the use of Ed Sheeran here, it's just a first trailer&&It's been confirmed that he will have a song in the movie.&&The moment Forbidden Friendship started playing in the trailer... time to go relisten to the soundracks.&&They're making a second Shaun the Sheep movie? Damn, 2019's looking to be a packed year for animation. &&It's fine. Lego 2 won't be nominated at all, so less competition already. &&Also don't forget Into the Spiderverse. Looks much different creatively than any of the other animated ventures you have mentioned.&&I'm still sitting here like why the *fuck* do we need a Toy Story 4? Toy Story 3 wrapped up the story very nicely.&&It was a strong year for animations. Lego movie didn't even get nominated. I'd have been happy with any of them winning tbh. &&I had BH6 no better than the fourth best animated movie that year and I had not even seen the foreign films that were so popular here as contenders. Disney-Pixar basically gets to keep that trophy a long as at least one of them produces a good movie every year.&&Don't get me wrong, BH6 was a superb movie and any other year it would have been my favorite animated film but HTTYD was just on another level. An absolutely fantastic movie and so heartbreaking as well 😓&&And The Lego Movie didn't even get nominated.&&BH6's first half was phenomenal, which makes it falling apart in the end really disappointing.&&The fact that Laika hasnt won anything yet is insane&&>The Oscars are a joke for Animation. 

The fact that Boss Baby received a nomination is all the evidence you need.

&&Your Name was beautiful. Anime should be in a category of it's own&&Big Hero 6 was really good though. Now the Lego Movie, that was fucking robbed&&*cough* The wind rises *cough*&&Seriously, A silent voice should have won this year and it wasn't even nominated! I'm sure almost no members of the academy even watched it (outside of those in the animation field maybe). &&I swear to god it's like The Tale of Princess Kaguya doesn't fucking exist. HTTYD2 was fantastic and better than BH6, but Kaguya blew both out of the water (and happens to be my all time favorite movie), the academy just collectively didn't watch it, so they voted for the one their kids liked, BH6. 

Good one, Oscars.&&I'm in the animation industry and from what I've been told from past professors (even one who votes in the Oscars), they don't really care much for animation. I've heard things like ""oh I just voted for the Disney film because my kid liked it"" and ""what's this anime film? Who cares...""&&doing the Lord's work son&&[deleted]&&Watched the trailer 3 times and laughed every time at that part. Based on the birds of paradise, I think.&&Blame snapchat and instagram stories/feed and video autoplay in feeds.

Too obvious that the dragon hunters are going to do something that forces them to send all the dragons away to this “hidden world” to stay safe. 

So bitter sweet ending were everyone is safe but the friendship between humans and dragons has to come to an end.&&Even the poster is extremely spoilery, too bad that's almost unavoidable.&&Seems like the whole movie may be a flashback. &&He was giving Stoick's dragon at the end of the 2 movie and implied he was staying. &&Norse mythology, right? forgot. my bad. 

&&Or how about they had Toothless fuckin' straight up murder Stoick in the second movie. That was... intense for a kids movie.&&The guy voiced by Craig Ferguson! “This is why I never married. This and one *other* reason.”&&Older overweight Viking with a peg leg. The guy who was talking about his ""sanitary"" soup in this trailer.&&It's one of those ""producers say he's gay but the movie itself is super vague"" thing. Not worth getting excited or upset about either way.&&Gobber is supposed to be gay, though calling him openly gay is a bit of a stretch.  It's more alluded to than anything&&I'm just tired of the love interest trope that's usually the main arc for the second or third movie in a trilogy&&Okay yeah. I'm gonna cry a lot at the end of this film. I'll just...get prepared for that. &&The opening statement, and Hiccup saying to toothless, ""It's always been you and me, it always will be.""

Yeah, they will part ways by the end of the movie....I'm calling it now.  I'm gonna cry at the end. Manly tears of sadness.&&So we definitely didn't domesticate them and breed them into extinction &&Also not a nightfury iirc. Hiccup also has a second dragon.&&[deleted]&&So based on that info and the film’s title all the dragons will migrate to the hidden world.&&Well my six year old prefers chapter books during reading time. So I was thinking of picking up a book and seeing how he likes it. 

I'm guessing these are chapter books from the sounds of it once I looked it up.  &&I prefer the books only because they're less cliché. Rather than hiccup having some super rare ultimate dragon whos fun and cute, he literally has the most common, stuck up, and almost ugly dragon around. Hiccup is never really respected and in a way it gives the book a lot more comedy and differnce. Movies are freakin good tho too.&&He is everything but a lizard 😆&&Niight timee... DAY TIME!&&[deleted]&&""Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this dragon, and you losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.""

we're queer

we're making all your threads better&&Plot twist: they spend all movie trying to find ""The Hidden World"" Only to find out thta the hidden world means afterlife for Dragons and he says goodbye to toothless at the end.

Then the last 10 mins of the movie are him and his lady telling the story to their 3 kids all old and stuff.

And they have a dog.

Named Toothless

And its black

And missing a leg.

And then theres a scene where his runt child is playing with ""Toothless"" that mimics the scene of him and toothless in the first movie.

And the final scene is a smiling scene.

Credits will be Imagine Dragons ""Whatever it takes""

And a song with Adam Levine.

I'll have the nachos but finish it in the previews.

It'll rain.

I'll see it on tuesday.

Little Hiccup's kids dragon riding Toothless' kids.  Too perfect and fitting in keeping with family values of the movies.  &&That's kind of the vibe I'm getting.

Can't be cooler than that.&&Nigga don't make me cry&&Oh sure, thanks for bringing the onions. 

My daughter isn’t old enough for these yet, but by the time this one is out on Blu-ray, I can’t wait to show her. &&Curse your sudden yet inevitable betrayal!&&To set the stage: my son is one of the most patient, gentle and self-controlled kids I've ever encountered.  He routinely passes on dessert, by his own volition, so that he doesn't eat ""too much sugar"".  He's extremely considerate of his friends and younger sister, and values fairness and sharing without us consciously pushing that character upon him.

I've got a plex library setup with many of the great children's movies, and some he looks at the box art and decides he's not ready for yet.  ""Maybe when I'm 7"", he says as a 6-year old (he's 7 now).

His younger cousins have seen much more violent and scary stuff.  I'd seen a couple of R-rated movies by his age (parents weren't aware - it was the 80's; thank you dad for buying a bunch of BETA tapes filled with HBO recordings back in 1986 from your co-worker).  But I'm not going to push him to bust the bubble he has.  It'll happen at its own pace.  And we'll catch all the good movies and tv shows eventually.

Meanwhile, he and his sister both love Labyrinth, so sometimes kids are just illogical.&&Won't they be hybrids?

Twilight Fury's&&I just tried to combine Night and Light Fury... and you... you can’t. It’s the same. &&February 1st for the UK and Ireland! &&Yeah that makes this trailer feel absurdly early. &&Really? Personally, I think KFP is peak Dreamworks. It's the same schtick they've been plugging for years, just done well for a change. Where the characters being animals actually ties into the story, and not just another, ""It's *Get Shorty* but they're fish for no reason lol"".

HTTYD is great, though. As backhanded a compliment as it may be, it's almost more of a Pixar franchise. Rough edges in there (Hiccup's mannerisms are a bit contemporary for the setting, but apparently you just can't stop Baruchel using the word ""Bud""), but I'm continually surprised by the quality across the entire property.&&I really love the art direction in the 3rd movie and love the story behind it about working with Chinese artists and teams to help make it.  Story wise, I thought it was just 'good' but the art style and the score were beautiful.&&Lemme try: Schreck. You're right!&&Still better than the 4th one...

^(I actually remember basically nothing about 3 and 4, so I make no actual claims as to their relative quality.)&&IMHO, Shrek 2 was better. Maybe not as classic, but overall better.&&Aka the entire Ubisoft conference every year.&&Pretty sure John Powell is returning. They also played Forbidden Friendship in the trailer.

EDIT: [Yup, confirmed in AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8pavz1/im_dean_deblois_director_of_the_how_to_train_your/e09ybr3/).&&Jonsi also helped make “For the Dancing and the Dreaming” if I recall correctly. I think he composed the melody with John Powell and the lyrics were written by a third musician. &&I for one welcome our new overlords of animations for next year.&&That's going to be a part of 2018's Oscar season while the movies I mentioned are a part of the 2019 Oscar season.&&The Lego movies are being deliberately snubbed.

Damn, I think I'm going to watch it again today.&&Your name was so good that my partner, who loaths subtitles, sat through it and at the end refused to give me an opinion, while I could still see the tears on her face.&&i agree with that sentiment actually

it wouldn't even be close, the likes of your name, redline, sword of the stranger etc are absolutely fucking ridiculous for 2d animation&&I can already tell I'm going to die laughing while watching this movie.&&I get that, but then why put it in front of the full trailer on youtube? There is absolutely no need to do that.&&Kind of crazy how ancient Scandinavians formed an entire religion based on a Marvel character.&&Ah yes, because nothing says ""openly gay"" like ambiguity&&They don't, anywhere, in any of the TV shows either, imply or say he is gay

Edit: Apparently the director did. But that makes no sense because Gobber says one of his first loves was a woman. OP, i disagree it was not ""groundbreaking"" in the sense of an openly gay character because they don't even talk about that, like ever.&&that's the one legged guy right?&&Like, someone can have the most interesting life full of adventures and self discovery but at some point they need to throw that away and settle down. 

""You're only a complete character until you find your soul mate. Every satisfactory ending needs a breeding pair.""
 
Though to be fair How to Train Your Dragon handled that trope in as muted a tone as they could. Hiccup and Astrid's relationship was never really the forefront of either of the other movies, just a small part.&&well Spielberg did too when he read the script.  &&Well then prepare for the waterworks here and now:  

> One of the focus groups used to preview the film was so moved by the ending scene, they insisted the directors keep their decision to make Hiccup an amputee as they connected with it and though it was daring.
> 
> A kid among the group said “It was sad because Hiccup lost something but then he gained so much more”.

Edit since people aren't understanding.  This was in reference to the first movie.  The clip is from the end of the first movie.  &&If I don't watch it, it never happens, right? &&[deleted]&&And I thought HTTYD2 was bad enough. I'm not ready for the sadness this one will bring.&&Spoiler alert, or at least it better be. From the opening to the end the story is Hiccup splitting up with Toothless, who goes to live in the ""Secret World"" with the lightfury in order to save him. As the movie closes Hiccup's narration ends as he goes inside, saying something like ""There are only rumors now, that people have seen a Nightfury."" He checks if anyone is watching him before slipping through a secret door ""But I don't believe those rumors."" He descends down a set of cave stairs ""Because Toothless is way too fast to be seen"" cue Toothless knocking Hiccup down as several baby Nightfuries move in to lick him. Movie ends to audience cheering.&&Is this going to be the conclusion of the How To Train Your Dragon film series?&&FTR, these movies are some of the loosest adaptations of a book series I've ever seen. In the books, Hiccup pretty much remains an awkward, unpopular, gangly little boy and Toothless is a tiny, sassy, hunting dragon. I don't expect the movie to have a very similar ending at all. &&And he's honestly a little bitch. Like, unlikeable. A lot of the characters are different. &&And Fishlegs was a berserker.

Putting aside his “I’m not old enough” for a moment, though: do you think he’d actually enjoy watching it now if he DID let himself do so? Or would the themes be something he actually wouldn’t enjoy yet?

I ask because he seems like he could be in the perfect age range for it, in which case there’s room to try and convince him without actually bursting his bubble. Since he’s approaching these decisions very maturely, you should feel free to reply as if he’s mature enough to discuss the matter even though he’s just 7. And I don’t mean push him hard on it; that’s bursting his bubble. But I think he could take a bit of “I think you *are* old enough for this; do you want to maybe give it a try and see?” Convincing him to occasionally stretch his perception of his own boundaries can be good for growth.&&Nick Fury’s? &&Little Panda dragons?&&Nightlight Fury?&&Twilight Fury.&&HUZZAH&&Dont forget about EA&&Enlighten me why are they deliberately snubbed?&&Oddly enough, I disliked Kubo immensely due to its third act. The first two acts were solid and rather delightful, but the story fell apart for me and the final message is a *horrible* message to teach children. Having survived abusive relatives, their handling of that whole plot point was done extremely poorly.&&And then I'm gonna die crying probably&&youtube links can be shared on blogs and articles with autoplay too ...&&r/notkenm&&Yup. Apparently Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie character in Thor 3 was ""the first bisexual MCU hero"" or something, but a crucial scene was cut. But if you don't make it clear to the audience, it doesn't do anything for representation.&&Believe it or not, peg leg viking is pansexual.

Could you elaborate on that?

No.&&I hate this new trend of saying a character is x, y or z, but its not anywhere in the film. I was glad when some people balked at the whole ""lando is pansexual"" bs, because there's nothing in the film that definitively proves that, its just people making up bullshit afterwards for good boy points.&&No that's hiccup &&The way Astrid and Hiccup were handled is one of my favourite depictions of a relationship in film/tv. Very natural and muted. No over the top crap.&&It's because most people want a kind love interest&&Well, there's no way for the dragons to continue as a species without breeding!

Cubone: ""Cubone, known as the Lonely Pokémon, appears to be a small, brown, dinosaur-like Pokémon that constantly wears its deceased mother's skull like a helmet... Cubone's real face has never been seen before, thanks to its bone mask. When it thinks of its dead mother, it cries.""
http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Cubone    

Yamask: Yamask is a shadow-like Pokémon holding a mask that has a face from its time as a human. A mask that resembles its ORIGINAL HUMAN FACE. Due to being a human long ago, it has memories of being a human. If someone wears the mask Yamask carries, they will become possessed by the Yamask in question. Sometimes, it looks at this mask and cries, apparently in longing.

I feel like they would have failed as movies if they kept to the books though.&&They can't all write the showtunes.&&you're mad about nachos?&&Got really specific at the end there&&I won't be. As disappointing as that ending would be for some, it means time travel is real, so hey! Not all bad!&&I wish I could experience these clips for the first time again. &&I was under the impression that Del Toro was always going to make two movies. Which made sense to me.&&I would like the alternate universe where they hired PJ from the start and didn't let Del Toro make all of the Pre-Production decisions like massive amounts of CGI.&&They don’t stop coming and they don’t stop coming and they don’t stop coming...&&It sounds like a line you would hear in a movie about the making of Schindler's List.&&> Forbidden Friendship 

One of my favorites and my heart flutters when I hear it.  Am I still a man....would a man say this;\  Oh well...&&One of the best pieces of cinematic composition ever. It's so perfect. I well up every time I hear it.&&John Powell is fucking great. He did the score for *Solo* too, not that it's doing it any good unfortunately.&&Kind of like a big game hunter then. Interesting. Sounds like i'm going to have to buy the movies. Its been far too long since I've seen them. &&In time man, dont rush it. I was definitely way to young mentally to handle it but you have to do what it takes. Find a nice girl (yeah I say that like it's easy) and make sure you're ready...both of you. I grew up in a split family and unfortunately so has my daughter. It shows sometimes in her behavior as shes understanding more but its manageable. Being a father has taught me to use a lot patience with everything in life so my advice...patience &&Developmentally, he'd totally connect with the themes.  Especially as he's proven me wrong a time or two, much like Hiccup shows everyone else was incorrect.  The loyalty and bond between Hiccup and Toothless would be something he'd relate to as well.

I get the desire to stretch boundaries for healthy growth - its part of my motivation sometimes (I also like that we don't have to deal with him having nightmares - 80's movies certainly gave me plenty. Gremlins at 6, Child's Play at 9 were the two biggest offenders).  We watched the Lego Movie and when it broke the 4th wall and jumped to ""real life"", he...flipped...out.  But now he loves Calvin and Hobbes and can understand a protagonist using his imagination and the juxtaposition that sometimes presents.  I think he's ready - it's almost more waiting for #2 to age a little bit so she can join in.  And we've got until next spring so the timing will hopefully work out great.

Thanks for your words of encouragement.&&At the end of the movie, Toothless is enjoying his new life.

He stumbles upon a massive dragon looking away from him. The dragon slowly turns its head. It's Smaug.

""Toothless, I'm here to talk to you about the Dragon Cinematic Universe.""

*Toothless cocks his head inquisitively*

**Roll Credits**&&Long as they all have eye patches I'm cool with it.&&Bap them on the head and they change between black and white.&&The fact that the films are based on a toy line may cause some of the older Academy voters to think that they are not worthy of a nomination (despite them actually being some of the better written animated films of the year). &&There's a feeling that they're just overblown advertisements and therefore undeserving of recognition. &&That's a good question nobody has an *official* answer to yet, the Academy has been very reluctant to get into it. 

Originally, the Academy tried to pin it on the live action scenes, but the official Oscar criteria stated that up to 25% of an animated film could be live action. The Lego Movie was far below that. They were called out for the obvious contradiction but chose not to comment and address it.

And then the year The Lego Batman Movie should have been among the nominated, they were passed over for Boss Baby. It's agreed by all but a very few (among both professionals in the film industry and us viewers) that it was definitely a snub.

The most likely reason for these snubs is that the Academy in general dislikes meta pop culture, superhero, and anime films. Counter argument to this is that Wreck It Ralph has been nominated in the past, as were Big Hero 6 and The Tale of Princess Kaguya and The Wind Rises and Spirited Away before that. On the other hand, all five of those examples were either Disney or Miyazaki produced - both have a very favorable nostalgia and history with the Academy. If the issue is general bias, it's a matter of an Academy and voting process that has not aged well and kept pace with modern genre changes and what constitutes good story telling.

The more conspiratorial theories argue they have something against Lord and Miller specifically, or that even *Disney* is complicit in bribing or pressuring nomination decisions. These don't hold much water though - Lord and Miller wouldn't be the first professionals to be passed over and over despite stellar delivery, and the latter would be an outright scandal that could severely damage the Disney brand (I seriously doubt anyone in the company would take such a stupid unethical risk). Not to mention that if Disney were so inclined to bribe their way to victories, their Marvel films have yet to benefit from any theorized meddling.
&&But he stood up to his grandfather. He didn't let him have control over him and had the relationship on *his* terms. The grandfather is basically a different person at they point, too, due to the memory loss. &&A circle of hell for all of them!&&And they'll continue to do that. They'll say off-screen that a character is gay or pan or whatever for diversity points, but they'll never show it overtly on-screen because they're trying to appeal to Chinese audiences. That means no gays and no ghosts.

I agree he has the smoothest accent.

Not sure why.&&What if he plays Stuntman Mike’s older brother?  Mike said his bro got him into the business starting off doing western TV shows...

That’s why I never question a Tarantino cast even if it’s someone who you haven’t heard of in a couple decades. &&she just gets all the good roles eh?

This movie isn’t lacking for star power to begin with, so it isn’t equivalent to, say, Daniel Craig getting 20 million for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

&&""I have to say... that's damn good stuff, sir.""

And seriously, Michael Fassbender is just awesome in general. Say what you want about Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, but he was flawless in those movies.&&That scene made me a Fassbender fan instantly back when the movie came out. I had never heard of him before and started watching all his movies, even Fish Tank which is a great indie movie. It’s such a shame that in recent years he’s made some very poor choices like Assassin’s Creed and other bad movies, because when the film isn’t great his performance is usually fantastic. 

As another guy pointed out, you might not like Prometheus or Alien Covenant but he is absolutely fantastic in them. Also, he is amazing as Magneto, the scene in the bar in X-men first class is a classic. &&Interesting, I always thought he was German which he half is I learned after googling but he has an irish mother and was raised in Ireland. I've never seen him speak out of character so now I'm really curious as to what he sounds like. &&The extremely posh Received Pronunciation accent was never a natural accent but a sort of artificial, non-regional (but based on south-eastern dialects) accent that the upper class learned in elite boarding schools. It's also often called the BBC accent because that was how BBC newsreaders were required to speak back in the day, while regional accents were seen as uneducated. 

There's hardly anyone who speaks quite in that clipped, highly enunciated, and rather nasal register of RP anymore except for members of the older generation like the queen (and even her accent has been toned down over the years). &&I now wish somebody would recut this scene with Austin Powers quotes whenever he speaks&&I still can’t believe Quentin let him change into his Love Guru costume midmovie but it worked&&Extremely downvoted comments get deleted unless they have gold or something to that effect &&Yeah he's mentioned multiple times the idea of a 1930's Bonnie & Clyde-type movie set in Australia, and I could totally see Margot Robbie in that female role for a number of reasons:

1) She's Australian so we won't have to suffer some American actor more than likely butcher the accent. 
2) She knows how to play crazy. Her performance was one of the only redeeming things about Suicide Squad for me. 
3) She's now got a working partnership with QT and he's not exactly against working with the same people twice.&&You NEVAH open your mouth until you know what the shot is.

Honestly this is the first film in a long time I see the names on the marquee making a huge difference in terms of getting butts on seats. &&Certainly there’s some people that will go for Tarantino. But DiCaprio is an actor that you’re pretty much guaranteed to always get a solid movie from. I would say your average moviegoer would go see a movie if they see him on the poster.&&This might be the kind of thing an agent does to try & get his actor client & himself publicity & good will.

And ""Look how much money this guy makes, but he's willing to make a noble sacrifice for great art.""&&His tarantino impression is spot on.&&I love this.

On a side note--I've met QT! I've run into a lot of celebrities and that was probably the most starstruck I've been.&&Damn you can tell that's real respect, that's not blowing smoke up the dude's ass.

The [story came out](https://deadline.com/2017/12/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-movie-jj-abrams-1202220032/) about a year later that he pitched the story to Abrams for Star Trek.

It's a long time to change his mind.
&&When he sees django: ""old it roit there, bleck"" yes, there you go quentin, proud of you mate &&THAT'S NOT MY FINGER!!!&&with nail polish?&&Fucking amateurs&&Yeah, I seem to recall that he considered naming “Inglourious Basterds” “Once Upon a Time in France” or something like that. He’s a Leone fan.&&I'm sure he won't be doing the same structure, but I could see him thinking ""I want to make my OUATIA"".  Who knows what that means to him, but in general I'd assume it would be a long ass movie. 

At the very least that movie is going to be at the top of his mind and he is a very influence driven creator.&&It's set around the Manson Murders, so I'm sure there will be plenty of fucked up things in it.  

I find the rape scene in OUATIA interesting because it is a profoundly tragic movie about regret.  

We are not supposed to sympathize with the character but we are supposed to understand how he came to that point.  We watch him grow from a somewhat troubled kid into a rich gangster.  The whole film he struggles between the life that Deborah is offering and the life that Max is offering him.  He ends up screwing up both of those lives by not choosing which life he wants to live.  He gets his friends all killed trying to stop being a criminal, and when he doesn't get what he wants on the date he falls back into the ""take what you want"" criminal mindset and rapes the girl he has been in love with since childhood.  He then crawls into an opium den and fantasizes about the rest of his life (I buy into the theory that everything after he goes into the opium den is in his imagination). 

What I love about the movie is that the film itself doesn't really feel like it is judging any of the characters.  We are presented with pretty much the entire life of Noodles.  The good, the bad, the ugly (I couldn't resist) and are left with only Noodles' judgment of himself.  How you feel about him as a character is left up to the individual viewer.&&Thanks. I was afraid that nobody might get the reference.  Im glad you have a a great mind. &&I always wanted to know the gimp's story both before and after the pawn shop scene. Was he Zeds retarded brother? Also did Marcelus and the pipe hitting niggers kill him along with Zed? Did they just leave him and he was found later wandering around LA in a gimp suit and became a ward of the state? Was he a normal dude who just enjoyed the gimp fetish? Maybe Zed had a sister and took him in? Someone write some gimp fan fiction. &&That sounds awesome. He already seems to have a hard time constraining to a time limitation.

I think I read somewhere that that was the original idea very early on. Seems like maybe a bit too much care was taken on the dinosaur animation just for a pre-vis.&&The blocking in this scene is what's really amazing&&I kept waiting for the reveal that it was just a Robot Chicken skit&&[deleted]&&This strikes me as almost something that would be made after the movie to pay homage to the film, that's how good it is. Not to mention how in sync it is to the final product. (Or, realistically, how the final product is in sync with it.) Spielberg and company definitely had a vision here. It's more terrifying at that.

P.S. Tim is one lucky mofo in any version of this scene.&&I want to see the whole movie remade this way, with all the actors as puppets except Jeff Goldblum.

And I want to see another remake where all characters are played by Jeff Goldblum, including the dinosaurs.&&This is not a previz but a test too see if stop motion would work for the dinosaurs. This animation was done by Phil Tippet’s (of Star Wars fame) team who later went on to animate the 3D models that was chosen for the final film. 

*edit: fame, not game&&That's still as scary as it ever was.&&This must have been before they decided to swap Tim and Lexie’s  roles for the film. Tim looks older than her which is how the book was written. &&I forgot how terrifying that scene actually is.  Even stop motion makes my heart speed up.&&I just watched this movie for like the 100th time a couple days ago.  Still holds up. Heck this previsualization from the early 90s looks better than what some lower budget movies and tv shows put out today. &&Pfffft totally inaccurate to the final product, they left out [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/XydtZ4Z)&&Jurrasic Park is frightening in the dark...&&A minor quibble. 

I was always somewhat disappointed that they went to the lengths to characterize one specific raptor as **""The Big One"".** Exclaiming how much of a nightmare she was in the prior scenes. [With Muldoon saying that she took over the pride and killed all but two of the other raptors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwAOHVBKTwg&feature=youtu.be&t=107) And yet here in this stop motion AND in the final product, all of the raptors were functionally identical. Both in size and colouration. There's no distinguishing markings so we never found out which of the three was that nasty one.

I mean, it's no doubt more cost effective to order up a dozen or so identical costumes and anamatronics. But it just seemed like a bit of a bummer.

It wouldn't have been too difficult either I reckon. Since in that scene at the beginning, Muldoon is screaming [""shoot her""](https://youtu.be/qz5JmgLQEzs?t=194), and then you hear the discharing of rifles. You could imply that this is the Big One and have one of models covered in buck shot scars all over its hide. Giving it a grizzled appearance. Same sized consume and rig, just a different skin.

It's not a big problem. It's just I remember seeing that scene where Ellie and Muldoon are about to head to the utility shed, and then the camera pans sideways to show the raptor paddock wires as twisted and broken. And I was like *""holy fuck, The Big One is loose!""*. And then it's just three visually identical raptors.&&I don't know why I hadn't thought about it before, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened if she'd have just *thrown* the spoon instead for this scene&&All of the visual effects were originally planned to be in stop motion. But once the director saw a demo reel of the computer visual effects, he changed everything around. The guy who was in charge of the stop motion, an animator named Phil Tippet, stayed on the crew to help with the visual effects. He later went on to found his own vfx studio, Tippet Studios, which specialized in monster animation, even though he had his roots in stop motion. If technology hadn’t taken a huge leap around this time, this “previsualization” would have been exactly what the film looked like (minus the doll kids and sketches).&&Wow. It kind of amazes me they had the balls to make this movie when they did, considering the effects of the time. I kinda miss that era. This movie was a goddamn event when it came out. Movies can’t do that anymore.&&I love how if you say “Raptor Kitchen” everyone knows what you’re talking about.  &&If only they used doorknobs instead of handles... (c"" ತ,_ತ)&&**A Roger Corman production**

**THERE ARE DINOS IN MY KITCHEN**&&It's not just a previsualization. They were going to do the whole movie using stop motion animation for the Dinosaurs. CG had never gone as far a building an entire living creature on screen before. They went to ILM to ask them to do the motion blur for the stop motion and one of the guys thought to himself, ""why don't we just build the whole damned thing in CGI?""

He secretly built an entire T-Rex and had it up on his screen walking when the producers were coming in as a sort of, ""Oops, you weren't supposed to see that"" type of thing. They saw it and asked, ""Can you really do that and make it all look that good?!?"" he said yes and they abandoned the stop motion animation that Phil Tippett was hired to do and kept him on as a dinosaur supervisor type of role. &&It's literally an animatic, not a stop motion demo like lot of people are saying. I was just watching the original making of behind the scenes narrated by James Earl Jones. They did traditional storyboards, but when they decided to go cg, they realized they needed 3d storyboards, and more or less invented animatics. But since CG wasn't at the point t that modern CG is, they made the animatics with primitive stop motion clay figures. This let them understand the geomtry, pacing, posing, timing, and movement better than a series of 2d pictures.&&Very cool. It's super interesting to me how similar this scene is to the one in the movie.

Also the concept that they did all this stop motion merely as a test. I wonder how long it took. &&Looks better than Jurassic World&&Tim Burton Presents: Jurassic Park&&I was gonna just watch a few seconds to get the gist, ended up watching the entire thing.

It has fluids and gives you the idea how they should shoot this.&&I’m posting this again in the hopes people see it:

This IS Previsualization. They were called “Animatics”.

According to Phil Tippet and Steven Spielberg in the Making of documentary from 2000, this sequence was a previsualization. Sure, storyboards were done, but the decision was made to make these stop motion scenes to figure out how these very complicated sequences were going to go.

One was also made for the T-Rex breakout sequence. The quality of the animation was NOT exactly what they were going to do for the stop-motion dinosaurs (which were going to be much more realistic). In fact, you can see what the “final” look for them was going to be in that same documentary.

“I came up this routine for the raptors..so I thought we’ll have that raptor stick out his tongue; then when Horner saw the Animatics of that he ya know just came down on us like a ton of bricks and said, ‘Who’s stupid idea was that?’ laughs ‘Mine sir.’ He said, ‘No! They can never do that!’” -Phil Tippet&&The tongue flicking was taken out for being too snake like.  &&It's amazing how close the camera angle and animations are to the final product. &&Im sorry but you forgot the stage hand helping hold up the raptor in the doorway&&No toe tap? &&Watching thus, I heard every sound effect in my head.  The raptor hissing, s reaches, clicks...  the tap tap tap of the metal spoon. I even heard the orchestration rising in panic as Tim ran for the freezer. 

I think I may have seen this movie too many times.  &&Better than cgi&&This is one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen in a film and proof of the difference between the level of filmmaking that went into the original Jurassic park vs the new ones.&&Those is so strange and impressive all at once. Look at the detail on the dinosaurs and then the lumps of plastic that are the children. The combination is strangely unsettling&&Ah yes, loved the Thunderbirds episode where they had to save people from Velociraptors.&&These are the type of people who have a $1.3 mil budget on a bungalo in San Fran on HGTV.  &&I’m not sure if the tongues make it funnier or scarier....&&This looks like some sort mid 70's tv show.

Lol.&&r/noisygifs&&Can somebody please PLEASE put sound to this!?&&This was one of the best scenes from the movie! I’m glad they got rid of that tongue flickering.&&i tell ya, jurassic park is frightning in the dark&&Back in the halcyon days of stop-motion being in any way easier/more affordable than CGI.&&Seeing the snake tongue that they eventually removed from the film is very interesting. Also with practical effects this form of visualization must have been extremely helpful for the crew. &&I live by the guy that made these puppets. &&This is NOT pre-visualition. This was a test to see if they could do the movie in stop-animation. &&God I wish today's movies were this patient...&&Fun fact: The team that did the CGI for the movie was very talented at the tech but were pure shit at making the dinosaur movements seem realistic. Meanwhile the stop motion team tech was basically ""going extinct"" but the team had spent their careers focusing on realistic movement, so they still found a huge roll to play in the movie even after the studio ditched stop motion. &&I can hear the scene playing just from the visual cues.

Really neat, I didn't know they did this, but it seems like a great way to convey what the director is looking for as opposed to sketches and such.

I suppose these days it would be done with 3d modeling rather than claymation though?&&This film is just a masterpiece honestly&&God i can feel the syspense just from this

The first jyrassic park was a gem of a movie like no other. None of the newer ones can even compare imo&&Experts would later complain about the “zombie” like way in which the raptors held their arms.  And I gotta say it didn’t hit me until later that these things are birds, so the reflexive way they would hold their arms would of course mimic their descendants.

Edit: thank you dictionary fairy. &&I believe he also told them that raptors are not that tall and it would be impossible for them to fog up the window of the kitchen door. The paleontologist was promptly fired, and in the second movie he styles the antagonists' resident paleontologist to look like the fired guy. I can't remember exactly, but I'm pretty sure that character got ripped apart by dinosaurs. &&[deleted]&&>dinosaurs didn't do that

I wonder if there's evidence from the fossils of tongue structure. Otherwise that seems like an overly definitive statement for a scientist to make.

Especially when you consider that this movie also goes ahead and says that *Dilophosaurus* had a frill and spit venom. Though in that case a whole scene is built around those features, so I could imagine the paleontologist telling them that those shouldn't be there and basically being told ""too bad.""

With the raptor tongue you can change that to sniffing with minimal disruption to the scene. And frankly while the flicking tongue is neat to think about, I think I find them sniffing the air more threatening. The tongue makes me think of snakes, but the sniffing makes me think of wolves.&&Here's a [production still](https://i.imgur.com/OA0Ff6b.png) of that same paleontologist demonstrating the Dilophosaurus scene&&Like they cared about any accuracy, especially with the raptors.  Way too big, and blew it off by saying they’re “genetically enhanced to be larger”&&I thought the tongue flicking added to the dramatics. Made me think of them more as crazy ass komodo dragons&&Yeah but if any of them read the book, they would know that they had all sorts of behaviors and biology that weren't natural to them because they were created by splicing a lot of different animal DNA to fill in the missing gaps in the dinosaur DNA. 

It's how the t-rex reproduces even though they never created a male, because of the frog DNA it had.&&I love the tongue flicking. It adds something to it.&&> I think I read somewhere that that was the original idea very early on.

[You're absolutely right.](https://youtu.be/KWsbcBvYqN8)

&&It's a step between storyboard and filming + CGI editing. Essentially a moving storyboard    
It allows post production to have a visual reference of what the director wants to see before all the money is thrown into the final rendering.&&Yeah it was supposed to be the biggest and best stop motion effects production ever made headed by the premier stop motion shop of the time Tippet Studios run by Phil Tippet. They created some killer stop motion shots as a small experimental group doing computer graphics at ILM was doing their own experiments in animation. They put together an experimental cg animated sequence which blew Spielberg away in it's fluidity so they scrapped the stop motion stuff in favor of CG animation. Phil Tippet had a nervous breakdown as he saw the end of the stop motion empire he spent his life building. ILM, though, didn't have the animation chops at the time to actually animate the dinosaurs realistically so they created stop motion armatures that connected to the computer which allowed the Tippet Studio animators to animate in the way they were comfortable with and pose the armatures frame by frame and capture that pose in the computer where the ILM team would light, render, and composite it.&&That's what I was thinking. Why go through all this trouble when you could just shoot the scene a couple times instead and it would be a lot easier than doing this complex motion capture?&&[Another ](https://youtu.be/7xjfCyYhRTM)  great video to watch and learn about the stop motion in more detail. The Making of Jurassic Park&&I believe they used stop motion puppets to record the animation for the cgi.&&I heard from the special features of the DVD back in the day that they were stop motion until about halfway through production when they realized they could do some amazing CG. they didn't just fire the stop motion guy either, they layered the CG over his stop motion which is why the dinosaurs move as well as they look. Super ahead of its time. &&This has probably already come up but the animator was a guy called Phil Tippett. He also did a load of work on Star Wars and other cool stuff. Check out this VICE video about his career, its really interesting. Jump to about 12:30 for the Jurassic Parc stuff. [https://youtu.be/VTGQ\_K0DBPo](https://youtu.be/VTGQ_K0DBPo)&&For real. The way the camera work characterizes the raptors as animals but also intelligent creatures is awesome. That last slow zoom is like ""those fuckers are dangerous... locked Bertha in the freezer... this got personal.""&&TIL what blocking is&&This is top flight scene blocking no doubt&&[Insert someone shitting themselves inconveniently]&&Except for the intercut storyboard images, this totally looked like *Robot Chicken*&&It looks like what Robot Chicken would look like if it was on PBS.  ^(Hopefully this makes sense.)&&This is what the Robot Chicken skit was rehearsing for.  Notice how the third Velociraptor missed his mark and wasn't in this scene.   
&&Yeah, but not a cutout paper mouth to be seen. &&I've seen that movie/scene a dozen times and it's always terrifying. I always feel like something bad is gonna happen. &&Could anyone else hear the raptors?&&It builds tension almost perfectly. The scene is dimly lit. There is only one entrance and exit. The previous parts of the movie have set up in your mind how intelligent the raptors are. But this scene adds to that trope by having them open door handles and particularly calling the other raptor.  There is stalking involved which even without the raptors is kinda terrifying. But these stalkers happen to be not only bigger then you but faster as well. Also by this point in the film you have an emotional attachment to the kids and want to see them live , so all the close calls especially the pantry door jamming scene makes you think that the kids might just die. The fact the escape against all odds makes the scene even more intense. &&[deleted]&&Also, the fact that this scene is only just under 3 minutes long is insane. It's *that* suspenseful.&&That would make the “Alan!“-scene in JP3 even more hilarious&&In high heels&&Phil as in ""you had one job, Phil""?&&I kind of figured that was the case. A Pre-vis wouldn't need to be so well animated surely.&&I know Adam Jones (Tool guitarist) helped on this movie... and since he did a lot of stop motion for Tool videos it makes me think he was involved with this exercise too&&Well, the animatics Phil Tippet's crew created were still used as reference for what they shot later, so it was sorta used a previs.&&It's literally an animatic, not a stop motion demo like lot of people are saying. I was just watching the original making of behind the scenes narrated by James Earl Jones. They did traditional storyboards, but when they decided to go cg, they realized they needed 3d storyboards, and more or less invented animatics. But since CG wasn't at the point t that modern CG is, they made the animatics with primitive stop motion clay figures. This let them understand the geomtry, pacing, posing, timing, and movement better than a series of 2d pictures.&&I'm reading the book now and I'm so glad they changed up the kids a tad from the book. Tim did everything (he even got to fix the computer) while Lex was a whiny kid that almost got them killed several times. It's probably the only character change from the book that I actually liked in the movie.&&It’s crazy to think that there are only about 15 minutes of dinos in JP1, 9 of which are actually practical. CGI was used sparsely, but it was so good that it really holds up - mostly (the scenes out in the open in broad daylight are clear outliers).

The problem with CGI nowadays is that it’s such a low-margin business that most work gets outsourced to the studios and artists that present themselves as the “cheapest and fastest”. The quality of the results is then obviously affected.&&Imo JP looks better than any marvel movie. Some restraint with special effects and clever directing is so much more visually interesting and overall exciting for me. &&Thank you for destroying what I considered a perfect film.&&Its just a pervert groping the raptor.&&Damn you! I'm gonna try real hard to forget I ever saw this. &&***NOOOOOOO!*** *What have you dooooone*&&They cut the subplot where Hammond is working with the raptors to kill his grandkids to collect the insurance money.  &&I was looking for this comment lol&&Thanks for pointing that out, I love finding the little flaws in perfect movies, it makes them more human.

It’s like the “DJ Night, no cover” sign in Buffy.&&All the dinosaurs are running wild.&&The ""Big One"" is the raptor that tackles Muldoon and later opens the door latch to the command center. But I agree, they definitely missed the opportunity to have her more visually distinct.&&Your complaint never even occured to me, but the proposed solution would have been great.&&I think they throw something earlier in the movie and the raptors look at the origin of the thrown object and not where it lands&&there is no spoon&&I think she did the right thing, a thrown spoon would have clattered, but her tap-tap is clearly “prey.”

And, of course, the cinematic reason is equivalent. A clattering spoon would either require a cut to Lex when our focus is on Tim and the Raptor, or it would be distracting as the audience tried to reason out why a spoon might clatter (was it one of the ones that Tim disturbed? Did the other raptor bump it? Etc.). The tap-tap can only be coming from one source, so it allows Lex to have some agency without a distracting cut.&&""the director"". You know, Steven Spielberg.&&>all of the effects

Not all, just the ones that were eventually replaced with digital shots - the full-body motion stuff. Back in the early 90s they were still doing plenty of practical effects; the first part of this scene and lots of close-ups of the raptors are all guys in amazingly crafted costume-puppets. 

There's actually surprisingly little 100% CGI in the movie, for how much it's considered a revolutionary effects film. Just six minutes of screen time uses all-digital dinosaurs.&&Played his cards perfectly.&&I honestly think that part of the reason the CGI in JP is so *good* is that they’d already taken the time to get the motions right, so the animators weren’t flying blind. Even today, CGI effects can lack a certain tactility, but having the puppets and costumes as references helped a great deal.&&Thank you! For the past couple hours I’ve been trying to make this clear in the comments but they’re all getting buried. Top comments don’t always mean “most accurate” this just means a collective of uniformed people all agreed with each other. 

It’s really irritating. &&Kids: ""only the Dinos understand me""&&In this particular instance the raptor is calling to let the other raptor know that it has found prey, so not quite what you mean, but I do agree that it is absurd for a large ambush predator like a tyrannosaurus to stop and roar (which dinosaurs probably didn't do anyway) before attacking it's prey.&&This is a function of storytelling, not biology. It looks cool and sounds scary, so humans are entertained.&&False. That is literally impossible.&&Stupider&&[deleted]&&>Experts would later complain about the “zombie” like way in which the raptors held their arms.

Yup.  Dromaeosaurs basically held their 'hands' with their claws facing inwards and could rotate them so that their claws would face upwards.   They physically couldn't rotate their wrists so their claws would face downwards.&&Similar note, no theropod could pronate their hands. The classic ""claws down"" look on virtually every representation of Tyrannosaurs and Dromaeosaurs/Eudromaeosaurs was impossible for them. They'd be more in a wrist-bent down, grasping position facing inward.&&These things aren't birds. They're therapods. They had hallow bones 3 fingers and toes, and feathers. Birds were descendents of therapods but they are avian dinosaurs. Velociraptors-non avian dinosaurs.&&The dinos are the ancestors. What you mean to say is, they would mimic their descendants or better put, resemble their descendants.&&One thing about their hands that is still wrong is that they hold them with the claws in a vertical position, pointing downwards. In reality they would have to break their wrists to do so and they actually held their hands horizontally with their claws pointing towards each other. &&Jack Horner is the inspiration for Alan Grant. Bob Bakker is the inspiration for the ill-fated paleontologist from JPII.

They both advised on Jurassic Park (as far as wiki tells me).

Horner is famous for advancing the theory that T-Rex was a scavenger. Bakker advocates that it was a hunter.

When the Bakker-proxy got eaten in JPII, he wrote Horner to say ""See! I told you it was a hunter!""&&Eaten by the Trex because a snake went down his shirt and made him freak out as they were hiding from said Rex. Stupid death.&&You’re thinking of Bob Bakker, who never worked on the Jurassic films, let alone was fired from them. His sort of friendly rival, Jack Horner, has been the lead paleontologist on most of the films.

The character of Robert Burke, however, is clearly a parody/caricature of Bakker. Bakker even messaged Horner after seeing TLW saying “see, T-Rex WAS a hunter” in regards to “him” being eaten.

I’ve had the pleasure of meeting both, and gotta say Bakker is the cooler guy, if for no other reason than Horner was 100% responsible for the T-Rex getting jobbed out in JPIII to the Spinosaurus.&&Until soon after the movie came out and deinonychus was discovered and looked exactly like the “velociraptors” in the movie. 

Edit: not deinonychus. I meant Utahraptor. &&Those ""velociraptors"" were probably based on the utah raptors.  Not velociraptors.  

Edit: heard from other commenters that it was not the utah raptor.  It was deinonychus&&Sure!&&We know a lot about dinosaurs from looking at their muscle scars. Meaning the points where the muscle anchors to the bone. So we know things like the T-Rex had very strong arms, and that dilophosaurs didn't have frills or spit venom. As well as Raptors not doing the snake tongue.&&As you mentioned, the tongue flicking is a snake/reptile thing, because they are able to use it to sense things around them,  Not just because it makes them look weird.

I think its pretty justified to be pretty definitive in saying they wouldn't tongue flick, because they have no relationship to animals who tongue flick, and no reason to believe they may have.  It's pure imagination.

You may as well argue that dinosaurs wore top hats, because there's no evidence that they *didn't* wear top hats.&&Apparently new evidence has just recently come to light on that very subject. Seems their tongues were most likely short and stubby like alligator tongues.

>I wonder if there's evidence from the fossils of tongue structure. 

yes, muscle attachment points.&&[I found footage of that paleontologist's reaction to being fired.](https://imgur.com/vbrwA26)&&That's the core to Jurassic Park. *These aren't real dinosaurs.* They're frankensteined with other animals' DNA. That's why they were able to change gender and breed despite being denied the Y chromosome. The ""dinosaurs"" are cool, but the story of Jurassic Park is man's hubris in believing they can create and control nature, not the scientific accuracy of the dinosaurs.&&Gregory S Paul tried to recategorise some dinosaurs around the time Michael Crichton was writing Jurassic Park. One of those changes was putting Deinonychus as a species of Velociraptor due to the similarities in the skeletons. Obviously most other scientists disagreed, and this change wasn’t made official, but Crichton was a big fan of the book Paul wrote on the subject, so much so he listed Paul as one of the people who inspired his vision for dinosaurs portrayed in the book. 

&&Well there is the theory that the ""dinosaurs"" in Jurassic Park were not cloned from dinosaur blood found in prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber, that was just a PR story from the park. Instead they were genetically engineered from frog DNA 100% and the scientists designed them to be as thrilling as possible for business reasons. &&Nah, it's really distracting and silly. Makes me chuckle a bit actually. Imagine if a crocodile did that. Think of how goofy that would be!&&It was more than just early on, it actually made a fairly late stage of production before a tech firm reached out to Spielberg's company with some experimental footage. It was the fluidity of the motion that caused the switch rather than any improvement on lifelikeness.

Think of all the extra cast and crew that would be hanging around getting paid while they experiment. A small storyboard and stop motion team could probably previs most of the movie for the cost of fully shooting a scene or two. It would take time of course but the problems solved in the process would be worth it.

You might notice that pre-vis increased in quality over time. That's because modern pre-vis work is done with purpose-built tools to rapidly animate using stock models. It is also done primarily for FX-heavy shots and highy dynamic action scenes. In 1992-1993, when Jurassic Park was in production, they would have done normal storyboarding, then recorded the storyboards on cheap film, a process called ""Animatics"". This way, when you have a storyboard showing a blocky arrow pointing up, you can move the camera up that same way over the story board to get a nice-looking result. 

Pre-vis was sometimes done with dolls, too, but again, mainly for shots that are especially logistically complex. The speeder-bike scene in ROTJ was done with miniatures first, for example. 

That being said, there actually was a bit of digital pre-vis done for Jurassic Park, though only for individual shots, not whole sequences. They used an application called Lightwave 3D.

It wasn't until Mission Impossible in 1995/1996 that a whole sequence was pre-vised digitally. 

&&I actually loved Lex in the book because she behaved so realistically for her age being in that situation. It added such a heightened sense of danger for the adults who had to take care of her.

Tim kinda felt like a Mary Sue by comparison.

I love the movie iterations of them though, it’s some of the best kid acting of its generation imo.&&The one scene that takes me out of the film due to the CGI not being great is the T-Rex attack on the flocking Gallimimus.  It just doesn't look like the Rex has any sort of grip on the one it has in its mouth.  It's like the Rex as no teeth and has lubed up its gums before attacking as the Gallimimus is slipping everywhere as it's being shaken.&&
The CGI works really well because CGI is really good at slick textures such as scales in the rain at night compared to, say, a human or animals with fur&&Literally unwatchable now&&Hey, did you know that the drop where the T-Rex shoves the car down during its introduction scene just magically appears? Before that everything is ground level, like the part with the goat cage and where the T-Rex breaks through the fence. Then poof, giant abyss out of nowhere. The movie is full of inconsistencies. Doesn't make it any less fun though :)

Oh and when the Raptor tries to open the door to the control room where the kids use the Unix system, you can also see human hands handling the Raptor claws if you look closely. &&Damn, even revived prehistoric beasts are not safe from Harvey Weinstein&&Someone shut the fence off in the rain.&&Well...they are clones.&&Never heard of him. Sounds like a talented young fella though.&&Hehehe.  Yeah, I agree. There is no watching it too many times. &&Hey Alan, if you wanted to scare the OP, you could have pulled a gun on him, you know.&&This leaves out the part about Velociraptors being the size of a turkey.

It's actually interesting how it all turned out. There was a dinosaur Deinonychus which was mostly like the velociraptor in the movie which they actually modeled them off, but Chiton kept the name Veliciraptor because no joke 'it sounded better'. So they ended up making the movie and after it was released a new dinosaur was discovered 'Utah raptor' which was pretty much exactly like the dinosaurs in the movie, so they made it before it was discovered. Of course they all differ in that they had scales instead of feathers but at the time this wasn't really known. Knowledge of dinosaurs shifted dramatically in the 90s and even right up till today.&&Please let this be a new copypasta.&&Well now i have to watch the movie!  Thanks a lot!&&I am sooooooo happy that we do not have to live alongside dinosaurs. &&> And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the other two 'raptors you didn't even know were there.

Clever girl.&&Once I learned that fact suddenly every old theropod depiction looks really weird to me.

They're therapods. 

the ""bird""/""non-avian"" line is a bit blurry and arbitrary. there are legitimate arguments that archaeopteryx is a basal dromeosaur (it has a hyperextensible second toe, non-reversed hallux), which would have the effect as classifying all dromeosaurs as birds, including velociraptor and deinonychus (the one in jurassic park) as flightless birds.

velociraptor had an ulnar ridge and quill barbs, so it had wings. its ancestors were like microraptor, and probably capable of flight.

they're only very subtly different from the things we currently call birds, like archaeopteryx.&&>	These things aren’t birds.

They're more like, six foot turkeys. &&The dinosaurs depicted on screen weren't actually ""velociraptors"" at all, they were more closely modeled after ~~Dromaeosaurids~~ [Deinonychus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus). Michael Crichton just called them ""velociraptors"" because he thought it sounded more dramatic.

edit: Accidentally linked the Family rather than the genus/species&&I fucking love dinosaurs.&&But they had feathers right?&&Birds are literally therepods. &&Birds are a type of theropod though&&I mean, cladistically, if birds are descendants of therapods, they are therapods.&&Bakker also wrote a book from the perspective of a Utah raptor trying to get back to her eggs during the extinction. I think that was the general premise. I feel like I’m the only person on the planet who read it, but it was amazing for my 11 year old dinosaur obsessed brain. &&Perfect death :). The paleontologist was known for his theories and studies of the t-rex, and iirc he could be abrasive as well. &&When I was around 10 and really into dinosaurs I called Bakker, at home, and talked to him for an hour. 

Why he didn't hang up in me is a mystery. &&Wasn't Bakker mentioned in JPI as well?

ETA: [Size comparisons of Dromaeosaurs vs human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus#/media/File:Dromaeosaurs.png)  
u/Tearakan is correct that the movie versions are most closely sized with Utahraptor. Also, considering Grant was excavating in Montana badlands and the only 2 species of Velociraptor were both discovered in Mongolia.., he more appropriately would have been excavating a Utahraptor or Deinonychus. &&And yeah the whole feathers thing now too.&&Do you mean discovered in popular culture? I knew about Deinonychus as a kid in the 80s. 

As far as I know it was first discovered in the 1930s.

It's funny to think that we now know these and velociraptors almost certainly had feathers!&&You mean the Utahraptor; Deinonychus were known of for decades before this movie and are the size of a large goose.&&The Jurassic Park velociraptor was based off of Deinonychus, Utahraptor wasn't discovered until after production had already begun on the movie &&Well the Utahraptor is actually 3 feet bigger (10 feet in total) than the raptors in the movie. While the remains were discovered before the first movie’s release, it wasn’t officially announced until after the movie.&&That's super interesting. When I was a kid the understanding was that T-rex's arms were almost useless, bordering on vestigial. So much has changed, hopefully my kid will be super in to dinosaurs like I was and she can teach me all about it. &&What's the current thinking on what t. Rex used its arms for?

Check out the making of the first movie online, its wonderful.&&You can tell when they don't do that by watching a movie with shitty CGI.&&Are these guys...auto...rotica?&&What about normal 2D storyboards?&&That one shot after the ladle hits the floor- the raptor turning his head, and then the *other* raptor popping his head into frame. *Magnifique*&&That’s because you were. 

*Jurassic Park* was written by a skilled author at the peak of his game. The movie was made by a Mt. Rushmore director, if not the GOAT, also at the peak of his game. The movie itself is the focus, not a given actor or actress. 

*Jurassic World* and its sequels are a cash-in by studio hacks, written and directed by no-names, to be a Chris Pratt (tm) vehicle. 

It’s not a subtle difference. &&Could you see the dinosaurs often enough to notice they were fake? They were always in super dark spots or super spotlighted cages. The only time I could see the Indoraptor clearly was when it was on the roof. &&I'm about to go see it lol. I look forward to seeing a crappy dinosaur thriller. I just wish they'd try to make a meaningful film one of these days. Hopefully they remember that character is important with the next installment. 

I want that JW control room nerdy couple to be the heroes in the next one. Regular people caught up in the mad science of powerful elites faced with the difficult decision of sacrificing their comfortable lives to stop a great unethical event. It's a new story. JP was about the opposite, sort of. Saving/finding family in spite of powerful elites. The flipside would be really cool with modern CGI and would be very topical because our society is too damn complacent. 

Wah.&&I think that's unfair. I mean, yes, Jurassic Park is a masterpiece and JWFK is rather dumb. But the camera work and lighting was phenomenal. For instance, the baryonyx appearing in the tunnel, seen only by her silhouette as she's briefly backlit by falling lava. Really effective, haunting imagery, even if the story around it is dumb as shit.&&A good amount of emotional work is done by the camerawork. For instance, the raptors always have the high position in the frame, this gives them dominance, and the children have to hide along the bottom of the same frame. 
That dominance gives the raptors the same caliber of presence, threat, and intelligent malice that a horror movie would usually give a murderer dialogue to attain.

By framing the raptors in the top of every scene they share with the children, we get scale, and an idea of dominance. The zoom at the end is similar to how we would see a character become determined after being fooled, in a traditional film. 
The camera pushing in on the raptor at the end projects the same feeling we already expect from that action, but on to the raptor, giving the raptor more agency, and making the raptor seem like an active, intelligent, actor in the hunt of the children. Not just an animal that wildly throws itself at prey. 

EDIT: not a zoom, tracking.&&When one raptor nips at the other the frame lets them have their moment like they were people in a shot together. They have close-ups like the human characters at appropriate times. When one slips and slides on the ice, she's given the same kind of focus and vulnerability as Tim. And my favorite is the last close up where she's leering at the kids. Basically the camera tells me she's thinking and not just being a spooky monster for the camera. 

Contrast this to Jurassic World, which needs to throw in our faces in the script and the plot that the dinosaurs are best buddies with Owen lol. They use action hero slow-mo and bro nods instead of using subtle blocking and camera work to show that while keeping the animal behavior. Does that male more sense?&&For one thing they are almost always, to some degree, looking into the camera, though never directly at it. It makes you, the viewer, feel hunted. Even in the cuts when they are ostensibly in the background, the focus is on them. Having just watched the final version again quick, in the static camera shots where Lex and Tim are in the foreground, the kids are still but the Velociraptors are moving, in the static camera shots where Lex and Tim are moving, the kids are generally in the background or the bottom edge. This gives the Velocirapors sentience. 

As a related thing, the composition is such that their eyes, not theirs claws, are the focus. There is, of course, one notable, and extremely effective pair of exceptions to this, but it actually adds to the sense of intelligence. The claw-clicking is a fidget, like clicking a pen, which is not a mannerism associated with a bear or tiger, for instance. The focus on this very human action makes them seem more sentient.

The camera moves are synced in response to *their* actions, and more importantly their “thoughts,” not generally Lex and Tim’s. My favorite example is the scene where the raptor is sniffing the spoon, and as she looks up, the camera fluidly moves towards Tim. The raptor is *reasoning out* what is going on, and where the prey must be, and the camera is emphasizing that putting 2+2 together just as surely as the fantastic animation work is.

Seriously, go watch it with a conscious emphasis on what the camera is getting you to feel. It’s a fun exercise. I have seen this scene at least a dozen times, and haven’t seen the movie in a few years, but it still makes me tense up.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=dnRxQ3dcaQk&&Oh, thanks stranger :) 

I just know it made me feel like I was watching a character instead of monster.&&Blocking is a theater/stage term for how and where you stand in a scene. In film it's how the scene is staged for the frame of the camera. 

Here is a [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_\(stage\)) article on it. &&It’s basically an actors interaction with the set. It includes where they move from one spot to the next.  When to sit where. When to look at this person or that person. Get in the car. Walk to this mark. Pet the dog. With CGI, like the dinosaurs, the actors have to look and interact with things that aren’t there yet and are added in post productions. OP is commenting on how well the actors did at convincing us the dinosaurs were there when they couldn’t even see them. 

Edit* just saw someone already answered. Well, I’m leaving it. Cheers Mate&&I guess I meant like I keep thinking the kids are gonna get eaten&&I never picked up on that before but seems to check out. &&Fuck me. I've watched this movie countless times and never once connected those dots. &&I always thought that since the power was out the contents of the freezer had started melting, however that would take much too long in a commercial kitchen's walk-in freezer.

I remember almost all aspects of that day when I saw that movie as it was one of the very few good memories I have of my father and I. 

Bonus story. Went to see Jurassic world with a girl I had been dating only a few months and ended up losing my shit and turning into a blubery mess as soon as the main score from the first movie... &&That useless dude can't just do anything right&&Yes, but also: https://goo.gl/images/u1WKXd&&Recent movies? Relatively. We're all getting older! Matrix Reloaded and LOTR Return of the King were both released in 2003. &&Yeah I liked that aspect. It was realistic for her age, but in movie form it might have been a little grating. I'm doing the audio book version of Jurassic Park and the narrator does a really good impression of her so it got slightly annoying towards the end of the book. I think she's less irritating if you were to read it though. Tim was definitely a Mary Sue and was even more competent than some of the adults.


Movie versions of Tim & Lex are pretty much the standard of good kid actors in those types of movies. They're so good&&the way lex wiggles that jello&&Yeah, I can't think of any other decent child acting in a long time.  Part of that seems to be the writing for the children though, like how Dakato Fanning's character in War of the Worlds literally did nothing but scream and that's all she was written for.  Kids don't have the experience to make up for shitty writing.&&90s child actors were terrible... these kids were great for their roles in the movie&&It just means there was a hidden antagonist this whole time.

I don't fully agree with this explanation, but some people like it.&&The giant abyss always annoyed me, but damn I still love that film.&&Oh and the pretty well known one where the ""Live video"" of the guy on the docks during the storm is blatantly just a recorded video complete with progress bar.&&You monster!&&I admit it's kinda eerie&&True...but they could have had her scarred or rougher in appearance(as already mentioned) or physically a bit larger as the nickname suggests.&&I don't like OPs - they're noisy, they're expensive, they smell... &&And uh... Here I am..... Commenting to myself...&&I wonder if Jurassic Park could have it's own style of /r/prequelmemes without feeling too forced. &&OP? *Everyone&&>There was a dinosaur Deinonychus which was mostly like the velociraptor in the movie which they actually modeled them off, but Chiton kept the name Veliciraptor because no joke 'it sounded better'. 

Not quite correct.  

Go to the wiki page for Deinonychus and you'll see one of the synonyms for the species is Velociraptor Antirrhopus with a listed source for the name being paleontologist Gregory Paul's 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World.  At the time there was some debate over which clade of dinosaurs Deinonychus belonged to with some arguing that it was a possible species of Veliciraptor, hence the name change by Paul for the book.

One of the main references of information Crichton used for writing the novel of Jurassic Park was Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the earliest editions of which have the species listed as Velociraptor Antirrhopus.  Crichton new of the name debate and went with the  Velociraptor variant 'because it sounded better'.  He didn't just pick the name of a completely different species for how it sounded.&&In the book, the animal was named ""Velociraptor Antirrhopus"", which is an allusion to the recently discovered North American Deinonychus Antirrhopus. The Velociraptor in the Jurassic Park series was never the Mongolian Velociraptor. 

Utahraptor would have been too bloody big to make any sense. The Jurassic Park Velociraptors were ~300 lbs. Utahraptor was a very large animal which pushed a ton in weight.&&The feathers thing is actually mentioned in the book. It’s been a theory for ages, but was confirmed about the time Jurassic Park was written. However, we don’t know if they were completely feathered or partially. Crichton was actually very meticulous in his research as far as the book went. If you haven’t read it, it’s worlds different from the movie. Both are great though.&&They were actually only the size of a turkey? I just assumed they were the same size as the movie. &&I always loved Deinonychus as a kid.  There's a dinosaur National Geographic from around 1980 I read as a kid with a double page spread of the ol' Deiny doing a skid-turn.  Another awesome multi-page fold out was a comparison of lots of different raptors (including the comparatively teeny-tiny veloci-).

When JP came out, despite being a screaming fan boy who gripped the cinema seats in white-knuckled excitement/terror at the T-rex paddock, I kept screaming ""that's no velociraptor!  that's a goddamn deiny!""

People thought I was just stupid and saying a cute ""diny,"" like saying ""dino.""  No, damnit! DEINonYchus you Phillistines!&&There’s actually a pretty good canon explanation which is that Hammond didn’t really care about realistic dinosaurs, he wanted cool theme park attractions, so he instructed the genetic scientists to make them bigger and scarier-looking. This also explains why they don’t have feathers; at that time the scientists would not have known that, so they wouldn’t have included it in the clones.

So basically none of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are authentic by design, they are man-made chimeras that are intended to closely resemble dinosaurs.&&Please let this be a new copypasta.&&https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/characters/nm0381035&&They're all doing a Deadpool.&&Pronate?

They weren’t really modeled after a specific one, but there was discovered around the time of the movie a genus called Utahraptor that was actually fairly accurate to what the movie depicted.

Velociraptor was about the size of a medium sized dog.&&It says right there that the informal name IS velociraptor

edit:  Thx /u/Daveed84  TIL&&Very close. Chrichton didn’t ass-pull the name, he had some scientific support, that didn’t last. 

As he was writing the book, deinonychus had just been discovered, and at the time was being called velociraptor. Then science said ‘nevermind’ but the book was already published!

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/you-say-velociraptor-i-say-deinonychus-33789870/

Further proof that we are really just looking at deinonychuses is the fact that Grant and Saddler are excavating one in MT in the beginning of the book. Velociraptors were found in Mongolia.&&I love fucking dinosaurs.&&Oh man, Raptor Red, I loved that book!  

  
IIRC, it wasn't her looking for her eggs, but rather, 'The life and times of a Utahraptor'. 'Red' is the main character raptor!  

    
I think I remeber the base story, Her mate gets killed, Red gets all depressed, then a flood happens and she finds her sister and her sisters hatchlings, they go about for a while, I can't remember why, but they hit up the ocean, and somebody gets wrecked by a dino-sea-monster, then a whiptail broncosaur, then Red gets boned by some male that got with the group, and the end is happy days mama Red.   

I also vaugely remember a side-story thing with a flying dino, like an albino pterodactyl, that follows and watches them from above, he might have even been the 'narrator'.    
  

They should make a movie on that book, I'd watch it.&&Raptor Red! I read it multiple times as a kid.&&holy crap! I read that book 20 times when I was a boy, and literally have not heard it mentioned or seen anything about it since.&&I read that as well!&&I just thought freaking out about a snake when there was a T-Rex right there kinda seemed dumb.&&Seems petty.

https://youtu.be/772GiBXnWoQ&&I *almost* Googled that.&&Dinosaurs are reptiles, and so are lizards, but lizards and dinosaurs branches off from each other in the Triassic. Since birds come from a dinosaur lineage, this technically makes birds reptiles! Innit cool?&&They are related to reptiles, but much more distantly than most people think. Dinosaurs are very much their ""own"" group that did descend from reptiles but split off from them and became quite different in many ways. Wether they are ""true reptiles"" or not becomes a complicated discussion about taxonomy, but they are *not* that closely related to most reptiles (like lizards and snakes for example). 

Dinosaurs are most closely related to crocodiles and birds, specifically. And interestingly, pterodactyls are *not* dinosaurs but they *are* reptiles! &&Their descendants are birds. Not reptiles.&&Everything that is or ever has been alive is related. You're related to the sallad you ate last week.&&Correct. They were Deinonychus. 

Crichton renamed Deinonychus (an American dinosaur) in the novel to Velociraptor with his reason being that he felt that the name was ""more dramatic"".

Edit: sorry, just saw you were the same person I replied to before. Crichton essentially Ctrl+F’ed Deinonychus and replaced it with Velociraptor when the book was finished. &&""I can make smooth dinosaur movement... for money.""&&Along with Phil Tippett, ILM co-developed the Go-Motion technology slated to be used in the film.   One of the ILM VFX artists working on the technology for the film was multi Academy award winning artist Dennis Muren who had worked with Spielberg numerous times before.  It was him that suggested over the phone to Spielberg that he might have a way of doing the dinosaurs digitally.&&The thing is it's not as simple as that, CG is just a paintbrush, but you still have to be a good artist to use it well. Loads of stop motion and practical affects people went on to work in CG for TV and movies becsuse their artistic ability transfered over, and they could do things better than newbies once they learned how to use the software, same thing with 2d animators at places like Disney who transferred to 3d animation and to games development and things like that. Some were put out of a career sure, but a lot just went to pixar to make toy story and so on and to companies that specialise in CG effects&&To be fair, they were *still* using stop motion animation techniques when they switched to doing CGI animation. The 
""dinosaur input device"" was pretty much just a stop motion armature with sensors on it, hooked up to the computer. Even though it wasn't employed for every single shot, some of the biggest moments in the film were animated that way, like the main road attack and raptors in the kitchen scenes. &&> Stop motion guy's words upon seeing the CGI footage og Gallimimus running ""I think I'm extinct""

If I'm remembering the story right, it was Spielberg who jokingly told Phil Tippet that he was out of a job, and Tippet responded ""Don't you mean extinct?"" which Spielberg loved so much he wrote the line into the movie.
&&Most of the animatronics are in very close up shots where you can't see the whole animal, and it was this seamless blending between the robot shots and CGI that really sold it and continues to sell it decades later. Editing gets a huge amount of credit for JP's effects still looking so, so good so many years later.

A bunch of shots all close together —

T-rex claw tugging on fence, robotic/prop

T-rex stomping out of enclosure, CGI

Close-up of T-rex eye, roaring, etc, robotic/prop

T-rex foot stomping down, robotic/prop

T-rex chasing the car, chasing Ian Malcolm, eating the lawyer, etc, all CGI&&All of which gave me the impression the budget had been slashed halfway through production forcing everyone to come together to make a fucking bottle episode Jurassic World movie. Same characters, same stakes, just shrunk down by 75%: majority of the action taking place in one location (a mansion!), limited core cast, limited shared screen time of said core cast, Speilberg-shootung-Jaws amounts of creatures budget, and only enough left over for extras that they had to be used in the same scene to give the illusion of scope.

Some do. 

FTFY. &&Baby OPs smell.&&r/holdontoyourmemes&&[deleted]&&Afraid it wasn't, at least not in the edition that I've got on my Kindle. Grant discusses the fact that Deinonychus has, in the book's universe, been reclassified as a Velociraptor species but the animals in the park are referred to on more than one occasion as V. mongoliensis and the DNA sample is mentioned as having come from amber found in China.&&I think they've found a full skeleton  or two of a small species of raptor preserved in stone that had shown full feathers over the entire body. That doesn't speak for the larger cousins though. I think I read most palentoligest are on the same page that many of those small feathered Raptors could indeed fly or were capable of gliding with all four limbs.

Edit: source - microraptor - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microraptor&&I think it goes beyond that too. If I remember correctly, it was mentioned that when they made the dinosaurs that they took some artistic license to make them more like what people expect instead of completely accurate, and feathers might've been a part of that? They were making a zoo in the end and they wanted to make stuff that would amaze the visitors and feathers didn't fit with the classic idea of big deadly lizards. &&Yeah the real Velociraptors are the size of a turkey. The JP Raptors were in between Deinonychus and Utahraptor. &&Dad?&&I gotcha. I thought inward was as in, facing towards their body. Thanks!&&Check-mate, Dr Grant!&&Hallowed be their bones...amen&&Life uh.....finds a way.&&You meant hollow not hallow.&&""I should proofread my post next time.""&&that's definitely the other possible way to look at it.&&>Why would the bigger ones have wings 

because their ancestors did.

>Their arms are fully functional and nothing like ostrich or other flightless bird 

or other modern flying birds. they, and most cretaceous birds and closely related non-avian theropods have distinct digits and claws. modern birds develop those digits as embryos, but they fuse into a carpometacarpus before they hatch (except the hoatzin).

they were probably able to generate *some* lift, like say chickens. not exactly flight capable for any real distance, but not exactly stuck to the ground either.

>Did they evolve down from a flying version? 

probably! archaeopteryx probably could fly to a much greater extent, as could microraptor, both of which are closely related to whatever is ancestral to velociraptor.&&[Have you never seen a goose?](https://assets.rbl.ms/10341653/980x.jpg) &&early ones didn't!&&no, they were too large for their breastbone/wing size. but their ancestors probably could.

my favorite theory is a take on ""assisted incline running"" hypothesis, that they used small bursts of lift to stabilize themselves as they jumped into their preys' faces, and used the control to precisely attack the jugular with their sickle claws.

we have a fossil of one doing exactly this. their toes/claws were not strong enough for the safer, less precise ""gut slash"" they described in jurassic park.&&I love these charts with nice art. Thanks for linking!&&Dino’s being giant ass terror birds is disturbing especially when you watch chickens chasing after and ripping a mouse to shreds. I just multiply that to the size of these and add teeth. Actual “terror birds” are scary enough.&&I always get confused. Why do they have feathers o their arms like wings. Would they have evolved from a smaller animal that used those wings to fly at one point? &&I don’t understand why the feather look everyone goes with gives them wings 

Why would they have wings - their arms are fully functional for grabbing and look nothing like ostrich arms &&Gah that just makes me want a little dog-sized dinosaur as a pet.&&Yeah, I screwed up and linked the wrong article, thanks for the heads up.&&Here's the thing...&&Lickalottapuss is my favorite.&&It was a coral snake and their bites can be fatal to humans. A little silly, but not an unwarranted freakout.&&High stress situations do not often result in effective responses.&&I know that every time *I* see a venomous snake, my liminal brain is in full control, and there isn’t even a hint of an irrational fight or flight response.

I’m sure I’d be even *more* contained if I stepped on a rattlesnake while already on edge from being stalked by a bear.&&That’s because it’s not accurate to reality, /u/TurrPhennirPhan has the actual story below&&That’s my favorite part of Jurassic World actually, when the scientist from the first film quips about how the company wanted the dinosaurs to be engineered to look cooler rather than be accurate. &&The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil and the Jazz moved to Utah where they don't allow music.&&That literally happens in the novel. The real dinosaurs were quick and agile unlike the dinosaurs from old cartoons, so they started modifying them to be slow and lumber about.&&[deleted]&&close. they changed it because crichton read greg paul's ""predatory dinosaurs of the world"" which proposes them as synonyms. since ""velociraptor"" is older, deinonychus is called by that name.&&Michael Crichton was definitely basing it on the Deinonychus, but Raptor just sounded better. 

Especially if you’ve read the first book’s first chapter where the hospital staff takes an injured InGen staff member with what appears to be bite mark from a rabid dog. He keeps saying Raptor, and the medical staff (nurse or one of the doctors can’t remember who she was) member goes on to find out what Raptor means and after another medical staff member tells her it means the bogeyman, she doesn’t believe her. The chapter ends when she finds out in the dictionary that Raptor means “Bird of Prey”. 

So it just made for a better name and a better way to start the novel.&&>Dinosaurs are reptiles

They are under the class Reptilia, yes, but their order is so far removed from modern reptiles this is just not a correct statement to make and will lead many into mistake.
It's like you're saying Humans and Platypus are the same because they are in the same class, makes no real sense.&&No, it doesn't make birds reptiles. It makes birds descended from reptiles.&&I recall reading that they were also more than likely warmblooded.&&Didn’t know they renamed it, but yes that makes more sense since the Deinonychus was much, much larger (11 ft I think?) and the film states the fossil as being 6 feet long.

Don’t get why they think renaming it makes it more fearful, personally I always liked deinonychus better.

Edit: my bad, the 6 feet they referred to in the scene was probably the height, not the length, which is accurate.&&„Gentlemen, there is a solution you’re not seeing...”&&Spielberg was a master of this. Jaws still holds up after all this time and it's even older.&&It was so freaking lame being stuck in that house for over half the movie. I kinda wonder if they shot their wad on the whole volcano explosion sequence which contains ""more dinosaurs than we've ever had in any Jurassic movie before"". Which would be kinda amusing considering how underwhelmingly staged the whole thing was.

""Bottle show"" is a good way of thinking about it. Think that term comes from Star Trek right? Where they'd just not leave the ship and do a personal drama without tonnes of effects? As far as big summer blockbuster movies go, Fallen Kingdom's second act onward is about as close you could get to that. Mainly human drama, including dumb subplots unrelated to the dinosaur problem at hand. &&My take is, blockbuster films dont always have to be bigger, because eventually it just becomes a parody (see: Fast & Furious). Fallen Kingdom started as an over the top disaster movie, but wisely shifts gears to a more intimate horror thriller. It's something different for the franchise, and it was different from what had come in the movie itself beforehand, which keeps the action from becoming stale. 

Also, they said years ago that Fallen Kingdrom would be a horror story, so the mansion sequence was probably decided way in advance and not the result of an unseen budget cut.

Fallen Kingdom also had the most dinosaurs in the franchise by far. The movie definitely has flaws, but I don't think a sense of scale is one of them. &&Maybe one day we'll find a mosquito that bit him encased in ember. We'll build a park to give people a sense of what the world was like when the Michael Chritons roamed the earth. &&I would highly recommend watching the videos by the, now dead, channel Every Frame a Painting. As well as a bunch of stuff on cinematography, or best scenes compilations by Cinefix. There’s a wealth of information on cinematography on YouTube.&&You’re right, I said zoom, I actually just was corrected by my girlfriend when she read the comment.&&Huzzah! I'm interested to see JW2 now to see the contrast. &&Pretty much. &&Want to hear something “worse”? People are talking about the 70 mm release of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Well, I saw that in the theatre the year it was released. We didn’t even have color TV in my house back then. That seems like ages ago.&&And I don't think I'll be coming back again&&Hold on to your butts because we do not grant you the rank of Master OP. &&Hello there.&&**Ellie** - ""They do not smell.""

**Alan** - Some of them smell! *Babies* smell!""

Jesus Christ people. If you're gonna correct others at least get closer to what it actually is.&&Babies do! Babies smell!&&[deleted]&&That is super interesting. I didn't even know there were different kinds. I only knew of the Velociraptor. &&HAWRAAAHAHAHA **HAHA**!!&&ALAN!&&Hallowed are the Ori. &&Hollow be thine name&&Just seems weird they’d have useless wings and fully functional arms 

I bet the image we have now is wrong. 

&&Not the mouth holy shit&&Alright, so they still used their wings? That's pretty cool!&&Feathers were used as mating or intimidation display long before they were used to fly.&&Wings did not originate for use in flight, but probably for display. Nevertheless, smaller dromaeosaurs like Microraptor in that picture probably used them to glide.

It may be that dromaeosaurs all evolved from gliding ancestors, as Microraptor is quite a primitive member of the group.&&They had quill barbs in their bones wich are the atachtment of feathers while it was alive, the style of feathers is probably wrong (it probably looked more like hair) but his ancestors did have proper feathers, so if they had feathers it could have served display or climbing purposes. Other explanation of the flight feathers is for educational purposes on linking them to birds in the eyes of the general public.&&Because they had wings. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromaeosauridae#/media/File:Microraptor_gui_holotype.png

There is no reason to assume Microraptor is an outlier, and it's not the only dromaeosaur fossil like this. Several other dromaeosaurs, while not quite this well-preserved, preserve quill knobs etc that attached feathers to the arms. &&Yeah, until it starts delivering children's body parts to you like a cat does with mice pieces.&&Chickens are close. Ive seen mine chase down lizards and pin them to the ground with their talons like a T-rex. Then they just start ripping pieces off. Kinda crazy. &&It's OK to admit you're wrong.&&How have I never heard this before&&On the other hand , a bite from a T-Rex would be fatal to humans as well.&&A Scarlet Kingsnake actually (nonvenomous) but it was no doubt used because of its similarity to a coral snake. &&That's an extra easter egg if you pay attention to it, as it's not a coral snake. Red touch black, safe for Jack.&&I'm sure it was mean't to look like a Coral snake but was actually a King snake. If you watch the scene again red will most likely be touching black.&&and the lakers left minnesota for LA which has considerably fewer lakes than 10,000&&Wu in the book proposed that, but Hammond wanted authentic, and refused to listen to Wu explaining that they weren’t real dinosaurs anyway so there as no authenticity no matter what they did, and Hammond was just insisting on marking the park more difficult to handle and more dangerous out of his own arrogance. They was one of my favorite bits of Hammond’s arrogance that didn’t translate to the movie.&&But then you'd be making a paraphyletic group, which often leads to confusion. I think it's best that we stick to monophyletic groupings, which foster a more intuitive understanding of evolutionary relationships.

Humans are lobe-finned fish. Superficial differences don't make that statement any less true. And going back to your statement about humans and platypus, yes, they are indeed the same, as far as basal mammalian traits are concerned. Obviously they are different, but all organisms are the same insofar as their most recent common ancestor has defined traits.

When it comes to the dinosaurs, I think using the ""reptile"" word here is pretty misleading. Not just for the reason you gave, but also because reptile usually just means extant diapsids and anapsids which aren't birds (which is offensively paraphyletic). This term creates all sorts issues, because crocodylians are more similar to birds and dinosaurs than any extant ""reptile.""

While I do agree with your opinion of using ""reptile,"" I think that's because the word is misleading in general, not because dinosaurs are less similar to them.&&Now I want to watch Jurassic Park&&Welcome... to Jurassrick Park&&I mean, he just doesn't leave until it looks legit. It's not like he's the one painting the animatronics. He's just the one who says, 
""nope not good enough yet"".&&This is horror movie making 101 though - you never show your creature too much, and almost never show the whole thing, because they usually look goofy.

You almost never see the entire xenomorph in the Alien movies (at least 1 and 2) because the alien looks like a dude in a rubber suit. There's some deleted scene footage that shows this and it looks goofy as hell. Even the iconic scene where the xenomorph comes out of the water behind Newt, you can clearly see it's a string pulling up the tail.&&Your girlfriend is a keeper&&Ohhh nooooooo!!!!&&Execute order 66

*ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word! Ah ah ah! Ah ah ah!*&&I've never heard deinonychus called velociraptor in any other context than in Jurassic Park. The first remains were discovered in the 1930s and while it was informally known by other names (none of them velociraptor), it was officially was named deinonychus in 1969, well before Jurassic Park was written. The story of the discovery of deinonychus is rather interesting and an overview can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor#History_of_discovery)&&No it wasn't. It was just [Michael Crichton](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/you-say-velociraptor-i-say-deinonychus-33789870/) that insisted to use that wrong taxonomy.&&There's like a shitload if you add up all of the [Dromaeosaurids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromaeosauridae?wprov=sfla1), and they have pretty similar relatives called [troodontids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodontidae?wprov=sfla1). Most are somewhere between a little smaller than Velociraptor to a little bigger than Deinonychus, but there's a couple that are Utahraptor size and a little bigger. 

There are literally hundreds of species of dinosaur out there, it's pretty crazy.&&[HAWRAAAHAHAHA **HAHA**!!: The Remix](https://youtu.be/wJelEXaPhJ8)
&&Hahahahahah omfg my fucking sides. &&You'll have to excuse Dr. Malcom....&&Wait a minute, that not Alan at all is it? That's Steve.

STEVE! STEVE!!&&To build on what /u/arachnophilia was saying, there are tons of other uses for wings. For example, some predatory birds flap while on the ground to stabilize themselves on top of and aid in attacking their pretty. Many birds use their wings for display while wooing a mate or in other scenarios. Chicks of one bird species use their partially-developed wings to help them run down steep slopes. 

Wings almost certainly evolved for other purposes rather than flight, because until the wings and muscles are big enough for flying they'd be mostly useless for flying.

We have preserved [wing feathers](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11775/figures/1) and quill barbs in several dinosaurs, some of which are complete skeletons, so we know there are dinosaurs that looked pretty close to the image we have now.&&they weren't useless! they just couldn't use them for sustained powered flight.&&That looks like something nightmares are made of&&it's not actually known, but that's one of several ideas. even modern ostriches still use their wings, though.&&I am so tired of this Anti-T-Rex propaganda bullshit.

How do we know it's ""fatal to humans""?

How many humans do you know who have been eaten by T-Rexi? None.

How many recorded cases do we have of T-Rexi eating humans in the last 10,000 years? Absolutely none.

Never give up.&&Rewatched this last year expecting it to be far worse than my memory built it up to be. But, actually, it's held up really well as a cult classic that I can still enjoy.

Also, I love that Dracula takes a break from his plan to plan to blow up the boys Clubhouse, knowing they're not there, just to be a dick!  &&Me neither actually.....although the dvd is remastered as best can be for dvd but I love the movie regardless.&&Now draw wolfmans nards &&For its time period I still kinda get impressed with the actual affects.

wonderful song by Mega Ran that I've loved for years about this! &&I have a shirt that says that lol. prized possession.&&While I agree that's the best line in the movie, I still think Rudy's entrance is the the most fly entrance of any character in cinematic history: https://youtu.be/1It93tPLH9k

Consider my mind blown fellow Monster Squad internet fan. &&OK speaking of unexpected actors playing werewolves: The [serial killer/werewolf Eddie Quist in *The Howling*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uO0YHXWUNo) is played by Robert Picardo, the EMH from *Star Trek: Voyager*.&&The pilot in the beginning plays Richie Aprile in The Sopranos.

That burn was harsh!&&He somehow escaped from /r/leagueoflegends and got loose into the wild. I've called animal control and they should have him back home soon.&&For a second there I thought you said remake and my wolfman nards went up to my throat.&&Nah, I hope it remains in cult status forever. It was one of my favorite movies growing up - would for it to get the credit we all know it deserves lol&&I still to this day think he's one of the best Dracula's I've seen. In fact I think all the monsters played their parts great, but he definitely stood out.&&This was a movie that was in my brain for a long time but had no idea what it was called. I was so glad when one of my roommates realize what I was talking about and we watch the whole thing. The only part I remember was when they open the closet so there's nothing to be scared but there is a monster in there. That line from Dracula I had no idea was in the movie and was so funny&&He absolutely is the best Dracula.

Also, no ""little"" in that line. &&Didn't this version of Dracula win some award? Let me see if I can find it.

I found it was #30 in Wizard top 100, which is a cool compliment from the cult community, but I can't find the other because stupid work. Or maybe there is no other and I gave the award in a dream, who knows&&And the fact that Phoebe the Feeb's reaction to him in that moment is very real. They didn't tell the actress about the teeth or anything when he grabs her face. &&I miss the 80s.

Monster Squad is obviously a kids movie, however it had cussing in it, smoking, inappropriate shit all around.  A movie made before everyone got all sensitive and shit.

I mean Frankenstein's Monster even took a stalkie of that girl changing her bra. That shit would never be made today.

I just have a keychain, lol. &&I'm a little late to this party but I have [the drawing of the amulet from the diary](https://imgur.com/a/xENeESA) tattoo :D&&Cause in monster squad they actually killed people. Goonies they just got chattery teeth on their nards.&&Goonies was super sanitized for maximum family friendliness.

Feels nice to see someone with a similar opinion.&&The bit where they’re making weapons was cool as fuck when I was 8&&Didn't they both have different maturity ratings though?

Such a classic!&&[Monster Squad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560) is movie similar to the Goonies, but instead of pirates, it's classic movie monsters.

It's fantastic &&hehe&&I rewatched it a few years back. Still holds up very well. It was pretty serious for a kid's movie and not really silly at all.

""He's at the gym.""&&That's a helluva mohawk&&https://imgur.com/p2uwp1x&&Dolph Lundgren is returning as Ivan Drago, the man who killed Creed's father. His son, Viktor Drago, will be the main antagonist.&&Creed II aka Rocky VIII

I have to admit, it's a brilliant way to keep a series going *and* less prone to prejudices/criticism about dragging it out.&&Super pumped for this, please let it be on the same level as at least Rocky II. I don’t expect it to match Creed since it’s not Coogler, but please be good.

At the end of the day though, as long as it isn’t Rocky V levels I’ll be happy.

I loved how it popped up fighter statistics like a video game mid shot which I thought was simple but very cool.&&I need to watch Creed.&&*breaks retainer*&&I'm a straight male but God damn that physique is on point. &&First trailer debuts tomorrow!&&So stoked for this! My husband forced me to watch Rocky a few years ago and I wasn’t enthused since I’m not a huge sports movie gal. I fucking loved it and watched all of them, and went to see Creed opening night! Rocky is one of the genuine nicest characters in any movie of all time! He never has anything bad to say about anyone. You can’t not love him. Creed was a breath of fresh air and still fit wonderfully in the Rocky universe. &&Creed II: Wallace's revenge&&Wait, this isn't The Office...&&I'm so excited for this. 

My Dad and I, while we're friendly towards each other, don't really have any shared interests. It's kind of hard. We love each other sure, but we just don't really like anything the other one is into.

With the 1 exception that is Rocky.

My favorite stories of my Dad are when I was still in grade school. I always had to be in bed by a certain time. One night it was real late (for a kid who had school the next day) and I got up to go get something to drink from the fridge. I walked into the kitchen but I saw that there was light and noise coming from the living room. I walked in to see what was up and my Dad was there watching the 1st Rocky movie. It had pretty much just started. My Dad saw me, and I was sure he was going to tell me to get back in bed. But he didn't. Out of character for my Dad, he asked me if I wanted to stay up and watch this movie with him (I had never seen it up until this point in my life). We stay up so late watching Rocky. He was explaining boxing to me and we were cheering as Rocky won and yelling when he was getting beaten. 

From that moment on, anytime there was a Rocky marathon on TV we'd watch it together. It was our thing. 

As an adult now who doesn't live with my parents anymore, it's harder to see him as much. We're still in the same city, but we've all got our own things going on. Work, trips, etc.

But I took my Dad to go see the 1st one in the theater and we both had a blast. It felt like I was a kid again. Sitting in his recliner with him again watching Rocky.

I just sent him a text with this poster and told him we'd definitely be going to this on Thanksgiving weekend! &&[deleted]&&We're gonna need a stronger retainer.&&Creed was so good. I really hope they don’t spoil the series with this sequel. I’ve been concerned as soon as I found out that Ivan’s son was going to be the antagonist, as much as I love all the Rocky films, they got just a tad cheesy as they went on and I pray this doesn’t go the same way. The rawness made the first one as good as it is  &&Totally cheated out of the Oscars.&&I'm not gay but come on Look at him.&&Let’s go!&&I watched them film part of this a few weeks ago.

Creed's story and motivation are no less interesting than Balboa's in parts I and II.&&Crap.  I missed Adrian's Revenge&&YOU! You are the most contextually aligned comment for me to tell my story!  

Ok so I had heard about Creed, and I kind of recalled creed being a boxer. I thought it was a biopic  / life story / sport movie about an actual real life boxer named Creed.  

So the movie comes out on DVD and thus also on demand.  

I am in the mood for a good biography / sport movie. So I rent it and away I go.  

20-30 minutes in maybe sooner, I forget... It shows him walking down a street.... And then there is Rocky's bar.. I LOSE MY FUCKING SHIT as I realize this is not some biography! THIS IS A FUCKING ROCKY MOVIE!!!  

I had to pause as I began a 40 minute geek out session, and inform all 6 of my kids, my wife, text 6 friends, and squeeee at the dogs in excitement!  

40 minutes later, I finally sit back down to watch...   

THAT moment was the greatest twist in movie history for me.. And it was not meant to be a twist, it was just dumb luck that i never knew anything about the movie.  

That is all.&&Weird Al's ""Theme to Rocky VIII"" better make it's way into this movie... Hahahahaha.&&How did I miss out on Rocky VII: Adrian’s Revenge??&&having a really good story and an actor that actually LOOKS like he he's a legit boxer really helps too.&&This guy knows about American underdog stories &&We just might...isn't he going up against Drago's son?



""Living In America"" the Childish Gambino remix.&&Aw man it’s not Coogler? That kinda sucks. I wanted this to be his baby.&&Wait you trying to say creed is better than rocky 2?&&""You're telling me you're gay too?""

""Nah, I'm just feelin' it""&&""I invested too much time into this body for like 3 movies. I'm gonna make all the movies I can with it.""&&He was 182 pounds when Creed was filmed (his character of Adonis was 175 pounds in the movie). He reportedly bulked to 194 pounds and then lost 10 pounds to 184 for Black Panther. 

What is interesting is that in the first movie his first fight was against a boxer played by Gabriel Rosado who is a middleweight. He then fought a boxer played by Tony Bellew, who has been a light heavvyweight, cruiserweight and heavyweight throughout his career. The weight limit for cruiserweight divisions is 200 pounds. 

Florian Muntenau, who plays Drago's son is 235-245 pounds. This means that story-wise Adonis Creed would have to go up at the very least one weight division in order to fight him.&&So do you!&&""Throw the damn towel""&&Well, he is playing a man named Adonis.&&*My* museum. And by that I mean my vagina.&&His face does too! He's ridiculously cute!&&Rian Johnson ain’t directing this one &&And if they do, I really hope they treat his death with the respect he deserves and give him a good sendoff.

It's going to be really hard to write a death scene for such a legendary character in movie history like Rocky.&&Yeah this is what I'm afraid of, given what was going on in Creed.

Cinematography was pretty good and even though at the end of the day it’s still a rocky movie it’s a refreshing take that caught me off guard &&Bro. Fucking watch it now!&&I adore creed, a great movie and i'm a massive rocky fan.  


  
do it. it was a nice change of pace,   


i'd like to mention I just watched creed after watching southpaw and I bleed for this, both were amazing in their own right too. &&Its almost every bit as good as the first movie! Jordan is great in this movie and Stallone was *fantastic*! It loses all of the cheesiness of the the latter *Rocky* movies and sticks with a simple, well scripted story about finding out who you are. &&It’s a fantastic movie. I am pumped for Creed II!&&It's a really solid flick and probably saved our boy's career because of how bad FF was. It a shame if Coogler isn't directing the sequel though. ""Creed"" was all Coogler.&&Excellent movie.&&Nice. &&Even the manliest of straight men can objectively recognize an Olympian God body when he sees one. &&I thought it was dropping today? &&Already? Filming just wrapped like two weeks ago!&&A movie about Creed Bratton would be pretty cool too.&&The only thing I'm concerned with is that Coogler isn't directing it. He's money&&Yeah but sly knows how to put heart and gravitas into his characters, no matter how cheesy or campy. It may not be amazing, but I suspect it will be surprisingly refreshing and not cliché. 

&&For real. I was gunning hard for Stallone winning after Coogler got the Director snub, but Rylance just haaaaad to be in a Spielberg courtroom Cold War movie didn’t he?&&I would have been surprised if he had won considering how Rocky 1 ended and how losing with dignity **is** the trend these days.&&Just like in Rocky!&&Been looking for this comment&&Pretty sure Conlan will be in jail the entire 2nd movie. &&Absolute unit!&&Get paid to workout and be under a sports physician's care and a nutritionist's feeding. &&start going to a gym for about 5 to 6 years &&Eat clen, tren hard, anavar give up&&A great deal of time and effort and access to an extensive pharmacy.&&He wrote the first Rocky, though, at least. &&The guy who posts this obviously works for marketing for these films. Given how quickly they rise it’s also pretty clear that there is vote manipulation going on.

All well and good to promote your films and try to make as much money as possible, but I don’t come on here to be advertised to and I think this behaviour is more than a little shady.&&he's jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes.&&In an interview he said he always stays in shape but its a different type of in shape for the two movies. For Black Panther, he had to modify his diet drastically and get lean muscle while keeping off the weight. He said Creed was easier and more enjoyable because he had to bulk up by eating then work out. &&He gained even more muscle for black panther than in creed. Crazy to think about because he already looked big to me in creed. &&For real, the shit is still hardwork no doubt but I would fucking love to essentially get paid to exercise and have someone else handle the food details.&&Don't forget the super soldier serum that Disney gives out to all their actors.  Plus, Sly is pretty open about how awesome PEDs are and how everyone should use them and I am sure would introduce him to his doctor.&&When... HGH, and other forms of PED’s. Don’t be naive enough to think most of these actors aren’t juicing.&&I always laugh when I see some magazine cover that says ""find out how Khaki Kardashian lost 40 lbs!""

Well, they're rich, their whole job is just to be their dumb selves on TV and pretend like they do things. They don't merely get paid to work out like actors do -- they literally get paid for the activity of working out so the film crew can film their workouts for their TV show where they do nothing besides talk and go places. And then more money comes from social media sponsorships if they are in better looking physical condition.

So yeah, all you have to do to lose 40 lbs and be super rich with access to the best trainers and a job that pays you to lose the weight while literally not having to do anything resembling a real job.&&Seriously and pretty much able to get massages after any workout so soreness is even more easily managed&&Other way around. He gained weight for BP to become more beefy. He cut down for creed after he was already big because boxers are more shredded and emphasize quickness and effectiveness&&It’s the opposite, he had to lean out for Creed, bulked up for BP, and then had to lean out again for Creed ll&&[deleted]&&Holy shit this just blew my mind&&Unexpected Hunter x Hunter&&[deleted]&&I thought I was safe from the hiatus&&Man, I still miss Pitou&&Haha!

If you say so. I'm nowhere near as invested in a rich kid like Creed vs Rocky's humble beginnings.

&&I'm pretty sure it he other way round, no?&&Which interview was that?

Then when he grew up enough, he immediately went away from all that to live in a loud, basically empty, tiny apartment to hope to train with Rocky, followed by sleeping on a single bed that he hangs off of just to train more.

It's not like he was leaning on that money.&&Not as cheesy as the time I ran up the museum stairs and did pushups alone when my mom took us to philly back in the day. Never apologize for the champ &&And not as cheesy as when I didn't run any steps whatsoever anywhere and ate a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.&&damn, not too far from reality&&I could totally see them doing that.&&Considering the producer (Ludwig Göransson) of just about every one of Gambino’s songs (including This is America) also did the soundtrack for Creed, this is legitimately possible.&&If you saw Friday Night Lights in the middle, it would make more sense.  Dude was athletic as heck in there, so you can at least see a path.&&Wait wait wait...what the actual fuck... Michael B. Jordan is Wallace?!? I always had a feeling I've seen him before, now i know where!&&He probably works out.&&I mean Rocky did fight Thunderlips. &&Yeah he’s a freaking monster. When I saw the pic of him when he was announced as playing Drago’s kid I legit made the 😬 face lol. He’s an actual fighter too. No god damn way he’d be able to take him in a non Rocky movie fight lol. &&I love how the search is just his name, and he's shirtless on almost all of the photos. No need to add a ""upper body"" or ""jacked"" to the search. I bet he never puts on a shirt in real life either. I mean... I wouldn't...&&Over the side&&YOU’RE NOT REAL, MAN!&&I really liked the way the entire fight sequences were shot. Loved how the camera would sway with the fighters, shit was way too dope. &&I regularly listen to ""The Fire"" by John Legend and The Roots. Great pump up song.&&Grip

Grip&&Hmm, I’m curious because Sylvester said it was coming out today! I certainly hope it is today &&Were you the dude that messed with Christian Bale's lights?&&Yes, you heard him. He wears the freshest restaurants to eat the chillest dudes and hangs out with the hotttest clothes.&&Not sure if you're unaware but this is a copy pasta meme that originated from the first person shooter game: Counter Striker: Global Offensive in their subreddit or 4chan I believe. &&Hell no, It's the power of the Beard.
What do you think happened when Chris Paul first arrived in Houston? Do you think James Harden met him up for drinks, played pickup B-ball like a normal human being? Fuck no. That's human. James Harden is inhuman, the embodiment of transcendence that occurs only when a spirit truly slips the surly bounds of his human enclosure.
Rather, Harden invited Chris Paul over. He lit candles, put on a nice song. Poured some wine. Laid out some bananas and a boat. I know where you think this is going- but Harden doesn't have any sexual desires. He's immune. Not erect. Chris Paul entered the house, visibly shocked at the internal decor of Harden's Houston pad. Harden remained straight-faced.
Suddenly, Poker Face by Lady Gaga blared over Harden's disco speakers. Harden closed his eyes, seemingly falling into a dormant stupor of a drunken comatose paraplegic. Without moving his lips, he invited Paul to sit near him. Telepathically. Paul, visibly shaking, moved over to Harden. He was suddenly captured by an unspeakable force.
Paul realized he wasn't in the world anymore. No. He was... he was sitting atop a mountain. He glanced to his right. James Harden was nude in a bib and apron making pork chops and broccoli. Perhaps it was stir fry? A fitting dinner for Paul's first night out?
""You see, Paul, this is how I make connections with my teammates"" Harden spoke, without turning around. ""Do you think Dwight was willing to watch me cook stir fry nude on a mountaintop? Fuck no. Do you think any of my previous coaches were willing to have a candlelight virgil while Pokerface played? Fuck no. But you, Christoffer, I see potential in you.""
""Come over here. Touch my fucking beard.""
So Chris Paul walked over in a state of amazement and vague apprehension. He extended a single finger as James turned around, eyes and mouth zipped shut. His face became utterly expressionless; all that was left to notice was the beard. So Paul grabbed it. Suddenly, they were transported back to Harden's pad in Houston. Everything appeared normal. Harden spoke one last time to a visibly shaken Paul.
""You don't even want to know what Russell makes new teammates do.""&&r/suddenlygay &&Isn't it a CSGO meme? Did Jake and Amir do it first?&&Put on that helmet baby&&Eat clen, tren hard, anaver give up, test your limits, Dbolish your haters, and always winn. &&Bet you like when people say they're ""toning"" their muscles too.&&you should take people at their best instead of nitpicking. many people use ""lean muscle"" to distinguish from something like dirty bulking. everyone older than 6 understands the difference b/t fat and muscle. in fact, OP makes it clear he understands the difference in his next sentence. but it's easier to pretend that OP meant something different and laugh because you're insecure. i hope someday you feel better about yourself.&&Yeah I thought he bulked for BP and shred for Creed...

Either way...dude is gifted&&People downvoting you don't have any idea how muscles work. &&Judging from how he looked I'd say you're right. He was jacked in Black Panther &&Working out isn't the hard part. Juggling life and work responsibilities while trying to recover is.&&Yeah, I love the working out part of training, even cardio when I'm outside biking or running. I hate the diet and nutrition part of though. Cheeseburgers and cookies are just so delicious. Can't out run a bad diet though.&&When you have a full-time job, other friends/family commitments outside of said job, other hobbies you enjoy, and oh yea, you like to actually eat and sleep sometimes, then to even start said training is giving up something; most likely hobbies, certain types of eating, and some sleep.  So you know, the actual enjoyable parts of most peoples' lives.

So your answer is to give up some of the more enjoyable parts of your life to do something which is 100% work, to hope that you can learn to enjoy it.  That sounds awful.

edit: So TIL, I'm lazy, unmotivated, my priorities aren't straight, and probably a handful of other things.  Never change, reddit&&Lazy people will find all the excuse why they don’t look the way they want to look. There are dudes in my gym who are jacked and I’m pretty sure they work a 9-5 and don’t have personal trainers and chefs lol. 

There was also an AMA on Reddit the other day too with a guy who lived in his fucking car and still retained his gym membership and now he’s a personal trainer to stars. &&Yeah, no. That guy and the rock are not natural. Compare his old photos with him now&&ya he's full of shit, and just didn't want to say something controversial to lose clients. I wouldn't be surprised if he was the supplier of ped's to his clients haha

Also if you're natty, meal timing has been proven to be bs over and over again &&Of course he's not going to come out and admit to the steroids? Barely anyone in the fitness industry does, some people are open and honest about their steroid use...which attracts a certain type of viewership, BUT the majority are trying to appeal to the average joe like me or you, any PT trainer or fitness vlogger comes out about their steroid use and BAM career suicide&&link to the AMA, just curious&&lmao 100%natty&&Yeah, that motherfucker is roiding&&Most of the general public has no freaking idea how casual PED use is for the general public. If the guy next door can manage a test cycle with no ill effects then you better damn well believe that a multi million dollar actor is going to be rocking that shit too. Truth is that the stigma behind use is ridiculous and exactly why people can't be more honest about it. That being said, it helps a lot, but it sure doesn't make some lazy turd into a ripped god. Credit where it is due. &&the hiatus never goes away completely.  &&""Girl"" &&The only good ant is a dead ant.

Bee girl, though.... :(&&damn can't unsee now&&Thank you I feel.so much more in the joke now!&&The very same&&Better believe it. Comes on teen nick around 11 pm, I always watch after my gf goes to sleep &&There are literally dozens of us!&&YOU'RE NOT REAL MAN!&&BIZNESS&&Making acronyms!!&&Such a great discovery today&&Yes, please do. I actually aspired to be a screenwriter since I was a kid. Sadly depression hit and kept me from chasing my dreams. Oh well. :D&&You know going in the plot is bad, but you also know its gonna be a fun time watching such lunacy.&&I'm going to go the steroid route. Stallone is the canary in the coal mine. 

Also: I'm a lying 135 pound man.&&Whaaaaaaaat&&And on Rocky's 75th birthday, Adonis buys him a robot as a present. 

The robot is played by Evan Rachel Wood. &&[deleted]&&Either that or Ivan drago makes an appearance by getting piss kompromat of  rocky on tape and goes ""I broke you""&&Isn't he fighting Ivan Drago's son in this one?&&More like in Japan or something. China is a huge movie market, and studios go out of their way to avoid pissing them off and getting their movie banned. &&Next it's your turn.&&I love Rocky movies and underdog stories but personally I found Creed more relatable. I quit being athlete when I had chance to go study in university and actually getting paid while doing it. I struggled couple years before that because I had hard time deciding for going safe bet with studying or go for sports and risk everything. It can be hard to dedicate yourself to sports and compete at top level when you have better choises and that is why Creed was positive suprise with it's different point of view in having ""eye of the tiger"". 

I went back to sports while still studying in university since I realized being athlete is something that I want the most and I'm enjoying it more than ever.&&The only thing I wasn't crazy about with Creed is that it never seemed to be clear whether he was for or against living in his dad's shadow, or at the very least, following his path. He seems to flip back and forth, and it's been long enough since I've seen it that I don't remember what he settled on. &&If you go to Philly and didn’t run up the steps did you really go to Philly?&&I had friends from France fly all the way over here so they could run up the stairs in Philly. (They visited other stuff too, but...priorities.)&&I don't remember him from Friday night lights. Maybe I should rewatch that show.&&No way, it's genetics. He totally eats tendies and plays Vidya all day.&&And takes copious amounts of PEDs.&&I agree.....it's the little things the film does to make it fucking legit.&&That one take fight is pretty fuckin amazing.&&The tracking shot for the first fight was awesome&&I listen to “Lord Knows” when I’m running or lifting weights.

It’s hardly the point of the discussion. People get he’s “leaning”. Being technical about it is trivial and nobody cares.&&**people downvoting because they understood what he was trying to say &&What's the deal with lean muscle? &&No, we all understand how it works, we just also know what someone means when they say ""lean muscle"" in a casual conversation about diet and routine and think it's silly to nitpick at technically inaccurate phrases that still do a good job of describing a concept clearly and succinctly. &&I know it's wrong but most people know what he means. &&buy low sell high lol&&While also eating right, whether it be finding time to eat a large amount of calories for your bulk, or juggling your responsibilities while eating less calories and being worn out. On top of affording and consistently eating the right stuff and not junk, I love working out but the nutrition part truly is a bitch. &&Man you said it. I used to work out all the time before my son was born. He's over a year old now and I havent steadily worked out since. I'd love to get back at it but I just don't have the time unless I sacrifice some of what little precious sleep I can get. &&The truth jar overflows in this statement. &&Seriously. If I was given a personal trainer and nutritionist and all that was left for me to do was literally eat the food and do the exercising it would be piss easy. &&I don't even hate the diet/nutrition, so much as the time cost.  I get home from work ~6:30.  If I want a full 8 hours of sleep, I need to be asleep by 10:30.  That leaves 4 hours to get in a workout (including travel to/from the gym, and showering after), and to prepare and eat a healthy meal.  And, you know... hopefully have any sort of free time left over.&&You're just not running fast enough! /s&&Cheeseburgers and cookies are good for you if you follow flexible dieting/IIFYM.&&Jesus, that's guys arm is like a bull thigh. Completely unnatural.&&Yep. As soon as he admits that he takes PEDs he loses all his celebrity clients. Can't have the norms beleving that celebs aren't perfect godlike beings. &&Right. 

Like, if I make money by you thinking you can look like me if you just pay me a certain amount of money and do and eat the things I tell you to do and eat, why would I jeopardize myself by saying ""oh, by the way, if you REALLY want to look like this, you're going to have to take some things that are illegal and its affects on your health are questionable at best.""?&&https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8rt42w/iama_celebrity_fitness_trainer_who_went_from/&&That guy has been binge gaming iirc since I don't know when, only occasionally put up a few sketches-like pages and call it another episode, still get to keep the job somehow, don't understand why&&This better not awaken anything in me. &&Biznus!&&BIZNES!&&I know it’s not just that easy but if one random redditor means anything go chase that dream man&&Growth hormone and steroids. But at that age, some doctors actually recommend doing so to bring levels back to younger levels.

There is no doubt that people nowadays look younger than they used to. People used to be look old in their 60s, and more and more people are still in decent shape at that age. 

Look at how young the actors were when they had white hair in older movies. E.g., Leslie Nielsen was around [54 in Airplane!](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/airplane-movie-image-leslie-nielsen-01.jpg). Still managed to live to 84 though.&&Yep. 57 vs 52.&&Which he gets from his girlfriend charlotte&&“These violent delights have violent ends”&&The fact that Rocky IV had a completely sentient robot that was somehow barely even acknowledged is seriously fucking hilarious. &&RocketMan vs Creed&&Drago is in this one I believe.&&Q.Q&&I get what you’re saying. I think that was part of the point with him though. He says his father situation doesn’t bother him when it obviously does because he feels like Apollo’s dirty little secret that got left behind. It’s an emptiness he’s trying desperately to fill through fighting (even though he realistically doesn’t have to) because that’s a passion they truly share.&&No... 😔&&He plays the kid who looks like that kid from the wire but a little older&&So the first 2 seasons, he wasn't there. Then season 3, they basically relaunched the show with half the cast changing.  MBJ was the main ""kid"" in those last couple of seasons which I think were the best seasons of the show.&&Yay There's Hope for me. &&Free. Meek. &&Timezones&&Yes, you heard him. He wears the freshest dudes to eat the chillest clothes and hangs out with the hottest restaurants.
&&Wait... Yeah what?

FTFY&&I usualy don't reply , but you guys sure made me laugh enough to do so... Here take a !RedditSilver&&Ill be honest, I'm pretty sure it started with a Jake and Amir video that people then used as copypasta for CSGO. 

This is the video in reference, and the original comments I can find were dated after this video.

https://youtu.be/ZeFPlu7bqxw?t=35&&It’s what we do &&It is. Although it took off abeyond people recognizing the reference. One of my most downvoted comments was me trying to give the reference a proper source once hah. Made me shed tears of soy. &&Thanks! &&Fucking muscles, how do they work. &&everyone understood what OP meant. there is a small cadre of insecure knobs who are pretending he meant that muscle could be fatter or leaner when in truth it's just muscle. in fact, everyone knows that ""lean muscle"" when used in this context means you gain as much muscle mass as possible while accumulating as little fat as possible, in contrast to dirty bulking where you gain a bunch of muscle by eating everything and gain a corresponding amount of fat as well.&&In case this is a serious question and not a continuation of our meme train, there is no such thing as lean muscle. Muscle is going to look the same regardless of how you increase its size. Certain activities stimulate some muscle groups more than others, which is why athletes for different sports look different from one another. This difference in the proportion of muscle groups is what leads some people to believe that the exercise you do has some effect on the shape and ""quality"" of the muscle, rather than just the size. &&I feel you.  Once my daughter was born I just couldn't make time like before to work out.  Now 2 years later I am finally getting sleep and I have a little more flexibility in my schedule to get back into it.&&That my problem. Up at 6:30, out the door by 7. Back home around 8. That gives like 2.5 hours of free time before getting my 8 hours of sleep. Making and eating dinner takes up probably an hour of that time leaving me with 90 minutes to relax and stuff. I can eat well, but I love coming back from work and relaxing on the couch rather than spending an hour working out. I don't want to be in ""go mode"" all the time...&&Still not good for you, but you can eat them while losing weight that way. Sugar and cheese are not as good a source of carbs, fats, and proteins as other foods.&&I thought they were photoshopped as a joke at first. Not only are they massive, they are weirdly massive compared to the rest of him. &&We basically accept they do cocaine, drink, smoke, and take pills....but steroids??? Or any other Ped? Nnoo!!!???? 

People are weird.&&Exactly! 

The sense of hope is what drives the whole industry. Tbh i just try to ignore the fitness vloggers/models by putting the head down and lift some iron, eat well, stay consistent and enjoy it all!

Sounds like you need more life in your work/life balance friend.&&Mental health problems treated with gaming?&&Boxing is just what he loves to do and he wants to be like his dad. He doesn't have the issue following in his dad's footsteps as much as he doesn't want people to see him as a ""rich kid"" who got fights handed to him because of his Daddy's name(which he never had). He wants to prove that he's every bit as legitimate as Apollo both as his son and a boxer. Hence why he finally wore the name Creed for that last fight. It's his way of coming into his own and claiming his legacy. Before that no one really knew he was Apollo's, so he had that chip on his shoulder.&&Sorry, I try to block out the season where Landry and Tyra (sp?) kill a guy and his dad, the cop, burns his car up so there's no evidence, then we move on like nothing happened.&&I’ve come to bargain &&So fat&&I understand.

Halloween - Official Trailer,26442,8pk3hv,https://youtu.be/ek1ePFp-nBI,3862,1528466426.0,,"Michael in the closet is such a great gag. Gotta avoid all the other trailers after this. Also fuck yeah we'll get a new John Carpenter score.&&There's something about Michael Myers just walking around a busy street of Trick or Treaters like it's nothing that is so badass and awesome to me.  &&""Wasn't it her brother who murdered all those babysitters?""

""No. That was not her brother, that was something people made up""

As a fan. That made me laugh&&Honestly... pretty good! The teeth over the bathroom stall, him keeping the closet door from closing at the end, it looks like McBride has made a genuine Halloween movie. Also, Laurie looks badass! That hidden stairway under the counter is awesome. &&Who in their right fucking mind thought giving Michael his mask back was a good idea?&&DAMN Laurie Strode bout to go Sarah Connor on Michael Myer's ass&&And you know what I love about this? It's actually getting released right before Halloween! Just wouldn't be right otherwise. &&> I was hoping he'd escape... so I can kill him.

OK, you've sold me, McBride.

&&Now to not watch another trailer till it's released.&&""He's not her brother. That's just something people made up."" LOL

What a way to say, ""All the other movies are bullshit.""&&The Halloween theme is up there with the Jaws, Imperial Match and Jurassic Park themes in terms of how iconic it is. &&Halloween works so well because it simplified it's premise down to the marrow.  It's hard to recapture that kind of effect, but I'm totally down for this sequel.

The teeth bit is fantastic.&&*silver shamrock theme intensifies* &&Bless Jamie Lee Curtis for continuing to do right by Laurie Strode, the original (and ultimate) Final Girl.

And if this movie kills her off and lets Michael live, I will be pissed.&&The return of that sound effect when michael pops up out of nowhere sent my wig to mars. &&[deleted]&&Jamie Lee Curtis as Sarah Connor as Laurie Strode&&Great callbacks to the first one :

Laurie telling kids to run by the car identical to Loomis telling the kids to run

Killing the mechanic first

Soundtrack

Laurie's scar on her shoulder

&&""Bitch stop closing this god damn cupboard door on my foot""&&CANT WAIT TO HEAR THAT THEME SONG IN THEATERS!! &&Jamie Lee Curtis taking absolutely no shit is my jam&&""You don't believe in the Boogeyman, do you?""

Well, you know who you send to kill the fucking Boogeyman...&&This looks pretty decent! Mask is on point &&Love that this film completely ignores all the sequels that took place after the 1978 original.&&I'd be mad if this was just Laurie Strode pallet looping or Meyers just tunneling and camping for 2 hours. &&""From the director of Pineapple Express.""&&What are the odds Laurie visits Dr. Loomis' grave as an homage to Donald Pleasence?&&Actually looks pretty decent so far. I haven't seen any of the movies other than the original Halloween but this looks like they are trying something fairly different to that in tone. And Laurie is going to be a badass, which will be fun to watch. Count me in!&&Jamie Lee Curtis back in this franchise is a very welcome return.&&That bathroom stall scene had a touch of Halloween H20 on it.  Great trailer though.&&""Let's watch *Halloween*!""

""Which one?""

""The new one.""

""The remake?""

""The sequel.""

""*Halloween 2*? Nah, I hated all that hallucinating-his-mother shit.""

""No, the sequel to the original.""

""Oh! The one where you find out he's Laurie's brother?""

""No, the *newest* sequel!""

""...*Resurrection*? Christ, that was awful.""

""No! There's a new film that's a sequel to the original film and retcons all the others.""

""Oh, cool. What's it called?""

""*Halloween*.""

""No, what's the sequel called?""

""*HALLOWEEN*.""

""The sequel to *Halloween* is called *Halloween*?""

""Yes!""

""...""

""...""

""No.""&&Hoping they dont pull some weird twist where the documentary guy turns out to be the killer or something. Apparently they are redoing the ending due to poor testing. &&Great way to retcon the rest lol&&[deleted]&&Danny Mcbride is such a badass dude.

Also isn't Michael Myers from Halloween just a dude?

Like he doesn't have undead powers or anything?&&The original is one of my all time favorites, hope this doesn't suck!&&Looks great. 

As someone who has only seen the original and the Rob Zombie remake, is it worth watching the others? &&I'm excited for this. I can't put my finger on the reason why, but Michael Myers is just so much more terrifying to me than Freddy, Jason, Leatherface or any other horror movie slasher.&&I just love the new mask so much. I hope we don't get another situation where we see his face without the mask.&&I'm *very* interested in the other patients. Why do they freak out at the mask and what do they do with their freedom while Michael goes to kill Laurie? Also, what the hell are they doing in that yard? It's like they're chained to a checkerboard. I'm assuming this is a loophole for a prisoner's right to outdoor time?&&From babysitter to grandmother.  What a crazy ride it's been! &&OOOH YEAH BABY. I hope this does well and they revive Jason too.&&If they can get some competent directors, I wouldn't mind Universal trying the Dark Universe over again, but with 80's slasher characters. Jason, Freddy, Michael, Pinhead, Ghostface(s), Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. The original ending for Freddy Vs. Jason even had Pinhead appearing at the very end.

>A final ending considered but never shot saw Pinhead from the 'Hellraiser' franchise come to earth and take both Freddy and Jason to hell, saying, ""what seems to be the problem, gentlemen?"" as he takes possession of both Freddy's glove and Jason's mask. This would have obviously set up a very interesting future film to include all three, but due to the rights issues with the 'Hellraiser' franchise, this plan was scrapped.&&This is the scariest activia commercial ever&&[deleted]&&Just what I was hoping for, more Carpenter, less Zombie.&&Stoked. As. Fuck. 

Love the Halloween series. Kinda weird they’re disregarding EVERY other movie but I’m still excited. &&How has Bill Shatner never had a cameo in one of these?&&That's a Halloween movie, alright&&Amazing! This is definitely going to be the best portrayal of Laurie Strode that we've seen, love how fearless and determined she's going to be from beginning to end in this. The bathroom and closet kills look awesome and like they'll end up being super memorable within the franchise as a whole, I quite like the dropping of the teeth haha. And from a directional standpoint I'm also very impressed. Clearly very well directed with more of a budget than most Blumhouse movies get which I'm very happy about because this needed to be big. &&Closet scare scene at the end looked so cool and different. No build up music, slow evolution, just so random for the girl to open the door and he's just standing there. Three kids in the room. Damn my body is ready&&So is this Halloween 2 then? Because it says he was locked up for 40 years.&&I love that Laurie has become Loomis 2.0, training to kill Michael in case he returns. I hope she gets to finally do it. &&Damn, I'm cautiously optimistic after this. The retcons, Curtis being a badass and just all around seems to have the atmosphere Halloween should have.&&Dude, why would you show him the mask!? 

Also, that theme tune is still as shit scary as it used to be &&I will definitely be seeing this in the theater at a comfortable 2 pm showing. &&Ya know, I just realized something: now that the story erases Michael and Laurie being related, Michael's motivations for going after her all these years later is that he still holds a grudge against Laurie's friend insulting his driving. &&The music is just as spooky as it was the first time I heard it! &&Looks like they're still using shatner mask which is cool&&When that music hits... Every hair on my body collectively stands on end. &&Those overhead shots of the prison yard look great&&Oh god I used to jerk off to that woman in True Lies.  My sexual awakening....  Fuck I'm getting old.&&So these are the different ways the series can be watched.

&&As someone who's never seen a Halloween movie, how should I start? 

The trailer kinda confused me cause I always assumed he was some supernatural monster, like Jason. But this makes him look like a normal human.&&The original is my favorite horror film of all time. This trailer is great, please dont suck!&&The biggest horror movie of the year is going to be a 60 year old woman with a gun versus a 71 year old man with a knife and I can't wait&&I swear, if they dont let laurie either kill him or at the least take him down with her then i will be very. very. dissapointed.&&Laurie Strode goes full Sarah Connor. &&Jamie Lee Curtis is the QUEEN!! BOW DOWN BITCHES!!! I can’t wait to see this!!! &&I knew he was in the closet, but I still jumped&&I hate that they used it in the trailer though. I assume they had it set up better. Playing it in the trailer makes it very obvious Michael is right there. I wonder if I would have expected it in the movie itself. &&I was so psyched when I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZDiOzoq2Uc)&&And michael's just standing there like ""ow.....ow.....ow.....bitch just open the door!""&&He’s just trying to get that candy man &&That's the best part! It's Halloween so he can just walk around and blend in.&&As someone who loves horror movies, it is my shame to admit I’ve never seen any Halloween movies. What previous ones should I see before watching this one?&&My neighbors make a Michael Myers figure every year on halloween in their front yard and it looks so legit I would never go to their house as a kid lmao&&""Isn't he immortal through the curse of the thorn?""  

""...leave.""&&Michael is so much more terrifying when you know theyre not related. Like he went on a killing spree and wanted to kill Laurie just because he saw her on the doorstep and decided ""im going to kill her""

edit: Because people seem to be confused by this, in the original Halloween film you didnt know Michael was related to Lauire, that wasnt revealed until Halloween 2. So in the original, Michael is just protrayed as a psycho killing random people. &&Me too. The thing is, though, John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote that twist in HII.&&I have never watched any of the movies, can you explain the joke plz&&FWIW, I liked that they were related.

Some of the later sequels got silly with the story, but if you're going to focus this semi-reboot on two characters, why is it a bad thing to have them related?&&I never doubted David Gordon Green and Danny McBride could not make a horror movie, DGG is just all around great director who can hop from genre to genre and Vice Principals got pretty damn dark. There was even pretty much a jump scare in season 2 that was seriously creepy.&&This trailer somehow exceeded my already high expectations for this film. &&That’s almost on par with giving Jason his machete back in Jason X&&AND apparently moving Michael to a different prison? NEAR HALLOWEEN TIME. Move his ass around Valentine's Day for fuck sake. &&A documentarian that desperately wants to get compelling footage. &&I don't disagree that sounds dumb but what I got from the trailer is that Michael escapes from prison, kills the documentary crew at a rest stop and takes a jump suit from a mechanic and the mask from the director. I don't think the director actually gives him back the mask while he's in the mental hospital but he just awakens Michael's primal, evil urges. &&To be fair, it doesn't look like they give it back. It looks like they try to get this otherwise silent inmate to react. It's not a terribly uncommon interview tactic. It's only after they meet up at the gas station that Michael takes the mask back. &&Reporter : Yo Crazy guy!  Heres your face and your machete.  Now lets talk about your mother issues. &&The guy clearly has an obesession with Michael and will help him kill other people etc&&I don’t think he was giving it back, but attempting to get a reaction from him by showing to Michael. It looks like he retrieves it at the gas station. Which means he wanted that mother fucker bad&&Jamie Lee Curtis is looking like a badass in this. She's still got it &&Really liking this twist on things. &&Someone's been eating their Activia pro-biotic poop good yogurt they endorse. &&Yeah the Rob Zombie Halloweens being released in August always bugged me.&&It's Halloween; everyone's entitled to one good scare.&&I hope they keep her alive in the movie as the final girl again and not switch it part way to a younger actress to get revenge for killing her. Let them fight and let that fight have some back history to it&&If it bleeds, we can kill it.&&Agreed.  This one did the job of convincing me I needed to see it.  Don't need to risk any further shots being spoiled.&&""He's not her brother. Her daughter isn't a mute psychic. There's no cult devoted to him. She didn't move across the country. They never made a reality show about his old house. He wasn't a mask-obsessed redneck. Also, and this is completely unrelated, a futuristic coven of witches never made masks that exploded if kids watched a certain Halloween special.""&&To be fair, the first film never stated they were siblings. So I don’t know if the characters are incorrect in the actual film or if the film is indeed trying to retcon what the part 2 did. &&Good. The original deserved better than it did and it looks like we're finally getting someone competent directing.&&It's so fucking simple yet so menacing. It really makes you feel uneasy.&&Right?? Carpenter was a genius for coming up with that theme.

The trailer got me thinking of Trent Reznor's version at this part of the song: https://youtu.be/DAbDvqPFXvQ?t=378&&How could ya forget Indie??&&Yeah I have never watched a Halloween movies and really don't watch horror movies at all... but I got goosebumps from hearing that theme... that I didn't even know was the Halloween theme... but it is definitely an iconic movie theme...

theme theme theme.&&The soundtrack for Halloween 3 is highly underrated.

[This track in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsHMnWAjICs&list=PL6E1FC8A1B4F1F681) is my favorite, it's really worth listening to the whole thing.

That 80s horror synth sound is just incredible, it's so suspenseful.&&Yeah, people forget how minimalist the first Halloween is. There's barely any gore and the body count is paltry compared to most slashers. But its also by far the best because its so effective with what little it shows.

Glad to see these filmmakers seem to understand this, even if 30 years of shit sequels didn't.&&That was awesome. I was wondering what in the hell Mike would be scattering on the floor and then when I saw the teeth I was like “Oh what else could it have been.” &&I don't care what people say, Season of the Witch is bloody entertaining as fuck. &&Happy happy Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Happy happy Halloween

This. Laurie deserves her revenge&&I could see her sacrificing herself to ensure his demise&&Sally from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre would like to have a word with you&&Now Mars has Propane and your wig.  It's becoming a real hot spot.&&Sort of excuses it, in my sub conscious. The sequels were just fan fiction and urban legend, some good, some bad.&&The more I think about this, the more I like it.

I can kinda say in my head that all the halloween movies are stories/urban legends that folks have made up in the last 40 years. Ghost stories that kids tell at camp fires.&&And I am here for it. &&as the *regular* Activia lady&&Also Michael in the bedsheet ghost costume &&The mechanic one is also a callback to “The Return of Michael Myers”. It’s basically a double callback in one.&&Probably wouldn’t have stabbed her otherwise. “Bitch I was waiting for someone else, but you had to act out.”&&I imagine Michael wincing in pain under the mask every time she tries to close the door. lol&&You're lucky.  I've been waiting over a decade to hear the Halo theme in theatres. &&It’ll be the first time for me, so damn excited!&&Jamie Lee Curtis always takes a shit, because she is regular thanks to Activia.&&John Wick vs Micheal &&Michael killed two dogs in the original. Just saying.&&Doctor\-fucking\-Loomis&&The mask IMO is probably one of the best looking so far &&That's not what I think of when I hear [""Mike Meyers Halloween Mask""](https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/d/2/5/8/4/6/d25846db0b0da0f8e735739cef457c01dc018318.jpg)&&I’m a MM nerd and it was the first thing I looked for in this trailer. It’s pretty solid. I was worried that it was too weathered but they captured the original face shape well and I think they intended to do that. I hope they consulted some of the present day Myers mask makers on this because those guy really know their shit and make incredible reproductions!&&I love that the guy who played Michael Myers in the original film is playing him again for this one \- his name is Nick Castle&&I mean look at the trailer we literally see the moment he gets to Evil Within III, we know this boys been eating pallets for breakfast&&Yassss.  Was hoping there'd be a DBD comment in this thread somewhere.&&It wasn't Michael in there keeping the closet open, it was Dwight staying planted for days on end.&&Huyah huyah huyah huyah!

(Seth Rogan laugh under the mask intensifies.)&&David Gordon Green is very versatile. He started directing Malick style indies before he moved to comedy and has mentioned in interviews he loves all genres of film and doesn’t want to be pigeon holed as “the comedy guy/the indie guy, etc”&&We'll probably get a discussion where she explained that she Loomis had a few long conversations about Michael before Loomis died, and he was the one advising her to be ready for his return.&&I don’t think he would have been buried in Haddonfield lol&&Halloween 2 (1981) is pretty underrated. Really good sequel. Season of the Witch has nothing to do with Michael Myers but I still really like it&&The H20 bathroom stall scene was awesome! I’m down with any horror movie that messes with your expectations.&&Yes! Good reference. Can’t help but also seeing that the scene where Strode points the gun at Michael as he is in the upstairs window looks reminiscing to the scene in Halloween (original) where Strode looks out HER window to see Michael standing in between the clothes lines. &&...Or you could just say Halloween 2018. It's what we've been doing with all the remake titles from Platinum Dunes. &&Halloween (1978)

Halloween (2007)

Halloween (2018)

Not only has Hollywood given up on original film ideas, they have given up on original film titles. With that being said, I will be watching this movie.&&Counting this one, the last three Halloween movies, in order, were titled:

*Halloween*    
*Halloween 2*    
*Halloween*

They are the 9th, 10th, and 11th movies in the franchise.  These reboots and titles are way out of control.&&Who's on first&&Does anyone know what the original ending was/is?&&The way the trailer pushes thing, I get the feeling neither of them are ever going to actually make it to Haddonfield. They're expositional dead meat. &&Again!&&I recognise that mask, verrry cool&&I would recommend 2, and H20 as decent films that act as a trilogy.  
I like 3 as well, but it's a separate thing with nothing to do with Michael.&&Yes, the others are absolutely worth watching if you're a fan of the slasher genre. 2, 4, and H20 specifically but I enjoy all of the sequels to some degree. You can't go on having only watched the Zombie movies.&&In my opinion it's because he's so human. Freddy, Jason, Pinhead, none of those could exist in our world. But Michael, as he was presented originally, could. &&[deleted]&&it looks like we will get his face in glimpses, which im ok with since we did briefly see it in the original&&I think seeing his face in the original movie was awesome. It shows you that he’s just another boy, he even looks really gentle and like a high school jock. It just makes it all more chilling. But I think seeing a 60 year old mans face wouldn’t have the same effect in this movie hahahha&&[I have a feeling when we see his face after taking off the mask it will look something like this ](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/207/210/b22.jpg) &&[deleted]&&New Line tried this in 90s when they wanted to do Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash (from EVIL DEAD). At one point Leatherface was in the mix too.&&Yea, same here. As soon as Hollywood started with the cinematic universes thing I immediately thought this is the crossover they need to be doing.&&""it goes right through you, just like *this!*""

*Michael impales someone with his knife*&&Scattered teeth dropped over a gas station bathroom stall does it for me, too. &&That's what John Carpenter's music does&&I swear to God I was watching the trailer and I looked down and I didn't even realize I was jerking off.&&Yeah, that was a good one. Shame they already gave it away in the trailer.&&It ignores everything but the first movie, so yes.&&After doing some digging, this Halloween (2018) is apparently intended to be a direct sequel to the original Halloween (1978). If you're itching for this, you have only one movie in front of you.

If you want the ""Laurie Strode"" story as it is right now, 1, 2, H20, and Resurrection are what you want. Halloween 3 is not related at all (but is a personal favorite of mine). Halloweens 4, 5, and 6 and their plotlines are ""non-canon,"" so it's up to you if you care about that kind of thing or not (but they're not viewed highly regardless). &&That's what my mom said when I told her I was gay.&&The fear of a bad thing you know approaching is often worse than the fear of something unexpected. Part of the reason why people hate jump-scares so much (beyond the music cues) is how cheap they are compared to well-wrought tension.&&It's because at this point we expect her to open the closet and him not be in it, but when she closes it he is suddenly behind her or something.   It's so fucking awesome, literally the stuff of nightmares.&&I’m glad we’re so accepting of gay serial killers, now. Judge them on their actions, not their orientation!&&Jump scares don't need to be a surprise to work. Half of the scare comes from the anticipation. The other half comes from the music/ sound fx. That's why a lot of people are bothered by them, they're too easy. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC0kCyF1A7U) some jump scares with the scary sound effects removed.&&Hey, with any luck, it was a scene just for the trailer, and it happens a different way.&&Why else would they show someone trying to close a door for ten seconds if it wasn't because Michael Myers was behind there?&&Don’t pretend for a second that the moment a baby sitter tried to close a closet door all nonchalantly in a Halloween movie, your brain wouldn’t have immediately said “Michael’s in there”.&&Candyman vs Michael confirmed &&If people would give him candy and stop running from him maybe he'd stop dropping motherfuckers.&&Just the first one. This one is a direct sequel to the original, and they are pretending like the other ones never existed. 

Then after you watch this new one, you have all of the rest if you want more Michael Myers. &&Just the first one. This upcoming film is treating **only** the original as canon, so you can get away with ignoring everything else.

However, I have little doubt that many subtle references to the other films we be made.&&“...like now”&&""Wasn't he in space fighting Freddy Krueger?""

""That's jason, asshole""&&“Didn’t she chop some guy’s head off that was dressed like her not-brother?”&&""Wasn't he the puppet of a celtic cult that was using him to impregnate his niece who was in love with him to give birth to their new messiah but ultimately his psychiatrist was given the mark of immortality and cursed to serve like Michael was?""

""....there was a reason the producer's cut took 20 years to be released""&&""He sure is!""  Ant-Man&&This looks very interesting, but even if they're not counting every other movie after 1 (since they say in this Trailer that Michael was shot by Loomis and taken into custody), this sorta ruins the ending of the first movie where Michael vanishes after falling off the balcony, and his breathing is heard throughout the credits, implying he's still out there. The fact that he was caught and arrested is kinda weird, but at least the movie looks interesting.&&""Wasn't he a whiny crybaby as a kid on par with Anakin Skywalker who was bullied by Rob Zombie clones and Rob Zombie r63 cosplays?""&&Yeah and her friends were just “Well, since I’m here. And the mouthy one is definitely going first.”

Makes it more terrifying if you think about it. Doing mundane things such as leaving a key under the mat for your dad so he can try to sell a house and end up on the radar of a guy wearing a Captain Kirk mask.

&&I can never take “Michael Myers” seriously as a murderer name. 

It would be like the next serial killer being named Steven Martin...just doesn’t work in my head&&Carpenter wrote it drunk &&but they later regretted it&&And Carpenter hated it  &&I’m confused. I thought I saw and remembered the films. Wasn’t it the little boy at the start of H1 who killed his sister and arguably went after family?&&It was actually revealed in the extended version of the original.&&[deleted]&&Yeah, I'm a lifelong Halloween fan and I've never understood the hate for that decision. Especially now that this is very much a Laurie vs. Michael story, I feel like it would make more sense with that connection. Like if she were just another girl that he killed, why would he be coming back to her after forty years?&&I loved Vice Principals and had forgotten that this was essentially the same collaborators... makes me sad that Goggins won’t be making an appearance. Maybe they can CG his face onto whoever is playing Michael! hehehe&&> There was even pretty much a jump scare in season 2 that was seriously creepy.

Heh, I know the one you're talking about. There's another moment that while not scary was still creepy to watch [at the end of the second last episode in season 2 when the shot lingers on Ms. Abbott and you realize she's the shooter](#spoiler)

[Vice Principal spoilers](https://streamable.com/ei10h)&&""Guys, it's ok! He just wanted his machete back! *Whew!*""&&I unapologetically love Jason X. It's so campy and ridiculous and it doesn't take itself the least bit seriously &&Near Valentine = Michael escape to find lost love

Near St. Patty = Michael escape to get drunk

Near Easter = Michael escape to find eggs

Near July 4 = Michael escape to enjoy fireworks

Near Thankgiving = Michael escape to eat turkey 

Near Christmas = Michael escape to open presents

Near New Year = Michael escape to watch ball drop in New York City

Near Martin Luther King day = Michael escape to celebrate black history

Michael win every time&&I’m really interested to see where they go with that bit. In the trailer it seems like Michael follows the crew after his bus wrecks to get his mask back.&&Yeah I thought it was pretty obvious he was hoping to instigate a reaction out of Michael for his doc. Maybe even few words. Instead they instigated that evil patience of his. 

So cool!&&You're thinking of Jason &&That's what I liked about the trailer. Same thing with scream 4. *spoilers kind of * that Sydney wasn't going to be a victim and was going to fight back. She wasn't afraid.

So I'm interested to see where this goes. &&It’s also rare to see an older woman in a role like this so, although I’ve never been into Halloween series, I’m down to get into this. Badass Grandma with a shotgun? Count me in.&&""Miiichaaaaelllll""

Oh, shit...&&It's the yogurt&&Michael and her are going to go out in flames together. &&She's badass in H20 (which doesn't count anymore) too. She sends her kid and his girlfriend on their way, locks herself in with Michael, and grabs a fucking axe, lol. It's pretty badass if you've never seen it. &&bc it's always Halloween for Rob Zombie&&*Halloween's 11: One Last Scare, and We're Outta this Business*&&They're going to die together, I bet. She'll die, but she's taking him with her. &&I think this film would rule if Laurie is indeed the final girl again even if it means the new main young girl dies and all the people important to her die. 

But it's now kinda funny to picture an older man behind the mask as Michael was supposed to be 21 years old in the first film. 
&&Hahahahah....ahhaahha..AAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA&&Your comment has convinced me to not even watch this trailer, gonna wait till it comes out. Thank you &&> Also, and this is completely unrelated, a futuristic coven of witches never made masks that exploded if kids watched a certain Halloween special.""

That movie really was ridiculous in a charming way.&&Damn I forgot about the Michael Myers cult movie with Paul Rudd. Only saw it once as a kid when I was growing up and obsessed with the character; you know the sixth movie must be really shitty if AMC will show Halloween 4 and 5 a million times during Halloween but not that one.&&It was a fun nod though. All three masks are in the trailer.&&Aww but Halloween 3 is where the series should have went. An annual anthology series would have been awesome. Instead of the laundry list of complete nonsense we ended up with&&It's already been confirmed to retcon everything but 1&&Yea part 2 never happened in this film.&&Hey man, as a kid from the 80s, those Halloween sequels were awesome back then.  Sure they are pretty cheesy looking back now, but horror fans of that era enjoyed them.

Is it ok to like them and still be excited for this sequel or is that not boughie enough?&&Hells yes thisnmovie looks like a great sequel &&The second one still holds up. &&As a music theory dude, do you know what I find cool? As simple as it is, it's actually one of the few popular pieces of music/tunes that's in a complex time signature: 5/4. More often than not, music [especially Western music] is divided into counts of 4 or 3 (1 - 2 - 3 - 4, or 1 - 2 - 3). However, the Halloween theme has an extra beat added to it (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5), which almost gives you the sense of not being able to find the real beat, and that can cause unease when listening to it. &&Check out Lost Themes by Carpenter, it's an album of all the themes he wrote but never got to use, and it's amazing!&&One of the only tapeworm songs to see the light of day.&&Anyone who's into Carpenter's themes should check out Goblin. They were an awesome band from the 70s that wrote music for a bunch of movies, most famously Dario Argento's Suspiria. Big inspiration for Carpenter. The resemblance of that movie's music to the Halloween theme is unmistakable. When the frontman of Goblin met Carpenter years later, he introduced himself and Carpenter said ""I know who you are, I've been stealing from you for years!""&&and Superman.&&good track

we need more synths in modern music&&> Suspense is like a woman. The more left to the imagination, the more the excitement.... 

- Alfred Hitchcock

Hitchcock turned me to the mindset that the more you leave to the imagination, the more terrifying things get. A director can never out terrify a person's own imagination imo. 

That's why things like Blair Witch, Halloween, Jaws all worked so well. You only really got a subtle tease until the end.

EDIT: How the fuck did I forget Alien? &&Confetti. He loves to celebrate. &&Candy that he expected her to catch.

Still awesome to bring him back though, I’m pretty sure that shot in the mental hospital’s courtyard where we see his back profile/the scenes before he gets the mask back must be Castle and knowing it’s the original actor will for sure give me a little extra goosebumps to those scenes.&&That's actually really surprising but cool.&&He for sure hit EW3,using a mirror no less. Insta-kill incoming.&&[deleted]&&I agree. What Halloween 2 does so well is address the effects of the first time. When the Sheriff finds out about his daughter, it's a devastating realistic scenario that we *rarely* ever experience in a horror film. We see both the aftermath, **and** the rampage continue.&&Halloween III is so fucking good. It’s crazy but fun, only gets hate for not being a Myers film&&Halloween ‘18 has a nice ring to it&&Oh wow, I didn't realize that one company was responsible for most of the big budget horror movie reboots as of late. Also, they are working on a Dora the Explorer movie... 

The company that brought back Voorhees, Krueger, Leatherface, and the Hitcher is going to release a Dora the Explorer movie. Why am I so intrigued by this?&&[deleted]&&It get confusing for sure.  At least 2007 was a remake and not a direct sequel like this one.

The one that burns me is:

*First Blood*

*Rambo: First Blood Part II*

*Rambo III*

*Rambo*&&I've only heard rumors, but the poor testing was due to it being an ambiguous ending of sorts. COMPLETE rumors, but someone thought it ended similarly to the original movie where michael disappears and audiences were like ""What?""&&I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW HIM!&&Was H20 the one that ended with Jamie Lee Curtis stealing an ambulance and chopping of Michael's head?  That one wasn't bad.&&4 doesn't get enough of a fair shake. That ending is dope.&&I really liked H20. Ressurection was ridiculous though.&&[deleted]&&And underneath? Brad Pitt.&&Bruce Campbell talked about Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, and he said the problem was that nobody wanted to die/lose. They copped out in the Freddy vs. Jason movie with this, and they wouldn’t let Ash kill either of them on screen, so Campbell said he wasn’t dying if he didn’t get to take anybody with him, so the whole thing was scrapped. Feel like a slasher movie battle Royale would always run into a problem like that, especially when the rights to various characters are held by different entities all putting their two cents into the equation.&&Unrelated, is a teeth fetish a thing?&&Might not actually be in the movie - a lot of movies lately have been putting misdirection in trailers.

&&Which wasn't part of the script or shooting of principle photography of part 1. They needed to pad the film for the TV edit as the running time wasn't sufficient after the TV edits.&&So they scrapped away the story from 2 through 5?&&Because Michael is scarier without a motive. Try watching the original film without the sibling connection in mind. It’s terrifying because it could happen to anyone. 

I love the sequels btw. I just think this idea has merit and will make Michael scary again, which he hasn’t been since 1978 imo. &&On a sort of tangent, I think the lack of motive works better for Michaels turn as a child. That sets the tone way better and than making them unrelated ever could. He's killed one sister and is going after another but his reasons for it are unknown and unexplainable. To me there's terror in that.

Thats the reason I hated the Rob Zombie version so much because he tried to explain Michaels childhood to where there is some sort of understanding as to why he ended up the way he did with Zombies white trash fetish, straight up ruined a classic. With Carpenters version you assume he's a normal kid in a normal family until that night.&&The original Michael is playing Michael &&I don't care how bad that movie was, this particular scene is pure gold.

Still liked it in its own cheesy way. &&[deleted]&&It's not so much that it's shitty than it is the ending is a butchered cliffhanger that will never see a resolution due to Donald Pleasance's passing right after the movie was finished.&&I was excited for that. Unfortunately nobody had any clue that is what they were trying to do and movie goers were pissed there was no Michael Myers.&&I can't say I mind. The lore of the Halloween series got a bit crazy. &&TIL, thanks for the info. I always wondered why it seemed I couldn't keep up with the notes, they seemed out of place&&Never noticed that, very interesting! There is also the use of the tritone, which makes for an uneasy feeling.&&This is cool. I remember reading that the original Terminator theme was in a weird time signature also. 13/16 if I recall correctly.&&Yeah. The human mind loves patterns and when we hear or see something that doesn't fit the norm it automatically makes us feel uncomfortable. Like when you see a person's face that doesn't have bilateral symmetry. &&Wait what? What does the TR&AR version have to do with Tapeworm&&[deleted]&&Just go with ""pretty much anything John Williams came up with in the 1970s.""&&And the best thing about Jaws was that it wasn't even intended. The reason we don't see much of the shark is because the damn thing wouldn't actually work properly. It's the perfect example of a film being improved by its production woes. &&The end of a horror movie is what separates the good ones from the greats, IMO. So many horror movies have strong premises and entertaining opening acts. Not so many can carry that right through to a satisfying conclusion. The three you mentioned are definitely good in that regard. 

I remember how much flack Blair Witch caught for that ending when it first came out, but what would people have preferred? A thirty minute monster mash sequence where the witch chases the heroes around until one of them manages to gruesomely kill her? Boring! I'd much rather have no idea what happened. My imagination did so much with that creepy little taste in the last few minutes. Really terrifying. &&They were Skittles. He wanted her to taste the rainbow!&&Tom Atkins is the worst father ever in that movie and yet he somehow makes it totally OK! Just neglecting his kids, yelling at his ex wife, getting loaded, banging a stranger he just met. All hail Tom Atkins. &&""One time Michael wasn't even there and it was some fucking witches killing people and shit! I swear to god!""&&That’s what I think. The body is too small and limp to be Michael I think.&&If I pulled that off Would he die? &&Not gonna lie, it might be my favorite movie of all time if tried something like this.

Imagine: 

A babysitter tripped on the ground, scrambling to get away. She's caught in a corner of the house! She grabs the curtains closest to the window, crying, clutching the curtains and awaiting her imminent death. 

Michael slowly lumbers towards her, butcher knife raised into the air and ready to drop with thunderous force into the babysitter... when all of sudden, Michael bangs his shin on a coffee table that was knocked askew when the babysitter crawled towards the corner!

Michael drops instantly to the floor, as well as the knife from his hand. His hands fly to the spot where the table has bumped into his shin and Michael, for the first time, speaks: ""Goddammit! That really hurts! Oh Jesus, nothing has *ever* hurt this much! Son of a bitch, what is this table made of?! Oh, God, I think its already bruised! Hey, kid? Can you please grab me some ice? It *really really* hurts.""&&It's more masky than the first mask&&MORI!!!&&It’s from a video game called Dead by Daylight and Michael Meyers is one of the playable characters in the game as well as Laurie Strode. The survivors which include Laurie, escape the killer by running around the map and throwing down these blockades called pallets. 

Evil Within is the special power that Meyers has in the game where the longer he stalks survivors, the more powerful he becomes. This eventually leads to him being able to kill the survivors quite easily once he gets to Evil Within 3.

Hope that helps!&&The only one I really didnt like was the reality show one.

I'm one of the few who really enjoyed H20.&&Halloween 2: For real this time you guys&&If he disappeared again, that wouldn't be bad.&&IT BROKE NEW GROUND!&&Correct. It was followed by a truly terrible sequel with Buster Rhymes, but H20 itself was decent.&&4 is highly regarded among hardcore Halloween fans but I don't know how people in general feel about it. Deserves more love for sure if they overlook it. One of the darkest and scariest Halloween movies outside of the original. Lots of awesome kills and a terrifying Michael. Danielle Harris was incredible in it too, especially when you consider her age at the time. The ending is one of the best scenes out of any of the movies. It's a shame that they really didn't make use of that ending in the fifth movie, they could have went in so many directions with it. &&Me too, the last 20 minutes of H20 are epic. That's the Laurie we will see the entire movie in this new one. Resurrection is indeed ridiculous but it's fun to watch if you're looking for a laugh and don't take it too seriously. Am I crazy to say I liked the general concept of it though? If it had a darker tone they could have had something there. &&The irony being that Freddy Vs. Jason ended up being the last in the series anyway and they only remade Freddy and Jason.  
So FvJvA could have easily been the last with Ash killing Freddy definitively.   Jason couldn't permanently die because he had to return in the timeline for Jason X. &&Literally any fetish is a thing if you look hard enough online.&&I don't know about that.&&[deleted]&&Michael fake out is essentially a trope at this point I could see this happening for sure&&Oh my god yes. And then it cuts back to the little kid in the bed, *but it's Michael __the whole time__*!&&Busta busta!&&It was a William shatner rubber mask turned inside out.

[edit] Sorry seemed to have posted this more than once&&Mike vs Michael makes the difference to me. && A good example of a generation gap.  When we hear the name, we see the monster, everyone born after 1990ish will picture the comedian.  I think it is also hard for younger generations to perceive a world were movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th were as horrific as it got without being slammed with an X rating.  A movie like Saw or Hostel would have gotten people charged with crimes in the 80's&&""I've got my mojo back, baby, yeah!"" as he decapitates a babysitter.&&“At first I thought you’re  crazy, now I can clearly see your nuts!” ^^^(while wearing no pants)&&""Austin Powers""

""Doc said Mike Myers""

""This is MIKE MYERZ!""

""It should be the Halloween mask!""

""This is a HALLOWEEN MASK!""&&Fun fact: According to Edgar Wright, the scene was originally supposed to have (Halloween) Michael Myers masks but they failed to obtain the rights to the likeness so he called in a favor with Mike Myers and wrote in the Austin Powers masks as well as the gag instead last minute. 

Apparently Mike loved the scene.

That she could run and hide all she wanted, but he would always come for her. He's the bogeyman because you can keep your lights on and pretend that everything's okay, but you know that he's in your closet or under your bed, waiting.

The idea that a child just *becomes* that one night is much scarier than Zombie's attempt at rationalizing it.&&Nick Castle is basically just a cameo, according to what he told journalists when he was on set. ""Look, I’ve come in to do a cameo. Jim is our Michael Myers now.""  
Found that quote on an article interviewing James Jude Courtney (the main guy playing Michael Myers in this movie), and I think it's interesting. He seems to really love and respect the character.

Crimson-stained gold.&&It may not be anything resembling an Oscar winning film, but I'll be damned if it isn't a fun watch.

May as well embrace it.&&Michael may be a serial killing psychopath, but he’s not a racist! &&I'm feelin KINDA woozy ova here&&It's my second favorite after the first one.&&I still can't tell whether it's on par with or better than Scream 2 for me.&&It was. I’m still hoping for a 5th scream! &&Imo, the best Scream movie after the original. Tbh, the reason why it was so good was that it was basically a remake of the original, but nonetheless still a good Scream movie. &&Scream 3 was really the only dud, but the rest are great!&&The scream franchise is my favorite. Scream has been my favorite movie since I first watched it in the theater.  I was thrilled when 4 came out and it far exceeded my expectations. Emma Roberts was perfect. &&Lol she might have lost her marbles by then. &&I understand what you’re saying but I had to look up and realized that H20 is 20 years old.&&But that one doesn't have Busta Rhymes talking about the internet audience and pioneering IRL streaming.&&I wouldn't say it's ridiculous. The storyline is pretty solid. It's the fact that Ressurection went on to say that Michael traded clothes with the security guard and then escaped. They should have let him die with H20. I'm also kind of sad that they are retconning 2.... Granted it did end with him being burned alive.... Not sure how you come back from that one... &&*headbanging ensues*&&Together!

While I enjoy reinvention and exploration, there are things that don't need to be explained away for fan service. No one cares about how Han Solo got the last name Solo and no one gives a shit about why a mental asylum escapee is stalking babysitters.&&Imho Blumhouse should make sequels to all the classics (Friday the 13th, Elm Street) while retconning the mess that is their respective franchises.&&^^some BODY&&YES! Exactly, Bruce was a bit of a bitch to get working properly. 

I also for got Alien, they had to such a shit budget but look at what came out of it! &&Yeah man BWP was rough for me, I lived in deep Wisconsin country. 

I had to sleep next to a fireplace for like a week after watching it. My parents were super pissed. But that memory stuck with me forever. &&Blair Witch only works imo because the audience leaves not knowing what the hell just happened. Not knowing the extent of the witch's powers, or if there even is a witch or some other creature in those woods makes the entire rest of the movie 10x scarier&&Halloween 3?

And 3 as well because eff the haters, that movie is also dark as shit, considering the ending.&&I’ve posted this before, but Halloween 4 was a great film.

It was a Shatner mask/Kirk mask spray painted white.&&He actually prefers to go by the name ""Giancarlo"" Myers now.&&When I hear Mike Myers, I think of the comedian. When I hear Michael Myers, I think of Halloween.&&Yea, but they cut way back on the random titties that add nothing to the plot.

Then look next to it and realize you wrote another book about a fucking murder car. 

Coke man...I gotta try it some time.&&I can’t remember if it was Cujo or the Tommyknockers but there is one he does not recall writing at all.&&I knew he was fucked on something when I read some of his short stories, one of them being about a demonic possessed industrial laundry machine.&&As someone who doesn't follow the movies too much, were they all canon up to this point?

I think I'm dying, man!&&You fuckin' hit me the phone, dick!&&My dad is gonna kill me!&&Zoinks Scoob&&That's what I think too. It was a great return to form for Craven and the series.&&Scream 2 is definitely a better movie imo. While Scream 3 is okay, I definitely think 4 was a step in a better direction for the franchise. &&Yup came out in 1998 and it was the 20 years later then, so the original is now 40 years old this year and Jaime Lee Curtis starred in the original which is amazing.&&Nnnyaaaahhhh!!!!&&That’s what the latest IT did. Several scenes that were in the trailer were different in the movie, it was awesome. &&He fucking earned that one.&&That's why I *really* hated the Rob Zombie remakes. At least the original films added a super natural mythology that was still very mysterious. 

Rob Zombie: ""He's just white trash with 'tard strength.""&&ONCE&&Yeah. That's where all the hate for Halloween 3 comes from. It was actually a pretty good movie in my opinion. But they spent 2 movies building up this awesome antagonist and then in the third movie they went ""ok it's an anthology now!"" So everyone was just disappointed. &&Just noticed blood can be seen on the floor so it’s obviously a body&&For the fanbase.&&It's an honestly fantastic game.

4v1 game, 1 killer vs 4 survivors. Each of the killers and survivors have customizable perks (Survivors can self heal, hide more effectively, save other survivors faster, sprint away. Killers can change the radius at which they are detected, or have crows around the map that detect when a survivor passed nearby, etc).  Each Survivor and Killer has specific abilities custom to them.  (Michael has Evil Within, Freddy pulls people into the dream world. There's an axe throwing russian huntress, a doctor with electroshock, etc).

The idea is for the 4 survivors to power up 5 generators that control the exit gates while avoiding the Killer and trying to not die. The killer's job is to kill the survivors and keep them from powering up the generators to escape. So you get into cat and mouse games where a killer is chasing a survivor while the other three are powering up generators or sabotaging hooks (when a killer catches a survivor, they hang them on a meat hook which bleeds them to death slowly).  Survivors can pull each other off the hooks, but if you get hooked 3 times it's instant-dead.

It's a pretty skill-based game. Different people excel at different killer or survivor playstyles and they're all pretty distinct.  Most games not everybody survives.&&Trick or treat muthafucka&&i'm upvoting every Busta quote. because i still find it unbelievable that someone thought it was a good idea to have him in this franchise &&Also, in the first Halloween, the director had to keep telling the actor ""don't act. Just walk"".

And he isn't credited as Michael Myers. He is credited as ""The Shape"". Which is totally epic.&&In the same vein, the mask worn by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of The Lambs was actually the prototype mask. They were trying to create something really creepy looking but just kept going back to the masks skeleton, and eventually settle on just not doing anything to it at all. Sometimes the more simple and subtle things work the best.&&Pretty much. It was a Shatner mask, made by a company that had taken molds of Shatner's face in order to make prosthesis for an unrelated film.

Carpenter and the producers chose it over some other masks because it had the ""least discernible features"". The production crew removed the eyebrows and sideburns, teased out the hair, ""opened up"" and reshaped the eyes with scissors, then painted it white. At least one of the original masks used during production still exists, but it's in bad shape.

The part about it being turned inside-out is an ""urban myth"", but it's a common one.&&>In 1978, during the making of the original Halloween, the prop department was faced with the daunting task of finding a frightening mask that the villain could wear. Tommy Lee Wallace chose FOUR masks to complete Michael Myers. The first option was a Don Post Emmett Kelly clown mask to which they added frizzy red hair. This would be a callback to how Michael killed his sister, Judith, in a clown costume. They tested it out and it appeared featureless and creepy. The other mask was a 1975 William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk mask that was purchased for around two dollars, a 1975 Mr. Spock mask and a former U.S. president Richard Nixon mask. The Capt. Kirk mask was chosen due to its appearance of having no real facial features that could be easily made out.

SK: what to write next?

*does line of coke*

A shape shifting clown that’s really a spider from another dimension.  Throw in a giant turtle!”&&He has said often that he barely remembers writing Cujo.  &&He also wrote that Elmo Estevez movie with the evil trucks. Everyone gives that movie shit but that soda machine scene was fucking awesome.  &&They were all canon, but not necessarily canon to each other depending on how you look at it. A quick breakdown to hopefully make sense:

* H1-2: Original plus straight sequel. 
* H3: Unrelated spinoff, no Myers
* H4-6: Sequels to 1&2
* H7-8: Sequels to 1&2, retconned/ignored 4-6
* Rob Zombie H1-2: Remakes only canon to each other
* H2018: Sequel to ONLY original H1

I've been watching these movies for 20 years and they all had their charm at the time or growing up. H8 (Resurrection) though is the WORST of the worst. It's unwatchable IMO. Some say the same about Zombie H2. I like it mostly for what it was.&&I love how he has them in their sleeping bags using one like a pillow in a pillow fight to hit the other one. I laughed so hard at that.&&My parents are going to be so mad at meeeeeeee&&It’s like poetry, they rhyme.&&I more or less found it *ok* in the RZ remake. Detached from all expectations of Michael Myers and the Halloween series, it's a fine modern slasher.

It's only once you add those things onto it becomes a question of, was the reinvention worth it?

I would say no, but I do still enjoy the movie enough.&&TOLD ME&&Totally understandable. You can't have two movies about one set of characters and suddenly change it into an anthology on the 3rd.

We should just pretends it's called Season of the Witch.&&Now I want to play Dead by Daylight.  The Shape always snuck up on me.&&Nick Castle. Give the dude credit. &&“The director”...referring to genre icon and one of the best directors of all time, John Carpenter&&/r/LifeHacks&&He directed it. 

He doesn't remember directing it.

Director of photography lost his eye during the making of it cause King insisted using a real lawnmower in a scene for no good reason&&Oh dudeee, Maximum overdrive was like the first horror movie I watched as a kid, I used to have nightmares about it but I loved it, also dat ACDC soundtrack was dope.
I think it's based on his short story called Trucks, it's in the novel Night Shift, I could be wrong on that though.&&The original point of the Halloween franchise was that each iteration was going to be it's own thing. But after H3 the studio execs were like ""what's this? People like Michael Meyers? They're all sequels now!"" &&My memory of that movie is so vague that I can't believe it's real, but I definitely remember that scene. lmao&&He adlibbed that line too. I love Scream. I love all of them actually. &&Every 20th anniversary kind of rhymes with the last one.

Hopefully ""Halloween 2038: Haddonfield Nursing Home"" will work.&&Rob Zombie's films aren't amazing, but when you realize they're made by a metal singer with a love and passion for B-Movies, Grindhouse Cinema, and all things creepy, they become oddly endearing and charming.&&Understandable, sure, but still unfortunate. Having a decent horror anthology every couple years on Halloween would have been great. Especially with John Carpenter being involved. Instead, we got just a bunch of ho hum sequels. &&Is that a good game? I saw it on the Microsoft marketplace the other day and wanted to buy it.&&Okay.

Fun fact: he apparently has a cameo in this upcoming movie.&&I'm pretty sure that King has said that he doesn't remember writing most of Cujo either.

And of course he based the character of Jack Torrance in The Shining partly on himself during his ""addict"" days.&&Haha, yeah. H3 would have been a cult classic had it not used the franchise name too. People receive it fairly well when they actually watch it.&&""Oops.""

""What 'oops'?""

""Nothing!""

""You don't just *say* 'oops', what 'oops'?!""&&I love Matthew Lillard&&Halloween: The Night HE Retired&&I’d watch Michael chase Laurie around a large elderly living community.&&This is how I see it as well. It's a movie made by a guy who is making the movies for *no one* else but himself. I can admire the passion he has for it.&&The Devils Rejects is a straight up classic. &&Good? Debatable. A ton of fun to play for sure. Especially if you have a group to play with. &&As The Shape. &&Yep. Apparently he will play Michael for a scene and then ""pass the torch"" to the stunt man who will play him for the rest. Probably that beginning scene for the facial features.&&Only a person who has known addiction could have described it the way he did for Jack. Jacks mannerisms, internal thoughts, and all around attitude are 100% addiction based. With a little love, sex, and murder thrown in.&&",2018-06-08 10:00:26
