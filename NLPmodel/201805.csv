Oof.

Shia is not fucking around with this. He's got some DEMONS he wants to let out in this movie.

Honestly? I'm actually pretty interested in this movie. Shia, as a whole, has turned from pretentious asshole to someone I am compelled to follow (even if all of his work hasn't been great).&&If you think shia is a weird name, just look at his last name&&[deleted]&&honestly that's a great cast and I'm into it &&Are there any pictures of Lucas Hedges playing Shia Labeouf?&&Probably Eminem.&&At the age of 30 WWII hero Audie Murphy played himself in To Hell and Back in 1955 based on his exploits during the war.

&&Those guys who stopped the terrorists on the train.

And how long to you think Shia has been famous? he has been an actor since 1996 and well known since Even Stevens came out in 2000, so he has been pretty famous for almost 20 years, thats a pretty long time. &&Bieber had 2 biopics.

It make perfect sense for him to play his dad. As we get older, we tend to look more like our parents. I like it.

Edit: and Lucas Hedges is a great young actor. If you haven't seen him in Manchester by the sea, you need to do it today.&&> Sh-sh-sh-shia!

Pocket sand!&&M-m-m-my Shia&&Great actor, but there also aren’t many who look less like Shia.&&You said those three movies, and I immediately know who you were talking about. I remember watching them and thinking, ""Man, this kid is going places."" I had no idea what his name was though until now. &&I never really found him pretentious... just really out there. He never struck me as an elitist or anything. But he has strong views about what he considers art and he likes being unconventional in the way he expresses it.

edit: I didn't know what pretentious actually meant as I was typing this response, so it makes no sense if you use the actual dictionary definition of pretentious: attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.


I thought pretentious basically meant the same thing as being elitist and looking down on other people. But apparently it's just trying to make yourself look better than you are. I'm still not sure I'd call him pretentious though. Just... strange.&&If you think Labeouf is weird, look at his middle name \(Saide\).&&It’s a weird spelling of Leboeuf, which is a French last name and could be translated to Thebeef.

Edit: just looked it up, his dad is of Cajun descent from Louisiana, that makes a lot of sense. Also found out I have the same birthday as him heh.&&I remember seeing Natasha Lyonne in a movie called Slums of Beverly Hills. The movie is 20 years old.

He also killed it at skee ball and defeated like 4 people in row.  He also was posting coordinates on twitter and having people pick him up and when I asked why he said "" I wanted to meet people.""

https://youtu.be/KWZGAExj-es

The first time I watched this video I thought it was weird and saw how some might think it's creepy, but it was such a powerful performance from Shia that I knew there had to be a deeper meaning. Then I researched the meaning, rewatched it, and realized just how truly powerful and emotionally charged it was. 

I suggest everyone watch the video, and then rewatch it after learning the meaning.

**Spoilers**

I'm on mobile and can't find the article, but from what I understand Sia had an alcoholic father growing up, and she had a codependent relationship where she still love him, but still experience the effects of his alcoholism. 

As someone with an addict in the family, several friends in AA, and a copy of the big book for alcoholics given by a former heroin addict friend, the end of the video makes me tear up.&&Shia pet&&I look less like Shia than Lucas Hedges does &&I get what you're saying.

I think, like most child actors, getting famous so early in life fuck with your head. And if this movie is about a drunken, criminal Father then I assume (like most child actors) his life behind the scenes wasn't good. So that factors in to a lot of things.

Like Joaquin Phoenix the stuff he says in interviews or in public ain't a great look into his personality. But I, personally, have enjoyed a lot of the art projects he's done over the years and he's been in some good movies. We just tend to focus more on his asshole nature and the shit movies he's been in.&&He used his fame as a springboard to do a lot of weird art projects awhile ago, that and his method acting stuff made him seem more odd than he probably really is.&&He’s had an extremely rough upbringing. He watched his mother get raped and apparently sleeps with a pistol by his side as often as he can as a result. I’m expecting this movie to be brutal.&&> attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.

No.  He actually possesses the importance, talent, and culture.  He wakes up and says ""I want to be a meme"" and BAM... he's a motherfucking meme.&&If you think Saide is weird, look at Shia LaBeouf&&she says in a WTF episode that her budding career (at the time) was derailed by drugs and partying&&Oh god. I LOVE that movie. It’s seriously underrated.

It was about 2 years from 50 blowing up to Get Rich or Die Trying.&&It's hard to define exactly when 50 Cent became ""famous"". He was big in the New York mixtape scene for several years before his debut album.

Edit: I'll also add that, like 8 Mile, Get Rich or Die Tryin was very loosely based on 50s life, not what anyone would call a biopic. &&Yeah and it was traaaaash. &&It is based on his life though, however loosely&&And a fucking great one at that.

I am balling my face off. I am 35 years old and have 3 years of sobriety under my belt. Thankfully my wife to be was able to pull me through my cage.

Currently my mother is dealing with her own cage. I have a good friend at work I have to get fired because she drinks at work. I am now on the outside of two cages after fighting through mine with my wife. I am emotionally exhausted from seeing two people I love struggle. I know exactly how they feel, I've been there, which makes this so much harder. There is nothing I can do but I can't give up. I know how fucking happy they can be and I can't just watch

Edit: man I thought I had this shit under control but this video wrecked me. I'm not a fan of interpretive dance, but I am now. I have never seen or heard anything that portrayed what this feels like quite like this dance. Thank you&&Just watched. My dad is an alcoholic dying of cirhossis who regrets evwrything he did. Hes sorry, every day. Im balling like a baby. He was a good dad man, he just got trapped. Id give anything to save him, to not watch him leave for the last time when i was 7, to make my mom love him. Id give anything to fix it all. Anything. Sorru, ive been drinking a bit tonight myself. Ill never forget his fsce when he saod goodbye when he left our home. This is exsctly rivht. Thanks for letting me know im not alone, you may have saved my life.&&> This isn't even my favorite role of him as an alcoholic father.

I always liked that video, but rewatching it now with that context definitely gave it a lot more depth. Thank you.&&Wow... I saw this video a long time ago and didn't think anything of it.  I just re-watched it with this point of view it actually made me tear up. Geez I need to spend more time with my kids.&&Damn this man is talented.

It's a beautifully performed depiction of a battle with your personal demons.&&I saw that video when it came out and my first impression was the same as yours, except I didn’t revisit it or tried to understand it. 

Now that you put it this way and I watched it again, this might be the most feels I’ve ever experienced because of Reddit.

______________________________________

It's forgiveness, <name>.  Want to stop dying inside?  Forgive the people that hurt you.

I found peace with my father because I put effort into understanding.  Understanding why, what drove that guy that loved us so much, to be so careless with his actions and tear apart the family he always wished he had.

I found peace with my mother by trying to understand why here, also.  And the foegiveness made the pain start to subside.

I just realized why my brother was this way.  Answers came with , me not running from the feeling and asking why.  

With understanding, comes forgiveness it seems.  Thinking about my life, that was the only answer that ever worked.  I have no idea why I keep battling myself and others .

THEY will never give you closure and satisfaction.  That shit seems to come from within.

Inner strength is what people need.  We are just waiting for someone else to admit something, or forgive us.  That never comes.  It is a hard thing to look at yourself.  Some people are ready, some not.  

We cannot keep suffering because we want something, from someone else.

I've been thinking.  Have a good one.  Good lunch, sir.
&&You’re not alone man.  My #1 goal in life is being the last of my bloodline that dealt with abuse and alcoholism growing up. You can break the cycle.  I can too&&Damn right.

I didn't have much respect for Shia until I saw that. &&I'm so shia lebeouf for you!&&Living in the woods it's Shia labeouf&&Man this is powerful. Isn't it weird how much you can learn and heal from someone dealing with some other kind of pain than yours. Forces your head out of the vicious cycle and makes you realize pain is pain. Hurt is hurt. It doesn't matter where it came from. I resisted going to group therapy when I was first struggling with my PTSD(also war). I felt like nobody else could help because they didn't go through what I did, it was my pain to carry. The first time I did group I got it. Just like I couldn't pull myself out of the hole, neither could someone with the exact same experience. I needed perspective. Nobody shared the exact same experience but we all shared the hurt. 

I do think forgiveness is the last step. Not that it will ever leave me, but at least be able to look at it with a sense of completion. I forgave everyone else pretty easily, it's taken me a while to forgive myself. I think I feel scared that if I stop hurting I will forget the enormity of it all. I'm realizing it's not about hurting, it was about love. I'm sorry for rambling.

You can do that in a movie like this, and still have it be a great musical with fun songs, and have action and all of the other crazy things we’re gonna get into with that movie.

##COME ONE!!##&&watch Arrested Development before the Lego Batman Movie and it sounds like Gob and George-Micheal taking cosplay really seriously&&As a Bojack fan and a Tiffany Haddish fan, I was overjoyed when I read [this](https://www.google.com/amp/deadline.com/2018/02/tiffany-haddish-netflix-tuca-bertie-animated-series-bojack-horseman-producers-1202296575/amp/) &&I hear he was fired for being a cheapy peepy&&It's because he kept schrabbing the movie execs.

Obviously it's not Oscar worthy but with Tim Miller leaving as director there was a chance that the sequel could have felt completely different in a bad way but thankfully with the same writers it felt like a natural sequel with a new director giving his own visual flair. Hopefully that's what happened with The Lego Movie 2.

Sky High was a masterpiece so i'm confident in the new director. &&IMO it really differs from movie to movie...&&same here. got super excited for a second lol&&Mitchy 2-spoons branching to bigger things in 2019&&[deleted]&&Ninjago was so bad because it already had an established storyline and had no need to go the route of The Lego Movie.  It could've and should've been a standalone movie of it's own.&&Ask my 7 year old to rank them best to not quite best and it's:
Ninjago
Batman
Lego movie

I think it's great Lego made a movie just for kids. Not every movie had to have subtle adult in jokes, it can just be a plain kids film.&&Didn’t help that Ninjago was for a specific niche audience, whereas the reach for LEGO and LEGO-Batman were more broad.

Also didn’t help that Ninjago’s release was pushed all around and finally settled for September, when their core family audience are back in school/work.&&Lego Batman Movie made less money than Lego Movie, which stunned me. &&> Ninjago was terrible

It really was.&&The fact I loved the Ninjago movie game, more than the film itself, kind of says something. :/&&I feel Ninjago had a really interesting start that just went nowhere &&LEGO Batman was a HUGE letdown. I thought it was rushed and it felt as though it assumed its own greatness from the word go. &&I think they split focus trying to create a universe. I'm almost positive this franchise would have made more money if they went with Lego Movie 2 first and then branched out.

That being said, I'm really REALLY hoping for a Lego Harry Potter movie. &&I feel it. Both are stuffed to the gills with pop culture references while simultaneously poking fun and paying homage to their subject matter.

Come to think of it, the character development of the protagonists is pretty similar too. They each have very established expectations and break through them, to the astonishment and respect of everyone.&&Especially unikitty. She was a hit from the first movie so im worried they might pull a ""minions"" unikitty already has a tv show standalone too. Hopefully they do good with this.&&New meta twist: the interaction between the son and Will Ferrell at the end was just the son playing with dolls. In the real world Will Ferrell comes downstairs, finds the messed up Lego sets and his son playing with dolls, and beats him mercilessly. The film yoyos between the three levels of reality as the son desperately tries to keep himself in one of the fantasy layers while the father's physical and emotional abuse makes it more and more difficult for him to do so. Eventually he's forced to choose between staying in the fantasy world forever, becoming a non responsive shell of a human in the real world, or abandoning his fantasies entirely to face the hellish real world as it is. The film winds up being a PSA for domestic violence awareness and an exploration of psychological coping strategies human minds can develop in this sort of situation. Many angry parents ask for their money back. &&Very true, and a lesson I have learned the hard way. &&Red Button standing by&&*“You don’t want to settle for sloppy narration. Just pure crap.”*&&::Ukelele plays::&&Saving Technic for the gritty reboot.&&What about MegaBlox?&&I wonder if that means the Lego Friends will make an appearance &&Piece. The Second Piece. An opportunity missed.&&Everything is awesome.&&Some sets for Lego have numbered bags.&&Lego sets come in numbered bags, each bag having the pieces for one ""part"" of the set. So a train station might have one bag for a locomotive, another for a car, and another for the platform. &&And that’s why it’s not called that&&The bricks for Lego sets are arranged into bags for each stage of the build, so you're not overwhelmed by bricks &&Everything is awesome!&&That's what I think they're going for. It's a pun on it being the second movie in the series but also (I presume) there's gonna be be a second piece they need to get control of or whatever (the kragle being the first part, probably).

Is this working?&&They have a Lego Movie 4D show at the local Lego Land discovery center and the bad guy is his little brother, Risky Business. &&I'm sure the studios used Batman and Ninjago to really refine their process - much like Pixar with Incredibles 1-2. In 2 you can really see a decade of CGI improvement and development and process refinement, and I'm sure we'll see something similar with the 2nd Lego movie.&&> only animating movements that could be done by real LEGO pieces

And when they didn’t do that, it was done so subtly that most people didn’t notice. The arms and legs of minifigures often moved in ways that they wouldn’t normally be able to &&That movie's real hilarity is in jokes hidden in small background scenery; Quilt Man pole dancing while Gentlemen Ghost throws money on him, citizens of Gotham rioting in the streets and burning cars to celebrate the end of crime.

Schrab is surrounded by lots of awesome creative people and I think it's time for his unique, otherworldly style to be part of a movie. So far I've only seen it in the Sarah Silverman Program and some Channel 101 shows.&&That's not how you write Cheapy Peepy!&&Also, this show is gonna get dark and very real in the middle.&&If anything the direction in the second movie was superior. The action was done better and it had an actual color palate unlike the wet concrete look the first one had. It had a lot more comedy involving Deadpool doing creative things with his healing factor.

It really made me laugh how Junkie XL made a huge deal over quitting the sequel in solidarity with Tim Miller, because the music was the most forgettable thing about the first movie. Tyler Bates completely blew him out of the water, especially with the choir song during the Colossus fight.&&Deadpool 2 does feel fairly different, but in a good way.

The first film was a revenge story, trying to play up that Deadpool isn't a hero.

The second film focuses on a family theme and has him more of a traditional hero.

The humor remains, but the film isn't just action and comedy.&&I consider the script harder to make than the directing part (obviously directing is hard). Take Ridley Scott, he can visually show a story, but if you have a bad script, it falls apart (looking at you Alien Covenant)&&Sky High was a masterpiece&&I actually think Leitch’s direction was an improvement over Miller’s. He just has a lot more filmmaking experience. The first Deadpool felt like a lot of bog standard “shot reverse-shot”, outside a couple action sequences.&&There’s a reason the original Deadpool movie referred to the writers as the real heroes.&&I get this but why do guys like Martin scorcese, Tarantino, Kubrick, or Wes Anderson consistently make high quality movies?&&Never thought I'd hear anyone refer to Sky High as a 'master piece'&&Sky High was a masterpiece?&&I'm with you, but Lego Batman was still a lot of fun, and had one of my favorite lines in a kids movie:

""My name's Richard, but the kids at the orphanage call me Dick.""

""Yeah, well, kids can be cruel.""&&Lego Batman is a prettier movie - it's one of my go-to recommendations for showing off HDR on UHD Blu-Rays, especially the opening sequence with the plane and a later sequence in the amusement park. I agree it's not as good or as satisfying as the first. I've only heard bad things about Ninjago.&&It wasnt close to The LEGO Movie, but as a huge Batman fan, TLBM was the best DC movie in 9 years.     
     
     

EDIT: I thought ""9 years"" was pretty damn specific, but there seems to be some confusion and some confusing acronyms....

The Dark Knight - (2017-9 =)2008 
&&LEGO Batman almost surpassed the original in my opinion, by being a little less random. It almost felt like a G rated Deadpool, with all the meta references.&&Polar opposite for me. I liked The Lego Movie enough, but Lego Batman is probably the movie I've laughed at most in the past 10 years. &&I'm in the same boat. I actually watched Lego Batman twice without realizing until about halfway through the 2nd viewing that I had already seen it. It's fine, it's just not anything special like The Lego Movie. &&I disagree. It was a great Lego movie and a great Batman movie. The first few minutes might be my favorite interpretation of Batman to date. If you think about it, The Lego Movie was the Lego Batman Movie, and Lego Batman was The Lego Batman Movie 2.&&i liked lego batman more than lego movie. so to each their own, also a big will arnett fan&&I thiught Lego Batman was hilarious, but the story and several of the characters bored me to death&&Lego movie was genuinely a great movie

Lego Batman was temporarily amusing&&Hmmm, I think Lego batman would've worked as a non Lego movie and that meant it's medium was less critical. It could have easily been an animated dramedy.. To me, it was a great homage and satire of batman at the same time, told through Lego. If anything, I dont think the two movies were all that comparable&&As someone who knew nothing of Ninjago's already established storyline going into the film, I enjoyed the design/aesthetic of the characters and their mechs and the fact that it was a satire on Power Rangers.

That being said, I did lose interest about a third of the way into the movie.&&I really liked the Ninjago series too, it's a real shame that they just disregarded it entirely to make that dumb movie&&I was really hoping that Ninjago was going to go the more serious route, a la video game Lego Batman. It would have worked much better. &&I've got a four year old that would feel similarly. Some people seem to have a hard time accepting that not all films are made with the 'Reddit demographic' in mind. I see it all the time here with films targeted at kids or women.

And honestly though I do think it's the weakest of the three I thought there were plenty of moments for an adult to enjoy in Ninjago.&&Either way, The Lego Batman Movie was still the best film featuring Batman of 2017.&&I liked the part with the kitty...&&Her show already flopped months ago and got pulled from the schedule a month back.

EDIT: People who are saying the show is still on the air, note that [it is literally not](https://cnschedulearchive.tumblr.com/image/174094032355). It hasn't aired a substantial amount since April 23rd.&&Didn't the film Sucker Punch do something kind of similar to this?&&/r/jesuschristreddit &&Hahaha. Lego Pan's Labyrinth.&&This sounds like an episode of Community...&&This is why I don't watch movie trailers anymore.  Only if its the occasional short teaser, with just the bare minimum to tell me where the movie is set, when, the genre, lead actors, and a hint to of what the visual style is.  I dont want to hear any dialog, no jokes, nothing dramatic, no plot points or anything.

The I go into the theatre and I'm surprised by everything I see, which by itself makes it more enjoyable.&&Red October shtanding by&&Red Fox standing by&&But what about Bionicle?&&Invaders from another dimension or possibly an alternate reality.

They could also slip in N&B Blocks.&&I mean, it's called ""The Second Part"". I think that's what they were going for.&&Blue Skies&&I think they only started doing this recently. I bought my first set in a decade last year (the Saturn V) and was pleasantly surprised.&&Yeah i love LEGO’s but i Havent played with them since I was a kid. &&Everything is cool when you're part of a team!&&Lego Movie: Tokyo Brick&&Brick it on again.&&and shrek 5

at some point in 2019&&I’m just praying moviepass is still alive at that point so I’m not spending hundreds....&&How did you list dark phoenix but forget Avengers 4 and Shrek 5...also I think Mary Poppins comes out this christmas.&&GOD I LOVE SEQUELS&&Yes.&&Most people probably don’t notice or don’t care. But it’s one of those attention to detail things that makes a difference. The first film truly looked like stop motion legos. The others did not.  &&""This is better than the two boats!""&&All subtle (or not so) long-time Batman references. Like Joker saying they've been fighting for 70 years.&&Billy Dee Williams as Two\-Face after all these years.&&OH&&Probably meant the cancellation sucked, the new figures were vast improvements over the original sets. Though the originals still hold a place in my heart near and dear to me.&&Is it really a crossover when Lego makes Duplo?&&Damn that's unfortunate. I feel like his sense of humor would have been perfect for the film.&&I did. From about 14-22. I'm 40 now, and have one of the big Millennium Falcons waiting to be built.&&I love the scene where (after the snakehole party) Andy is hungover shining shoes and April comes over to him as Janet and starts mumbling nonsense..i wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face hahaha then Andy gets up, sits right back down and pukes on Kyle's shoes 😂&&""Slap me again"" &&It is [literally](https://i.imgur.com/nB6pBzb.jpg) my favorite show of all time.&&In the video, she gets cum on her back.&&It was supposed to be a gamora joke...&&I made a huge mistake&&Enjoy your free mug, ass-dick!!&&I honestly didn't expect to see this many Harmontown references outside our safe place.&&I ACKed that&&Your schrab is better. *fixed &&I’ll do YOU one better, WHY is Gamora? &&Why got booted?&&What number movie in the franchise is that?&&/r/woosh (unless I'm wrong, this guy's [Schrabbing](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=schrabbing))&&Yeah, google Schrabbing.&&You should read his comic book if you haven't already&&> the choir song during the Colossus fight.

Haven't seen DP2 yet and I just got hyped all over again&&Yeah, for real, the direction this time around blew the first out of the water I think. The fights were so much more visceral and physical, and they had a lot of fun with the various powers (Wade strangling Cable with the former's own broken and dislocated arm comes to mind). The choreography and the combination with humour really made it a joy to watch.&&Well to be fair they could spend more on aesthetics because the second one has a much bigger budget.  &&So many people made a fucking stink about Tim Miller leaving. Like, why? There was no character or distinct visual style to the film at all. Could’ve been done by anybody. Leitch, though I’m not a fan of his, has a much more unique vision for his films, which shines through with Deadpool 2.&&Was it better then the 1st one, I found the 1st kind of mediocre.&&Wet concrete look - That’s just how Vancouver looks&&I dunno why they changed how he said Kabob from the trailer to the movie, it made the joke so corny when he put emphasis on it&&Man that song got me soo hyped. I really need the movie version of it though because they give a big spoiler if you haven't seen it&&Junkie XL is just not that good a composer anyways.  The Mad Max score was way overhyped.  It was just Hans Zimmer’s schtick with louder, shittier sounding drums.  If anything his score for Tomb Raider was much better and it still wasn’t anywhere near a standout aspect of the film in the way that scores from other Academy Award Nominee-less composers like Max Richter and Daniel Lopatin (or Tyler Bates like you mentioned) have consistently accomplished.&&I disagree with the Junkie XL point. It may just be because the soundtrack got me through my A Level revision, but if nowt else if he had come back it would have made the flaming dubstep joke make more sense/fit much better into the pacing/overall feel.&&Tyler Bates is probably the worst composer in the business right now.&&The best part about both Deadpool movies is on top of the ridiculous action and humor, it still manages to tell a story that makes you actually feel. The doctor scene from the first, ""she's thinking about plan a, b, all the way through Z. I'm just trying to memorize her face"" hits hard, especially if you've been on either side of the cancer fight &&Ultimately it's how the director brings a script to life and his vision for a project that can make or break a film though. Ridley Scott from 2017 is a very different director to the one who first created Alien, and his vision for the franchise lead to whatever the hell Covenant was. Thank fuck he never directed a Blade Runner sequel, because instead we got Villenueve who had a fantastic vision for the franchise and he was able to execute a stellar script to new heights.&&SIIIIIIIIDEKIIIIIIIICK&&My favorite part of the movie was the edgy character whose father was a villain and whose mother was a hero, and who filled the trope of ""bully with a heart of gold"".

They named him Warren Peace, which is so on-the-nose I can't help but cackle. One of the best names of any character I've seen.&&Sky High was a masterpiece.  &&All of those guys either write, co-write, or have great influence over the scripts. Plus some work with the same writers and crews over and over again to stay consistent. For instance, Scorsese has stated multiple times how important Thelma Schoonmaker, his editor, is to his films. &&I would imagine that, depending on the director, it's a combination of picking good screenplays/good writers, working closely with the writers or simply writing the script themselves.&&It had a surprisingly excellent script. And got to fuck around with batman canon while still paying homage to it in a way no other batman adaptation could.&&I think they threw in a joke about meth at one point. You can get away with a hell of a lot ifyoutalkfastfuckyouandyourfamily&&I'm sorry but that doesn't beat the infamous ""laser envy"" of Toy Story.&&I was pretty fond of, “I like to fight around.”&&> Lego Batman is a prettier movie
But how much of that is because everything in that movie wasn't made of Lego bricks?    The intro scene with the plane does look really good, but the water is made to be real water, not blue clear bricks that you'd use for water.

In the Lego Movie, even the motion blurs added are Lego bricks.
&&I actually feel like Ninjago had more of the feel of the original LEGO movie. Batman was a lot of fun, but it didn’t have quite the same sense of humor as the first one. Ninjago has some more of that. I thought it was enjoyable as long as you don’t take it too seriously, which I don’t think it wants you to. &&The Dark Knight Returns 1 and 2 were pretty good adaptations. Lego Batman was good, sure, but it wasn't as good as those.&&idk, i loved lego movie and was so excited for batman one, but after watching it felt kinda dissapointed. it was like too childish. LM wasnt like that&&Batman was killer for two reasons:

- It's connections to Arrested Development
- It's observations on Batman, DC, and superheroes

If those tickle your fancy, then it was a great movie. I loved it. But I also get why not everybody does. &&[deleted]&&I had the opposite experience. I can’t remember most of the details of the LEGO movie other than Batman and Will Ferrell...and that I wouldn’t have gotten the best Batman movie of all time if not for how well made the LEGO movie was. 

I’m really glad we’re getting more of this universe. &&Yes! I watched LEGO Batman twice without realizing I had already seen it. It’s just so meh. &&Same. I didn't know anything about the brand but still enjoyed the movie. Kind of forgettable but it had a few good gags that made me laugh.&&The fundamental issue with Ninjago is that it's a universe that was originally designed to sell Legos, not movies. Same with Bionicle, which is why I hope they never make that movie.

What they need to do is find their old classics that everyone under the age of 40 remembers playing with, and make a movie about those. For example, [Lego Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Castle) could be used to make a medieval fantasy movie, with room for all kinds of action, characters, monsters, parodies, and humor. 

As long as WB is trying to take existing Lego stories and adapt them to film, it's gonna end up like Ninjago did. Oh well, at least we got [a sweet song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zNjh-24sE) out of it.&&I agree. I think LEGO Batman was so enjoyable because most of the film portrayals of Batman, and especially in the last decade, have been really dark and gritty.

LEGO Batman brought me right back to the silliness of the tv show, and it was wonderful for that.

But it wasn’t a great LEGO movie. But a pretty good Batman film.&&Id go one further and say its the best DC film of this decade. &&Okay, good. I didnt know that. But then again, cartoon network calls anything that isnt teen titans go a flop and already pulled most of its good shows off the schedule.&&Well the tie in Lego sets are only coming out this Summer in stores so expect to see her around for a while longer.&&Never saw that one but IMDB agrees with you. But my idea has Lego!&&It’s damn near the plot of Sucker Punch. Except in that she was in a mental institution, imagining she was in some showgirl/entertainment place, where she imagined multiple scenarios where she had the power to fight back.&&Did Community ever get that dark?&&Red Foreman standing by&&But what about the attack on the Wookies?&&[deleted]&&I want to say it started between 2003 and 2008. I know it was used for Titan Bionicle sets, I just can't remember if it started with the Mask of Light sets or the Mistika titans&&Yeah I don't remember anything about bags.&&Everything is awesome!&&Electric Brickaloo&&Lord Business Strikes Back&&It ain't ogre til it's ogre.&&Fuck yeah, theatres gonna be sold out for months.&&Because those aren't coming out in the beginning of 2019.&&#I'M MARY POPPINS Y'ALL&&hooRAAAAAAAAAAY!&&""Like the time with the parade and the Prince music?""&&Right.

I was laughing so hard. &&Who is Gamora?&&Kiss me, I'm Monday&&What’s the biggie dooey?&&Yeah, I'm not understanding any of these references.&&Right?&&Came here for the Harmontown references
&&> scarab

His what?&&Wait, so you're NOT working for Thanos?&&The second. &&""It's called 'Schrabbing', and all the kids are doing it.""&&I've been meaning to for a while... you know what, I'll stop being a cheapy peepy and buy it now.&&The choir song mentioned is significantly better than you're imagining.&&The soundtrack is awesome! It's all I've been listening to since I saw the movie.&&[deleted]&&In general the first one's fight scenes all felt like pretty generic superhero fights with the humor coming mainly from Deadpool's quips during the fights, while in the second one they made the action as ridiculous as the writing.

I wasn't expecting the sequel to be bad, but I was very surprised that I actually ended up liking it better that the first.  It's rare to see a sequel to an action comedy where both the action and the comedy are more creative than the original.&&Fuck. You just made me realise how brilliant a Villenueve directed Alien movie would be.&&Except Scott also directed The Martian, which was a fantastic film.&&And hopefully Scott doesn't go ahead with the 3rd Blade Runner he has a mind to direct. I doubt Villenueve would return.&&HERO!&&We need a Bruce Campbell Cinematic Universe.&&What ever happened to Danielle Panabaker&&And Sally Menke was hugely important to Tarantino's work. I still enjoy his work, but her passing was definitely noticeable in the editing of his last couple films.&&Did....you make some of those up?

Joker: nope!&&I enjoyed all the slight nods to past Batman movies.  Lots of creative little moments they slipped in there.  ""You wanna get nuts?!""&&Their canon was every joke ever made about batman, and it was hilarious. &&In a way, it captured some character development of Batman better than any other movie could've. Honestly the more I watch it the more I'm convinced it's a masterpiece.&&I'm glad I'm not the only one who was dissapointed that they switched to ""real"" water and other non-LEGO effects.&&That’s the best thing about it. You can pause it anywhere and there’s no actual blur. Just Lego made to look like blur. &&I was talking more about the bright/dark contrast and the colors used. But yes, everything being Lego bricks in the first one is technically astounding.&&Plus I feel like Ninjago was geared to a specific audience. You know...kids that watch Ninjago. My 8 and 6 year old loved it. They also loved the Lego movie. Lego Batman, not so much.&&I'd say I had more fun watching Lego Batman than the Dark Knight series, but it's a sugar/fat comparison, imo. Both are nice, but in different ways.&&I really liked Red Hood as well. Also TDKR was fantastic. I would say best in about 5 years for sure. &&They were good adaptations, but I’ll always take an awesome original take over an incredibly faithful adaptation of a decades old comic. TDKR movies are awesome, but the comic is better imo. &&Those were 9 years ago&&I think he means theatrically released DC movies&&I’ve never seen it but I love AD. What are the connections/allusions?&&Right on, Padre.&&I personally liked it more as a satirical batman film than a Lego film, and for that reason I rank it quite highly, if that makes sense. &&I really loved Batman in the Lego Movie, I just don't think it was enough to support an entire premise on its own. I did enjoy the Batman movie, it just didn't grab me, I'm not sure why. 

I'm also really enjoying the universe. Especially as the mainstream superhero movies are mostly getting so dark and serious. Stuff like the Lego movies is great, and Spiderman Homecoming, and Thor: Ragnarok. I love the fun takes on what I think is a pretty fun subject.&&Well theres been a couple bionicle movies and they were fine, nothing really townrite home about. But theres enough building blocks of lore there to make something better.&&> Same with Bionicle, which is why I hope they never make that movie.

You mean like in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2009. I have seen the first one at least 50 times when I was a kid.&&I was going to bring up The Dark Knight, but then realized that it didn't come out this decade. I feel old now and I agree with you!&&In one timeline it did. &&The ones where Jeff hallucinates about GI Joe and while in an air vent have similar plotlines… just played comedically. There was also the one with Annie in Abed's simulation which was kind of legitimately dark and was actually quite similar to what was described above.&&Dumbass&&Red Dead standing by&&A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.&&This.

The Lego movie made me kind of motion sick in the ocean scenes, although it was cool looking. It opens up alot of opportunity to play with the environment. Plus, if this is in the same universe as the original LEGO Movie, real water isn't too far fetched. I used to play with Lego boats and toys in the tub as a little guy.&&The bricks are 100% CGI but the crew went out of their way to make it look like the real thing. 

You can see the difference in the Lego Movie at the end scene where they show the kid and the lego set-pieces. It helps explain why they didn't opt for something like stop motion. &&It's funny you say that, because I know a lot of kids said ""this isn't Ninjago"" once they heard the celebrity voices and saw how changed Garmodon was.&&I feel like that's who the first half of Ninjago was assumed at, for sure. Once they begin the actual ""quest"" in the movie, it got significantly better, IMO, to the point that the second half felt like a completely different movie. I think the extended action scene that is the first 30+ minutes was meant for all the young franchise fans, while the father/son plot of the back half was meant for parents/older fans.

The result, though, was something I don't think I could ever fully recommend to a fan of the LEGO movie. The first act just drags the whole thing down.&&My kids and I watch Ninjago, it was nothing at all like the TV series. Not even close.

It was a perfectly good superhero setpiece battle and Deadpool's jokes were funny, but it still felt like a lot of parts of it could have just been in any superhero movie.  Deadpool 2 had some action scenes that really felt like a perfect fit for a Deadpool movie (the first Deadpool vs Cable fight you mentioned and the Colossus fight in particular).

In a way, that's just how I felt about a lot of things in the second movie.  The first movie had a lot of parts where what was happening on screen wasn't particularly funny, the humor was in Deadpool's commentary.  In the second one, the story and action were often already funny and then Deadpool's commentary added to it.  I can't barely even think of any jokes from the first one that weren't Deadpool lines - without Deadpool's commentary it would have mostly been a pretty straightforward anti-hero comic book movie - but my favorite jokes in the second movie weren't even from Deadpool himself ([the parachuting scene and the music during the Colossus fight](#spoiler)).&& What about that thing with the two boats? &&It was the low framerate of the ocean that I hated.

>By their extraterritorial nature, film festivals the world over have always permitted works to be shown and for filmmakers to present them freely and safely, even when certain States opposed this. ...

>Filmmakers, actors, producers and technicians — everyone involved in international filmmaking — want him to know that he has their support and friendship.

They claim film festivals and directors are above the law.

This is what Roman Polanski did to a 13-year-old girl:

>[Let's keep](https://web.archive.org/web/20100202110114/https://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/28/polanski_arrest) in mind that Roman Polanski gave a 13-year-old girl a Quaalude and champagne, then raped her ... let's take a moment to recall that according to the victim's grand jury testimony, Roman Polanski instructed her to get into a jacuzzi naked, refused to take her home when she begged to go, began kissing her even though she said no and asked him to stop; performed cunnilingus on her as she said no and asked him to stop; put his penis in her vagina as she said no and asked him to stop; asked if he could penetrate her anally, to which she replied, ""No,"" then went ahead and did it anyway, until he had an orgasm.

Here's how Roman Polanski [defended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case#Conviction_and_flight) himself:

> If I had killed somebody, it wouldn’t have had so much appeal to the press, you see? But… fucking, you see, and the young girls. Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls. Everyone wants to fuck young girls!

-

>[Polanski](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/hollywood-reverence-child-rapist-roman-polanski-convicted-40-years-on-run) recounts what he describes as “making love” so sexily you can practically hear his heavy breathing. “There was no doubt about her experience and lack of inhibition. She spread herself and I entered her. She was not unresponsive,” he writes.

>This is how Gailey recalled the crime: “He placed his penis in my vagina. I was mostly just on and off saying: ‘No, stop.’ But I wasn’t fighting really because there was no one else there and I had no place to go. He didn’t answer me when I said no ... Then he lifted up my legs farther and he went in through my anus.

And just to restore some faith in mankind, [here's a non-exhaustive list who came out *against* Roman Polanski.](https://chrismm.dreamwidth.org/577422.html?view=1709454)

Some of them are pretty waffly. Highlights of those who weren't: Kevin Smith, Greg Grunberg, Jake Tapper, Neil Gaiman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Maher, Drew Carey, Jamie Foxx, Jesse Eisenberg, Howard Stern

It's a low bar, but many have trouble with it.&&41 years too late on Polanski. People have lived, died, and have had children of there own in the span of time that it took for them to expel him. Unreal&&Let’s not forget that Polanski was given an Oscar and a standing ovation at the 2003 Academt Awards, over two decades after he drugged and sodomized a 13-year-old girl. Sorry if I find the Hollywood establishment’s recent coming to Jesus moment to be motivated more by PR than values. &&[deleted]&&Tomorrow all of Hollywood will be congratulating themselves and bragging about how much they protect women and that they're the first to confront bad behavior in the business&&[deleted]&&Cool, now when are they going expel Victor Salva (Directory of Disney film Powder and the Jeepers Creepers franchise which is produced by American Zoetrope, founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas) who was jailed for raping a 12 year-old boy during the making of his film Clownhouse as well as filming the act itself and having a stockpile of other child pornography found in his residence (years before Powder and Jeepers Creepers came out FYI, meaning Disney and George Lucas / Francis Ford Coppola knowingly hired a child rapist for the respective films) and all the other sick pieces of shit still wading around in the film cesspool?&&[Here's the clip of Polanski winning Best Director in 2003](https://youtu.be/PXnNOBj26lk?t=48s). Take note of the ecstatic applause and standing ovations from the very same people that are now suddenly demanding change in Hollywood. Hypocrisy at its finest.

Also incredibly ~~ironic~~ fitting that Harvey Weinstein is one of the people giving a standing ovation.

EDIT: When I first posted this link, you could still comment on the Youtube video. Not anymore lol.&&The fact that it took them this long says everything you need to know about the Academy and what their actual priorities are.  

As if there is anything to suggest they have *ever* given a shit about morality over money.




&&It will be interesting to see how they handle Kevin Spacey. Both Cosby and Polanski have been found guilty of their charges... but Weinstein has not been (yet). So when, if ever, will they expel Spacey?&&The academy is so pathetic. Polanski *NOW*?? They care only for saving face and their own asses. &&It took them this long to expel Roman Polanski... Shame on you FA.&&Both of whom are well past the money making stage of their careers. How about Bryan Singer whose still making all that sweet X-Men money for the studios? <crickets>&&Give Polanski an Oscar and a standing ovation, treat him like a conquering hero even though you know damned well exactly what he did and why he dare not set foot in this country.

A decade and a half later expel him from your membership because, uh, you saw a Twitter hashtag or something? MeToo! TimesUp!

Whatever, Hollywood. We know EXACTLY who you are.

&&While I applaud the Academy's effort to rehabilitate its image, this seems more about optics than real change.

If they were serious, there'd be almost no members left. Remember Whoopy Goldberg's ""but it wasn't *rape* rape"" comment?

There seems to be this attitude of winking and nodding at what is fundamentally the degrading practice of promising jobs in return for sexual favors.

My guess is that it was safe to expel Cosby and Polanski because they were convicted in court. The Academy gets to appear virtuous, no one objects, and nothing else changes.

Edit. Grammar. Stupid mobile Redditing. &&LOL!

That must be one of the most empty gestures I've ever seen.

Expelling Roman Polanski at this point ... that's just hilarious.&&What about the guy that directed Powder?&&I must be living under a rock.  I had no idea so many people supported Polanski, so many people that I (until now) liked.  Oh Natalie Portman..&&LOL!

The fact that Hollywood is only now turning on Polanski, a man they praised as a genius for decades, is one of the most pathetic things I have witnessed in my lifetime. 

Any time celebrities try to preach morality to you always remember what truly lies beneath their facade of virtue&&I'm glad the academy decided to take a stand against rape and pedophilia twenty years after the fact, now that public opinion has turned against the people in question. Truly a paragon of integrity and principle. &&About fucking time. I'm amazed convicted child rapist Polanski was a member until today.&&Awe... Look at Hollywood pretending it cares about rape. So cute. 

Fucking degenerate scum. &&
Oh so now they expel Polanski. 

&&Wow, they are really blazing a trail, aren't they ?  About fucking time, you assholes&&Just getting around to Polanski huh? Way to go academy. &&They gave Polanski an oscar after they knew what he had done. He should have been expelled years ago. They are just covering their asses. Absolutely disgusting.&&Roman Polanski after 40 yrs of knowing what he did?... How brave of them. && No racism here people. It took them decades after a conviction to remove the Jew, a few weeks to remove the black guy. Yup, they're not biased at all&&Took long enough for Polanski&&Polanski should have been expelled a long time ago imo.&&Hollywood is a wicked place run by a cabal for the purpose of turning out entertaining propaganda. 

Bread and circuses. Bread and circuses.&&""Alright well, I suppose if we're going to come down hard on raping women, we should probably also come down hard on raping children."" &&After years of praising Polanski, this feels disingenuous and shitty. &&[deleted]&&Roman Polanski: Absolutely phenomenal director, piece of shit human being. &&fun fact: Rob Lowe was videotaped having sex with a 16 year old girl in 1988 in Atlanta the night before the Democratic National Convention.  He claims he didn't know she was 16.  He had a time out for a couple years, then returned to fame in the West Wing and Parks and Rec.

Other fun fact:  Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy page started a romantic affair in the 1970's with a girl when she was 14.  They hid the relationship, which even by 1970's standards was sketchy.

It's funny to see that even with underage sex, there's an in and out group.  The cool kids get away with it.&&More like 40&&Who is Meryl Streep going to give standing ovations to now?&&[deleted]&&The Academy was likely recognizing his invaluable contributions to Cinema, like Ghost Dad and Leonard Part 6.&&There’s like 6,000 people in the Academy and membership never expires once you’re in.  There are definitely people in there who worked less in film than Cosby&&You just need two current members to sponsor you. He was powerful enough that he could curry those favors pretty easily.&&Hey, what about...

Ghost Dad? 

Jack?

Yeah, you're right.&&I remember accusations about Cosby on the news years ago, but everyone dismissed then as absurd. I'd say it took a while. Not sure why it took Hannibal Burress for everyone to look into it again. I guess maybe because the internet was ubiquitous at that point.

But you're also right, I haven't heard much follow up for Weinstein. Maybe they're still building a case?&&Weren't the Oscars cheering Polanski a few years ago?&&They were probably planning to just expel Cosby and then someone in the office was like ""Yea, before we do that...""&&I assume it's because they just created those standards of conduct in the wake of the Weinstein scandal. It is a bit curious to see where they'll draw a line.&&The more I think about it, I think it was done to prevent charges of racism if they only expelled Cosby. It's not like the Academy were truly offended by Polanski's conviction. It's been 40 years since it was handed down. In that time, they've given him Oscars, standing ovations, signed letters of support, and made documentaries asking the LA DA to drop the charges and allow him back in the country.&&I really enjoyed all the celebrities who defended him but all of a sudden had a change of heart the instant public perception changed.&&Hollywood gave Polanski a STANDING OVATION (caps for WTF) in the early 2000s when he won for the Pianist but couldn't attend.

Amazing people they are. &&Because it wasn't ""rape rape"" per Whoopi Goldberg.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZskUvAGyjQ&&Even more so because they knew of his conviction when they gave him an Oscar for The Pianist...and nearly every powerful person in Hollywood gave him a standing ovation and signed those public letters of support. The question now is are they going to ask for the Oscars back? 

How far back are they going to go? Will they only take action against individuals who have been found guilty in a court of law? Will Cosby be allowed back in the Academy if his conviction is overturned on appeal (which has a very good chance of happening due to the conduct of the judge during the second trial).&&Because if they expelled cosby and not polanski they would be seen as bigger hypocrites than they already are. 

And the shitty thing is that cosby used his status to escape justice (up until this point) but Polanski physically escaped justice by fleeing the country and then you have people like harrison ford defending the rapist which shows you a bit about ingrained the sexual abuse is. 

they are only doing this to save face because the public is hyper aware of it now. 


&&In the words of dock worker Cheech Marin, ""Better late then never."" My only issue is that Polanski was inducted years after it was well know about his sexual deviance.
&&They had their expelling pen out anyways&&EXACTLY, child rapist gets a standing O at the Oscars and NOW they boot him!?!?&&The only reason why they are doing it now is because the verdict of Cosby has been rendered recently (iirc anyway. Haven't been following and really can't care less). They know it'd look real bad if Cosby gets expelled while Polanski stays.

&&They're saving face. Trying to look righteous. Bunch of hypocrites. &&It wasn't rape rape.&&PR it would look bad to kick out Cosby when the Academy had spent decades supporting Polanski.  Plus, I think a younger generation that doesn't venerate Polanski has gained more influence and could boot him.&&So the victim would almost be at retirement age today... Crazy.&&They gave him best director in 2002...&&Polanski has a lot of ""a listers"" support for years, similar to Wienstien difference is there irrefutable proof of Polanskis crimes. look it up its absolutely vile. Im sure they'll change their tunes now though.&&Rose McGowan worked with him knowing what he did. When asked why she worked with him she said it 'was none of her business'. Hypocrites through and through&&Who the heck is Victor Salva?&&Fuck, I paid to see both Powder and Jeepers Creepers.

Yep. That's some fucking hubris.

I feel proud of the others who apologized though, that takes courage. Even more of those who spoke against him since the beginning. Thank god for Neil Gaiman.&&You know you're a cunt when Howard Stern says you've gone too far.&&Meryl Streep is a disgrace. I'm sorry but she really is. And Whoopi Goldberg ... seriously?&&I read an interview with the victim a few years ago and weirdly enough, she's his biggest apologist. I don't know if it's just a way of dealing with the situation but her take was ""really, it was no big deal"". It was surreal to read. &&I like Jamie Foxx in movies, there's stories of him being tough to work with but he seems like a stand up guy in others, i wonder how he is overall.&&Man, so disappointed seeing so many people I admire on that list. But on the other hand, Neil Gaiman is still awesome! &&Obviously Woody Allen would be on that list.

Edit: For those that don't know, Woody Allen is a pedophile who raped one of his daughters and married another.

Edit 2: Lol the apologists are out in force. Guy made some good movies but hes a pedo my dudes.

Edit 3: The distinction that only his wife adopted his new wife is literally the weakest shit I've ever heard... until you bring up they've been together for a long time, thats now the weakest shit I've ever heard.

Luc Besson is also on that list.  Such an honorable guy ...&&Terry Gilliam? Really? 

Fuck. That’s disappointing as hell.

If someone creates a product you enjoy, but they support some fucked up cause, how do you go about reconciling that?

I mean, I like Bruce Willis, so why should he suffer for loss in sales of 12 Monkeys because Terry Gilliam signed a fucked up petition?

Why throw out the baby with the bath water?
&&""Everyone wants to fuck young girls!"" Uhmm... What the fuck? No. Just.... No. I knew he was a horrible piece of shit human being, but this just further proves it. Not that I needed any more proof but yeah.&&Tilda Fucking Swinton supported this piece of shit?!&&> But… fucking, you see, and the young girls. Judges want to fuck young girls.

You know what, I don't doubt this actually, obviously not all judges and possibly not even a majority but given some sentences around child molestation that I have seen it's definitely not unreasonable to think that a not so insignificant number of judges want to fuck young girls.

The thing is though that all of that is irrelevant when it comes to his own actions being illegal and horrible. ""But they did it too!"" is not a defense, it's not a justification, it's just trying to weasel your way out of taking responsibility for your own shitty actions.&&[deleted]&&Am I witnessing the r/bestof right now. &&I love how this list shows Howard Stern as having more integrety than Salman Rushdie.&&Woody Allen.

Lots of work to do, our society is not as advanced as we would ALL like to think, eh ?&&Was that for *The Pianist*? Ignoring Polanski, I adored that film. Adrian Brody was fantastic in it. &&I recall that some of the audience at that ceremony refused to applaud, while others took the middle path of politely applauding but not standing (I think Spielberg did this, iirc).

Forgive me for doubting hollywood's ethics and sincerity on this one .&&A good start would definitely be to get rid of the high profile child rapists though, no?&&> If they were serious, there'd be almost no members left. Remember Whoopy Goldberg's ""but it wasn't rape rape"" comment?

Are you implying Whoopi should be kicked out for that comment?  It's stupid, but saying stupid shit shouldn't be a bannable offence. &&I'd say ""convicted in court"" is a pretty fair bar. Hollywood more than any other industry is largely at the mercy of public opinion, which is far more reactionary and easily manipulated than the court system. If they made it their standard that you're kicked out any time you say some dumb shit in an interview, Hollywood would be a ghost town in a matter of weeks. &&No one cares about Victor Salva at this point.

Rob Lowe was 22 so it isn't like he is some creepy old guy preying on young girls.  &&>Rob Lowe was videotaped having sex with a 16 year old girl in 1988 in Atlanta

I'm not sure about 1988, but the age of consent in Georgia as of today is 16&&Well the age of consent is 16 in Georgia and almost all of the western world. Not saying it's not creepy but legal consensual sex is a whole different ball game. &&The girl Lowe bang also gave permission (I don't mean age of consent, just willingness).

Polanski drugged his victim.&&Having sex with a 16 year old is legal in Atlanta. And also in most places.

It's not the most depraved thing ever. &&Not just the cool kids. 24 year olds having sex with 16 year olds happens all the time.

Talk about a great effort versus results ratio.&&> I remember accusations about Cosby on the news years ago, but everyone dismissed then as absurd. I'd say it took a while.

Accusations alone should never result in negative action. No one acting on them **is a good thing**

After you are proven guilty though, then let the floodgates free.


**If you were accused of a crime, you would want the benefit of the doubt before people start tearing your life apart.**&&Also a huge change of guard, there was a large turnover in the Academy in the last few years (the #OscarsSoWhite is what you can thank for that) so less typical Oscar bait would win awards. This is why the Academy has surprised us and given BP to gay black teenagers and fish fucking and why Jordan Peele won a writing award for a horror movie.

Probably younger members putting pressure on older members.&&I guess raping kids is okay but grown women is crossing the line.&&Better horribly late than absolutely never I guess?

And it'll be interesting if they shine a light on the whole Polanski scandal with how Hollywood's changed colors lately. Public witch trials aren't great but it would be interesting to hear some of his defenders reflect on their views today.&&Also, the people running the Academy now aren't the same ones who were running it in the 1970s.

People tend to treat institutions and corporations as though they're a single person, with consistent motivations, but the people making decisions for those institutions change over time \(and even at one given moment, not everyone at the top is likely to agree on everything\). The Polanski scandal apparently wasn't a dealbreaker to the people running the Academy 40 years ago, but most likely, as various new personnel moved up over the decades, no one was motivated enough to rock the boat and bring up an old sex scandal from decades past. It's kind of similar to the bystander effect: ""no one else seems to care about this old scandal, why should I bother to bring it up now?""

But now that the whole #MeToo movement and the Weinstein and Cosby scandals have put this issue in the spotlight \-\- and, more immediately, the Cosby conviction was something on their plate *right now* \-\- they have a motivation to revisit the issue. I can't really blame the people kicking him out today for a completely different group of people not doing anything about it 40 years ago.&&Also, Polanski is 85, I am guessing his ""cohort"" of actors and filmmakers (who tends to side with him) are dying and retiring.

And also, maybe Polanski himself has long outlived his usefulness. He is so well past his prime that there is no more box office cash or art-circuit prestige that the executives can squeeze out of him.&&""To our members, don't drug and then rape 13 year old girls anymore. It's 2018 and people today don't look past this sort of stuff. Thank you.""&&You know that someone, somewhere is trying to defend Polanski with some domino effect/slippery slope bullshit.

""If we start kicking out the rapists then where does it end? Do we kick out the molesters and the physical abusers too?!?!""

Well, I mean ideally... Yes?

**Addendum:** Polanski can teach a lot about film, but what I'm saying is that while you can learn from him artistically, his actions should exclude his from being rewarded. You can recognise his talent without rewarding him. We teach children about consequences, and the consequences of his actions should be a lack of awards and accolades.  &&This was also questioned as soon as they tossed out Weinstein&&Yeah, it was 100% to avoid charges of racism. Otherwise it would have been done before. Hollywood is full of hypocrites like the rest of the world.&&Ding ding ding. The hypocrisy is infuriating, but not surprising.&&[deleted]&&Meryl fucking Streep&&Don’t forget “It wasn’t rape, rape” Whoopi Goldberg.

Then again, it took until the unsealed deposition came out for her to turn on Cosby.&&Wow, Sister Act 3 sucks.&&Jesus Christ, listening to her made me throw up in my mouth a little.&&> nearly every powerful person in Hollywood gave him a standing ovation and signed those public letters of support

Well, there were some notable exceptions. The following year a famous Hollywood actor became Governor of California and refused to pardon him.&&> Will they only take action against individuals who have been found guilty in a court of law?

I doubt they care too much about that. It's about public opinion, what looks good. 

Might be wrong.&&""he says the Titanic just arrived...""&&Oh for sure. I’m just saying Polanski should have been out already.&&>  I think a younger generation that doesn't venerate Polanski

I'm not sure that generation exists. If you're a cinephile, you likely adore the work of Polanski. He is without question one of the greatest filmmakers in history. 

I would argue it's more that people are realizing that while they may love the work of an artist, they don't necessarily have to support that artists career.&&She has done at least one AMA. Very interesting. She holds no ill will and wishes everyone would just drop it and let him live his life. &&She’s s fucking piece of trash for not calling him out. Guess her career was more important. &&> Who the heck is Victor Salva?

A director with an awesome publicist, apparently..

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva

> In 1988, Salva was convicted of sexual misconduct with one of Clownhouse's underage stars – a 12-year-old boy – including videotaping one of the encounters.[5] Commercial videotapes and magazines containing child pornography were also found in his home.[5] Salva pleaded guilty to lewd and lascivious conduct, oral sex with a person under 14, and procuring a child for pornography.[5][6] He was sentenced to three years in state prison, of which he served 15 months.[3] He completed his parole in 1992.[6]

Served 15 months in prison for fucking a 12 year old boy and filming it. But then went on to make the films Powder, Jeepers Creepers 1-3, and others. 

Regarding Powder:

> The film's production by Disney resulted in a controversy over the choice of writer-director Victor Salva, who had been convicted of molesting a 12-year-old child actor during the production of his previous film, Clownhouse (1988). He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and released after 15 months. Disney officials reported that they learned of Salva's crime only after production of Powder had begun, and stressed that there were no minors on the set for the film

If you believe that bullshit, I have a bridge to sell you. Of course Disney knew about it. They only “learned” about it after someone brought it up. 

There are rapists like Cosby and Weinstein, and we all hate those guys. But what Salva did is just another kind of evil. And he keeps getting work, flying under the radar. Maybe if he was worth a few hundred million, there would be outrage.

Fuck anyone who has agreed to work with him since his conviction.  
&&The person Polanski raped is older than my dad. Seems like they might have dragged their feet a little bit on that one.&&Yes, rapes plural. People often forget (or never knew) that he has since gone on to fuck at least four other teenage girls (aged 15-16) while living in France.

-

>Samantha had hurried out before he did. “I was sitting in the car and I was crying,” Gailey testified. According to Polanski, Samantha “talked a lot during the drive home” and mentioned that she was studying “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in school. “I tried not to wince when she started spouting Shakespeare in a strong Valley accent.”

He runs the gammut when it comes to movies, You will see him in a comedy one year and a very serious role the next, then he will play one in between.

It could be when he is difficult he is in the mindset of being serious for the scene and wants to get it right.

But membership in the Academy, like with any organization, is an endorsement of the person more than of their work.  That’s where they should have considered the moral side of things. &&I acknowledged this but, as I said, Weinstein hasn't been put on trial either and the Academy booted him so what I'm wondering is where that line is? Is it because Spacey is a movie star instead of ""just"" a producer like Weinstein? Is it because Weinstein's accusers were more high-profile?&&Kevin Spacey himself said that he probably did it.&&No. I'm showing an attitude. &&Yeah, thats not a bad apology.  Still kind of miffed about her though.

I wish Dave Grohl would apologize for his ""HIV isn't real"" comments though..&&Yeah it was gross. 

Streep would clearly sell her soul for a little bit of attention/relevance.&&Totally agree.  I never like to see Rob Lowe’s name lumped in with fucking rapists.  He didn’t rape anyone.  He had consensual sex with someone that he claims he didn’t know was underage.  Considering he met her at a bar I think it’s safe to assume that he really didn’t think she was 16.  And again.. consensual.  What Roman Polanski did was anything but consensual.  To put them into the same category is a fucking disgrace.  &&Context saves the day once more. Also, 16 is legal in some states. Not sure about GA, but possibly.

Someone I know also got out of a Statutory rape conviction cause he had proof she lied to him about her age. So it became apparent that she deceived him.&&[It seems it was 14 at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe)&&Age of Consent in Georgia was 14 at the time.  On top of that, *he met her in a bar and she told him she was 21.* He himself was 22 at the time.  He had every reason to believe that she was carded at the door, and was of an age with him.

Even if folks think that it’s skeevy, It’s nowhere even near the same ballpark as what Cosby and Polanski did.&&I'm guessing they had to expel Cosby or it would mean a big series of articles against them. Roman Polanski himself hasn't been ""news"" for decades but if they expelled Cosby but not Polanski they'd be accused of racism and it would mean another series of articles against them. Can't have that. Completely calculated. &&Exactly. Will go even further and say these guys are taking more than they are bringing at this point via royalties earned.

Later I learned that ""Seal Team Six,"" the elite crew of soldiers that hunted down and killed Osama Bin Laden used this exact same tactic. Naming themselves ""Seal Team Six"" so enemies would think there were at least 5 other elite squads out there doing cool shit. &&Also is a pretty impressive counter-argument to all these people in showbusiness who said 'yeah, I knew, everyone knew - but what could *I* have done... what would *my* voice have changed'.

the funny thing is, the fact that it was public knowledge was part of the joke.&&Burress has been making these jokes for years. Even when he was writing for tv shows he had slipped some in. There’s a joke about Bill Cosby drugging Tracey Jordan’s aunt in 30 Rock, and that’s why he hated him.

There was also a joke were Jenna says she successfully turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on 2 out of 5 occasions.&&Sure - don't act preemptively. But do actually investigate. Mutliple women came out and said he assualted them. Someone should have checked into that, and they didn't.&&I don't think you meant it this way- but when you say 'no one acting on them is a good thing' you don't also mean, that no one should investigate right? Cause police investigating an accusation is a pretty important action that should occur.&&I have been accused of a crime I did not commit, so I get the gist of what you're saying, but I'm forced to wonder where we draw a line.

If only one person is accusing you, okay, yeah, we should probably take a couple of steps back and let the professionals work.  What about two?  Three?  Sixty?  That's how many women accused Cosby, and the only reason a single one of them was able to move forward with charges is because Pennsylvania had an unusually long statute of limitations (12 years to the normal 10).  Less than a month later on filing charges, and she'd be SoL, too.

Personally, at two unconnected people, I'm getting reluctant, and at three, I'm out.  It doesn't really matter what a court says, at that point, there's just too much smoke.

Maybe you draw your lines differently than I do, and that's okay.  But I've seen people screeching about innocent until proven guilty after seven, and at that point, I gotta wonder not just about the rapist, but the people defending them.&&> given BP

Jodie Foster

I believe these people should be named and shamed alongside Polanki.

If there was actual ‘grooming’ happening, this wasn’t it, and I haven’t heard a case for it.  She (probably unintentionally) helped enable him by her presence and affiliation though, absolutely. &&Yeah that's not true. The actress said seeing Oprah with Weinstein and the way she acted made him seem acceptable. Not that Oprah groomed her.

Always do your own research kids&&No, this is propaganda. I wanted to see this for myself and the only sources i could find that claimed the actress Noble said that Oprah groomed her for Weinstein was from crackpot sites including infowars. [Weinstein just introduced Noble to Oprah at an after party](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-weinstein-assault-lawsuit-20171128-story.html). It looks like Weinstein used Oprah to star struck the actress, but Oprah was not a participant of grooming in this case. &&He said he didn't remember it one way or the other.&&That's a weird gray area of the law. I know here (Iowa) the age of consent is 16 and therefore it is legal to have relations with someone, while technically they're a minor. But the act if video taping the encounter enters the illegality of it. Lowe could have done his business and quite possibly gone untouched but the second any type of documentation is done, be it film or photography, he's broken the law. 

Again, in Iowa it's 16. I know a guy who had a sexual relationship with a ""consenting"" 16 year old but he took photos of the incident and while he was incarcerated for other issues this was discovered and he got popped for 16 counts of possession of photography of a minor engaged in a sexual act. &&Remember when guys like Martin Scorsese were defending Roman, saying he no longer deserved punishment because he’s contributed so much to modern film?&&Art&&I did it for Leonard, not Bill that rapist.&&Mother, Jugs & Speed?

Why single Streep out over say, Martin Scorsese?&&> Wasn't there a delibate effort recently to bring in some new faces

I could be wrong, but her excuse was that people who she respected signed so she did too. Still, not a valid excuse.&&Actually Woody Allen was investigated and cleared twice.

On the one hand we simply cannot encourage this sort of behavior in anyone. On the other hand, if we go back through history and purge every piece of art by ever evil man I believe our culture we be far poorer for it.

Even asides from that, any intoxicants (alcohol or other drugs) are liable to affect the ability to provide meaningful informed consent.

It's just generally a good rule to avoid fucking drunk/drugged people.  
The potential negative is less sex, the positive is that you don't ""accidentally"" rape someone.

&nbsp;

The way Polanski's actions were described indicates that he was predatory as fuck, but the pattern of behaviour unfortunately doesn't strike me as that unusual; I've personally witnessed men talk about providing (particularly young) women with alcohol until they're ""drunk enough"" (generally whilst the man in question remains relatively sober) to concede to sexual activity.  

I'm also aware of instances where illicit drugs were acquired with similar intent.  

(When some reference a ""rape culture"", those attitudes and actions, and the fact that most other people in the group do not tend to speak out, are what they mean.  
In the instances I've referenced, generally someone *was* keeping an eye out, but unfortunately that's not always the case.  
If you're ever at a party or any event where alcohol is flowing or drugs are being taken, just try to be mindful and if you see something that seems shady then please speak up or do something about it.)&&True that. &&All that time, we didn’t realize there was a comma in the phrase, “This is our happy little secret, fern.”&&Honestly i think it is more about internet and how information is so easy to reach and follow. News didnt give us ""daily reminder"" on those cases but now i see this as i scroll and look into it. 

We dont really need to rely on a limited source of news, everyone can look up everything and public opinion matters a whole lot more because of that. Now i can write ""X did this thing"" on Twitter and reach to millions and see a bunch of opinions, the impact is way more than it used to be.&&Here is my opinion; if you are going to judge someone's art work on their person life than are you going to research everyone in the credits to make sure you approve of the way they live their personal life? I'm not. I never saw a Polanski film, but I wouldn't let his past influence my enjoyment of the movie. Just because I think he is a piece of shit doesn't mean I can't enjoy his art.

  


  


A lot of artist are fucked up. If I build a morality fence around my enjoyment than there won't be a lot of art I enjoy.

  


Of course everyone has a line. Just because my line hasn't been crossed doesn't mean that yours hasn't. This is a personal decision everyone needs to make on their own.&&If it helps you, I remember Polanski's victim herself doing an AMA on Reddit and saying that she was in favor of separating an artist from their art and didn't condemn Polansky's films just because of what he himself did.

I don't condemn people who refuse to support someone's work if the artist themself is a scumbag, but I also think.it's okay to appreciate a great work of art even if the person who created it is horrible.&&Talented people can do terrible things and Polanski is how we ended up with Wienstein.  In the entertainment business you look the other way when your career can be helped by working with morally bankrupt people.

It's a world based on the superficial; image, then money and finally talent.  &&TIL Chris Brown music is incredible.....&&Also R. Kelly&&This is what I’m curious about. How is Chris Brown still allowed to have a career in today’s politics. &&He's still a piece of shit though.&&He treated her like dog shit. Cheated on her constantly and insulted her in the media often. He was with some other chick when she was killed. He only seemed to care after her death. Her life was much rougher than his.&&It’s just point to a fundamental human problem that we are sometimes bad at separating an individual’s good world from their evil side. 

Polanski is an objectively good director, wth several acclaimed films. His peers only focus on this, and not the part where he is a horrible person.&&It might have something to do with the fact that he’s a Holocaust survivor whose wife was murdered by Charles Manson. That’s not to say that he deserves to be pitied, but I’d imagine that likely played a part in him not being blacklisted. &&> i meant by his peers and the media. and even the plea deal he struck at the time was a sweetheart deal.

IIRC the reason he fled was because he was either tipped of about, or just suspected that the judge involved in the case wasn't going to accept a plea deal. The deal wasn't official yet, it had been offered and accepted by him, but the judge still needed to sign it, and they don't *have* to do that. &&",2018-05-03 14:26:02

This won't be the best movie in the world. *This is just a tribute...*&&I really hope this film comes to pass, the first film held a special place in my formative years and I'd love to see a sequel.&&One of my biggest achievements in life is handing my joint to Kyle Gass in Flagstaff AZ and him saying “that’s good shit” then walking off with the remainder of my joint. &&Here's hoping to another album with it. The D will rize again. &&Long ass fucking time ago in a town called Kickapoo....&&Nice.

>It’s a post-apocalyptic musical comedy

Metalocalypse with extra fligu gigus?&&It is amazing that the original film was never released on Blu-ray &&Holy shit I was singing kickapoo to myself as I opened the front page, did I accidentally summon the d?&&So I literally found out about Tenacious D this year for some reason and didn't even know a movie existed.

I know what I'm doing tomorrow.&&The twist: it's part of the Cloverfield universe &&If this is true then I'll be celebrating by doing a cock push up. .... It really hurts my cock tho.&&I was at this show and to be honest I couldn't tell if he was messing with us or not. If it's really happening, then I couldn't be more excited.&&Fuck ^^Y ^e a a a ^a ^^a ^^^a ^^^^a ^^^^^h&&[deleted]&&I heard musician Christopher Cross will be playing both lead roles.
https://i.imgur.com/gwSDTiT.jpg&&Yes.&&I have ass mark too&&JUICY&&There should be a scene where jb and kg trip nuts and see the guys from dethklok &&Awesome. I was late to Pick of Destiny but it was exactly what I wanted/expected from a Tenacious D movie. Good to see a sequel&&Come over here I am going to fuck you up.

No, We're  not coming over there.&&""You guys got any new material?""

""What we got's gonna turn your brain into shit!""&&Time to get some new D tattoos!!&&I played Guitar Hero: Aerosmith as a boy, in that game there is a song called *The Metal* by Tenacious D.

I loved this song.

Consequentially I downloaded this song as well as every song on The Pick of Destiny album, and for a while I assumed The Pick of Destiny was just an album by the band Tenacious D which Jack Black (who I knew from Nacho Libre) was a part of. I listened to The Pick of Destiny regularly through my adolescence and eventually came to know every song by heart.

It turns out The Pick of Destiny is also a movie, and the songs are all from the movie, I didn’t know that until I was listening to it in the car and my friend said “I love that movie!”.

And so as an adult I watched The Pick of Destiny, reminiscing over what is at this point my decade long love affair with The Pick of Destiny. 

I’m so hyped!&&I had a choice for my birthday when I was in high school, watch 300 or watch the Pick of Destiny. I chose the Pick of Destiny. The first movie I ever saw in theaters was also a Jack Black film called School of Rock. I fucking love Jack Black.&&Kyle must be out of money. &&Yeeeeeessssssss. POD is one of those movies that I just can’t ever get tired of &&It’s gonna be okay at best. Sorry but Anchorman 2, Zoolander 2, Dumb and Dumber To, and Supertroopers 2 have left me jaded to comedy sequels. Enjoy it for what it is but don’t get hopes up.&&What button do I hit to like this 10000 times &&Awesome. I need more of the creepy Tim Robbins drifter in my life. &&[""Two air vents, on the roof, that's what the guy was talking a-*shit*!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx5H_jJEdDA)&&You're my wittle baby Sas.&&My tenacious D tattoo will become relevant again &&Surprised they are making another one, when the Pick of Destiny was released it was a bomb&&Holy moses! My only request is bring back Ben Stiller and those sick chops (referring to his acting as well as that sweet, sweet face mullet.)&&10+ years later comedy sequels kinda got a bad track record so I'd hope they just ignore the first one.&&and if you say we do not ride...ill turn ya fuckin hide. ride!&&This is blowing my mind!!!&&Does that mean a new album as well?
Because i've been craving some more tenac for years&&My name is j.ables on all my “whatever” paperwork so people call me jables. Since this movie came out...I am now a poser

LASER BEAMS&&Rig-a-goo-goo! Rig-a-goo-goo!&&/nerd 

The pick of Destiny was meant to be part one of a trilogy and he tour was meant to be a victory tour but when the pick of Destiny failed that plan went out of the window.

The documentary included on their ""The Complete Master Works 2"" DVD goes into it as the documentary was meant to be celebration but instead has footage of Jack black breaking down and him and Kyle almost getting into a fucking fist fight and their relationship breaking down because of the fame of Jack and how much he is getting ignored.

Either way I'm excited.&&This is the best day of my life.&&Who?&&Am I the only one who realized he left out the only other rock opera in existence? 2112 By Rush....&&Just as I was about to laser off The D tattoo&&Juicy.&&Dude, I totally miss them.&&This whole thread is just quoting Tenacious D songs and it is glorious.&&If you look at what you have in life, you’ll always have more. If you look at what you don’t have in life, you’ll never have enough.&&I think he’s got a very special energy to him, and we like that about him. It doesn’t guarantee the success of his movies or products, but it guarantees Jack Black is Jack Black. 

Among other attributes, his style is super energetic, a bit random/geeky with a touch of self deprecation. It’s take it or leave it, but to me he’s awesome.&&The line right before that says it's set for October, and while I agree with you, I'm too excited for October to not clarify for you lol&&Dont care what anyone says school of rock was excellent
&&As a huge fan (possibly love knife material), this is a cream dream! &&>> I don’t know where you’ll be able to see it, but we have decided that it’s happening and it’s coming out.

Netflix?
&&afaik he is still one of their drummers \(mostly just for song recordings and special live events\) so if they have the devil I'm sure it will be him.&&""I'm the devil I can do what I want,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLr8gnYpVsg&&And Tim Robbins as The Stranger!&&And SASQUATCH!!!&&Dio returning as dio would be cool too ._.&&Just saw him and Foo Fighters a few nights ago playing a rescheduled show.

The original show scheduled in October was cancelled only 4 or 5 hours before they were supposed to play. Grohl clearly felt the need to make it up. They played for about 2.5 hours that night and he never took his foot off the gas. It was incredible. One of the better shows I've seen.&&I think this should go without saying. 

Otherwise, it'd be ""fucking lame"".&&Dave Grohl is my absolute favorite musician. I've never heard anything about him other than him being just that most stand up and down to earth dude, and he's talented as fuck &&I feel like he might do it! &&Please have Dave, even a tree prop I would be content&&That needs to be the plot. Just Satan trying to get into Kage the (w)hole flick.&&And John C Reilly as Sasquatch...&&No love for Paul F Tompkins being ""pre-satan""?&&PFT&&You know his coming back for his horn, brah.

I mean, the “Bong of Destiny”, not horn.
I foresee something similar to the Sasquatch scene in the first film, but with Kage (or both of them?) being introduced to the horrors of Hell.

&&I've seen this movie 20\-30 times and I never realized Grohl was the devil.

That makes his performance that much better to me.&&People: ""I hate when sequels retread the same things from the first movie, ugh.""

But I'm sure it wouldn't be that cool to see him again doing the same stuff and basically parodying himself. I prefer if they create something new but with the same style.&&These lyrics don't make sense, think I found the evidence - - that yeti is my pa-pa and he's got to pro-tect - - ME&&I feel like it will be the dumbest movie you've seen 163 times soon...

Sure it’s dumb as shit, but it is also fucking hilarious. &&**I did not mean**

*He did not mean*

**To blow your mind**

*Blow your mind*

**But that shit happens to me all the tiiiiiiiiiime**&&[Ooooohh-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH-YAAAAH!](https://youtu.be/buFkkH75EKs)

....sorry.&&[I remember seeing them play this on Conan before it came out (I think!) and getting really excited :)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=mQUVwbzmwFw)&&Well now I'm off to listen to Master Exploder on YouTube.&&It's Dewey all over again. He's got to do it now he's said it.&&Yep, same. KG all but confirmed it was an off-the -cuff joke by saying something ""that's news to me.""&&Don't you do this to me!&&This should be the top comment. It was almost definitely a joke to lead into the song pick of destiny.&&Came here just to say that. KG said it was news to him. &&I was too and thought the same thing. He said it would come out in five months. Don't think that's happening.&&Well Kyle did also say a new album that may be coming next year.  I think it just depends on whether or not they have a camera around.

*I just imagined them doing some sort of Spinal Tap-ish over-the-top mockumentary of them making their album and how utterly amazing it would be.  &&I was there and I was positive he was serious. And I say that with no evidence other than the fact that I was happy to hear it and I want it to be true.&&I'm not so sure they mentioned that they would be releasing an album over a year ago [here](https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/835765/Tenacious-D-new-album-Kyle-Gass-Band-Jack-Black-Thundering-Herd-Rize-of-the-Fenix). With an accompanying animated series that would be “a little post-apocalyptic adventure.” &&This needs to be higher up. It seemed like part of their stage banter before the song. When Jack was being a dick to the roadie before Roadie, I didn’t think he was actually trying to be a dick to the guy. Or when Kyle stormed off stage and JB played Dude (I Totally Miss You). I took them as just lead ins for the songs. &&But you can only really do one I thought.&&I was at the show, too, and I took him at his word. Have I been duped??&&Knowing jack black he was probably originally kidding. 

But seeing the community response to it, he will probably do it.&&I used to take lessons from their electric guitarist, john konesky, and I asked him last year if he had any updates on the D that he was allowed to give me. He said that the next D album will have a ""visual aspect"" to it.&&Same but I really want to believe. It probably wouldn't be a feature film but any new content is great.&&FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK&&Wonderboy, what is the secret of your power?&&...with mind bullets!!&&POD was essentially a movie-length telling of Tribute. A Wonderboy movie would be mindblowing.

Unpopular opinion, I like Wonderboy better than Tribute.&&Oh man...That'd be wonderul haha&&Welp, I'd managed to not have that song stuck in my head for oh, about 5 years now *shakes fist*&&Guys you gotta believe this guy&&If this were the entire script of the movie, I'd be ok with it. &&Couldn't remember the greatest movie in the world&&If they don't start with this song, I'll be so disappointed. They set it up perfectly at the end of the first movie and never sang it. It'd be great to have the movie start with a recap using Tribute.&&I almost cried when I broke my LG Tribute. I got a custom case for with the Devil and ""This is not the greatest phone in the world, this is just a Tribute!"" I was so excited! Then I got on the bus and the black man next to me said, ""Hey we've got the same phones!"" and I gleefully showed him my case... to be met with a blank stare.  
Not many people ""got it"" but I did and that is what was important :I&&Sounds like it's definitely on its way! I agree, as flawed as it was I've seen it loads, listened to the soundtrack countless times and can recite most of the songs from memory (Kickapoo and Beelzeboss are great). Jack Black has such a unique and brilliant voice.&&Totally agree. The first movie was the funniest shit I'd ever seen back then. I was shocked to learn it was a huge failure later on.&&It's the only movie to nearly make me piss myself. I was a bit high when I watched it. And the part where he's tripping in the woods, specifically when he's in the river and it flashes back to reality where he's just in a raging river giggling to himself as he is nearly drowned. Holy shit I laughed so hard. I actually had to go to the bathroom to piss I was so certain I was going to go in my pants. &&I was at their Shaky Knees show yesterday and they both seemed really set on it. They kept saying it's coming out in ""mutherfucking Rocktober"" &&YouTube “Tenacious D HBO episodes. They are awesome &&They better use the bong of destiny in the new one&&Holy shit&&Mine would be asking KG if I could rub the top of his head and him saying yes. &&haha I have met KG twice and I can confirm that he does this&&[deleted]&&The article says they have a new album releasing this year but no confirmation on if it's the one they are gonna use in the movie&&JUST LIKE THE FENIX&&THERE LIVED A HUMBLE FAMILY, RELIGIOUS THROUGH & THROUGH..

but yae there was a black sheep, and he knew just what to do...&&This was always my fav. Tenacious D song. It just totally rocks and the Dio and MeatLoaf parts are eternally glorious.&&Didn't Jack Black make a video game with this plot?&&God it better be full of fligu gigus, I live for JB's impromptu scatting in the middle of huge epic ballads.&&Brutal Legend the movie?&&I rented the dvd version as a teenager, and was so disappointed to find that there were no special features. Especially disappointed considering School of Rock had tonnes, and POD had some videos released during filming before the film came out, as 'viral marketing'.&&I would buy another copy in a heartbeat on boy ray!&&I am complete!&&After you watch the movie, you should acquaint yourself with the TV show as well.&&""Lets take a ride on the strawberry river!""

If you like the D, you will love the movie.&&A long ass fuckin' time ago in a town called Kickapoo...&&I mean, if it's a movie about the D fighting monsters and aliens I'd watch the hell out of it. &&One is all you need.&&""Helmet head..get it on""&&Me too and I think he was fucking with us. &&I was at the show too and I definetly though he was fucking with us.&&Yeah the fact that he said it was coming out in October (which the article neglects to mention) made me think it was a joke.&&Don't you do this to me.

Looooook!&&I just hope for at least Brendon Small cameo &&Happy Cake Day!&&It was in Guitar Hero 3.&&Watched school of rock every day through middle school then graduated to Pick of Destiny through high school.

You fucking sit in your tower!&&What about 22 Jump Street, Christmas Vacation, Army of Darkness, Shrek 2? All sequels that were just as good, if not better than the original.&&If the songs are good, the movie should be good. And I'm confident in their songs.&&I mean Anchorman 2 is pretty funny&&Super troopers 2 was comedy gold!&&Anchorman 2 and Super Troopers 2 don't deserve to be compared to those other films.&&""Comparison is the thief of joy.""&&I can’t remember where I read it, and I make no claims to its veracity, but I read somewhere that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to star Jack Black. And it would’ve been what you’d expect from a Jack Black film, including a ring construct girlfriend &&What he does and how he acts has all the elements needed for him to be super obnoxious, but somehow he's so genuine it just *works*. I always feel like he's having a great time doing his thing.&&It's easy to think of some actors as second rate. But someone once said that Dolph Lundgren is so above average it's not even funny. He has a degree in chemical engineering, was European Champion in Kyokushin Karate and he's been in movies since -85.

The same could be said about Jack Black. People may think of him as a mediocre actor. But the fact is he's a famed actor, comedian and musician. Take away his acting gigs and he can still brag about his Grammy award and nominations.

Dolph and Jack are underdogs in the public opinion. And we all love an underdog story.&&""All those fuckin' youngsters gotta fuckin' lick our boot or fuck it.""&&He is one of the few celebs I would love to hang out with.&&He was great in Airborne!&&I loved him in The Last Man on Earth.&&you'll be able to see it at October?&&There are people who don't like School of Rock?&&Amazing drummer.

How could it be flawed if it was flawless tho

&&kickapoo is still one of my favourite songs lmao, Jack black is awesome all around &&You mean Dio and James Hetfield have unique brilliant voices. Cuz that's what Jack is.&&Tenacious D was the reason I learned to play guitar &&Yeah me too. Last year I googled the movie and was SHOCKED to see that it wasn't one of the highest rated movies of all time, and it was in fact very poorly reviewed. Still one of my favourite movies. Maybe the movie was just to advanced for most mortal minds.&&The movie itself may not have been great, but it gets a pass just for the opening song with Kickapoo. That whole thing was just fantastic and is even better than Beezleboss imo which is my second favorite song/scene in the movie.&&Did you watch the show before seeing the movie?

I was disappointed with the movie originally because I was hoping for a movie in the style of the show, but it was something very different. 

It eventually grew on me, but I feel like it's not as tight or funny as the show. &&It was a movie designed for tenacious d fans specifically.  

I really enjoyed it, but I can't pretend I'm surprised that it wasn't a huge hit.&&That river scene to this day is still so fucking hilarious  &&Or all 6 episodes are available for $5 on Vudu...

https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/title/805686?scrollPos=750&&I'd rather they pitch this as a sequel and then completely ignore the continuity on purpose. I think that would be hilarious. &&No, no--he said GOOD shit.&&I never get to tell that story, most people don’t know the guy by name. &&What was it like to rub the head of a rock legend?&&I wasn’t even mad&&Sounds like you’ve been doing some cock push-ups &&On one hand, I hope so. On the other hand, two new D albums would be very nice.&&His name was young J.B

And he refused to step in line&&Yeah, Brütal Legend.&&Jack Black and his identical game developer doppelganger.&&Yep, BrUtal Legend, it was a hack-and slash meet RTS, and playing it recently made me think of a single player and 1V1, story based MOBA.&&He didn't make it, he was a voice actor&&Can't you see he's the man, let me hear you applaud&&I fucking wish. The plot was waaay out there but fucking cool&&So I just had to make an account after years of lurking just to tell you this. 

I hope you're proud damnit.

The DVD did have special features. At least the one I have does. 

It included a ""character commentary"" feature, which was basically Jack and Kyle talking over the entire movie(mostly making up ""facts"" about the scene that was currently playing or jokingly trash talking people they worked with on set)

It's hilarious and by far one of the best special features I've ever found in my massive movie collection. &&It is sad. The closest we can got to a full 1080 release is on Netflix. &&Fuuuuuuuuuuck!&&The show was a work of art. 

CAGE! YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY!!! &&There is a TV show? &&The complete masterworks DVD is still relevant all these years later.&&Damn I had no clue it was such a big thing. I always thought it was this small thing Jack Black did before he got really popular with acting that happened to attract a decent amount of attention&&The movie is really just a smattering of all the tv episodes&&The original hbo skits are the bees knees it was on demand.  Always Record! Always Record! 

Rocket... Rocket! All of my Rocket sauce! &&It’s got some of their best songs too. Jesus Ranch, Kyle Took a Bullet, Special Things, all so good.&&Which is good because that’s all you can really do &&The article does mention it in the third* paragraph, but we'll see&&He was too old to rock

FUCKING FUCK YAAEHH

FUC-FUCKIN, *COCK-AYYESS*&&Fuckin nice&&Seems like the bad comedy sequels happen years after the original&&I think the sticking point should be they they're very long waited sequels. Those are tough to get right and it almost never works. It has to appeal to nostalgia a bit, update the humor a bit (otherwise it come off super juvenile to the original fans who are not kids anymore), make some jokes teens will get into, and get 100% out of the cast. It's not a small order at all. There's a reason long awaited sequels don't do so well by and large, especially in comedy. &&Is that the ghost of Stonewall Jackson!?&&I caught ST for the very first time about a month ago.

One of them was down and out, and was saved by the other. Which of the duo is Wonderboy, and which is Nastyman?

If I get to meet them the first thing I want to ask is ""What is your definition of the Mucky Muck?""

And tbh it didn't try and be anything else which I thought was the best thing about it.&&IIRC they both came out and said it was a disappointment. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it either. I think it depends very much on how old you were when you caught it. I do think they can do better and I hope they nail it with this one. The album is gold. &&The months of its initial release it was highly rated on IMDB.&&And for free if you have Amazon Prime.&&I can truly see jack black doing this. This isn't actually the sequel, this is just a tribute&&I usually tell folk that he’s the guy that tried to mug Ross in Friends, and then follow up with the fact he’s in a band with Jack Black. &&I wouldn't be either unless it was during spring break (my whole city has weed shortages during spring break which lasts like 2 months).&&I hope it's a ploy (is that the word I want here?) and the announced album is for the movie but they throw out a second one as well. The reason I want the announced one for the movie is cause they said it's a rock opera and a Tenacious D rock opera sounds like it would work super well as the soundtrack for their movie, but I still want to be greedy and ask for more music&&[deleted]&&Coincidentally I just put some songs from the Brütal Legend playlist in the queue.

I can't believe how badly such a beautiful game failed.&&I've wanted to pick it up. The cast looks absolutely insane.&&It was an RTS with driving and hack and slash elements sold as a pure hack-and-slash. The first few levels are heavy on the hack and slash and have no RTS, so the player (from the promo materials and their current experience) thinks this is a hack and slash. Suddenly, it morphs into an RTS. That U turn is hard to swallow, but I think as an RTS, it's not too bad either.&&He is more than a man, he's a shiny golden god!&&""There's Gold-Man. You hear about him before you see him.""&&I’M THA DEV-IL, I LOVE ME-TAL

CHECK THIS RIFF, *IT’S FUCKING TASTY*&&“Dude, this isn’t LSD. It’s EPT! I told you I didn’t want to pee on anything to get high.” &&[deleted]&&Loved the 'For Psycho Fans Only' art of the second disc.&&Do you mean the band or the movie? Because he was big waaaaaaayyyy before the Tenacious D movie. 

Bongwater, High Fidelity, Shallow Hal, School of Rock, Envy, King Kong, all years before the  Tenacious D movie. &&Fuck you kyle, you try to create something like inward singing!&&that song has become so melancholy and bittersweet&&Votes YES on proposition 208; legalise medical cocaine!&&I'm buh\-lind!&&It’s designed to make you feel like shit. Everyone puts their best stuff there, so all you see is this parade of awesome shit, like everyone is doing awesome things except you.

The truth of it is, the people who *really* have kickass lives, don’t spend their time bragging about it on Facebook. They’re too busy out there living.&&This is also why I mainly reddit now lol&&It’s why I deleted mine.  Still miserable, but at least I don’t have to look at other people pretend not to be lmao.&&This is why I don’t watch porn. &&Exactly why I deactivated my account. I found myself constantly comparing my life to my Facebook friends' ""highlight reels"". Between that, hostile, political arguments and Minions memes, I figured it was time to sign out and uninstall.

I've been so much happier, and not in a smug ""I don't own a TV""\-kind of way. Having been off it for a few months, it's bizarre seeing other people checking it all the time... for most folks, they check it as soon as they wake up and before they fall asleep. It's kinda messed up when you think about it.&&I read an article that described a negative correlation between the number of Facebook friends a person has vs their overall happiness and life satisfaction.  Since people tend to post only the best parts of their lives, viewers can get the false impression that other people are living better, more exciting lives than they are, resulting in lower satisfaction in their own lives.

I immediately went to my friends list and cut it by 2/3rds, and by God it worked.  Eventually left the platform altogether.&&This is why I deleted Facebook for the second time.&&I wonder if it would’ve turned out better. I don’t think he would’ve done well if they tried to shoehorn in grit like the other dc films. But at the same time, as much as I love him, I don’t he’d thrive if they tried to hard to emulate the MCU tone. &&Was Guy Gardner fat? I don't remember ever seeing him fat.&&The human rage monster Guy Gardner? The one that's so obviously obnoxious that Batman lost his cool with him and knocked him out? &&Guy is fat? I always thought he was short but stocky/built. In the cartoons he always looks like he has muscles.&&Fun fact, at Nirvana Unplugged in New York, Grohl was given brushes (not sure what they're actually called) instead of drumsticks because he just couldn't play quietly enough. &&""Hee hee!"" (grabs nuts)&&No it's just Baker Mayfield &&*Nohh*&&Unless we bust a massive monster mah-ma-jam
&&I remember first listening to that as a naiive young lad and thinking he was saying ""you're gonna gargle me an ace"" and never knew what it meant. Those were simpler times.&&^^^No&&We challenge you to a ROCK OFF!

Unfortunately my RB2 guitar crapped out about a year back and PS3 ones are super difficult to come by, so now I use the GH3 guitars, which don’t work too well on the RB games. &&Yeah I was there too, he said a sequal would be out in ""Rocktober.""&&YOU BROUGHT ME THE PICK AND NOW YOU SHALL BOTH DIE&&We challenge youu to a rockHOFF!

The game itself, though?  Yikes.  They went for this weird 3rd person RTS thing that really, really doesn't work, and the actually fun parts (the hack and slash bits) ended up very watered down as a result.

The gameplay is very uninspired, unfortunately.  The voice acting is also kind of hit or miss in places, unexpectedly.

It generally earned the pretty underwhelming reviews it got.  If you've got time to kill and you get it on sale, take it for a spin, but I would lower your expectations haha.  

It's also more unpleasant to play than it really should be because of how frustrating it is that they *didn't* make a masterpiece with the cast and concept.  There's so, so much wasted potential, and I at least couldn't get past thinking about that instead of focusing on the game.&&""Dude, it's the Time Goblin...""

He's authentic, who's going to say that the drummer of fucking *Nirvana* isn't authentic (!?), but at the same time he loves his family openly and takes steps to ensure his daughter has a positive future, he works hard and honestly because he believes it's his responsibility to put on nothing less than the greatest possible show, and he does it all without relying on drinks and drugs, because he knows that it isn't about how fucked up you get, it's about being true to yourself, working hard, and doing the right thing.

Gotta love KG’s cast photo on IMDB!&&#OH THE DRAGON'S BALLS WERE BLAZING&&*""But I likez 'im. He cuts the crust off my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. AND he looks like Danzig.""*&&Most of the gameplay was fun, but I couldn't stand the sudden RTS boss battles.&&Man, the game wasn't perfect but I think you're really underselling it. It is easily one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, the map is insanely awesome to explore, the story is awesome, and the gameplay (while simple) is almost Zelda-esque. The RTS was an odd choice but I actually found it quite addicting once I got over my initial unwillingness to learn it. 

I don't get how the RTS ""watered down"" the other elements of the game, either, because they simply added those battles as a gateway between levels. The RTS stuff didn't *take away* and potential hack-and-slash gameplay. In fact, the hack-and-slash was *integrated* into the RTS levels when it really didn't have to be, which I found awesome as someone who usually hates strategy games.

Sorry that was a long rant but I really feel like most people just quit this game after the first strategy battle with General Lionwhite and decided the game sucks before truly seeing how fun and creative it is.&&Jack, Kyle... It's Michael Keaton.  The time\-space continuum got FUCKED UP again.&&Maybe, but if you're the D, how do you not do a movie?&&Then who's selling the body wraps and diet pills?! &&I wouldn't hate my extended family as much or at all if not for their facebook. I finally looked away from that car crash and stopped using it.&&Very true. Reddit is far from perfect but I've never understood why so many redditors seem to think it's absolute trash now. Comparatively, it's still better than nearly any other social media site simply because intelligent conversation can actually be had without some dickwad interrupting it.

Just for example, two of the replie you just got are shitty but they aren't visible, where as they would be on Facebook.&&Unlike Facebook, anonymity is extremely high here.  Most people on Reddit lie about their lives anyway haha.

Love those things. &&Oh, thank you! :) &&DEACTIVATED LASERS WITH MY DICK&&You forgot the... ""dude...""&&The Demon Code prevents me from declining a rock\-off challenge!&&Jack Black as Himself&&I think the thing about Dave Grohl that's really apparent from watching his documentaries and any interviews with him, is that he's a huge fucking fanboy of all things rock and metal that just happened to become a legend in the industry and has never really let go of his influences. The Sonic Highways and Sound City documentaries basically involve him geeking out about all of his inspirations, even though he's worked with and been friends with lots of them for decades at this point. He was geeking the fuck out when the Foo Fighters brought Rick Astley out for a song when I saw them.

So he basically acts like a normal guy with a wife and kids, despite being fucking loaded and incredibly famous.&&If you ever decide to get rid of it, don’t take it to gamestop - sell it to someone that’ll actually use it.

Fighter of the Nightfury! aaaAAAaaah!&&Man, they keep discovering new islands and worlds 

Soon they'll find a Starbucks&&I’m not emotionally ready for whatever they’re prepared to unleash with this film.&&I really hope this doesn't turn into one of those ""there's a girl now"" story that every animated movie does &&So it will end with little gray toothlesses flying up into the sky.&&Yuuu-Gi-Oohhh!!! I call on blue eyes white dragon!&&How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2 are some of the best animated features to come out in a long time. I really hope this last one can wrap up the trilogy in a fulfilling way.&&oh shit toothless gonna smash&&I feel like the poster is massive spoilers, id rather have found out that there's another as a dramatic reveal in the movie rather then have it on a poster spoiling the moment. &&How to get your Dragon Laid&&Toothless and Tooth-lass&&I haven't read any of the books. Does a female white Nightfury appear in any of them?

Because right now this reminds me more of a DeviantArt fanfiction.&&If there's one thing the HTTYD franchise nails, it's the flying scenes. It's going to be amazing seeing breathtaking DreamWorks animation paired with John Powell's score&&The movie starts with toothless and hiccup palling around. 

They come across a mysterious land that has another of toothless' kind. 

Hiccup wants to leave. Toothless doesn't.

Hiccup gets angry and leaves him there. 

Hiccup ends up in trouble with the big bad.

Toothless comes to the rescue.

Hiccup accepts that toothless is better off on the mysterious land

Roll credits &&Plot twist: Toothless is gay&&Low key if this movie is awesome this is gonna be one of the best animated trilogies, scratch that, trilogies of all time.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold :)&&plot prediction:

- toothless is summoned away but like a natural instinct and leaves to follow the sonar thing without fligg.

- fligg, tj miller, and the other ones go to find him, and fligg only uses the fire sword to light a tunnel and it is never seen again in the film.

- other nightfuries live in a subterranean crystal dungeon, but don't like toothless, especially the girl one (who's high ranking in their flock).

- a bad nightfury (with a scar from fighting a giant dragon) competes with toothless, but toothless employs the help of fligg, and begins to prove that the humans are friends, while also catching the eye of the girl nightfury.

- the other vikings are fighting a second set of people who are trying to get to the crystals in the tunnel but they have to kill the nightfuries first. this is so they can give the mom character something to do.

- the bad nightfury gets in a huff, teams up with the bad people, and releases the giant dragon (probably a giant nightfury) but it goes badly and toothless and the other humans save the nightfuries. 

- fligg learns that animals are wild and need to live on their own.

- fligg sets toothless free to have sex with the white one for the rest of his life. last scene has baby nightfuries.&&Right, I might get some flack for voicing my opinion and get downvoted but whatever:           
Am I the only one that finds it frustrating that, these days, an animated movie would typically just simply introduce a new ""romantic interest"" character for the sake of a sequel? I'm sick of it, it happens too much and I wish sequels would just explore more of the original lore instead of adding cliche romantic-interest characters. It's either that, or the inevitable ""oh we have kids now"" sequel with existing romantic couples in the story.&&I really don't like this thing with animated movies where you discover the last of its kind character is actually not the last of its kind. It makes the characters much less unique in my opinion. Loved the first 2 movies though. Especially the first.&&I will fully support and watch any How to Train your Dragon movie simply because the first one is what brought off the horrible nightmare train i was on during a bad shroom trip. I went through shit with these characters.&&Twist: Hiccup had Toothless' gender wrong all along, the new dragon is a male, as clearly indicated by the brighter coat.&&The white dragon palette swap for the female love interest dragon is so basic and generic that it's lowered my hype for this movie. Still probably gonna see it, of course, don't worry about that, but this is DeviantART level fanfiction writing.&&Azor Ahai confirmed&&Cloak and dagger looks great &&Needs a Blacked watermark.&&Why does the female Nightfury HAVE to look so different than Toothless? I'm unreasonably frustrated by this.&&I watched the first movie 6 or 7 times when I got my wisdom teeth removed. I still get super choked up when his chest short gets blown away and they have to work together through the towering rocks and the music swells...I just teared up in a Bojangles. I hope this movie is good&&Lunastra DLC&&Guest starring Lugia.&&Extremely excited to hear what beauty John Powell and Jónsi conjure up for this. &&Get ready for rule34, this is gonna be a wild ride.&&Is this going to be like one of those Ice Age movies where they find another one of their own? &&This looks like a parody poster of Disney Fairies  Secret of the Wings&&I hope this doesn't go the predictable way I played out in my head when I saw this poster:

- Toothless and Hiccup discover another Night Fury
- Toothless starts spending time with her, falling in love with her
- She leads Toothless to a place full of Night Furies
- Hiccup has a tearful goodbye with Toothless, letting him go so he can be where he belongs&&Why was this gilded x5?&&Dayman fighting of the nightman&&Noooooo! This seems a bit generic! &&Fantastic movies with a fantastic soundtrack. The script to this movie supposedly made Steven Spielberg cry. I am so looking forward to this movie.&&I really, really loved the second movie and I hope they don't screw this one up, but they're already fucking op by introducing the ""not the last of his kind"" and the ""colour swapped love interest"".

Two of the worst tropes in animated movies.&&I hate that design. is it supposed to be a nightwing? is it albino? why would the female be white. that's absolutely horrible if she's supposed to protect the eggs. why do the reptiles have sexual dimorphism to this extreme. could they really not think of any other goddamn plot. fuck.&&Movie pitch: But what if there’s a girl version AND she’s white?!&&What if the white dragon is also a dude and this movie is being real progressive. Y'all here assuming his gender and shit smh.&&OH THEY FAWKIN&&I heard rumours of the ‘Light Fury’ being a character in the third movie and desperately hoped they weren’t true. I’m so disappointed and let down that the story won’t be much more than a thirteen year old girls’ self-insert fan fiction. After the first two movies I honestly expect better.&&Why are the females always light colors &&This poster is *really* ugly. Who made it?&&We know it’s female because it’s white&&Oh, you're a *lady* dragon.&&How to Breed Your Dragon&&And of course the girl dragon is just a plain and basic watered down version of Toothless. What is this? Deviantart?&&How to Train Your Dragon 3: bros before hoes&&Oh my god. My heart.&&♪ Ebony and ivory... ♪&&Is nobody gonna mention how bad this poster is? It looks like the cover for a GameCube game &&Dey gon fuk&&Plot twist the white dragon is male  &&Sponsored by Bad Dragon&&I can’t help but think these movies are just a way to keep Jay Baruchel supplied with weed. &&Why does the poster look like some bad fan art?&&He is not trained in how to make baby dragons. ;) &&Not trained to breed!!!&&Yes, but gotta keep that brand recognition. &&How to Breed Your Dragon&&I think there'll be a semi-goodbye because of the love interest. Ending like the end of Pirates Of The Carribean where whatshisface come back ever few years after he's the new Davy Jones.  
  
Toothless will visit Hiccup every year/few years, and scenes from those visits will be playing with the credits.&&Plot:

T&H see wild white dragon, get excited (both) 

Oh shit she's actually a bad girl and toothless is not mature enough for her or something (also maybe evil)

H: Don't hang around the bad kids bro

T: fakka u DAD stop smothering me *hairflip*

Best friend break up scene 💯 sad, maybe montage of sad Hiccup with unsure toothless. 

Toothless realizes he ain't with it. Goes to Hiccup who has ""moved on""

T: ?????

H: fakka u 

T: 💯 sad 

Astrid (edited to the right girl) who will lacks significant screen time this movie: ay don't be dumb he's your bro 

T&H: Huff puff ""boys"" make up mode. 

Villain literally doesn't matter since the main point is Toothless getting the girl anyway. 

Hufflepuff sends his Ravenclaw to be with Gryffindor, movie ends with Hiccup and Toothless kids playing together in some bittersweet way. 

E: Forgot to mention the two 10 minute flight scenes, one which will be the opening with Hiccup trying out some new gadget (and it probably failing), and the other which will show Moonfury being able to fly just as fancy as the bro team which is what will make our night boy fall for her in the first place. &&How to Train Your Dragon 3: Training Gets Weird&&Please be better than this. But yes this was my first thought. ""Suddenly a female counterpart exists, and now we're doing this same old story again.""&&nah I think its gonna be a race war&&How To Train Your Dragon 3: Bros Before Hoes&&""TOOTHLESS WE HAVE TO GO SAVE THE WORLD""

""BUT DRAGON PUSSY!""&&See, Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4. &&They have been doing a TV series in the middle&&They were also busy with the animated series on Netflix which I recommend watching as it ties one and two together fairly nicely.&&holy shit by the time this film comes out next year it would have been almost 10 years since the first film what the fuck.&&no way it's been 5 years wtf&&5 years? Time flies &&Oh shit really?! What day??&&After they gave away the whole fucking plot and twist in the HTTYD2 trailer I'm fine not watching the trailer for this. &&“Good, twice the dragons, double the fun”&&“Hello there!”&&Prequel memes coming in on HTTYD. I don’t like it, I don’t agree to it...but I accept it. &&oh, I don't think so.&&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one! &&Still only one night fury.  She is a blue eyes white dragon. &&Champion of Berk! aaaaAAAAaaah! He's the master of flying and friendship for everyone!&&My money's on it being called a Moon Fury.&&Lightfury!&&/r/Unexpectedgoldengod &&Wearing dragonmittens !&&It's the Blue-Eyes White Dragon! Unstoppable Exodia confirmed for HTTYD 3.&&Then Toothless will get arrested by police while waiting for a friend. &&Well, they open their world to outsider, so it's Starbuck and maybe the Olympics. &&I mean, they're 15th century Vikings (or a fantasy analog of). Finding new islands and discovering worlds was like Tuesday.&&If it follows the ending of the final book, then don't worry, it'll be crushing.&&Same. I expect a standard, but still heartbreaking plot, as HTTYD do.

Though I’m really looking forward to seeing how the art style has evolved. One of the main things I love about these movies is the absolutely top notch gorgeous animation.&&Someone please explain how the previous two movies make my heart implode when I watch them. &&I'm guessing Tootless is gonna leave him to start a family with the white dragon&&Were you ready for the last two? I sure as heck wasn’t. My only regret in life is missing the live performance. &&It’s probably dragon sex. Clicking on random links to Deviantart has prepared me a little too well.&&*[Narrator]*

It was.&&You know it will my dude. It's Ash with Butterfree all over again. &&This was so obviously coming down the pipe. They especially set it up in the 2nd film when his mom said Toothless is probably the only dragon of his kind. Obviously there were going to be others, specifically a girl one that Hiccup has to leave him with in order to let him have a happy life&&But... a girl!!! A girl is the ultimate plotwist! A GIRL! In ADVENTURES? Who will test their FRIENDSHIP? And be a... romantic interest? Like a girl does? That's the greatest 👌 

I loved sooo much the first one, still crying when I watch it again and again, I prefer to start disappointed. That way it can't be a heartbreak &&Another Nightfury was the only way it was ever going to go, but you're right. It's straight out of Ice Age! &&[deleted]&& Nah I think it will end up with Hiccup leaving Toothless to be with own kind, then Hiccup being in danger for some reason, Toothless and others of his species saving him and then a real goodbye happens.  
  
Edit; further prediction, maybe at the end we'll get one of those ""It'not good bye, it's cya later buddy"" endings and Toothless' species will migrate every so often (perhaps the stopped for some reason, lending to the apparent rarity of Night Fury dragons) and we'll get to see Toothless and Hiccup grow old through credit overlay scenes when Toothless visits Hiccup on his migrations with his new family.  
  
I don't think they'd do us dirty like that Lilo And Stitch fan art comic... you know the one.&&You just activated my trap card : ""*Copyrights*""!&&Wait did you just summon a bunch of monsters all at once?&&Well, the script made Steven Spielberg cry. That’s promising! “complete unqualified classic and better than the original.”&&Kung Fu Panda 1, 2 and 3 were all solid.  DreamWorks has pulled it off before, so let's hope!&&THERES ANOTHER NIGHT FURY&&I really love this series and so do my kids.  I'm hopeful we get a good resolution.&&Owo&&How to Breed Your Dragon&&For this series I'd stay away from all promotions if you can. The trailer for the second one spoiled who the mysterious dragonrider was, and the soundtrack track titles spoiled the death.&&I'm more or less sure that this poster is all the rule 34's artists need&&Aside from a handful of character names, the only thing the movies have in common with the books is the name. I haven't read them either, nor do I ever intend to, but I don't think Toothless is even a Nightfury in them. &&There are no Night Furys in the book series IIRC. Toothless is catagorised as a Toothless Daydream (Or a baby Seadragonus Giganticus Maximus...Spoilers maybe).&&The past two films have taken extremely overused tropes; a boy and his dog and son vs. father, and made them wonderfully unique in every way. With the same team attached, I expect no different from this one.&&....there's  books? o.O&&I have to agree.  This poster and its color scheme looks too much like the cover of a run-of-the-mill kids animated series on Netflix.

I am willing to give Dreamworks the benefit of the doubt here, given how great the first two films are.

It's not so much the sake of a sequel, as a third as always been on the agenda. A trilogy was announced before the second even hit theatres.&&Yeah... I remember Rio 2 which shitted so hard on the first one about this ""last of its kind"" thing.&&Happens in Ice Age, happens in Kung fu Panda, probably a bunch of other stuff im forgetting, and it is pretty much always a tired and lame plot point.&&Where did they ever say Toothless was the last of his kind?&&I agree, and even worse is when they keep adding opposite sex counterparts to the main characters with each new movie, that's why i'm a bit sceptical here but we'll see.

Can there be a decent story without love?&&I'm having flashbacks of that Lilo and Stitch sequel where they made a [pink, curvy version](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/5/5e/Angel_transparent.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220062630) of Stitch to be his girlfriend&&Holy shit, I thought I was the only one, I love the first 2 movies but looking at this poster got me feeling a bad way&&My first thought when seeing the poster image was a flashback to Ice Age 2, and the horrendous mammoth love interest plot in it.&&Maybe it’s albino and therefore sort of on its own?&&""can you feel the love tonight""played in my mind when I saw the poster&&For the night is dark and full of terrors.&&The Prince who was promised!

It's also very possible that she's leucistic (white)....which happens a lot to axolotls due to genes.

They cross lines and barriers hardly ever seen in animated films, and use the trick where that jolly and cute exterior leads the way into some truly dark moments.

Remember in HTTYD1 when [Stoic went through a good chunk of the film as if he regretted his son's entire being? And when towards the end, as he was getting his hopes up, something happened that finally gave him reason to legit DISOWN him? And then later, Stoic redeems himself by not only saving Toothless but saying a line that is literally bringing me to tears typing it out right now: ""I'm proud to call you my son."" The best part about it is that Stoic was always well-meaning, but simply had inhibiting character flaws.](#spoiler)

In HTTYD2, [remember when Valka was afraid to reunite Stoic because Stoic in the first film, as she knew him, would've reacted terribly? Remember when he completely countered her expectations and was beyond everything she could've ever hoped for, which perfectly represented his character development from the first film?](#spoiler)

In HTTYD2, [remember when the film crossed the line of, ""key hero characters can't die in animated films!"" And in the most brutal way possible--no final words, no heroic music, and by the breath of his own friend. No macguffin to bring him back to life. The funeral scene afterwards was one of the most powerful I've ever seen in a film.](#spoiler)

The music helps a lot too. John Powell masterfully told stories for scenes with very little major dialogue, just by the music weaving into it. Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship, Where No One Goes, Stoic's Ship...so damn good.&&[deleted]&&>HTTYD2 was kind of meh.

HTTYD2 was a good follow up to the original, but I think I would have liked to rather see their original plan with Hiccup's mother as the antagonist. Drago felt underdeveloped, like the idea of a foil to Hiccup, but someone's who's ""bad because bad"" isn't as compelling to watch. Whereas his mom would have been working to ""free"" the dragons ""enslaved"" by Berk.&&toy story hello?&&that and toy story are probably the kings right now&&Toy Story won't be a trilogy for long as TS4 is coming out.&&Also Ice Age 2&&To be fair, Rio is based on a real life Spix Macaw named Presley (https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140629-spix-macaw-presley-rio-parrot-brazil-science/) and they do have some Spix macaws in sanctuaries to try and repopulate the species.  Jewel was a wild caught one, so one could argue there was a chance that there were others out there, but Blu was a confirmed male so it would make breeding them easier than looking for another needle in a haystack.&&Never explicitly, super implied by always talking about how no one has ever seen another one and stuff like that, but in the second movie the main characters mother seems to already know a good deal of stuff about toothless, like how to make his turning scales protrude more and how to tell his age from spots under his neck, that implies quick heavily he isn’t the last one&&It's mentioned a few times, but always 'probably' or 'might'. Hiccup's mom says it and the old blacksmith guy says it at some point.&&In the second movie Hiccup mentions that they might find another Night Fury on one of the uncharted islands.

10/10. Would probably cry in the theatre&&Just like shrek 2&&[removed]&&got to see early preview doing online marketing surveys ( they were picking the name ) and i am glad to tell you it is not the case 

white night fury is not evil ( but can turn invisible and blows purple smoke ... so that is cool )

bad guy pretty much same as number 2 ... wants to control/destroy all dragons ( but much better at it ) so hiccup who is now all grown up facial hair and all decides he needs to find a place all dragons can be safe forever i.e the hidden valley 

movie looking like it is going to end with humans and dragons being apart forever

Toothless’s biggest weakness (injured tail) is what allowed them to bond in the first place and a huge part of the movie was overcoming that hurdle. Then in the end of the film it was perfectly matched when both of their “disabilities” (and what originally connected them) then literally connected them as if they were actually made for each other. Such a powerful moment to me. &&Looking forward to a short comedic little montage of that to be honest. It'll overset the more serious plot kinda nicely.

>Drago felt underdeveloped, like the idea of a foil to Hiccup, but someone's who's ""bad because bad"" isn't as compelling to watch. Whereas his mom would have been working to ""free"" the dragons ""enslaved"" by Berk.

While Drago was underdeveloped, he was exactly what he needed to be. Hiccup goes into the film with this idealist mindset that any enemy can be talked down and reasoned with. He needed Drago to counter that as someone who simply cannot be reasoned with, someone to remind Hiccup that while idealism is a good start, it can't be the be-all-end-all.&&Also a big part of the movies is how little they actually know about the dragons and the world&&Coincidental* not ironic at all&&Not irony&&*dreamworks&&Ah~ My homeland.&&Acting like they ain't gonna put hyper herm dicks all over those dragons.

The only way I see them becoming independent from each other is if they come across some sort of healing dragon that regens his tail.&&That doesn't leave much room for more series though, and I don't see them stopping this money train.

EDIT: The more I read in this thread, the more it sounds like they always meant for it to be a trilogy, so you are probs right, but I am sad.&&I have doubts but at the same time, there have been leaks for other stuff that people have dismissed that turned out to be true so I got my eye on you.

In the books the dragons are pretrained and hiccup in the books is like hiccup the 27th or whatever and he finds a book by a previous hiccup who originally trained the dragons and looked just like hiccup the 27th or whatever

Its a bit loose and its been many years since I read the series, but it fits pretty nicely tbh

Edit: canon I blame auto corect&&I find the david tennant audio book versions to be awesome on their own though. As long as you realize that the only commonality between the books and the films are the whole ""Hiccup uses his wits and his understanding of Toothless to come out on top"" theme line and are okay with EVERYTHING ELSE BEING DIFFERENT, they're good.&&Even the names are only sort of similar. There are a handful of main characters who share the same names, but are often wildly different in terms of personality. Like instead of Astrid, there's a character named Camicaze who's exactly like her namesake and often needs Hiccup to be the reasonable one. &&The books are much better, I mean... Toothless the dragon is green without teeth and pathetic. The film one is black, has teeth(??) and big! &&For anyone wondering, [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/howtotrainyourdragon/images/a/a0/Tumblr_static_hiccup-and-toothless.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20151026090213) is what Hiccup and Toothless look like in the book version. The film versions are somewhat more badass.&&And I think he actually _is_ toothless, hence the name.&&I'm going to take a wild guess that the kids are not dragon riders in the book&&Seriously. I don't know anyone else who read them either.&&>no big boobied bertha in the movies

miss me with that gay shit&&Why would you be insulted? It's not a copy of the book, but it's still a good fun kids movie.&&Very, *very* loosly though.&&If it's done well, then it can work sometimes.  However, I feel like the majority of those plots/subplots end up being:  guy wants girl; guy is unmitigated moron, literally made to look like an idiot at every turn; girl is made to be either completely flawless or never wrong about anything \(helps when girl is in white attire, symbolizing perfection and/or purity\); queue extremely contrived event; guy and girl are suddenly deeply committed after knowing each other for only the 10 minutes it took to complete the contrived event.

Sometimes a movie can break away from that, like with Wall\-E.  The antics the movie puts him through at the beginning are less idiotic and much more silly in an endearing way\-\-and they continue to build his character throughout the rest of the film.  But I still honestly more enjoy plots where male and female leads are hinted at having some chemistry that never gets in the way of the actual plot.  And they are also placed on equal footing.  For example Castle In The Sky.  Maybe this film will be different, and I hope it is\-\-I liked the first two.  The movie poster makes me uneasy though.&&How dare you show me this.&&Oof&&What a digital dummy...&&For real though, who trades a butterfree for a raticate?? That always bothered me&&From random internet hearsay, I'm told that in the Japanese version, butterfree mate and then die, so there's that.&&I'm hoping for this one. &&That's ok, they got to spend like four or five seasons doing random shit in the TV show.&&Okay, but like then toothless will make the voice to come back with the nice white Nightfury lady dragon right?

Right?

Your comment made me cry. &&I think they'll try end it on a more hopeful note. Probably finds a way to fix Toothless with some magic in the Hidden World or something, then free him with other/all dragons? Idunno, we shall see&&In the ending of one of the shorts Hiccup builds a tail wing that allows Toothless to fly independently, but Toothless rejects it.&&That cat going Ohhhhhhh, in puss in boots still gets me everytime.&&There isn't a Shrek 5 yet you goons, lmfao.&&Seconded.  PiB was a solid entry.&&What is Shrek 5?&&Yes but I feel it was a criminal waste of JK Simmons voice acting for Kai.

I'd say if (theroizing etc) theres a love interest and it all goes similar to what I said with your comment taken into account (which is very relevant, I forgot all about the cant-fly-unaided' thing) theres still a big ol' chance that Toothless and Hiccup will be seperated. Honestly it'd be fine with me IF it's the last film of the franchise. A proper goodbye/ending.&&That would be awesome! Admittedly I didn't watch the show, only the fisrt episode, which I felt like didnt really have the charm of the movies y'know?&&I thought that HTTYD 3 [almost didn't get made at all](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1596860/how-to-train-your-dragon-3-has-been-delayed-heres-when-its-hitting-theaters) due to Dreamwork's funding issues, though? 

I do know that Dreamworks has been suffering financially quite a bit over the past several years. They also had to cancel a movie they already had in development for some years called *Me & My Shadow* [(Source)](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/watch-never-seen-animation-dreamworks-aborted-shadow-146732.html), allegedly in favor of making *Home*, *Trolls*, and *Penguins of Madagascar*.

I'm glad that Dreamworks decided to make HTTYD 3 after all, but given the company's track record, I'm not so sure about them continuing the HTTYD series, after HTTYD 3, in film format. Despite making quite a bit of money, [HTTYD 2 also underperformed at the box office](http://ew.com/article/2014/08/29/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-box-office/) by Dreamworks's standards.&&That's good to hear coming from them. Even to this day, I still can't watch the ending for Toy Story 3 without crying. It is just so damn emotional and was one of the most well done endings to a trilogy that I have seen.&&Plus I don't think this is Disney trying to push them to make movies for money, because it's been pretty easy for Pixar to show that they can make 300m off of any new IP.&&I think we're going to have to be careful about the rape scene.&&*Zis....iz Bërk...*&&Sounds like a Wolfenstein story.  BJ and Hitler get tossed back in time to Camelot where BJ turns out to be King Arthur and Hitler can shape shift into a dragon.

I would actually play the crap out of this.&&LMAO&&It was a 90s fantasy film where Sean Connery voices a dragon who shares it heart with a dying king(David Thewlis), story progresses after that. Dennis Quaid plays a knight who stars in it along with the dragon. 

There were other movies but I only saw the first sequel which was a prequel. &&I feel like you should see a doctor if your hiccups last more than 25 generations.&&IIRC The Hiccup in the books is Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third. I believe that it's discovered that Hiccup 1 discovered Berk and Hiccup 2 started the practice of Dragon Training so my headcanon is that the films are about Hiccup 2.&&[removed]&&How to train your pet dragon&&Only after the fifth, but they have different dragons to ride on.&&I read them and quite liked them, but felt they wouldn't make great movies so was pretty happy they changed so much&&I read them as a kid and tbh the movie is a lot more badass.

I was reluctant to even see the movie, and was so happy with what the movie did. I agree that it shouldn't be considered an adaptation, but I must say I enjoyed the movies much more than the books.&&with literally the best page detailing from the book's dragon training manual:

There were a lot of parallels to dog training in the first book.&&While that would personally amuse me, I still feel like the better film would put them on equal footing.

It’s just a weird twist how this book was adapted into such a visually stunning film.

Whoever wrote that deserves some credit, because Achmed was not the first feature length animation \- that distinction belong to a film, and filmmaker, that almost no one has heard of. The film was El Apóstol, and it's creator was Argentinian animator Quirino Cristiani:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El\_Ap&#37;C3&#37;B3stol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ap%C3%B3stol)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirino\_Cristiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirino_Cristiani)

The reason no one has heard of this film or it's creator? Two fires broke out in the warehouse where the only known copies of his work were stored, in 1957 and 1961. Between them, they destroyed his life's work.

Im pretty sure he was the guy who invented those little dot things on the sides of film but dont quote me on that. I know he invented something towards the Lumiere style of movies but im not sure what.

Also she and her team invented the multi-plane camera setup for this movie, something which Disney are usually given credit for (I think for Pinocchio specifically). Though Reiniger's was completely vertical and was different on one other important count, I think something to do with the background plane.&&I just listened to this episode today! &&Who is “she”?&&That's where I learned of her as well !

I'd say they both still look incredible, for different reasons obviously.&&Well, this is merely the oldest surviving *feature* film, being 65 minutes. There were several earlier examples of animation, while not being so long.&&Not to say that Snow White wasn’t an incredible work, because it certainly was.

MY JAWS THAT BITE
MY CLAWS THAT CATCH&&[This is from almost 100 years ago](http://www.thisisinsider.com/comic-strip-expectation-versus-reality-meme-2018-4).&&Silent films, better known today as *gifs*&&Movies have been quite high quality the entire 20th century. The yellow, scratched up ultra-low resolution good old times movie is nothing but a trope.

Check out [this still from a 1927 movie](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/83/35/348335c192636ee93dc3d0b0b47e5a5c.jpg), for example.&&Film has basically always been pretty high res. The reason people associate old movies with being low def is because the early home video versions of them were usually of pretty poor quality. The same goes for many much more modern films as well. [Here's a good comparison of the 2016 restoration of the 1991 film *A Brighter Summer Day* with previous available versions of it.](https://youtu.be/2AMSHs2adWk) It really shows how much better home video  and digital technology has become.
So as long as there's a decently preserved print of an old movie it should look pretty good.  
[Here's a clip from the recently restored version of one of my favorite movies *The Passion of Joan if Arc* from 1928 for example.](https://vimeo.com/241549359)&&Nitrate film is analog. It can be transferred to digital at high resolutions.&&Standard film is around 20,000 pixels per square mm. This is an estimation, of course, as film doesn't use ""pixels"".&&Everyone wanna give the guy a medal for pulling the sword up - how about something for the dude who put it there. 

One party system my fucking arse, Arthur! &&I wouldn't be surprised if this was an influence on the film.&&Yeah, I’m being serious as well. It’s beautiful.&&[Relevant animated scene with a similar B&W style](https://streamable.com/9rv9d), from [Puella Magi Madoka Magica \(2011\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1773185/)&&As an adult who basically only watches cartoons, I loved it. &&The storybook sequence in Harry Potter Deathly Hallows Pt 1 is modeled off the style of this film. &&Yeah that long thin figure looks a lot like the monster form of the Moon King in Kubo And The Two Strings which is also stop motion. I wonder if Kubo’s creators saw this. &&I don't know about that, but it's an interesting style. Reminds me of shadow puppets. &&For a modern version, see the French film [""Princes et princesses""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-tWKLABb5I).&&Isn't this sort of the like the Tale of the three Brothers scene in the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (or 2?)?&&Smooth out the movements and you'd definitely create a really memorable scene &&I got to see this at the Music Box in Chicago with live organ accompaniment and it really was beautiful.

Also worth noting for those not keyed into the name, the director is a woman.&&I showed it at my independent cinema here in Ireland with live music. People loved it it was so fluent.

I used to be involved in a group that did live improvised jazz soundtracks to old silent movies; Nosferatu and the like. We did not charge for shows but the estate of Lotte Reiniger contacted us after a performance of Prince Achmed and demanded a sum of money otherwise they would take us to court. We never had issues with any other movie.&&Reiniger [had originally wanted to include a homosexual scene in Prince Achmed](https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=_4kwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT137&lpg=PT137&dq=lotte+reiniger+originally+filmed+homosexual+scene&source=bl&ots=LIB7-cEaGd&sig=9DOHrT-T2Th6I4SW-xF8jSy2VII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq5e2Tua_bAhVFurwKHQ7wCrUQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&q=lotte%20reiniger%20originally%20filmed%20homosexual%20scene&f=false) to show children that homosexuality was natural - imagine her reaction to any episode of South Park other than the one where Butters is bi. (In 1922! This could only be more surprising if either she'd been allowed to keep it in, or if she wasn't working in Weimar Germany.)&&Lotte Reiniger, who created this, was active in Germany at a time when nazi artists and other social influencers were crawling out of the woodworks.

[This czech movie from 1959 is also AMAZING for it's handmade effects. The lines and all that in the background are done by hand to give the whole movie a litograph-kind of feel, like pictures in old books.

Edit: The District Attorney dropped the ball. Not NYPD.

*He previously evaded arrest in 2014 when he was investigated by the NYPD for groping then-22-year-old Italian model Ambra Battilana. Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance decided not to pursue charges at that time, a move that has been widely criticized in the aftermath of the cascade of accusations leveled at Weinstein in late 2017. The move also angered factions of the NYPD, which had wired Battilana at the time and made a recording of an encounter between her and Weinstein in which he is heard admitting to assaulting her. That case may have proved to be the crack in armor of Weinstein, who had buffered himself with a series of legal settlements followed by non-disclosure agreements. The audio eventually made its way to then-NBC correspondent Farrow, whose reporting never saw the light at the network but was eventually used for his work in The New Yorker.*&&Don't rape.

&&Ambra Battilana deserves a lot of credit. She went to police knowing that, in these cases, odds of conviction are slim. Over the last year we've been constantly hearing stories about victims going years back who didn't go to police because they thought it would be pointless. But Battilana's complaint is what set the whole Weinstein/Metoo thing in motion, even if it didn't get a conviction in her specific case. The lesson is that there's a purpose to reporting crime, even if you don't think that your complaint will result in a conviction. People should think of it as a civic duty, not just something that's about them personally. &&Cy Vance just tweeted this: https://twitter.com/ManhattanDA/status/1000011158995259394

Yeah, because I'm sure if you had a successful career in Hollywood you would gladly go on a vendetta against one of the most powerful people in the industry only to have it all swept under the rug and your career/reputation completely destroyed. Not everyone can be as altruistic as you.&&I mean, I do think people should say something, but making it illegal not to is obviously a bad idea.

Plus, people like Harvey would likely ruin your career and life just for thinking about turning him in&&His enablers are basically all of Hollywood and the media who let this go on for years. They all knew.&&Fuck Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence?&&Maybe not the best idea, that might encourage people to keep complete silence if they see something and don't immediately come out for fear of prosecution. &&Brian Singer pending too&&Are there any actual allegations against him or is it just the memes?&&Dan (Insert wacky quote here) Schneider&&[deleted]&&Morgan Freeman&&Dan Schneider has not a single allegation against him.

The dude had done Jack shit and has not had a single allegation against him.&&Great, now I'll be singing ""Nickelodeon Girls"" for the next 3 days again.&&The only reason he’s even being pursued like this is because his accusers are rich. Not a whole lot of victims can bring something to trial years after the case. 

We have a long way to go. &&Investigations take time. Shit, my XBOX got stolen and the entire proceedings took a year.

Try being happy when you starve to death.&&The trouble arguing money=happiness though is that the wealthy DO experience just as much stress as any other person, though the nature of the stressor may be vastly different, the way it's quantified is just the same. Of course being wealthy affords a greater financial resource pool but then there's perhaps the feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness that comes with repeatedly throwing money at problems and not having them resolved (relationships, self worth, etc).

I believe that it's the presence of these stressors which often infringes on quantifiable happiness, and in reality it's solving one problem but allows much more focus as well as greater expectations on all the rest.

Should we then assume his innocence, as law dictates? Should we go with whatever the media told us? (Never forget: everything we know, we know from media.)

Yes, I believe that Tarantino told the truth when he said that he knew stuff about Weinstein.

But if a court of law finds him not-sufficiently-proven-guilty... what then? Still silently assume his guilt? Postpone judgment? Do as the law does?&&He didn't see it coming.&&Eh, now that there are actual criminal charges he's probably keeping his mouth shut. No point in giving the prosecutor more to work with. &&Rather everyone knew, but if you went against people like Weinstein and the other big shots that haven't been named yet, well, that old cliche ""You'll never work in this town again"". These are the type of men that actually can and will destroy your career and make the public literally think you're a loon. Look at Dave Chapel or Michael Jackson (Cory Feldman, who was abused as a kid in Hollywood, said that Neverland Ranch was the safest place for kids in Hollywood. I honestly think Michael was framed to disparage him because he stepped on those powerful people's toes. After all, if you get every one saying Michael is the pervert no one will be looking at the actual abusers and given how much of an eccentric person Michael was, was easy to get the public to go with it and destroy his reputation.) both of them were critical of the system, then the system turned on them to shut them up. I do think there is some hypocrisy at play, but a larger part is fear. A lot of celebrities saw it as a hill they'd die on and the only outcome of speaking out would be career suicide. Weinstein is a start, but there are more people in that system, ruling it by fear of their staggering industry pull.&&No, I will not fuck that guy. &&I resent when people use this argument because it implies that rape is about *sex* rather than *power*. Sex workers are not a solution to deal with that. Rapists and men like Harvey get off on the power trip/force/abuse/humiliation.&&BBC Lunchtime News just said he's been charged with rape and assault, with $1million bail.&&Depends on how good your manners are … how big your pocketbook is.&&So in New York we're probably talking about third degree rape (basically sex without consent but no physical force or threat of force is used).  That's a class E felony:  4 years jail time and up to 5000 dollars in fines (though I'd expect more in civil court if convicted).  If, somehow, they can make the case that it should be a First Degree rape case (not super likely) he'd be looking at 2-25 years.  

The criminal sex act is most likely forcible touching (though oddly if the forced sex was anal it's a much worse crime).  he's probably looking at another year for that. 

So if guilty on all charges here, we're talking up to 12 years in prison and maybe 10,000 in fines. If the prosecution gets to have a field day it could be worse. 

EDIT:  if my IT department is reading this, I swear I googled ""New York Rape Paws"" for totally innocent reasons.

EDIT:  Rape Paws is my best typo all week.  &&3 months in jail and an early release for good behavior&&Criminal Sex act is usually used to describe a non-aggravated or “violent” crime. 

In New York State where I’m from it’s described by:

Engage in anal sex or oral sex with another person by forcible compulsion, engage in anal sex or oral sex with another person who is physically helpless,
Engage in anal sex or oral sex with another person who is less than 11 years old, or you are at least 18 years old and you have anal sex or oral sex with someone who is less than 13 years old.  - Punishments range from fines to 25 years in Prison.  These can be misdemeanor offenses.

Now “aggravated sexual assault” on the other hand has to do with amount of violence and bodily harm used in the crime.  These are violent felony charges, punishments can range from fine to 5- life since these are exclusive labels used for Class B and A violent felony charges.

What does this all mean?

Criminal Sex Act?  He’ll get off with a Class B or C non-violent felony plea-deal and pay some money.  Bullshit right?  Since charges are based on level of physical bodily harm in these types of laws, the amount of money and notoriety of the victims have will play heavily into sentencing probably. 
——
Edit:  After thinking about it for a minute.  If I were a prosecutor I would probably pursue charges from a “Domestic Violence” angle because:

“A pattern of coercive tactics, which can include physical, psychological, sexual, economic and emotional abuse, perpetrated by one person against an adult intimate partner, with the goal of establishing and maintaining power and control over the victim.”

By calling the victims “partners” I could create a lot more wiggle room with burden of proof.   Misdemeanor Domestic Violence in my State carries higher minimum punishments than sex crimes, so I would try to tack something on that sells better to a Jury anyways.

Edit 2:  does anybody else think our whole way of prosecuting crimes is a bit odd?

Think about it - a prosecutor acts in behalf of the State itself there’s no private victim appointed lawyers in criminal courts. Our penal code has nothing to do with victims.  Prosecutors research historical rulings to create precedence for indictment.  

This is kind of like when you go to your parents when you’re a kid and say “hey tommy punched me” and the response you get is “well you always just punched him back before!”.&&In all seriousness, Ronan Farrow (Mia Farrow and Woody Allen's son) is the person who wrote the exposé about Weinstein. Farrow has had a [full life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan Farrow), even though he's only 30. &&Why? (Out the loop!)&&And demanding a thorough explanation of why he wasn't charged&&I would have so much fun being an NYPD wired woman helping to build a case against these guys&&They deserve MORE credit, don't they? Since their story actually broke and caused all this and Farrow's was just in the pipeline?&&Actually the NYT broke it only three or four days before the New Yorker. They were both working on it for over a year at the same time, so Farrow was going ahead with it anyways. &&I know it’s right there at the top of the wiki, but it is also notable that he is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist now. &&he ain't Woody's&&I can't believe they named him Satchel&&There's no way he's not Sinatra's kid.&&He started working for the government/state dept at age 20.&&Becerra has only been Atty General since 2017, there's no way he's suspect.

He was rich and influential. He could've had as many hot, young women as he wanted, but he couldn't have any woman he wanted. So it morphed into this horrible thing where him knowing it was sexual assault and rape was what drew him to do it in the first place. I think he was into it because it was illegal and morally wrong. &&You shouldn't abstain from pork just cause you think that I want you to

And I'm glad they are.  This was a great way to shock the public into action.  Now fewer of those filthy rich assholes are getting away with shit because of all the victims of Weinstein and his ilk spoke out.  Their stories have normalized something positive.  

That's maybe a thing we can bear in mind next time some dipshit on the internet says ""why can't they just stick to acting"".  Because celebrity can be used to help people.  The fact that everyone listens to them can, in fact, be a good thing.  People on Reddit like to demonize celebrity worship, but if nobody gave a crap about Alyssa Milano or Rose McGowan of Ashley Judd then this guy would still be raping young actresses.  &&This is all happening (deservedly) to him because there’s so many people in Hollywood who are doing the same thing he did and want people to focus their outrage at one person rather than the industry who allowed it to happen for decades.&&There's plenty of rapists in Hollywood's that A List actors are scared to name &&I read this in the Morrowind ""Why walk when you can ride?"" voice.&&Just goes to show how rape goes beyond a sexual thing into like a fucked up power thing. When you're as rich as Weinstein you could pay the most high-class former olympic gymnast sort of escorts to go bananas all over you. Not even just escorts, I mean old rich dudes have famously never had a problem attracting suitors.

It's all about control and getting a kick out of taking someone's free will away from them. It's really fucked up when you think about it. I mean, rape is fucked up no matter how much thought you give it but it's REALLY fucked up when you think about why people actually do it.&&He did buy, he gave movie roles and launched the careers of many of his victims.&&because rape is not about sex exclusively, it's about exerting power and victimizing &&> It also demonstrates how selfish people can be because no one is Hollywood wanted to report on this open secret for years.

This is what bothers me so much about everyone in Hollywood piling into the MeToo movement now that it's safe to do so. Where the fuck was Meryl Streep 2 years ago? Did she not have enough clout to start things then?

I understand new actors trying to break into the industry wouldn't want to upset the apple cart. But other heavy hitters don't deserve to get their asses kissed for wearing black to an event when they were silent for so long. It would've taken 5 phone calls for people to say ""hey I heard Weinstein really crossed the line with X, let's say something."" They're just insincerely capitalizing on a trend for publicity.&&And the chances of Cosby actually doing time are low. His lawyers will stall and appeal til he dies or he’ll just pull a Polanski. &&Open the floodgates!!&&After a second trial in which case there were numerous accusers willing to step up.

FTFY&&Bill Cosby is black - there’s that whole thing going on there with the American judicial system.

In addition, i’m willing to bet any amount of money that Harvey Weinstein knows the worst dirt on a lot of very rich and very powerful people, can use that as leverage.&&I’ll be very surprised if Cosby does even 1 day inside prison. &&Yeah but that old blind fuck won't see a day in prison.

&&I’ve no idea man, I think this is the first time he’s going to court. I remember reading something about the 90s and that Harvey paid someone to shut up, don’t recall who&&My guess anyone working under him didn't want to burn any bridges and remain employed and people afraid of any backlash from announcing anything.

(The quote for icons is a reference to Lisa Bloom, who was a famed  women's rights while she secretly enabled Weinstein's worst abuses with NDAs.

She's been rightly shunned thus far.)&&It could be more difficult than you think when the environment you created for yourself is one where it’s all about you, everyone pawns at you to be in your movies, you lose self control, live for nothing but yourself, believe you’re more important and worthy than anyone else (and therefore think your needs have a right to be met), and think you’re untouchable. 

Sexual crimes are rarely about sex, but often about compulsion or power or any number of other things.

But that's just how my parents did things.&&No mention of vaginal sex?&&Criminal prosecution works the way it does because the theory is that crime harms society as a whole, in addition to the individual victim. So a public prosecutor litigates the case and can seek punishments designed to keep the community safe, like incarceration, fines paid to the government, or even the death penalty. 

It's a bit messy because criminal courts can order restitution, where the criminal pays money to the victim to make the victim whole. Also, crime victims can have an attorney to represent them in a civil case  to try to recover money for the damage caused by the crime. It's essentially two separate layers of punishment for the same act. If someone assaults you, it could be a crime punishable by imprisonment or fines to cover the cost of the public having to prosecute the crime. But it can also be a violation of civil law (which is seen as less serious than criminal assault and is therefore easier to prove) that entitles you to money to cover, say, medical bills and emotional distress.

There is a lot of history behind how this system came to be this way. It wasn't always this way. Until around the 1200s in England, crimes could be prosecuted privately by the victim. The punishment was a monetary fine paid to the victim. Physical punishment like hanging or incarceration was not the standard. The law gradually evolved for reasons that are too complex to get into. If you're curious, a Google search for ""criminal prosecutor origin"" or ""public prosecutor origin"" turns up some very informative articles. &&And there's no goddamn way he's Woody Allen's son. That's Frank Sinatra's kid. I mean, just look at him! Plus, both Woody and Mia have said its possible.

 &&>Farrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen.[68][69] Farrow later commented, ""He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.""[70]

Wow, that would be such a bizarre situation to be in.&&Ronan was also one of the *only* people who could have written this story. Weinstein has *reach* in ways that normal people can't really understand. His movies spend billions on advertising in aggregate. He knows every high level media person in existence. He is a careful donor to political causes, including DAs, senators, congresscritters. To say he is ""well connected"" is an understatement. 

Ronan is as close to Hollywood Royalty as one can get. His is financially secure and nearly as well connected as Harvey. He wasn't doing this to get rich, he couldn't be silenced, he couldn't be ignored, he's too enmeshed in Hollywood/New York power structures to have his stories quashed like happened to so many others. He's also well known as a bit of a savant, with extremely credible credentials. Lastly, he's a white (Jew-ish) dude, and this gives him tremendous credibility as someone who's inside this story, so to speak, in a way that very few other people are. Whistleblowers are more powerful than muckrakers sometimes. 

It's a really interesting lesson actually, and shows the fucked up nature of the media.&&I listened to an interview with him. His achievements are insane. He started college at 11. He sounded like the real life version of Smart Guy.&&His [interview with Terry Gross](https://www.npr.org/2018/05/23/613495834/ronan-farrow-i-was-raised-with-an-extraordinary-sense-of-public-service) this week was really interesting.  He seemed surprisingly grounded for someone who’s led such an unusual, and exceptional life.  &&Ronan is wicked smaht&&His daddy is Frank Sinatra, not Woody Allen. At some point, it's ridiculous to keep up the lie.&&It’s a double layered reference. Hannibal Buress’s standup drew attention to Cosby which lead to the three and a half year fallout.

Thanks so much for this link; what a perfect way to start my Memorial Day Weekend. 

Have a fine one, reddit!&&Pretty much everything he does is gold.&&Wow, what a fucking beautiful song! Thanks so much posting!&&LYRICS:
The books you think I wrote are way too thick.
Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn't be a dick?
And I don't watch you when you sleep.
Surprisingly, I don't use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep.

You're not going to heaven.
Why the fuck would you think Id ever kick it with you?
None of you are going to heaven.
There's a trillion aliens cooler than you.

You shouldn't abstain from rape just because you think that I want you to.
You shouldn't rape because rape is a fucked up thing to do.

I don't think masturbation is obscene.
Its absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen.
You make my job a living hell.
I sent gays to fix overpopulation and boy did that go well.

You're not going to heaven.
Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns.
None of you are going to heaven.
You're not my children you're a bad games of Sims.

You shouldn't abstain from pork just 'cause you think that I want you to.
You can eat pork, because why the fuck would I give a shit?

You argue and you bicker and you fight.
Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night
over what they think is true.
But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you.

You pray so badly for heaven,
knowing any day might be the day that you die
but maybe life on earth could be heaven.
Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth the try?

My love is the type of thing that you have to earn
And when you earn it, you won't need it. (2x)

I'm not going to give you love just 'cause I know that you want me to.
If you want love then the love is gonna come from you.&&I love the quick intro in this one&&Keep in mind that what he defines as “consensual” meaning he didn’t actually used physical force, was still using a power disparity to get sexual favors out of people who were not interested in him sexually nor in providing them. Just because he didn’t hold them down when he “asked for” a massage or oral or whatever, he was still using power in a coercive way, either as a carrot (getting movie deals and promotion) or stick (being  dumped from movies he had any influence over, badmouthed to the rest of the industry, and harassed by his lawyers and goons if they looked like they were trying to speak out).

So he already had a very coercive and transactional mental model for sex. He felt entitled to it because of all the good he could do for peoples careers, it was coin of his realm.

When you are a king and the ignorant peasants won’t cough up their taxes, you take it by force. Then you are into what Whoopi so charmingly called “rape-rape” but it’s a much shorter step if you see all sex as a quid pro quo that you are owed, especially if you are not the kind of attractive that an A List  Hollywood woman would otherwise normally look twice at.

So keep that in mind when he and his flacks try to differentiate these charges from all the “consensual” encounters he does not deny. If he thinks those were truly consensual, he doesn’t have any understanding of where the line actually is anyway. Or more likely, he does but can’t admit it to himself because then he would have to recognize he is exactly the scumwaffle everyone thinks he is.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&https://i.imgur.com/Ek4G8yx.gif&&Well hello there&&r/prequelmemes FOREVER &&I'll try ~~spinning~~  respecting other human beings, that's a good trick&&[deleted]&&I wonder if this will start another big wave in the #metoo movement. I would imagine seeing Weinstein turn himself in on all these charges (not to mention Cosby being found guilty), it may give a lot more people the courage needed to open up and like we've seen, so much of this has the power to snowball and get some serious momentum. &&No silt strider man noooooooo&&What *is* it outlander?&&For some people, the greatest turn on is power over someone. That kind of rape is sexual for the attacker, make no mistake. That’s why rape in prison happens between heterosexual males.&&To be fair, Meryl Streep still isn't against Harvey (as far as I'm aware), she just stopped defending him.&&The point of the me too movement was to make it safe to confront the rapists and sexual harassers in public. 

It’s like unions. By yourself you’re nothing and can be written off easily but if everyone stands together it’s harder to ignore them. 

Not that people don’t still demean them, obviously. Most people can’t even ask their boss for a raise but everyone expected actors and actresses to accuse their millionaire boss who had an unholy amount of power of something they can be sued for slander for saying. &&We're all just crabs in a bucket&&Actors are only as good as their next job. &&When has Hollywood ever not been hypocritical? They constantly bash on guns yet they are more than fond of using them to sell tickets and have armed security at every event. They lecture us with the Me To movement yet their entire casting couch culture epitomizes the worst of it. Their entire industry is a concentration of some of the most morally bankrupt messed up people that exist and they will sit there and lecture the average american.&&I feel you but what could they actually do? They didn’t have any proof, just things that they had heard.&&BUT HE DOESNT HAVE A PLANE, ASSHOLE!&&What'd Polanski do?&&Bill Cosby doesn't have the advantage of being a citizen of a country that wont extradite him.&&Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Cosby's age plays to his advantage. Cosby is 80 years old, and I'm not sure if Cosby's health issues only include him going legally blind. He's been found guilty of 3 charges, 10 years max on each charge, with an ultimate maximum of 30 years. If they go with even just the maximum for each, served concurrently, he has a good chance of dying in jail. The average age of death for an African American man is about 70 years. Statistically speaking, he's pushing it.

Weinstein is 66 and white. He's got more time.

(For anyone wondering, [race/ethnicity does matter here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6335a8.htm). There is a divide between  the average age of death for Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black individuals in the US, with women outliving men by about 5 years within each specific demographic. Life expectancy has been rising overall for years, but reports over time have shown the race and gender discrepancy remains.&&He said, they said*&&This is hardly a heresay thing.  The dude went to a facility to fix his sexual deviency which will be used against him in the prosecution.  Countless witness testimony to his abhorent behavior.  This is totally a slam dunk and he knows it.&&This. Being in the public eye isn't the pinnacle of wealth and power. The guy rubbed shoulders with ex presidents, he's less likely to do time for something like this than a movie star.&&Underselling a little is an understatement (lol). Take a look at his filmography. This man had a *huge* amount of pull in Hollywood.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein#Selected_filmography&&I'm a huge movie fan and have known about the Weinstein brothers forever but i never knew what they looked like. &&/u/trashpandarevolution I completely agree with you. But until this happened and his name was everywhere... I would bet anything that 60% of people (not involved in Hollywood or making movies) didn’t know who he is. &&I found it. He got out of it last time, and the girl in question was wearing a wire to record him:


https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-wont-face-charges-after-groping-report-manhattan-prosecutor-says.html&&Some of them, sure. But if there's one person like Harvey weinstein, there's probably more, and they probably hung out together&&It also really wasn't necessarily their business to tell. We now know [Brad Pitt knew about it](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2018/05/24/gwyneth-paltrow-says-brad-pitt-threatened-kill-harvey-weinstein-after-she-was-allegedly-harassed/pqfqoSh8PcBvqluUodQCCO/story.html) to a degree but it was Gwyneth Paltrow's story to tell not his. I mean that doesn't explain why he signed on to Inglourious Basterds knowing the money behind it was disgusting but that's a different discussion.&&She's also Gloria Allred's daughter for those who aren't aware.

She doesn't really care about these people. She just takes these high profile cases to get her name in the papers, same thing her mother has always done.&&I wonder about these NDAs. Since now it seems that several of the women who signed them may have technically broken them, does this open the door for him to counter sue his victims who breached the contract? I mean, you can sue anyone for anything for the most part, but what I mean is, is it possible he could actually *win* a lawsuit against a rape victim because they broke their NDA?&&this is a good point. Be an immensely powerful man who can coerce high status women and probably get away with it, then you can claim the moral high ground for not acting that out.

But sitting there from a place of a weakness like, ""I can't possibly imagine doing this thing I will never have the option of doing"", that's a petty worthless way to pat yourself on the back. Look for moral choices that are actually open to you, and judge yourself by those.

Not saying Harv isn't a scumbag&&Omar's comin', yo'! It's Omar!&&Weinstein sexually harassed Mira Sorvino while she was dating Quentin Tarantino. She told Tarantino. &&I'm just a nobody who occasionally reads celebrity gossip and even I'd heard about it. Everyone in Hollywood knew he was a creep who'd done some shit \- I don't believe anyone who says they had no idea. Most people probably didn't know how deep it went, though.&&Yes.&&I hope he is too but he's essentially relinquished himself from the public spotlight since these allegations arose, I guess so people would simply forget about him. He was supposed to be directing the new Queen biopic but was fired a few months ago. Since then, nobody has heard a peep.&&Yeah apparently pyro from the 2nd X-men was one of his victims &&The big rumor is that he harassed and/or raped members of the teenage cast in X men 2.

He will just write them a check for the full amount.&&Of course the rich always get preferential treatment, but I still like the idea of Harvey Weinstein learning how to cook a grilled cheese on a prison radiator.&&I love how a prequel meme is integrated so smoothly here that other people just keep commenting and everything makes sense.&&Huh! I should think that you Miramaxers would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and... heh heh heh...

After the trial and sentencing... who knows. I'd say there is a 30% chance he gets jail time.
&&That's his bail. He has to pay a million bucks and have an ankle bracelet so he can be out during the pendency or the case. &&That sounds like bond to me, not a sentence. &&General BadlyTimedQuoti&&the important language there is this:  Without such person's consent, which is withheld for some other reason than incapacity to consent.

And no, i'm not sure, but second degree rape is for victims under 15 or who are mentally handicapped.   First degree rape requires that you rape by ""forcible compulsion"" -- compelling the victim through the use of physical force or the threat of immediate death, physical injury or kidnapping.  (that or the victim is physically helpless, or a child).  

Seems to me that what he is MOST likely guilty of here is using his influence and authority to say ""do this or you'll never work in this town again"".   But I don't know the details.  if he used physical force or threatened physical harm, then that bumps it up.  &&OwO wuts did&&Yeah, that part makes sense, but it's a LOT worse.  Like it can add a decade or more onto a 4 year charge.  that's a lot more than I'd have guessed. &&thanks!  it's not a shock at this point that law enforcement knows a shit ton more about the charges than me. that first degree is pretty hard to prove in new york, but I wish them luck.

Think of your job and think of your boss or imagine the gatekeeper to your industry.  An industry that you have dreamt of for years, one that has required quite a bit of sacrifice. 

Now that gatekeeper is pretty much everything you hate physically and personality wise.  

And that person says hey, you want in, suck my herpes dick.  You want to ever work in this industry fuck my cottage cheese pussy. 

Otherwise you'll be blacklisted for decades and your small slice of time (female actresses don't last long before the new 22 year olds come along) is gone.

Some people just don't get it. That yes they could've said no, but it would've been the end of their career as they know it or in some case a career over before it even started. 

They just don't see the power difference and it's kind of hard to fathom the amount of power someone has to have to be able to do that.

But hey, we haven't even hit the pedophiles of Hollywood yet.  That fallout, that will be on a whole different level. &&Good post. Great post actually. &&I agree that there is a spectrum of definitions of consent, and that many other things besides physical actions can coerce someone into having a sex. However, it also becomes a murky area because everyone will have different opinions on how money, influence, age, etc. affects the power dynamic between two people having a sexual encounter. Regardless, I still think at the core, he knew the immoral game he was playing and got off on it. 

I think he and his team are making the differentiation for legal reasons, as the possible quid pro quo encounters are much harder to convict.

you pay a bondsman 10% of your bail, and the bondsman swears that you'll make it to court

if you don't show to court, the bondsman sends bounty hunters after you&&Easy to explain for laypeople.

Basically they set bail on a few factors but one of the major ones is how much of a flight risk you are (meaning what is the chance you'll just fuck off after bail and evade the law and go on the run).

It can be argued, and is sometimes, that bail should be denied certain people because they are just far too likely to fuck off.

So once it's decided someone gets bail, the question is how much. Basically there are a ton of factors that go into it, but they try to make it, from my layperson understanding, high enough such that it the person wouldn't want to sacrifice losing.

If it was too low, if some new information came out that the person was much more likely to get convicted, there would be a higher flight risk. So they try and set it somewhere such that you really can't just say ""ah well fuck the bail money"".

How they set it though is a bit more complicated, depends on how much you earn and shit I think and a ton of other random factors I don't remember.&&Bail means that you aren’t remanded in custody until the date of your trial. This obviously makes sense because you haven’t been convicted yet. However, you can be denied bail based on the extent to which you are considered a flight risk. Sometimes, to reduce the risk of a defendant fleeing, they will have to pay a bond that they only get back if they show show up for trial.

Holy fuck, this is the greatest news I've heard in a while. I love Bo and didn't know he had anything coming out soon. Can't fucking wait for that. (I assume this is based off of his screenplay ""Gay Kid and Fat Chick"" from a few years ago, which was fantastic!)&&Right, but that isn’t necessarily a poorly written law but one written in a way to be enforceable only under very specific circumstances. If we went from defining rape as sexual assault with violence or under threat of violence to defining rape where there is a “power imbalance” between two people who have a sexual encounter (or some other similar criteria) that would open up the playing field to all kinds of issues.

As this regards Weinstein, I’m glad they’re leveling charges because it sounds like, at least in some instances, what he did amounted to legal rape. However, I think that has less to do with the writing of the law and more to do with the fact that a rich and influential person used his power to escape enforcement of the law for many years.&&Which reminds me, how's your mom doing?&&Don't need a passport if you don't use an airport. &&Also 70% of Americans are obese or overweight.

This case has been so well publicized and he so vilified, I can’t imagine a judge having the stones to give him 2 years probation and a fine.

The DA wants hard time on a violent crime so they settle on say 8 yrs in medium security all sentences to run concurrently.

If that happens there will be a civil lawsuit against him where he will probably end up owing damages to the victims.  

The reason civil is usually done is because it is very hard to get a criminal conviction on most sexual assault cases, since it's beyond reasonable doubt to find a person guilty.  Civil is worked out by the person most likely did it and damages would be assigned to the victim.        &&He might see a bit of jail time but will likely get off on house arrest after shoveling over many millions in court fees and settlements and what not.

It’s also one of the first (and possibly still best) hard sci fi films. 

I think it’s worth your time if you like movies and can find a theater that’s playing it. You do have to invest some energy into it though. You can’t just sit there with a bag of popcorn. For better or worse, it’s one of those movies where you will walk out asking yourself “wtf did I just watch”.

It’s also a phenomenal blu ray example. The colors, models, shots all hold up today and look great on a good hd tv.&&That’s exactly what I’m doing. I’ve always put off watching it but I’m seeing it this Sunday in 70mm. Pretty excited!&&If you are going to see this for the first time you should be warned about the parts of the film that haven’t aged well. 

Before the downvote brigade commences, this is one of my favorite movies so please don’t tell me why I’m wrong. 

When it came out, there had never been SFX of this level. Because of that, there are some places where the movie lovingly dwells on things like a spaceship docking with a spinning station. Sometimes like two minute long, beautiful sequences set to classical music. 

If someone put that in a film today, 15 seconds in you’d be looking around wondering if something was about to explode, or what was hidden on the edges of the screen, or whatever. 

This isn’t that. It’s ships. In space. That look REAL. It was something to marvel over and Kubrick attacks it with his normal love of detail, so just enjoy it. 

In a similar way, there are some plot concepts that are belabored in the film that modern movies would just hand wave because nobody thinks twice about what being on a ship would be like. 

One other thing to note; virtually unlike any film ever this movie was made in conjunction with the book instead of after it. It’s really worth reading the book before or after the film. Arthur Clarke talks about the mechanics of it all in fascinating detail; Kubrick shows it to you in all of its glory. &&As others mentioned, it's a movie that you kinda soak in.

The enormous rotating space station interior was one that always astounded me. (and still does)

It also had a look-and-feel that seems to have strongly influenced the Alien franchise (another important milestone in movie history)&&I watched it as a kid and I thought of it as the same as Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. Crazy this film was made **before** we landed on the moon! &&No joke, they showed a trailer of this remastered version in the theater and I heard people behind me talking and they thought it was a remake because of how good it looks.&&Go to http://2001spaceodysseymovie.com&&Jesus. This is one of the last movies I'd watch tripping balls. &&Only like a 10 minute sequence.&&I watched it clean, when I was around 18yo. Gosh I never felt that bored in my life&&It actually didnt fare well in the theaters until people started figuring out if you drop acid right at a certain point in the film, it was epic. Then it kind of took off. &&Any Sci\-Fi movie before 2001: A Space Odyssey is an awful cheesy cheap looking B movie. 

9 years after 2001, we got Star Wars. 2001 paved the way for big budget Sci\-Fi movies, and in turn the blockbuster cinema mentality we got with that. 

It's without a doubt one of the most influential movies in the history of cinema. &&Not only what the poster above said, but it made Sci-Fi movies more introspective, more philosophical and less concentrated on the “aliens” or such. It basically allowed sci-fi to go from a fight/relationship with aliens to “let’s use extraterrestrial worlds/concepts to examine ourselves”. The full impact of this is seen in movies such as The Arrival.&&The visuals were (and still look) insane and pretty much SHOWED the story insted of telling it; its very philosophical, compare to so many other movies (mostly sci-fi) theres no villian or bad guy in it and it doesnt treat its audience as idiots&&From a cinematic POV yes, it's extremely well filmed.  However, it is an extremely slow movie to sit to.  

I would definitely watch it as it will always remain one of those top movies of all time.  &&Its a great film, but its intensely slow. If you have the patience to watch a beautifully shot film that doesn't do anything with any sense of urgency, then give it a watch. &&It’s good if you see the impact it made, and are a big fan of old movies. If you’ll be watching it for the first time, unless you’re a huge film buff it will probably be extremely boring and leave you asking wtf you just watched. &&An unpopular opinion, but I really don't care for it. The pacing is pretty poor and they spend way too much time on slow panning shots.  For me it also didn't have the narrative power of a lot of Kubrick's other films. This was the first of his I saw, and for years I didn't give him a chance because I felt this film was so overrated. The I watched A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket.&&Objectively speaking, yeah it’s a pretty good movie. For the time the effects and shots they got were insane and pretty much paved the way for sci fi.

That being said... I’ve watched it on three separate occasions and have fallen asleep at the same spot each time. It’s a slow movie. I really enjoy good dialogue, and seeing how there is very little of that, it’s not a movie for me.&&Match cut, not jump cut

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_cut&&I hadn't seen this before....  pure genius.&&While I sort of agree, it's also one of the most overrated films of all time.&&>I feel strongly that you could cut out a good half of the movie and tell the same story but better. :/

I appreciate you sharing your thoughts \- can you say what you think the story of the film is?&&> a lot of sets/ideas that captivated audiences at the time

There's your answer.&&It’s like watching paint dry, but the paint is a fresh Rembrandt. It’s boring but pretty, and the ideas inspired people so they think the film is good. &&It is more like sci-fi literature than today's sci-fi films. It's not for everyone but it is definitely a masterpiece regardless of what era you watch it in. It's like Ulysses (except of course to a lesser extent) - fairly objectively a masterpiece, but pretty understandable if you don't like it. &&> but I still don't get the hype around this movie.  
  
There is nothing to get. Art is in the eyes of the beholder. Every opinion is slightly different.  
  
Some people like this movie a lot, some people don't care for it at all. I've given up on trying to understand other peoples' opinions of art, because I think there is just something fundamentally different about how we each perceive & value the things in our world.   
  
>it was objectively a bad movie  
  
I don't really think this is a thing. There's probably some context or some way of thinking that could support some value in just about anything. And I've seen a lot of movies I really hated or thought were really lazy or poorly done, and even liked some movies that were really derivative and didn't seem to do anything new or say anything important. But objectively bad? Just because I and even almost everyone hates something, doesn't mean even one lonely person is wrong for liking it. 

&&It isn't an objectively bad movie, but it doesn't have a narrative that is designed to sustain an action film pace. Instead what it offers is a profound and moving and (literally) mindblowing experience of the discovery of something genuinely new in the world. It gives you the feeling of being there in a moment where what it means to be human is transformed forever.

It's more like an art film than a Hollywood film, albeit one of the greatest and most influential art films ever made. But still, you have to be in the mood for it (or stoned).&&> I'm normally a huge fan of deeply story oriented sci-fi

This is the problem is that Kubrick wasn’t a very story oriented director.   He was very visual, and generally tried to evoke emotion. 

Similar to David Lynch without much of the surrealism.  Nobody walked away from this movie, or The Shining saying “wow what an innovative plot” &&I can understand if you find the overall story boring but from a film making perspective this film is incredible. Every shot and scene is amazing to watch. Even the start with the protohumans has amzingly beautiful shots.&&I was just going to say the same thing. The style of this doesn't match the style of the movie IMO

&&>I think it’s worth your time if you like movies and can find a theater that’s playing it. You do have to invest some energy into it though. You can’t just sit there with a bag of popcorn. For better or worse, it’s one of those movies where you will walk out asking yourself “wtf did I just watch”.

I saw it in 70 mm at the Lightbox in Toronto not really knowing anything about the movie. Wow! You're right \- really slow, but really, really cool just to soak in.&&One of the first movies my step-dad rented when we first got a VHS back in the 80s. Then, proceeded to fast forward through all the long sequences with classical music and no dialog.  He was also the type to complain about ""all the black bars on the TV"".  
Taught me a lot about not ever watching movies with him.&&It is slow, and the first time I saw it, I kept wondering when the action was going to start. I was a kid when Star Wars came out, so I was expecting something along the same lines. I also had seen 2012 prior to 2001, which is a good but different type of movie from 2001.

That said, I still love it. I think first timers should go in with the same mindset as you would browsing through an art museum for a couple of hours. It starts slowly, but it's still pretty gripping, so it's not boring, and it eventually does have plenty of intense moments. &&What's a hard sci fi?&&How did it ""change all movies forever""? &&What's unique about the film (or rare at least) is that the plot of the film takes place above the head of any individual character.  They have their conflict and their story play out, but none of them know the larger context, only you do.  That's where the movie derives it's sense of theme and idea.  The movie knows you won't understand parts of it, and that's entirely the point.  It's a movie about beyond what you can comprehend.&&[deleted]&&The lingering shots I think were meant more to convey the vast loneliness and emptiness of space than than showing off the cool VFX (Space Mutiny does that pretty well)&&>If someone put that in a film today, 15 seconds in you’d be looking around wondering if something was about to explode, or what was hidden on the edges of the screen, or whatever. 

It kind of sucks how quickly most modern films move on from stuff like this - even slower films like blade runner 2049 have many shots where I want to get a closer look at something interesting but it just cuts away from it right as I'm starting to get what's going on in the shot. 

I really like how Kubrick gives us time to absorb everything going on in a shot and appreciate all the work that goes into it.&&> the movie lovingly dwells on things like a spaceship docking with a spinning station. 

 It's to give you time to appreciate the space porn of that lovely ship (which years before the space shuttle looks like a classy streamlined passenger version of the space shuttle) fucking the equally lovely Bonstellesque spinning ring space station.
&&I recently re-watched *Aliens*. I remember thinking every minute of it was exciting as a kid when it came out. Because it really was. Everything looked so realistic. But there's like 20 minutes of action in the entire 2 hour movie. I don't see most modern audiences as being thrilled by that. It's just not surprising or even very interesting that sci-fi movies now take place in extremely realistic-looking and detailed worlds. You just expect it, so they don't really dwell on it anymore.  &&I agree. In a college literature class, we watched a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play. The professor explained something that I had never realized. He said the reason older films sometimes seem boring is the camera cuts. 

Older movies held the camera on the same thing much longer than modern ones. In modern movies and TV, the camera shows a different angle about every 3 or 4 seconds, even during the same scene. Closeup of person speaking/wide shot of both people/closeup of person listening/back to the speaker/reaction of listener/different angle of both people, etc., all in less than a minute.

Kubrick spends a lot of time on the details from the same angle, and I think that's why some people say it moves slowly. I think it gives the audience more of a ""fly on the wall"" perspective, though, like you're really there and watching it unfold in real time. 

The only way to properly enjoy it is to go in with zero expectations, and just let it unravel at its own pace. I would love to see this on a big screen with theater sound.

One thing I think has aged well is the AI (never more relevant than today), and a lot of the other technology predictions that we actually have today. It's not all Star Trek-y with beam-ups and ray guns, but rather very realistic portrayals of what could actually exist. Some of it is still very far off from happening, if ever, but it's tangible enough to maintain the suspension of disbelief.

Also, the main characters are perfectly cast. They actually look and act like real astronauts. The sixties decor is a mix of dated and retro, but it still looks cool, kind of like Mad Men.&&I disagree. This is an absolute masterpiece of film because of Kubrick. Clarke was a great SciFi writer but the film transcends genre and the book is inferior to the scope and majesty of the film. 

To give a couple examples, no writing in the book can compare to the visual of the most famous dissolve in film history, from the bone to the space station. And like a scifi writer would, Clarke makes the monoliths machines, instead of the pure symbols they are in the film. The book is ok, the film is genius. &&To me those slow spaceship waltzes are still some of the most beautiful parts of the movie. They haven't aged badly. Their slow grace suggests human scales of space and time meeting the vastness of the cosmos, humans finally embracing this vastness as their own, the great cosmic dance meeting the particularity of a 19th century human waltz and turning out to be the same thing. Which is to say, I like those bits.&&[deleted]&&This is something that also applies to the first Star Trek movie. People now complain that its so slow, so many shots of just the ship in spacedock, etc.  They're forgetting that back when it was released, Star Trek had only ever been on a small screen, in a series that was no stranger to reusing shots of the Enterprise.

I'm old enough to have seen Star Trek The Motion Picture in a theater, and let me tell you - Trekkie's were *eating that up.* From a small little image on our TV reruns, to a glorious 30 foot tall screen, this was the Enterprise like it had never been seen. Shit, people *applauded* after some of those long spaceship shots.&&Woody Allen said that the first time he saw 2001 he didn't like it.  The second time he saw it he warmed up a bit to it.

I was so salty considering I was the only one who didn’t use Movie Maker/iMovie to put it together and I still think it was pretty fuckin solid.

Are they screening a 4K master or literally just putting a UHD disc in a projection booth and hitting play?

Because a 4K digital master is still going to be better than a UHD disc.

Also if they did all the color timing chemically, as everything here suggests, then sure they have time to do a 4K scan. Just take a pristine print and run it through a scanner. Poof. Done.

However, as much innovation as Kubrick crammed into 2001, there are likely many movies which made no use of any of them.&&This poster is embarrassing.  &&Oh good. The website follows shitty design practices as well as this poster. Why would you immediately open with a video overlay? &&They really were. There's an Adam Savage video that goes into it a bit.

what part of the movie in particular?

just curious &&It was re-marketed with the tag line “the ultimate trip” once theaters realized people were coming in to view the film while tripping &&Also it directly inspired a generation of filmmakers, notably Christopher Nolan who did his own homage with Interstellar and his practical effects for the hallway scene in Inception.&&You also have to remember that NASA was only founded in 1958 and human in space was still new. Rocket Ship XM, Destination Moon, When Worlds Collide, Towards the Unknown, and a few others were fairly serious takes or less cheesy one that helped 2001 get made I think. Sadly most of those got covered up by space men from mars and the like. Kubrick had done some stellar films that involved human elements and often showed the darker or more comical side of humanity. 

His camera work was due in large part to his experimentation as a photographer and his many different genres of film work. In a way 2001 was his only scifi film (AI was his brain child of course) and most of his movies were based on book series, but he made them all his own. &&It seemed like it may have influenced most genre films as something that could be taken seriously. &&For comparison, the next most well regarded space-epic prior to 2001, was Forbidden Planet. That came out more than a decade earlier, and while it had some impressive props, sets and matte paintings, it was no where near 2001.&&I know you're exaggerating slightly to get the point across, and A Space Odyssey did have a major effect on how seriously sci-fi movies were able to be taken, but I think it's a bit unfair to call any sci-fi movie before it a B-movie. There were still some great sci-fi movies that came out before it. Metropolis, Alphaville, Gojira, La Jetee, etc.&&I understand this as ""hard sci-fi"", like Solaris, Dark Star, Gattaca, Primer, Moon. The genre had previously existed in novels like Solaris and short stories from Asimov like Evidence, but 2001 really brought it to the blockbuster stage.

I like how some cross over, like Gravity is a three act exploration of Sandra Bullock's character's grief over the loss of her daughter but is often passed over for its Buzz Lightyear cameo. Total Recall makes us ask questions about what we can know to be true but dresses it in an 80s action movie robe.&&Metropolis and Alphaville both predate it and did what you’re saying about 2001.&&Is it really that slow?

I was going to suggest to my girlfriend that we watch this together, but she tends not to enjoy extremely slow movies, gets bored.  

Some examples of movies she found boring: The Lost City of Z, Silence, You Were Never Really Here.&&Watch the PAL version, its faster.&&This movie is like the original Blade Runner for me. Beautiful aesthetics with great ideas that will go on to inspire the next generation of filmmakers, but I'm pretty much just watching these movies once and then never again.

Incredibly slow, incredibly boring, it's a struggle to stay awake during a lot of it.&&I honestly have never been able to sit through the full length of the movie in one sitting. I think I’ve seen the whole movie but only when I happen to be channel surfing and I watch it for a bit.&&I really don’t like this movie either. It’s so insufferably *boring*. I get it’s impact on all future cinema, especially sci-fi, but that still doesn’t make it enjoyable to sit through.&&*Dr. Strangelove* and *The Shining* are my favorite Kubrick films, along with *2001*.&&How can you ""sort of agree"" that it's one of the best films ever yet find it overrated?&&That's a little complicated wouldn't you say? There's a lot of layers to to the cake of that movie. I guess to avoid dodging your question I'd point to the main one that stuck with me: The transformation of the human spirit and experience as it intersects with technology and the unknown. The main character plot didn't stick with me all that well from the few years ago I watched it.

I'll clarify that I'm not talking about cutting out scenes entirely so much as shortening some of them (I'm looking at you hour of monkeys scenes). I feel the ideas/concepts/scenes/visuals/story and other aspects of the film could have all been delivered more effectively if the pacing didn't feel quite so dragged out. I'm not asking for action-pace here either.&&[removed]&&>It’s like watching paint dry, but the paint is a fresh Rembrandt.

Stealing this. &&That was probably hyperbolic of me in hindsight - I just feel like reddit fanboys for this movie really hard. The impression is given that it's this wonderful, captivating, entertaining film and it's not. It's an art piece with components to appreciate for their own right. Not everyone needs to see it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be watched all the way through from start to finish. &&>literally&&That's a fair point, but I think that also just lends credence to my point that the pace and plot of the movie were poorly constructed.

Edit: So I guess this was a ""true photochemical recreation"" of the film. But clearly, something went wrong. There's no way Kubrick wanted the halls of the Renaissance room to be blue. 

I mean, the fucking monolith is gray.....&&The interpositive was re\-created from the negatives using a wet\-gate transfer... this is how Criterion does remasters \(whenever possible\).  I'm sure that Nolan used whatever information was at his disposal to match the original print’s color timing.

Basically sold out for a grade, but I got excellent grades on all of those because my teacher thought it seemed more professional.               

Anyway, my point is that it looks like they took the movie and threw the grading on it the same way I did back in high school. Abysmal&&1) The Notebook was obviously inspired by the love story between HAL and Dr. Bowman.  The way that HAL slowly fades away to a song before he is about to die was a direct inspiration for the dance scene of the Notebook before her memory begins to slip away yet again.

2) Suicide squad is obviously a rip off of the terrible hominid costumes and their use of weapons to defeat a faceless hero (the black monolith). I mean really, do you even remember who the enemy was in Suicide Squad?

3) The Emoji movie...try explaining the plot of the Emoji movie to someone. You'd have a better chance in explaining 2001.&&Heck, it should also go into its influence on A Birth of a Nation and Un Chien Andalou.  It did affect ALL films after all.&&If I were still working on my English major, I would accept this challenge.

Something about how HAL's journey of self\-discovery paved the way for Gene's story of seeking to become a normal emoji. It's no coincidence that Gene's roundness so clearly mimics the iconic image of HAL. And isn't it interesting that HAL's urgent red light has now been re imagined in Gene's yellow\-ness?

My mom said that she walked out of the theater thinking it was cool but really bizarre, but her friend sat down on the steps and cried because she believed that she had discovered true meaning and that her life would never be the same.

I'm pretty sure Kubrik was very conscious of how he could play on the... uh... state of mind of many young film goers at the time. &&And go into it with the context that this movie came out in 1968. I know we are getting to see it in theaters again, but we don't have the context of that timeframe. Pocket calculators weren't a thing. CGI wasn't even close to a thing. Still blows me away how the movie looks.&&So slow that the first time I saw it i somehow played the dvd in French and didn’t realize for like 45 minutes. Kept waiting for someone to speak English. Figured the guy was visiting a French station. &&""Then proceed to fast forward through all the long sequences with classical music and no dialogue"" If I understand this correctly, you watched 2 minutes and 23 seconds of the movie with your stepdad then ? &&Funny, my experience was similar but different. I recall renting the movie and we actually shut it off after about 15 minutes of apes barking.  We returned it because we thought they mixed up the tapes.&&One important thing to keep in mind throughout, which made it more fascinating for me, is that this movie was made in 1968. Some of the scenes look absolutely insane considering the technology they had at the time. It's all practical effects and a lot of ingenuity.&&Maybe I can watch it when I am stoned?&&Hard sci fi is taking scientific theories or concepts and portraying them in the most realistic way possible. The premise in 2001 is send some astronauts to Jupiter (we hadn’t even landed on the moon yet in 1968). So Kubrick wanted to show if we were to send astronauts to Jupiter, how would we realistically do that. Without sci fi movie conveniences. &&I imagine what he meant was that it's 100% sci-fi, rather than a relatively realistic setting with trace amounts of sci-fi shit sprinkled in and around the plot.&&Id like to see this point made with more than just saying it.&&*Slow* is not the right word to describe it, idk, maybe *static*? 

2001 is very experimental, most pivotal actions happen when nothing seems to happen. Like when (spoilers) HAL discovers the ploy to disable him after an error, or when HAL kills all the hibernating crewmembers, or even when Dave kills HAL. There are no dynamic actions in those scenes, no dramatic cues for the audience to tell what to feel, no soundtrack, or camera movement, or even acting and dialogue that translates the narrative weight of what we are seeing.

I'd say, my impression, is that we are watching humanity evolution thru the neutral lens of an alien entity, just as in Shining we are watching the Overlook by the 'ghosts' perspective. In both movies these watchful entities do seem to interfere somehow the events, for more indifferent they seem to be. 

&&I know it’s slow moving and a very different movie, but even if I don’t care for the storytelling side of it, the visuals alone will keep me occupied. I have high expectations as it’s considered one of the greatest films of all time, but I have mild expectations of me actually falling in love with it right away. But still I’m excited about the fact I’m seeing a movie like this on the big screen, in 70mm, and in a completely sold out showing&&I have to disagree with this. 

Kubrick went out of his way to so how deliberate and careful long distance manned space travel would be. I think a lot of the visuals were for vfx sake but also to teach the public this is how space really is (before 2001 all people had was Flash Gordon, lost in space, and B quality alien invasion movies). 

2001 was Kubrick saying, no this is space travel and I’m going to display how it would really work. So like showing how tedious and careful you have to be docking to a space station but keeping it light and playful by having the scene set to Strauss’ blue Danube waltz. So you have the hard sci fi element of the docking process but the playful whimsy of floating through space and those two things paint a great visual. 

*spoilers?*


Plus the whole movie goes against that space isn’t lonely. It’s revealed that we’re very much not alone. Without the help of aliens we wouldn’t have moved passed the stage of primitive apes. &&Well said and totally fair. Re-reading my comment I realize that I partially did not convey what I meant. SFX enabled this for the first time ever really, and Kubrick took advantage of it to show us all kinds of amazing shots.

A lot of that is totally passé now after 50 more years of it.  It just needs to be appreciated in the proper context. 

Edit to my addendum: Kubrick is the kind of filmmaker that wouldn’t use SFX or camera tricks just to show them off. But man was he a master of using every trick in the book to convey stuff. &&Agreed! This was one of the things that made The Matrix so intense when it came out. Bullet time allowed the Wachowskis to do some amazing stuff with slowing time down in the middle of action to let you soak everything in and really just appreciate the hell out of a shot, then snap back to real time. 

Of course it’s been abused a lot since then so even that is passé now. &&I wish I could see 2049 again in IMAX. Have the the theme song in my Outrun playlist and it still gives me chill bumps.&&Yeah, this is not about what's modern (in terms of advancement of craft or technology) but merely of current taste and, even then, only in mass-market populist fare.

There is a movement for more considered, slower-paced culture. See things like [slow tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) (as one expression of this) and long-form cable TV shows where stories take their time getting to where they're going, as well as people who are actively pushing against the impatience of modern culture, as in [Lynch's Twin Peaks: The Return.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnrcXzQOdLY)&&This is one of the reasons I like single player games I can play at a relatively controlled pace. I get to absorb more of the game. It's music, sound effects, voice acting, etc., but also the little details like Easter eggs, glitches, customization/mods, meta and unintentional humor; much of which happens through your own agency.

Movies, as much as I love them, just barely scratch the surface when it comes to world building. It's not the fault of the art, it's a fault of the medium. I was an extra in the last Bourne movie and the set I was on was a very real and carefully constructed place. The set was immaculately dressed with fake products with catchy, ironic names, we were all wearing professionally made costumes, Matt Damon was adorable to look at. Those things are not adequately displayed in the format of a single-angle, 2-D, linear experience&&Who needs action or realistic CGI when you have a set of wonderful actors and dialogs?&&Yeah we’re going to have to agree to disagree on that one. I find the book to be far superior for the very reason you list. There’s a reason those monoliths are there that is super central to the story and the movie fails to fully explore that. 

I think the movie is a masterpiece but the ending falls short. 

However, I will certainly and happily agree the dissolve you are referencing is the best in film history. &&Give him time. He might be too slow to&&To party&&Hey in his defense, he did say he was slow.&&*And everyone is doomed to die...*&&we live in a society&&Post it&&[deleted]&&POST IT&&It is pretty solid (don't know what happened to the Cera dialogue towards the end though). And if you look at modern movie marketing, the ""In a World"" type of narration hasn't really been used regularly for about 25 years now, so it sucks that you got docked points for that. I mean, even during the time that ""Superbad"" was released, it had already become campy and chintzy.

The key thing to look for (I've found) is the pacing and storytelling using the dialogue, and I think both are accomplished here. You did have a lack of material to work with, as Superbad does have action-y elements but not quite enough to convey full-on action, but you made it work. The one I specifically liked was the insertion of the ""grabbing money from the till"" shot. That's one that I think I'd normally have missed if building a trailer myself, but it adds to the final product with this one.

Anyway, thumbs up and glad you're doing it professionally now.

Summer 2018&&There are people who argue that Kubrick changed the cinematic language. There was a big sea change between studio movies before 2001 and after—how much of that was due to Kubrick, I dunno, but that is one of the arguments.

As to “language”: the forms of how scenes are composed and edited.  Just the way he edited to the soundtrack was different than most movies for example.&&For more about Shakespeare, I woukd recommend [Cunk on Shakespeare.](https://youtu.be/9YeCpHoy9EQ)&&Thanks for sharing that.&&TiL Kubrick planned on making a movie about Napoleon!

The whole movie is like this though. Super boring and slow for people who want the meaning handed to them.&&Because this is the Internet :/&&Daisy.  Daaisy... &&I would say before the movie starts.&&You haven't seen it have you?

If you have, it's that scene.&&*Interstellar* owes its existence entirely to *2001*, which is obvious to anyone who's seen both films.

And of course, the special effects of *2001* were a huge inspiration for George Lucas.&&Read ""Space Odyssey"" its a great book about the concepting, filming, etc of the movie. Its an incredible showcase of just how much was made and invented on the fly. Not to mention the challenges they overcame to produce certain shots. &&And is behind this new print and re-release.&&Yeah, it is really not just about sci-fi, and definitely not about blockbusters, it is about mastery of the art form. The Sistine Chapel or a Beethoven symphony aren't the basis for ""all"" art or music, but they are peaks that shows what is possible and inspire other artists  who also aspire to greatness.

2001 is a peak of film because it addresses the entire sweep of human history, from before human to what comes next, in images that are simultaneously exactingly realistic and fantastically creative. It's a masterpiece of art. That doesn't mean it is super popular or accessible, but it is important.    &&2001 is not really ""hard sci-fi"". It's more like the invention of a new religious myth.

The movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, of which about 90 minutes without a single word spoken. The first 30 minutes or so have absolutely no word spoken, and for a good reason.
2001 is a majestic movie. Go watch it, but just go to enjoy the voyage wherever it takes you. Don’t expect Star Wars, Dune, or even Blade Runner. &&To be honest she probably won't like it. &&There's no dialogue for about the first 15 minutes, that gives you a clue as to the pacing. It's one of my favourite films but if you don't like slow films you may find it tough work. &&Super slow. There's no real story until the middle. Then no story after.

-some 17 year old, probably&&Agreed. Most likely the blur was added after the fact to make the text readable.&&Because fuck you, that's why.&&So I had to scan through the blu-ray and compare shots to this theailer. The bathroom—what I think you’re calling the halls—*really is* that blue. The main bedroom is also blue, but a very light robin’s egg blue. All of that stuff looks identical to the blu-ray. 

There are four shots that look off to me, though: the two shots near the beginning where David Bowman is talking to HAL, and the shot of the empty pod bay are all *way* more saturated toward cyan and have higher contrast in this new trailer. Finally the shot of Bowman walking down the octagonal corridor is noticably warmer in this trailer than it is on the blu-ray. &&> Edit: So I guess this was a ""true photochemical recreation"" of the film. But clearly, something went wrong. There's no way Kubrick wanted the halls of the Renaissance room to be blue.

I know for a fact that Kubrick oversaw all the home video release transfers up until his death. That would mean everything up to the DVD release is exactly as he intended. The colors in this trailer do not match the DVD releases color timing.

Can confirm I felt the full range of human emotions throughout the film and wept at the end. The ending was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen...

I also vaguely remember watching the moon walk on our honking huge t.v. in our family room. We had lots of books and games with space themes growing up. Oh wow, I am remembering things I'd long forgotten now.

YES life is very different now. I just watched this again on a cross-country flight and it struck me just how different, yet how weirdly relevant today.

idunno. I saw 2001 for the first time in 2015 and I was blown the fuck away. A movie made in 1968 looks *like that?* Why did anyone bother making movies after that came out? It was already over, the best-looking thing to ever be filmed had already been filmed. hang it up.

I'll admit, it gets boring at times. But there are a lot of really great pieces of art that are boring. It's not the art's fault, it's just our own tastes that have been conditioned by post-Star Wars movies and TV. 
 &&It is a very good summary. I first watched 2001 in my late teens, and it bored the hell put of me.

I'm not sure if it's in this video, but at one point he was doing a period piece and wanted to film some scenes lit only by candle-light, but the tech didn't exist. Lenses at the time just couldn't absorb such little light in 1/24th of a second on the film he was using.

So, rather than tricking the shot or playing with alternatives somehow, he started looking for components that could possibly do it. He tracked down the last 3 unused ultra-wide Zeiss lenses that had been made for NASA to film the moon walk, bought all of those, tracked down antique reel cameras that could potentially fit to the massive lenses, bought as many as he could, and proceded to craft his own custom low light camera rigs. He did this without telling anyone what they were for to prevent being stopped, since he was basically using priceless artifacts for parts.

I’m pretty sure he didn’t if the trailer is to be believed.

The thing that pisses me off is that they had plenty of data for determining the proper grading/exposure. Kubrick took tens of thousands of medium format polaroids to check exposure and color and I’m certain those are in his archives.&&Got ‘em &&That would look way better

&&Undercover brother part 2&&This poster is fantastic. I think it shows exactly what the trailer does without showing anything. The tone and plot can both be seen here.&&Never thought I’d see Topher Grace’s name at the top of a movie poster again.&&No way this ends up being controversial &&Why does he call his films “joint”?&&Why does this film already have bad reviews from users who very likely haven't seen it?&&I think that this movie looks great and I really want to see it, but with that said I fucking hate Spike Lee with the fiery passion of a thousand sun's. 

The dude seems to think he can lecture everyone about hatred when he's openly said he gives interracial couples an angry look when he sees them. He also tweeted out the address of someone with the same name as George Zimmerman in the same area of the Trayvon Martin shooting and called upon his followers to go riot/attack him. This resulted in an innocent  persons having a mob outside his home. He has straight up advocated for hate in the past, all while preaching about white racism. Isn't a tenet of white racism hating on interracial couples? Gathering a mob to go do physical harm to someone based on racial motivations?

I'm sure people will get mad at me for having this opinion, but this dude just pisses me off. He says a post racial America is bullshit despite being a black millionaire who is beloved and respected by many Americans of all shades. And PS even I respect his filmmaking expertise despite hating the dude. Sorry to rant everyone just had to get it off my chest because I've seen him in the news so much. &&Spike Lee is a piece of crap, but for everyone whining about the *movie* itself being a racist message towards white people, [this movie is actually based off a true story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Stallworth).&&So I don't even have to read the thread to know that there will be a bunch of unoriginal references to the Chappelle Show &&This will be the first time some is going to pay money to see a spike lee movie in 25 years.&&I original read this as STAN LEE'S BLACKKKLANSMAN.

Ignore the fact that this is based on a very interesting event that took place with a lot of eye opening results and discoveries I suppose and just look at it as a way to expose your insecurities as someone who believes that these movies are trying to make YOU feel guilty for something you had nothing to do with.

He played such a lovable, endearing, creepy weirdo&&They even have a documentary about him on HBO right now that's pretty good called ""Barry"".&&It's also because, by Adam Driver's own admission, he actively seeks out ""famous"" or iconic directors to work with, even if it involves taking on roles in seemingly ""doomed"" or ""cursed"" projects of theirs (i.e. *Silence*, *The Man Who Killed Don Quixote*). He's got a ""director bucket list"" of-sorts.

In turn, Driver's willingness to assist with and star in said ""cursed"" projects, simply for the desire to work with certain figures, and him being very genuine and charming about his love for the craft, tends to endear him quite a lot to these directors. He just...*really* loves acting. (As an edit, he also cares a lot more about helping these directors get their projects made, as opposed to making money.)

At Cannes, Driver said the following to an interviewer:

>  “I’ve grown up watching their movies,” he said about all...[iconic] directors [he's worked with]. “I just love their movies. I want to work with filmmakers I’ve always admired. I could want to do that a lot and not get the opportunity, so I’ve been lucky that timing or whatever has worked out.” [(Source)](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/adam-driver-interview-blackkklansman-star-wars-1201965211/)&&He has that face that isn't weird, beautiful, ugly, and has that cool voice. 

He's a good actor by talent alone, but his physical feature is what a lot of directors would call perfect.&&It's amazing how many great directors he's had the chance to work with and learn from.

Golly gee wiz, folks, I just can’t seem to figure out why Jordan Peele is so interested in black culture! No correlation here! Nope. Nuh-uh.

Seriously though. The man makes a good movie touching upon black culture and that makes him “obsessed”?&&Not necessarily. If he did what a movie producer is ""supposed"" to do then he was the head of anything practical and worked really closely with the director to help him fulfill his vision in a practical sense.

Usually, ""executive producers"" are the ones who give money and in return get their name on the title. Could be different on this one of course&&He was involved well before Spike Lee. At one point before Get Out he was considering directing as well. Far as I’ve heard from people involved, he had a good bit of input on the front end.&&Typically producers, if they have worked in the industry in the past and aren’t just finding a film, actually do quite a bit of work in terms of practical budget/delegation. A lot of times the Producer and Production Manager work very closely together in making sure that everything from equipment to parking is carefully figured out. The amount of things that can go wrong on a movie set is tremendous and a producer is pretty instrumental in making sure almost every possible scenario is planned for.  &&He may have arranged some things behind the scenes as well. The role of a producer can be a bit unclear to us outsiders.

But still you are right and i don't think it really matters. Spike Lee is the name people should be focussing on here. (Although Jordan Peele certainly doesn't hurt.)&&That's pretty blunt if you ask me.&&Anything new would be welcomed, because this is gonna be a long couple of months if every thread will basically be filled with the same joke, told extremely poorly... because people aren't even trying to be clever or subtle about it. &&Inside Man was fantastic!

People in the military can't be racists?&&To people so engrossed in the predominantly white media culture, having black culture presented more than once is suddenly seen as ""obsession"" because it stands out so much in their minds and they generally aren't super happy about something ""not being for them."" Which is stupid because black people often have little choice but to consume white media. Generally they don't mind, black people seem to enjoy white media as much as the rest of us. But for some reason black media is seen as ""not for white people"" by white people. This stands out in white people's minds because for the most part America caters to them. Just look at how many white people are outraged that they can't use the N word.  Many are obsessed with the fact that they can't use that one word. They're so used to being able to do anything they want that this one tiny word they can't have drives them crazy. It all really comes down to entitlement. A fantastic black director makes two films centering around black culture and race issues and he is labelled obsessed by white people who feel entitled to get a movie out of him that is ""for them.""&&As meaningless as executive producer Ashton Kutcher&&Yeah, this was initially shopped as *Jordan Peele's Black Klansman*.

Plus he had smaller parts in a Clint Eastwood movie (J. Edgar) and a Spielberg movie (Lincoln).&&> “Wow, where has he been hiding this whole time?!”

There's also several other factors at-play, and having been involved in the industry myself, I'll bring up the main one.

Adam Driver didn't get into formally acting until around age 24, when he was accepted into Julliard, as opposed to other actors who are schooled / trained from much earlier ages. He was recently quoted as saying something along the lines of, ""10 years ago, in 2008, I wasn't even in the industry, or acting"". 

In my experience, those who want to get into the industry usually are trained in acting much earlier, especially if you're British. For example, you'll notice that many British actors come from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), or another arts school. The United States has only recently started forming more arts-centric schools (i.e. high schools) in certain areas. 

There's a decidedly American push-back, or looking down on, an education in acting / the arts (i.e. [anti-intellectualism](https://www.thedailybeast.com/richard-hofstadter-and-americas-new-wave-of-anti-intellectualism)), especially in relation to [American championing of sports](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CASMAI_enUS772US773&ei=Gtn9WuL2PJLtzgLsgIGACw&q=arts+vs+sports+in+schools&oq=arts+vs+sports+&gs_l=psy-ab.1.1.0j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1l7.284835.289497.0.291711.20.18.2.0.0.0.363.2500.0j10j2j2.15.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.17.2663.6..38j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131i67k1j0i131k1j0i20i264k1j0i20i263i264k1j0i10k1j0i22i10i30k1.146.fck-KSDHZjA) (i.e. arts = seen as ""feminine"", sports = seen as ""masculine""). So much so, that [the Trump administration is slashing funding for many federally-funded arts education programs](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-students-struggling-arts-and-donald-trump_us_58ff678be4b0c46f0782711b), with the excuse that ""[arts is not a worthwhile or] proper function"". 

Even before then, [in 2014](https://sites.psu.edu/richmondcivicissue/2014/03/26/why-schools-are-cutting-fine-arts-education/) and [in 1993](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/03/us/as-schools-trim-budgets-the-arts-lose-their-place.html), it was reported that school budget-trimming across the country often caused arts education to be the first to be cut, usually in favor of increasing ""more money-making / profitable"" sports funding. 

Spike Lee, the director of *BlackKklansman*, also said as much:

> “I think we have a little crisis going on amongst our young actors at this point,” and Spike Lee, commenting on the “invasion” of black British actors, had some pithy observations on the subject, too: “You want talented people,” he said, and British actors’ “training is very proper, whereas some of these other [American] brothers and sisters, you know, they come in here, and they don’t got that training.” [(Source)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/decline-american-actor/395291/)

Because Adam Driver didn't have ""classical training"", and got into acting later than many others around his age in the industry, most directors probably tended to overlook him at first due to that.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SNMr9EmO4Y

All I could think of&&He's definitely unique and that counts more than anything in film. There are a million generic looking dudes out there, standing out from the crowd is what gets you noticed.

Some people find him really attractive and some don't at all. He isn't ""traditionally handsome"" which makes some people more attracted to him, since he looks more like a normal guy you might know.

He definitely has ginormous ears either way and grew his hair out to cover them up a bit/completely.&&He’s also like a 6’3” former marine who then got a gut for *Girls* before becoming Ben swolo. His career shows uniqueness and hard work if nothing else&&The French call it Jolie Laide- ugly pretty &&Didn't think you were poking fun.

Because as perfect as Malek looks for the role, that's what I've heard about this project's development over the past few years.&&Well apparently the original writers left the project because the remaining members of Queen, Brian May most vocally, wouldn't let them do anything which could put any of them into a bad light, even though it was all true.

So this is going to be by the numbers and with all the Juicy bits cut away to leave an unfulfilling experience.&&Wasn’t Sacha Baron Cohen originally Freddie but left when the producers wanted to push the best parts of Freddie rather than the truth and the band also only wants to look good rather than staying true to who Freddie really was? &&considering a huge chunk of the movie is post Freddie mercury and makes brian may out to be the driving force behind queen, its no wonder why Sasha baron cohen walked out of the project.

They weren’t the Beatles; there’s a distinct difference between the group collective vs. front man dynamo types of bands.  Their refusal to recognize that seems to have doomed this project.  Step aside, he IS the story.  The man was arguably one of the top three performers of all time.   

(MJ, Freddie, and James Brown imo)&&Jesus what a terrible poster&&Still think sascha baron cohen would have been a better freddie mecury&&Heard bad things about this movie. Heard Sacha Baron Cohen dropped out of the lead role as Mercury because they only wanted to make the first half of the film with him in it and then kill him off.

It is a crying shame the members of Queen were so uptight and wanted a watered down version that doesn't fully represent the eccentric life style of Freddie Mercury and thus they let Baron Cohen go.  &&Right, so everytime something comes out about this film, whether it's pictures or news tidbits, the majority of the comments on this subreddit always lament the fact that it doesn't star Sacha Baron Cohen/isn't the project he initially wanted to do.

Now honestly, I'd rather have SBC as Freddie and his description of the project he left sounds like shit- but who's to say that this film, 'Bohemian Rhapsody', is the exact project he left? It's highly likely the script has gone through many changes over the past like 5 years. Looking at this film, it seems to be chronicling Queen from their inception up until Live Aid '85, which obviously can't have Freddie dying halfway through. Again, I'd have preferred SBC, but I think people are getting a lil too het up about something that may not be the case at all. &&Looks like a Bollywood movie.&&It's gonna suck. &&Sacha Baron Cohen would have done a much better job, but they wouldn't let him do more of the personal stories about Freddie Mercury.

In reality you will only get a job in this business if you were able to prove yourself and work your ass of basically for free for years until you get noticed by the right people. Other than that you get paid barely more than being a cashier.

I consider myself actually knowledgeable about graphic design, I use photoshop for over 15 years now, have an eye for colors, compositions and general design aspects and I‘d say I produce pretty high quality stuff, but since I‘m not willed to work for barely more than minimum wage I‘m out of luck.

I‘m sorry this turned into a mini rant. I love creating stuff, but I‘m sour I basically wasted 3 years of my life with a degree that I could’ve thrown into the bin the second I got it.&&
>Source: was a graphic designer (top of class with a 4.0), now I'm poor as fuck

Having a 4.0 as a graphic designer means dick. That's your first mistake. 

If you don't have an amazing portfolio, you won't get a job. That simple. 

No one cares about your GPA
&&Every field is like that. Unless you have a top-tier reputation at what you do, which is literally the 1%, who you know will always get you further than what you know.&&Surprised you're the only one to mention it.

This whole thread is full of discussion about Freddie Mercury, and Graphic Design... and nobody is putting the two together!

https://i.imgur.com/7zd7EpP.jpg&&Or this was option c in a deck and the client picked it. Which is most likely. &&I don't think this is true in such a negative sense, it's more that you need ""soft"" skills as well as design skills unless you're an exceptional talent. I've worked in many studios and I see talented designers get turned away a lot because they're terrible to work with or don't grasp the business as well as the design. There's a place for those that can execute great design and nothing else but for 99% of us you've gotta be able to communicate well and work with others well, which includes networking unfortunately.&&I found RT's consensus writer.&&No that's exactly what is happening here. That's why we're not getting the Sacha baron Cohen movie. He wants to make a true to life movie about Freddie, but to use any thing about queen you have to get Brian Mays permission. 

Brian and the band heard what sachas plan was and they said no because they wanted it to be a happy story and to paint the rest of the band members in a better light.

Brian may is a great guitarist, but I'll never forgive the cunt for not letting the original planned movie happen. I'm starting to think they only thing he liked about Freddie was the fact that he was making him money by being in the same band and even after Freddie's death he is still riding on his coat tails and making money off him. &&Agreed.

The people who were good charged $120 to $150 per hour, but damn were they good.  Sometimes I would talk with someone for a couple hours and they would come back the next day with dozens of thumbnails that would just blow me away.  It’s like they could see the images in your mind and transfer them to paper.

Sometimes, we would have several designers work on the start of a job, then I had the horrible task of throwing away a lot of outstanding work because something else was a little more outstanding.   Graphics people rock.&&This is really good for me to read.

I have a different career path, but make fan poster art as a pass time. My most recent work has been spreading around to the point where I’m introduced to people as, “Logic? He does AMAZING Star Wars posters!” I’ve made 4 so far in the past 2 years. 

So my confidence bolstered, I keep sending them to Acme Archives Direct hoping that they’d notice or care. They don’t. No email back, no nothing. It really has taken the wind out of my sails that the last 3 posters I’ve done have been met with silence. The first one they did respond, saying “try this different approach,” which I did in poster 2.  Nothing. Poster 3: nothing. [Poster 4, my best-yet:](https://i.redd.it/gxe3mtfe6ym01.png) nothing. 

It really hurts that something I spent so many hours creating isn’t “making it.”  It may seem stupid to think that my around-the-workplace admiration isn’t enough, but I just assume people are being polite now and it’s really not that good. 

But vent-session over, it is a relief to see that people choosing this as a career (versus my hobby) are having a hard time. Sorry for your struggles and thanks for reading. &&yeah this was also my first thought...almost every successful designer i know (and certainly all my design idols) are mostly self-taught. no one gives a shit what your GPA is or what school you went to if your portfolio is trash. &&This was the one intended to make options A and B look better so they would just pick one instead of asking for more options.&&They wouldn't say 'on point'.&&Sacha Baron Cohen said he understands the remaining members of Queen want to preserve their legacy and don't want the excesses of their past to be brought up.

Wait just a sec, there...

I grew up listening to Queen. No one can deny Freddy's charisma and performing ability pretty much makes him the greatest rock god ever in the history of rock gods.

But...

From everything I've read, seen and heard about the band, they were a surprisingly close bunch. Additionally, you can't take away the fact that ALL of them wrote and contributed musically to making the songs we've come to love.&&Brian May makes money because he is Brian May. He's a rock god himself, and has a PHD in Astrophysics. Don't get it twisted. There's a reason the band isn't called ""Freddie Mercury and Queen."" Brian wrote many of Queen's best songs and often rivals Freddie in that regard. 

I mean come on:

*Who Wants To Live Forever*

*The Show Must Go On*

*We Will Rock You*

*Fat Bottomed Girls*

*The Prophet's Song*

*Brighton Rock*

*'39* 

He did pretty good. 
He was very close to Freddie. His death, along with that of his father and divorce, almost lead the man to suicide in the 90s. 


I NEED this movie to be good. 
But goddamn it, I don't know, man.  
I've been nervous ever since Sasha bounced and the news that Bryan fucking Singer was chosen as director the first time around.
Regardless, we still got the music. &&I agree with most of it, but I feel it’s just not true to depict May as purely a byproduct of Freddie, Brian is a great songwriter as well as guitarist, he didn’t need Freddie to make it big and Queen would not be as big as it is without Brian. Queen was, more than most bands, a group of equally talented writers and musicians. It’s wrong to attribute everything to Freddie just because he was the face everyone knows.&&That’s deeply unfair to Brian in all honesty. He was a massive part of Queen’s success, and you only need to watch interviews where he discusses Freddie’s death to see how much he meant to him.&&Stop the circlejerk. Maybe Freddie dying at the halfway point was the plan at one point but it's changed since then (the new synopsis on IMDB reads: ""A chronicle of the years leading up to Queen's legendary appearance at the Live Aid (1985) concert in 1985."") Brian May also disputed Sacha Baron Cohen's version of the facts, so it's not clearcut who is telling the truth, but people prefer to shit on May anyway. &&They could’ve had the tag line be any Queen lyric that everyone knows. Hell, make it a song name like “Show Must Go On.” 

Lazy as hell. &&My hopes died when Sacha Baren Cohen left the project&&It's gonna need a really good trailer.&&Bad poster. Bad job. Bad you.&&The prouduction sounds like a dumpster fire. This poster looks like they're just rolling with it. &&A rated-R Sacha Baron Cohen Queen biopic is all I want in my life.&&It better not be the same bullshit SBC said it was when he was involved. &&Yea my joke is the reflection in his glasses is supposed to like, be Queen but it just says Que&&[You might be right, damn close though.](https://imgur.com/a/DB4mDYv)&&Maybe it's supposed to be printed on the lens?&&Well, yes, but that would be confusing too.

sasha would've been perfect, but let's not disrespect Mr. Robot.&&Yes, thank you.

I always thought Sacha looked just like Freddie. And then when he announced the biopic it was perfect.

I mean not only does he look just like him, Sacha also has the chops to play his wild lifestyle.


Just, idk, fuck man. If this guy plays Freddie that means Sacha won't ever attempt it. &&I had to scroll down way too far to come across Sacha Baron Cohen. I'm disappointed in you Reddit. Didn't we make it ABSOLUTELY clear that Cohen's name must be on the top of the comments each time this movie comes up?&&Replace 'is on point' with 'gives a mesmerizing performance' and we're good to go.&&I don't disagree with him. I just rather see a truthful documentary and not something the remaining members wanna convert as the truth. &&Thank you. Brian and Roger's biggest crime is that maybe they don't want the excesses and indulgences of their past to be on parade and quite possibly the main thing they're remembered for (the movie will be the defining measure for a lot of audience members). Let's keep in mind that Freddie was a private guy in life, and the rest of the band have a right to protect their legacy as best they can.&&They basically co-founded the band then played together for 20 fucking years. I'll trust Brian over anyone elses opinion because you don't work with someone that close for 20 years without at least respecting each other.&&I think there's a stark difference between Brian's opinion of Freddie and himself in interviews before Freddie died and those after. But you're also comparing interviews with a 20-30 year old guitar rock star and a 50-70 year old man.&&Even ""Don't Stop Me Now"", ""I Want It All"", ""Who Wants To Live Forever"", and ""Stone Cold Crazy"" are song names that could've worked as a tag line. 

Lazy poster overall.&&Probably don't call it Another One Bites the Dust. Cause spoilers.&&I wouldn't even call it lazy. The lazy option would have been to do what you just said, and it would've worked much better and made sense.

They did work when they shouldn't have. This is impressively terrible.&&He was so on the money with what he said - I hope the band listened to his criticism, which was basically that there is no film after Freddie dies. &&> My ~~hopes~~ heart died when Sacha Baren Cohen left the project

&&Agreed. With that said - Rami Malek is not a bad choice for the lead imho. He could very well project that particular Freddie aura. We’ll see.&&Have it chronicle Mercury's life from Queen's formation to the end. Near the middle, have him get AIDS, then have him wasting away slowly through the rest of the film. One of the final scenes could be the recording of The Show Must Go On. While we see his glorious one-take, splice it with footage of him on his deathbed, then show his funeral and cremation. On Freddie's final belt of ""SHOOOOOOOW!!!!"", have the flames engulf his casket. The end credits can be a montage of Queen shows while Save Me plays. There, I just wrote a better movie than Queen approves of. It's a little cliche and Oscar baity, but it's better than ""Kill Freddie halfway through, then show what Queen's been up to without him"".&&I know :(

It sucks.

What makes it suck more is that now Sacha won't ever attempt a Freddie biopic.

I would rather have no movie if it meant a chance with Sacha later. &&It will be.

It's bout queen going on after his death.  &&Sacha said he did years of research and wanted to show the rock star excesses, but the band said no.&&If the rumors regarding why Sacha Baron Cohen was removed the surviving Queen members wanted the pic to be a very watered down version of Mercurys life with a focus on Queen after his death. Mostly trying to paint Freddie as some sort of tragic, gone too soon, talent rather than the raunchy, drug and sex fuled performer that he was and ultimatly lead to his untimely death.

There are better biopics out there regarding his life than what this one has been continually painted as.&&There was a video that’s been deleted of the set of him at liveaid and It’s uncanny.

He never got it fixed because he was afraid it would affect his voice.&&Because Cohen left when the band put their foot down and demanded the movie be about how they carried on after Freddie's death. So he'll die halfway through&&There are some problems actors can't fix. However, they are free to dip the fuck out when they see the writing on the walls and the actor who fills their shoes should have their eyes wide open but it's generally that they are either too oblivious to see it as well, or too hungry for the work that they convince themselves. Even great actors take bad projects.&&He's a great actor. I don't buy him as Freddie Mercury for a second.&&I question if the film will be entertaining at all if what Queen told Sacha is true. It sounds like we should get ready to leave the theater early.&&I totally agree with you.  It's really a disservice to humanity to not explain how someone like him got so famous.  Like what events transformed him into a superstar?  How much luck was really involved? Or was he a furious showboater since high school?&&Brian was the original member of the band we know as Queen today. He went off in search of a drummer and got Roger Taylor. Freddie joined later after their original lead singer for their band, Smile, quit. 

It is quite annoying when people completely neglect the other members of Queen. I get that Freddie was basically the heart of the band, but  all 4 members made it [as lame as this sounds] a high functioning body. &&Tell that to Pink Floyd. Last i heard Waters and Gilmore still couldn’t stand each other. Even so they still worked together. &&id have loved to see the title, Radio Ga-Ga&&If the tagline had been ""Fat-Bottomed Girls"", it'd have my attention.&&“Don’t Stop Me Now” and “Who Wants To Live Forever” would have been A+ titles.&&Or even ""Shilouetto of a Man""&&> They did work when they shouldn't have. 

I find this even more offensive. They probably worked hard to give us mediocrity. If it is going to be mediocre at least have the human decency to put no effort into it.&&Yes, thank you.

I always thought Sacha looked just like Freddie. And then when he announced the biopic it was perfect.

I mean not only does he look just like him, Sacha also has the acting chops to play his wild lifestyle.


Just, idk, fuck man. If this guy plays Freddie that means Sacha won't ever attempt it. &&Doesnt matter how good the replacement is, if Sacha Baron-Cohen felt that he was better off not being involved, I trust his judgement.&&The problem isn’t that Sacha left, it’s the reasoning behind him leaving &&You just made a better movie and you didn't even have to write the screenplay, flesh out the plot, make realistic dialogue, cast solid actors, go through the wardrobe and set designs, find locations, actually shoot and edit and promote the thing. It didn't cost you anything and could hardly have taken much time. The only drawback is I have to close my eyes and imagine it&&As designer, thats the first thing I noticed on the whole poster and it really throws it off. My first thought was ""might be part of the glasses,"" my second thought was ""definitely looks bad anyway.""&&Sammy Saturn&&Ah, much like Jackie Jormp-Jomp. The Janis Joplin biopic with no music or life rights starring Jenna Maroney. &&The biggest stumbling block would be music rights. You could write a story that's fine enough to use without anyone's permission while still essentially being a Freddie Mercury biopic, but you're left without the music, and without the music you lose a lot of the soul (for lack of a better word) of the story.

I'm sure he could still do it, but I can see why he might not think it's a worthwhile endeavor to even try to pursue/put together.&&**LIVES**&&[deleted]&&""Don't....do it""&&That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.&&Which sounds super boring. &&That was the original plan that made Sacha leave the film. It's ending with Live Aid in 1985 now.&&[deleted]&&The film finishes at the Live Aid concert, years before Mercury's death. You can check the synopsis at imdb. What Cohen claimed was according to Brian May was a lie.&&Damn, at least Rami will deliver a good performance regardless of how the rest of the movie turns out.&&damn why isn't anyone talking about this? made me feel a lot better&&Dicky doesn't move that much.

I was just surprised that they literally added fake teeth... in the pic it looks absurd.&&It's not just that, it's also because Sacha Baron Cohen envisioned a gritty, realistic and flawed portrayal (the drugs, crazy sex parties etc.) whereas the remaining Queen band members wanted a sanitised, family-friendly account of Queen's history. To be honest Sacha Baron Cohen's vision of the film sounded much more interesting than the squeaky-clean propaganda it looks like the film will probably end up to be.&&Yep. I wouldn't mind seeing a little bit of what happened after Freddie died, the big tribute concert and how the band tried to move on. That should take no more than 15 minutes tops though. &&Couple this with the rumors that the movie will follow the surviving members after the death of Freddie *and* that it will not go into detail of the cause of his death, this movie has looked like a stinker before Malik was ever attached.  &&well said. &&Bone structure wise, I think he's a perfect fit. Though I do wonder if he can pull of everything else. &&He looks just like him everywhere but his eyes. They don't seem to have given him brown contacts to match Mercury for some reason...&&They can make him look taller, and his face is more spot on than anyone else I can imagine. My concern is his ability to express confidence and swagger. Just going off of mr Robot that's a hell no... but hes an actor and that's probably just acting. &&Farrokh Bulsara is of middle eastern descent (ethnic Parsi, born India).  This may have factored into choosing Malek&&That’s the movie they wanted Sacha to make. I believe THIS version doesn’t even touch Freddie’s death, it leads right up to their LiveAid concert or something.&&That's true, all 4 members each wrote a number 1 hit song. I think the only band to ever do that.&&Agreed, in any other band Brian May could easily have been the front man, he just happened to find a lead singer with perhaps the most powerful set of vocal chords the human race has ever seen.&&To be fair, the current title is pretty good. It's just that everything else they've released has been really weak.&&Title: Radio Ga-Ga

Tagline: Tear It Up. &&They make the rockin world go round.&&Id have bought tickets right now if that was the case&&I always thought ""Don't Stop Me Now"" should've been the name of the movie.

How would they match the look without prosthetics? It's not like the picture is from a trailer - it will look different on camera.&&this, David Fincher's Steve Jobs movie and Edgar Wright's Ant Man keep me up at night knowing we'll never ever get them&&I'm struggling to think of what the movie would actually even be about if Freddie dies halfway through. Honestly, whats left? The story of Deacon going off to live like a hermit? The other two acting like a cover band?

I mean, its not like AC/DC who after the death of Bon Scott actually went on to create a hell of a lot of memorable top ten hits. Queen did basically nothing except release a tribute song to Freddie (that nobody would even remember) and Brian playing guitar for ~~5 minutes~~ 1:45 on top of a building.
&&I think the comparison is done by now, so you've probably already heard all this, but comparing him to [Sacha Baron Cohen](http://digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/16/10/980x490/landscape-1457534752-movies-freddie-mercury-sacha-baron-cohen.jpg) is the obvious one, for obvious reasons. Beyond looking nearly identical to him, I think he has that exact same larger than life ""presence"". Life's a stage for the both of them. There's obviously also the fact that I know he could play a gay guy, or a foreigner really well.

I think showing what he does well is showing me what I don't get from Rami.&&Also, his eyes dont look like any other human's eyes.&&He's in night at the museum. Not the greatest of movies, I know, but he does act completely different than in Mr. Robot&&Parsi mtDNA is mostly South Asian, indicating origination from a mostly male population migrating to India and taking local wives.&&This goes past the concert and past Freddie being diagnosed and ends with him accepting her probably die as he stands up to his homophobic parents &&Plus it is their most well known song other than We Will Rock You and We are Champions, actually any of those three would be good titles.&&Why are we going with alliterations? Freddy mercury isn't an alliteration&&Joking aside, the new singer they've got is incredible, and way more suited to it than Paul Rodgers. I saw Queen + Paul Rodgers at a huge packed out stadium and the most interesting thing was Roger Taylor did a drum solo by walking into this extension of the stage that extended unto the crowd, sat on a chair, and piece by piece the crew built a drum set around him while he was playing. But anyway, been trying to get tickets to see Queen with the new singer guy and every arena/stadium sells out in minutes, and I refuse to pay scalpers £200 for tickets. It's a shame, as again he's way better at the Freddie Mercury style than Rodgers (though Rodgers is a great singer for his style). Well I saw them before at least plus Brian May was the chancellor of my university so on graduation day I got to take a photo with him, so I'm pretty satisfied&&If you think that Wembley 1986 is their best show, then you are missing out on a LOT of amazing shows which are many times better than Wembley 1986. To start, Freddie isn't in that great of shape (vocally) during the second Wembley show (the more famous one) and it's one of his worst concerts on the tour. If you want Freddie during his peak, check out concerts from December 1979 - June 1982. While the band is ok in general, there isn't much experimentation on stage during the 1986 tour. If you want to see the top tier musicianship that they brought to the table, then check out the Jazz tour (October 1978 - May 1979) Brighton Rock/instrumentals. For a good balance of both, Stockholm 1978 and Copenhagen 1978 are go-to shows.&&I mean Fincher doesn't write does he? It was still Sorkin's screenplay. Anyway I love that movie to bits, Fassbender is tremendous.&&I don’t understand where the narrative is coming from about him dying half way through? Or did they announce this? Cause they could easily kill him at the end of act 2 and have act 3 be the mourning. That’s how I’d do it at least, maybe even have him die at the beginning of act 3.&&>	The other two acting like a cover band?

Seriously. Did they even release any new single since 1991? 

I feel that not only they lost Freddie’s voice and charisma, they also lost John’s songwriting skills. &&He can also sing beautifully &&I don't see that kinda charisma coming outta Rami.&&> or a foreigner

like, a British guy?
&&It's criminal how much Sacha looks like him, what a missed opportunity.&&Plot twist; 2 days before movie releases the Freddie Mercury estate releases an unknown single from Queen titled, ""Fearless Lives Forever""&&It's just funnier that way.&&This guy Queens&&Fassbender, Boyle and Sorkin did a great job, but it would have been cool to have The Social Network dynamic again.&&https://youtu.be/xq-M4JA3fIU&&I don't have a reason for or against thinking Rami could pull it off. He could be totally surprising like Heath Ledger's Joker, but I just don't think there's as much room. He's imitating a real person. You can't just be a good actor, I think you really have to be spot-on. Having the same natural personality is 90% of it.&&I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt until we actually see him shit the bed&&Yeah, what the hell is he talking about there?&&I'd listen to audio of Freddie singing while taking a shit with real loud farts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_and_Jennifer_Gibbons&&I dare you to not watch any previews and go in totally blind&&This is the first thing I've seen about Jordan Peele's second movie. Count me in, I was blown away by Get Out. That movie earned him so much respect from me as a writer/director. I knew he could do comedy at a high level but damn, I was super impressed. &&""Academy Award Winner Jordan Peele"" has a nice ring to it.

Also, in theaters March of next year? I feel like that's a real quick turnaround. Just looked it up, it's almost two years exactly from the release of Get Out. Incredibly impressive he was able to complete a script, secure funding, and accomplish all the other pre-production necessary while participating in that gauntlet of a press junket he did for Get Out.&&With Lupita, Winston Duke, and Elizabeth Moss eyed to star....&&""Hi, how can I help you today?""

""Sure, for which movie?""

$5M budget, $225M gross. 4 Oscar nominations for a horror movie released in February, which in itself is completely mindblowing and unheard of. 99% on Rotten Tomatoes & 84 on Metacritic. He instantly became the hottest director in Hollywood overnight. Pretty much launched the big-screen careers of Lakeith Stanfield, Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, and Lil Rel Howery.

Needless to say, I'm excited for this.&&I love everything about Jordan Peele’s marketing strategy. His movies harken back to the golden age of hollywood when people didn’t know what they were getting into upon entering the theatre.

So happy i fell ass backwards into the most impactful film experience&&I try to do that with all my movies now&&That’s the best way to watch horror movies.&&All the advertising I saw for Get Out was enough to draw in without spoiling any of the 10 plot twists. I love going in blind, but I also have complete faith that the trailer will be 1 percent of the movie, just like they should be and often aren’t. &&Tbh I go in totally blind for most films, it's a lot more enjoyable that way imo, especially if it's something I was going to watch  anyway. E.g. Infinity war&&*Get Out* earned him a 'do anything you want' card for the next decade at least.

Well deserved.&&It's similar to John Krasinki and A Quiet Place&&Does Keanu count as his first movie or do we ignore that one? &&They do say writing comedy and making people laugh in general is one of the most difficult tasks for a writer/actor to do in the entertainment industry. I've heard so many actors say acting in a comedy is the most difficult type of acting they have done in their whole career. Basically, if you can write a good comedy, you are very likely to be able to turn your hand to writing other film genres and do a good job of it. &&None of the deal are closed, probably isn’t finished writing it yet, I think it’s funny they released the poster so early, seems a bit premature to me. Not that the project isn’t going to happen, I’m very excited for his next movie, but I mean c’mon. Nearly a year away and this movie could still be about anything. I mean I’m going to see it even if this poster doesn’t tell us anything &&Plus, he's got a bunch of side projects like producing Black Klansman, a TV show, and taking on some voice roles. Impressive as shit.
&&I vaguely remember hearing he has/had 3 films completely written including get out. I wouldn't be surprised if another one is out by 2021&&I imagine getting funding wasn't too difficult with massive success Get Out has had&&>""Academy Award Winner Jordan Peele"" has a nice ring to it.

I feel like all the K&P sketches online should be updated to say this, for heightened absurdity. Especially the Meegan sketches. *Especially*.

&&I mean outside of visual effects spectaculars, small movies like horror thrillers usually only take about a month to film and because they don’t need to wait a year for post production the final film could be in the can and ready for festival previews later *this* year.&&Honestly 2 years is not a quick turn around at all.   Release of a movie is often wellllll past its final take.  The writing for a movie was often done way before funding, often years before.  Funding would be easy after his last film, which if I’m not mistaken, was the biggest return in Hollywood last year? Also these types of movies are usually simpler to film and are often filmed in a single month. 3 at the most and after that scheduling conflicts can kill the film.&&A writer wouldn’t have only 1 completed script. He probably has at least 3-5 completed ones at this moment and a dozen or so ideas/treatments for others. &&>""Academy Award Winner Jordan Peele"" has a nice ring to it.

Honestly still getting used to it.

Every time I watch the ""terries"" sketch from Key and Peele I just turn to my friend and go ""Oscar winner right there""&&WE HAVE WATCHED...AND LISTENED...FROM THE MOUNTAINS...FOR ANY NEWS ON THIS NEW JORDAN PEELE MOVIE.&&Damn, stellar lineup if that's true. 

Moss & Lupita can act their asses off and Duke was great in BP. &&Yeah this is a FANTASTIC cast.  I don't know how Moss finds the time to shoot all of this stuff.  And Im glad to see Lupita getting more roles; its seems like BP did more than her career than winning an oscar did lol.&&I just binged the first season of The Handmaid’s Tale and now anything she’s gonna be in I’m excited. Especially if she brings that level of performance. &&I immediately thought the silhouette on the poster looked like Letitia Wright&&Similar thing happened last September

“See what?”&&""Sir I'm going to have to ask you to get out""

But, yes, it's still pretty surreal.&&But no one sees the middle finger in the inkblot?&&And it's a sequel to *Up*.&&That’s exactly what I thought when I saw the poster. The artwork is extremely similar &&Now there's an idea for a Netflix series... &&It's the perfect teaser poster. Gives nothing away but completely grabs your attention.&&I'm a huge horror fan and I never would've guessed the hilarious dude from ""Key & Peele"" would help to reinvigorate Hollywood's love for horror. But here we are. And I'm not complaining. &&Lakeith was amazing in Short Term 12. Williams was a star on an HBO show and lil rel was a main character on network tv. It's not like he got nobodies &&it was 5Mil to make?? wow. it cost less than Mallrats lol&&Kubrick was the master of that. I love all his trailers.&&It looks like it. The right person looks like Lupita Nyong'o to me&&""He made a movie about a particular cult of white people who fetishized black people and as such ALL white people are now evil!  Please don't tell his white wife or white mother""&&The movie even portrays the white male police officer who stops our black protagonist in a neutral tone, and it becomes clear on rewatching it that he was a sympathetic character.

I could easily make the case that this movie is reactionary as fuck.&&It'd make sense with the title too. &&EXACTLY I never got that vibe. Im white but I got a decent amount of latino and native in me, I hate when people make all white people out to be evil or all men to be evil but I really never got that from this movie. I said it in a previous comment but the ghost busters remake pissed me off making men and whites evil and really shoving it in your face.&&It would mean a few good movies before a bunch of shitty ones.&&Be thankful you have to sort by controversial to unearth them.&&> Sorting **any** threads by controversial always make me reconsider why I'm on this site&&beauty and thuuuh beeeeeeeeast&&Good point, but he said he had four scripts fully written.

If that's what you took away from Get Out, then you get offended *really* easily.&&SUPER BRAVE. &&Is it really? i am not American so I don't get what was really anti white, it felt like a simple thriller.

Maybe because of cultural difference I don't get it, by why does many people think Get Out is anti white?&&I think we can expect a good bit more of that from this guy. &&>puts sucdem bernie on screen for one second

There, I made the most communist movie in US history&&Serious question: what's wrong with that? I personally don't mind seeing movies about this subject so I'm wondering what bothers you about it. &&If it is, look forward to tons of articles from Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, Vox, etc. praising its deep and insightful commentary

The phrase ""this is the film we need right now"" will also be used&&Yeah, I thought it was good, but not this transcendental masterpiece like it was made out to be.&&I think he’s aiming less pure horror and more Twilight Zone/Black Mirror. Allows for the nightmares, but also allows for absurdity and humour and even real moments of tenderness as well.&&It was a located in the US, therefore a Western. &&It was a romantic comedy.

&&But it was anti-black racism that traumatized them as children living in Wales.

I guarantee it will have nothing to do with it.&&I went in blind thinking it was a comedy and took my sister-in-law who hates horrors -_-&&Same, I knew nothing about it besides the fact people were saying it was good. Very pleasantly surprised.&&My friend went in blind to Get Out as well. Previews for other movies started playing and she turned to me and goes “are we watching a horror film?” Lol no one apparently told her &&I did as well. My brothers saw it and recommended it and I was looking for a movie. So I just went in randomly and watched only thinking that it might have some social commentary. Great experience. &&A friend asked me to go see Ready Player One with him. And I had only heard of the name and that it's about video games. I saw no previews or read anyone's thoughts on it. I didn't even see any posters. It felt so nice going in with no expectations at all. I'm doing that with everything as well. I'll keep up with production but I wont be checking out anything else related to this movie. :)&&best way to watch any movie&&I'll usually watch the first teaser and call it off after that. I go as far as to cover my eyes and ears. I'm probably going to stop watching teasers though because even those are too revealing sometimes.&&Unless his next movie is trash, then it’d be revoked quite quickly &&Can someone explain what was so amazing about Get Out? I'm not hating, it's a fairly well written, very well shot movie, but I don't understand why it's so highly touted. Again, I'm not hating, I just never got what was so amazing about it.

Keanu was fucking hilarious.&&Also working on Lovecraft Country for HBO.&&I read that he plans on making 7-8 films all about different aspects of our society, our social commentary and how screwed up it all is...

Must say he's off to a great start..

And yes it also mentioned that he had more than a few of them already down on paper so..   
I expect good things to come from him&&$225M return on a $5M budget will definitely open a bunch of doors.&&When John Krasinski was doing his promo tours for A Quiet Place he was saying how the movie was still being edited.  It was put together so quickly that it could theoretically draw inspiration from Get Out.&&I'd bet great actors/actresses are lining up to be in this project.

Studio: yeah mmmkay great. Well just make sure it's relatable even vaguely to this post we are going to release and have it done before the date and we will give you all the money you want. &&Jordan Peele and John Krasinski are the two hottest directors of horror right now. Think about that. &&Yeah, that's the best part about it, it just totally came out of nowhere.&&I think the reason someone who is good at comedy can be good at horror too is bc both genres rely on timing and buildup to be good. And also, bad horror can easily become funny, so someone who can recognize humor would be able to avoid the pitfalls of bad horror by recognizing the comedy in the situation ahead of time. &&He was amazing in Short Term 12. Mind-blowing performance. Definitely stuck with me for a long time. &&The Lolita campaign was interesting.  &&Two great actors if Lakeith stanfield is starring im all in &&How are you able to distinguish that lol&&Not to mention the villains in Get Out were rich, liberal, Obama supporters. &&And then a good movie years later to bring it back around. I am one of the few people who didn’t lose faith in M. Night. I think he was expected to churn out non stop hits, but he really worked best when just working on smaller budget passion projects, not being put under the pressure of expecting huge returns on a bigger budget movie he was being pushed to make. They threw him a little bit of money, let him make split and didn’t bother him, no expectations, and it came out great. I think this is the beginning of his comeback, he is no longer under the weight of having to make good on being Hollywood’s “it guy” wonderkind. &&[He'd hate that one too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWs5TTn19qk)&&I've seen this several times throughout the thread. Yeah Get Out was great and Jordan Peele is a good writer, but that doesn't mean everything associated with him has to be *stunning*. This poster isn't an amazing work of art. &&Yeah, from an artistic standpoint, it's horribly generic and plays entirely on the viewer's love of and/or knowledge of Get Out to sell it. This poster is lousy. &&> why does many people think Get Out is anti white?

It's not anti-white, they think that because they're idiots.

I'm someone who always tries to be polite on Reddit and other places, but there's no other way around it.&&Horror happens to actually play pretty well into the hands of comedy -- a well-timed comedic break from a great horror movie can be funnier than any pure comedy movie&&You know I never considered it but there are a lot of similarities between Get Out and an episode of the Twilight Zone or Black Mirror&&I'm so fucking happy that absurdism/slight amounts of avant-garde are being represented in the mainstream. My unrealistic wet dream is Jordan Peele being a writer on a David Lynch script.&&This is my favorite kind. Psychological thrillers? Is that the term?&&And for scaredy cats like me to actually watch.&&[deleted]&&> The studio has signed Peele to a first-look overall production deal with his Monkeypaw Productions banner. That project is looking to have a larger canvas than Get Out as the budget will be about five times bigger than the low-budget movie Peele made with producer Jason Blum.

Yup, they've got the right idea.&&Jordan Peele Dark Cinematic Universe?&&To turn him into the next m night?&&Studios love horror movies (edit: and all of the related subgenres) because they tend to be VERY cheap to make, and can make big returns. Get Out only had a $4.5m budget, but returned over $200m. Saw did around $100m on a $1m budget. For an extreme example, Paranormal Activity made $200m on a $15,000 budget. Even its bigger budget sequels were pulling in 30-40 times their budgets.

Even after using ""Hollywood math"", these films are low risk and have high rates of return.

Something from Peele is damn near guaranteed financial success after the critical and audience reviews of the Get Out. Expect his name and a reference to ""Get Out"" to appear in very large bold letters on all advertisements.&&HBO just did a Penn State movie. I'm an alum and even I'm getting fatigued with it.

Jason Blum (who obviously produced Get Out) is producing Dee Rees's (Mudbound) next film, which has this smalltown lesbian plot. Easy mix up.

Edit: here's the link to Dee Rees/Jason Blum movie http://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/blumhouse-dee-rees-horror-lesbians-1201816048/&&>	smalltown lesbians 

wow yes. &&""Where's the funny parts?""
""WHERE'S THE FUNNY PARTS??""&&I’m not sure why people consider it a horror. Might be just me but it was more of a thriller than a full on horror to me.&&It's not as simple as that.

They gave Neil Blomkamp two attempts after District 9 and they both didn't do as well as expect or I imagine desired by the studio. You want your investment to allow you to make other investments. Usually, the rule is an added 50% of the budget is given for marketing these big movies.

Blomkamp also made District 9 for $30 million and had a $210 million dollar haul. If it add $15 million for the marketing then you have a $165 million dollar positive. Which means it made 4.6x more than it cost to make. Elysium brought in $286. Cost $115 + $57.5 for marketing. Which means it made 1.65x than it cost to make. Chappie brought in $102 million. Cost $49 million + $24.5 for marketing. Which means it made 1.38x than it cost to make. He has been doing some interesting stuff which short films but studios aren't as willing to give him loads of money anymore. He's on a down tick.

I bring up Neil Blomkamp because while Jordan Peele is a much better writer (just won an Oscar for it), and also just made his directorial debut to a smash success, studios will only back him if he can make money for them. I just realized M. Night Shyamalan would've been a better example for this. If Peele starts down ticking then so will his opportunity for big budgets and financing.

TL;DR The Oscar and the success of Get Out will allow him to make films for a while but if they suck, studios won't keep uping their budgets.

Edit: Grammar. He still has a huge writing and directing career ahead of him and I look forward to his next flick!&&Super unlikely with the talent involved though.&&He'll be fine if it's at least ok. &&The ol' Shamalamalyan&&Yup, everyone needs to remember Michael Cimino's Heavens Gate. Cimino had a ""do anything you want"" budget after Deer Hunter and the movie was a 4 hour borefest that ruined his career. &&Nah with a *commercial* Oscar, his movie jail is three bombs from now. &&Heh I feel that Get Out was good enough that they would give him a pass on a shitty movie... Look at M. Night Shamalamadingdong&&Unique take on racism in the modern age, a mystery that’s very unpredictable in regards to ‘what is going on’, every scene is filled with tension or intrigue that leaves you wondering and if not it’s building character(sometimes both) , every character is so interesting that you could literally make a spin-off about any one of them and it’d be great, the movie is REALLY funny  &&I think its because its unique. Its an original idea thay was well written, well acted and well directed. A lot of the big blockbuster hits are pretty similar. Theres always a Marvel movie or a sequel to something near the top of the list. A lot of the horror movies are the Jump Scare types. And there always seems to be a movie based on this or that popular book. Get Out was different though. I agree that it isnt the second coming of cinematic jesus, but i think that for a lot of people it was a a good quality change of pace.&&Art about racism starring black people is hot right now.

To be clear, I still think it's a very good movie, but that boosted it. &&But he didn’t direct Keanu lol.  The only thing he did besides acting and producing that Key didn’t also do was write the screenplay, which still wasn’t a solo credit&&Lol I fuckin love his honesty. Crazy that he is sticking to thriller/horror instead of tryna fall back on his comedy. Can't wait for this one&&Ok but Keanu was a great movie. Just a comedy, but hilarious without a doubt &&And Twilight Zone.

I don't know when he sleeps.&&So does winning an Oscar &&[deleted]&&I heard they spent a lot of time creating the monsters. Get out doesn’t have any monsters (at least literal ones) so I assume it was faster.&&*Sterling K Brown&&Oh I know she got that role, the jungle book, and even her BP role based on her AA, but I think she's gotten *better* roles offered to her post BP.  Because before then her biggest roles were all motion capture.&&That's what I was wondering actually.  She wrote a piece and mentioned that she wouldnt work on anything his companies were involved  in.&&What’s what?&&You know, I just looked it up, and it doesn't look like it's a thing.&&Now begins the 10-month wait.&&Future Oscar winner&&He would have voted for Obama a third term if he could!&&I know, right? They could interpret them as SJWs or virtue signalers if they wanted to! They should love the movie!&&Feel you there.&&What the fuck is going on with Reddit lately? I’m not used to seeing both sides of an argument upvoted.&&As a kid, I watched ""An American Werewolf in London"" and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I was so grateful for those little breaks in the tension. &&In a lot of ways his comedy background makes so much sense to me, especially a show like Key and Peele, some of their sketches were pretty damn theatrical.  I feel like his mind just naturally goes to premises that are more out-there and interesting than an average horror writer though.  There's a lot of comedy premises that, if you really think about them, could be turned into a complete nightmare scenario with just a little bit of tweaking.&&Cabin in the Woods is a perfect example of that&&Jordan Peele is actually also supposed to be doing a Twilight Zone reboot for CBS I think. Prior to Get Out I would've thought he's a weird fit for that, but Get Out was basically like a racially-charged episode of The Twilight Zone lol.&&Lol of course. It's disturbing in a way that you never knew you'd get disturbed by. &&i always say its a key and peele premise done as a black mirror episode.

&&I consider Get Out a full fledged Twilight Zone movie. Perfect blend of humor and horror. Makes you think. Gets under your skin the more you think about it. Tons of social commentary like Twilight Zone always had. &&Of garguantuan proportions depending on whether the outcome is positive.&&Jordan Peele horror with actual money this time? FUCKING SOLD. I wanna see him lose his goddamn mind.&&Keep in mind that larger budget =/= better end product. Sometimes restrictions allow for better results, as contradictory as that sounds.&&If this one's a hit, they might tap him to reboot it.

Imagine a team-up between Peele and Del Toro&&Better than the current DC(E)U&&You really want ANOTHER Mousecop origin story?&&Watching this high was fantastic. So absurd&&I thought it was retardedly awesome.&&I read around here that there's a new edition with brings back the old drawings &&Producing.  John August (frequent collaborator of Tim Burton's and Co-host of the amazing Scriptnotes Podcast) and directed by Andre Orvedal (Troll Hunter).&&Also I have heard of homeless people who have intentionally committed crimes in order to have food and a warm place to sleep.  &&yeah that shit gave me chills. &&Oh thank you so much! Yes that’s totally the mixup. I guess I just assumed they were working together again on the project and it got mushed up in my head. 

Thanks for the clarity and link!&&TS motherfucking A&&It definitely was satirical as well, the whole goody two-shoe racism, with a brutal ending &&What’s the difference between thriller and horror? I know that sounds like a bit of a dumb question but I always thought they were the same.&&it had unnecessary jump scares IMHO&&To continue the logic of your point comparing him to Blomkamp though, we have to keep in mind that Peele's debut had a budget of 4.5 million dollars- and that pretty much anything Blomkamp does seems to have a budget close to 10x that, as his background is sci-fi and CG. So, while I'm sure *Us* will have a *bigger* budget, there's a pretty small chance it's gonna cost 115 million like Elysium did, so the risk of it underperforming is *much* smaller.&&There was also a time when M Night Shamylan(?) had a blank check and Mel Gibson was a sex icon. Not saying Peele would go that route but stranger things have happened.

Edit: okay guys, you can argue with me whether or not Shymalon had unlimited funds but people were trashing his shit within three years of being nominated for Best Director and Best Picture. I’m not suggesting Peele will crash and burn because he seems to be a pretty with it but it’s odd that you can’t see any timeline where he fucks up and doesn’t get unlimited backing for his next project.&&I actually believe it's easier for him to flop now. I believe THIS movie is his real trial because now everyone is going to be expecting big things and that's a lot of pressure. When he did Get Out, no one genuinely could have guessed it would be this good and so expectations were low. 
(Get Out is an amazing movie, I don't want to come off as saying otherwise. I'm just saying that now he will be under a world of pressure to make a movie just as or more amazing than Get Out)&&Tell that to Michael Cimino or Neil Bloomkamp or Fernando Meirelles... All one hit wonders who made a great movie then fizzled out. &&I agree. With the all the thought of every little detail going into Get Out I find it very difficult to imagine Peele delivering anything less than amazing. With that being said, there is always room for error. As another user has said, this is a huge trial for him. 

Deliver something as intricate and captivating as Get Out, he’s golden and on course for being one of the best. Fall short and, well, fall short of greatness. As long as Peele takes his time and perfects this film rather than rush with the hype surrounding his name, he will be fine. I have faith in him. &&I would also say that the acting in the film is good to excellent. Daniel Kaluuya especially was very convincing and deserved his oscar nomination. 


His [scene](https://youtu.be/12z7e1sUyKM) with Catherine Keener where she puts him into the sunken place for the first time is incredibly well paced and acted. Even if the latter part of the film fell flat I would still be blown away by that scene.&&You hit the nail on the head about the characters. I think you could easily make a short film about almost every major and semi-major character in that movie. For some, it would be a comedy (y’all know who I’m talking about) and for others it could be a thriller or offbeat drama. &&The premise was that white people are creepy and shouldn't be trusted and the so called twist was that they were creepy and should've been trusted. The movie was predictable.&&Who is considered a cinematic genius other than Hitchcock&&Maybe it was that though, first time screenwriter and not director. I just remember his having some mild chagrin mixed with humor over the situation. But I may just be mis-remembering and I'll have to print a retraction in a journal of record someday.&&He's still doing comedy though. He and Key have something in the works, think it's based on the substitute teacher bit from Key & Peele.

Jordan is great in everything he does so personally I'm glad he's not limiting himself to one genre. &&His horror has a ton of comedy in it.&&Wasn't he on board for a Twilight Zone recharge? What happened to that?&&I mean Get Out had more solid humour in it than most pure comedies released in any given year. If anything the pitch black nature of the movie made the moments of levity all the better.&&He also has a 10 month old kid!&&He needs someone to stir tea.&&Wait is twilight zone getting a reboot?&&Yeah.  Casting starting late 2015, shooting taking three weeks in early 2016, and the movie out in January of 2017.  And who knows when they finished editing.&&Yeah I don't know why they were trying to hide her face in big budget productions, she would have been infinitely better as the same character but without motion capture in Star Wars.&&Yeah no doubt he just needs that right role him and caleb landry jones will deliver a performance for the ages just watch &&Atlanta has some amazing actors. I love Lakeith, but Brian Tyree Henry is amazing as Alfred.

But yes. I'm looking forward to this. &&Lose*&&How surface level the “scary” stuff is. Generally in both genres, tension and fear is everpresent. However, in a horror film, it’s more in your face: jump scares are plentiful, gore and death tend to be front and center. In a thriller, these things can still be present, but they tend to take a backseat to dramatic irony and more psychological methods. A movie like Shutter Island is a good example of a thriller. You never quite understand who is actually telling the truth, you spend the whole movie in a creepy environment, etc. 

Edit: here’s a more complete example: http://davidhohl.com/horror-vs-thriller/&&I actually literally did a presentation on Get Out and the impact it had on the thriller genre on Monday. Based on what I found, thrillers usually try to touch on the psychological aspect; something like 'The Shining' where every moment is suspense that is built up. In Horror you almost always know that something scary is going to be thrown in your face. Gore, fear, and more of an emphasis on violence than actual tension. Atleast that is the way I think of it.&&Oh I totally agree. My example was more to illustrste big debut successes and how the small future film returns lead to smaller opportunities. Peele will have a much longer life span because the movies he's planning are more small to medium budget which will allow for an easier return and a longer life span for the director. Much like how M. Night Shyamalan is going back to smaller budgets and is finding a new breath of success with The Visit and Split.&&And the massive goodwill Neil Blomkamp has lost since District 9.

Movie budgets blow my mind.&&Hard to believe this guy was a former slap ass addict. &&This is one of the most dangerous attitudes. Basically the problem is anytime a director fails, the blame from the outraged Reddit targets studio executives who they are convinced ruined the project by meddling.

So let’s say this movie comes out and is disappointing, that’s what will happen. Conveniently ignoring the fact that these executives are the ones who have him the budget in the first place. And surprise, a director who made one pretty good film is not automatically some genius who can do no wrong. Good directors make bad movies all the time.&&Bigger picture is *holy crap they made get out on $4 million???*&&I feel like I'm missing something. I know everyone was blown away by Get Out, but why is it automatically assumed that everything from Peele going forward will be mindblowing?

I fuckin loved that movie and Jesus Christ, I caught Chappie on tv a year or so ago and I made it halfway thru. How did anyone involved in that piece of shit justify that film?

I’m not saying Peele would go that path because he seems to be more aware, I’m just saying, one major fuck up and Hollywood will kick you to the curb just as quickly as they sang your praises.

He showed he could deliver a message about something wrapped up in something else and make it entertaining. Get Out was great, but everything was on the surface.

I don't think he's a good example of what you're trying to prove. Even if this flopped, Peele would still get other shots at it. Josh Trank & Neil Blomkamp are probably better examples.&&Agreed, I thought it was very good but I think it just worked in the current political climate which the Oscars like so that's how it happened &&And Sicario!&&> TSA

It's just bizarre that *it is* reasonable.&&I don’t think Get Out would have been a better movie if it had a bigger budget. Seems to have worked out perfectly.

This can't be true. Even Chappie grossed like twice the production budget.

There is literally heaps of screenplays and adaptions waiting to be produced. Surely, if he had the desire, they'd allow him to direct any of those potential films. The only explanation in my mind is him rejecting these offers.&&Dude needs to team up with Microsoft and make a god damn Halo movie. Best shot at a comeback right there &&Damn that's a bummer. I think Bloomkamp is a great director, he just needs a good script to work with. &&what was it? one of those youtube stories?&&I found myself surprised by how much I liked Chappie. Heard the negative buzz and didn't see it. Randomly decided to watch it one night and I found myself routinely asking when it was going to get really bad. Yeah, Die Antwoord was pretty annoying but I quickly came to the conclusion that they were supposed to come off that way. So their overall performances didn't completely turn me off like I thought they would. Its definitely a movie that doesn't follow a normal structure or cadence, but really neither did District 9 with its switches from documentary to narrative styles throughout the movie. And I really enjoyed the ending and its twists.

Its no where close to an amazing movie, but I thought it was actually a pretty good spiritual sequel to D9. More so than Elysium, another movie I feel gets a little more hate than its deserving but it was definitely a mediocre sophomore effort by comparison to D9.

EDIT: Die Antwoord...I knew it was something close to that.&&Like having a super strange hip hop group with no actual acting ability be the main leads in the movie? &&His short films have been great.

I feel like I've been living under a rock&&You nailed it. Even a decent budget horror/thriller gets about 10m. Don't breathe and Purge Election Year were about 10m. Jordan is getting double that. He's earned every dollar he gets and more after Get Out, but 22m shows a lot of trust in him. &&True but have you ever watched credits to a movie? All those people have to be paid and that's on the beginning of where all that money goes &&I'm friends with some of the folks who used to be Runic Games and helped them beta test Torchlight II. At one point I found out the game at a $16 million dollar budget. This for what is essentially a small-scale (30 or so people) indie game published by a much larger company (Perfect World). At the time it only felt bigger because it came out around the same time as Diablo III (and in fact I'm pretty sure if people weren't placing them as if they were in direct competition with one another TLII would have done way less numbers). It makes me shake my head that we're at a point where 'small' games end up costing around $20 million. &&I get you. You're just saying how crazy it is that *that amount* of money has become normalized to the point of being ""only"" 22 mill for a film shoot. &&It makes more sense when you watch the whole credits. Thousands of professionals need to get paid for a year or so, not to mention catered to.

Space needs to be rented, locations need to be travelled to, etc.

Modern movies are logistical marvels to rival a wartime deployment.&&Most of the budget for this type of movie is what’s called “top line.” Meaning what you pay the talent (actors and director, writers etc.). 
Peele’s probably getting paid $3-5m per movie now. That alone doubles the budget of Get Out. &&22million is a great budget for someone like him. He's been slowly and surely working his way up this ladder. I think people should give him the benefit of the doubt. Some of the increase in funds is about him being paid for being popular but also because he's hiring other people who are marketable. It might also mean that are budgeting a longer shoot to have more time to work. He's proven himself at every other budget level so he will probably be smart and give himself the time/space to do it the way he wants to. You can see in all the different projects how much attention he gives the aesthetics and visual aspects of his work, I really think he's gonna make something cool.&&Get Out? Probably about the same. That was such a tight script it didn't need more budget/cgi. It was perfectly effective as is. 

I feel more money would have resulted in a different type of film. Could have been better or worse.&&What's the ratio of Key Nickles to Peele Bucks?&&GATAV also made a billion dollars in 3 days when first launched just in sales.&&Except a billion of that came in the first weekend and they’re *still* selling copies of the game by the boatload...&&Yet&&Shh don’t give them ideas &&Not yet&&Just toys and apparel &&I already pay a premium for IMAX, the larger theatre with reserved seats, concessions, 3D, and D-Box.

IIRC, that film earned something like 10x its production budget. Then the next two films, Elysium and Chappie, only earned double their production budget. If I understand correctly, that’s considered mediocre in Hollywood terms (but not bombs). &&Sure it grossed twice the production budget but  your not adding how much marketing cost. A quick, sloppy way to get average market is to 1.5 times the budget.

1) Can you table the fact that Die Antwoord is in the film? If yes, you'll be fine. If not, you're going to hate it.

Let's add a third cause why not—if you can't get over the fact that they link PS4s together for computing power, you're going to hate it.&&I had no idea they were going to play such a prominent role in the movie going in, but I'm really glad I was listening to them a lot prior to seeing Chappie, because I rather enjoyed them in it- though I can see why others didn't. If it'd come out a month before, I probably would have been 100x more confused and weirded out.&&It does require some knowledge of Die Antwoord to understand why they were in that movie, which is in no way present within the film itself&&I thought they actually worked as a couple of people abandoned by the world and ready to leave it all behind.&&I love Die Antwoord and thought they were perfect in the movie but I totally see someone hating their inclusion in the film if they weren't familiar with the group &&Oh I completely agree. Aside from D9 of course. But IIRC Blomkamp was trained as a digital modeler and animator, then transitioned into directing/writing, so it does make sense that his writing pales in comparison to his art direction. &&Even then, the last airbender still grossed 316 million, so he hasn't filmed a bomb as of yet.&&Can we frame this for defining Reddit?

On the whole, his work has really been quite steady  His work has been cyclical, having a peak year and a low year more or less every decade and a smooth trend between each.  Biggest individual years were

1986: 8 movies -- Several TV movies

2003: 6 movies -- Mostly *Matrix* related, and *Something's gotta give*

2016: 8 movies-- quite a variety, stuff I don't really recognize and expect to be those more 'artistic' things actors like to do after their career is stable and they can take some risks.

&&John Wick 3 started filming yesterday!&&Did it need *reigniting?* I always thought Keanu just did what he wanted. &&Fuck yeah. Gun fu really jump-started his career again.&&""Reignite""? That fire never went out&&Most non-heinous!!&&they both hold up really, really well&&You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!&&I heard that in Abe Lincoln's voice. &&Yes but, how will they ever get Eddie Van Halen without a triumphant video?&&[deleted]&&EVH should totally do a cameo here. It’s not like he’s busy playing guitar lately. &&We're decent without Eddie, though.&&I came here looking for exactly this. I miss George Carlin. 😭&&Marlon Brando was in Superman Returns....&&They're planning to have George Carlin's daughter be in it, and they'll also have Rufus in old footage.&&[deleted]&&Plus you got an excellent martian butt!&&Yes?&&Why do they say station? I never understood what it meant. (I'm a big fan, but I just never picked up on the significance of it.)&&So-crates!&&I'll never not upvote a post like this.&&https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CelebratedPlasticCardinal-max-1mb.gif&&It's one of the very few sequels that I like better than the original. 

Heaven and Hell, the Reaper, killer ~~cyborgs~~ robots, and a gigantic Martian butt! You just can't beat *Bogus Journey*.

edit: thanks /u/StoneGoldX. It's accountability like this that makes us all better people.&&It's tough because the tone for most of it is so different than the original.  In like it, but I love the original&&[deleted]&&And that soundtrack!

First CD I ever bought.&&User name relevant!!!!&&Damn straight. The climax of that movie is one of the greatest ever.&&When it debuted the reviewer for the Toronto Star declared it was better than the first film in a review that was an unrestrained love-in.  Someone with better googlefu than me might be able to find it.&&That Easter Bunny still haunts my dreams&&I’ve been holding off on watching for so long because i thought it would ruin what i thought of the first one. With the recent threequel news and now this, i know what I’m doing tonight!&&I agree. It’s where I get my username. &&Station!!!&&You ugly!.. red!.. source of all evil!&&It was the Grim Reaper, not Satan!&&Nobody riffs better than Keanu Reeves, **NOBODY**.&&That's the text alert on my phone.&&I could totally see those two naming their daughters Bill and Ted.&&The whole description of the plot sounds like they will be retconning the finale of Bogus Journey.&&Last I read with the writers, their kids will be in it.&&The most important film of the decade.&&Probably Keanu. He's got an insanely busy slate.&&I ctl+f that word to see if somebody else mentioned it.

A sequel is after, a prequel is before. When the fuck does a threequel take place? During? Ala BTTF2?&&It's weird that people are totally fine with this unusual made up word.&&http://www.dictionary.com/browse/threequel&&Keanu had to use gray dye in his hair so people wouldn't show up at his home with stakes & holy water, unironically of course. &&They’ve been saying this (completed script, director from Galaxy Quest) for about 8 years. I don’t see anything more official in this article. The day I hear they’ve actually started filming, I’ll be excited.&&That photoshoot was just part of their ""reuinion"" set of pictures.  They got a bunch of people from older movies to be in them.&&He has been talking this up for years &&The script for this is AMAZING!!! Don't worry, it all comes together and rocks. So happy they finally secured finance and distribution. Party on!&&As long as they have a blast doing it and take us along for the ride, I'm down.&&To be fair, the writer/creators didn't initially plan for that ending, it came about during production. If I am remembering the blu ray documentary correctly. &&Reality undid the ending to Bogus Journey. God Gave Rock & Roll To You clearly did not align the planets. So much like Terminator 3, they have to figure out what went wrong.

Hopefully, it won't suck like Terminator 3. &&They visit Heaven again and she marries God and becomes the entire human race's stepmom.&&It's not going to happen.&&Well......not exactly but it is as close as we will likely get. 

https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/05/07/goldbergs-snags-rick-moranis-reprise-spaceballs-dark-helmet/578401002/&&Rumour was that the sequel was going to be called Spaceballs 3: The Search for Spaceballs 2&&You too! What a coincidence &&plug in Willie Nelson and the show keeps moving forward! &&I feel like this is Keanu helping a bunch of his old buddies out, because he's cool like that.&&>They should get Ringo Starr to play Rufus.



This is the only appropriate substitution. *Most Excellent*&&Knowing Keanu, he'll make sure Winter gets equal screentime.

Remember, this is Keanu Reeves we're talking about.&&I have in my head that all Keanu Reeves movies actually follow the same character in different parts of his life. &&YES WAY!!!&&They have old footage of Rufus, planning on using. &&*warm applause*&&I drove through it a couple months ago, and sadly discovered it was not actually shot there. &&~~SAN DIMAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL RULEZ!~~
SANDIMASHIGHSCHOOLFOOTBALLRULEZ!&&Also from SD. Hope they film more of that good ol ""western"" suburban culture for this! &&Excellent&&So Crates. &&Station. &&If I were Napoleon, stuck in San Dimas, where would I go........?

WATERLOO!!&&How’s it goin’, Mr The Kid?&&Well... one did. &&[They've already said that he'll be featured in the film using old footage.] (http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a848292/bill-and-ted-3-title-plot-keanu-reeves-face-the-music-movie/)&&Too bad no Clarence Clemons either...&&He’ll be there...

He’ll be there.&&If you think about the Bill & Ted story, if George Carlin were alive now, it would probably not make sense to have 2018 George Carlin in the film as he would be like 30 years older even as this wouldn't make sense within the story.

Rufus came from the future, so he would have been like 50-ish in whatever year he came from in the future, and then he was 50-ish when he went back to the 1980s. So then how old should he be in 2018 within these films, when Bill & Ted are 30 years older? It certainly wouldn't make sense for him to be 85, because I don't think he stayed back with them and aged alongside them.&&May I recommend Héctor Elizondo??&&Keanu practically looks like him in that promo shot. Uncanny. &&[deleted]&&He's way overdue. Been killing so many people lately. &&I dunno... I'd kind of like to see him play this movie in a more John Wick tone lol.

Actually you know what would be kinda fun?  If they just went full meta with this movie.  Reference Speed, Point Break, The Matrix, John Wick, hell even the Lake House, all of it!&&Bring it on down to Flavortown.&&I call this a deconstructed Bill and Ted.&&Comment of the day.&&Man, I watched that movie recently and was really surprised at how well it held up. &&YES!

An uppy wasn't enough. &&4 out of 7?

Heh heh get down with your bad self &&""Don't overlook my butt, I work out all the time and reaping burns a lot of calories""&&> ""Don't overlook my butt, I work out all the time and reaping burns a lot of calories""

I think my favorite throwaway joke from that movie was the end credits.  Death Wins Indy 500 ""I didn't know I could run that fast""&&Station!!!&&Watch Cobra Kai...they got it right.&&I'm 50/50 on it, too, but I get the feeling that Alex and Keanu are doing it because they want too, not because they have too. Which gives me hope.&&During their history report? The song is Walk Away by Bricklin 

edit: Play with Me: Extreme (Mall breakout scene)

The Boys and the Girls are Doing It: Vital Signs (Napoleon at the waterpark) 

Father Time: Shark Island (first time through the circuits of time with Rufus)

I Can't Break Away: Big Pig (opening credits) 


In Time: Robbie Robb (when they land in the future ""they sure play excellent music"") 

Two Heads are Better than One: Power Tool (starts when they pick up Joan of Arc and the montage and plays during the closing credits) &&No kidding, no one else stood a chance for the role of Vulture in Spiderman: Homecoming &&I quite liked Man of Tai Chi, I thought he did a pretty good job with it.&&The Other Guys brought back Keaton to bigger budget films&&I finally watched Spiderman Homecoming last night. The Vulture was fucking amazing!!! one of my favorite Marvel Villains now in the MCU.&&Wow four decades of acting is insane for how young he still is perceived.
&&At first glance I thought this table was referring to Keanu's age.&&Really? Where? How? Who? When? What?&&2008 to 2013 was rough. Starting with the major flop of The Day the Earth Stood Still and ending with the brutal double whammy failures The Man of Tai Chi  and 47 Ronin. No matter how cool and content he seems with his career it was definitely a rocky period. &&And I think he misspelled the matrix.&&Yet, truly bodacious!! &&Absolutely non-non-triumphant.&&Iron Maiden?

Most comedy sequels like this, especially done decades after the originals, suck. If they just try to recreate the original movies, it's going to be non, non, non, non heinous. If they have an original story that needs telling, beyond just getting the band back together (and I think there is something in that God Gave Rock & Roll To You was supposed to save the universe, and it didn't), then it'll be most triumphant. &&His stand-up really withstands the test of time.&&CGI Carlin. Rogue One and Bladerunner 2049 showed me that we can faithfully resurrect old characters without being super creepy.  &&He was.  And how'd that go for them? \(I'll take a shot at the answer, Meh, it was ok\)&&Orson Welles' last movie performance was *The Transformers: The Movie*.&&Station?&&Don’t overlook my butt...

Not biological matter. &&It's amazing that they decided to go the route they did with bogus journey. The sequel could have easily been another histroy report rehash but instead we got the awesomeness that is bogus journey. I always point to Bill and Ted as an excellent example of a sequel. Station.&&and Primus!&&For bonus points, those robots were in both Breakin and Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. They were Boogaloo Shrimp and Pop'n Taco. Or Pop'n Pete.

One of my favorite movies and I don't even like the original. Sometime somewhere I was wondering ""how the hell did this even get a greenlight?"" and someone linked me to [Key & Peele's answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM).

I'll have to check out Bogus Journey now.&&Would people hate me too much if I said Ghostbusters 2 was a good sequel as well?&&Terminator 2: Judgment Day?&&I guess The Dark Knight is an okay sequel too.&&You should play Mario 2&&What’s wrong with the beginning?&&Battlestations!!&&Same here.

DUH.  &&I think the threequel definitely comes before the queequel&&I looked it up, because I agree, this sounds stupid, but apparently this word has been around for a few decades.  I am almost 40 and have never heard this word.&&Dumb and Dumberer made perfect sense.  Too bad it wasn't anything like the first.&&Keanu From Earth&&The official bit is that they have distribution and funding now. One of the main reasons it was stuck in development hell is legal issues with the character and film rights. The fact that contracts have been signed and money is being put in place shows that these issues have been resolved and filming can now take place in the near future. &&To be fair, that was a lot to expect from a Kiss song.&&So this is how democracy dies.&&Yeah it was mostly shot all throughout the Phoenix area where I live and a lot of us know and recognize the locations.&&The area where it was shot did not in fact have Circle K stores, so they brought the signage with with them to the shoot.&&Grew up in San Dimas, and this film and Raging Waters were the only things that gave our town an identity&&sixty nine&&Soccer Tees!&&StaTIOOOOOOON&&I’m still hoping he was able to end his life as an orgasm.&&They should totally do it like an Obi Wan Force ghost!&&They mention in there that the studios keep wanting to make it a reboot instead of a sequel and they've had a lot of trouble getting funding because of that. Just put it on Kickstarter. I'd plunk down some cash to help stem the tide of unwanted reboots.&&Maybe they can have Ringo Starr fill in as Rufus&&I miss goofy Tom Hanks too. (Not counting David S. Pumpkins, which is, its *own* thing.)&&Whoa!&&Watch, he'll kill at being a goofy as fuck dad with a garage band fantasy, and he'll *get a fucking Oscar for it*.

Get it, he'll *kiiiilllll*..... never mind.&&He's stared far too long into the abyss.&&Woah&&The last time I saw him in a comedy was when he had a cameo in that forgettable Chris Kattan show about Bollywood&&Never thought of that.  Someone has to have done a tally of all of the murders at the hands on Keanu.&&Yeah, I think he's been fighting his own vibe with all these action movies, no wonder he's ready for a change.&&And also all of Alex Winter's movies! /s&&[deleted]&&It would be extremely cringy and they should not do that.&&Have you seen Knock Knock? No thank you. &&Movies that are only based on references don’t really end well. (Read: Ready Player One)&&I feel since they did time travel and after life stories they should do parallel universes with their characters. You could have bad ass Keanu in one of those worlds. &&Hey, that's cultural appropriation, unless you're from Flavortown you can't use that phrase.&&Amen.&&I’d rather Beat Bobby Flay&&I too have watched any Chopped episode ever. &&This is just John Wick with a laugh track.&&Never give up, never surrender.&&Its the perfect level of parody, satire, and genuinely good sci-fi action. 

And Tony Shalhoub is just great.&&Easily one of the funniest lines in the whole movie&&No I was meaning the scene with the future dudes, turns out it's In Time by Robbie Rob and it is an absolute anthem. &&You're my hero &&You just made my afternoon at my desk that much better.  Thanks for putting this together!&&One of my favorite villains in the MCU, the twist with him blew me away, they did a really good job at keeping it quiet. &&He must reflect sometimes on the fact that he went from winged anti-hero, to meta-role about a fictional actor reprising a winged superhero, to a winged villain.&&I love Keaton, but I'm still sad we missed out on a Raimi/Maguire Spider-Man 4 with Malkovich as the Vulture.&&I did too. Keanu's acting was kind of funny though: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYI00mKc_yA&&Every person did a hilariously fantastic job in that movie, but Keatons performance was maybe the most memorable. &&One more thing, do me a favor; don't go chasing waterfalls. 
&&Jackie Brown brought him back from the dead. Tarantino loves giving washed up actors a new life.&&You know what they call that?

They call it a Soup Kitchen.

""Thanks for the F-Shack""

From Dirty Mike and the boys.&&Yes. Earth. With money and cameras. Reeves. Yesterday. John Wick 3 is filming.&&The cinematographer posted shots from Day 2 on Instagram.&&The studio got fucking stupid with 47 Ronin. I remember reading that they had actually shot most of the movie with the japaese guy as the lead and Keanu was only in it for like 20 minutes then the studio was like ""no. We can't market this in America, reshoot with Keanu as the main character."" &&Bummer about that too, I thought 47 Ronin was really cool and fun. &&Time traveler, can confirm, Keanu does have a major resurgence in his career in 20013. Still looks great btw&&> 2008 to 20013

I mean, 18.005 years for a immortal being such as Keanu isn't all that much....&&EXELLENTA! DINEEINERININERNEWWWW. (how does one spell an air guitar noise?)&&Execute them!&&Well, how can they have decent instruments when they don't really even know how to play?&&There’s so much fodder for this though. We know that Bill and Ted entirely changed the future but we don’t know much about how. 

Not saying it won’t be tricky to find a good story in there but there’s plenty of opportunity. &&I'm guessing they will not call each other ""fags"" in the new one.  Hahaha&&If anything, he's gotten more relevant. I don't think he'd be surprised by Facebook and selfies, but we know exactly how he'd react to it all. &&I got to see him once. He was hilarious and worked so hard to give a great show despite some jackass pulling the fire alarm and the sound system cutting off. &&I think he would have self-immolated if he was around when Trump was elected.&&Exchange Reagan with Trump, and it sounds true enough: https://youtu.be/GPbca0lm_s0&&Obviously, the dude's a Time traveller&&What are you talking about? The scene with jor-el was powerful and I loved the tech behind it. Other than Kevin spacey it was the best part of that movie.&&This shit matters.&&But they could get a full-on robot chubby.&&It’s not better, but it’s more fun to watch.&&It's very similar to Gremlins 2 or any Evil Dead sequel, in that it completely fucks with the premise of the original movie. &&It started kinda rough in spots. Winters shoehorning in the repeated ""shut up, Ted"" from the original (coming down the stairs after Bill's dad was banging his wife in Bill's room) didn't feel organic at all. &&Maybe if you do them girly-style&&*STATIOOOOOONNNNNNNN!*&&We actually live in an alternate reality where he [cultivates bizarrely enormous pumpkins](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2005/10/08/faith-no-more-guitarist-squashes-competition/).&&It's a similar deal. Bogus Journey was fairly simple. Teenage stoner (minus the drug references) Back to the Future, with less incest. For the sequel, you'd assume more time travel. Nope, they kill them off, go to Heaven and Hell, get super sacrilegious, and have almost no time travel whatsoever. &&*""It's called brainstormin' not braindrizzlin' sweet pea, okay?""*&&I like it. I know all the words to 'On Our Own' by heart.&&Meh, it was entertaining when I was growing up, that's all that matters to me.&&The writing wasn't as witty, but it was a ton of fun. It certainly wasn't the disaster that was the reboot. &&I rewatched it recently and it really is a fun movie, definitely very “of its time” but enjoyable. Lots of little touches that I didn’t get as a kid. &&It’s definitely not as bad as people make it out to be. Yeah, it’s weaker than the first, but it’s still fun.&&Its a good sequel, I think much like Gremlins 2, its overshadowed by the more iconic original.&&He said ""underrated,"" not widely regarded as one of the best sequels of all time. &&Almost mentioned that. :) Refined to perfection.&&[deleted]&&Love T2, but is it underrated? &&Lol in no way is that underrated my dude&&They said underrated. T2 is widely and critically considered the best action film ever made and one of the best sequels ever made. Nothing underrated about it.&&TDK is not underrated&&High on the list of greatest sequels of all time. &&[deleted]&&I think it holds up as a time capsule of that weird period between hair metal and grunge. Music was in a strange and wonderful place for what seemed like just a couple of months.

Edit: I double checked. B&TBG came out in July 1991. Smells Like Teen Spirit came out in September 1991. So yeah, it was just a couple of months before the old guard collapsed...&&I can see the plot twist at the end of the movie clearly now...They had the wrong Bill & Ted the whole time! The scholars from the future had inaccurate info. It was never *that* Bill & Ted, it was their daughters Willamina and Theodora (also Bill & Ted) who wrote the music that unified everyone & everything. 

Edit: removed a useless word&&Thanks to the princesses, yes. :)&&Lots of things have to line up perfectly though, whether he wants it or not.&&It's an abomination that should be destroyed!

""Sequel"" and ""segue"" have the same etymology. It makes no sense for the third installment to be called a ""threequel"" without having a word for the second installment. The threequel is the second sequel, and it makes no fucking sense to call the first sequel just ""sequel"".&&Station!!&&Yeah IIRC the movie studio that did the Bill and Ted movies went out of business and was bought out at some point.  &&Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.&&[deleted]&&Dust...

they should have hired Guggenheim &&Funny how back in the day you could have an entire movie very clearly made for stoners without a single drug reference.  Cracks me up because nowadays, you would have to have a scene of them hot boxing the phone booth or getting Attila the Hun stoned or what have you.&&There is still a fair amount of time travel but yeah the big chunk of the story was about their death and resurrection.

Warner Bros Sets ‘Sherlock Holmes 3’ for Christmas 2020,45293,8hrjlm,https://www.thewrap.com/warner-bros-sets-sherlock-holmes-3-christmas-2020/,1694,1525731473.0,,"That's a week after Avatar 2 releases. Which is very interesting, considering the first Sherlock Holmes was released a week after the first Avatar. In fact, both Avatar 2 and Sherlock Holmes 3 will open on the exact same day as the first film in their respective series.&&> There is no confirmation whether Downey or his co-star, Jude Law, will return to the series.

How are they honestly going to do it without them.&&Still waiting to hear if Hans Zimmer and Richie are confirmed and then it'll be right proper.&&No wonder why it took so long. RDJ's schedule has been filled with Marvel movies these last few years.&&Please get Ritchie back to direct though &&Holy shit it's actually happening.&&Will Gavin be behind the camera at all? &&Still waiting for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. sequel :(&&Now I now why Robert's hair has been looking like a mess as of late.&&> Other Warner Bros. films currently planned for release in 2020 include the third installment of the “Fantastic Beasts” series, “Godzilla vs. Kong,” a new “Scooby-Doo” animated movie, and the DC superhero movie “Cyborg.”

One of these films feels unlikely to happen...&&Whoa, I hope Ironman and Dumbledore reprise their roles. &&I dig it. The first 2 were pretty fun&&If someone had told me 5 years ago that I'd be more happy to see another RDJ Sherlock over another BBC Sherlock season, I'd have laughed in their face.

I am surprisingly ok with this.&&Yes finally, I hope it is Hounds of Baskerville. Also I would be extremely shock if it setup a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Cinematic Universe.&&RDJ booze hound-slap fisticuffs better be in this again!&&I really missed Rachel McAdams's character. I loved the chemistry between Irene and Holmes. I hope that Noomi comes back as well though.&&I wonder what the conversations between RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch were like on the set of Infinity War.&&Love these movies&&Guess they had to wait for RDJ to stop being Iron Man&&Everyone loved these movies independently. Like there wasnt a huge discussion when I was younger about them, it's just everyone loved them.&&Oh a sequel we actually want. Nice.&&I am quite pleased with this, though I do sort of hope that Rachel McAdams returns. Her off screen death in the second is still a bit of a sore spot in the series for me. &&YES! Best news all week. Fucking love the first 2 and Zimmers music. &&Are the other two any good?&&“Where are you going, Stanley?!”&&God I love these movies. As long as RDJ, Jude Law and Guy Ritchie are onboard I am there in spades. I would watch RDJ and Jude Law read Wikipedia on screen for three hours.&&Quick! Let Gavino Free know about this! &&Something tells me RDJ will be free to do more of this kind of thing in about a year.  &&2 *more* years ? christ almighty fucking hurry up willya ! the dr doolittle reboot won't satisfy my rdj need i require more   &&How the f*ck is it 7yrs since the last one already?! &&YES YES YES YES YES&&Only if Guy returns. &&Phenomenal! I have a huge soft spot for these movies. They're what got me into the original canon and all the other adaptations. Hopefully whoever they get to write the script is a fan of the source material like the writers of the first two. I would be heartbroken if we finally got a third movie and it wasn't good or failed to accurately portray the characters. &&I think they would be better off setting it in the late 1800s.&&I'm not sure if I liked the movies or not. It did some things good, others not so much. I really appreciated how they helped dispel the misconception that Dr.Watson was a fat oaf, but they perpetuated misconceptions about Irene Adler and they, for lack of a better word, Americanized Holmes. 

I'm curious what the plot could possibly be. They've established that they're not adapting any of the stories, just doing their own things, so there's nothing to follow.&&I was hoping for more Sherlock V Sherlock hints in, Infinity War. Perhaps a single, ""no shit Sherlock"" line. Even if it be delivered wittingly by Star-Lord. &&now let's get a King Arthur sequel&&I thought it was cancelled lol&&This is awesome. The first one is my second favorite movie&&If this means Guy Ritchie can continue the Rock-n-Rolla trilogy, I'll be very happy.

If it doesn't, I'll be bummed but still be entertained.&&2020, because RDJ is too busy being Iron Man right now.

But seriously, I love these movies, can't wait! &&I'm a huge Guy Richie fan and loved the first two movies... but, I'd be kinda intrigued to see a new director take on the series! 

Guy Richie is known for the his classic fight scenes and unique style. But we all know that Sherlock Holmes has some amazing classic stories and these actors are phenomenal. So, I'd love to see this cast take on a classic Sherlock story with a dark spin on it, by a director like David Fincher or Denis Villeneuve. &&I hope Hans scores this&&About bloody time&&Although critics never really got behind the films, I actually liked them. They were both considerably violent, but also really clever written and had some nice humour in them.&&I won’t believe avatar 2 exists until I see a trailer &&I think that was credited as helping Sherlock Holmes success. People would buy tickets to Sherlock Holmes because tickets to avatar were sold out. I know that's the only reason I saw it, I went to see Avatar for like the 2nd or 3d time and it was sold out, so I just went to see Sherlock Holmes.&&If my math is correct, Avatar 3 will release a week before Sherlock Holmes 5&&As someone who likes both, I'm alright with this, because I get to see a new movie every week!... for two weeks...  

I do worry about it hurting sales though, but maybe the genre difference will keep it safe.&&...Wait, Avatar 2 is actually releasing? Is this confirmed? I thought everyone had collectively stopped caring about non-airbending Avatar.&&That’s if Avatar doesn’t get pushed back again lol&&I'm guessing this release date news means they are verryyyy close to announcing their return.

They were probably waiting for Downey to be done with Avengers 3/4 and for Law to be done with Fantastic Beasts 2.&&“Danny Trejo is Sherlock Holmes”&&Haven't both said they'd love to return and do a third film? Seemed like they genuinely liked working together and with Guy Ritchie on the Sherlock films.&&There would be no substitutions good enough to replace either of them.  I hope they both re-sign. &&https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1255919/

Oh they can definitely do it without them.&&Downey has said before that it's ""a lot of fun"" to do these movies with Law.  Of course, that's no confirmation, but I hope it tips the scale toward them returning.&&“Hey, Christopher Plummer, I think I got some work for ya”&&it would be wrong without Zimmer's playful Viola arrangements.&&Right proper!&&5 MCU movies in 4 years.

I wonder if he ever takes the Iron Man suit off.&&I just realised both iron man and dr strange are sherlock&&Also the writing had been going through an arduous process.&&10 years with that movie and it wasnt like he took breaks either.&&He just signed up to direct some crime-drama film 'Toff Guys' so hopefully he gets that done quickly and signs up for this.&&And do a Man from U.N.C.L.E. sequel! I never got to see Armie get the girl...&&[removed]&&They should get Edgar Wright for this. &&Guess im the only one with my Willie in my hand waiting for Real Rockanrolla to be made &&Delighted with this, loved the first 2. doesn't seem to do great critically but the public seem to love the movies. Really looking forward to this now&&I never thought I'd see the day. I thought they'd given up in the face of Sherlock, which would have been a damn shame considering the existence of Elementary.&&Is guy Ritchie directing?&&He certainly won’t be in front of it.&&Gavin Free?&&I hope so. That scene in the second one was amazing. &&I'm right there with you. :(&&My friend and I (back in undergrad) saw the trailer for the 1st one, were super intrigued, got tickets for it opening weekend, and loved it. No one else I know has even heard of it...

We don't live in the same city anymore, but I'd drive to go watch it with her if they made a sequel. &&I really liked the King Arthur movie...

No one else did :/&&I'd watch that but give me Rock N Rolla 2 God dammit&&Armie Hammer as Illya was unf af.&&Somehow I doubt the DCEU can survive long enough for them to get to 2020...&&Iron Man, Mar-Vell and Night Nurse.
  
I can just imagine most well-known actors having an MCU character in future.&&Probably why it's happening.  An Infinity War victory lap, if you will.  ""Okay, we'll let RDJ work on some other projects now, and for the people responsible for DCU, at that.""&&They were both pretty great. But I have a love for the first one. “Is it poison Nanny!?”&&They're both pretty fantastic&&Nah, I've always loved RDJ Sherlock. BBC Sherlock show hates its fans&&The RDJ Sherlock gets some things really, really right about the source material.  I can say a ton of good things about the various BBC and screen Sherlock Holmes interpretations in the 60s through the turn of the millennium but they seem to over-emphasize his intellect and forget that the literary Holmes was a champion bareknuckle boxer, martial arts expert and wrestler, who would start bar fights for ""training"" and who was widely respected in the criminal underworld for having given a number of notorious toughs ""a right drubbing"".

His only weak spot was his poor marksmanship, and in that area Watson filled the gap admirably.&&It's official: Iron Man is better than Doctor Strange.&&i missed BBC's more. &&I would love a good Hound of The Baskervilles adaptation that doesn't involve some stupid psyops military operation like in Sherlock. &&Holy shit I wasn't a big fan of these films but I would be so excited if it was a gateway into a LoEG reboot. You just made my day, I'm going to hold onto this hope as long as I can.&&Isn't Sean Connery retired? &&The first movie I fell so in love with McAdams character. And I realised it was McAdams herself I loved. &&I hope they referred to each other as Mr. Holmes just to annoy everyone else&&I was disappointed that *Infinity War* didn't have a joke about that&&It's hard to go wrong with Guy Ritchie, Downey Jr, Law, McAdams, and Hans Zimmer.&&so excited for a new one, they seem really underrated

love rdj's sherlock&&RDJ will never stop being Iron Man. 

RDJ is Tony Stark. &&Are you telling me you don’t want Avatar 2?&&It was off screen so maybe there's a chance she'll come back?&&I didn't like the death either, but a ""Deus Ex Machina"" revival sounds so unappealing to me. 

Probably since BBC Sherlock stuck one in every damn episode, so by season two there was zero tension because you know they're just gonna come back. &&I personally really loved them. The first one is what got me in to the original canon. They have great action, a lot of heart, a fantastic score and the chemistry between Law and Downey is wonderful.&&They're a lot of fun! Nothing earth shattering...just make some popcorn and have a good time.&&If you havent seen them, definitely do&&I say yes. My dad and I watch these together fairly often and always find new things we hadn’t noticed before. I love them.&&worth watching if you haven't.&&pretty good, don't listen to the critics' reviews since they're only butthurt that it isn't super canon.&&theyre decent. some stuff is a bit of a reach to suspend your disbelief. &&I liked the movies for what they were, but they never *felt* like Sherlock Holmes movies to me. &&Or, there’s potentially anything to follow.&&An Americanised Holmes is a very apt description. He felt very much like an action hero. Maybe if I didn't know much about the source material I would have liked it, but the discrepancies just annoyed me too much.&&Benedict thought it would be corny to say something so obvious. Instead Tony did say ''Do you concur, Doctor?'' at some point in the movie. When they were making the plan on Titan I believe.&&There was a ""Doctor, do you concur?"" which is a pretty well known line from the books. &&The writers and directors said it would’ve been too easy and would’ve came off as hazy writing, I’m inclined to agree with them. It sounds great in theory but when I think about it in practice I think it would’ve failed drastically.&&""Do you concur, doctor?"" was that.&&> ""no shit Sherlock"" line

stop  

this &&By 2030 it'll be a 20 part movie series that will release every four months starting in 2033.&&Its the Duke Nukem Forever of movies. &&I won’t believe Avatar 2 exists until I’ve already seen it and even then I’ll be a little suspicious.&&Zoe Saldana the actress who played Naitiri posted a video on her Instagram not long ago where she was clothed in a motion capture costume and even said that she is waiting to get out of the trailer for the next Avatar shoot. They started filming last year.&&I totally believe it's happening, and anyone that's been to Disney's new avatar expansion in their animal kingdom park would too. They put way too much effort into that thing for there to only ever be 1 movie. &&And guess what? They'll use Papyrus again.&&>I went to see Avatar for like the 2nd or 3d time.

Can't tell if it's a typo or a very clever joke...&&[deleted]&&Nope, just Reddit. They have a weird hatred for that film for some reason. Despite championing far worse movies.&&Reddit just likes to hate popular things. They've been filming (motion capture) for months now. It's definitely happening and I for one am super excited&&Still seems preemptive to announce a general release date imo. They must be
extremely confident. Either that or they're winging it without RDJ and Law which doesn't seem like it will end well, but what do I know. I'm from /r/movies. &&Jude Law is also filming Captain Marvel, like, right now &&> for Law to be done with Fantastic Beasts 2.

of captain marvel.&&Man these guys careers really took a nose dive after sh 2.... Poor guys...&&RDJ somewhat announced his own return to Sherlock Holmes 3 years ago:

> Yes, we have a Sherlock 3 in development. We want it to be the best of the series, so that's a pretty tall order. *Also,* Perry Mason is a property I'm looking forward to developing further, going back to the 1931 book series...similarly to what we did with the first 2 Sherlocks, mining the original material for things that are ""new.""

Avatar in IMAX 3D is easily the best theater experience&&I didn't know there was hate for Avatar. Wasn't it the highest grossing movie for a while? I mean, I loved Avatar. Yeah it was basically ferngully on an alien planet, but still visually it was stunning. Avatar is a good reason why people should go see movies in theaters, it's an experience you can't get at home. It was stunning and breathtaking. The story was bad or anything. The acting was fine. It was just a very predictable plot and simple/basic, but that's okay with me.

But with Sherlock I only made it through one episode before I quit. The mystery was more poorly executed than the RDJ movies, and the character portrayal didn't work for me either. From the little bit I've watched and from what I've heard in reviews, the BBC series does the two things poor adaptations do when the writers aren't clever enough to make a genuinely clever character. They make Watson less intelligent and more confused than he is in the books to make Holmes look smarter by comparison, and they skip over key details in how the mystery is solved, instead leaving us with solutions where Holmes does some mysterious smart-people wizardry that they don't explain, the bad guy just shows up and says ""here I am, I did it"", or Holmes is just given the answer off-screen by a third party. It's more interested in telling you how impressive Holmes is rather than showing you Holmes doing impressive things and explaining how he did them. Kind of like NuWho.&&I don't know who keeps giving Moffat shows to run, but they need to stop.

But he is much more brash and physically orientated in the RDJ films - it's a difference in the overall direction and aim really, it's more like a Victorian Indiana Jones than a Sherlock Holmes movie. Not that it necessarily makes a bad film, but I just couldn't enjoy it.&&You best be wary, every living thing there wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.&&Neither is James Cameron talking shit about every sci fi movie that wasn't made by him.&&People really underestimate how amazing it was to see that movie in 3D, especially in the theatre at release. I have a 3D setup at home and it's *still* the best looking 3D movie I own. &&Pretty sure they're not talking about you seeing Avatar multiple times but about the ""3d"" instead of ""3rd"" typo.&&Can you explain why you liked it?

""Oh... that Avatar.""&&I don't know man, gettin' an old fashioned in the back corner of the theater is really something.&&The likelihood that Tony survives IW Part 2 is very very low. And if he somehow does, they've already set up a potential Pepper Potts ultimatum (""It's me or the suit!"" or ""I'm preggers"" or something like that) to get him to leave the Avengers permanently.

I think RDJ's getting a long-term break from the MCU one way or another.&&He actually just got an Avengers tattoo along with some of the other actors.&&Break from the MCU? He consistently says it's the greatest thing that's happened to him. He's essentially the godfather of the universe. He loves working on those movies. I don't think he's tired. He's done the soloist and the judge while being in the MCU and more. He's an actor and hes not in an MCU film every year so he's fine. 

Edit: he made 150mil from infinity war fwiw. Yeah he's tired of that! 

Edit 2: For those that don't know, infinity war 1 and 2 was shot as one movie. In this article it says he will get 200 million, not 150, my bad

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/avengers--infinity-war-part-1/robert-downey-jr-200-million-salary/&&He has it the easiest out of all the Marvel characters that have to wear a suit or makeup or costume or whatever too.

Spider\-Man trilogy: 2002, 2004, 2007.

X\-Men trilogy: 2000, 2003, 2006.&&It's only a bit more spread out than the original stretch of films. From 1979 to 2002, there was a new Star Trek film every 2 or so years.  That's 10 films over 23 years, so they've got a bit of catching up to do&&He did shots for Top Gear before he did Sherlock, too.&&That's why he had a phantom at all. He just borrowed the one from his workplace.&&He also did some work on The Grand Tour.&&When they say Gavin is wealthy, that's not a joke, he has worked many major blockbuster films and paid well by them/royalties from his work. He actually was the protégé of the only guy to own a Phantom camera in Europe initially and worked on multiple productions with him too &&I don't actually know what Rooster Teeth is and I'd never heard of the DP before, but I was definitely a fan of his work in the Sherlock movies.&&If they'd just had done what they did with wonder woman with every DCEU hero, itd probably be more popular than the MCU. &&Pretty sure Infinity War makes that too easy. &&""She was in the way of our love, Watson!"" &&Oh yeah.

I know it makes me sound like some sort of ""I liked <insert band name here> before they got famous"" hipster, but I've had issue with Moffat's writing for a long time on Dr. Who. Sherlock S4, and in hindsight some stuff in earlier episodes, made me acknowledge that that's thing with him&&I know exactly what you mean.  I watched the first episode of the latest series and couldn't finish.  There's a pretty long [youtube summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoGBOs5ecM&t=5254s) that sums up everything you need to know about the series.  It's a fun watch if you have the time.&&The wedding episode was one of the worst written, most contrived, boring, vapid, abysmal episodes of television I've ever seen. ""Hey, here's a case I'm working on, a guy keeps ghosting his online penpals, oh turns out he was planning a murder and that murder is taking place at John's wedding, which was previously not connected to the case at all"". The only good part of that episode is when they're drunk, and even that was ruined by the editing.&&You know it worked when nobody caught on. &&Yeah much better than the ""no shit, Sherlock"" reference fans were asking for on Twitter.&&It's one of the only films to use it properly for atmosphere instead of schlocky effects. &&[deleted]&&I think the only way they leave him alive is if he becomes director of SHIELD. 

Kill off Nick Fury, Tony becomes director, you keep the guy who hand the biggest hand in creating the MCU and he takes a cameo-only role of steering the new heroes. &&I think he's dead and the whole we have a baby together foreshadowing conversation seals it. Nothing says ""I'm not coming back from this"" quite like a baby named after you. &&What are the odds that Pepper steps in as Rescue if he dies?

Not that high, considering I, a filthy casual, only know about Rescue because of my Marvel wiki-trawling.&&for the love of god, we cannot give Gyneth Paltrow the satisfaction of being the reason Tony quits the Avengers.

Here's hoping for an irrevocable but meaningful Tony Stark death.&&If he survives I wouldn't mind him taking a supporting guy in the chair roll or a mentor as needed&&Didn’t he already give up the suit at the end of IM3? I’m kind of behind on the Marvel movies. &&Bye Pepper. &&Arguably the odds of Stark surviving are pretty high.  ""Iron Man"" will probably retire though like you suggest.  Stark makes a lot of sense as a Fury-type background character, helping pull the franchise together without being a main character.  Minor parts like what we saw in Homecoming mean he has a presence, and the nature of the CGI suits means that you can actually film action scenes if you *really* need to and all they have to do is show up at RDJ's house for a few hours for some HUD shots.

On the other hand Captain America is very much a lead-from-the-front type of role and they have plenty of that.&&That Avengers tattoo is, in every sense of the word, a brand.&&Really? I haven't seen any pictures of that, happen to have a link? &&You can still love something but want variety. I imagine Sherlock's a fun series too, in a different way. &&Was he in the The Rural Juror?&&It could be the greatest thing that’s happened to him. Doesn’t mean he doesn’t want or need a break. 

The thing about these big budget series now is not, like Sean Connery was worried about, being type cast. That’s not really a thing anymore. 

But these movies are a drag for actors. There’s hours and hourse sitting around waiting for shots to be set up for CGI, or re doing them, or having motion capture rigs all over the place, or acting in front of green screens instead of real locations or sets. And then there’s a huuuuuuuuge promotional responsibility at the end of it. 

He may like the end result. He may love the money. He may love the clout it gives him to do what he wants. But he still might want a break from doing two huuuuge movies back to back. &&> hes not in an MCU film every year

Eh, almost.&&People with ""superhero movie fatigue"" for some reason think that the actors themselves also hate those movies lol.&&He never phones it in either. Continues to develop the character and brings his best every time. You can tell there's no resentment (cough Natalie Portman) or disinterest  (cough Jennifer Lawrence)&&iirc he's said things about wanting to be done in the past.&&Yeah. And since Tony is ""just a normal human"", physically speaking, he doesn't even have to work out extra hard, I guess. Same for Mark Ruffalo.&&also im 99% tony stark and RDJ now have the exact same clothes and style. he just shows up on set does his scenes and goes home.

&&[deleted]&&Rooster teeth is an internet company consisting of a bunch of gamers. They have a huge network of let’s play channels, including Achievement Hunter, Funhaus, Cow Chop, a bunch of others. They started out doing a show using the game Halo called Red Vs Blue, which is on its 16th season iirc, plus RWBY and a few others. They’ve been around since before YouTube was a thing. &&Moffat is a great script writer but a shit show runner. If he doesn't have someone to parse his good ideas from his bad ones and keep him from committing every dumb thought he has to script  he eventually disappears up his own arse and takes the show with him. &&To be honest the second episode of season 4 is pretty solid, I'd recommend it. But I will admit that season 4 episode 1 is hands down the worst episode of the entire series. (The third episode is also pretty bad)&&I mean, I’m glad they took the less obvious route, but I’m not going to pretend I wouldn’t have loved if they didn’t.&&I agree. That's because James Cameron saw the tech for what it could be, which was enhancing theater experience rather than bullshit gimmicks. Avatar was a meh movie as far as plot and writing goes. But the visuals and cinematography in 3d make it a solid A rated movie imo. 3d isn't meant to be all ""Woah look at how in your face we can be."" 3d in theaters just adds depth and makes things looks so much better. He filmed it with 3d cameras instead of the majority of movies that add the 3d in post. It makes it look fucking GORGEOUS. And I'm fully looking forward to seeing the next one in 3d.&&Now I want a 3D Matrix.&&Well, SHIELD would have to be re-established officially. It’s like the six people on the TV show and some red shirts right now. Also, Fury hasn’t been director for a long time.

That said, Tony is wearing SHIELD garb in A4 set photos. They’re doing something with either time travel or the multiverse, so hold on to your butts.&&[deleted]&&It seems more likely to me that they kill him and give Steve something to the effect of that job. Although i suppose it would be hard to make a criminal into the director of SHIELD suddenly.

Either way, Bucky comes out of this with the mask.&&But who will say ""motherfucker"" without Director Fury? &&I don't know what they're doing with the TV series, but do you remember Coulson?

He's been the director of the remnants of SHIELD for a long time now, though the time line is a bit iffy because he got promoted by Nick in the show way before the Hydra takeover happened in the movies.

I stopped watching the show a long time ago and also am not up to date with the movies currently, so I don't know what's happening, though. &&I could also see them naming the baby Steve, with Tony surviving and Captain America dies. But The movie will likely end all the OG
avengers stories minus 

Edit: meant OG instead of OP&&If Cap can take the big enchilada he will. Jumping on a grenade is his thing.&&I really thought Iron Man 3 was setting up a Rescue storyline. I was disappointed&&Not high at all, considering that Gwyneth Paltrow is supposedly a lot less big on the MCU than RDJ.&&Pretty high since Paltrow was reportedly doing mocap scenes &&No I’d much rather him leave happy to start a family than having to kill him off. The precedent of having to die to leave the MCU is dumb. &&He said he did, but then he had new suits in every movie after that. I think his revelation was more so that he's not his suits.&&He couldn’t kick the habit. &&Since IM3, he has appeared in the Iron Man suit in Avengers 2, Civil War, Spider Man, and Avengers 3. So no.&&He used the clean slate protocol. He never said he was giving up the suits for good, clean slate implies he was just destroying them all to start from scratch. 

It was all a bit of a metaphor for him finally overcoming his ptsd from Avengers, which is why he was building all the suits to begin with, and working towards the new goal of taking care of Pepper. &&Of course..here you are https://www.instagram.com/p/Bie3WhknTSQ/&&[Clicky](https://nerdist.com/avengers-actors-matching-tattoos-infinity-war/)&&In a guy ritchie way.&&""Instead of playing an eccentric genius asshole good guy billionaire I get to play an eccentric genius asshole good guy.  Variety.""&&Maybe, but a gauranteed payday and a fraternity of professionals you like and like you are things that I could see keeping him working in the MCU.&&Watch RDJ and Jude Law on The Graham Norton Show when they were promoting Sherlock 2.

If you ignore Jude's stupid beanie he was wearing (turns out he was hiding his hair for a role...not that he has much anyway), you can see the two of them seem like they get on insanely well together.  It's the happiest I've ever seen RDJ in an interview, and they had genuinely funny stories to tell from filming.

I think they work brilliant together and are the reason why the Sherlock films work and did so well, with RDJ stealing the show a bit but that's expected...dear Watson.&&Roar her, gem her?&&I think it was Urban Fervor. &&The MCU movies RDJ appears in:

* 2008 - Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (cameo)
* 2010 - Iron Man 2
* 2012 - The Avengers
* 2013 - Iron Man 3
* 2015 - Avengers: Age of Ultron
* 2016 - Captain America: Civil War
* 2017 - Spider-Man: Homecoming 
* 2018 - Avengers: Infinity War
* 2019 - Untitled Avengers Movie

From next year, he will have had 3 years of not appearing in a Marvel movie.&&He's been in a marvel movie six out of the last seven years.&&Chris Evans is though!



Edit: From 2011-2019 Captain America has been in at least 1 film a year&&That's exactly what this guy is getting at. RDJ just made 150mil for IW. You really think he's getting tired lol? He said he'd like to do it as long as he can. And he's in his early 50's, a great age for acting. &&*Trejolmes&&The guy from Ally McBeal and the guy from Gattaca?&&It's weird and I loved every single minute.&&He’s here to steal a necklace from a wizard&&“Earth is closed today”&&No, [Squid!Ward](http://kneelbeforeblog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/vlcsnap-2016-05-18-16h59m58s425.png) was in *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.*&&Get lost&&Not well.&&5 out of 10 so far.&&Odds weren't in their favor.&&Or just be Batman&&Also successfully pulled off black face.&&Well yeah if you just wait, you'll be 50 in no time. Make some use of that fantastic time and life that you have! Get good at a few hobbies! Travel the world, make love to a beautiful women, and enjoy what _really_ matters in life.&&Thats different. The tolkiin movies release in sucession because they are the same story and filmed at the same time.

And if harry potter was released like star trek we would all be middle aged by the time Squidwardmort killed harry.&&Those are kind of special cases though. For LOTR and The Hobbit they were filmed them all at back-to-back and once. For Harry Potter they had to worry about the kids ageing so they had to film them quicker.&&Lord of the Rings was also all filmed at once. There wasn't a break in production between any of them.&&You're saying a few cheap 3D shots of Mila Jovovich throwing a knife at a zombie or a building exploding in exchange for a more expensive movie ticket is a *bullshit gimmick?*

Utter plebian /s&&Unless the movie in question is Jackass 3D, and they launch a dildo at the screen.&&Sweet&&Think they would steal the council of Richards stuff from Fantastic Four and make a council of Starks that help with that Thanos problem?&&Not that it really matters, but Maria Hill is the acting director of SHIELD.

(JK it matters a lot but probably only to me.)&&I'm pretty sure Chris Evans has said multiple times he's done, whereas RDJ seems to love the movies and people only think they'll get rid of him because he costs so much. 

Plus, Captain America is a mantle with an obvious lineage awaiting. It's harder to hand it off to Bucky if Steve is still alive. &&I was sure they were headed for BuckyCap but with multiple instances of Bucky being called by a different hero’s name in Black Panther and IW, I think they have a different plan for Barnes’ redemption arc. 

I think FalconCap or a new deal with Chris Evans is most likely, with a longshot Agent 13 as Cap in third place. 

I think any non-powered replacement will need some sort of augmenting arc, so that might be a clue to look for. &&If it's between Iron Man or Captain America staying alive, my money is on Iron Man. He's gpt such a great on screen presence and the mentor dynamic with Spider-Man is something they would probably lile to pursue further. And now he's got a repoire with Dr Strange, Hulk and the Guardians. Captain America could easily be swapped out by Bucky or Black Panther or Black Widow as the battle leader role.

That being said I think that if any of the big four survive, it will be Thor and Hulk. Iron Man and Cap have had their time to shine, and Thor and Hulk are only just now starting to get more popular and interesting thanks to Ragnarok and Infinity War.&&Ehhh if anyone is going to be hard to sell its bucky as captain America. An infamous assassin/serial killer being turned into captain America would be pretty difficult.

If anything falcon would make more sense&&Except contracts are kind of a giveaway.  Last is heard Chris Evans hasn't signed on for anything.

In universe though, it makes more sense for Steve to die.  Tony was a SHIELD director in the comics.  He's already done ""smaller"" parts in stuff like Spider-Man: Homecoming.  He can provide a lot of tech and support without getting directly involved.

Rogers is a leader but he's a ""lead-from-the-front"" kind of leader and that's not what they need.  Bucky can do that part easily.  Plus all the tension you'd get with Stark never quite trusting him.&&I hope they do it this way just so they can recreate [this panel](https://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/iron-man-mourns-captain-america-civil-war-6.jpg) in some way.&&I mean, they already kind of did that in AoU with Clint’s baby having the middle name of Pietro&&I think Gweneth Paltrow isn't interested in continuing much, or it would've gone that way (or something similar).

Shes basically only had like 3 scenes since Iron Man 3 and she never really seemed into the role very much.&&I'm looking to upset the real-life Gwyneth Paltrow. If the plot of a movie needs to bend to my will, so be it!&&He would never leave happy.&&On the second loop I just realize RDJ wear a glass with one square and one round lense.
&&For real?!&&I wish he'd fucking make Rock N Rolla 2 already.&&You could almost switch Downey for Cumberbatch and this would be the exact same with the Sherlock series and Dr. Strange. &&I always got the feeling he was very wealthy in the Sherlock movies &&Rur Jur?&&No, it's gotta be ""Oral Germ Whore.""&&I wonder if he ever gets tired of the truckloads of cash dumped on his front yard every year.&&Thank you for your service 🙏🏻&&*will have had&&Iron Man came put 10 years ago.

Fuuuuuuuuck&&As a random side note, I'm very glad things are going this well for him.  

He's turned out to be a stellar guy and I'm glad his talent has a place!&&Why would you choose to use that scale, instead of the past 10 years (coinciding with the release of Iron Man)? Especially since he's been in a Marvel movie 8 of the past 10 years, so it's still close to once a year. &&Which must suck if he never gets a break from that insane workout&&He came from space to steal a necklace from a wizard&&Dude you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards&&Underrated delivery on that line. Could have been very lame/standard/forgettable, but I can all but hear RDJs tone, inflection and timing just by reading that. 


RDJ wastes no lines&&""Dude you're embarassing me in front of the wizards.""&&Say, isn't that Kit Fisto?&&Seemed like even odds to me.&&Detective chimp would like a word with you&&Yeah I mean my opinion on movies means nothing. My favorite movie is the matrix, I watch lord of the Rings once a year, and snakes on a plane is in my top  five favorites. Don't take me seriously. But avatar was God damn pretty and I'm looking forward to the next one.&&So... Coulson's alive?

Man, now I need to watch 5 seasons of a TV show to understand the movies as well? French Fries Salted...&&Infinity War Spoilers! 






[She dies post credits ](#spoiler)&&She ain't the acting director of squat right now...&&I haven't watched the TV series in a long time and am also missing a few movies, but I am guessing she's the public director? Like the public thinks she is, but really it's Coulson?

I mean, Fury gave him the job and all, but he had to stay hidden. &&They've done it in the comics.

I don't think they'll get rid of RDJ because he's expensive, just because his arc will be ended.&&Evans said that back when the Creative Committee was overseeing the films back in Phase 2.  Feige used that to go to Disney and get them to disband the CC to keep the talent happy.  Since then, Evans hasn't been as vocal on the subject.  &&Chris Evans said that a few years ago and recently said that he would be interested in coming back&&Didn't they already confirm Bucky as White Wolf? I don't see them jumping him from Bucky to Winter Soldier to White Wolf to Cap.&&I thought he changed his mind about definitely wanting to be done. If either survives tho i think itll be Tony so he can still have small roles like in spiderman&&It felt like they forshadowed Steve's death in Infinity War when ~~Falcon(?)~~ Vision reminds Steve of when he allowed himself to die to protect New York.  &&I think he’s just plying for a little bit more money and freedom with the role.  RDJ gets paid the most so he’s totally cool with just doing MCU forever.  Shit I wouldn’t be surprised if they killed him and then his brain was scanned to an AI and he’s like the new Zordon or Jarvis of the Avengers.&&Bucky still seems like the best choice to me. Falcon has been very nothing ever since Winter Soldier. Agent 13 has been little more than a love interest - I hope she has some time with Steve in Avengers 4.&&Groot as the new Cap&&I've been saying since his movie made its billions that Black Panther is going to be the new battle leader of the Avengers after infinity war. After seeing part 1 it definitely feels like they're trying to set it up that way too.&&Except he doesnt have any super powers. &&Bucky as Cap is amazing. He tries to cope with the guilt of his past while also trying to live up to the mantle that was created by his best friend. &&What's the context here?&&Ripped jeans, skin was showing. &&I doubt she expected it to turn into a decade commitment when she signed onto the first one!&&I doubt real life Gwyneth Paltrow cares either way tbh&&Fair&&I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow really cares about the fates of big screen comic book characters to be upset.

Also, Pepper Potts ≠ Gwyneth Paltrow, so Paltrow wouldn't be the reason that Tony quits the Avengers.&&Haha yes..he sure loves his wacky sunglasses&&Yes! The ending was such a damn tease! I *need* to know what happens with Archie and the Wild Bunch!&&Me. Fucking. Too. &&Imagine Tom Hardy (Handsome Bob) coming back built like a brick shit house telling Gerard Butler (One Two), he wants him.  &&Real Rock N Rolla&&I’ve been waiting so long!!&&Remember those days? Back when guy Richie and every other director didn't make adaptstions of comics, video games, prequels and sequels.

Rock n Rolla was an original IP. And it is over ten years old. &&There's no school like the old school and I'm the fuckin' headmasta! &&God that man does *cool* so well. Rock n Rolla and Snatch both ooze so much...effortless cool. 

And let's not forget about the masterpiece that was Swept Away.&&Slow down Tinkerbell&&I would give my left nut for that sequel.&&Yes!&&And The Imitation Game. &&I think it's explained in the books that he accepts payments from wealthy clients to offset all of his free client work and endeavors.&&But he doesn’t shoot lasers.&&rujar?&&at this rate he could probably just BECOME tony stark &&He has helicopters drop it since Age of Ultron, more efficient. &&he'll've'd&&Probably just went back far enough to have one year he didn't do a Marvel movie. That's a little more than 85%, compared to the 80% over the last 10 years. &&I mean, he is little different than any top tier athlete in that regard, except it is really just for appearance, so the wear on his body isn't as bad (or shouldn't be) + all the fame and fortune that comes with it. 

I'm just saying, there are plenty of people who has a work regimen similar to his without all the benefits... he probably doesn't mind it too much. &&""Mr. Stark, what's this guy's deal?""

""Uhh, he's from space. He's here to steal a necklace from a wizard.""&&Disney cut their originality budget in season 3.&&Perfectly balanced, you say? As all things should be?&&Snakes on a plane? Really? &&He's alive, but as far as I can tell, nothing from the show is ever referenced in the movies.&&Yeah, so does Fuey but people were talking about him ceding SHIELD in A4, so I was just mentioning her for posterity.&&Shield went public and had a more public facing director who was a fake inhuman.  Now shield is like literally five people so if Tony wants to scrap it and make a new shield I would be totally fine. &&>arc

Nice&&>just because his arc will be ended.

That hasn't seemed to bother them  since Iron Man 3...&&I don't think disney minds diverging from the comics if it means they make more money. RDJ definitely has the potential to make more money, but his price tag is outrageous. $200 million for avengers 3+4&&Interesting. What was the problem he was having? How have things been different since then?&&Might be to throw us off, really. Wouldn't surprise me with how elaborate MARVEL and Disney have been with hiding spoilers.&&I think it has to do with money

RDJ makes about the same amount as the rest of the cast combine or something..

I remember a while ago where everyone was trying to get paid more on par&&I wouldn’t say they’ve confirmed him as the White Wolf. A couple very brief mentions only from the people in Wakanda. Very easily could be a nod to the comics and they still give him the shield.&&Hmm interesting theory. It was Vision talking about how Steve's sacrifice during WW2 was any different than what Vision wanted, and Steve replied with his ""we don't trade lives"".&&What I want to see in Avengers 4 is a time jump.  Make it like a year later and the whole world/universe is totally fucked.  

&&We still have multiple characters to see in A4 and she’s one I’m really hoping we see. Of course its still to be seen what she, or really anyone will be doing, but I hope we see her nonetheless. Kraglin is another I hope returns, maybe tracing the Milanos signal after everything happens and joining that crew with some mostly mastered arrow skills. &&Spoiler Alert!


It's how Civil War ends.&&I'm glad to have you on board. I think a good compromise for us would be Pepper dying, and a flash-forward where Tony realizes she was Gwyneth Paltrow, and he finds true joy with his next love&&Don’t forget Johnny &&That movie had so many of 'before they were famous' actors.

Simon Pegg's Upcoming Horror-Comedy ‘Slaughterhouse Rulez’ Will Center Around A Fracking Company That Unleashes a Subterranean Monster,42485,8m3lp4,http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3500904/simon-pegg-talks-horror-comedy-slaughterhouse-rulez-subterranean-monster-movie/,789,1527269737.0,,">The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness.&&Now that's the delightful sort of concept that Hollywood does well. I'm excited.&&Like when BP released Cthulhu in South Park.  I member.&&That sounds fun. Nick Frost will also be starring in it. First information about it, I think.

> “It’s going to be really fun. It’s a sort of a horror comedy,” Pegg told the outlet. “It felt like the right thing for Nick and I to have as our first collaboration with Stolen Picture. It’s about a private school in the U.K. which sells off parts of its land to a fracking company, and the fracking company then unleashes a subterranean monster that terrorizes the school. It’s a big metaphor for the U.K. privatizing things, and it’s mixed up with some ridiculous, sloppy horror. So it’s right up our street.”&&Nick Frost + Simon Pegg = some of the best comedy ever&&I just watched monster truck. Similar theme, I'm sure Simon's will be much better.&&If you describe the plot of any of Simon Pegg's movies to me, they sound absolutely ridiculous and I'd never want to watch any of them.

Then I watch them and enjoy every single one of them. &&Edgar Wright isn’t directing :(&&This was a video game idea I pitched nary 2 weeks ago.  I tell you, famous writers and directors are always stealing my ideas from inside my head, developing them for years in the past and making them into actually workable premises instead of my vague concepts that go nowhere.

Thieves, I tells ya, time traveling brain thieves.&&Is it called “Coon & Friends”?&&The Cloverfield Fracking&&Slightly off topic, but one of my FAVORITE old time radio shows is an old “Quiet Please” episode about an oil rig unleashing a monster.  The episode is called “The Thing on the Fourble Board.”  The first time I heard it I was so scared that I stayed up all night until it was time for me to go to school.


I recommend it if you have the time, very fun little horror story: [The Thing on the Fourble Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWTi78zED1U)
&&Goodnight you princes of pain, you things of old England.&&Isn't that basically the plot to Tremors? &&Every time I hear the word 'frack' or its derivatives it makes me think of Battlestar Galactica and the sentence becomes so much more expressive.

It started with some drunkard type guy accidentally stumbling into a new tech-type job,  meeting an amazing woman, working with her and courting her over the course of the year, screwing it up because he's a screw up,  he learns from it, gets another chance with the same scenario as the start of the film, tries something a bit different... and viciously murders his friend (with a vehicle falling off a cliff and impaling him very gruesomely) then he's lives that year, tries again, causes a nuclear fallout scenario, tries again, again, trying to get back into the scenario with Her.

Eventually, he's tries to live for himself while being a decent dude,  his friend is working some shitty fast food work, the conditions are disgusting, the protagonist jokes about suing the place, makes a call to corporate and... gets ahold of Her. She's pissed about the call,  the jokes made, and the conditions of the place, but hero gets to meet up with Her. And that's about when I wake up. 

I tried to write down what I could remember into a blank text message on my phone... and it was pretty vivid to the point where I couldn't fall back asleep, so I tried to follow the Hero's lead and made some coffee for my sleeping girlfriend and feed the cats so she wouldn't have to worry about it before her Dr. appointment at 0830. Then I made promises to myself that I'd do x today, or y, and instead of neglecting them and playing Steam games like usual, I might actually follow through. 

Dreams are weird.&&[So, this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls2lvNYrZVI)&&stoked&&Premise sounds similar to an audiobook/audio drama that I listened to a couple years back called The Black by Paul E Cooley.

Don't care, gonna watch it anyway.&&There are fouler things than Balrogs. Ever hear of Morgoth?&&Yeah, it was a good example of show don't tell as I don't recall it being any explicit exposition about it.&&Nah, they were two separate things. The fracking was a problem with the Australian aboriginals in the area even before the outbreak, and the aboriginals were actually doing pretty well despite the zombie outbreak \(due to being able to hide their smell from zombies and being able to defend themselves\).  I reserve the right to be totally wrong about it, though.

Decent movie though, Martin Freeman had decent acting and its tone and pacing was different than most other zombie movies. It's kind of a sign just how ingrained the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse has become that it can just sort of be thrown out with very light exposition without actually being gone into much, and totally work.&&Sounds like Cloverfield. You'd have to follow the lore to know though. &&I want proper magic undead zombies, not sciency virus zombies.&&The acting and special effects (mostly goo) in that movie were pretty bad though. Bilbo wasn't all too convincing.&&Cargo is good&&If this a spoiler?&&Is that streaming anywhere? &&Does that mean patient zero will likely come from Michigan?&&I'd rather something like Grabbers, where the monster is dangerous and deadly, yet the movie STILL manages to be full of comedy that isn't out of place or stupid.

I'm confused.

They proved that it’s a threesome and not a duo.&&I have kids, and they saw it on Netflix. That's why.&&Do it for them kids!&&Me too!  I liked it but i was drunk watching it. &&What movie?&&Truuuuuuu&&Show him Matango from 1963 and blow his mind.&&Yep, I agree. Something something zeitgeist for sure.&&In a world of 7 billion people, no one ever has an original thought.&&But they are inspired by real fungus in nature...&&Alright but I really did spit ball that Steve Caroll and Kira Knightly end of the world movie at a party years before it came out.

I watched it once and never again. Nowhere near as rewatchable as the cornetto trilogy. &&That's what the internet is, right? &&Well thank you, always looking forward to that as well. One's in development for 2020, so I at least have a bit to wait before I can confidently point to anything and say ""look what I did."" &&Not really.  The booty sisters are probally not dead.  The cop is on an island.  Slink has to still be around.  It was a giant unresolved cliffhanger.  &&To be fair, Tolkien didn’t elaborate too much on the battle scenes in the LoTR. They were pretty short and he didn’t bother too much with them.&&How does thay scene still hold up after all these years? Its fantastic every time&&Really?.. Not every single LoTR battle.&&There’s a plethora of fantasy artists that drew the demons and characters from LoTR.

Now everybody kinda copies what was in the movies.&&It was actually far *better* than I had imagined when i was a kid, as was true of a few of the things in LOTR. It's literally the only book to film adaptation that I can say that of. &&Fuckin Gandalf always metagaming.&&HARUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM&&Oh, and that throaty rumble that you could feel in your bones in the theater? Give me goosebumps just thinking about it! Sounds design was insane! &&*porque no los dos?*&&[deleted]&&That’s one of the reasons I liked “A Quiet Place” so much. They just basically were like, “these things came and they’re here.... moving on..” I like when movies put enough trust that their audience *wants* to suspend their disbelief enough to allow expeditious world building in ways that aren’t long drawn out explanations by characters talking to other characters who all should know this information already.  &&What about a movie where they tell but don't show&&ZNation accepted the premise enough to up the exposition to a discussion of the various grades of zombies by a character into film studies.

On the other hand, the walking dead is so invested with the idea that no one on earth ever heard of zombies before that that is more unbelievable than zombies existing.&&Martin Freeman is in Cargo? So that mean’s he was in both Cargo and Fargo?&&The movie stands out from other zombie movies, for one because not many movies have the protagonist doomed from the very beginning.&&I mean, the original zombie film as we know them was Night of the Living Dead. I've only seen the remake, so it could be that the original black and white was very different (I know at least that the black character was treated much better in the full colour version), but even for that, the zombie apocalypse got very little exposition to my memory. ""What caused it?"" ""Well, some people said X, others said Y. In the end, what does it matter? Now board up that damn window."" Zombies work best when they're *not* explained in my opinion, they always have done. There's very few zombie films that worked when they explained it. 28 Days Later is the only one I can name off the top of my head. World War Z trying to explain zombies just made it fall even harder on its face.&&Yup, I'm gonna giggle if there's a Slusho reference.&&Yeah i didnt think he did a great job&&Nope, I watched it and never made the connection. &&It’s a Netflix movie.&&The Host (Korean 2006) did a good balance of a scary monster and humour.  It was like little miss sunshine meets Godzilla.  Really good movie.  &&Yep, agreed, it's so much tougher but genuinely compelling to create a horror that happens to be funny, than a comedy film with horror themes.

Not that both can't be good but movies like Shaun of the Dead and even Evil Dead are just in another league.&&Grabbers was one of the few movies where I actually cared about the blossoming relationship, told only by the way they looked at each other.

Great gem. Need that hinted sequel in my life.&&Have you seen Severance? You'd like Severance.&&*Tremors&&Paul was garbage I fully agree.

Wright is almost a tangible character in the Cornetto trilogy. He has such a unique style to his work that we shouldn't expect the same feeling to this film (not that it won't be great). I remember going into Paul expecting another SOTD or Hot Fuzz and realizing almost immediately how different it was without Wright.&&I know it wouldn't be a literal cornetto film but it seems pretty thematically similar in style. &&Edgar and Simon are like the Beatles - more than the sum of their parts. Without Edgar, Simon's writing is very weak. Without Simon, Edgar's films are soulless. Together, they are magic.&&Yup, he wrote and co directed [A Fantastic Fear of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk85_E4XUPM). &&They were great in Paul, and that was sans Wright.&&Is the movie bad enough that I need to feign outrage at you letting your kids see it or is it just mediocre?&&I was high and thoroughly entertained by it&&""A Fantastic Fear Of Everything"". Also a comedy with Simon Pegg. &&That's not true, they're just pretty rare.&&This movie is underrated as hell. Dragon fighting with modern tech AND Christian Bale? Sign me tf up. &&And Reptilicus. &&....if I have to enjoy a movie a certain way, its not that great.&&Baby Driver is still on my need to see list.  I find Hot Fuzz the only one on that list where Ill watch over and over again without question. Im just saying its like comparing Empire Strikes Back to something and saying its the representation of the entire Star Wars franchise is all.&&Why is it called the Cornetto trilogy?&&In my opinion Paul was funnier than The World's End tbh&&What's that?&&I think high speed people tubes will be available sooner than high speed, let alone any speed internet is available way out to my house,  sadly.&&Not to mention he wakes up on an island naked with like prison rock on a sign. It just screams Julian Slinks next big feature, reality tv set in the gritty, bloody bowls where bad men go 'after' the world's gone to hell. Not that any of you dumb dumbs will get it. &&Everything else, however....

They were brought back by radioactive contagion from a space probe that was returning from venus and exploded in the atmosphere. It's also the movie that gave us the ""shoot them in the head"" rule &&Wonderful movie with so many moments of ""OH shit, this is gonna be good""

And those moments suddenly twist around and you go ""...oh, what the fuck lol""&&I've had to go bat for this movie a few times because the humor detracts for some people but I adore it. I think the goofiness adds a lot to the proceedings. &&That's exactly what I thought of when I heard the premise of this film. Shaun of the Dead meets The Host. And I am fucking *there* for it. &&Exactly.

I watched Army of Darkness when I was younger, so not aware of Campbell really, or the theme.

I thought there were genuinely scary parts, then laughed at others.

It seems to retain the fantasy aspect while conveying the scene close to my minds eye. John Howe, who was a consultant on the movies I believe, did some fine work as well.

The ending is so perfectly british too. &&World’s End is pretty brilliantly written. Each pub name corresponds to an event that will happen there, character names identify them as medieval archetypes (King, Knightly, Page, etc) with matching traits, nearly everything in the first act is foreshadowing that is called back to later in the film, etc. It’s a remarkably tight and self-contained story. &&Agreed.

LOCK HIM UP&&The once untouchable is now on the cusp of being arrested. Good riddance. &&In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the special victims unit. These are their stories. Don don&&>Investigators in Manhattan were preparing to arrest Harvey Weinstein on Friday after a monthslong inquiry into allegations that he sexually assaulted numerous women.

>Mr. Weinstein is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday morning, according to two law enforcement officials.

.  .  .

>He will face charges in connection to at least one accuser, Lucia Evans, who has said Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him during a business meeting in 2004, one person with knowledge of the investigation said. It remained unclear if charges would be filed in connection to other victims.

>Prosecutors in Manhattan have also been investigating allegations that Mr. Weinstein raped an actress, Paz de la Huerta, in her home in New York City in 2010.

>Ms. de la Huerta made her claims to the police in late October, after [revelations in The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-arrest-new-york.html) and The New Yorker about Mr. Weinstein’s history of sexually assaulting women and paying or putting pressure on them not to speak out. In describing what occurred, Ms. de la Huerta said Mr. Weinstein violently forced her down and had intercourse with her against her will.

>The precise charges he was expected to face were not immediately clear. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment.

&&Shit. Time really is up.&&He is surrendering. I am surprised. I thought he would escape to Europe or Israel.&&“How many times do we have to teach you a lesson old man”&&I'm starting to think this weinstein fellow isn't a good dude. &&Just fucking do it already! Haul his greasy ass out of whatever fake sex addiction clinic he's holding down at and put him in real prison!&&Harvey's statement to the judge ""If you allow me house arrest with probation I can guarantee you a three picture deal and dinner with Matthew McConaughey""&&I wonder if Meryl Streep will defend him.&&>Ms. Evans said Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him during a business meeting in 2004.

Good news but how does trial works for a sexual assault happened near 15 years ago? Surely any biological proof is gone and case for any witness is weak. Ms.Evans needs some tangible proof here, like recording or something. Otherwise the arrest won't result in any conviction and man like Weinstein will immediately bail so he won't stay a day behind the bar.

This is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is an entire cabal of such molesters having their kingdom thrust into the spotlight. 

Massive busts for human trafficking all over the world. Notoriously, places these insanely wealthy sicko pedophiles like to visit, and do business with.

&&All these charges are literally he said she said. No wonder he is turning himself in. He is expecting to walk. There are no rape kits as well. None of them ever filed a report after the attack. There are a lot of cases like these. The courts throw them out or rule in favor of the rapist. As much of a prick, Weinstein is they have nothing concrete. He still has supporters in Hollywood.

What’s more luxury than an actress prostitute?&&Think about your celebrity crushes. Now imagine you are in a position to meet not just those crushes, but pretty much any and all celebrities. Now imagine that you and you alone have the ability to blackmail/coerce them into fulfilling your celebrity sex fantasies because if they don't you can end their careers. Also, it costs you no money to do any of this. 

Would you hire a prostitute if this was the case?

Not condoning his behaviour or saying I would do the same, just saying I understand it. It also helps if you imagine that you're a piece of shit who doesn't care how if he hurts other people or not, so long as he gets what he wants.&&You mean a Venus fly trap ?&&Why bring charges then?

hes a drop in the bucket, its not like hollywood is going to stop being a perverted cesspool because of one guy getting held accountable.&&There are plenty of other Weinstein in Hollywood. Don't be fooled. Young actresses in Hollywood are still doing casting couches. Remember there are other producers, studio execs and famous stars who still do this. Weinstein was just a lamb to distract from the industry problem. &&If you know anything about show business, you know Harvey is the rule, not the exception.&&Lol cause young actresses get jobs cause of their talent. Just cause they won't have Harvey to deal with, doesn't mean the next guy who's not a pig won't tell her to fuck off cause shes not as hot as the other girl that flirted with him&&Lmao. This guy is one of hundreds of dudes just like him. He just happened to be the most powerful one. Now someone else will step up and take his place.

&&Sure. Weinstein was the only one doing this.

Hollywood is good now. It's all over guys. &&Uhh ou don't think there's just some other sleezy fuckhead still doing the same thing, just laying low for now?

I can't help but feel like he was betrayed and sold out when some other ""big-wigs"" like him had a close call. 

Hel,l there's still a massive pedophile ring that seems to be mentioned but nothing ever happens with it.

Maybe it's bullshit, but it's hollywood and hollywood never ceases to disgust me. &&Assuming there aren't tons of executives like him &&Highly doubt it &&I think Hollywood is like the lottery. You probably have countless young actresses ready to make it big, but really only a handful of them will.&&I'm guessing ego or he knows he'll skate somehow.

*""Aw shucks we tried out best. Will we see you at the next fundraiser Mr. Weinstein?""* &&Everything in his life so far has taught him that he'll get away with it. One reason for staying put I can think of is that he believes, sooner or later, he'll be back on top of his empire. 

I worry that it's not just a delusion of a maniac. I worry that he has reason to believe it.&&The Manhattan D.A. has been gathering sufficient evidence against him. We still live in a country where you can't just arrest people because you feel like they should be arrested.&&Actual criminal charges/arrests in something like this, where there's general no proof, can be incredibly difficult. It's essentially like someone saying you stole their bike, but without any proof that you have the bike, or that the bike they have was ever yours to begin with.&&Yeah right, all this will do is force them into the shadows for a bit and then come back out, a few opportunitistic women will make fake claims about A-Listers and then be used as scapegoats. Get a fucking grip.&&Can you blame her? She fucks one fat dude then becomes one of the biggest movie starts around. Say what you want about Harvey, his system worked &&Cosby and Weinstein as cell mates, in ABC's newest odd couple comedy ""Goofies who Roofie!""
&&Ah, one of those country club prisons that got popular after the Enron debacle.&&Cosby had a disposition where he vaguely admitted to the crime though.


Weinstein was so systematic in his approach to rape and covering bases, that it is gonna be a hard one to prove in court.

I think this is the biggest difference between Weinstein and others, with the others it feels as if they just did it because they thought they could get away with it, it seems like Weinstein did it because he made the preparation ahead of time to get away with it. 


Almost like these other guys were murdering people in a moment of  passion, and Weinstein was a contract killer. I guess that is a bad analogy because contract killers kill for other people, but you get what I'm trying to say. Weinstein seems more like a professional criminal that just a pervy man with power, it is just his crime of choice is rape.


I do hope they have something concrete though and this is not for show.&&Is Cosby in prison?&&cosby had a mistrial first, and a long history of accusers who he locked behind nondisclosure agreements. AND he drugged them, a felony. 

Weinstein has coerced and perhaps assaulted, but its a much higher burden of proof. &&I still don’t quite understand how Cosby was found guilty considering the statute of limitations and all that. (I do believe he was absolutely guilty though.) Was it simply the overwhelming number of accusations?&&Hey, it won’t be a cake walk. He’s gunna get a lot of knee pain from all that tennis he’ll be playing.&&I think Cosby incriminated himself.

The fact that the types of prisons white collar criminals go to are much better than horrible prisons doesn't mean they are resorts. They are cleaner, have better food (not good food), less violent offenders, and cells have things like simple wooden desks and chairs. It's not cushy it's just...humane.  &&A friend of mine did 18 months for embezzlement. Went to a prison that barely had a fence around it and he worked in the bakery. No violent offenders. His first words to me when he got were, “heed my advice, Wally, you do not ever want to go to prison.”&&Hah, not when you're a billionaire.

My slightly rich sister won't even stay at a Holiday Inn.&&Have you been? 
Myself- I would not want to be forced to be someplace I don’t want to be. 
&&He's surrendering tomorrow morning. &&Wow, I'm surprised. I expected him to try to pull the old ""Ethan Couch"". &&It's not like he'll actually be going to jail yet:

>As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Harvey Weinstein will put up $1 million in cash and wear a monitoring device.

Pretty literal definition of rich privilege. &&“As well” is always two words.&&Still better than not getting a conviction. &&To be fair, they just got Cosby.&&Nah, every once in a while the lizard people choose one of their own to offer up as a sacrifice and it's usually someone they wanted to get rid of anyway.  Shkreli, Madoff, etc.  Weinstein is and has been the perfect fall guy/lightning rod to draw attention away from all the other predators in every other profession.  The people want blood and they will have it.&&It definitely matters. He will be a convicted criminal and his crimes were punished. It says a lot. &&Even if he spends just a week in prison then goes back to his swimming pool of money, he is already established as one of the symbols of the rampant sexual harrassment machine in the entertainment industry, and while it would be extremely emotionally satisfying to see his ass in jail, what society stands to gain is the former. Fewer men will feel welcome to harrass women now, fewer people will have to suffer, and hopefully the outings will continue until this whole toxic culture stops. It's a long process, but it's gotta come from somewhere.&&Yeah I don’t think so. Dude is fucked. 

I know Reddit loves to say rich people never serve time for their crimes, but ask Bill Cosby and Phil Spector how they feel about that. Spector worth many millions. Cosby worth several hundred million. Both will die in prison.

Of course money helps you buy better representation, but let’s not pretend you can just purchase a get out of jail free card somehow. &&Highly public trials don’t work that way for the rich.

Hollywood is the **ENEMY** of #metoo.  There has never been a (legal) industry in the US with such widespread and unchecked sexual abuse of women and children.  And yet, they saw fit to throw themselves a party, hosted by a man who got famous on a show about ""Juggies"" jumping on trampolines, and lecture the rest of America on how **WE** need to shape up.  And then, as you mentioned, gave an award for Kobe Bryant.

You think someone like Streep, who worked extensively and extremely closely with Harvey Weinstein for decades, was just blissfully unaware of his tendencies?  He was completely brazen about what he did.  The stuff he did to Selma Hayek took place on a set, in front of an entire crew.  Celebrities ALL know who these people are.  But they won't do anything about it, because it could harm their careers and they have no skills other than playing pretend.

Any celebrity who claims to be part of these #metoo or #timesup movements needs to either start naming names like Gal Gadot did \(my favorite woman in Hollywood\), or sit down, shut the fuck up, and admit that they are tacitly accepting and perpetuating a system that will lead to the continued sexual exploitation of \(mostly, but not exclusively\) women and children.&&I'm pretty sure the only people who consider Kobe as some sort of sexual predator are people who aren't familiar with the allegations at all. Including him with the likes of Weinstein and Polanski just diminishes what those two creeps actually did.&&The thing about Kobe was that it was alleged and the girl settled after the case presented that she seemed like an opportunist. Just because there was an accusation doesn't mean he did it. 

She may have been strong armed and intimidated into settling but we don't know any of that...but to flat out put him in the same sentence as Harvey Weinstein is sensational. &&You're right about Kobe, ignore all these people.&&That's great but it doesn't answer the actual question posed.

Everyone from producers, to the casting directors, to just someone who might have an in can take advantage of a young naive actress or actor, and spit them out when they are done.

There was an episode of 99% invisible where in the 20’s Hollywood was taking advantage of young women so much that the government stepped in and told them to stop themselves, and that’s how Central Casting came about.

So yes, people getting sexually assaulted happens all over, but it is magnified in Hollywood, which is why it needs to be made an example of.&&[deleted]&&Because he was a citizen of France already, Harvey to my knowledge is not.&&Polanski is a French citizen, and thus can not be extradited as long as he stays in France.&&Only because he’s a French citizen. &&If you make a big enough show of something even the most trivial of things will seem important.

Hollywood is not the enemy of \#MeToo. The movement and saying was literally [coined by an actress.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Milano)

Hollywood is not one person. Most of us are just blue collar workers (electricians, PA's, hairdressers) and low-level tech workers (archivists, software engineers, DIT's) and struggling artists (prop masters, makeup artists, production designers). Many of us were pushing for (and taking great professional risk for) a better, industry-wide HR system long before the MeToo movement. 

It'd be like if you were a low-level guy at some tech company pushing for industry-wide change in Silicon Valley, and your boss, somebody who got famous for her achievements at this tech company, started a movement pushing for better HR practices and systemic change in the industry, and then some jerk online was like 

>The entire idea of Silicon Valley supporting \#MeToo is a complete joke. There's a lot of sexual abuse in Silicon Valley, therefore anybody who is trying to change this industry is just throwing themselves a party to lecture us on how WE need to shape up. Do you think [your boss] who works in this industry was just blissfully unaware? You know who \#MeToo should really be holding accountable? The women. If they didn't literally turn in their boss to the police, we should assume they were accepting and profiting from sexual exploitation.

This accomplishes nothing. It's just ""Hey, look how superior I am to all these celebrities."" It does nothing to make a real industry employing real people safer. 

It also ignores vital context about sexual assault. The problem of sexual assault in Hollywood is not ""loose morals."" It isn't as simple as ""hey, if these guys just had more character they wouldn't look the other way."" It's systemic. As in, not just widespread, but there's something wrong with the system that is giving us these results. And to suggest without evidence that the people who are currently trying to make the system safer, and have done so as they suffered under an unjust system for decades, are just doing so for attention is unfair. &&This is something I brought up to my girlfriend today when discussing Morgan Freeman. Everyone in Hollywood does this shit and has been doing it. They knew it was going on and some even participated in it knowing it will advance their careers. To act like they're now all appalled is laughable to me. 

Yeah, the possibility that women came to him knowing they would advance their careers by sleeping with him doesn't excuse his sexual assault allegations, but it just shows that this behavior is common and possibly rewarded in Hollywood. People sleep their way into movies and shows a lot more often than anyone wants to admit. My girlfriend got mad and disagreed with me, probably thinks I'm a rape apologist for bringing up that fact, but it's still true as fuck.&&""Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.""&&You don't necessarily need a bucket of DNA to prove someone guilty. They've spoken to witnesses, probably attempted to corroborate stories, if there were any financial records of a hush deal, for example, or the victims having intimate personal knowledge about Weinstein they may only know by having seen him naked, recordings, friends of the accused who testified either under duress or out of sympathy or spite... Presumably, they will attempt to gather corroborating evidence that will stand up in a criminal court.&&These cases will hinge on whether the prosecution can call multiple ""unrelated"" witnesses to bolster the evidence of the named accuser. Most trials don't hinge on DNA or physical evidence, they hinge on testimony. The judge lets 40 other women in who tell a similar story? Weinstein's going to jail forever. The judge doesn't? Harvey likely walks.

Simple as that.&&There would be no case without propable cause to bring charges. The challenge is up to the ""Pay to Play""  Judicial system.

Chances are he may walk with representation, considering he sets the ""when"" he gets to be arrested already!

Maybe someone found a ""Little Black Book"" like Heidi Fleiss had.

Then, I didn't report it because I'm a guy (who was a Marine at the time) and guys don't get sexually assaulted by women, right? Now she's free to carry on and I didn't do shit about it.

Edit: This is probably why (from the New Yorker:

> Vance’s stomach for high-profile prosecution was tested early on, in the 2011 sexual-assault case against the French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who, before his arrest, was the head of the International Monetary Fund. A maid who was cleaning the Sofitel New York hotel suite where Strauss-Kahn was staying reported to police that he had emerged naked from the bathroom and forced her to perform oral sex. The D.A.’s office indicted Strauss-Kahn and trumpeted the strength of the case. But the office later disclosed credibility problems with the complaining witness. Vance reversed course and decided to dismiss all criminal charges, announcing that his office was “unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt, whatever the truth may be about the encounter.”&&A swell&&Still better than not being prosecuted.&&A small positive is that those lawyers won’t be cheap either.

Notice how they tucked their tails and ran away? It's because they know that they deserve to be slapped. No one deserves to be assaulted, but some people do deserve to be slapped.

Violence is bad. Gentle slapping to shame someone who needs to feel some shame for once is fine. In this particular instance I think the slapper was acting in the right. He didn't chase or seriously harm anyone, he was just being assertive. He *easily* could have closed his fist and put some weight behind it but he wasn't there to hurt anyone, he just wanted to shun him away and make him feel shame.

This seems like a bad system because you can't possibly use undercover cops (or stick a wire on someone involved) to figure out about crimes before they occur, or about people revealing intent to commit a crime or perhaps that they know details about a crime that had already taken place, implicating them in the crime.

In the case of Weinstein, he would get extradited to the U.S. since Israel extradites people who are not residents. It only refuses to extradite its own residents, and even in those cases Israel will try the case in its own courts.

Similar situation with France, Switzerland and Panama. It's very hard to get them to extradite their own citizens but they extradite foreigners. As Weinstein is only a citizen of the U.S., there's no where he could really flee to that would be better than serving out a U.S. prison sentence.&&Can we talk about France?

Also, if the defendant admits the conduct, it is NOT just he-said/she-said, because the defendant has admitted, e.g., agreed, with the victim.

""Just their word"" CAN be enough. To say it is not enough in the eyes of the law is, again, wrong.

Also, s/he is wrong about what countries are non-extradition. S/he is wrong about all of them in fact.

**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* **Solo: A Star Wars Story** \- Normally on a holiday weekend I wait until Tuesday so I can discuss the full scope of how the extra day off affected the major releases. But the results for Solo were so shocking I frankly couldn't wait and wanted to get at that juicy analysis asap.  tracking to open at the worst over $100M for the three\-day weekend may now not even crack $100M after a four day holiday as Solo: A Star Wars Story opened to #1 with $83.3M. It's been strange because I've seen a lot of couching for this number, that it's soft or underwhelming. Let me be more blunt then, this number right here is bad. Really, really, really bad. How bad? Well first off remember Justice League, the megaflop from last year? That film carried a similar budget of around $300M \(Solo's estimates are all over the map with Disney reporting $250M while Deadline reports $300M\+\) and was also a film that was basically shot twice under two different sets of directors. Well that film, for all its woes, opened at $93.8M, a full $10M higher than Solo. Then there's the comparisons to other Disney era Star Wars films. No one expected the spin\-offs to do as well as the episodic ones but compared with Rogue One, Solo is just pitiful. Rogue One opened 46&#37; higher than Solo with $155M and that was in December when films are supposed to be flipped from the usual summer release strategy of opening really big to cushion big drops in the coming weekends. Not to mention that Star Wars has always been much more of a domestic pull then other more lucrative international properties like the MCU and the Fast & Furious films, which brings us to the even worse news.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)** \- International was probably never going to save this film but the results are far far worse than everyone predicted as the film opened to a miserable $65M overseas, making the worldwide opening a miserable $148.8M. The film couldn't even crack the best international numbers of the weekend, as Deadpool 2 out grossed it by earning $67M on its second weekend. To put that in context Rogue One opened to $134.9M overseas and Justice League opened to $185M. In fact you can just look at[ the list of overseas openings](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/weekend/opening/) \(thanks u/Greede for showing me that list\) and see the many box office disappointments that opened better, including: The Mummy \($140.7M\), Pacific Rim Uprising \($122.4M\), Thor: The Dark World \($109.4M\), 300: Rise of An Empire \($88.8M\), Wrath of the Titans \($76.1M\), and fellow Disney megabomb alum John Carter \($70.6M\). Every Star Wars film seems to set a new low in China and this one took the cake opening there to just $10.1M \(Rogue One opened to $30M\). Guess disguising the film under the title ""Ranger Solo"" in China didn't really help with the country's continued disinterest in the franchise. As it stands not only will Solo be the only Disney era Star Wars film to not crack $1B, it could very well earn less worldwide than Rogue One made domestically \(and note it has already opened lower worldwide than Rogue One opened domestically\). That is terrible no matter what way you slice it.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-  So what the hell happened here? While the film got worse reviews then Last Jedi the fan vibe seems to be more generally positive including a solid A\- score on Cinemascore. Of course there was the very public firings of original directors, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, and the complete reshooting of the film which ballooned the budget to such catastrophic proportions. That change also meant marketing took a while to finally roll out, all while trying to compete against bigger and splashier ad campaigns like Avengers and Deadpool. Star Wars fatigue could certainly be a thing with less than six months in between the last two films and following up a very divisive film at that. The main takeaway for me though is there is no damn reason that a spin\-off movie should cost more than a main movie. Solo potentially being one of the most expensive films of all time is insane because by its very nature the work is disposable, an ad on, DLC. It should be a fun addendum, not must see material that demands the kind of massive crowd size reserved for the splashiest of releases.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-   Where Lucasfilm goes from here is going to be very interesting. There's blessedly more space between Solo and Episode IX with a full year and change. The episodes also don't feel as directly threatened. The more curious ones will be the Obi Wan movie by Stephen Daldry and the recently announced Boba Fett movie by James Mangold. The latter director in particular is well known for delivering good earning and audience beloved hit films like Logan on time and under budget which is exactly what Star Wars needs right now. Solo is arguably the biggest single character draw of the franchise and the fact the general public reacted so incredibly ambiguously to Solo should be extremely worrisome for Disney. It shows name alone will not drive sales and it already feels like the other spin\-off movies that are coming are horribly out of date before they even begin principal photography. Disney/Lucasfilm needs to take a real hard look at the future of this Star Wars cinematic universe because I don't think they ever expected to have potentially one of the biggest box office bombs of all time by just their fourth release.

* **Deadpool 2 \-** Despite the film having more room to have a softer second weekend landing with Solo underperforming, the comic book comedy film still had a rough second weekend dropping 66&#37; to come in a #2 with $42.7M. In comparison Deadpool dropped 57.4&#37; for its second and earned $56.4M domestic. This goes along with Deadpool 2's disappointing Sunday returns last weekend to suggest that there might be a growing disinterest and lack of specialness to the franchise. Still the film is about to crack $500M worldwide so not in dire straits, just odd that it doesn't seem to be having that same verve as the original. &&Time to cancel Wicket- An Ewok Story.&&Ron Howard: *""Now the story of a movie that lost everything and the one director who tried to save it. It's Solo: A Star Wars Story.""*&&Disney right now is going ""Thank god for Avengers"". &&I work at my local theater. It was surprisingly slow this weekend. All of the local high schools had graduations this weekend, which might explain some of it. But I actually went home early twice this weekend because there were too many employees standing around doing nothing, managers started sending people home. &&Solo should have cost half as much, and it should have been released in December. I would also note that several people I know were not even aware the movie was out yet. A poor effort all around from Disney. &&[deleted]&&You know a movie is making box office history in the worst way possible if the Box Office Week Thread consists just of ""Solo (cont.)""&&This could actually gross under 400 million with the awful International number. What worrying for Disney is that even markets that like SW( like the UK , Germany , France etc) have rejected the movie&&Whenever I saw a post about Solo in the last year the top comments I read were always about how people aren't interested in a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford.

So this box office result is shocking, for sure, because it's Star Wars and reddit is a bubble etc, but to me the lack of interest in that movie isn't *that* much of a surprise &&Maybe this will make Disney realize that milking Star Wars for the next 20 years isn't going to be as easy as they thought.&&I just don't get why they chose to release Solo now rather than at Christmas like the other Star Wars films. You'd have less competition and the likelihood of a bigger audience and it would be seen as the big release at Christmas. &&Unsurprising. I saw Solo when it debuted in Korea and there were less than 10 people total in the whole theater. Granted, it was a Thursday night opening and Star Wars isn't as popular in Korea but that's still terrible.


In contrast, when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy a few years ago in Korea the theater was absolutely packed and I had to get tickets for the next showing. No one had any idea who the GOTG were but the hype was palpable.


Somewhere along the line, Lucasfilm seriously dropped the ball on this film. I don't know whether it was bad marketing or bad business decisions, probably a mix of both. I don't think it's a franchise killer but they really needed some good press/will after The Last Jedi. Interested to see what they do with Star Wars from here.&&Not sure why they thought it was a good idea to make an origin story about a character that you just killed off ~2 years ago.&&Who would have thought 10 years ago that a Deadpool movie would have opened $50mil higher than a goddamn Star Wars film.&&Avengers: Infinity War won the bloodbath battle royal between Solo and Deadpool 2.

It is still a smart move from Disney/Marvel to move up a week.&&Solo bombed first! &&So even with the Monday, there's a chance it still won't be 100$m+ over the four days.

That's...rather surreal, honestly.

People have already outlined why it failed, I won't be a broken record.

Instead, I'll express surprise that Greatest Showman and Jumanji are apparently still in theaters. Also, apparently Hurricane Heist is too. It's been hanging onto those 8 theaters for a while now.

EDIT: Guys there are a lot of replies to this; No harshness intended, but think if you're really saying anything new when you reply. &&I was completely shocked when I walked into the theater at a late night showing Friday and found it less than 1/4 full.

I mean, even Overboard had a bigger crowd opening night in my area.

When I bought the ticket at noon, I had booked a seat right next to an existing reservation.  I thought I was being considerate by not leaving a one-seat gap.  I ended up feeling like I had chosen the urinal right next to someone else in an otherwise empty bathroom.
&&Shit is weird. I am an insane die-hard Star Wars fan (I even play Fantasy Flight's SWRPG every Saturday with my mates) and I pretty much love all Star Wars movies but you can put me in the camp that was not too in love with Last Jedi and think it had a host of issues.

But damn did I ever enjoy SOLO. It was way better than anything I expected. From the trailers I said to myself I was in for Chewie, Lando, and for interior sequences inside the Millennium but I ended up liking Alden's performance as SOLO and thought the plot was way more enjoyable than Last Jedi even though you shouldn't really compare them.

I hope the movie gets more love with time... &&Too many, too fast. Cheapens them all. &&In other news, has anyone noticed how small was the drop on Book Club? I smell a sleeper hit.&&I honestly enjoyed Solo a lot, but I do think it’s good that it’s performing poorly. It should teach Lucasfilm that they cannot treat Star Wars like Marvel where they churn out one movie or more every year. Marvel stories at least have the comic books to go off of, but Star Wars requires more time in the studio brainstorming since it’s completely off the bat. 

That said, if you’re on the fence about watching, I would say you would enjoy the movie a lot if you hated The Last Jedi and just want to see Star Wars have fun again. &&Should remember that Disney themselves said they expected this movie to flop back in January. I remember reading about it on here so it's no big surprise to them.  


After TLJ had such a polarizing effect on the fandom and the Solo movie's existence already showing flaws with the idea of the anthology movies as it doesn't really connect any meaningful dots that segway into anything you would care about in the OT which no one was excited for this was destined to happen. Hopefully this makes Disney reconsider what they're doing with the Star Wars franchise.  


I'm sure with Black Panther's surprise success \(we all knew it'd do well but not ""third highest domestic grossing ever"" well\) and Infinity War on it's way to making 2 billion Disney will be alright this summer especially with megahits like Incredibles 2 on the way but if this means Disney will realize the MCU formula doesn't work with Star Wars then I have no complaints over this.&&Solo was a movie almost NO ONE wanted. They should stay away from the source movies and just make a brand new movie in the star wars universe. Otherwise, give the fans what they want (A Ewan led Obi Wan movie)&&I'm kinda glad Solo didn't perform. I don't want origin stories for all the characters we already know, I want Disney to move the franchise forward, not backwards (unless it's very far in the past... KotoR, maybe?) and I hope (a little) that this may convicne them to take a new direction. But the comments seem to indicate that it's at least enjoyable, so I'll catch it when it's on TV or streaming or something. &&Just my two cents...more people are “wait and see” now on Star Wars because of the Last Jedi. Same thing happened with BvS vs JL. The predecessor did what it was supposed to do but left a bad taste in everyone mouths.

Also for me personally, the guy playing Han wasn’t Han enough. I still saw the movie though.&&All things considered, Ron Howard did a fairly good job delivering on the product. It’s a shame that the brunt of the blame will fall on him, I wouldn’t mind seeing him handling a future film with him having control from the get go. He’s also been a good sport handling the damage control, taking it on the chin. &&I have seen every Star Wars movie in the theater since 1977.   I have no interest in seeing Solo.   The Last Jedi was so bad that I am done with Star Wars.   The funny thing is, one of my best friends, who is a true Star Wars fan, thinks Solo is the 4th best Star Wars movie ever.  He hated the prequels and the last three films quite a bit.   Him giving Solo a positive review is making me rethink my one man Star Wars boycott.&&This box office wasn't shocking to anyone paying any attention to Star Wars fans. The Last Jedi was reviled. Fans were livid. No one asked for this. It seemed like a complete cash in with no purpose and I think that one two punch killed this film. Disney should have waited a year for people to forget about how much they hated The Last Jedi, but even then Star Wars fans have prequel PTSD and they also have Disney PTSD after *The Last Jedi* basically have the middle finger to Star Wars. &&That's a fucking rough opening. Though oddly if they announced a sequel today I'd be more excited for Solo 2 than for episode IX. &&To be honest I saw incredibly little advertising for Solo. I think that played a large role in the poor opening weekend. &&The last jedi kinda burned me. &&I think Star Wars is actually a tainted name now.

Regardless of the actual quality of Solo, there just isn't enough baseline interest in this universe any more.

I think Disney (and most studios) haven't learned the true power of word-of-mouth in the age of social media.  It used to be that TV spots and billboards that generated interest.  Nowadays those barely matter.  It's about how many people repost/share something to their friends.  Both good and bad news.

The real problem is pissing off the old fans.  Sure, it's a ""new Star Wars for a new generation"" but guess what?  Who's the new generation going to turn to when the want to know if they should watch a movie?  Not a billboard or a TV commercial.  It's their friends on Facebook.

TLJ pissed off too many of the old fans, and that was enough to generate negative hype so that the new generation isn't interested any more.&&I think more than the release date and competition, what's affecting Solo is the fact that they're continuing to rely on nostalgia rather than go in a new direction with the franchise. I feel like at this point they're not adding to the fan base and only losing fans especially with the lukewarm response TLJ got.&&[deleted]&&I don't hate Disney.   I HATED TLJ.  I loved Solo.  

I think what I blame is Disney's management of the new trilogy.  They ruined Luke.  Snoke was useless.  The First Order make no sense and are run by a bunch of whiny children that could not rule a sandbox much least run the galaxy.  Space Leia.  I don't care for any of the new characters except Rey.  I like the concept of Finn, hate the execution.  Don't get me started on Kylo.  The plot for TLJ makes no fucking sense -- 16 hours to leave a ship, fly to some other planet, get arrested, stage a breakout, flee on a ship, sneak past the FO defenses, board the ship, hack the ship -- Please that makes no sense.    They need to narrow the main cast and follow them, not 5 different storylines that they superficially cover.  

What has killed Solo's numbers is the new trilogy and the management of it. &&The Last Jedi made me have no interest in the rest of the series anymore&&The last jedi really fucked the franchise. &&I’m really curious to see how Disney takes this. There’s so many things they could blame, from the quality of the movie (eh, probably not, far worse movies mad more money), the marketing, the production, Kathleen Kennedy. I think it’s really two things: it released in an incredibly packed month, and nobody was particularly interested in this movie. 

For the first, we all know that ticket prices at the movies have continued to rise in theaters in the US especially, and in such a packed month of movies, I can definitely see people picking and choosing what they want to see more carefully. And for a lot of people, Solo just isn’t that interesting. Honestly, when has a prequel not tied to an existing story (i.e. the Hobbit) ever actually done that well? Everyone already sort of knows how it ends, and having a different actor than Harrison Ford might have turned off a few people as well. On top of that, it looked like just another Star Wars movie in the vein of all the other ones. Rogue One had some interesting war movie vibes, but Solo just looks the same as all the others. Compare that to the Marvel movies, where every single one has a new hook and a new genre, and I’m not surprised that people might be so meh about this.&&I wouldn't blame fatigue. As MCU has proven, if done right more movies are welcome. I think it is the mistreatment of fans, the transparent money grab approach, forced politics, and the dislike of Kathleen Kennedy's/Rian Johnson's arrogance. All hype has vanished for me after the mismanagement of some the greatest fictional characters in film, now they are fodder. They ran the IP into the ground because they didn't respect it but rather used it as a means for their own agenda.&&I enjoyed Solo more than The Last Jedi.

That is all.&&There's just so many factors working against this film (many of them self-inflicted by Disney):

* Obvious cash grab

* Nobody asked for it

* Negative fan reaction to TLJ

* Widely known production issues

* Star Wars fatigue in general, particularly it's barely been any time since TLJ

I love Star Wars, I really do. But I had absolutely no interest in seeing this film. It just seemed like a pointless addition to the series that Disney pursued because they thought they could cruise on Star War's name recognition and Solo's likability as a character. 

I hope this whole debacle causes Disney to rethink their films going forward. Looking at the films they've currently announced, I'm not hopeful.&&Why do people want watch a character who we have already seen evolve into a hero and be killed by his own son? Disney should move far far far far and even some more far away in the universe and tell us new original stories with fresh characters and conflicts. What am I going to tell my children about star wars? That's is they were based on younger version of older characters who appeared in movies during my dads era?&&**Good!** The only thing that speaks to Disney is money. Maybe a flop or two will make them realize that they need to make good Star Wars films and not soulless, agenda-laden sci-fi that is Star Wars in name only. 

&nbsp;

They need to cherry-pick certain keepers of the old EU to keep the franchise internally consistent. Maybe a few of the better writers as well. (Timothy Zahn anyone?) And again, we don't need modern politics depicted in our space fantasy, it just ruins immersion.&&I haven't bothered watching it yet since the disaster that was The Last Jedi killed my hype for Star Wars. Until that movie I always watched them within the first few days, but now I just can't be bothered. I'll probably watch it some time next week.&&Hate to say it but as a life long Star Wars fan TLJ left such a shitty taste in my mouth. I have no yen to continue opening weekend viewings.  

Star Wars movies have officially be moved to my wait for DVD release movie section.  This saddens me.&&This is all TLJ 's fault. I really enjoyed Solo.&&So Disney killed the franchise in a mere 3 years.  Pretty impressive.&&Rian Johnson has poisoned the well. Let this serve as a warning for his “new, expectation subverting, fresh, original” trilogy. &&After TLJ  I am less inclined to watch any more Star Wars films.  I didn't want a solo movie and I sure as heck don't want a boba fett movie either.  

I would like to see films that mine from the old Dark Horse  comics about the sith and early Jedi.  I'm just over the trilogy characters. &&They need to fire Kathleen Kennedy and hire someone that gets Star Wars, understands what it means to the fans, and with every creative decision has respect for what has come before. Given his track record with clone wars and rebels, only one man that has the vision to take the job.

Dave Filoni you are our only hope! &&Can we fire Kathleen Kennedy yet? She's boat anchoring the entire franchise.&&I guess China really has stopped US soy imports.&&The indifference towards Solo has been brutal, the movie was fine enough.


Disney haven't exactly made bad SW movies till now ,but its clear TLJ did put off a significant section of the fanbase.
&&i blame it on the last jedi... 

had that been a really good movie the momentum would have carried over to Solo&&I'm telling you, Disney is going to water down the Star Wars franchise into oblivion &&Some of us didn't go because we're still pissed about what they did with TLJ.&&I don't know what other people in my demographic are up to (I'm 46), but I've changed my Star Wars viewing habits in the last few years. Even with the I-II-III prequels, I was excited enough to go see them multiple times in theaters. I think I saw III three times in first run, then once or maybe twice in the $5 theater.

I was excited again for TFA and saw it twice at full price (IMAX 3D), and once in regular 3D. 

But since then, for whatever reason, I feel like I need to see the new movies once in regular 3D and that's it. Maybe it's the frequency, and I don't want to budget $300/yr for Star Wars movies? Or maybe they're just ""good enough"" and I kinda have to see them at least once so I can still follow the story? I dunno. From talking to friends I think this is a common attitude in my age group.

And without their Gen X parents taking them, I don't know how much young people care about these movies. They already spend a ton on the 4-6 superhero movies coming out each year.&&Haven't scene it yet but I would bet it's still better than The Last Jedi. &&Two main reasons:

1) Whether you loved or hated TLJ, I think it is fair to say that it was divisive and alienated a lot of the old fans. It was probably the final nail in the coffin for many of the fans who grew up with the OT and books. It was very intentionally a departure from the traditional tone of the movies, and just felt wrong to the old fans.

2) No one was asking for a Solo origin story, especially when there are so many other tales that could be told.

That said, I actually saw Solo and really enjoyed it. It had the right tone for a SW movie, the humor wasn't forced, the effects were great, and there were plenty of nods to the old fans. It's a shame that it's going to tank, because this is a really fun movie that I think fits perfectly within the SW universe.

Side note: the pansexual stuff is getting completely overblown&&I’m excited for Solo myself, but TLJ killed the Star Wars hype honestly&&It's because of the backlash of TLJ. Star Wars will never be the same again because of how badly they've treated their characters. There's nothing to relate it to the old films, so the nostalgia is gone, the money is gone. They screwed up all of their ""deaths"".&&At this point why would you allow Rian to make his trilogy. That man has done irreversible damage to the Star Wars brand. &&After TLJ I'm not watching the garbage they release as star Wars anymore&&I lost faith in Disney after the last jedi. Caused me to not see Solo.&&It was way better the the last jedi. &&[deleted]&&The Disney star wars movies have been lackluster from the start. The first in the new trilogy got a pass because while it was the same story as a new hope, it was better than the prequels. But the last Jedi was god awful. Really the only good new one is rogue one, 1 out of 4 isn't a great success rate.&&After the disaster that was TLJ, I and most other Star Wars fans I know are for the first time ever not going to see a star wars movie opening weekend but going to wait to read reviews and see how it pans out. 

By contrast, I saw both TFA and Rogue one twice, on opening weekend, and loved both movies. Rogue One is easily one of the three best star wars movies. Saw TLJ once, and was appalled. Solo - zero times. 

TLJ is plodding nonsensical trash, with wooden static characters and an insane numbers of plot holes and more disrespect for the source material than any other Star Wars movie aside from ""Midichlorians"". 

It's disappointing to me that so much genuine criticism of a terrible movie was handwaved away as ""Oh, it's just people who can't handle strong female leads"". This is nonsense of course, as both TFA and Rogue One had strong female leads, were good movies, and performed very well. But the fact that they couldn't take any criticism about their movie really made me worried about the direction of the franchise. 

Saw Infinity War, loved it, am going to see Deadpool 2, so there isn't much room for rolling the dice on another Star Wars movie that might just spend is time ripping up established canon. 

With weaker competition I might be more inclined to see it, who knows. &&Disney predicted Silo to open twice as high as it did worldwide. I think that's just hilarious. It would be like if they predicted 1.2 billion opening for Infinity War&&I won't pay to see a Disney Star Wars movie after The Last Jedi, happy to see Solo bomb. &&this is backlash from the last jedi being a horrific piece of garbage.  The people that actually like star wars will not abide this new direction of pure dog shit.  all these theories in here trying to explain it away as star wars fatigue and other bullshit are completely blind to reality.&&Take this how you will. I’ve lined up opening night to see all the prequels and both new ones. TLJ turned me off so much I’m just done. &&I will raise my hand and say that I'm one of the many, it seems, who saw another film this weekend (Deadpool 2) instead of Solo. I was appalled at The Last Jedi and it'll take a lot to pull me back into Disney's version of Star Wars.&&I can only speak for myself, but I have refused to support Disney's Star Wars ever since they released the cinematic abomination known as ""The Last Jedi"".&&I'm seeing what appears to be a coordinated effort to sell Solo's failure as ""Star Wars fatigue"" and I'm simply not buying it.  Moviegoers have a proven track record of going to see multiple films per year in a franchise when those films themselves have a proven track record of being quality material (see: Disney's actually successful Marvel franchise).  Nobody outside of us dedicated comic nerds knew who Black Panther was and that film is *still* selling tickets even after Infinity War because its a well-done movie and it follows a handful of previously well-done movies.  Meanwhile, Disney couldn't get people to buy tickets to see motherflippin' **Han Solo**, one of the most popular movie characters ever, from ""movie fatigue""?

No, Solo has failed because of two reasons:

1) the past two Star Wars franchise movies were mediocre, with the last Star Wars movie being particularly awful.  People are still feeling burned from their last SW experience.

2) Both the trailers and the early reviews for Solo were uninspiring.  The movie could have possibly risen above The Last Jedi poisoning the well if the trailers had blown us away but there wasn't amazing, nothing must-see, to make us run out and buy tickets to get that TLJ taste out of our mouths.

Don't buy the ""fatigue"" spin.  Its BS and we all know it.  Its Disney execs knowing that heads are getting ready to roll over the Solo failure trying to displace the blame from making a crappy movie back onto the moviegoing audience, its not their fault the movie stinks up the theaters, its *our* fault for being fatigued with the franchise.  Don't accept this, folks, we don't owe Disney free money, if they want us to buy tickets they gotta make a compelling product.  Make a movie with even mediocre appeal and Star Wars fans will go see it, Disney couldn't even manage mediocrity here.

Looking forward to seeing who gets the axe here but more importantly who steps up to right this franchise ship.&&Kevin Feige, who runs the MCU, is a Marvel fan. He knows the source material, he knows the Marvel fans, and has delivered a staggering $16B so far for Disney.

While on the Star Wars front Disney have Kathleen Kennedy at the helm: https://i.redd.it/6aw3vw8uep501.jpg

Star Wars has made a ton of money with the first two movies because it's freakin' Star Wars, but the fan disservice coming from the top is starting to bleed into the box office, finally.

Solo is... like, imagine an Indiana Jones movie without Harrison Ford as Indy. No disrespect to Alden Ehrenreich, he did a great job on the movie, but nobody will care about it without Harrison Ford playing Indy. How can you make a $300m movie and ignoring that fact?

And if Kevin Feige and co. can take B and C list heroes like the Guardians and Black Pather and turn them into smash hits, why can't Star Wars explore some other stories that are already lying around?

Imagine a Star Wars story with the Old Republic setting, with characters like Revan, Bastila Shan or Kreia in it. Star Wars fans will literally throw money at Disney for those movies and they will market the movie for Disney by word of mouth alone. 

But no, let's make Han and Boba Fett movies who no one cares about. 4 movies into the new franchise and we still haven't seen half a decent lightsaber duel. 4 movies into the franchise and still the best and most exciting scene has been Vader turning his lightsaber on and fcking shit up.

How can you buy a franchise for $4B and not understand who your fanbase is and what they want?&&Are we not going to acknowledge that the core fanbase of starwars, great distaste for the Cathrine kennedy the new Big Boss of Lucas arts. The new starwars films are not starwars films, and the directors writes and top of lucas art goes out of their way to shit on fans, so i am really happy to see that boycot of the movie is so visible! and heres hoping disney get some new leadership in on this once beloved franchise &&TLJ killed Star Wars for me and many others.   I will never go and see another SW film&&The recent star wars movies have been so amazingly mediocre I'm just going to start ignoring them.&&This is what happens when you don't make an Obi Wan movie starring Ewan McGregor&&I kept hearing all this stuff about how many pre-sale tickets they sold and how it was ""double black panthers""

Then some people starting posting some images of assigned seating...and large swathes of the theatre was still available...a day before release. Lines up with my experience of attending the first showing and their being *maybe* ten people in the theatre and zero people lines up afterwards for the next showing. 

Kevin Feige is clearly a massive fan of marvel comics. It comes across in the movies and his interviews. Can the same be said of Kathleen Kennedy? Because it sort of feels like she's doesn't actually care for the star wars legacy and what is *was*. She wants it to be something different and a lot of fans are reacting badly to this. Last Jedi was a big drop, now this is pretty much a disaster on every level. I think Kathleen Kennedy might get called in for a not so pleasant exchange of thoughts and ideas with Bob Iger after this weekend. 

&&[deleted]&&> So what the hell happened here?

Remember when Rian Johnson tried to deflect criticism over how bad The Last Jedi was by calling every detractor out there a misogynist and/or racist?  He was wrong.  The Last Jedi sucked.  It shit all over the characters the fans have loved for decades, and many people have lost interest in Star Wars because of it, myself included.  After that fiasco last December I decided Solo would be the first Star Wars movie I will never see, because Disney had already begun shitting the bed with regards to story lines and casting.  I don't need to see the slow motion train wreck destruction of a series of films I loved from my youth by an out-of-control corporation that only sees dollar signs.  

Here's an analogy: are you a Superman fan?  Remember how bad Man of Steel and especially Batman vs. Superman completely misunderstood Superman and had him do and say things Superman never would?  Yeah, it's the same with everybody involved with Star Wars now.  It's gotten so bad it has made me rethink my position on Rogue One and The Force Awakens, and realize they weren't much better, and that it was my excitement over getting new Star Wars movies that gave them a free pass that they really didn't deserve.  For me, Star Wars ended in 1983 when Luke burned Vader's body.&&The numbers are bad because the Last Jedi was fucking awful&&Too late. We've already had Caravan of Courage and Battle for Endor.&&""Fateful Consequences""&&To be fair, I don't think anybody is blaming Ron Howard for anything here.&&At least he gets to rebound tomorrow when Season 5 drops. &&At this point Avengers 4 is all profit by the looks of it. Looking like Infinity War easily covered the 750-800m budget the 2 movies shared plus any marketing. &&Marvel in general. They made mint with Black Panther too. &&If we can't make bank with Star Wars, then we'll sure well Avenge it.&&Yeah, my area has a lot of stuff going on this weekend, and most people aren't headed to a theater.  I already saw my movie for this weekend, Deadpool.  &&Same, I work as a manager at my local theater and we're playing Solo in two of the three screens we have because the owner expected it to be busy.

Yeah....it's been slow lol. Deadpool is getting more people here than Solo.&&Same. Headed home early now too!&&When I watched it (on the largest screen in my area), there were only about a dozen people in the entire theatre. I was shocked. Such a shame too, because it's my favourite of all the recent Star Wars movies.&&Marketing was fucking awful for this movie. I remember a few months ago we still didn't even have a trailer.&&>Solo should have cost half as much

It did. Until it didn't. When they decided to scrap 75% of the movie and basically start over with a new director. 

I'm actually super curious how a L&M cut of Solo would have done at the box office now. &&It only cost as much as it did because 90% of the film was reshot.&&The only thing I love more than Star Wars is Marvel. I totally forgot Solo was out - I was planning on seeing either Deadpool 2 again or IW for the fourth time. I was like ""oh SHIT, Solo is out!?""

When your hardcore fans who were willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt (and man, was that benefit rewarded!) forget the date, you done fucked up.&&I’ll just say it. It failed because we didn’t love solo we loved Harrison Ford. &&I'm in Germany. The theaters have posters up but I haven't heard anyone mention the movie. It's not as common to go here so the young people I know are still trying to get to Deadpool.&&I literally didn't know it had even opened here in the UK. Although even if I did I went to go see Deadpool this weekend anyway.&&I was okay with the idea. I thought it coulda been great.

The fact Disney didn't think so (0 promotional material until the 2 month mark or something ridiculously close like that, dropping it RIGHT after Infinity War instead of during Christmas like other Star Wars films, 0 information about the damn thing the entire time it was announced) is what made me not interested.

Maybe if they actually advertised the fucking thing I would have actually went and seen it.

Plus now there's a boycott on the film for other reasons, it's easy to say Disney fucked up.

I sincerely think a later release date and more promotional material (remember how long it took us to get a fucking poster?) and they coulda saved it.

But that's just what I think. Maybe Memorial weekend really isn't a great week for movies, like some other people said.

Maybe it was the boycotts.

Maybe it was Harrison Ford not being part of the project.

Who knows.&&I'm really bored of Star Wars, the Last Jedi was mediocre and that put me off wanting to see any more any time soon.&&> Whenever I saw a post about Solo in the last year the top comments I read were always about how people aren't interested in a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford.

No fucking shit.

Is there some special Hollywood accounting trick being used here to justify this movie? Because I could have told you just from the barest of facts about this film it was going to flop and I'm not some goddamn movie expert. Han Solo movie sans Harrison Ford, about a character that people don't want to know the backstory on. People like Han because we don't know his whole story. *It's part of the allure*. This whole going back and explaining everything is so silly. &&I literally had next to no interest in seeing this movie; I saw it Friday solely due to brand loyalty. I love Star Wars. I liked Last Jedi. But I just had no interest in seeing a Han Solo stand alone film.

That said, I came out of the theater happy, even possibly excited at the thought of what could come next after THAT character shows up. I went in expecting a dumpster fire, after hearing 9 months worth of production woes leading up to this, but the end product was surprisingly coherent and fun to watch. The tone of the film even felt more ""Star Wars"" to me than Last Jedi. So I guess it's kind of a shame the film is doing so poorly even though, in my eyes, it's worth the price of admission. But I can definitely understand why it's happening.

Edit:a word
&&They're gonna try anyway.  Hyuck!&&Make episode 9. Name it ""We're totally not making another trilogy"". Wait 5-10 years, make a new trilogy a pre-prequel about quigon-jin and a young [jar jar binks](#spoiler)&&Can't treat star wars as comic book films. They should be epic event films on a massive scale. Can't just release them one after the other. I don't think Disney realizes this or is even capable of letting it happen. 

Hell, even the prequels felt like event films and felt epic in scale, they just got brought down by bad writing.

I hate to say it, but I think the best thing that could've happened to Star wars wouldve been Lucas taking up the mantle again. Maybe he wouldve learned from his prequel mistakes and made something worthy of being Star Wars instead of these  generic Disney sci-fi films we've gotten. &&Some people say that memorial weekend is kinda a dumping ground for Disney to release the movie that they predicted it would fail financially.

Some examples like Solo, Alice in the Wonderland 2, and Tomorrowland.&&I thought that was when Boba Fett: A Christmas carol was out.&&Plus you had to reshoot the whole movie anyways, there was no reason not to delay this movie.&&[deleted]&&Agreed. I think it was a terrible idea to release it in the wake of IW and DP2. A December release would have put it up against Aquaman, Mary Poppins, Fantastic Beast 2? 

&&Absolutely, I can't speak for everyone but I only have so much money to spend on movies. I chose IW and DP2. If Solo was release around christmas time I likely would have gone to it.&&The original Star Wars release cycle was May. Solo actually came out on the anniversary weekend of the first film a New Hope. The original plan was to have Episodes 7 to 9 be May releases as well but 7 got pushed back 6 months to December so now it’s on that cycle. &&December is pretty loaded this year and I think they have more hope for Mary Poppins Returns&&Agreed. Overcrowding/poor scheduling was a HUGE problem.

>“We never got close to selling out our big houses or our little houses on Solo. The poor spacing of the tentpoles just adds to it under performing.  **The moviegoer is on a budget: They just spent money to go to Avengers then two weeks later Deadpool 2, now a week later a lot of moviegoers are out of money by the time Solo comes out.”**

Deadpool 2 failing to top the original's opening weekend despite increased awareness (most people had no idea who Deadpool was in 2016) and another hugely successful marketing campaign should have been a massive red flag for Solo. &&My thoughts exactly. I actually enjoyed Solo a lot, but we've already seen how Han's story ends. Any interest I had in his back story pretty much died the second JP from Grandma's Boy killed him off. &&You know, I hadn't even realized that was part of why I wasn't too excited for this one to drop.&&Who would gave thought 10 years ago there would have even been another star wars film &&Or that 2 of the last 3 Star trek movies would gross more, WW total.  (this assumes Solo finishes at the low $400M range, which seems likely).&&Hey now, we reserve the phrase ""who would have thought that 10 years ago"" for *Black Panther* box office statistics only!&&Let's be honest, there was only ever going to be one winner in that battle.&&The Verge (amongst others) wrote that moving *Avengers: Infinity War* earlier to April 27th was to potentially give a bigger buffer between that one and *Solo*. And I guess it was a smart move, because *Solo*'s numbers might've been even smaller with *Infinity War* closer.

I remember in early January practically every thread here was saying that *Solo* would be moved to June, July or August, or pushed back even further down to December. Yet, they kept firm with the May release. 

And then the teaser came and didn't win the audience. (It's not even in the [most viewed trailer in 24 hours list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_viewed_online_trailers_in_the_first_24_hours)). So it got a little better by having *Infinity War* a little further away, but still, there's so much else at play that didn't work marketing wise. (It's a shame. I liked the movie and admire Howard for stitching up a mess). Marketing wise you had:

- Production issues (Lord & Miller fired, reshooting with Ron Howard)
- Not enough star power in the main lead. The marketing hook is more in the brand name and iconic Millenium Falcon, Chewbacca, Lando. (Even though Emilia Clarke and Donald Glover certainly could help to gain audience through their star power, even though they are not the main lead).
- No marketing until after *The Last Jedi* has played out. I guess I can see why they did it, but I am not sure if it turned out great.
- The teaser/trailer didn't wow and a lot of the criticism was geared around Alden not sounding like Harrison Ford. (Which isn't, in my opinion, any problem in the movie. This was Alden's portrayal of Han Solo. Not Alden's portrayal of Harrison Ford. My problems with the movie had nothing to do with Han Solo actually).
- Movie poster was plagiarized
- Bad date for the premiere weekend. Probably not realizing how much *Deadpool 2* would draw as an audience.

^EDIT: ^Edited ^star ^power ^bullet ^point
&&I don't think Infinity War was ever really part of the battle tbh. It was pretty much on it's own playing field. I've never seen a movie that was such a guaranteed success.&&https://imgur.com/hYL8S1W.jpg&&The Greatest Showman will never leave theaters.

One day you will wake up and suddenly realise that the movie has outgrossed Avatar.&&> Instead, I'll express surprise that Greatest Showman and Jumanji are apparently still in theaters

Really?! Isn't Jumanji on DVD now? Those movies have been out for months.&&Last week I was looking at what was playing in my area and Jumanji was *sold out*. And this is like six months after it came out. Obviously the movie isn't still doing *that* well everywhere but I was still shocked.&&The greatest showman has astounded me by how much endurance that film seems to have. &&You know you can just get up and change seats in that scenario right&&For me I think this movie isn't doing well because I didn't even know it was out. I saw almost no advertisements or marketing for it, aside from shitty crossover ads with other products. Those ads are such a bad way to advertise too as I get almost no info about the film including a release date, yet somehow it is relevant to them to advertise Han Solo with Swatch or whatever irrelevant brand to star wars. Dumb&&That's funny because I feel like they're trying to follow their MCU model with Star Wars but with their movies, it hasn't felt like too many, too fast. In fact, we're getting 3 MCU movies over the course of 6 months.&&Or they aren't that great. The last Star Wars movie clearly turned some people off and this one was already getting negative reactions from the moment it was announced and even more after the trailer

People don't get tired of good movies&&I could watch a new movie every month if they were as good as the OT. I think most of the issues are related to the general lack of quality in the new movies.&&I went to the bathroom when that movie had just gotten out and it looked like an AARP meeting. The same audience that flocked to Murder on The Orient Express last year are seeing Book Club en mass.&&It hit that lucrative mom demographic.

Why are moms and older women so poorly represented in terms of audience demographics?&&Well Star Wars had hundreds of books to use but decided to not go that route. &&What's frustrating is that there is a mountain of lore and stories to be told from the Old Republic storylines, and they weren't used. There's tons of stories for them to fall back on. And those are stories dating +20 years in the form of Star Wars comics, video games, and novels; all of which have been greatly embraced and loved by the fanbase. Those are the stories the fans really want told in movie form. The only thing I can think of as to why Disney chose not to utilize them is because there may be licensing issues between them and EA and BioWare or something weird. I'm not really sure. It's just odd to me they chose not to take a shot at the Old Republic storylines.&&Totally agree. Solo is everything the Last Jedi wasn’t, in the best possible way. &&I do think this one is unique, though. There was so much to deflate people’s interest. I had zero expectation for the movie and walked away thinking it was within the top half for Star Wars movies &&> Solo movie's existence already showing flaws with the idea of the anthology movies as it doesn't really connect any meaningful dots that segway into anything you would care about in the OT

This is one of the things I liked about Solo *the most*.

Star Wars needs to stop trying to connect dots, and just make good movies.
&&Seriously, Solo was one of the last characters people were crying out for. Obi-Wan Ewan McGregor movie has been top of the list for years but Boba Fett (is happening I hear?), Vader, Yoda, Maul, and countless others all have been asked for... 

Why the fuck they went with Solo I don't know.

Personally I've wanted them to go for an Old Republic story for years&&[deleted]&&i would kill for a kotor era movie&&I'm very ambivalent. I agree that Disney should move away from existing character spinoffs, but the movie itself was EXACTLY what a Star Wars movie should be. It was an old school, pulpy adventure with heart, humor and romance but with modern action and effects.

I'd love for Disney/Lucasfilm to make more movies like Solo...but with new characters too.&&Welcome to the pain of long time Star Trek fans.  While both trek, and Star Wars have virtually unlimited plot possibilities, great fan bases, etc these rehashes of the same characters with new young actors is demoralizing.  Are they that petrified of telling new stories?  Harrison Ford is killed off two movies ago so it's time to recast Han Solo already versus so many other fantastic stories that could be told?&&Absolutely. I had planned to wait to see Solo, as TLJ left a bad taste in my mouth too. Honestly don't really care what happens in IX. I changed my mind and went with my son on Friday to a matinee,  which was $10 for two tickets. Near empty theater. I went because the price was right, was really surprised by how empty the place was. Mark Hamill warned of SW fatigue,  but again,  no one listened to what he said. The movie was decent, better than TLJ. I had trouble keeping track of what planet they were on and when, also too much happening in the train heist scene (but movies are just like that these days,  it takes away from any feasible realism, don't like it... the original SW trilogy was good because the action scenes weren't complete unrealistic bullshit). The interesting new characters were killed off, but you didn't really care as long as Chewie and Han were ok, and you knew they would be. &&The “wait and see” thought process and the reason I am in that mode right now is on point. The last Jedi is why I will no longer go see Star Wars movies blindly. I will wait a couple of weeks and see how the ratings are, and if they are good I will go see it.&&I don’t think anyone will blame Howard. He came in and basically had to reshoot an entire film in a short amount of time, and the general opinion on what he created is positive. What damned Solo was outside factors (backlash from The Last Jedi, nobody caring about an origin story for this character, going up against Infinity War and Deadpool 2, etc).&&I don't think anyone is going to blame Howard. He's a veteran director at this point, came in on a super short notice and delivered the movie on time, dude is a solid working man director and this won't hurt his career one bit. Basically he's the kind of director who should be making these movies (the movie would've been a lot better if they just hired him from day one and let him prep properly). The blame is 100% on the producers. They hired Lord & Miller, knew what type of filmmakers they are. They prepped the movie for months and had they seen something they don't like they should've fired the directors during pre-production. Then they shot the movie they all agreed Lord & Miller would make and Kathleen Kennedy decides she doesn't like it anymore and fires them. It's just straight up unprofessional producing work. They should have never hired Lord and Miller to begin with&&[deleted]&&I didn't even know it was releasing this weekend until I went to see Deadpool 2 and saw the tickets listed. I thought it was coming out next month or something.&&I'm in the UK. Saw this post and thought ""wait, this movie is out?"". I've seen next to no advertising for it.&&Yeah Disney SW movies have been nothing but nostalgia bs&&They gonna run it into the ground just like when we had a new call of duty game every 6 months&&You’re not the only one.  I’m STILL in shock at that movie. I just can’t believe people signed off on it and actually allowed to come into existence.  &&Agreed. That movie killed all hope I had after VII.&&[deleted]&&[Justice League passes the torch on to Solo ](https://i.imgur.com/TZszJgB.jpg)&&> Compare that to the Marvel movies, where every single one has a new hook and a new genre

I think this is an overstated point, though I do agree that Solo was harmed by an overall ""meh"" appearance&&[deleted]&&Same haha&&Your response regarding TLJ and millions of other Star Wars fans out there is the exact reason for Solo's numbers. I can't say I blame you.&&Kathleen Kennedy did it, not Mickey Mouse&&You telling me you don’t want a movie that explains how Greedo went from being a young underprivileged green alien to the semi-competent goon that eventually got shot dead in the Mos Eisley cantina? 



There was a time when George Lucas could have put out a 90-minute movie that was just a single shot of Han Solo bring frozen in carbonite with a John Williams score and people would have lined up to see it. Those days appear to be over. &&Johnson pissed off too many fans with TLJ. This wasn't something Reddit specific. People were furious all over social media, forums, film communities, 4chan... He took a shit on everything fans loved about Star Wars and not only that, he made a bad movie generally Star Wars or not.&&I actively questioned my love for Star Wars while watching TLJ. That's not a good mood to trigger in an audience. Even the worst MCU films are still fun or enjoyable. I can't remember much about Thor 2, but I had fun watching it.   
TLJ was just a slog that I'd love to give a second chance, I just can't bring myself to even attempt it.&&[deleted]&&Yep. TLJ killed Star Wars for me.&&But TLJ fans told me only a minority hated it!! lol&&[deleted]&&I suspect this is a much bigger cause here than most people realize.&&Ending that arrangement would be a good step towards mending the damage done with the fanbase. &&> Disney predicted Silo to open twice as high as it did worldwide.


*Twice the pride, double the fall.*&&>Kevin Feige, who runs the MCU, is a Marvel fan. He knows the source material, he knows the Marvel fans, and has delivered a staggering $16B so far for Disney.

The key imo is that Kevin Feige and the people at Marvel **know their characters**. They know them up and down, left to right, and they know exactly what they want to do with them. The people at LucasFilm have no idea what made Star Wars great. They demonstrated that with George at the helm, making the prequels, they're continuing to demonstrate it now without George at the helm. They don't know their characters, and they don't know what to do with them.&&I think a huge part of the problem is that they’re telling new stories that have no impact on the world within the movies. It’s all been prequels either explaining more in depth we already know or building on characters that are now dead.

For side star wars movies to really shine they need to be telling new stories imo. If I already knows what happens, how am I supposed to care?&&You hit the nail on the head. Especially with the analogy of taking B and C list heroes and making characters people love and want to watch. In Star Wars so far we have Rose Tico the Activist, Admiral Holdo the Plot Device, Poe the Very Very Poor Man's Han Solo, General Hux the Lovable Goof, Phasma the Very Very Poor Man's Boba Fett, and Rey the Mary Sue. All just awful characters and relationships filling the new trilogy to the brim. &&Fuck the fans in the ass. The story is all that matters, as long as you make a good story, who gives a fuck how faithful it is to the unofficial pantheon of Star Wars nerd canon.

The problem isn't necessarily that Star Wars ignored the fans, it is that they ignored good writing.&&But do we know how Wicket got his iconic spear? Or what creature he killed and skinned for his leather hood? And what about his famous catchphrase “yub yub”? True fans who’ve loved this character for 30-plus years deserve to finally find out what Wicket’s middle inital W means, and to see that amazing moment when he first met Chief Chirpa.&&It's some light treason then...&&Les Forces Dangereux&&I honestly think he made a good Star Wars movie. Unfortunately no one was interested in seeing it&&AD season 5 is tomorrow??&&It's a fairly safe bet after the response to A:IW, that Avengers 4 will even top Avengers 3 in box office returns.&&Let’s not forget toys, advertising, theme parks! My god I can’t wait to throw my money at them. It’s terrible.&&Engineers at Disneyland: Ok, we're just going to make this millenium falcon a quinjet and turn these stormtroopers into chitauri soldiers&&BP was still in theatres when IW came out. Crazy amount of lasting power.&&[removed]&&And the trailer I saw before Infinity War was just awful.  It told me nothing about the film.  Is there something big about Han's background we'll learn?  Is there some cool new villain?  Will it connect something in the established Star Wars movie?  What does it tell me about the lore?

Nothing, just a random collection of action shots that told me nothing.  A random adventure in the life of young Han/Chewie/Lando.&&It would have been just as poorly received but for different reasons.  ""they made Han Solo a joke!"" blah blah blah.  The things being thrown around about L&M's version were stuff like ""slapstick"" and ""Ace Ventura in Space"", if any of that was close to true, people would have fucking hated it.&&I loved Harrison Ford AS Solo but especially while he worked with Carrie Fisher as Leia. There was some kinda magic there and you can’t just keep the name and change everything else and still expect fans to give a shit. &&Maybe if the trailers hadn't been so boring and generic looking. I'm seeing it regardless \(I've seen all the other SW movies in theater with my Dad, not gonna stop now\) but it's the one I've been the least hyped for.&&Solo's character pre-New Hope is a greasy smuggler that probably made up the *""made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs""* line, and used it with the last five ship he stole. Mos Eisely is a wretched give of scum and villany and Han was at home there.

That starting point is necessary for his Orig. Trig. character arc to be meaningful. I don't want to see anything from before that and I especially don't want to see something that completely trashes the arc.&&Reactions here in the UK range from: “Solo what’s that?” To “oh I didn’t even know it was out” &&[deleted]&&What boycott?&&My thoughts exactly. TLJ did not inspire enough confidence for me to dish out 15 dollars to see a stand alone movie that screamed cash grab.&&100% agreed. The negative buzz on how much people were NOT interested in ""Solo"" from day one I felt should have been enough to make Disney give it the axe. Meanwhile all the buzz I've seen on Star Wars spinoffs had people frothing at the mouth about a McGregor-led Kenobi film ever since the concept of spinoff movies was announced. 

I haven't seen Solo yet (it's probably an at-home watch for me), but I just don't see how it's possible that Disney forged ahead with it by giving it a dump truck of money, then when it was turning out to be craptastic, gave it ANOTHER dump truck of money for re-shoots given the general public's reaction to the entire concept was ""meh."" &&> Is there some special Hollywood accounting trick being used here to justify this movie?

Was Mel Brooks secretly one of *The Producers* for this movie?&&I like the Solo character and felt his character arc was complete.  The closure we got for him with TFA seemed an altogether fitting way to put the character to bed.


A standalone Solo prequel was pointless.


It's as if we'd just finished a really satisfying 5 course meal, with cheesecake and coffee for dessert and as we're getting ready to leave the restaurant, the waiter comes to the table with a shrimp cocktail and some salads he'd forgotten to serve as appetizers.

Could be the best shrimp and salad ever, but no one's gonna eat it.&&>People like Han because we don't know his whole story. It's part of the allure.

I felt this was much of the power of the OT as a whole. When Obi-Wan tells Luke, ""Oh yes, I fought alongside your father in the Clone Wars. He was an incredible pilot,"" what makes that man exceptional is *the legend* more than any reality. It lives as much in Luke's head as it does the audience's. ""'The Clone Wars'! Holy shit I don't know what those were but they sound *intense!*"" Right?

Don't get me wrong; there's great moments in the prequels, the TV shows, and all the like...but every time something from backstory is fleshed out, it risks being underwhelming compared to the audience's imagination. That goes all the way back to Hitchcock. And despite the Star Wars universe having as much potential as No Man's Sky for planets, races, and so on (which is to say nigh or effectively infinite), every time these ""backstory events"" get fleshed out, the universe feels smaller. At least with Disney's storytelling. Like *these events* are the only ones that ever happened. Like...**If a tree falls and is heard in the OT, does it get a spinoff movie or TV show?**

I think back to the Episode 1 podracer game. Some of the planets were places mentioned elsewhere in the canon (Ord Mantell comes to mind), but many weren't. It *expanded* on the universe rather than continued to shade it in. Even *Shadows of the Empire*, which was to RotJ what they tried making Rogue One to A New Hope, seemed to add to the universe with Xizor's Black Sun crime syndicate even as it fleshed out what was just a line in RotJ: *""Many Bothans died for this information.""*&&Yea Harrison Ford is Han Solo

It's like if they did a Luke movie and have someone beside Mark Hamil play him&&*remakes attack of the clones but with a different twist*&&Or let him do like he wanted with the prequels and have someone else direct them while he executive produces. &&On paper, the story ideas for the prequel trilogy are great. It could have been a fantastic tragedy story, but it seems Lucas is a good ""big idea"" guy but terrible at character development. The prequels felt like they just trusted the audience to care about the characters and did nothing to ensure it. It also doesn't help that we know what happens in the end, so there was even less suspense.

I think with Solo, it was just seen as a naked cash grab. I personally had no desire to see it simply because at this point Han Solo doesn't interest me. I love Solo in the movies but I don't have much desire to see a standalone film about him.

It is also evident to me that Disney doesn't really know what excites people about Star Wars. It is a universe that has been around long enough that I think people are ready to look past what we already know. A good example was the success of Rogue One. It provided another look at the universe that popular culture is already very familiar with and offered a view of the Star Wars people had not seen before.

Solo's appeal seemed to be: ""The characters you love, except younger"".&&I think they keep hoping to make a big surprise hit for that weekend and grab the big headlines such as ""biggest memorial weekend ever!"". Solo was slated for this release date even before the shake up with the directors. They were just banking on making another holiday synonymous with the Star Wars brand, like they did with christmas.&&Worth noting, Solo broke the record for Memorial day Thursday evening preview sales, but that's kind of a low bar because the previous record holder was Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.

The underperformance is really sad because I enjoyed Solo a lot more than I expected, a really fun mostly standalone heist/caper film.
&&Alice in Wonderland has a sequel?&&There was an Alice in Wonderland 2?&&He is visited by Zuckuss, the bounty hunter of Christmas past, Bossk, the bounty hunter of Christmas present, and IG-88, the bounty hunter of Christmas yet to come. Plus Boba's old partner, Dengar. && ""You will be visited by three sarlaccs.""&&I would have put it in August. Literally no block busters there. And as suicide squad showed, if you have a built in fanbase and a terrible movie, you still make buttloads of money when you have literally no competition&&“Well Lawrence, are you happy now?”&&I've seen this mentioned before but I don't believe it. Kasdan has been in Hollywood jail since Dreamcatcher and even before then, he wasn't exactly the most powerful guy in tinsel town. I don't see anyway he could hold Disney over a barrel and force them to make a $250 million movie. They really didn't need him to write TFA and likely, he was chomping at the bit for a sweet pay day. 

Thats not to mention the fact that if Disney didn't care, they would have just let Lord & Miller do their thing and not add an extra $100 million on to the budget. 

&&> Reportedly it was only being made because Lawrence Kasdan would only agree to write The Force Awakens if they also let him write a Han Solo movie.

Reported where? Kasdan says [here](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-han-solo-movie-was-in-development-even-before-the-for-1825993882?IR=T) that he was brought on first for Solo then was asked to work on TFA later. He also says something similar [here](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/star-wars-the-force-awakens-vanity-fair-cover) (from 2015) that he came on to TFA after Arndt couldn't finish the screenplay.

And Disney dropping $200 million (or whatever the initial budget was) just to get the guy to co-write a different film entirely seems like a dumb, and pretty unlikely, business decision.&&I think they cared a little bit. They did essentially film the movie twice.&&Disney really is getting into a situation where their 5 production companies are nipping at one another's heels.

(MS) Infinity War eats into (LF) Solo which eats into (Pixar) Incredibles 2 which eats into (MS) Ant-Man which eats into (WD) Christopher Robin.

Then September and October are empty. (If I recall Mulan was originally in this window)

Then per month: Wreck-It Ralph, Mary Poppins, (no Jan release), Miss Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Spider-Man 2, Lion King.&&Also Memorial Day is one of the busiest weekends of the year for people. It's the summer kickoff, lots of travel, BBQs, etc. People don't want to go see a movie. The holidays are different. Star Wars was an event when it came out the weekend before Christmas, and then many people are off work or home for an extended period, where it's usually cold and there's little to do, and a movie is a great way to kill time or take some pressure off the ""family time"" of the holidays.

The should have just owned Christmas.  &&Not only that but it's also a time consideration.  We have a child and going to a movie means a sitter and other myriad arrangements.  My wife only went to Deadpool 2 because we lucked into a sitter on the Saturday on opening weekend.  Otherwise I would have went by myself.  Few years ago it wouldn't have mattered.

It's not just multiple movies on the same weekend but even the following or two weeks after can mean waiting until the home release.  This is the case for most of the people I know with small kids. 

For us it was IW, DP2, Solo.  We went to TLJ because it was spread out and around the holidays.  &&I think Disney also had a bit of an incentive to push the SW cycle back to Dec. since the real big Marvel movies tend to fall in early summer and you don't want them jostling to much. But that's just a hunch.&&So bizarre that we now live in a world where Disney has more confidence in the money making ability of a Mary Poppins reboot than a Star Wars movie... They really shot their wad too quickly with Star Wars. &&I don’t think December is that loaded. The Grinch, the tail end of Grindelwald, Aquaman, Bumblebee? They could have made Solo tighter and not made it premiere when there’s clear box office exhaustion from IW and DP2.&&I honestly completely forgot they killed him off. That’s how apathetic I’ve gotten about these movies.&&Let alone 4&&Or a Deadpool film!&&*Pacific Rim* (which I love despite its flaws) had a massive uphill battle due to garbage marketing and rather niche appeal. It made $411M worldwide - a number Solo will almost certainly not reach. We might actually be seeing the first signs of franchise profitability tanking. But Infinity War will probably act as a beacon to keep the studios inspired (to crank out *uninspired* franchise content in an attempt to imitate the MCU's success). &&> ""Who would have thought that ~~10~~ 9 years ago that a Deadpool movie would have opened $50mil higher than a goddamn Star Wars film.""&&Disney?&&That movie was basically Thanos, it steamrolled other massively powerful franchises without breaking a sweat. &&Dread it, run from it.

Destiny still arrives.&&I think for the franchises' continued success, they really need to movie away from the original/prequel trilogy stuff. It's a whole galaxy, after all. I think part of the problem might be that Solo just feels like more of the same, plus we already know what happens to Han in the long run.&&> Movie poster is plagiarized

Wait, really?&&Justice League looks like avatar compared to solo numbers.&&I didn't even know what this movie was... I had to Google it. 
&&Watched this with my wife last night. I actually enjoyed it, and most of the songs are pretty catchy. &&Mostly dollar theaters at this point for all of them. It’s cheaper to go to the dollar theater and see it than it is to buy it if you don’t buy anything at concession. &&It was a fun movie. Rock and Kevin Hart are still a pull.&&Someone clearly didn't see the staggering sum of money that Mamma Mia made over a long stretch of time.&&I've seen Greatest Showman 5 times in theatres. It's easily one of my favorite movies from the past few years&&But then that person might think it was because of them and be offended!!

Otherwise known as the German way.&&The MCU has source material that has been tried, tested, reviewed and criticized already. Marvel knows that story lines to adapt and what to ignore and what needs to be polished. Star Wars could have had that if they kept the EU but now need to come up with everything from near scratch.&&One difference with the MCU is their films have a lot of differing tones/looks. You've got gritty Winter Soldiers and wacky Guardians and heist film Ant-Man and psychedelic Dr Strange and buddy comedy Ragnarok.

I think pulling that trick off with Star Wars is trickier though, as people have a lot of preconceived notions about what a Star Wars film should be like. I don't think people will accept a Star Wars: Ragnarok.

But having said that I also think Marvel should cut back to two films a year at most.

Also in terms of oversaturation: let's not forget that Star Wars also has several TV properties: Clone Wars, Rebels, and now three(?) new series in development?
&&But those people have time and money.  Hollywood should consider them a little more often.&&If they had used AC Crispin’s Han Solo Trilogy as the basis for Solo I would have flipped out. There were a lot of Star Wars books but those were some of the best.&&Kylo seems a lot like Jacen Solo to me. 

&&To be fair, the books are pretty mixed in quality. There's some gems in there, but LucasFilms was very loose with handing out the license back in the day. It's not a simple as looking at the books for a good story.&&*You know what this franchise needs? Pink hair.*&&I love TOR lore, they really should go there and treat it the way Marvel treats their own lore: build a whole new universe with new character inspired by it.

Fans keep asking for it but instead they make a Boba Fett movie... they think they're serving the fanbase but end up with crap that neither the fans nor the casuals care about.&&I haven't seen Solo, but as far as I've heard, doesn't the movie tell the story of: [how Han got the Falcon; how Han got his last name; how Han met Chewbacca; and how Han became a smuggler?](#spoiler) How is that not trying to connect the dots? (NB: the commenter above you never said the movie wasn't *trying* to connect the dots, they said the movie didn't succeed in connecting any meaningful ones)

Everything I've read about Solo makes it sound like nothing but fan service and dot-connecting.&&Well they kinda did a young Vader movie. THREE of them actually. They were pretty bad. &&Have you seen the movie?  I wasn't a fan of the idea for a solo movie but after watching it, it was pretty enjoyable.  &&A big advantage that an Obi Wan movie would have over Solo would be that people really like Ewan McGregor and his portrayal of Obi Wan Kenobi is one of the most appreciated and enjoyed characters.

The cast of Solo tried their best, unfortunately people don't actually like Han Solo that much and really like Harrison Ford.&&People who know that material have been saying it for so long, I really hope they do it soon. Like, they can just look at the trailers for SWTOR for their concepts.. THEY'RE RIGHT THERE&&Revan: A Star Wars Story&&Honestly people say nobody asked for solo but Han Solos books way back in the 80s sold like crazy. 

Disney is doing nothing different compared to old Star Wars, which by the way was also milked, its just that next to Novels/Comics/TV-Shows and Games they are now also releasing Movies. 

For me as a hardcore EU Fan nothing changed and I honestly believe that „no one asked for it“ is a stupid argument. Nobody asked for Rogue One yet that seems like the only new movie everybody likes. 

I dont want Star Wars to do stuff the fans ask for because in that case all we‘d get would be Darth Vader and Darth Maul Movies. Because Reddit is a bubble and people forget that all you ever see on more mainstream social media like Youtube: „Am I the only one that wants a Darth ... movie?“ 

Nobody asked for Kenobi before the rumours took off and I dont even want a 2 hour movie with Obi chilling in the desert but im obviously in the minority. 

I cant agree with the mainstream fandom and their wishes at all. 

And when it comes to more hardcore fans I agree with 2 things: 

1. Kotor

2. New Era/Setting not held back by a timeline&&from what ive seen, even the people that hated the movie say they praise ron howard for the final product, cause all the stuff that came out about the movie, it was looking like the most recent fantastic 4 movie was gonna look oscar worthy by comparison, and then ron howard came in and effectively fixed it and made it watchable, even if the general consensus is a big ''meh'' instead of a ''holy shit this is the most terrible movie ever!''&&Just have Finn waking up again and Poe's like: You alright?

Finn: Yeah, yeah... I just had the strangest dream.&&Snoke projected himself in the throne room. He faked his death.&&What? I dont think that ever happened.&&We've always had a new cod game every year since the franchise began. At least they have three rotating developers meaning each game takes effectively three years to develop.&&And the merchandise has gotten ridiculous.

Come get your Star Wars shower gel, and then dry off in your Star Wars towel before you get into your Star Wars clothes and head to the kitchen to make a drink from your Star Wars energy drink in a Star Wars Tiki Cup. Then watch the Star Wars movies on your Star Wars themed XBox. 

It’s literally obscene at this level. Nothing wrong with figurines or lunch boxes, but I draw the line at Tiki cups and slippers&&That has literally never been a thing.&&Maybe you need a new hope&&She was the Sith Lord all along&&Exactly..I dont think Disney can be blamed here. Kathleen Kennedy has been handling the franchise very poorly.  &&Its a sad day when we can genuinely miss Lucas making these movies. At least he had actual ideas that had some sort of soul. It feels like Kennedy has a team of scientists build film ideas in a lab. &&There are people who would cream their pants if you announced a Obiwan prequel or Darth Maul prequel.&&> and not only that, he made a bad movie generally Star Wars or not.


Oh god, this!&&I seriously felt myself fall OUT of love with Star Wars during TLJ. 

I left the theater feeling depressed - took a couple days before it turned to anger.

I stayed away from the theater for Solo as a result, canceled my Hot Toys figures preorders and am basically done with it. (On the bright side, will save a lot of money!)&&Hahaha man I literally felt sick during it. I looked at my watch and there was still an hour left....&&Goooood....gooood....let the hate flow through you&&Definitely, fans of the movie wanted to think that it was only a minority that hated it but thats obviously not true.&&The prequels truly are written like a religious manuscript - it's perfect for situations like these.&&Exactly, they know their characters.

They created this massive popular universe with an infinite amount of stories able to be told within, but they still resort to the same old ideas and rehashing them again.

I'd love to see an actual Star Wars fan as the producer of LucasFilms.&&arguably george WAS the creative department at lucasfilm. it was his ideas that were canon. no one went against him or said ""hey maybe this part doesn't work""    
the new star wars movies are going exactly the same way for some odd reason&&You forgot Fin, aka Ron Stoppable. Which is funnily enough the best character they had from 7 besides maybe Kylo Ren and they sent him on a filler b plot that had no affect on the story in 8.&&You'll be surprised to learn that the above events all occurred within a three-day period!

&&You need to go and watch the Ewoks cartoon for the answers you seek.&&Kathleen: I've made a huge mistake&&Yeah, considering the situation he took over I think it turned out really well.

Hopefully word of mouth will help Solo, but I have no idea how much that can really do at this point.&&This is my whole take on it. 
I honestly didn't need to know the Solo backstory. He was a smuggler. A swindler. A hustler. Whatever... he was a POS with style. 
For the last 40 years I've never found myself asking ""I wonder what Solo did before the movies."" They made it clear enough for me. &&Has anyone blamed the film's direction? Pretty much all criticism I've seen is towards it's *production*. ie, the choice to make *this* film instead of, say, something different in the SW universe. If budget criticism (like in the OP) counts, then it's also production criticism.&&Yup. I know, I also blue myself&&It will. The ending of A:IW is all but ensuring that Avengers 4 is going to demolish box office records.&&>and turn these stormtroopers into ~~chitauri soldiers~~ in-universe cosplayers

Cheaper&&Imagineers&&It was hilarious to see it in the top 5 after like 7 weeks. and then it popped into the top 10 again when Infinity war came out.&&I was saying before either of those movies came out that they were Disney's big money makers and they were too close.  Turns out Disney is smarter than me, cause putting those two close together hasn't noticeably slowed either.&&[removed]&&The first trailer made it look like a ripoff of the Star Trek reboot. &&I thought the second trailer was much better than the first. I wasn't even going to bother going to see it before the second trailer came out.&&To be fair, that is exactaly what the movie is&&I think Harrison and Carrie worked so well on screen  because she wasn't acting.  To be fair, she was a great actress,  but she loved HF&&Im usually at the minimum, aware of when a SW-story movie gets released, i had zero idea this was out in theaters now. &&I liked Solo but I would have liked an actor who resembled Ford. My 2cents.&&I wouldn't mind seeing how he went from bright-eyed naive kid to that scoundrel. 

They kind of promised us that here, and the scenes with Woody Harrelson do partly succeed in that, but it fails in other scenes: Han is just too eager to help the rebellion here, undermining his arc in A New Hope. And we have the ongoing sequels where Han reverted to essentially the same guy as he was in A New Hope.&&I'm seeing the same, mention it and ask if someone is going to see it and the answer was usually a pause and then ""naaaah""


This runs the gauntlet from people who thought TLJ was the best and the worst SW film, so it's not even recent events that seem to be effecting that response.&&Seriously, im in the UK as well, and im only a casual movie-goer. I didn't even know Solo had come out until I saw this post.&&Han is the main ""character"" of the movie, but the actor playing him is far from being the movie's biggest ""star"". They figured showing Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, and Donald Glover would interest more people, not sure that paid off tho...&&I only saw one pretty detailed video about it, but some people are boycotting the movie in the hopes of eventually getting rid of Kathleen Kennedy. That's not the only reason, but that's one of the big ones. They believe she is totally mismanaging Star Wars and needs to go in order to save the franchise. I recommend searching it up on Youtube to get a better idea.

Edit: Don't take this as me supporting the boycott. I'm just presenting what I know. I like the new movies, but many don't. I agree that maybe somebody new at the head of LucasFilm could benefit everyone, but I don't think she's the absolute worst thing that's ever happened to Star Wars.&&It's not an official boycott or anything. But I for example, just don't feel like watching any other star wars movies, or at least paying to see them in theatres. At least not if they keep up with these movies that seriously disappoint me.&&I don't know anything about a boycott, but I am probably not going to see it because I haven't really liked the other movies and am planning on voting with my wallet.&&Just my experience: None of my friends and family who are SWs fans went to see Solo out of protest of TLJ. Its sad Solo was judged before it even came out, but at the same time some people don't trust Disney to make a quality SWs film anymore. 

The last SWs film made it a point to shit on all the hardcore fanbase; not a surprise that much of the fanbase wasn't there this time around.&&A lot of people are very angry with how Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson handled criticism towards TLJ and are now boycotting Star Wars.&&I feel the same. The only reason I want to see it is to see how Donald Glover was as Lando. &&When the directors left Solo over creative differences with Disney I took that as a bad sign for Solo (no spoilers please, I haven't seen it). Given that Disney pushed for and almost got a happy ending for Rogue One, I'm pretty sure Disney was on the wrong side of arguments over Solo. Also, TLJ was the Disney star wars movie I liked least. Half of TLJ was spoiled by the trailers, and the rest of the plot was pointless and superfluous.   

*Edit: I was wrong about Disney pushing for a happy ending for Rogue One, and I will try not to be wrong about anything Star Wars related again. &&And if any Disney producers are lurking here.... we all still want that McGregor Kenobi film. &&Seriously, I've ordered my tickets for the Thursday night before opening day the minute they're available for pre-order for all three Disney Star Wars movies before Solo.

I forgot Solo was coming out on Friday until looking up movies for this weekend last Wednesday and ended up ordering a ticket for Friday afternoon (which turned out to be completely unnecessary as the theater wasn't even a quarter full).

I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. Lots of stuff in there I really liked although, like any Star Wars movie after Empire, it has its flaws. Still, something went *way* wrong on the marketing on this one. They never sold even diehard fans on why they'd need to go see the movie. &&A Lando film with a few scenes with Han would have been much better.&&> I like the Solo character and felt his character arc was complete.

I feel like the entire *point* of the character of Han Solo was that he was an ordinary, if skilled, guy, who got dragged into something bigger than him and stepped up to make it work, and putting him in movies prior to A New Hope in such a way that he's a lead protagonist kind of undermines the character arc the original trilogy gave him.

Not that I wouldn't be pleased to have a lot of lower-tier-canon adventures featuring Solo and other characters in adventures that don't fit into the canon progression of events, so that we could enjoy seeing them in such situations, but putting Solo in the role of movie main protagonist before ANH strikes me as the equivalent of prequeling a movie about an egg that gets turned into an omelet with a movie where that same egg gets turned into a souffle. It may be entertaining, it may make an excellent souffle, it may be delicious, but eggs don't work that way.&&Eh.. Will Shatner *IS* Captain Kirk, but I think Chris Pine has done a great job in the new movies. I'm not going to stop watching Star Trek movies just because Shatner is getting old along with the rest of the world.

edit* to preempt some more replies, the point I was trying to make is that, with the right cinema climate, script, studio and actor/director, any beloved role can be recast. I haven't seen Solo, so I can't comment on that particular film, but I thought Pine was a great Kirk. I will always enjoy Shatner's performances when re-watching past episodes, but I'm not going to let that stop me from enjoying Pine now.&&Michael Cera is... SKYWALKER

^^Coming ^^May ^^2021&&You mean... with any twist at all?&&This is really the heart of the problem. The prequel story as a whole is great, it’s delivery and moment to moment stuff was just awful. &&Almost everyone I've spoken with who has *actually seen the film* at the very least enjoyed it.     
  
The only person I know who really hated it went into the film actively wanting to dislike it.  He'd been shitting on the film and it's troubled production for months and at that point I don't even understand why he still went and saw it opening weekend.    
  
I really loved it though.  I'll have to give it another watch to fully decide but it's either in my top one or two Star Wars films out of all the new ones.   I'd just have to watch it again to decide if I liked it more than Rogue One.  &&Yeah with Borat and Anne Hathaway. &&I love musicals&&Deadpool talking about leaving the kids at home was talking directly to you haha. And the babysitter was high as balls&&Marvel is probably a bigger franchise at the moment and Mary Poppins is a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.&&Yes. BP was released 3 months ago and it's about to make 700 million domestically and 1.35b worldwide. Infinity War was released 1 month ago and it already made 626 million \(including memorial day monday estimates, the actuals will likely go even higher by 1/2 million\) domestically and 1.91b worldwide \(likely reaching 2b\). 2 movies in the top 10 highest grossing movies of all time in the last 3 months, with DP2 also doing very well all over the world. I think both movies drained the box office of other movies. People that only go to the theaters a few times a year already watched BP and IW, and won't go again so soon \(specially since we already have Jurassic World 2, the Incredibles and another MCU movie coming up in a few weeks\)&&That's much better, as a 2009 audience would have just seen X Men Origins. &&r/MaliciousCompliance&&Disney is so big they are somehow both the biggest winner and possibly the biggest loser of 2018.&&Now I kinda want Avengers 4 to just be titled ""Thanos"".&&Exactly! At least Rogue One had an air of mystery about it. With this prequel, there is literally nothing that enticed me, as a casual Star Wars fan, to see this. I know how it ends. &&Yeah. [The posters \(the character ones\) were plagiarized from Sony Music.](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/disney-accused-plagiarizing-solo-posters-french-artist-hachim-bahous-1201936483/).

*""The posters were created by an outside vendor and it’s something we are currently looking into,"" a spokesman for Disney told The Hollywood Reporter.*&&It was a running joke in these weekly threads that it would never be out of the top 5 box office&&I want expecting to like it nearly as much as I did. It was actually pretty funny.&&Jack Black was the best part of that already great movie.

I went into it with almost zero expectations and it was the most fun I had in months. The last movie I underestimated to that degree was Office Space.&&Here we go again..&&I think audiences have been dying for more fun, clean, heartwarming films, and TGS fit the bill, even better since the music was awesome. 

In an era of sequels and prequels, this film was unique enough to pique interest in it, and with word of mouth, it was game over. &&""Hey, man. I'm gonna move over so we both get some more elbow room.""

Problem solved. &&I would actually hate thar person for sitting next to me in that scenario.&&There's nothing to prevent them from cribbing from the best of the EU going forward and adapting it to fit what they already have.    &&I also feel like the Marvel movies all feel different enough to really stand out.

Every Star Wars movie feels the same. You see the same vehicles, the same backgrounds, the same characters, etc etc.

Look at the difference between Spider-Man Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther for example. Those are all wildly different films in terms of locales and character motivations.&&I totally agree. I think every audience should have movies that appeal to their sensibilities. &&Of all the books in the old canon, those are among the most memorable. I particularly enjoyed how they incorporated Daly's Han Solo books, which, until that point, had always seemed like they didn't quite capture the characters or settings of Star Wars. Having Han go to the Corporate Sector to get over a chick seems to fit, though.

I legit cried when she left him, and I was as shocked as Han was when Boba Fett found him in Mos Eisley to tell him she was dead.

The Dash Rendar cameo that officially put the Outrider in Mos Eisley during Episode IV was a nice touch, too.

So many things to love about that trilogy.&&they can say that kylo ren isnt based off of jacen till they are blue in the face but there is way too many similarities to say they didnt.&&Jacob and Kyp Duron&&That didn't stop Marvel. Marvel has some horrific quality in comics at times and some great ones. The MCU is great because they take elements and merge it with new ideas. They could do the same thing with things from the books or games for Star Wars.  There's enough there to make a few great films. &&Agreed, but there are plenty of good stories from the old EU to use. The Thrawn trilogy would have made a great Episode 7,8,9 (and was kind of marketed that way when the books were originally released in the 90's).

I'm just sad that Disney trashed decades of Star Wars world-building (good and bad) for this mediocre rehashing.&&She's our best general. She's gonna stay behind and fly the ship on it's established course at a steady speed \- as a distraction.

&&Opening scene: We zoom in to Aech-2(or whatever Luke's planet is) and focus in on the rock where Luke disappeared. Luke stand up, he had fallen behind the rock after the great effort it took to project himself across the galaxy. Dusts himself off a little, some quick flash scenes of him getting ready to leave the planet, we watch his X-wing take off from another island.

The camera pans around to a sinister looking temple. At the top, a small outcropping is visible. Zoom in. Snoke stands up. ""Kylo..."" he says as if regretting training the boy. As he walks towards his own ship we zoom out and see the two islands. Luke and Snoke have been neighbors for countless years.&&I work at a grocery store and for months there was star wars stickers on fucking bananas and star wars packaging on lettuce l. Its fucking insane&&Exactly, the fact that she somehow thought making up the new trilogy movie by movie with different directors would be a good idea is indefensible.  And then on top of that she greenlit the last jedi's script which proves she is completely out of touch with the fan base and is in way over her head.  The worst part about this is solo was the best movie they've made yet and they'll likely blame everything besides the last jedi on its poor performance.&&Lucas is a story teller. He created archetypes and ideas with meaning and told them in an amazingly imaginative universe.

It's not a story that Disney would tell you.&&Fwiw, I felt like Solo actually respected the characters far, far better than either of the new trilogy films (even with having new actors play established characters). Which I think is one big reason most people who have actually seen Solo are really liking it.&&Ron Stoppable, that's perfect! His and Ticos story was just lame and lifeless.

I bet it was the same way for a lot of people. They set up the MCU so every movie is a must see.&&Right? If anything, they were close enough that you could start doing double features with them. That's a big difference: Panther and IW were beloved by fans. TLJ had a hugely divisive showing, and that raw spot is probably hurting them right now.

The second trailer was fantastic and was also what convinced me to go see the film (and i'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it)&&I thought it was fine. I think people are just to attached to Fords Solo and never want another actor in his place. I get it. Its like who will play the next Wolverine after Hugh Jackman? Mine as well put the role to bed after him. &&Which didn't work because both Harrelson and Clarke were playing ""safe"" roles (i.e the caring dad, but I'm really your dad and the femme fatal love interest.) At least Glover playing Lando was interesting to see how he'll do as the character and his acting range.

Also don't forget Chewbacca.&&I know Game of Thrones is popular, but Clarke is really not a great actress. She struggles to pull off the more weighty scenes in GoT and she was appalling in Terminator Genesys. Then again, that movie had a god awful script so she had little to work with.

I don’t think her appeal extends far beyond GoT fans though and I can’t see her getting a lot of high profile work once the show ends based on her performance in it. She’s probably the weakest of the ensemble cast.&&I'm boycotting out of a realization that I wasted my money on 3 forgettable star wars movies already and I just don't have an interest anymore. I'd say it's more that I just don't want to see it than a boycott. Which is probably what most people are doing.&&Not even the hardcore fans; I consider myself a filthy casual when it comes to SW-- didn't follow/read the comics/books, haven't watched a single Clone Wars animated episode, couldn't name any minor character to save my life --yet, the way Luke was made out to be what he was in the Last Jedi and his subsequent fate? I really felt some injustice had been done there. And then I later learned how Mark Hamill strongly disagreed with how Rian Johnson wrote the character's arc and how he threw subtle digs at Kathleen Kennedy at press junkets, which is a sad commentary in and of itself.&&No the reshoots for Rogue One were because the director thought Disney wouldn’t let him kill the characters, then when it turned out Disney wanted that he went back.

EDIT: Apparently I'm a bit wrong, the reshoots were to add more characterization scenes and some more excitment to the action scenes (like adding vader to that end scene)[Source](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14022380/rogue-one-ending-original-different-gareth-edwards)
>Edwards says that after reading the script, the production staff saw only one way out for Jyn and friends. “Everyone read that and there was this feeling of like, ‘They’ve got to die, right?’ And everyone was like, ‘Yeah, can we?’” But with the famously family-friendly Disney in charge, Edwards originally looked for another, lighter, more survivable ending.

>That was, until Disney gave him the green light to kill everyone. “We thought we weren’t going to be allowed to but Kathy [Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm] and everyone at Disney were like ‘Yeah it makes sense. I guess they have to because they’re not in A New Hope,’” Edwards told Empire. From then on, he had his license to kill, and **the survivor ending wasn’t even filmed.**&&I clapped when I saw Darthhhhh Vaddderrrrr!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfJRm0WssOE&&The directors were fired because they strayed from the story and wanted to make an out and out comedy.&&I'd see a Ron Howard made McGregor Kenobi film 2-3 times opening weekend. Howard seems to have the right tone for SW, even if this one flopped hard. &&I think the difference with Star Trek and young Kirk is that Chris Pine really captured what Kirk was like without making it a caricature. Chris Pine also was cast really well for Kirk because they look fairly similar in terms of face to head ratio. Kirk is a character who gets applied to Shatner and is then applied to Pine. 

Han Solo is less of a character than Kirk in that way. Han Solo is Harrison Ford. He's not a character which is applied to Ford. Ehrenreich just can't touch on that. 

The character of Han Solo is unlike Captain Kirk in that it is much more deeply tied to the actor than it is tied to the essence of the character. 

Also personally I feel Ehrenreich was a horrible choice for Han Solo, he and young Ford have so little similarities in appearance. Ehrenreich's jawline is too wide for Han Solo. Ehrenreich has the perfect face for a super hero than a scoundrel. 

Also, he didn't really look the part in wardrobe. He needed the Solo Vest to be more recognizable as Solo.&&I would watch this just for the pure absurdity and awkwardness of it.&&instead of boba clones, theyre clones of chewie! &&I went prepared to dislike it and it was EASILY my favorite of the new Star Wars films. &&> The only person I know who really hated it went into the film actively wanting to dislike it.

You sit there and be uncomfortable like the rest of us, god damn it.&&Indeed. We have Thrawn made canon now. The martial arts Tera Kasi was explicitly mentioned in Solo. I also thought Han's service history in the Imperial army used to be an expanded universe plot element. &&The relationship between Han and Boba was always an interesting one in the EU.

I remember a comic I read once where Han is being hunted by Boba and crash lands on a junk planet. While he's trying to survive, Boba jumps out of the shadows and Han draws on him, shooting and killing him. Guess it's over. Until a little while later, Boba appears again and tries to kill him, once again failing and being killed in the process. Over more time (Hours? Days? It's not clear.) Boba Fett keeps appearing and Han keeps killing him, sometimes more than one at the same time. He thinks he's going mad until Boba Fett appears one last time with a battalion of other Bobas and instead of trying to kill Han, he simply talks to him, revealing that he has reformed the Mandalorians and he was using Han as a way to weed out the non-hackers of his new recruits.

The point of this is that I feel in the EU there's always been a grudging respect between the two of them. It was an interesting dynamic.&&They gave us Jacen but replaced all of his depth and backstory with a weird hero obsession with Vader, which is ironic because Jacen's story was basically Anakin's fall to the dark side except done right&&It helps that Marvel has Kevin Fiege keeping everything together.  Star Wars still needs that central vision again without Lucas.  Until then...&&Yeah no one's really saying ""all the books are good"" cause God knows they're not. But they had a ton of good stuff they couldn't have drawn from. I mean, they're drawing some stuff, sure. Solo has some shades of AC Crispin's Han Solo books, the rumored plot for the Obi-Wan movie is, essentially, the synopsis of JJM's Kenobi, Rebels had Thrawn, etc. They're clearly still drawing from that Universe. It's just that as a whole their rehash isn't even as good as books that already were a mixed bag in quality. That says a lot. &&I loved the Thrawn trilogy, but even it had issues. The main issue I had with those books was that it focused on the main cast (Luke, Han, and Leia) as the same people they were at the end of RotJ. It felt like Luke had nowhere to go as a character and was basically a Mary Sue who would always make the morally right choice all the time. The overall plot was compelling, and Thrawn was a fantastic villian, but the character development on the good-guys side was weak.

If they were adapted into an Ep 7,8,9, I think a lot more focus would have to be on [Mara Jade, as she was the most compelling character who ended up on the good guys side.] (#spoiler)

(sidenote: not sure if you can really spoil a 25 year old book, but just to be safe...)&&What I didn’t really understand about that was she was needed on the ship to fly straight? They don’t have auto pilot?

It seemed to me, and I could be wrong, that flying into the destroyer at light speed was a decision she made on the fly and it wasn’t preplanned. 

If that was the case there would have been no reason to stay on the ship and let it fly straight. &&She's a complete asshole character with no likable traits, but guess what, we'll still make her a hero the plot didn't needed. &&The droids are too busy asking for equal right back in Detroit. Wasn't it obvious?&&I'm not sure what you would do with it, honestly. Vader works so well in Rogue One because he's used sparingly then goes apeshit. Vader mythos preserved. More screen time and focus opens the door for lots of not good things. &&[deleted]&&The Vader comics recently have been really good, so maybe Disney could use that as a template&&A part of me would really love to see that, especially after how fucking good his appearance in Rogue One was. But I also know that every time he is featured, it is tempting fate that his character will be cheapened. R1 did it perfectly, if anything it made him even more intimidating. But they *will* fuck it up eventually.
  
The problem is that Vader needs to be a villain, a monster. He is evil, not a protagonist. He wouldn’t even work as an anti-hero. A full-length movie with Vader will have to make him sympathetic, because you can’t have a movie where the main character is evil and ruthless and kills innocent people, without a redeeming arc. It just doesn’t work that way.&&Every now and then I rewatch them because they're just so good. Don't know how they'd translate into a movie but they do a better job than the prequels did in 3 movies with about 15 minutes of action (and this is coming from someone who actually quite likes the prequels).&&> The camera pans around to a sinister looking temple.

Like what did Luke *really* do besides being a bitchy old man? Rey could have gone there and found absolutely no one and gone back to the fleet and nothing would have changed.  Even the pseudo duel on the salt planet was irrelevant. &&Thats what I like about the documentaries for the old movies, a lot of ""well everyone shat their brains out in the desert of Tunisia because of food poisoning, which in retrospect was pretty hilarious. Especially since George brought himself loads of canned food."" A lot of laser noises were just dudes banging on large metal pipes in the middle of nowhere. The lightsaber blades kept falling apart so they had a stock of them.


Or for the prequels, how George liked the Neimoidian's heads and wanted something similar for the Geonosians, so he brought in a jar of termites since had been fighting them at home, to help inspire the illustrators. Some Mustafarian lava noises were just shotgun blasts. Along with the recent TIL about the crowds at the Mos Eisley  pod races just being a zillion painted Q-tips moving with the wind.


I love that when you watch the behind the scenes for the original six, they come across as zany messes that worked and had a living soul and everybody on the sets have stories and seem genuine. When I look at the new movies other than Rogue One, I don't really get that feeling of a living soul per se from the background stuff. Interviews with disney actors come across as mostly scripted scenes they filmed four or five times per question until the PR department signed off on them and then sent out to be published everywhere, just so artificial. Whereas with the original six it is basically Lucas jerking himself off in his office at home with a bunch of his personal collection behind him, excited that CGI is finally catching up to a point for him to feel confident about filming the trilogies. Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill laughing about burning eggs in the kitchen when visiting each other while learning lines, etc.

Whenever someone doubts Disney, I just point them to that. They may not make things hardcore fans want/like a lot, but they pander very, very well to the average movie goer to build that amount of trust. Just incredibly good track record of movie making that also coincides with lots and lots of money.&&Infinity War is barley going to reach 2B. A4 would need another $700 million just to reach Avatar.&&Someone literally [recut the trailer based on a similar premise](https://youtu.be/3TPY4TKo6uQ). &&Kind of like trying to do ""Young Tony Stark"" without RDJ.

Edit: I forgot to mention: Very cool&&IT BROKE NEW GROUND&&Pine also makes for pretty good ""alternate timeline Kirk."" That's the reason for the huge differences between JJ Abrams and Original Series Kirk.

Shatner Kirk grew up with discipline and one of the finest officers in Star Fleet for a father. Pine Kirk grew up without a father and his mother dating a bunch of abusive guys (or at least, it is heavily implied that they are.) Also, since George Kirk died during James T's birth, that means that James is an only child. Which is different than the Original Series where he has a brother he loves dearly (who dies in the same episode he is introduced in.)

A lot of childhood differences that can add up to why Pine's Kirk is the way that it is.&&Yeah, I went in expecting I’d like it but was wondering if I was gonna buy into someone else playing Solo. Then a few minutes in I forgot all about that and bought in. Him and Glover did a great job.  Also, Chewie was finally a main character and not a silly prop.

&&> I also thought Han's service history in the Imperial army used to be an expanded universe plot element.

It was but it was still better than what you got. He was going to be an Imperial pilot but then deserted in order to save Chewbacca when they were going to execute him.

My only exposure to Thrawn was in the TIE fighter PC game from 1994 but - hot damn - he was an *amazing* villain and a worthy successor to Darth Vader. It's a shame Disney didn't reboot Thrawn and gave us whinging space Nazis from /r/iamverybadass instead.&&Because design by committee with executives butting the fuck in.&&I like the theory that is was going to be Akbar who would crash the ship but Disney didn’t want to make people think of Islamic terrorists.

Perhaps, rather than following Vader, follow a Jedi on the run being hunted by him. It would give Vader the same cover of mystery and intimidation seen in R1’s ending if done right.

You don't have to rush straight past the big fall to the dark to have a good series of movies.  &&Give us two or three films abridging the 'Vong and the excellent development of the Solo and Skywalkers, then segue that into two or three films abridging the Legacy of the Force.

Instantly and easily some of the best back-to-back trilogies in science fiction.&&What Dave has done with the animated series has been great. He needs to be given control of it all because Kathleen is strangling the golden goose. &&Akbar's actor died so that was probably more of a factor.

Except then you remember that Carrier Fisher died and they still did what they did.&&>crash the ship

I still can't figure out why rebels didn't go with this approach during Death Star battle in original film 

Would save a lot of time and lives

In any previous and subsequent battle actually...&&holy shit allahu akbar, almost spit my coffee out. that would be so wrong and hilarious on so many levels&&Absolutely, that is one way to do it. I don’t have anything against this in theory, if they use him as sparingly and as appropriately as they did in R1, I would love to see more. But again, I just don’t want it to lead to the dilution of his character.
  
Btw, this is exactly why I don’t want a Boba Fett movie. He is an antagonist and he needs to remain as such. He is a ruthless and dangerous killer and bounty hunter, his character *will* be cheapened in a feature movie. He would be much more fitting in a role like you suggested, a stalking enemy.&&Thanos was sympathetic though, and actually had a decent amount of character outside of being evil. &&Take the end of Spartacus. What if instead of Spartacus's friends standing up and proclaiming, ""I am Spartacus!"" They just pulled him down and told him to shut up. It would have been like Rose there.

Finn actually sacrificing himself would be like Spartacus saving his friends by submitting himself to the Romans.

Or better yet, as people like to point out, Finn's ship was slowing down. Maybe he sacrifices himself, and it doesn't stop the laser but opens a hole. Rose, flying in from the side, joins him in his sacrifice and plunges into the little hole Finn created. That would be better and we'd probably like both of those characters. &&Comics have the benefit of the fact that their fans have already seen multiple interpretations of their heroes and their stories (through different runs/artists/writers, etc.), so it's not some kind of travesty when things differ from their source material.  Star Wars doesn't have the same luxury unfortunately.  Anything that doesn't mesh with what came before is vilified.  This applies to other adaptations as well.  I hated the Hobbit.  The changes they made were so glaringly unfit for Tolkien's mythology and the world he built.  Would I have hated it if I wasn't an avid Tolkien reader?  Probably less, although I don't think they were great movies on the whole, but you get the idea.  

Disclaimer: Not saying this is the only reason people didn't like TLJ, there were plenty of other reason to dislike it.&&Absolutely

Though I've met a couple that want comic book stories put directly into film. Instead of the film's being inspired by them&&We mostly forgive that horrible Mandarin debacle, and appreciate there will be subtle differences to how we know things. And when we finally do get some fanservice we go crazy&&The only thing that slightly irked me was that we'll never see a Planet Hulk live action movie because they used essentially the exact same plot for Thor Ragnarok.&&Yeah. I agree.  Having blaster battles and that war scene were awesome. Similar reasons why I loved Rogue One so much.  Plus Solo really reiterated that “used space” vibe I love about old Star Wars. &&I would have loved that, but there are two real-world problems that get in the way: 

1) Age of the actors for Han, Leia, Luke. To do this story right, they would have needed to start these movies years ago, so that you can start with Ben (Jacen) being young. 

2) Getting the actors to come back for that many movies. For example, Harrison Ford was willing to come back for The Force Awakens, but I don't know if he would be willing to come back for multiple films. &&And what they did with Tarkin &&Because they couldn’t. Disney just ignored all the lore in order to have a cool looking scene. &&I think that was my 2nd biggest gripe in the movie (outside of the casino subplot). The character took 1 medium/light cruiser and sent it to lightspeed directly into the enemy fleet, AND IT WORKED! Not only did it work, it took out like half of the fucking First Order fleet. So why don't more people do that? If i could trade 1 medium/light cruiser for half a fleet, and all you need for it is 1 pilot, i would do that all the fucking time.&&something about how allahu means good bye in akbars native tongue&&not at all the same thing. last jedi literally begins with rose's sister sacrificing herself to bring down a destroyer with her bombs. then rose shits all over that and says ""no, sacrifice is stoopid"" when there is literally a gigantic laser pointed at the remaining resistance fighters/asssets.       
the message is not stupid, the moment they chose to go with that message is. i actually lol'ed when the laser went off towards the door. i wanted a nice tight shot of rose's stupid face going ""well i fucked up"" and then the laser incinerating everyone in the base. then ren comes down and lightsabers rose and finn in the face and says ""sACriFice iS StUPid"" and does the chicken pose lmao &&I've never understood this train of thought. Don't you want a little bit of surprise when you go to the movie?&&They did ret-con the Mandarin thing a little bit with the ""all hail the king"" one shot though!&&Planet hulk isn't happening because of how the hulk's rights are split with universal. Using g the same plot in Ragnarok was a way of getting planet hulk on screen even though they can't do hulk solo films. &&I need a post-apocalyptic Star Wars story about hyperdrives being outlawed after a bunch of drunken space truckers accidentally shattered entire planets when they pulled the wrong lever.&&It's even worse than that. All you need is a hyperdrive, navigation, and some dead weight. There is no need for the cost to build fully functional kamikaze ships when a few lightspeed missiles will do.&&>I think that was my 2nd biggest gripe in the movie (outside of the casino subplot)

That one was boring but at least it only ruined one film, ship crash ruined all of them retroactively 



>all you need for it is 1 pilot

Or a droid if no pilots feel like it that day...&&Definitely. Tangentially, that message ""We don't win by destroying what we hate but by saving what we love,"" is begging the question, ""¿Porque no los dos?""&&I don't mind surprise, but I'd argue that 9/10 when movies try to deviate from the source material for reasons other than time management, it ends up being a glaring difference and is distracting more than complimentary to the story.

Marvel has done a good job of toeing that line so far though.&&>post-apocalyptic Star Wars story about hyperdrives being outlawed

That's the most devastating line in the piece for me.

This one sucks, but it's not like there weren't rumors about freeman and questionable behavior with women. 

There are absolutely none about hanks. So either he's a mastermind perv, or he's just a good dude.

Just because so many celebrities have gone down doesn't mean there aren't good people out there. &&At least we always will have Mr. Rogers. &&Eh, its not as surprising with Freeman. His personality has always been a bit aloof and hard to pin down.

Hanks has always seemed rather outwardly genuine in his good nature. I think we are safe.

Edit: But also it seems there usually some rumors flying about with these men, maybe within a small circle. I don't know that I have ever heard any whisper of Hanks being inappropriate.

I also think I should not have engaged this because now we have people worried about Hanks when he never has had accusations against him. Worry about your own family first. &&Just so no one is confused. This is an altered movie quote from Shawshank Redemption.

The overall point of these articles is less about the individual subject and more about making a direct and immediate change on the environment in hollywood so that no one feels comfortable enough with their status and power that they can abuse a woman without repercussion.

It's why these articles are going to keep coming, and it's why it doesn't really matter if we don't remember all of them at the end of the day. All of these stories are just fuel for the bonfire. &&""MmMmMmMmMmMmm*HMM!*""

That really perfectly describes many sexual abusers and even things like old racists (“grandma’s from another time, just ignore her”) and how we are socially hesitant to be the one to try to “fix the stair”.

My dad (a truly terrible person) fits this to a t, and when I would confront him about his behavior, he didn’t understand my problem because people have been “stepping around” him for years. So it’s difficult to be the person who finally stands their ground against such an abuser, other victims tell you it’s not even worth the trouble of fixing the stair. 

Stepping around this type of person enables them to think their behavior is acceptable simply because few (if any) people call them out on it. It can be scary or even dangerous to try to call them out! 

I hope this current wave of prominent rapist shaming will empower more people to confront, interrupt, and prevent sexual abuse.

I'm okay with Rami not looking/sounding quite like Freddie, he looks close enough. If I wanted to watch Queen, I'd watch Queen concerts or music videos. I don't know how good the movie will be the teaser was lackluster. But I'm excited about the movie still.&&Glad to see Delilah getting the spotlight she deserves!&&So Brian May just posted this on his Instagram:

I'm still guessing this will be a pretty by the numbers biopic, which I typically hate and avoid, but as a very avid Queen fan it looks like it's doing them justice and at this point that's all I care about. &&I pity your wife if you think 6 minutes is forever. &&Regardless of how good/bad the film is, the soundtrack will be fanfeckingtastic.&&Producer #1: How do we show people that this is a *Queen* biopic?

Producer #1 & #2 \(in unison\): Eureka! Somebody give this man a raise!&&Honestly can't wait, looks pretty decent.&&I see a lot if talk about how without the mustache that Rami looks nothing like Mercury. That was always going to be true whether he played him or Sacha Baron Cohen played him. Freddy Mercury is such an iconic figure and uniquely looking man that it's impossible to get someone that looks like him. What's important is whether he gets the body language and personality down. Is he able to embody the person Freddy was? You won't get that from a trailer and only the full movie will tell how Rami handles the actual character of Freddy Mercury.&&Do right by Freddie. Please.

That 'six minute' line sounded really weird and Americans don't have the best track record for English accents.&&Plot synopsis:

*Described as a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury, who defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound, their near-implosion as Mercury's lifestyle spirals out of control, and their triumphant reunion on the eve of Live Aid, where Mercury, facing a life-threatening illness, leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. In the process, cementing the legacy of a band that were always more like a family, and who continue to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.*

Malek will likely do fine and this should  be a blast for any fans of the band.&&Let me add my 2 cents to some rumors surrounding this movie that are getting repeated here and elsewhere again and again:

**1. The band wanted Freddie's death midway through the movie and then focus on the remaining members**

This is based on Sacha Baron Cohen's interview with Howard Stern where he said:

>“[After] my first meeting, I should never have carried on because a member of the band —I won’t say who— said, ‘This is such a great movie, because such an amazing thing happens in the middle of the movie.’ I go, ‘What happens in the middle of the movie?’ He goes, ‘Freddie dies.’ I go, ‘So you mean it’s a bit like ‘Pulp Fiction,’ where the end is the middle and the middle is the end? That’s interesting.’ He goes, ‘No no no.’ So I said, ‘Wait a minute. What happens in the second half of the movie?’ And he said, ‘Well, we see how the band carries on from strength to strength.’ And I said, ‘Listen, not one person is going to see a movie where the lead character dies from AIDS and then you carry on to see [what happens to the band].” - [source](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/sacha-baron-cohen-says-david-fincher-eyed-queen-biopic-producers-wanted-freddie-mercury-to-die-mid-movie-263717/)

I'm sorry, but this is bullshit. I'm not calling Sacha Baron Cohen a liar. Maybe there was some misunderstanding of epic proportions, maybe someone didn't get a joke? I don't know but the idea that the 2 remaining active members Brian May and Roger Taylor wanted the movie to be about them is utterly absurd. They are very aware that to the general public Queen was and always will be personified by Freddie. All post-1991 relases feature Freddie alone or the whole band on the cover. The recent documentary ""Queen: Days of Our Lives"" focuses on the years with Freddie and only dedicates a few minutes at the end to the 25 years afterwards. And that was an ""official"" documentary with the band heavily involved.

More importantly though, even in the very early stages - 3 years before Cohen left the project - the movie was supposed to focus on the years leading up to the Live Aid concert in 1985 - 6 years before Freddie's death. [source](http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-11340336)


**2. The band want this to be PG-13**

This is probably based on the aforemention interview where Cohen said:

>“There are amazing stories about Freddie Mercury. The guy was wild. He was living an extreme lifestyle [of] debauchery. There are stories of little people with plates of cocaine on their heads walking around a party,” Cohen said, before adding that was exactly the kind of thing the surviving members of Queen didn’t want depicted in their biopic. “It [becomes] a less interesting movie, but you’ve got to remember that they want to protect their legacy as a band, and they want it to be about Queen. And I fully understand that.” - [source](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/sacha-baron-cohen-says-david-fincher-eyed-queen-biopic-producers-wanted-freddie-mercury-to-die-mid-movie-263717/)

Yes, there are those stories. And the members of Queen have openly talked about some of the extravagant parties but not so much about the drugs. I've read both the books by Freddie's long-time assistant Peter Freestone and the one by his last partner Jim Hutton. Both mention Freddie's drug use, but they also mention that he took drugs to get high and party. They didn't define him, he wasn't addicted, they weren't integral to anything really. Something way more important to Freddie would be sex, but I have a hard time imagining those who keep bitching about wanting all the heavy partying and drug use to be in the movie also wanting lots of gay sex scenes.

Also, Brian May has more than once said that you can't quote Freddie without swearing, so I have my doubts about anyone pushing for this movie to be rated PG.


I encourage everyone to watch the excellent documentary ""Queen: Days of Our Lives"".

But often times to consolidate the movie they will put a fact in but change the dates up.

I love Queen so I hope this movie does them justice, Rami is terrific in Mr. Robot so I hope he nails this and gets a solid film career rolling. 

I'm just always nervous when too much of a persons/groups life story tries to be crammed into a 2 hour film. Between the Singer being fired/replaced as director, I really hope they were able to pull this together. &&I read an article, I believe in Rolling Stone, about the creation of Bohemian Rhapsody.  There's a quote from someone about Mercury playing him his work in progress for the song on piano, and stopped at one point and said a variation on that line, something like ""That's where the operatic section kicks in"" ... a very distinctive line, and I was really excited to see it used in the trailer.

Edit: found the reference: 

>Thomas Baker, who had worked with Queen on their music up to this point, has told the story of the first time he heard ""Bohemian Rhapsody"": ""Freddie was sitting in his apartment, and he said, 'I've got this idea for a song.' So he started playing it on the piano. . . . Then he suddenly stopped and said, 'Now, dears, this is where the opera section comes in.'""

I read this comment first and thought I was gonna hear songs back to back. I actually like the transitions and mash-ups. Queen has so many hits, it gives me chills to hear them collaged like that. 

I think this looks like a blast, and seeing Mike Myer's as manager is refreshing. 

One thing though, were his teeth really comically that big?

New York's hottest club is Bohemian Rhapsody. If Jaws was never your scene and you don't like Star Wars, this might be the place for you. This place has everything: supersonic men, fat girls on bicycles, and if you come at nine precisely you can even get a human crack table.&&What Sacha Baron Cohen said it's an extremely believable thing because it really is a standard and everyday thing while writing/pre-producing a biopic. It's not even a bit out of proportion.

People who were in direct contact with the person (or the person itself) the biopic is based on very often sell their rights at their condition, and that condition is literally 'you can just tell this fact' or 'you cannot even remotely mention this moment' - aka, creative control. Which is pretty much the reason why most biopics suck. For instance, *American Sniper* has a horrible discontinued structure because the protagonist's father didn't want certain things in the movie (which along with the fact Eastwood doesn't do re-writes pretty much effed up the movie). 

On top of that, a lot of important facts in a person's life are strictly private, which means they may not be public and the person/family decides not to share, and certain obvious changes that happened in a person life are either made up or just ignored, resulting in a poor narrative. 

In other cases, they result sugar coded, like *Straight Outta Compton* (which might not be extremely sugar coded, but removed a lot of shit to make the characters look better). 

In most cases, though, they are just not memorable if not for things unrelated to the story like the performances. Coincidentally, this biopic is written by the guy who wrote *Darkest Hour* and *The Theory of Everything* (both very safe in portraying the characters), and also wrote the upcoming *The Pope* (which I guess will be about the decision and consequence of disowning the papacy by Pope Benedict - at least according to the few data on IMDb). 

> I have my doubts about anyone pushing for this movie to be rated PG.

It's a Freddy Mercury movie titled after arguably the most popular song of all time, and it's easily marketable. I easily see why they want a PG-13 with an unrated version released in Home Video. 

In addition, *Darkest Hour* and *The Theory of Everything* were PG-13 too. 

I undeniably see your point of view, but being business oriented doesn't mean they know better than Sacha Baron Cohen about movies (and I guarantee you they don't), nor the grasp on the audience helps much when deciding what to do. Remember: they continue to do concerts after Freddy died, so I see as a real possibility they might have thought the audience was interested in their lives too. 

I honestly have no hopes for this film, and not because of what Cohen told us. It won't tell us anything we didn't know already and it will be all about Rami Malek's performance (which doesn't convince me so far). I don't think it will be good, but we'll see.


&&I mean you are basically calling Cohen a liar on little more than your own feeling. I have no corner in this fight but you have to see your comment isn't close to objective.&&I haven't watched the documentary but from watching Mercury interviews , other band members interviews etc. it was interesting to see how business oriented they were.

Now leave me in peace so I can have my cup of tea and maybe do a bit of gardening this evening.&&Okay, so what would make Mercury look bad?

Maybe I'm a dilettante here but I am unaware of any huge scandals, or wrong doings by Freddie during his life with Queen.

I mean there's the whole gay thing, AIDS, etc.  But that's nothing to make someone look bad about..&&Actually, I think he said that in real life!  Maybe not to the guy’s face, but Freddie was pretty salty if he wanted to be.  Listen to the first track on Night at the Opera, it’s called *Death on Two Legs* and it was directly written by Mercury to be a final “Fuck You and Good Riddance” to their awful manager, who left the group shortly before they made it REALLY REALLY BIG.&&Not really. Freddie could be very sassy when he wanted. If you look up old interviews of him there's a few where he's sassy with the interviewer.&&What? Isn’t she like 92 or something now?? &&Freddy had mad buckteeth. Was very self-conscious about it, but never fixed them because he was worried how moving his teeth would effect his voice.&&Yeah, I agree, I thought the mashup was pretty killer. They didn't just fade from one to the next, there were overlays, transitions, stolen beats.&&> Is it bad that I actually like the mix?

Yes, stop liking stuff.&&Bohemian Rhapsody and We will rock you is the mashup I didn’t know I wanted at all&&No, the mix was great. People just want to bitch about things. This looks fantastic from this trailer and I can't get over how much Rami looks like Freddie. &&Yeah, the trailer made it work. It kinda hammered home how many hits they really have.&&Yeah, I loved the mix. Why are people so down on this movie? I know he's not Sasha Baron Cohen but come on.&&Wait... Mike Myers, the creator and star of the movie that re-launched Queen into the musical stratosphere in the 1990's... is playing the manager?&&Hearing them in succession certainly got me hyped. And i dont wanna get ahead of myself but it looks like Rami Malek is gonna be dynamite in this.&&No. And all raises are done using percentage increases.&&> Intern (now Lead Producer): Magnifico-o-o-o-oooo.

FTFY.  ;-)&&Jesus. I'm glad to see someone say this. The top comment is complaining about Queen songs in the trailer?!&&They want Freddie Mercury to play himself because that's the only person that looks, sounds and acts like him perfectly.&&I remember hearing about that, I’m definitely glad they didn’t go down that route, I think some people are confused thinking the movie is about Queen entirely, when in fact it’s about Mercury’s life. &&He looks fine when he has a mustache or sunglasses covering his face.&&In that case I can't not see him as the pharaoh in Night of the Museum.&&But like also Elliot's ww2 marine vet grandfather SNAFU&&I know right? The whole time I was like ""haha look at Mr. Robot go!"" &&Or Snafu from The Pacific. He was so great in that role.&&Bear with me here. I heard that line, and like you thought *something* was off. Something I recognised. I just couldn't put my finger on it. Was the accent wrong? Did it sound slightly Mexican or something? I listened again, and no, the accent was okay. But *something was wrong*. Something *recognisable*.

Again and again I listened, and refined further what the problem was. It wasn't the accent, it wasn't the inflection. It was the teeth. It was the fake English accent through big fake teeth.

Then it hit me like a ton of bricks, [baby!](https://i.imgur.com/QH3Bym7.gif)&&Oh, without a doubt. &&And Dan Cortese.&&Stefon, what is a human crack table? &&Seth Meyer voice: “What’s a human crack table?”&&I’m going to be that guy. It’s “sugar coated”&&[You're not kidding.](https://youtu.be/azfHrtgaLgc?t=12s)&&Every single thread about this movie has a comment mentioning Sacha Baron Cohen as one of the top comments, and I think it will keep staying this way.

Even if Rami absolutely smashes it, there will definitely still be comments saying how they can't help but wonder if Sacha could have done better, or just mentioning that whole thing about how he left because they didn't want to tell Freddy's *real* uncensored story, and what a shame it was (which it was).

It's getting somewhat annoying. It's understandable, but still annoying. I kinda feel bad for Rami It's like he'll forever be in Sacha's shadow now when it comes to this. People don't even know if Sacha actually would have done well. Don't get me wrong, it's fair to assume that he would, but factually speaking, we will never know. Yet, Rami will still be pegged against this dream imaginary vision of Sacha being the perfect Freddy Mercury and that is not a battle that he is going to win.&&but Ant-Man would've been so much better directed by Edgar Wright!&&I'm calling it now. Somewhere in the crowd at Wembley&&Hello Marmite. I heard a rumour that was a little concerning that while this film is centred around Freddie, it completely avoids any aspect of dealing with his contracting AIDs and living his life \- any idea if there's any truth to this as while I wouldn't expect ti to be the central focus, it \*is\* an important part of Queen's history where Freddie's concerned.&&And his wife?&&We're sure it's not a powdered wig?&&All this time I thought I was alone in the world. I've gotten so much shit my entire life for rocking my man curls. &&Today's media in a nutshell.&&It’s also *about* his cat Delilah.&&Lol it was horizontal and apparently Freddie would play backwards behind his head while lying in bed according to Brian May.&&He almost cancelled Wayne's World when the studio didn't want that scene in the movie.&&They didn't really even ask permission. They made it, THEN Mike Meyers called Brian May and asked if he wanted to see it. So he sent the clip to Brian May, who showed it to Freddie, and they both thought it was hilarious. 

Meyer's was fuckin elated that Queen loved it so much. Brian May actually sent him a signed guitar. 

But Queen also loved it because it brought them back on the charts in the US where people were starting to forget about them.
&&and I think they showed the film to freddie before it released &&I really bet it’s because of the iconic way they depicted people enjoying it as a group. It was a little bit macarena-ish in the way it was brought back.&&yup. it kinda just was Freddie Mercury. same with Liberace, weird looking back on it.&&[deleted]&&Gay culture didn't really exist in people's minds back then.  This kind of imagery didn't represent ""gay"" to society, it just represented weird rockstar lifestyle.  &&To be fair, he wasn't gay. He's bi and had female lovers too.

http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rockets_creem80.jpg&&Well he wasn't strictly gay either, so I'm sure that confused people. In fact he contracted HIV from a woman.&&11 year-old me was shocked... SHOCKED!!... when I found out that the Village People were gay. People at school would literally have debates. It was an odd and ignorant time. &&As someone who lived through it, if you were just obviously totally flamboyantly gay you were accepted as a celebrity performer.  People expected it.  Everyone sort of knew guys like Liberace and Freddy were gay but they still hid their sexuality.  You never see pics of Freddy or Liberace kissing men.  On the other hand some random dude in public acting gay would be mercilessly harassed.  People forget the whole flamboyant Twink thing is a defense mechanism.  Also I'm not gay, but had gay friends explain Freddy to me back in high school, lol.&&I still can't believe Liberace was gay. I mean, women loved him. I didn't see that one coming. &&It depends on who you were. I was a huge fan of Freddie Mercury long before I knew he was gay, and that just cemented my love for him, but Queen's nods to gay culture were not subtle. One Vision is practically a love-song to the gay club scene, Don't Stop Me Now has that wonderfully suggestive gender-swap, Killer Queen is the James Bond of playing with gender roles... yeah, those who paid attention knew exactly what Mercury was up to, but if you lived in the heterosexual bubble, then it was just good, clean fun.
&&The guys in the band knew.  He was actually bisexual; ""Love of my Life"" was written for his girlfriend Mary.  He also left her his entire estate.&&No, no, *bisexual*.

The love of his life was a woman. &&The very thought of someone popular and successful being gay was impossible. Like, oh, his look is a little gay but... he's a successful public figure, so it can't be that.&&probably more like, “i’ve peaked. it’s all downhill from here.”&&""don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage don't fall off the stage""&&I believe he was the first choice for Freddie, but turned it down for some reason. 

EDIT: Just looked it up. He dropped out because of a disagreement with the band members about the direction of the film. &&I say Royce &&I remembered him from that series and I have a hard time recalling any other actors &&That's actually part of what got him the job on Mr. Robot. &&I aint scrub drums for no man.

It’s only Redditors and other people who follow movie news religiously who’ll be comparing Sacha to Rami. And even we’ll eat our words because Rami’s a goddamned starboy.
  
Still, I _do_ wonder how Sacha would’ve been in this role...&&Rami deserves a chance to prove them wrong. Judging by the trailer alone, it looks totally possible he can pull it off. &&I'm actually more sad about not getting the uncensored story than I am about who plays Freddie. 

I'm just worried that we're gonna get another Straight Outta Compton situation where the movie is way to biased due to some members of the group having to much control during production.  &&Old man giving sage advice somewhere on the road.&&Hey there! How're you? :)

So I'm sure you read the reasons that Sacha Baron Cohen left the movie, and I definitely agree with you that the idea this movie will downplay Freddie's contraction of AIDS is troubling, but here's what I can see from a few watches of the trailer:

The movie's going start at least from around 1969-70. There's a clip of a young Freddie approaching Brian and Roger whilst they're still in Queen's precursor band, Smile.

There's plenty of shots of Mary Austin, Freddie's lifelong friend and early partner. This is important, because it was Mary who suggested that Freddie might be gay when Freddie couldn't perform romantically.

It's going to portray Freddie's sexual evolution and later romantic life heavily, given that there's plenty of shots of him in private situations and clubs with men. How graphic/deep it will be depends on what sort of rating they want to go for, I suppose.

I haven't been able to pick out any definite clips that seem to be set past the mid 80s, but it's entirely possible that they're leaving those out so they don't give everything away.

I definitely don't think it's going to shy away from Freddie's  romantic life, contraction and death as much as Sacha said, but there does seem to be a lot of screen-time dedicated elsewhere.

TL:DR: I can't say for sure yet, but I don't think it's going to be as saccharin and ignorant as a lot of people fear it will be.&&it's contagious&&Albert Einstein &&She grows naturally too.&&/r/powderedwig mod here:

I don't have a problem with it if he was, but he had female lovers throughout his life.  I'd call him rockstar bi.  Freddie could do and did whatever the fuck Freddie wanted to do.&&Exactly.  There wasn't an image or a stereotype to fit people into as much as there is today.  We look at people dressing like this in the streets and immediately our minds identify it because we have a few decades it being in mass media, whereas in the early 80's that kind of connection didn't exist&&Man if my obituary details everyone I have banged like his... that's gonna be one short obituary.

Like half of it was just about how many lovers he had lol&&Something about the phrase “self-confessed” makes it sound so tawdry. &&There were so many jokes and comments in the 80s and 90s about Rob Halford dressing like he was gay.

&&Carrying Freddy Mercury is a pretty good peak if you ask me.&&Probably more like ""Don't drop Freddie Mercury. Don't drop Freddie Mercury!""&&The word is that Sacha Baron Cohen's vision for the movie clashed with the remaining members of Queen, where Cohen wanted to tell the darker side of the band, while the remaining members wanted to paint themselves in a better light. 

Ultimately Cohen didn't agree with what the remaining members of Queen allowed Cohen to showcase, leading to his resignation from the film. 

Of course, this could be purely speculative Reddit discussion as who really knows what happened but themselves. 

EDIT: He did an interview with Howard Stern 2 years ago, and according to the interview, the internet discussion seemed to be correct.

I thought, well this movie automatically has the sickest soundtrack in the world.&&I think it's worth noting that Wayne's World helped tap in another generation into Queen, broadly.  Queen was huge with the generation before mine \- those who grew up in the 70s and early 80s.  When Wayne's World came out, mainstream music was in huge flux.  70s Rock gave way to 80s New Wave, which forked pretty heavily into Pop and Alternative.  Wayne's World was a dying gasp to the Hair Metal folks who worshiped Queen, Aerosmith, and Alice Cooper \- which, because of the popularity of the movie, exposed the plaid\-wearing Pearl Jam/Nirvana disciples to a whole new world of amazing.  Myself included.

It was as if Mike Myers said ""I hear you guys, when you say this is awesome.  But this is their older brethren, and these are AMAZING."" \- glossing over all the Blondie, Duran Duran, and Bon Jovi in the process.  It tied my generation to theirs in a way we could never connect with the 80s.  

Ironically, it's analogous to what kids today are doing with 80s music.  Today's kids really can't connect to Nirvana and Soundgarden as much as they seem to connect with New Wave idols.&&Without a doubt.

Going to take a nap. &&I'll have to dig and find the source for it, but another factor I remember reading is that Cohen wanted the movie to focus on Freddie Mercury, and essentially end when Mercury passes. The band wanted the focus to be more on the band, and to show that the music doesn't end simply because Mercury passed (the music totally ended).

""I go, 'What happens in the middle of the movie?' He goes, 'Freddie dies.'"" While Cohen assumed the band meant the film would be structured non-linearly like Pulp Fiction, he soon realized that they wanted the second half of the film to focus on how Queen carried on after Mercury's death in 1991.&&Bummer,  Sacha Baron Cohen would've been perfect for this role.&&Give me a choice&&m'ask ya sumthin

Pretty sad. &&I can't remember which podcast it was but Miller acted like Spielberg was going to bring him on as a personal best fried/co-worker and that's why he left Silicon Valley. He acted like HBO was beneath him once he got Ready Player One. I used to love him, now I despise him, mental illness and physical brain illness aside. He needs help and drop the ego.&&TJ needs to spend a long, long, long time in rehab and be genuinely clean before anyone will touch him.  His career path now will have to mirror what Robert Downey Jr. did to rebuild his career after Ally McBeal: do tons of indy films, be a first rate citizen, and continue to be clean until someone gives him a shot at a studio film again.&&Has anyone had as fast of a rise and fall as TJ Miller?  Dude went from being in everything two to three years ago, to being unwanted.  Granted he brought it on himself, but still.&&They should replace him with Don Cheadle and act like nothing has changed.&&[deleted]&&He could change his name to ""TJ Maxx"".  Embrace the persona  ""someone out of style, that no one wants, that can be bought cheap"".  Sharknado 14 calling.&&Sucks to hear but obviously understandable, the chemistry he had with Ryan Reynolds was pretty good&&[deleted]&&dude has brain damage. self medication clearly isn't helping, but he's clearly in a dark place he may never leave.&&I'll share my TJ Miller Story:

I was at a taping for Late Show with Stephen Colbert and TJ was the guest. He was acting weird on stage, took out an egg, which seemed to surprise Colbert (and not canned surprise). He then smashed the egg on his forehead,  and some of it splashed on Colbert's suit. 

Afterwards they cut to commercial, Colbert looks pissed and walks back to the dressing room, comes back with what looked like a new jacket. 

It seemed as if TJ tried to do some ""crazy"" shenanigans without running it by Colbert and he ended up looking like a twat.

Jon Baptiste and Stay Human are fucking AMAZING. Best band in late night. &&Jin Yang!&&""Despite a ten percent chance of death during surgery, doctors removed a golf ball-sized chunk of Miller’s brain after the discovery. Miller began filming “Yogi Bear” abroad when the comedian began acting erratic. He managed to return back to the United States and later suffered a seizure while pitching a movie at a restaurant about the online chat site Chatroulette to his manager at the time. Miller candidly recounts his entire life-threatening ordeal in the Comedy Central’s series, “This is Not Happening”. 

...He became acting erratic as a side-effect of this brain problem so these recent events might also be related =(&& “Look, children, a falling star”&&This article was apparently not looked at by an editor.&&""He didn't feel so good""&&They should just replace him with a new actor and use the 4th wall to explain it a funny way. Deadpool makes this so easy.&&Damn, I used to think that guy is gonna be a star or something, but after the recent incidents , now i don't think the same way, brain surgery it's been years, I don't know why is happening after deadpool, maybe personal issues or something like that. After so many years of problems with drugs or financial problems, it's still happening, a lot of people doesn't learn. Hope the actor rehab and be better.&&This article seems to suggest that he’s not going into X-Force because X-Force is going to be a team up movie. Side characters aren’t usually present because of bigger main cast. 

I’m sure his recent actions aren’t helping the possibility of a return in Deadpool 3 though. If there is a Deadpool 3. &&He's stuck at that Tibetan monastery.
&&Urlicka Bachman isa dead. I own ten percent x-force now.&&Between the harassment accusation and the bomb thing, his movie/TV career is probably done. As far as I know, the harassment thing has some gray area, so I'll focus on the bomb scare. It's a shame anyone would do that for any reason. He definitely needs to be held accountable and I don't blame companies for not wanting to work with him in the future. However, I also read of his brain injury. I can't help but think that contributed to his actions. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not going to sit here and say he should never be held responsible due to his health issue, but I can't say I hate the guy. I really hope he gets better, stays away from excessive alcohol use and can be a successful. 

Edit: These are my opinions based on what I've read. I'm not TJ's therapist or publicist, and I can't change the mental health laws to lock him up until his death. &&Have fun at your midnight screening of Blade 2 TJ.&&TIL: If a woman ignores you and you get angry at her for it, don't call in a false bomb threat in an attempt to get her into trouble with the law.&&God damm I thought he would play an important part by defusing a bomb in the final act of the film... oh wait&&TJ Miller does the most ""not returning"" of any actor i can recall. &&GET CHRISTOPHER PLUMBER TO REPLACE HIM &&At this point, he might as well take whatever money he has saved up and buy a house with lots of bedroom in Palo Alto. It will cost pretty penny (upwards of $5M).

Thoguht of showing up in a Pied Piper T-Shirt and asking him to sign my copy of The Emoji Movie or Yogi Bear to see if he flips out on me.&&And all of the incidents listed are after the production of Deadpool.&&I'm looking forward to a few decades from now when TJ Miller makes a comeback in some brilliant, thoughtful indie film winning tons of awards that leverages his reputation and history as a long washed-up comedian.&&You call in one little bomb threat and suddenly you're a ""terrorist."" &&And his character isn't relevant to X-Force to begin with, so regardless of all that, nobody should be surprised.&&I had no idea about that bomb threat, what the fuck.&&He saw a slippery slope and decided to grab a sled&&What did he do?&&He slid down the shit rope Rand&&Does he have any range?  I just feel like I'm watching Ehrlich cosplaying throughout all his roles.

I know you can get pretty far playing one character if you're a comic actor, but sheesh&&He was totally going to come out of the sexual assault allegations pretty clean since they were only by one person, made once, and there seemed to be some dubiousness behind the claims.  It was enough for people to not really pick up on it when they were made...and then he called in a fake bomb threat.

It's like he got mad that he dodged a bullet so he shot himself in the career.  What a dummy. &&I mean, he's still a somewhat successful touring comedian if his sold out shows are to believed. &&In all fairness ive heard him say he never wanted to be an actor on several occasions, he just wanted to do standup.&&Pretty sad. It's clear he uses substances to medicate his mental health issues. Something I used to do, so I can relate. &&That would be fantastic!&&Re-cast Weasel with increasingly obvious different Hollywood 'Chris' actors, ending with Christina Hendricks.&&Or no Weasel in the next films.

How do I make this happen? &&Inspiring idea&&""LET'S GO CABLE, I'VE BEEN DRINKING GREEN TEA ALL GODDAMN DAY!!!""&&Tweet this to Reynolds right fucking now &&ayyy&&Both happened after The Emoji Movie. Coincidence? I think not.&&He wasn't ousted, he left. He wouldn't even film the first 3 episodes of season 5 they offered him to set-up his exit.&&On Nerdist podcast he said he was hyped to work with Spielberg and decided to leave HBO show.&&I’m pretty sure it was Marc Maron . TJ was talking a BIG game on that show about how he was about to take off into the stratosphere as an actor because of his relationship with Spielberg that developed during RP1 and it just really sounded like bullshit. I like TJ a lot and hopefully the dude can get his shit together and turn it around. 

Edit: It was the Nerdist podcast not Maron. 

Double Edit: or ID10T which is what the Nerdist is called now.&&It was on his last episode of The Nerdist or whatever the fuck it’s called now. At least that’s one of the places he talked about the Spielberg thing. He for sure had an air of “I decided to let Silicon Valley find out what it could be without me” during that whole press tour, but I didn’t feel like he was harshing on HBO. 

FWIW I always felt like he was a one-trick pony and I say good on him for milking the tits off of that pony while he had the chance.&&Robert Downey Jr was *super talented* and troubled. While I hope TJ gets any help he needs, his talent likely won't warrant anyone commiting themselves to his reclamation project. &&>what Robert Downey Jr. did to rebuild his career after Ally McBeal

You just reminded me that I need to go back and watch [RDJ's episode of Ally McBeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO_sakIdUjw). I had such a big crush on him back then.&&I agree; however, he's nowhere near as talented as RDJ. That said, he can bounce back,....but (without the inherent skills and screen presence that RDJ has) it won't be easy.&&I imagine part of it is due to him having a part of his brain removed. Kind of hard to rehab from personality changes due to brain surgery. I hope the guy can recover, but it might just not be possible.&&TJ is nowhere near as talented as RDJ, nor has he ever really endeared himself with a magical piece of work like RDJ did with *Chaplin*. Also, RDJ was only self-destructive.&&Hell, slightly off topic, but Robert Downey Jr. is still persona non grata in some places. Despite how he's turned things around and become a massive success again, he's not welcome in Japan because of how they see substance abuse. You became less than human over there if you do that. So, he's still paying in ways he probably never expected.&&RDJ was/can still be a great actor. TJ is not even that good at his first job (comedian). &&[deleted]&&That would be awesome.&&Or johnny Knoxville. Would like to see that guy get some work&&Don Cheadle always plays a forgettable character, it could work, nobody would notice.&&‘Look, it’s me, I’m here, deal with it. Let’s move on.’&&The next Mission Impossible should be Tom Cruise helping him get his career back. &&That actually seems like something he'd do for fun.&&I think Ryan Reynolds can have good chemistry with most people in general.&&I literally have no idea what's happening? What TJ miller down to deserve all this?

&&Yeah I think he needs some help, not sure if its drugs or alcohol but the bomb scare incident and whatever punishment he gets from that should be a wake up call for him to get help. &&I saw that episode. It was so cringey. Also didn't really shock me at all given what I've seen him do before. He never seemed that funny to me.&&Was that the same time Oliver Stone was on and stating that Vladimir Putin did nothing wrong and stated that they didn't meddle in the election? If that was... Stephen Colbert had a fucking terrible night.&&Ironic that david spade was the one who said that.&&If this is the way they write out his character for future films, I’d totally be fine with that.&&They can't not make a Becky reference in that case.&&Danny McBride would actually be funnier anyway.&&They probably won't even make a three.

Why would they?

You stop at two, you killed it.&&Can confirm, still around.

Only sold 2 memory cards so far today... but we are still around.&&Aviato &&*Aviato&&And all of the incidents that led to him being written out of Silicon Valley&&Before and after, he assaulted an uber/taxi driver just because they were a Trump Supporter and then the latest one of him being a dumbass and calling in a ""bomb threat"" on a train heading towards DC because he had an argument with a lady on the train.

Dude is a total jackass, glad he's finally facing the consequences of his actions.&&Or as Ironman....&&more like they will find him in a decade in some back alley of Beverly Hills attempting to reenter the atmosphere while piloting a refrigerator box &&Back in the 10s, I was in a very famous TV show ...
I'm TJ the Miller, TJ the Miller don't act like you don't know&&!remindme 23 years&&the calling in a fake bomb threat on an airline carries some serious prison time &&I want some real life opportunities to use this quote.&&I mean even Danny Brown, a rapper who ran a crack house and then went to prison, says when he hangs out with Tj Miller he has to take a back seat and see where the night goes because he’s crazy.

Dude has great moments in the first movie...&&He was pretty different in Cloverfield, but that was before he had established the Ehrlich persona.&&Ryan Reynolds has been playing Van Wilder since 2002.&&Cloverfield is the only thing I've seen him in where it felt like he was playing a real person. Of course this was before I had any idea who he was and because of his role in the film couldn't even pick him out of a lineup.&&>there seemed to be some dubiousness behind the claims

it's so crazy how this always gets said. the only basis for this is that the accused said the accusations were made up. I don't know what happened, but the accusations aren't dubious.

In reality they wanted to give him a smaller side role and he was having problems with the other cast members so when he said he'd rather leave than have a smaller role they gave him an out. &&Both also happened after 9/11 - I blame the terrorists&&You only peak once.&&Read an article saying he would no show, show up late or show up drunk/high to filming. Seems more likely he was ousted but everyone made it seem like an amicable parting.&&He was ousted and then left. Making it seem like you left on your own terms is pretty common.&&...no shit he would say that. Would he really say, I WAS A HUGE ASSHOLE&&[deleted]&&I mean, he's cool but he's not leading man material. &&That sounds about right. I was confusing it with his appearance on You Made it Weird, years ago. That was the time he used the format to apologize to Michael Bay for comparing him to Hitler.&&Right. People forget that RDJ was nominated for an Academy Award prior everything going downhill. &&He is more likely to be an Artie Lange. Tons of legal issues and drug addiction, will be lucky to land on his feet making ends meat while still having some sort of job in the entertainment industry instead of working a ""real"" job. 

But he doesnt have the talent to make a RDJ comeback. &&Well shit, *Ally McBeal*. Now there's a thing I haven't thought about much in about 15 years.

The thing I remember the most is how she got stuck in the toilet that one time.

Edit: And how Lucy Liu would say: ""No, you don't pronounce my name *this* way. You pronounce my name **this** way.""&&Even when RDJ was using, he was adored...the issue was that he was such a risk to productions. Hell, I just read that Sean Penn kicked his door down right after the naked intruder incident to get him to rehab. TJ Miller seems to have pissed off people all over the entertainment business. &&Yeah, I don't know. In order to have a comeback I feel like you need to have people that actually want you to comeback. In a couple years from now is the comedy landscape going to feel like there is a void in it because TJ Miller isn't there? I somehow doubt it.&&Yeah RDJ was an Oscar nominee.   TJ Miller is the guy you get when you can't afford Seth Rogan&&Indeed I also read he has part of his brain missing&&But he made the comeback of comebacks ... like everyone wanted him to succeed but he kept continually screwing up.  He got clean and showed people he was clean, he was easy to work with and that he could be trusted again.  

Weirdly he owes Mel Gibson for the beginning of it ... Mel helped get him on board for ""The Singing Detective"" and that film showed he could get through a production and not be a fuck up.&&Totally forgot about Heigl. After she left the doctor show (forget which one) on bad terms shes still landed movie roles for a while circa 2007 to 2011 or so. Maybe they thought the TV thing was just a fluke and she wouldnt repeat the behavior. But then when she shat on her own movies as well it was clear she was just kind of a bitch and Hollywood was done with her. 

I knew it was over when she criticized *Knocked Up*. &&Dude torched his own career, he was a C list actor who wanted to be A list, he might have been successful if he didn't end up stealing people's shit and then trying to play it off like he was just joking the whole time &&Ahh Heigl. Last thing I saw her in was a fucking cat litter commercial, glad to see she ate some serious humble pie.&&Yeah, I miss Knoxville &&Johnny Knoxville is literally weasel from the comics. Exact same look.&&[deleted]&&I keep seeing terrible movies with Reynolds in them, in every single one he is charismatic and has great chemistry with everyone. He's a good actor.&&As a heterosexual male, I'd offer to test this hypothesis&&A couple of things. He assaulted an Uber driver over an argument about Trump, sexual abuse claims were made against him by an ex and he made a false bomb threat call to authorities while he was intoxicated on a train. 

All of this has happened since 2016.

EDIT: I'll add that the sexual abuse claims were unfounded, but the media coverage did still have a negative impact on his public image.&&There might be drugs or alcohol... but he literally had part of his brain removed.&&Still by far the worst job I've ever had.

He left way prior to all of this shit happening and it seemed like he had a legit career trajectory. He was in Deadpool, had been in transformers. Unfortunately now he's fucked and he can't even rely on SV money to fall back on. &&Errrrlik Bachman is ded. He a fat pig. &&oh so he's really not coming back from China then? I figured he was gonna show up again at some point in the season&&He had brain surgery to remove a small piece of his brain in the impulse part of his brain. I think it's more complicated than that.

Edit: apparently it was to remove avein or something on his brain, but it's claimed it's been tough on him. Also remembering he's on MULTIPLE psych meds.

Edit Edit: We know who's TJ. We know Where's TJ. Now me must do one better and know why is TJ.&&Let's meet halfway and have him voice Beta Ray Bill&&Walks into an Avengers meeting...

I love Danny Brown stories!&&If you commit a crime because your neurosurgeon fucked up and left you without impulse control, who's morally at fault? Genuine question.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppkcyMUYKME&&I just saw him do stand up last night. I’d never seen any of his stand up before but he spent an odd amount of time philosophizing about the benefits of suicide. I mean, I agreed with him, but there wasn’t really any humor involved in it other than the absurdity of talking about it during a comedy show. &&Yeah, that was a really weird move.&&Didn’t he have brain damage of some sort before this behavior?&&Heh.... BIG..... HEAAAAD.&&I submit that scene as the funniest thing on TV in the last decade.

When it happened, I made a very loud involuntary noise that wasn't even really a laugh, I've never had a reaction like that before to anything, but safe to say I lost it.&&Wow&&From what I’ve read it was also due to creative differences and his work ethic&&You have merely adapted the liquor&&So...like Kevin Hart.&&I'd love that. Deadpool quickly needs a new buddy so he chooses him.&&I hated him with a passion in Cloverfield. My favorite part of the movie was him getting eaten.&&> Van Wilder since 2002

There's always got to be that veil of obscurity so people can continue liking the accused. &&I thought he only bombed&&Oh shit, for real? That's brutal. Brains are scary things, man. &&On today’s episode of reddit writes Deadpool...&&Like the end scenes in 22 Jump Street where they switch Jonah Hill for Seth Rogen quickly and when he comes back “what contract dispute?”

Except in this version it’s not a contract dispute, it’s just a career free fall. &&/r/deadpoolshould &&Written by Tommy Wiseau&&Fucking terrible lmao&&God you're bad at this&&Weasel can't be self-aware, only Deadpool.&&Like even at one point during different shots in the same scene. He's Christopher Walken. Then he's Chris Cooper. Then he's Christoph Waltz. Then he's Chris Rock. All in the same scene.&&He has to call pine ""kirk"" though.. &&He could still join Hydra or be ex Hydra. If I recall correctly, Hydra Bob hadn't been in Hydra long and most of his training consisted of ways to run away from Wolverine.
&&What are you talking about? What contract dispute? &&say no more, fam&&***aight***&&What? Seriously?&&The first thing I thought when Pratt was cast as Star Lord: Well, his marriage is over.
There was no way it would survive such a radical change in stardom.&&I don't usually give a shit about celebrity divorces or whatever but that news legit made me go ""aw..""&&Nah pretty sure that was passengers.&&Maybe he's just a great method actor who's still in character of 'Meh'. &&It'd be hilarious if that film turned out to have been cursed by the ghost of, I don't know, Roger Ebert. And everyone who participated has their careers take a tumble as a result.

(Everyone except Patrick Stewart, of course. Gonna take more than a curse to take down Stewart.)&&I think he got a bunch of shit for it and then actually tried to defend the movie. Maybe the gate sent him over the edge&&Well it had peaked, that is at least true.&&But it also happened after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Coincidence?&&He was very close to his ehlrich character &&[deleted]&&Didn't he win best actor for Chaplin&&I'm all about Single Female Lawyer. &&All I remember is a dancing baby&&Man, when Sean fucking Penn kicks your door in and says ""you need rehab,"" I have to imagine you don't even say anything, you just pack a couple shirts and go.&&> he was such a risk to productions

It's the Lindsay Lohan problem.  Hollywood will give you a ton of opportunities if they want to, but if you become uninsurable no one is going to touch you.  Last thing producers need is a multi-million dollar production being halted because you got arrested or OD'd the night before while partying.&&That is an important part.  Downy had folks like Mel Gibson willing to go to bat for him in the industry.&&Yeah, RDJ was using drugs and it led to his downward spiral, but people still loved him. It was just that he caused insurance problems, and he would be so erratic it was costing too much money. Plus, RDJ is just immensely talented and charming. The dude carried the Marvel cinematic universe and is THE reason it is a multi-billion-dollar behemoth. Early on people didn't really give a shit about the other movies (Hulk sucked, Thor sucked, Captain America was alright) - they just wanted more RDJ as Tony Stark.

TJ Miller on the other hand just seems like he's a straight up asshole, *on top of* having those same problems (he reportedly would show up drunk or late or not at all to work on Silicon Valley).&&[Simpsons clip from when RDJ was at that point](https://youtu.be/UhjHVQsJOlo).&&I’d just love to know what went into making Heigl turn out the way she did. So baffled by her sheer lack of self awareness mixed with the most toxic of snobbery. Just.

Didn't know this&&As a geek who grew up in Radio Shacks, this and its fate makes me irrationally sad. &&I actually did well working at RatShack in high school. My store was in a strip mall like half mile from the hood. So we frequently had “undesirable types” buying phones with wads of cash. I don’t recall ever missing a quota. This was circa 2004 so the hot phone was one of those first flip phones with video recording. I was somehow top 10 in sales for the region and got invited to some meeting. Many pissed stares from the lifers when they saw 17 year old me who worked only after school and weekends. Hated selling warranties but cleaned up with them anyway. &&sounds like a pretty cool gig.. sans the write ups&&A big fan of what? Polio? A nice piece of fish?Deviled eggs as an entre? Segregated water fountains? Liking Ike? &&My Aviato?

holy shit I love silicon valley&&According to them, he would show up late or drunk half the time.&&He left to show off his acting chops in the masterpiece of our time, The Emoji Movie&&""I didn't get fired, I wanted to leave""

--most people who are fired.&&I read an interview from Mike Judge about it.  He basically said that he could just tell his heart wasn't in it anymore, and his attitude had changed considerably.&&he was right about it being formulaic though. The way everything gets fixed by the end of each episode makes it Entourage for nerds.&&He was in Ready Player One&&No, he left as his behavior became more erratic. He freaked the fuck out on the cast for not donating the max amount to Hillary Clinton and then attacked a guy over politics.  He's slowly been devolving into worse and worse behavior.  He's had brain issues in the past and I think they are back.&&aside from his residuals, you mean.&&[deleted]&&That... would definitely change things.&&*thinking* about calling a bomb threat is totally normal. *actually calling* a bomb threat is not. Makes sense if he really lost his impulse control

Edit: I mean like a momentary/intrusive kind of thought&&It wasn't to remove a piece of his brain, he had a blood vessel malformation where a artery is connecting directly into a vein instead of passing through capillaries first, denying proper blood flow to the area, and it has an increased chance of it bursting as well. 

They removed the malformed section of blood vessel, and typically no brain matter is typically removed or targeted in the surgery. &&Did that guy who promised to eat his own shit if Beta Ray Bill wasn't in Thor Ragnarok ever show up again?

I was mistaken. After finding the post he said he would eat a horses dick, not, in fact, his own shit. &&He knows who he is. He's a dude playin a dude disguised as another dude.&&Not anymore&&Oh I understand that part, I’m an alcoholic myself. I hope the dude gets the help he needs sincerely. I am a pass out drunk though, no hitting or rapey stuff from me.&&There's a radiolab episode that covers this, well worth a listen.

https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/317627-fault-line/&&[deleted]&&This is why some people get institutionalization instead of prison time. People seem to think ""insanity"" as a defense gets you free. It doesn't: it often gets you institutionalized until you're cured, which might be never.&&The surgeon didn't fuck up, its a side effect of having a portion of your brain removed which was the only way to remove the tumor. &&Apparently he drunkenly met some random woman on a train, she didn't like him, so he called the FBI, from the train, and told them that a woman matching her description had a bomb. Then he tried sneaking away at the next stop.

What the hell TJ?&&Yeah, he had surgery to remove a tumor. I honestly think there is a correlation between the two.&&He had a tumor in his brain that was removed via surgery years ago. A portion of his frontal lobe had to be removed, and the surgery has something like a 10% mortality rate and can cause a change in personality.

So the question is, was TJ Miller always an asshole, or did his behavior change as a result of this surgery? Judging by the stories told about him, it seems like he was just always an asshole.&&That scene reaffirmed for me how much it actually fuckin hurts when beer enters the sinuses&&When you drink against the grain of the liquor, you lose.&&Exactly like Kevin Hart.&&Kevin Hart has a work ethic and a general good attitude. This dude lucked into a main role or two, made some awful choices, and has a clear douchebag vibe about him.&&He forces his old romantic rival that he had in the trunk to drive the Taxi now, right?&&Thank you for putting the entire title of the show that first season. I felt it went slightly downhill after they dropped the pizza place, But then dipped upwards once Nathan Fillion join the cast.

 It was a cheesy little show, but damn I miss it.&&It's funny how none of the articles written about TJ Miller ever mention that fact.&&Yeah, was his prefrontal cortex I believe, which is largely where your judgement and impulse control is&&4th wall break? *check*

Humorless punchline? *check*

Completely contrived and unoriginal? *check*&&I swear each suggestion is worse than the last

You could extend the curse to them too .  I just had to Google their relationship and am frightened for what my news feed will be from now on, but yes, the timeline works.&&Yeah, kind thought the same thing. Also, when he did interviews saying how his wife actually didn't really dig him being in such better shape. Just seemed like 2 people going in different directions in life.&&Well I feel bad about it but I thought just the same thing. &&The Passengers movie I believe is the one that really did it, right?&&[deleted]&&He's a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude

&&The only reason I watched the emoji movie was because Patrick Stewart is a peice of shit. &&Nothing can take down Patrick Stewart.

TJ Miller just became the battlefield.&&From what I've read, Ehrlich was TJ Miller on Good Behavior&&He was nominated but lost to Pacino for Scent of a Woman if Im not mistaken. &&Fighting for her client.&&Its like when John Belushi told Carrie Fischer she was doing too much cocaine on the set of ""The Blues Brothers.""  John Belushi was to cocaine what Mr Lahey from the ""Trailer Park Boys"" was to liquor.

The movie was like mostly finished voice wise untill he passed.&&> they just wanted more RDJ as Tony Stark.

And he had to fight for that role.  He was only paid $500,000 for the initial Iron Man film, and he was only casted after John Favreau fought for him after interviewing him and initially thinking he wouldn't be a good fit.  Yes RDJ gets paid a lot for the role now, but initially he wasn't.  Terrence Howard, for example, was paid $3.5 million for that film by comparison.  &&I think she believed, prematurely, that she had achieved Sandra Bullock untouchable star status or something, and could say anything. 

Maybe she would have in another 5 or 10 years but she wasn't there yet. So she destroyed herself. 

&&Green Lantern for starters.&&Yeah, trial is still ongoing.&&Back in 2010. Had a brain tumor, had part of his brain removed. He talks about it in a 15 minute set somewhere. 

The Surgeon told him he might change his personality, mood swings, etc, etc.&&Blame it on the owner tryna ride the cell phone hype. So many people come into my work for basic electrical components, can't get them anywhere besides online around here if you're not an electronics contractor.

Edit: I would like to note I live in the Bay Area of California (SF/SV/Oakland) So being such a hotbed for tech, its weird how you can't find any storefront electronics stores here.&&Senior Citizens discounts at Perkins family restaurants? Loose lips and the ships that are sunk by them?&&Is there another *Aviato*?&&Is there any other Aviato?

Me too, it just keeps getting better!&&Sounds like Erlich to me.&&Sounds about right. Was down in the French quarter in NO  and a friend spotted him. He had a shiner on his face/eye that looked pretty fresh and he was with another dude who looked pretty unkempt. They had a couple of bags of take out and looked pretty drunk. It was 11am. This was last April. &&sounds like dedicated method acting&&I'd probably take a few million dollars in exchange for acting in a culturally repugnant movie.&&Ironically that’s an incredibly Erlich-esque move&&I totally agree with you, I'm just referring to interviews from the cast and Mike Judge that talked about how Miller decided to leave (obviously he was fucking up on set and pissing a lot of people off and would have been written off had he stayed) but according to Mike Judge, they offered to have Miller come back for a few episodes season 5 to wrap up his story but TJ Miller refused.&&No its because Jian Yang actually killed him&&Which is a bummer. He acted as a sort of anchor for that show. Now it is just going to be a rich person tech drama. Instead of a drunk and stoned rich person tech drama. &&It sounds to me like a toxic mix of depression & anxiety. Yano they say to look out for signs of people pushing their friends away? Well it’s just like that. It’s with bad attitudes and general bad behavior as well as thinking your opinion is the right opinion.

The worlds a horrible place and alcohol definitely isn’t helping him. He needs serious rehabilitation, just fuck off for 6 months and be cared for and I guarantee he’d be back on top form&&[deleted]&&That was the weirdest interview I've ever read and I'm a longtime fan of Eric andre. This guy really said ""kids don't deserve to laugh as much as adults because they're still in fantasy land, they aren't aware of their own mortality.""  Wtf?  

Also apparently he thinks the emoji movie was a feminist film because a character breaks a glass ceiling. &&Yeah, it's actually kinda sad. The guy must know that a part of himself was removed. His behaviour is really impulsive, I wonder if he is able to understand the results of his actions in the moment.
Edit I found the stand up set where he talks about it.
https://youtu.be/Kf9N5AWprG8 it's actually pretty funny as well&&Dammit.

Maybe the internet can help. John Dies at The End used to lead to a blog from the characters, in which John was drawing comics.

One of the comics is about ""Dick Sniper!"" A sniper so good he can shoot the impulse control part of your brain turning the target into a complete asshole that no one can tolerate.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? That comic would be perfect here.&&He's also on anti-manic meds. Dude is interesting for sure.&&I don't think enough people in this thread understand: *he had to have part of his brain removed; particularly the impulse related area*&&> thinking about calling a bomb threat is totally normal

Can confirm, have contemplated many ways to get out of work.

&&Beta ray bill was kind of in the movie. His head was shown on the Granmasters palace. &&He saw a slippery slope and decided to grab a sled. &&One of my favorite radiolab episodes, recommend this so hard &&Was about to post this. It's a really good way to start thinking about free will and whether or not it truly exists. &&> Then he tried sneaking away at the next stop.

Actually, he was on a different train when he called in the bomb threat I believe. He was thrown off the train for being belligerently drunk. Then he got arrested at the airport later after they investigated the situation.&&What the..  that's.. pretty pathetic. Damn shame, really enjoyed his character on SV and in the last Deadpool movie. &&Especially if the tumor was in the prefrontal cortex, you can get massive personality changes from brain tumors. This is the part of the brain that controls judgement and personality. There is a case where a normal person got a tumor, started downloading child porn, got the tumor removed, and then went back to normal. And of course the shooter at The University of Texas at Austin had a brain tumor.

And I just looked it up. He had a golf ball sized tumor removed from his frontal lobe back in 2010. So it fits.

Or he could just be an asshole.&&A correlation like ""the surgery affected his behavior"",
 or a correlation like [""pool drownings and Nicolas Cage films""](https://i.imgur.com/aC3vBoR.jpg)?&&He might've always been a run-of-the-mill asshole, but I feel like reporting a random woman for a bomb threat is above and beyond that, and might indicate a change in personality. &&[deleted]&&He also cheated on his pregnant wife.&&Then RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch say ""no shit sherlock"" 😂😂😂😂&&Truly, a fifth sense for comedy.

Edit: Awww, parent comment removed ""3rd wall break"".&&Also wtf is up with Weasel’s dialogue

I’m amazed people call that trash humor&&Don't forget the always sunny episodes&&Honestly I think it's a good idea poorly executed by a redditor. Recasting between superhero movie sequels has happened a lot so Deadpool could definitely have fun with that idea seeing as its basically satire of modern tropes in comic book films.&&Saw one in a discussion of Civil War where they had Deadpool enter the airport scene, make back to back god awful 4th wall breaking jokes about Spider-Man, and then leave.

Don't know anything about it, but that could be what he is referring to.

Whether or not it was true, I'm sure the rumour itself didn't do the marriage any favors&&He loves roles like that. He's got all kinds of range.

Argh. &&I think it's crazy, Radio Shack could have been a hub for Makers today, with the rise of 3d printing and DIY hobbyists. I mean, that's how I remember them, soldering irons, shit like that.   
But, they're just dead dead now&&Frys 
&&In Australia we had a shop called ""Dick Smith Electronics"" which stocked a lot of the Tandy/Radioshack Type stuff.     It was by no means a booming business, But they kept the stores small and you'd usually be able to find one nearby.   They did their job as a hobby electronics store.     Then they got bought out by Woolworths and then converted into a consumer electronics chain(Tvs, computers, phones, consoles),   completely abandoning their previously successful monopoly.    They folded in 2016.

Meanwhile their much smaller competitor ""Jaycar"" has all but completely moved to fill the gap, and seem to be doing quite good for themselves..

I completely understand how a low product margin combined with low turn around could cripple a business, hence the move to consumer electronics,  but I think the secret to making it work is by...

1. Leasing a smaller,  less desirable space,  or simply owning it.
2. Investing heavily on initial stock (if you dont have the specific resistor someone wants they'll never come back)
3.  Staff a single well paid employee for the price of 3 that actually knows what he's talking about.

4.  Stock Arduino/Raspberry Pi..

5.  Consider musicians and audio guys when stocking cables/adapters,  that shit is golden

Probably wishes he could stay on now.&&That's the best set of his I've seen. &&> I wonder if he is able to understand the results of his actions in the moment.

Thats Keanu Reeves alright.&&> The romantic crime thriller stars Keanu Reeves (The Matrix, John Wick) and Ana Ularu (Inferno, Emerald City), with supporting performances from Molly Ringwald (Riverdale, Jem and the Holograms) and Pasha Lychnikoff (Ray Donovan, Shameless).
> 
> Penned by Scott B. Smith from a story by Stephen Hamel and Smith, Siberia centers on Lucas Hill (Reeves), an American diamond trader who sells blue diamonds of dubious origin to buyers in Russia. As the deal quickly begins to disintegrate, he falls into an obsessive relationship with a Russian cafe owner (Ularu) in a small Siberian town while colliding with the treacherous world of the diamond trade.&&He's gonna straight up punch dudes dead for 30 minutes and credits.&&Russia is so in rn &&“You’ve seen Keanu fight Russians, now see him fight Russia herself”&&It's quite amazing how the legend who played, The One, has surpassed his own iconic status.

He's not afraid, defiant even. Reeves has shoulders shrugged, hands in pockets, chin down, I think that carries some nervousness, he has some fear. He's a merchant selling diamonds in Russia which is inherently dangerous - high risk high reward; he's not a warrior in this film. Their poses convey a different type of character if you ask me. Or maybe I just think too much...

I remember when that movie first came out, everyone thought it was going to suck because Cage had just done fucking Peggy Sue Got Married. Which was terrible. 

So everyone I knew waited to rent it when it came out on VHS. We thought it would probably also suck, but it turned out to be pure comedic genius. And endlessly quotable. My family still mentions something about stealing huggies or eating sand or getting your dip-tet once a month.

9 Hours?  Where can I get some of this mythical weed?&&Sources say there was no visible difference with McConaughey.&&Yeah, pretty sure Matthew knew it was real weed before even taking the first drag.  Nobody's going to mistake the smell of burning oregano with weed... let alone Matthew.  &&It was an accident.  Snoop just got within 10 feet of the fake weed and it was transmuted.&&[Similar thing happened to Mark Ruffalo apparently, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5HSo7V2EAg)&&Does anybody else cynically think all these kinds of ' movie set stories' are, if not totally fake, packaged by PR departments to make for good talk show stories to promote their movies?&&I'm sure the prop weed was real.&&""The next 9 hours were a lot of fun""

*9 hours*

What the f kind of weed is that?? I'm no expert, but I think you're just making shit up at this point.&&Sure when Snoop slips people drugs people think it's great, when I do it I get a five year sentence. &&I gotta say I can understand NOT being mad about this but I feel like this is not okay.&&""Oh you son of a a gun."" -Matthew McConaughey&&The FEDs raided the movie set and questioned the actors. The crew were flabbergasted by the findings that the weed was indeed real... all except a red glassy-eyed Snoop who sat in the corner with the largest shit-eating grin the FEDs had ever seen.&&If McConaughey doesn't smoke then this is kind of a dick move. Smoking today's weed let alone Snoops stash without being a regular smoker can send you into panic attack mode. I'm sure McConaughey was just alright alright alright though.&&Spoiler alert: the prop weed was already real weed. &&In other news, Snoop threw out a bag of real weed thinking it was prop weed. &&So, it’s like that Mark Ruffalo stage acting story, eh?

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/12/mark-ruffalo-joint-onstage/amp&&I know this is a marketing thing but i feel like thats a bit of a dick move.&&I know we're all laughing at this but please don't dose people without them knowing. &&so... matthew mcconaughey was gonna smoke prop weed? yeah this story has a lot of holes lol&&""Alright, alright, alri....why do I always say that? Isn't that weird?""&&*Fake* weed is the *real* devil's lettuce.&&alternative headline: ""coworker tricks another worker into doing drugs at work""&&Prop weed is still real weed they just buy it from high school dealers. &&Cute story, but even with weed being legal in Cali where this presumably took place wouldn't it be highly illegal to drug someone without their consent?&&On a real movie set this could cause delays and legal repercussions with the insurers stepping in to... oh wait, never mind, it's a Harmony Korine movie.&&Is this legal?&&Drugging people is not ok no matter if you’re famous for doing drugs or not.&&Of course it was less of a clandestine switcharoo, and more of a 'jesus walks in the room and all the water turns to wine' kind of deal.&&Holy shit the guy in the comments section of that article... Chill pill my friend&&Ermm... Sorry. Snoop just spiked someone with a psychoactive drug and we're all just. HAHAHA WHAT A LEGEND! Come on. &&Anyone but Snoop and it'd be a lawsuit instead of funny.&&[removed]&&I'm surprised they could wrap up production in reasonable time with those 2 lighting together. &&publicity obviously &&It would suck if he had to take a piss test after that.

Who would believe that? ""You see, the fake weed was switched for real weed. Honest.""&&We secretly switched his brand of weed Snoop Dog’s primo weed. Let’s find out what happens...&&All rightorightoright&&Friend of mine works in the music industry, he has never smoked weed, but said he definitely got a contact high on snoops tour bus. &&For some reason, when I first read this headline I thought it said Scooby Doo instead of Snoop Dogg and thought that maybe I was the one on hallucinogens.&&Weed has an extremely distinct odor. Anyone who cant immediately tell it’s not oregano is either stupid AF or this post was designed purely to get people watching this POS film. &&Thats a shitty thing to do&&This is totally not a cool or funny thing to do.&&Isn't this illegal?&&That's a crime and not funny. &&Lmao since when was drugging someone funny? Like I get Matt probably didn't care.. but still. Seems a weird thing to find funny, and be upvoted on reddit.&&How the fuck is everyone okay with this? Having been drugged nothing about it is okay, it is horrifying.&&Thats a real cunt move imo. Id be pissed if someone drugged me on purpose. Fuck that guy.&&I fucking love Harmony and haven’t even heard of this movie!!?! &&*Alright, alright, alright*&&Intentionally introducing a drug into another person without their consent is assault.&&That should be illegal.

Oh, turns out it is. But it's hilarious because it's Uncle Snoop.&&That's called *drugging someone*, to the layperson.&&And nobody noticed any difference.&&He looks like Fire Marshall Bill on the thumbnail. Cannot unsee&&Snoops a true pal &&>This is why no one likes you, Ray.

the comments on the article are gold.&&He got Snooped&&I went to the prop man to make sure I have the prop weed which is like crushed oregano,” McConaughey said. “[During filming], we pass back and forth and all of sudden at the end he goes, ‘Yo Moondog, that ain’t prop weed, that’s Snoop Weed.’ I was like, ‘Oh you son of a a gun.'”


What a Lad&&I don't know about you, but I think I'd be able to tell the difference between weed and oregano in a joint. I'm certain I'd know after one toke, instead of passing it back and forth until it's gone. This is just marketing bullshit.&&Unfortunately, Harmony Korine is to movies what Paul Walker was to driving fast.&&Hey man, you got a joint? Shhiiit. Be a lot cooler if you did. &&PROP WEED! I thought you were method McConaughey??&&If it was a working day, they maybe had to do multiple takes and kept fucking it up because they were all stoned but continued smoking the ""prop"" weed on every take.&&gotta remember it's snoops weed. I've head mortals can die from it&&Snoop's bud is supposedly legendary status among celebs. I wouldn't doubt it.&&Idk man if you smoke enough it can last you that, I still feel buzzed after sleeping when I've smoked a lot.
But then again I live in the Netherlands and most weed here is fire.&&right?&&Take an edible son&&Damn apparently I was 21 minutes late but my thoughts were this exactly. I can't say I've smoked every kind of weed, and by no means an expert, but that's not likely.&&Weed is amazing now. I've stayed high as balls for quite awhile off a little mango koosh bought legally.&&If you have a high tolerance, normal weed doesn't get you fucked up to that level. Snoop has a high tolerance so the weed he smokes is probably some potent shit.&&9 hour work days on set brah&&Be snoop dog and have excessive amounts of money to spend on incredibly expensive top shelf weed and have the connections to get that weed.&&If anyone has that kind of weed, it's Snoop and McConaughney&&you really think they stopped after the first one? haha, good one&&Things did seem *cooler* though.&&Ahhright.... Ahhright...Ahhright&&Except afterwards he never said alright on its own again&&For real. Matt knew there was bud in the room as soon as he opened the door.&&He might have already been too stoned to notice.&&Seriously. After the first hit you would know. Shitty fake movie story probably pushed by producers. &&The prop stuff smells way worse than the real thing.&&Matthew was probably the second expert on weed besides snoop. Can’t con a lifetime expert on weed. &&To be fair... Snoop probably normally reeks of weed. If you're sitting next to him you probably wouldn't even be able to smell out the actual weed lol. &&Also 9 hours is a crazy long high from one joint, right? Or is my tolerance that fucked.

Makes me think they filmed multiple shots *without* the prop weed. &&Also is secretly giving people drugs cool now?

I always thought slipping people around you drugs without their knowledge was fucked up.&&*sniffs* ""alright alright alright""&&Unfortunately Matthew later swapped what he thought was fake weed with stronger weed he stole from Snoop’s trailer.&&Snoop dog has a permanent weed aroma, it’s like a 40 meter radius around him. &&Actually there has been a trend in the last few decades or so to use props that smell real.  The thought process is that once smell-a-vision TVs become standard anything filmed with real smelling props won’t require as much work to rerelease.  Very forward thinking by the director.&&Alright alright alright. &&Back in my day a dime bag cost a.. wait no this is oregano woah. I'm going to need your plug this oregano is skunky.&&What is prop weed anyway? I hope they don't just put oregano into a joint. You have to actually smoke it don't you?&&So, you're saying he *can't* claim poisoning? :-)&&Alright, alright, alriight.&&Nobody is gonna inhale the smoke unless they know it's weed &&Alright alright&&Besides, Snoop Dogg. I mean, you know that guy's not going to smoke any of that fake shit.&&[https://media.giphy.com/media/Tys953lK8DM88/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/Tys953lK8DM88/giphy.gif)&&Apparently when he noticed he said ""you son of a gun""&&Yeah, i'm fairly certain he's said he enjoys a toke before. &&Fullweed Alchemist&&So Snoop is Weed Jesus?&&Reminded me of the [Epic Rap Battle](https://youtu.be/0kRAKXFrYQ4) he did&&Snoop has just found the only way to calm the Hulk.

She looks like the fake barbie lady &&Like matthew mcchonauoghhghay is NOT going to smell SNOOP’S weed? Cmon folks,,,,,&&9 hour weed high. Yes that's exactly what I think.&&Not on a Harmony Korine movie. &&>Does anybody else cynically think



  


Think? I am comfortably sure about it. &&Yeah, they've been pumping this bullshit into /r/movies a lot lately. There are plenty of gullible people to eat it up though, unsurprisingly.&&Real enough to last 9 hours...&&Probably just over exaggerating the fact that it was snoops weed.&&They probably had to do multiple takes &&Snoop's got a team of scientists working to make the best and most potent herb.  if you havent smoked in a while, that shit'll hit you like a ton of bricks
&&It's not cool, whoever does it.&&That was my initial thought. But people in the thread raise a good point. Anyone who smokes weed, or knows people who smoke weed, or has walked past strangers smoking weed is going to recognise the smell instantly. So the danger of the prank target getting high without their consent is pretty minuscule. &&This would be less funny if it was prop heroin being swapped out!&&It's absolutely not okay lol. It'd be one thing as a private prank with your friend but not while your working. and even in the former scenario I'd probably get really mad about that. &&Seeing as Snoop has it written into his contract that he will never smoke fake weed, I think this was just a story for the late night talk show circuit.&&its not okay&&It's between Snoop and McConaughey. In this scenario, it's okay. Probably welcomed. Now if I did this to my old and frail receptionist at work, it would be different. 

Gotta feel it out. &&It's definitely not OK if it's true as presented, you got someone high without them knowing, and when they were trying to work. Pretty fucked up. In real life though it seems likely that MM knew it was real weed the second he smelled it. If it even was a prank to begin with. He may have always been in on it.&&As Snoop do.&&Why are you capitalizing feds?&&> If McConaughey doesn’t smoke

LOL&&He smokes, or maybe did before the dad years.  He got busted naked playing bongos on a beach with weed, he's playing coy.  He could have said, *it'd been a while, I wasn't ready for that, but it was fun*.&&You should never give someone drugs without their consent. That’s just fucked up. &&Even if one is a regular smoker it's still a dick move. Some people need to be prepared before they fuck around with psychoactive substances.&&Yeah I know everyone's giggling about it, but it is kind of a breach of trust.&&Dick move and assault in some areas, I think it's assault if you slip someone Aspirin here in Germany.&&Even if he's smoking it's not OK to get somenone stoned without consent.&&[deleted]&&I used to smoke A LOT of weed (1/4 lb in 3 days myself), granted it was commercial.  But I quit 15 years ago due to paranoia. 
  
I usually take 1 hit a year and I'm always instantly remembered why I quit.  
  
A couple years ago someone gave me a chocolate chip cookie.  After I ate it, they started laughing their ass off and told me it was a high grade weed cookie.   
  
It was horrible.  Not fucking cool.

Dude definitely smoked some major weed.&&Yeah this would be my idea of hell&&if you do acid is it cool if I drop a couple tabs of acid in your drink without telling you?&&Spoiler? Maybe plot twist? &&Not at all.&&If this story was true and not just another PR thing because *""weed is cool""*, no.

After the first take the props dept was probably pissed off, and then the director or someone decided maybe they would get a better performance (especially from Snoop) if it was the real thing and let it happen. Possibly closed the set to minimal crew or let crew make the decision to step outside or not to respect union health and safety rules and so on.

But thats not as fun a story.&&Exactly what I was thinking. Except I wouldve used more commas. &&On set a single scene can take hours of filming.  If they kept smoking over and over while working on that scene for near to 9 hours it could have ended up as a 9 hour high&&Lots of takes, lots of tokes&&Except scenes usually require multiple takes, which is why in movies with breakfast they grab one bite and leave, so they don’t eat all the food and need to remake it.

Won't happen again.&&They probably just smoked together in the trailer. But when someone from the media asked, Mathew didn't want to just blantantly admit to smoking week so he was like, ""Snoop Dogg set me up."" But in light hearted friendly way since this seems like something Snoop could do. &&Might not take much note of the smell if you’re exposed to it regularly. Know I had a huge stoner phase where the smell didn’t phase me much and yet now that I’m not smoking I can identify the smell from a block and a half away. If this isn’t rediculous promotional material then only means that McConaughey smokes regularly on his off days. Otherwise, could have been using a vape on scene. Doubt that, though.&&I agree, but would almost classify this specific case as a practical joke among friends. As for it being during work, that it was asked if it was prop weed and the subject of the movie makes me think that the general tenor of the set makes a prank like this more acceptable. &&That is how a Snoop Dogg do.&&*[Say, man,...you got a joint?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS30OfLFbRM)*&&On a side note, dae notice once he started wearing a shirt he suddenly became a remarkable serious actor?

Sweet summer child... He regularly had the cops come out to tell him to quit getting baked because the nude bongo playing was keeping the neighbors up. And by regularly I mean nightly.

With Netflix pumping out all of this original content, I’m not going to care that I spent $10 a month, I’ll be waiting in anticipation for the next season of daredevil, or this new movie, or whatever.

Netflix doesn't exactly have a limitless catalog. By making quality original content (namely must see tv series) they entice audiences to stay subscribers. When a show takes over the internet (like stranger things) they get a bunch of new users. &&Netflix is in almost every country in the world.  There are 125 million Netflix subscribers.

But they're still racking up debt I believe - because they're building their own library of content they own in order to rely less on licencing content.  This will save them a ton of money over time.&&By driving up subscription numbers. They've taken out like 8 billion in debt to make new movies. This obv isn't including their yearly profit. &&It’s no secret that people are pulling their content from Netflix to begin their own streaming services. What Netflix was paying to license old content is likely being repurposed to fund new projects. Don’t look at it like a traditional movie trying to recoup its budget. Look at it like Netflix trying keep and expand their subscriptions. &&They have over a hundred million monthly subscribers. &&Cable companies are losing customers to Netflix in the millions, so they must be doing something right.&&They use select in-movie advertisements to help recoup some of the cost. Not 150m of cost, but any time you see a name-brand in one of their movies you can pretty much guarantee they paid netflix something to have it there. &&In 2017, netflix had a net income of $560 million on revenues of $11.7 billion. That’s net of interest on debt of $238 million. They have nearly $3 billion in cash. While their debt seems high on paper, the business is healthy and likely to remain so as long as content maintains and grows subscriptions.

This is a much more viable long term business than was the previous rental and content distribution business, which was subject to massive and unpredictable content costs, which in turn led to unpredictable margins and loss of subscribers.

In short: their subscriptions are fully supporting their investment in new content as their revenue and income grow steadily and consistently year over year. With each passing year, their IP asset value grows, which can be monetized to varying degrees almost indefinitely.&&You don’t necessarily have to make money every single quarter. For a tech stock, often more important to show investors the potential for growth so they’re excited about Netflix’s future (buy and hold stock)

It’s all about setting expectations and exceeding them. Apple would make billions in a quarter and still lose value in their stock because they didn’t exceed expectations.

&&I read this morning they have 125 million subscribers. Netflix is $10 a month right? That's 1.25 billion per month they make.&&Buying versus renting. Netflix is buying material it will own instead of renting the right to show other material. Ownership is important.

I've actually tried to watch some of them recently and man, it's just a heap. Even the ones that I SHOULD really enjoy. I loved Workaholics and was pumped to watch Game Over, Man but that movie sucked hard. It didn't even have to be good and I still would have enjoyed it, but instead it was a pile.&&They also don’t have to keep spending money like they do with original content. The Office continually costs Netflix money. But they’ll never have to pay for Stranger Things again after  its finished. &&Not to mention all the merchandising $$ they get from shows such as Stranger Things&&> This will save them a ton of money over time.

Probably, but maybe not. The nature of content is changing. 20 years ago you could mostly keep up with the big-name content, there wasn't a massive amount of it. These days that's impossible, there's a ton of big-name content being produced, there just aren't enough hours in a day to keep up.

This isn't a problem per se, but it changes the game. Everyone can kind of carve out a more niche corner of content to watch. That means less overlap with other people, and the amount of new content being created is so large that it's not like the 90's where you'd keep movies on VHS and rewatch them when you were bored.

So, will anyone be watching the movies Netflix is making today, in 5 years? One of the draws of them having a back catalog of older movies (which has been eroded due to content deals) was that people could watch movies they were nostalgic for, ones that you couldn't easily rent and didn't have enough pull to find online and buy and ship. Is anyone going to be nostalgic for the current breed of Netflix movies when there's so much new content being created, and there's going to be less nostalgic overlap. When there's a flood of content it's not going to be ""Hey, remember that movie XYZ, one of only like 50 big name movies that came out in 1996?""

Directors like Scorsese will bemoan that we're creating throwaway content and devaluing the art, and in a lot of cases we probably are, but it'll be interesting how this changes the economics of it all. In theater movies still make economic sense with the massive budgets due to their limited quantity and quantifiable return.&&Debt's not bad if it's properly leveraged.

Martin Scorsese directing. Period costumes. Things like that add up.&&Didn't Scorsese direct the first episode of Boardwalk Empire which was one of the most expensive television episodes ever made?&&Digital de-aging. The budget was 100 million when it was still at Paramount, who dropped it when it shifted to 125. Reports are saying that post-production has been pretty brutal working with the CG tech, and that it is likely going to cost Netflix north of 150 million when all is said and done, which is absolutely preposterous for a gangster movie.&&They actually filmed a scene from this on my block. And, as far as I can tell from watching on my balcony - it was a very minor scene. Just a bunch of cars driving down 2 or 3 blocks. Then they would have them all drive in reverse back to their original spots and do it again. For that one little scene - they changed our entire apartment entry way to be more period specific, they had extras walking down the street dressed to that time period, they had probably 30 cars. I even watched them change all of the street signs and street lights - taking out the LED bulbs for whatever was more time specific. To say nothing about the cost of shutting down a Manhattan Street for the better part of a day/evening (even if we don't live on a very busy street). 

So I can see how the budget can add up quickly when doing period pieces like this. &&To pay the elderly cast and their assistants &&They are de-aging Pacino, De Niro and Pesci which I assume is going to take a lot of money for CGI&&Heavy Hollywood hitters. Pacino, Joe Pesci, De Niro and other old timers. Plus de-aging the actors. This is going to be Pacino, Pesci, and De Niro final movie as well.&&Do you see the cast of this movie? Those people are not cheap.&&Period makes it inherently more expensive than contemporary.

Big cast likely working for their full quotes, maybe more.

Netflix paying a premium to get a ""film legend"" to do a non-theatrical.

Since there is no theatrical all the above the line costs are top dollar (rights, director, producers, writer). 

Shooting in NY and not Canada, or Hungary, or wherever and cheating it for NY, costs a lot.

VFX (some of that for period reasons, some for de-aging, and then all the little stuff that no one would ever realize is digital)

Scorsese is an auteur, uncompromising in his vision which means it can cost a lot more for all the crew and producers to ultimately execute his vision. Example: instead of the picture car guy having a conversation with the director and showing him five options for the lead character's car, there are a dozen meetings over several weeks, the picture car guy has to hire three more guys to scour the entire North East seaboard to fins just the right car. That's the general kind of thing that is not uncommon on films by guys like Scorsese, Malick, Mann, Iñárritu... &&Theres a fuck load of CGI. &&They are digitally de-aging DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, keitel and maybe a few more. &&Period pieces are expensive.&&Post production technology to de-age De Niro, Pacino and Pesci. &&look at that fucking cast man&&Probably paying the actors takes off most that budget.&&[deleted]&&> - what the hell does it need a blockbuster tentpole budget for?

I think for a while in the comics Bruce Wayne wants The Batman to continue on without him when he dies or whatever, that's where The Batman myth would scare criminals, he wouldn't die.

Many major entertainment companies want their own flavor of Netflix instead. It's cable TV all over again. &&It's because studios don't want to sell rights to Netflix anymore.

TV studios either own part of an existing streaming site (like Hulu) or they are planning to build their own site like the Disney specific site slated for 2019: http://deadline.com/2018/02/disney-streaming-service-launch-slate-star-wars-marvel-1202281846/

Netflix has to create their own content as movie/TV companies now want to get into the streaming business.
&&they haven't chosen this route. If they had their way everyone would sell them their movies and shows all the time. The issue is every studio and broadcast channel now wants their own streaming service. its why a lot leave Netflix for hulu&&HBO's been doing this same thing for a long time and that's also just $10-15 a month. For instance [the final season of Sopranos cost about $83 million](https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-an-average-episode-of-the-Sopranos-cost-to-make).

It's also worth remembering that original content also improves their bargaining position when it comes to buying the rights to other movies. Fox can threaten to pull all of Die Hard if Netflix doesn't hit the price point they want but if Netflix has a bunch of other content they can depend on being there that's a lot less scary for them. It's also worth bringing up that if someone were to start a competing streaming service and get more rights to more movies then Netflix could become seen as that service that has hardly anything on it. As opposed to ""This service has more movie rights but they don't have any of the Netflix programming that I like.""

etc, etc. There's just a lot of upside to doing original content.&&I imagine the rights to movies are getting more and more expensive as studios move their content to their own streaming platforms. &&Buying the rights to movies is probably more expensive then making your own. Plus with more and more companies starting their own streaming service, you can't just wait around and but other people's content because they're going to stop selling it and stream it themselves. If Netflix could that'd load up their catalog with all the most popular movie and shows, they can't so they're doing the next best thing. &&Not everyone is paying $10 a month. I've got the UHD plan for $14 a month. &&They literally have no choice. All the people who used to license them content are starting their own services.

Netflix HAS to make their own content before they lose the rights to all the other content. &&
Buying the rights to movies is a tricky dance. Picking them up at film festivals is one thing, but you usually don't get options for many mainstream draws, whether they're big budget action flicks or comedies for general audiences.

Their previous model was licensing content that everyone believed had no value on digital platforms, but they've all wisened up, and will continue to pull content (except for the lesser distributors and networks that get a boost from streaming deals), leaving Netflix with nothing.

This is really the only option they've got, otherwise they'll eventually end up being an indie streaming service, which has been a nice stop-gap before they set themselves up with more content like this.&&It's ok. They still have about 600 Indian movies on Netflix US.&&The problem is that no one will sell them the rights anymore. 

Everyone else wants to get the rights to their properties back so they can open competing streaming services.

Early on most companies licensed their shit to Netflix for nothing or next to nothing. Many of those agreements are up or are coming up and Netflix knows they won't be able to get other content again. So, they gotta make it.&&Netflix used to buy the streaming rights to great movies and shows for dirt cheap because all the established players were so entrenched in old methods of media distribution that nobody gave a damn about streaming *except* Netflix.

Then, once Netflix started to kick everybody else in the pants, the IP owners started charging more for streaming rights and/or starting their own services. So Netflix now has to produce its own content to stay competitive.&&The thing about buying rites to movies and shows is... Once everybody else saw netflix was printing cash by doing it, they decided to withhold their own catalogs to start their own streaming services.&&It's because they're forced to. In the past they could get a lot of content relatively cheap, nowadays they're paying the maximum price. They also want to become more independent instead of having to rely on having to purchase shows and movies.&&>i guess they've chosen this route over buying the rights to movies like in the past

You've got that backwards. By the early 2010s the studios and networks had wised up on streaming and were starting to squeeze Netflix on licensing, or even outright refusing them in hopes of starting their own streaming service. This forced Netflix to pursue their own content.&&Competition for movie rights is a lot higher than it used to be, plus a ton of companies are launching their own platforms.  I think it makes a lot of sense&&> They should stick to TV series because honestly their original movies have been like 80% crap, 10% okay and 10% good.

They are not necessarily worrying about critical acclaim, just views. They have advanced tracking for viewership so I'm sure they know better than we do what is profitable and what isn't.&&>  Game Over, Man

It definitely wasn't that good but did you honestly expect it to be? I wasn't disappointed with it . It was exactly what I expected . Had a few laugh out loud moments and thats all  i really wanted to get out of it. I dont even pay for Netflix so its not like I went to the movies and spent a bunch of money to watch it .&&> 80% crap, 10% okay and 10% good.

I feel like that's just a pretty standard distribution for all films in general.&&This is a very good point and one that I'm only just now starting to see be made more frequently. There is a shit-ton of content out there and more and more streaming services by the day. There is no way we're going to watch it all. 

I like the points you made on the VHS heydays and how no one is likely going to feel nostalgic for Netflix's newer content. Their only option is a constant influx of new stuff. &&At this point, I think Netflix is largely motivated by quantity.  They know a lot of companies are going to continue pulling content in the near future, and they don't want their catalog to shrink to the point where people start cancelling because they feel they've watched everything.  Netflix isn't depending on nostalgia so much as they are the people who aren't sure what they want to watch and will browse until something piques their interest.

Though, I do wonder how that will work out for them in the long-term.  I've already felt they've started watering down the Netflix brand on the television side by labeling any foreign show they get streaming rights to as ""Netflix Originals"", but I've never even seen the Netflix logo on a movie as a mark of quality.  Like others have said, I can probably count on one hand the number of Netflix movies I've watched and consider to be good.  Unless they start to improve on that side, I can very easily see where I'll just avoid any movie listed as Netflix's.&&/r/hedidthemath&&~~Someone else posted a link saying their revenue last quarter was $11 billion, which puts their revenue at a bit over $120 million a day.

I'm old enough to have been aware of myself and the concept of music, when this song became a hit in my country. You'd hear it everywhere and all the time. At first I liked it, then I got annoyed and forgot about it eventually, together with the public.  
If you'd ask me, I couldn't even tell you the name or interpret.  
Fast forward a few years, I remember this song and an idea about how it sounds or what was sung, but for my life I couldn't find it - mind you these were the 2000s and just looking anything up in an instant wasn't quite a thing yet. So I forget about it again.  
   
Fast forward some more to last year, when I had quite a weird rollercoaster of a relationship with a woman from Italy. Since we had a taste in music incommon, we'd share each other songs we'd like or currently hear and most of the time she loved what I sent and vice versa.

Frankly, considering the calibre of the three leads and that they're recreating 1970s New York on a big scale, it's not the most outlandish budget in the world.&&Luckily Netflix cares less about box office returns and more about having cachet movies like this. Since they're paying to own the rights they can keep it available forever, and having big-name movies like this adds subscribers and keeps subscribers around.

Also, keep in mind that Netflix has like 120,000,000 subscribers, so they've got hundreds of millions of dollars in of revenue coming in every month.&&That's a lot of italians for a movie called ""The Irishman""&&Straight to Netflix kind of **is** straight to DVD IMO. &&I liked it for what it was.

But yeah they're probably intentionally pushing a lot of content out there. Even if the Ryan Reynolds movie doesn't yield _any_ benefit to them they'd barely notice though. It's more about all the projects they're doing altogether.&&> Many major entertainment companies want their own flavor of Netflix instead.

Then it just remains to be seen what market saturation will be of streaming services. How many services will people realistically buy into? One? Seven?

An entire season of an already bona-fide hit for 83MM is not the same at all as 150MM for a single unproven movie.



>  Fox can threaten to pull all of Die Hard if Netflix doesn't hit the price point they want but if Netflix has a bunch of other content they can depend on being there that's a lot less scary for them.

This is a much better point, and makes me start to see why they are doing this. The movie itself may not be worth the investment, but the bargaining position sure is. &&Like their Adam Sandler deal. It's seems nobody actually likes his movies, but they get a ton of views - so it's a good buy for Netflix.&&True, but I don't really watch Netflix originals *because* most of the ones I had watched were crap, and after watching some more recently I only re-confirmed that.

They must have enough people watching to make it worth it, but I dunno. They are not a driving factor for me at all. Their TV shows are a different story, there are a lot of shitty ones but enough good ones to keep my interest - but the MOVIES? Their movies are almost all crap.

But I guess they're cheaper to produce than a season of TV with high production values a lot of the time and people are more willing to just sit and watch a crappy movie than get invested in a TV show. 

They definitely seem to run everything by the numbers. I liked The Get Down, and it seemed to get some mixed reviews at first but turned more positive, and it seemed like people were watching it, but the show got cancelled simply because it was so expensive to make, not because it couldn't draw an audience.&&>  There is no way we're going to watch it all. 

that isn't even a thing of the future. according to the New York Post, 487 (!) original scripted programs aired in 2017. not only did no one watch all of these, most people likely watched a tiny percentage.

I mean, just relatively few years ago it was just a few handful of tv shows that would commonly get praised. nowadays there are *lots* of them - so many that hardly anyone could even watch all those that mostly got a good reception.

I'm sure it would still be pricey without the CG just because of the talent involved, I'm just saying I don't blame Paramount for dumping the movie when they realized it was going to be bleed money.

They may even continue their 'Disney Vault' tradition for their own stuff, to keep things fresh and not lose on big release sales.

Imagine somewhere you could exclusively stream *all* Star Wars films, Marvel films, a bunch of huge classic franchises, Fox cartoons (Simpsons/Family Guy etc./King of the Hill), all FX shows (like Archer), a huge amount of other Fox shows and *all* Disney & Pixar films.

I can't see that failing by any means.

Just a (really likely) hunch, hugely bolstered if that acquisition goes through.&&And that is the reason Netflix is spending so much money.  They have established themselves as a place where about once a month they seem to have a hit, and usually every week or two something new will come out that will appeal to most people.

If they get stagnant, people will jump to another service. &&Not everything Marvel and Star Warsl.

From the article:
> Here’s how it will work. The OTT platform, whose price point wasn’t mentioned, will start with a domestic service only, and then expand overseas. There will be no R-rated films, and the programming will be consistent with the Disney brand. The R-rated stuff will go on Hulu. The plan now is to leave the various Marvel series where they are, which means Netflix will hang onto its superhero inventory.&&> An entire season of an already bona-fide hit for 83MM is not the same at all as 150MM for a single unproven movie.

I didn't say it was the same. The risk part is obvious and I was saying that it's in the same ballpark budget-wise. The original point was that they were surprised a $10/month service could afford $150 million for a movie. I was just saying there have been other shows in that same vein and it's been sustainable enough for HBO to have gotten away with it for decades.

> The movie itself may not be worth the investment, but the bargaining position sure is.

Netflix still wants the movies to be successful. They could have a million movies nobody wants to see and will have a retention factor of zero. So subscription services have different criteria for success than traditional broadcast or theatrical releases but they definitely still want it to be worth the investment. They're just looking at a different set of numbers is all.&&Tons of people like his movies. He gets crap on reddit constantly but it's pretty clear anywhere outside here that he has a pretty big fan base still&&Netflix isn't counting on people watching *everything* though.  They've had a very scattershot approach from early on where they try to have as much content to appeal to as many different people as possible.  They aren't catering to any particular audience since they want to keep as large and varied of a subscriber base as possible.  And even if they aren't appealing to you specifically, another part of their model is appearing to have a large selection with frequent new releases so you feel like you're getting your money's worth even if you are just going to watch a tiny percentage of them.&&Fun Fact: The sample is from De La Soul's Breakadawn, a great mellow track on their 3rd album.

I think that's why.&&Anthony Hopkins in the first season of West World was really good too.&&Tbf his was only a projection in universe so it didn’t need to be too good. &&Did the people you talk to know Peter Cushing had passed away? This is totally anecdotal but I noticed that after I watched Rogue One with people who did not know who Peter Cushing was/that he passed away awhile ago didn't notice he was cgi. 

Just thought I would toss in my two cents to maybe explain why it stood out to some people vs. others not noticing it. &&Because they didnt take the patience marvel did. They tried to rush it. Didnt learn from mistakes and generally had a bad person running organization of the universe.

In the movie Grudge Match they deage Sylvester Stallone and De Niro with these creepy uncanny valley cgi models. Look it up on YouTube, you won’t be disappointed &&Age-up makeup is always really difficult, because you're *adding* to the face, whereas when you age, you usually *lose* from the face and your skin becomes more elastic. It's actually really easy to do elderly CGI makeup (like in The Winter Soldier for Peggy) but much more difficult to make someone look younger. We're getting there though, and considering there's a wealth of material from when the three main actors were younger (and in high quality) it should be much easier to create a de-aged version.&&I don’t remember any bad makeup in that movie, but it’s been a while. 

Screenshot?&&I don't recall Raging Bull being bad at all. Some makeup sure, but most of that was weight DeNiro put on for that part of the role.

It holds up.&&His best cgi face was as the vanisher.&&In my experience they don't know the DCAU exists at all since most people are focused on live action.

I guess my question was a bit rhetorical. I know why they are not successful, but it just seems weird that they don't put people in charge that would actually make it successful.

I'm sure it's a bunch of postering, finger pointing, and passing the buck as to why ""X movie didn't do well at the box office"". 

Here's a start, the stories are shit, the casting is mostly shit, and (as you said) you haven't taken the time to create a world, and FFS it doesn't have to be so damned gritty!

They try to duplicate this in their other franchises but seem to lack the quality team Nolan had. Marvel is light-hearted, comedic action. It's much easier to do&&It's not known exactly why Mars passed, but we do know that Hershey's didn't pay directly to be in the movie:

> Hershey did not pay to have Reese’s Pieces used in E.T., but it did agree to do a tie-in between the movie and the candy after the film was released. A deal was inked wherein Hershey Foods agreed to promote E.T. with $1 million of advertising; in return, Hershey could use E.T. in its own ads.

My posting of it \(on my FB page\) has this additional comment:

'After 35 years, they finally allowed me to make the score public. This score was actually written after the fact. At the time, when Lucasfilm wanted to apply for a copyright, we had to have a written score. They didn't want either a computer program \(the true score\) or a recording. So I got out my rapidographs and French curves and drafted this. Last week, I pulled the original out of my file cabinet \- it had a few mildew spots, but was otherwise in pretty good shape. Hmm. I don't think I have a single piece of intact digital medium from then. I notice now that there are some errors in the score. For instance, it isn't really in D\-major \- it was based on a 150 Hz tone, which is some cents sharp of a D \(146.83 Hz\). Plus, the range of the wandering tones at the beginning is a bit hard to calculate \- I put some bounds on them, but with the randomness, I don't know offhand exactly how high or how low they got. Next, the final chord is shown on a staff which is normally used for equal\-tempered scales. This chord actually is built on just intonation. Fifths are exactly 3/2 times the frequency of the tonic, and so on. Yes, there is a major\-third at the top, at exactly 5/4 ratio. Enjoy!?'""

From abbreviations.com:

THX is a high\-fidelity audio/visual reproduction  standard for movie theaters, screening rooms, home theaters, computer  speakers, gaming consoles, and car audio systems. The current THX was  created in 2002 when it spun off from Lucasfilm Ltd. THX was developed  by Tomlinson Holman at George Lucas's company, Lucasfilm, in 1983 to  ensure that the soundtrack for the third Star Wars film, Return of the  Jedi, would be accurately reproduced in the best venues. THX was named  after Holman, with the ""X"" standing for ""crossover"" as well as an homage  to Lucas's first film, THX 1138. The distinctive crescendo used in the  THX trailers, created by Holman's coworker James A. Moorer, is known as  the ""Deep Note"". The THX system is not a recording technology, and it does not specify a  sound recording format: all sound formats, whether digital or analog,  can be ""shown in THX."" THX is mainly a quality assurance system.  THX\-certified theaters provide a high\-quality, predictable playback  environment to ensure that any film soundtrack mixed in THX will sound  as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also  provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use  is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific  acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements  include a floating floor, baffled and acoustically treated walls, no  parallel walls, a perforated screen, and NC30 rating for background  noise.&&I still get goose bumps.

So like a trombone?&&Long: spanning a large interval of space or time&&even clumsier!&&True random number generation is a strange concept (which is to say it's mostly just a thing we made up to describe a phenomenon, and suffers from the  'just a word' problem.) But as defined by statisticians, it requires two things: that any value is as likely to appear at any time as any other, and that no pattern can be discerned with the information available, which means it is context dependent.

Atmospheric noise (and other natural randomizations, such as lava random) are very close to truly random, but fall short on the basis that there is a limit to the number of times a value can appear consecutively, however the limit is flexible, based on the resolutions, and we can zoom out far enough that the limit becomes large enough to suit whatever purpose we can contrive, so it is close enough for any finite set of random numbers.

Radioactive decay (and other varieties of quantum randomness) don't have this limit, and so are for all purposes, truly random. If in the future, a method is discovered to foretell the pattern of decay, it will stop being random, but only in  such situations where we have those tools available.

His 'philanthropy' and struggle with murdering his traitor brother was interesting. The film was not nearly as bad as I expected. People always poke fun at godfather part 3 and I went in with ultra low expectations, but I enjoyed it. It was better than 90% of the stuff coming out within the past year.  As a standalone it was fine, the others are classics but are also 15 years older. The magic was unfortunately gone. It's like the revival of arrested development. It's still good, but not the same (granted I hated new arrested development, go each their own). One and two both had multiple scenes that will stick with me the rest of my life. 3 was too predictable and cliche even with the weird ass cousin fucking.

This is technically written as a glissando, but traditionally clarinetists ""smear"" it into a portamento.

In regular stereo it just sounds like stereo, but with the right decoder you can separate the signals back out to their intended locations. This is how 35mm analog surround was done from the release of the original Star Wars to the advent of digital surround in the early 90's.

I think it’s generally thought of strictly on a pitch continuum, which is hitting every pitch - not just the half steps piano is limited to. So maybe think fretless strings, timpani, voice, certain wind instruments (i.e. clarinet, sax, slide trombone), steel lap guitars and slide guitar (Derek Trucks), and synthesizer with that little flipper in your left hand.

Very common technique in jazz and blues. 

Edit: word&&When there are discrete pitches (piano, guitar, harp) it's a glissando. When it's ""analog"", so it goes smoothly from one tone to another, it's a portamento (trombone, violin).&&Yeah, a piano's notes all play a certain frequency each, and each note jumps a specific number of frequencies while portmento is more of a slide. I'd describe it as the difference of black to white and a grayscale gradient, they both start and end at the same color but the transition is smoother. &&Yes? Electron shot noise is when your current is measured well enough that it is sensitive to the fact that it is really individual electrons passing through.

Also I'm not sure where all this gold came from but thanks.&&Oceans seems modular enough that swapping out the cast is easy enough, it's a name people like but don't love so you've got brand recognition but no one's standards are especially high. It's a logical move.&&It's not even a remake. It's a sequel/spin-off to the Clooney/Pitt/Damon trilogy.  Damon and Reiner's characters both cameo in the movie.&&Because movies like Annihilation, Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow, and Haywire fail to capture an audience.

Edit: I'd like to add that I personally didn't like Haywire.  Annihilation and Atomic Blonde are pretty great, though.

Also, Salt still hasn't gotten a sequel either.&&It feels like a bit of a false premise to me to be honest. Apart from the two you mentioned I can't think of any other remakes that fit the description, whereas there are some new films starting to come through with strong female leads \(in the mainstream we have things like Captain Marvel, Annihilation etc.\), not loads sure, but more than there are remakes I think?&&They do both. There's lots of movies.&&They're not choosing to do it ""rather"" than make movies with strong women, they're doing both. Later this year we've got Widows, Mary Queen of Scots, On the Basis of Sex, The Favourite, Suspiria and Alita Battle Angel. But reboots are the name of the game right now in Hollywood, and basically every film famous enough to be rebooted has a largely male cast. Doing this makes it so that you can still crib off well-known names without having a cast that's entirely male. Gender flipping is partially a marketing tactic, yes, but so is something like putting Tony Stark in a Spider-Man movie. Movies are very corporate now. This is a big issue, but gender-flipping is hardly the biggest part of it.

And how many gender-flipped reboots have there been again? Two. That's right: TWO. There have been more movies featuring Paul Bettany as The Vision than there have been movies with a gender-swapped cast. It's hardly an issue. &&>Is anyone excited for this?

Yup. I like heist films, and I like Gary Ross, and I like everyone featured. 

It's not like Ocean's 11 was stunningly, perfectly, totally original back in 2001, besides.&&Ocean's 8 is not a remake.  They view this franchise as  brand and if people liked the first three movies they might like this one. She's Ocean's sister. 

Also this is associated with a re-make, which was much better than the original. &&The problem isn't remakes with all-female casts. The problem is _remakes_. What does it matter what gender the cast is?

Ghostbusters wasn't bad because it was all-women, it was bad because it had poor writing, poor directing and was just in general a bad idea for a remake. The all-female cast was the _least_ of its problems.&&Steven Soderbergh is doing it and the leads are Academy Award winning actresses. Why anyone would complain about a movie like that being 95% female is beyond me.&&Annihilation was an almost all female cast and it's absolutely amazing. Sadly, its wasn't really talked about and GA didn't even see it or care.. &&I think Oceans 8 looks pretty good. They have a solid cast and the trailer looked interesting enough for me to see it&&Dude, it's just name recognition. People go for remakes in general, they buy brands in general. So it's just a corporate way of increasing the odds of making their money back. It's really simple.&&because the most reliably marketable thing about any movie is the name.&&Oceans 8 isn't a remake.&&I'm so pumped for a big heist movie I don't get why are like ""oh no it's all women."" I don't think anyone said ""oh no it's all men"" when Oceans 11 came out &&But Oceans 8 isn't a remake; Sandra Bullock is Danny Ocean's sister. It's a female led entry into the franchise rather than a remake, and I'm all for that.&&1 released movie is not exactly a trend &&Because people flock to the familiar. It's the same reason we see so many remakes that don't have an all female cast. It's just that the ones with an all female cast are getting attention.

Like any remake, it can go either way. I didn't hate Ghostbusters, but I didn't love it. It was ""very okay"" to me (granted I'm also a little too young to have any strong feelings about the original Ghostbusters), but the Oceans 8 trailer actually looks good, to me. I'm kind of looking forward to it.&&You can literally ask this question with male leads as well. We live in the age of the reboot.&&Why do they remake anything? Why is it all the all-women casts that get the brunt of the criticism?&&It seems to be a combination of cost considerations (existing IP is easier to work with, just gender-bend and modify a little bit) and the flawed way that writers approach female characters.

Elaborating more on the second point, note that female empowerment is often portrayed through misandry or explicitly stating ""I can do it myself"", their independence is often trivialized with statements like ""oh, my brother/dad/other male relative taught me how to do this"" rather than allowing accomplishments to be their own, and that they're often the objects of sexual assault or romantic conflict. They're only victims because of their bodies, they absolutely have to express their independence through exposition rather than allowing it to be implied through action, and nothing they do comes from their own motives or free will. Of course, that's just one extreme. The other extreme isn't as common, but is typically portrayed through female characters that have no flaws whatsoever and make for a bland, boring, two-dimensional representation.

A good rule of thumb: write the character as a female character, then swap out as a male. If the character still makes sense, doesn't seem like a weird caricature, and doesn't feel completely bland, then you probably did a decent job, at least as far as avoiding the more terrible cliches. Alternatively, write the character as a male and then swap out as a female--the effect should be roughly the same.

**tl;dr** - Lazy writing is cheap. Good writing costs a bit more, both in money and in the effort in breaking away from gender stereotypes.&&It's not a remake. It's a continuation of the series with different actors who just happen to be female. Why did we need to remake it at all with Clooney and Pitt? You do realize that it was originally a movie in the 60s with Sinatra and the Rat Pack, right? So your gripe about changing to female actors comes across as sexist when the one you're referencing is a remake itself. 

I am looking quite forward to seeing a fresh take on this series. I thought the modern Oceans 11 was fun and really well done. But 12 and 13 were less original and less interesting. Since this one has a different cast of actors who I happen to like and a fresh setting (not gambling based), I'm going to give it a fair shot.&&How could you fail to mention the 1992 Penny Marshall *classic* ""A League of Their Own?""&&Because new IPs don't sell well, lead female or otherwise. Annihilation literally fits the bill of what you're describing and nobody went to see it. Sequels and reboots are seen as safe by the studio.&&People will watch GOOD movies regardless of the gender of the lead.  The Alien and Hunger Games franchises prove it.  
Don't blame the public if the movie and/or marketing sucks. &&Ocean’s Eight is not a remake. It is part of the Ocean’s franchise. The story evolves around George Clooney’s character’s sister, played by Sandra Bullock. &&[deleted]&&The recent installment of Ghostbusters wasn't bad because of the women, it was bad because the characters weren't a team.

In the original, Venkman was the funny guy, Egon (whatever, I'm not looking it up) was the straight man, Ray was the weird one and Winston was the 'man on the street'. It worked because they all had a role and filled it with 'chemistry'.

The new one didn't work because they were all the funny guy and each one was just marking time until it was their turn to be funny. Which is pretty lame.

None of this has anything to do with genitalia.&&It really doesn't help being compared to good films where there was an all male cast either. It just gives sexist people a giant target to take aim at. &&Ocean's 8 is a sequel/spinoff, not a remake.&&Not just perceived but actual demonstrable easier sells.&&Yeah I mean this is exactly why the Clooney OCEANS 11 exists. It took a 'cool' property (Whose reputation is much better than the movie actually deserves) and filled it with a modern-day equivalent of the Rat Pack. It's a great movie anyway, but it was also marketed to very much capitalise on the 'coolness' factor.&&And an all female movie is already a risk. So movies taking extra risks on top of an all female cast are either not going to get made, are going to get made with tiny budgets(there are plenty of female movies you've never heard of). If you want to do an all-female ghostbusters maybe you get funding. If you want an all female middle eastern sci-fi art house allegorical homage to early transcendentalism and the work of Robert Hass then I hope you enjoy eating ramen and have friends who work for free.&&See the story of Deadpool. They had to fight for years for it because it was ""risky"".&&I'm still waiting for Titanic 2.&&This is the answer.

They were going to make an all-female heist movie anyways. They were going to make an all-female science fiction comedy anyways.

But tacking on Ghostbusters or Ocean's on the title solidifies the film as a blockbuster with major appeal.&&That and when given a choice between something they've never heard of and something they have, the overwhelming majority of people will choose the one they've heard of almost all of the time. Even if the one they've heard of isn't that good.

For something original to really take hold, it pretty much has to fill a niche that is underserved, whether it's because there aren't any real options or because what exists is so bad that people will risk the unknown.&&Also for pre-existing IP's the people making the movie probably have all the rights sorted out.  It's also why they make movies out of board games and amusement park rides.  They can pay writers to make the scripts but they hold the rights to the IP.  &&The biggest problem isn’t the remake part, it’s the strong women part. Movies work because the protagonist(s) start the movie with a flaw, a weakness that the trials the movie puts them through will help them overcome, but because Hollywood is afraid of alienating women by making a flawed female character, they start out as perfect and have nowhere to go. This means there’s nothing for the audience to invest in.

Take a look at The Force Awakens vs A New Hope, for example. Luke’s a brat who thinks in his young mind that he knows everything, and then he’s thrown into a situation where he’s forced to grow up, and he’s not ready for it. In The Force Awakens, Rey, a strong female, has no personal imperfections and therefore nowhere to go.

Same with Ghostbusters. You’ve got a bunch of guys who are starting this business for their own selfish reasons, and through the course of the film they each have to overcome their personal flaws and put their selfishness aside to bring about a positive outcome. In the remake, the characters have no flaws, no weaknesses, so the wisecracking simply comes across as obtuse.

The point is that films need a character with an arc, to have room to grow, lessons to learn. As Emilia Clarke alluded the other day, the strong woman trope (even though it has come about through female group pressure) doesn’t marry with the narrative string we’re all used to. Sure, a female protagonist can be strong, but not in every single way. 

Edit: If you’re interested in learning more about how screenplays are written, check out Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, it’s very good.&&I'm still waiting for the 12 Angry Women movie.

Do they have to do the male sequel first before the one with the women ?&&Call me when we get an all female cast of **Brokeback Mountain**&&Annihilation was kinda sorta like that.&&Pretty much The Descent.&&Call me when we get an all female cast of **12 Angry Men**

Don't call me for the sequel, the prequel or the 7 post credit scenes&&I legitimately want to know what people's idea of female Kurt Russell or Keith David is...&&Now this I could get behind!

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0905372/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_29&&I mean, MEW as lead actress and a strong supporting cast for her journey earned that movie nothing but derision... 

So they can't get much worse reviews than that, eh?&&This is the correct answer. We as a society want to believe we'd go see a female driven movie because what's the big deal right? But the truth is the general public needs a reason to go see a movie and that isn't enough of a reason. So group of women plan a heist isn't a movie that's going to get as many people in the theaters as Oceans 8 because the Oceans franchise is a familiar one. 

But while we're on the subject, this isn't specific to female led films. Even the Clooney Oceans 11 was technically a remake. Not because they felt like the original needed to be remade, but because if you're gonna get Clooney and Damon and nine other know actors in one movie you need to be able to convince the check writers that people will go see it. &&This is true for sequels to ongoing, established franchises, but a lot of remakes flop and lose money. Robocop, Ben Hur, Total Recall, Ghostbusters and many more were big\-budget flops. For every reboot that succeeds, there seems to be 2 or 3 that fail.

I honestly feel that we see so many reboots because there's less accountability for executives that way. If you try a new IP and it flops, then you're the idiot who splunked $150m \(\+marketing\) thinking that people would want to see a sci\-fi comedy about the Founding Fathers time\-travelling, or whatever the grand new idea was.  But if it's an existing IP being rebooted, then you can already 'prove' that people like the idea: it's just the directors or marketers or actors fault that the audience didn't go for this particular **interpretation** of the idea.

I really believe that execs don't necessarily think reboots are more likely to make money, they're just easier to greenlight because you're not putting yourself out there with some risky new idea \(and in Hollywood, 'risky' and 'new' are basically synonyms\) and it's much easier to transfer accountability to somebody else if things go wrong.&&Yep. The ghostbusters remake still made way more than Annihilation. Obviously they’re 2 completely different movies/audiences but the point still stands&&People fear the unknown. (hi l am Lexa, don't fear me)&&I fucking loved Annihilation. Honestly that scene in the house is one of the most horrifying things I've seen in a movie, it was amazing. &&Movie barely came off as an all-female cast to me, and I wasn't really paying attention to the marketing, but was it marketed like that as well?

It was definitely a mostly female cast done very well.

Edit: wow that blew up a bit. And dang, that gold literally came out of nowhere. Thanks!
&&I never even knew about that movie until it was out of theaters.&&It will pick up steam over the coming years... I bet. People just need to digest a movie like that...

Imo it was an excellent movie and a great all female cast. They were grounded in a great premise, script and theme with the all female cast being secondary and the movie was better for it. Focusing on it being an all female
Cast movie first would have made the rest of the movie suffer like Ghostbusters which was a bad movie.&&That's how you make a movie with an all female cast that's not about an all female cast.&&Huh, now that you mention it, it did have an all female cast.. Didnt register with me. &&How did it fail if it was not released in theaters? You don't buy tickets when you watch movies on Netflix.&&From what I can tell it's not even a remake, Sandra Bullock's character is supposed to be George Cooney's character's sister. All the Ocean movies are heist movies. This is following the formula but it's still an original movie.&&I agree. The George Clooney movie was already a remake and it did well. They kinda messed up with the third one of his and now they're trying the female version. Why not, it'll be fun.&&So it's a spin off to a trilogy thats a remake of a single movie.&&Plus, Sandra Bullocks character is Danielle Ocean, Danny Oceans sister.&&Annihilation had not great marketing, the studio had absolutely no faith in the film (part of the reason why Netflix released it worldwide outside of the US). It's also kind of a niche movie, so it would never have been a big blockbuster even if it had a big male lead.&&I’m going to say annihilation got no marketing.

&&>And how many gender-flipped reboots have there been again? Two.

One, actually. Ocean's 8 isn't even a reboot. It's a spin-off with Clooney's character's sister as the main character. It's literally just another film in the series, following up on an established plot point.&&This is the ""a room can be 20% women and people will say it was 50% women"" dynamic. People are so used to exclusion, any inclusion stands out and people mistake that for parity.&&This is absolutely right. We are seeing a ton of fantastic films with rich and deep feminine perspectives coming out. There are serious dramas like Room, Wild and Ladybird just to name a few off the top of my head. And even genre films like The Shallows or 10 Cloverfield Lane feature smart, clever women who outsmart bad guys and monsters with their wits and determination rather than being a screaming damsel in distress, and they are better for it. It’s just a general trend that women are being represented more, and better.&&favorite comment in the thread and the one i think puts it best/brings a different perspective&&> Ocean's 11 was stunningly, perfectly, totally original back in 2001

It was itself a remake lol.&&Indeed. If this movie would have had an all\-male cast and the same script it would have still been a really bad movie.&& I think Ghostbusters has a lot of potential as a remake. But Feige is terrible for it. He didn't understand, nor care about the source material. And the guy's a hack who's humor always goes for the low hanging fruit and who can barely compose a decent narrative.

The EPA was villified in the original but nowadays, the environment is a huge concern. Hell, maybe the ghosts aren't arising cause of some Sumerian prophecy but due to some unforeseeable meltdown. Meanwhile the attitudes towards entrepeneurs has evolved quite a bit as well. Hell, gender bending could be really interesting in that light. What is it like for a couple of women to deal with not just starting a business but effectively creating an industry many would assume is a scam? That raises some interesting questiosn.&&But Ocean's 11 is a remake. &&If it delivers a fun heist movie where I don't immediately call out how they'll pull off the job but I can look back and see some of the foreshadowing, I'll be happy. If there are a few memorable one-liners or jokes that I can repeat until they get really old, even better.&&I mean, part of me does want to see it just because it is an all female heist movie and that's going to be really fun and, as a woman, it's going to just be nice to see other women doing cool things&&Unlike Ocean's 11.&&Like the American Pie films

&&It was bad for so many distinct, separate reasons. Yours being one of them. The original GB was a clever premise, tense, fun, well-paced, witty, well-acted, and somehow existed in a world that was equal parts horror, sci fi, and comedy. There's a reason it was so successful and is beloved to this day. 

Really quite astounding how awful the remake turned out to be. It contained virtually none of the  things that made the original so special. &&> The new one didn't work because they were all the funny guy and each one was just marking time until it was their turn to be funny. Which is pretty lame.

Man, that's a really good point. I've seen a lot of stupid criticism of TFA, and I think this might be the first fair thing I've heard. I liked it, and I like Rey fine, but she's not a character who specifically sticks out in my head, and this is probably why. Remarkable because the story demands it, not because she's a particularly well written character.


> Hollywood is afraid of alienating women by making a flawed female character

It seems like a bigger insult to women to not even bother trying to write them as real people. Does anyone *actually* like female characters with no imperfections?&&> The Force Awakens vs A New Hope,

But by the end, she had grown as a person.  And her flaws had receded.  I know I probably should not use an animated movie, but that is an example of growth for a female lead.

&&That is why I hate Rey. Her main struggle is not to grow as a character, but to receive approval/validation of how she is amazing from other characters. Basically, all her scenes with Luke is not to improve her character, but to receive validation of her awesomeness from him. &&It's why Ripley in Alien and Aliens works so well. Because she starts off weak and gains strength. In the first film, she's by the book and timid, slowly coming into her own as things fall apart. 

In Aliens a similar thing happens again. Why does Ripley end up being a double gun tooting woman death machine? Because of her daughter. She lost her daughter and so latches onto Newt, who would have been roughly the same age as her daughter would have been. 

She lost her daughter once due to the aliens, she wouldn't be losing another. &&Sicario did this really well.

*this* is what gets gilded? Thanks, but really?&&Never trust reviews normally but stayed away from it. Watched it sunday night and i was fucking superb.

Edit: thanks for the gold friend!&&Ohh yeah, at this point I worked out not the best movie to watch while my 4yo was awake. 

&&That's the point, it wasn't marketed as OMG WOMZ, and it didn't get any of that gimmick dollar.

If enough people say the same, the you have consensus.&&I thought the 3rd one was better than the 2nd one. The 2nd one was a bit too meta and didn't really have a heist (well it did, but we didn't know about it until the end and it kind of left us wondering)&&I also like the idea that is set in the *Oceans* universe.

There's a lot of unspoken depth to those movies. It's never explained how any of the characters know each other, they just do. It's the world they live in. Danny Ocean gets out of jail and within 24 hours he starts throwing together a plan to steal 150 million dollars from a casino three(?) weeks from that day. In that time, he builds his team, none of which need to be trained because they're all specialists in their own fields and neatly fill their role in the plan. And more than that, you get the feeling that this is just every day for them. As common as a freelancer going from place to place. Not to mention Matt Damon's character who is the son of two professional criminals that you learn practically nothing else about because in that world, they don't need to be explained who they are. It's like if you told someone you were Trump's son. Nobody in the western world needs an explanation for who Donald Trump is.

So from my point of view ~~the Jedi are evil~~ if Danny Ocean can put together a team of ten men to stage a heist, why can't 8 women do the same thing? In this world, it's not a gimmick. It's just another day in a world of criminals.

You can complain about marketing strategies and movie gimmicks usually, but when there's good lore of an already established setting then it's not a gimmick, it's just exploring more of this place.&&The original is not good. The remake expands on the original idea and is so much better.&&Yeah, it falls somewhere along those lines. I think?&&Can't believe they sent a brother and sister into space together.&&what were there parents on to name their kids daniel and danielle&&That's... fucked up. Danny Ocean finds an SO who looks exactly like his own sister.

Edit: I am an idiot. It was Julia Roberts not Sandra Bullock.&&I literally hadn't even heard of the movie until well over a month after it was released, and that genre was right up my alley. Most people I've talked to about it now have still never heard of it. 

I don't know who was responsible for the marketing but damn did they fail.&&Really unfortunate because it's a very good movie.

&&I didn't hear about it until this thread so you got me beat.&&I thought I had heard that Atomic Blonde had already gotten a sequel greenlit?&&Atomic Blonde kicked ass, that soundtrack was great and the fight scenes pumped me up. I was so hyped after watching it!&&Atomic Blonde was so fucking badass &&Atomic Blonde made way more than the first John Wick movie and over three times its budget coming up on 100 million. It's actually insane that I hear people trying to push the idea that it didn't do well!

An R rated indie movie with zero brand recognition that had marketing mostly focused on comic cons and social media made almost 100 million. And without being screened in China. That is a fucking success! &&Atomic Blonde made $95 million worldwide and is getting a sequel. 

Of course, Ghostbusters made $230 million worldwide, and that's why they do remakes.&&>Annihilation was way too hard sci-fi for casual viewers, I don't think the female actors were what people struggled with.

Agreed. I really enjoyed the movie, but I'm someone that loves SCI FI anyway. That's the thing though, if its a good movie, I don't even really pay attention to the sex of the protagonist. People make such a huge deal out of it and that really annoys me. A good movie is a good movie, regardless of genders. &&I don’t get why you’re getting downvotes. Atomic blonde made 100myn on a 30myn budget. And annihilation is way to sci fi for a mainstream audience. Reading the book could tell you all you need to know about that 

For ref, he was at -3 when I replied &&I'm not trying to argue, just wondering what makes annihilation too hard of a sci-fi for casual audience? Is it the slow pacing?&&[deleted]&&Ah, it is. Well that's one that had an all female cast before so I guess it still counts!&&This is the most important point, I think. The movie hasn't even come out and people have already dismissed it, despite the fact that it's not even a reboot??&&It is a reboot, but it’s not a remake. &&The Bechdel Test isn't the end all be all of sexism in movies, and a lot of movies that fail it can be explained away on their own. But it's a little weird how few movies you can say ""yeah, two women with names talk to each other about something other than a man"".&&Yep. And while I don't think that disliking a female remake is sexist, I do think that pretending female remakes are some sort of outstanding problem that needs to be solved is. One of the most storied tactics of prejudice is making a small issue in a less privileged community look like a large issue so you can overcorrect. 

Also, to the people saying that pushing the all-female cast is an ""unfair"" marketing gimmick, c'mon. It's a totally fair marketing trend that's existed forever. People are allowed to push to specific demographics if they want, as long as they're not being exclusionary. &&Exactly. And I will say this in every comment I can: it is just as much a choice to keep a cast's demographics locked as it is to diversify them. People aren't forcing diversity, they are working against the forced *lack* of diversity. &&Really?&&Just imagine this script with the original cast as the original movie in the 80s... Nobody would talk about that franchise today, except in lists like ""worst movies Bill Murray was in"". &&Ghostbusters was not a really bad movie. There are tons of really bad movies out there, ghostbusters was not one of them. 

It wasn’t a good movie. Just not a really bad one. &&The 2001 movie is a remake of the 1960 movie, yes. So?

Ocean's 8 is _not_ actually a remake, as I understand it. It's just the next film in the current remake franchise, and _this_ film in the series happens to have an all-female main cast.&&So many people don't know this. It's also a remake where they added more minorities than the original cast had.&&You mean ignore the entire premade universe?&&1.6/10. Erm, I'll pass.&&Gotta love it when the top billed cast member on an IMDB doesn't have a photo.......&&I prefer the one with the rapping dog.&&I'm assuming the same for Jumanji. While it was a great movie on its own, it wasn't related to the original in any way. They just added a scene at the beginning in a desperate attempt to somehow connect it with the original.&&Yeah Die Hard with a Vengeance was originally a Lethal Weapon script but got made into Die Hard 3, which is actually probably my favorite of the franchise. I know the first is iconic, but the third had the added benefit of Samuel L. Jackson and Jeremy Irons.&&Wasn't Commando written as a Die Hard sequel or was it vice versa?  I'm too lazy to look into it&&>Like for example  a couple of the Die Hard sequels were not written as Die Hard movies. They were generic action movies, and they decided to use them for a Die Hard movie and changed a couple peoples names and a few lines of dialogue to reference older movies and called it a day.

Die Hard 2 was based on a novel that had nothing to do with Die Hard.

Die Hard 3 was originally  Lethal Weapon 4

Die Hard 4 was a reworked script called, and this is terrible, ""WW3.com""

Die Hard 5 is the only one that started as a Die Hard sequel.

If that's not weird enough the first Die Hard started as a sequel to a Sinatra movie, then was almost reworked into Commando 2 before becoming Die Hard. The whole franchise is a happy accident.
&&Die Hard 1 started as a Commando sequel for Arnie. Die Hard 3 was a Lethal Weapon script.&&Pretty much. Not being R-Rated was I think a main problem, because Feig excels in that kind of crass/gross-out humour. So, instead you end up with a Pg-13 movie that isn't crass enough to be really funny, whilst also being far too crass to suit the Ghostbusters brand (the original had more of a dry/sardonic humour). 

It was just a mismatch with the director, because Wiig/McCarthy are proven leads. I like McKinnon, but, she played the entire film like it was a two hour long SNL skit. Surprisingly, Leslie Jones, who I knew nothing about, was the one that actually managed to get a couple laughs out of me (and I think because her character is the one that most leans into Feigs' more loud/crass style). &&Well, considering many of the jokes were ""because we're women HAHA"" I would disagree with your premise.&&There was one thing I actually really liked about the Ghostbusters reboot. Y'know how in pretty much every movie male characters can often be realistically schlubby or unattractive but the female characters are always hot chicks? I liked how the Ghostbusters reboot had realistically schlubby unattractive women as the main leads instead of making them generically super hot like in every movie ever.&&Also Haunted Mansion, they wanted all the rides to be connected to films.&&I feel like a better phrase is ""complex female characters"". The biggest issue with female roles is they tend to be little more than an archetype (love interest, career woman, mother etc), which these kinds of remakes do absolutely nothing to fix (if anything they do the opposite).&&This seems to be an increasingly popular misconception, the strong female character's origin really has nothing to do with being well written. The trope came as a reaction to the damsel in distress. Instead of being a damsel, the female character was capable and strong, but the same problem still existed: they weren't fully fledged characters and exactly as one note as the damsel in distress.&&Something i feel studio ghibli gets right a lot. Their female characters always have something to offer that isn't just ""kick ass."" Whether its brains, bravery or compassion. But they are also flawed individuals who grow and learn&&Except the second any of those ""strong"" characters face any violence or adversity, or even show the slightest bit of vulnerability, the writers get blasted for ""abusing women"". Women aren't allowed to die, women aren't allowed to get maimed, women aren't allowed to be weak in films and that means that they will inevitably become mary sues. 

Look at how the Tomb raider origin story was handled, where Lara was not the complete badass because you know, teenager, and faced adversity, everything was suddenly ""violence against women"", by the same people who ask for ""strong female characters"". 

Shit, when Sansa got raped on Game of Thrones, the outrage was insane. Men get raped, murdered, tortured in horrible ways and it's fine, the main character for the first season gets his head chopped off, but one rape and suddenly everything is going too far. That's why it's hard for hollywood writers to write ""strong"" women, because adversity breeds believable strength and women in film are not allowed to face it. &&Godamn that was a good movie&&And Annihilation.&&I think that might be why the audience are conflicted in siding with Kylo instead (or, wishing he were the protagonist, or at least anti-hero), because he is so flawed. &&> Does anyone actually like female characters with no imperfections?

It's the cinematic equivalent of having candy for dinner. Works great when your development is equivalent to a 7 year old. &&TFA is just a rehash, but with a more boring main cast. That's my biggest problem with it. And the sequel doesn't rectify this. There's no real character growth, just overpowered bullshit. And then you have Kylo Ren...&&> Does anyone actually like female characters with no imperfections?

Of course they do. Same as they like male action heroes with no imperfections.

Part of the problem is we mostly seem to have these conversations about action blockbusters, which were an extremely shallow genre to begin with.&&Mary Sue characters are popular. Awful for stories  though.&&Rey: Goes in search of Jedi master in search of training. Verbally bitch slaps him out of his (deconstructed character rewritten after 30+ years of heroism to make her look good) funk, bests him in a duel, and even the ghost of his impossible-to-please master thinks she has surpassed him, and doesn't need any of that Zen shit he was so intent on.


Luke: Goes in search of Jedi master to begin training. Is constantly reminded that he must unlearn all that he has leaned. Fails tests over and over. Insists that he knows better than his teachers, and loses his hand for his hubris.&&To your second image, that's a classic ""fish out of water"" thing.  Protagonist is shown as incompetent/naive due to their innocence.  Over the course of the story, we watch them transform into a hero.  Rey seems to be done leveling up aready.&&God that annoyed me to no end. &&""Knows more about then Millunniom Falcon than Han does""&&Is that the movie where they eat a lot of spaghetti? &&* replies with any film with a lesbian sex scene *&&r/raisedbynarcissists &&https://i.imgur.com/9P3YmxU.jpg&&Gal Gadot&&I'm willing to take one for the team and dress in drag&&Scarlett Johansson?&&Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are average looking? where the fuck do you live?&&Wow, you just made the film sound interesting again and not just another Reddit masturbation joke.&&Jake and heath are average looking?&&Lol, since when has any of these money grab remakes ever respected the original material?  &&> average-looking 

*Pardon me?*&&That's because the Ghostbusters all female hype was drummed up and exploited from the studios before the movie was even in production. People were manipulated into thinking it was this important feminist thing and that idea spread around like wildfire.

Annihilation wasn't trying to use it's all female cast to manipulate audiences, it was just trying to be a good movie. It succeeded at that imo. Unfortunately studios gave up on it before it was marketed and put in theatres because Alex Garlands vision didn't mesh with the test audiences etc. &&Mostly female cast, featured for bulk of the film, some LGBT representation, not all Caucasian, no unnecessary sexualization... it was practically everything everyone demanded as far as Hollywood representation, just didn't appeal to a lot of people I guess.&&Which is weird and kind of sucks. I guess because it was so violent/gory, it's not a family friendly thing everyone can jump on board with. I thought it was decent, bonus points for being original. &&Oh come on, Annihilation and Ghostbusters were going after 2 completely different audiences. 

One was a blockbuster, one was a much more niche film. Let's get real.&&That's how it should be done. A strong female character should be a strong character without needing to constantly assert that she's a *woman* and look what *she* can do. Happens with poc characters too. If that becomes the norm, the issue largely dissipates.&&You most likely didn't realize it because it wasn't marketed as a movie you have to see or you hate women. It was marketed as a movie.&&One of my favourites too, I also found out that the US was shown an alternate ending which was aweful. The original ending is fantastic. And decent part 2 didn't happen... &&The descent is a phenomenal horror film. Claustrophobic as hell&&Kathy Bates &&Either character actor Margot Martindale or Aunt Lydia from the Handmaid's Tail would be my vote. &&As long as she come talk to me about diabetus diabetus&&Oh man, Sigourney Weaver too... But what about these days?&&But I liked the Jumanji movie and I thought it worked really well as an update. 

It made Jumanji more of a coming of age ""force"" in the universe that adapted. 

It was also interesting to see where Robin Williams went. Although that jungle was pretty awesome... anyway...&&Pretty much. Scripts get reworked all the time to fit a 'brand' because it's easier to sell a brand than it is something new. That doesn't speak to the quality of the movie itself (I think JUMANJI is a lot of fun) but that it's a short-hand to the audience. It gives some certainty to what they'll be seeing. &&The director, not the actor that's historically associated with heist and escape movies, before anyone asks. Because he's, you know, dead.&&That's also a remake. 
&&That scream has been in my head for weeks now. Haunting &&I fucking loved that scene. Creepy as all hell but holy shit it got terrified and excited. Terrxited? Excitified? &&Screambear? Of course they're talking about Screambear&&Yeah, that's the one. I was not expecting it to be so brutal and just downright creepy. &&Great, now I’m scared to go back to sleep. &&Reminded me of a similar scene in Made in Abyss.&&The scene where they find the video the previous soldiers made was creepy as fuck. Then when they discovered the body? How often are things both beautiful and horrifying to see?&&That thing not having a face creeped me the fuck out. &&It creeped me out more than any horror film I have seen come out in years, so I loved Annihilation.&&And it's not even tagged as horror.. I loved it so much but at the same time I regret having watched it&&Someone gilded this whole comment thread lol.&&Well, i don't think that was it. I think Annihilation failed at the box office because of all of the trouble it had with the studios not believing in it. There was a lot of shit behind the scenes to keep it true to Alex Garlands vision and it really didn't get a marketing push or chance at the box office. Instead it got sold off.&&""Backlash-backlash"" is great way to describe that.

I didn't see Ghostbuster 2016 until it was streaming, and I thought it was a completely serviceable ""fun"" movie. It wasn't great and I have complaints with both the story and the jokes, but it wasn't the 1/10 that half of the internet claimed it was.

I assume that it's sexist of me to say that Hemsworth was the best part, though, so I'll take my downvotes where I can get them.&&I saw it in a Dolby Theater. That soundtrack is gold. Reminded me of. Arrival. &&Which was a shame that everyone outside of the US never got that option&&Yeah I can understand your point there... It was designed for a cinema experience. Though, people having mini cinema's in their own homes is becoming more and more common. &&I didn't even know it was out at the cinema to be honest. I watched it on Netflix a few weeks back. &&I'm almost glad I missed it in theaters. That scene in the abandoned house in full Dolby Digital surround sound sound would have been pants soilingly terrifying! Purposefully vague for spoilers but you know what I'm talking about. &&You belong in a museum &&Yeah. 1st was awesome. 3rd was pretty good. 2nd was trying to be too clever for its own good.&&Never claimed it was.  It's a rat pack movie, it was basically an way for them to get paid to get drunk and do drugs lol.

The Oceans 11 remake was a great heist movie.  &&Well, it was so they could focus on space things and not ""other"" things. &&1. Go to Wikipedia.   
2. Look up George Foreman.   
3. Read about his kids.    &&If it wasn't for this Reddit threat I never would have heard of it. 

Which goes to show that Redditors can be great marketing assets. &&I haven't seen it yet but a friend of mine was really annoyed that the scientists just entered the alien environment without any suits or masks or any kind of respiratory protection.  He's Navy and can't fathom a situation where they would not have taken even the smallest of precautions. Looking forward to having the time to watch this tho. It looked interesting.

Edit.  Thank you for all the replies.  I'm now looking forward to seeing this movie this weekend. Love reddit, very happy to have joined. &&You did, because it did.&&> Of course, Ghostbusters made $230 million worldwide, and that's why they do remakes.

Ghostbusters (2016) fell $70million short of breaking even.  Sure, production cost them $140million and they made $230million... but they spent like $150million marketing the damn thing.&&You have a fair point there. Though I would point out that Ghostbusters cost 144 million to make where as Atomic Blonde only cost 30 million. Comparatively Ghostbusters still comes out on top but no where near as good of a return. &&Ghostbusters also cost over a hundred million dollars more than Atomic Blonde and millions in marketing.

Did people show up because ""brand XYZ + women"" or did people show up because news about it was all over the place and ridiculous amounts were spent on marketing? Variety estimates over $100MM in marketing... over three times the production budget of Atomic Blonde. Meanwhile it actually made less revenue than Ghostbusters 1 even before adjusting for inflation, and Ghostbusters 1 had a budget of $30MM. I'm not buying this idea that slapping a brand on a movie immediately equals ticket sales.&&Not forgetting the total shit storm surrounding Ghostbusters that did an awful lot of damage to the IP, that and it not being funny and getting mostly bad reviews (from people who I know that saw it).&&Last I heard there were talks of a sequel? It was a well made movie. Charlize Theron is hitting some new peak in her career. Yeah I just think it is a movie that needs to be watched a bunch of times to truly get. Im not gonna lie and say that I fully understood it when I watched it the first time. &&[removed]&&Nah I understand. Im just coming from the casual sci fi fan perspective. I think it was a subtle movie peppered with bombastic moments. &&It’s a rebootquel. It’s trying to restart the franchise while also building onto the series. 

&&That's what I think, too. It doesn't mean dick if an individual movie fails, but when lots of them fail it's certainly something to note.&&And that’s the point of the Bechdel test. 

Not so much “this one particular movie failed therefore it’s bad” but more “look at all these movies that have failed, that is a bad trend”. &&A good experiment to do is a reverse Bechdel Test in your head for movies too. See how many movies don't pass a gender flipped version. I've yet to find more than a handful that don't pass within the first five minutes, even movies that people say are really female focused usually manage it.&&My favourite movie concerning the Bechel test is Life of Brian, because it only passes the Bechdel test because of the scene where Judith speaks to Eric Idle about Eric Idle's character claiming (solely for comedic effect) that he now wants to be thought of as a woman called Loretta, in order to have babies. &&Yup. The Bechdel Test isn't something you should be proud of passing, it's something you should be ashamed of failing.

Edit: there are always exceptions, of course. That's a given.&&>o the people saying that pushing the all\-female cast is an ""unfair"" marketing gimmick, c'mon. It's a totally fair marketing trend that's existed forever.

totally agree, people seem to have forgotten that the Oceans 11 tag line promoted that it was 11 men \(which apparently is totally fine\)

*3 Casinos. 11 Guys. 150 Million Bucks. Ready To Win Big?*&&Seriously. I really don't get the issue here. This is like only the second major all-female cast reboot in recent years that I've heard of, but OP is acting like it's some huge trend that's ruining movies. I heard the same silly arguments for Black Panther. Like, how insecure are you if it just takes one all-black cast blockbuster or two all-female cast blockbusters to get you to start raving about how ""forcing diversity"" is some huge problem? How many blockbusters have there been where all the main roles are guys? The complaining comes off as sour grapes to me by people who think ""too much diversity"" is a big deal. There's been plenty of movies with strong female leads, so who cares if there's the occasional all female cast? Don't see a reason to get even remotely upset by that. &&Yep, the original is from 1960 and the cast included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin

https://imdb.com/title/tt0054135/?ref=m_nv_sr_6&&That's sort of my point. If anything, Ocean's 8 is way less derivative than Ocean's 11 was, which was a straight up remake.

It's kind of hilarious to me that OP is saying ""why are they remaking Ocean's 11, when they could just make a new IP"" when the entire existence of the 2000s Oceans movies is using a pre-existing IP.


It also just seems like a question with an obvious answer, doesn't it? ""Why are we getting an Ocean's movie with female protagonists?"" Probably because we've already seen like 8 million heist movies full of dudes and this is at least an original/interesting change from that. Did we really need a 4th all dude Ocean's movie instead?&&Why does Hollywood insist on remaking a movie with a more ethnic cast rather than creating a new movie with strong ethnic leads? ~ */r/movies, ca. 2000*&&And one of the characters was living in the house Robin Williams's character built. &&I really enjoyed the new one, honestly probably was more likely to see it because it was linked to old IP even though I knew it was vastly different.

It is also an interesting example. It was just considered a reboot with 2 male and 2 female leads. (When you add in the antagonist and the extra help picked up along the way, really 4 top billed guys and 2 ladies).  

If they had replaced those 2 ladies with 2 more guys, it would have still just been called a reboot, not an ""all male reboot"" (even though the kids in the original were one boy one girl). Maybe ""an adults reboot.""  

But if they went the other way and had all four protagonists female, it would have been panned as a pandering ""all female reboot.""

There is still a double standard in that male driven movies are just ""movies"" while female driven movies are ""female led movies.""

You make 3 primarily male oceans 11 reboots/sequels and nobody minds. You make 1 of them female driven and it is ""pandering"" rather than ""a new interesting cast"".

As people are saying here, IP sells. And the truth is that most existing IP over the years has been white and male. So if you want to use old IP and newer sensibilities of diversity in roles... you are going to end up with plenty of people annoyed.

Edit: also... it was pointed out that there were 3 male leads and one female. Jack Black apparently did such a great job channeling his character that my mind placed it as two male and two female leads. Honest (though perhaps telling) mistake.&&wait what? I thought jumanji was original? that's one of my favorite robin williams movies.  I didn't realize it was a remake

edit: through the power of google, I get it now. I'm so fucking out of the loop. &&They also missed why the Ghostbusters works not just as a comedy, but as a *film*. It's engaging because it's a realistic take on schlubby guys starting a business, using the framing of the supernatural as a twist. IMO, a realistic look at women struggling to get recognized in academia would have been a fantastic premise to build an all female Ghostbusters on, that could have been the realistic grounding which the movie stood on AND really made it a movie for younger women to look up to.

Yet, the movie we got teases that (early on in the film I remember that coming up for a flash) and then fails to have ANY realistic grounding. This is probably because there was no firm grounding *period*, which started with no clear ideas in the writing. It's a structure with no foundation, while the original film has one of the most strong foundations of any comedy script of it's time.&&It's true your honor, the new Ghostbusters have no dicks.&&Also, Ghostbusters was never really a fart joke dumb action kind of thing, I dont think these people ever bothered watching the original.&&I thought it was fine. I would have preferred the daughter of ghostbuster direct sequel idea that was floating around. but it was fine for what it is.

one thing it did do however was get my kids interested in ghostbusters and they went on to watch the original films and enjoyed them too.&&Well, the original was PG.. I can't recall if that is the one that showed boobs.  PG-13 should be enough to do anything you want inside of that world.  That is assuming the rating system hasn't been ""tightened down"" over the years.  I've been an adult for a long time and the rating is meaningless to me in regards to my decision to watch a movie or not so I really don't pay attention to it any longer.&&To add to that, when people would criticize it for what ever reason, it was because we were just a bunch of sexist men, even the director jumped on that band wagon. So people discarded it because they were deflecting criticism with the fact that it was an all female cast. 
Also in their attempt to make a statement of equality, they used the old film formula that feminists hate, where the opposite sex is portrayed as dumb and attractive.&&Yeah, but at least the characters were funny in the original&&Totally agree&&Make a character, then decide the gender, can't be that fucking hard.&&Check out Parker posey playing Dr. Smith in the new Lost in Space. She pulled out a very rich complex yet flawed character portrayal as part of a gender swap and fucking NAILED it. &&Totally. And also that the character has agency ... that's the other big thing.&&I couldn't agree more. ""Strong"" has been twisted to mean ""flawless badass"". Nowadays a female character can't be weak, or shy, or cowardly, or dull, or any other unflattering characteristic without the movie being called misogynistic. *But that's how some women are in real life*. Hell everyone, make or female, is that way at some point in their lives. But no, nowadays every female character has to be ""strong"". &&Indeed. I always strongly dislike seeing a female character described as strong and it's nearly always strong.

Can a woman not be weak, not be fragile?

Can a woman not have fears, doubts, be wrong and struggle?

I feel Rey didn't struggle enough in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.

She had some struggle with Kylo in TFA and an internal struggle with Kylo and Luke in TLJ.

She struggled with Snoke in TLJ.

But I don't know, she's just a bit too powerful compared to how Luke was in the Original Trilogy, or even perhaps Yoda at times, or Obi-Wan in ANH.&&Yeah they wanted string female characters who actually impacted the story instead of just being around the men ergo moved the story.  Unfortunately producers didn't understand that and we got catwoman, who is technically strong but so poorly written she's a terrible character anyway. The meaninf changes over time becauas of characters like that&&shit nibba i forgot to watch this in theatre :(&&Kylo is the best character in those movies, I absolutely don't understand people who don't like him.&&From the get-go I had a problem with Rey being good at everything, mainly her light saber skills when fighting Kylo Ren, who is a very powerful Jedi/Sith. No matter how strong Rey is with the force, her basically beating Kylo was absurd to me and still is. I haven't seen episode 8 yet so don't ruin it for me. Hell, even Fin holding his own against Kylo was dumb too.&&The moment I really hated most was when Rey went to the Dark Side cave, and there was nothing there for her. Because she’s a perfect pure pristine unimpeachable snowflake of perfection. That was one of my biggest “oh, fuck off” moments of The Last Jedi. 

I feel like there needed to be something on offer for Rey to reject. Desire to help her friends. Fear of what she could become. An offer of strength to help ‘save’ the galaxy. Something. Instead, she sees herself in a mirror. There was no sense of temptation that came across for me.&&She bought her max level account.&&No that's Lady and the Tramp&&I thought it was pudding&&Let’s actually name them. For research.&&Bwahaaha&&You sharp motherfucker. &&I'm gonna buy a private screening for myself &&""On one hand, if this were true I'd be annoyed with Hollywood trying to remake EVERY movie with female leads because 'Muh vaginuh' feminism.

I haven't laughed that hard in a while. &&Stop, I can only get so hard!&&hey its me ur lesbian&&Ugh, I hate test audiences. I understand the premise and the idea is a good one, but I feel like they are used to replace good decision making. If following their studies results in a failure then everyone can point to the test audience as a scapegoat and avoid any responsibility for their own part in it. &&Part of what made the female ghost busters so visible was the controversy that arose from people, rightfully, not wanting Hollywood to exploit a beloved movie from our childhood “cuz muh feminism” which had a lot of people come out just so they could trash on it without people being able to say “how can you criticize it if you haven’t seen it”. Where as annihilation had zero controversy and no source material/nostalgia to ruin. &&[deleted]&&That Angelina Jolie is one tough broad.  

Edit: Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron, maybe Emily Blunt.&&That's another coup for marketing depts.  All the people that grew up on certain movies and shows are now adults - with or without kids, so it's easy to tap into the nostalgia vein with reboots and remakes.&&But that was his point, more people are going to be willing to see it. If that movie wasn’t “Jumanji” it would be considered another movie with a lot of CGI with the Rock filled with Kevin Hart shenanigans. Not many people would be willing to see that.&&Funny story, I was telling my s/o about the original magnificent seven and I brought up Steve McQueen.

Hollywood doesn't believe in female\-fronted action/genre films, and it always shows in their marketing. The reason it seems like every film is getting a female reboot is because they want to try to jump on the WW bandwagon but don't have faith to launch a new IP with female leads.&&Dumped in February too, traditionally where the worst shit comes out. Annihilation should have gotten the giant summer Blockbuster push, Nat Port hosting SNL, all that. She's a bankable star, and that movie should have been a hit if anybody had heard of it&&Doesn't help that it went straight to streaming in many areas. The studios really had no faith, but we get all kinds of mediocre garbage in theaters over here. I would've definitely gone to see it on a big screen if I could've, even for a second time after seeing it on Netflix. Not that I thought it was perfect but it was very good, and the kind of a weird scifi movie that we rarely get.&&The only 'Arrival' vibes I got were sci-fi with a female lead. Outside of that, they're basically opposite approaches to both the first-contact genre and film as a whole.

Both got an A from me, though.&&But at the same time kind of lucky that Netflix picked it up and it was available to stream only a few days after its US cinema release. It was advertised heavily on the Australian Netflix homepage. Without Netflix nowhere else would have seen it.&&It really is. I had to drive 90 miles to see it in a theater, but at least I had the option to do that.

It's still a great film, but the rollout is depressing.&&True! And I really think that you're right that it'll be one of those movies that people will put on and find themselves engaged by. It's much less of a commitment to click on a thumbnail than it is to buy a ticket at the theater.

Sad that it didn't do so well in theaters, but it happens!&&Are you outside of the USA? I know that the film got a theatrical release in the USA and a direct to streaming in several other markets.

It might've only released in cinema in the USA to my knowledge, honestly.&&Is that the one where Julia Roberts plays someone who looks like Julia Roberts?&&I only just heard of it in this thread...&&>	If it wasn’t for this Reddit threat

If you don’t watch that film I’m going to downvote the shit out of you...
&&This was my problem with Alien Covenant! ""The air is breathable"" does not equal ""we are okay to not wear any safety equipment the first time we leave the spaceship after a massive expensive (and costly) journey across the cosmos to an unknown planet"" &&I think in the movie people had been sent inside before these women. They had been testing the bubble for years. So I’d guess they were aware that protection wouldn’t help &&But they had tested the atmosphere. They knew the air was safe to breathe... &&They made a looooooot of foolish decisions during the movie. &&Ghostbusters fell far more than $70mil short of breaking even, but to this date Sony won't admit it. Sadly the numbers and basic math don't lie. 

It cost $144mil production plus approx $100mil marketing = $244mil. Studios only get about half of the box office take, so it had to make $488mil box office for it to break even for Sony. Those numbers add up because Paul Feig himself said in the run up to release that it needed to make $500mil to be a success and he considered that ""low end"", and yet no sooner had he said that, Sony started saying he was over exaggerating. &&They don't get all of that money.  They lost more than that because they are not the only ones that get a piece of the revenue.  &&Ghostbusters lost a ton of money.&&No amount of marketing could have made me see that movie. The trailers just put me off the whole thing so bad.&&Theron confirmed a sequel. It was a good action movie, the plot was a bit convulated but the action scenes were great. Hope they keep Leitch on as director&&Yeah, it was never meant to be a red stamp of failure not to pass. More a way to examine a trend, which can then open up conversation as to why that's happening so often when its something that should be so easy. Something that IS so easy for male characters to pass almost all of the time.&&It really comes down to the fact that in pop-culture, ""straight, white, cis, male"" is the default. Unless you have a story reason to make your character something else, it always defaults to that.&&No the Bechdel test like many other things people complain about isn't something that shows whether the movie is good or bad, it showcase a problematic trend more than a problematic movie.&&Exactly. And, to my knowledge, Ocean's 8 isn't even a reboot. It's a spin-off with Clooney's character's sister as the main character. It's literally just another film in the series, following up on an established plot point.&&Also, the all female cast of an Oceans movie sounds like a fun idea. Why isn’t “fun idea” enough of a reason?&&Its not even a reboot. Its just a film using the Oceans franchise world. Its like saying all marvel films are 'reboots', even though they are different stories and different characters, but in the same universe&&Neat, never knew.&&Yeah I liked that subtle reference, had no issue with the new Jumanji at all actually it was a fresh take on it and fun to watch.&&So I shouldn't tell you about the movie that's essentially [Jumanji in Space?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406375/)&&.&&It's also because a lot of the reason Ghostbusters' humor works so well is because of the dynamics of the characters' interactions onscreen. It's a lot like the original Men in Black. The interactions between J and K are hilarious, and all the sequels failed to recreate their chemistry. It seems like in the Ghostbusters reboot, they sort of tried to meet the same character archetypes and dynamics (though they're missing a Venkman style charlatan) and failed because the actors and actresses just don't have the same kind of chemistry that the original cast had.&&Why is it the only male employee of the new Ghostbusters team is played as a blundering idiot, seemingly hired because he’s good looking. 

I know it’s flipping the stereotype of ditzy female secretaries but the original Ghostbusters had Janine who was never portrayed as stupid and was actually competent at her job. 

I can’t even remember Hemsworths characters name. He’s just a pointless two dimensional character that exists so some SJWs can watch the movie and say “HA HA, PRETTY MAN IS STUPID”&&I also feel like they don't do enough actual Ghostbusting. The second act of the original Ghostbusters where they start catching lots of ghosts, including the montage, does a lot to set up the premise that these guys are getting good at what they do. In the reboot, they go to the metal show, and then suddenly the entire city is overrun and they're the big heroes. The arc was too steep to be engaging.&&The fact that this ""girl power"" film only had men working on the script and production, and the only women involved were the actresses...
&&That comment is funnier than the whole movie was. &&Well that's what I heard!&&*I wrote it all out, then – trying to be a guy working with a studio – I was talking about an early idea we had, about ghosts of aliens from other worlds. But I wrote, ""in a billion dollar idea""*

A quote from a [2016 Paul Feig interview](http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/paul-feig/41940/paul-feig-interview-ghostbusters-the-web-sony/page/0/1), since the whole premise of  Ghostbusters was a building designed to channel ghosts from another world, I think it's pretty solid evidence the these people never bothered watching the original.
&&How well the humor in comedies can carry over to Chinese\foreign audiences is now a major factor. &&And they will still make more money than most people have ever seen in their lives.

Race and gender can be important to a characters identity and position in the plot, the problem with Hollywood is that it often becomes the only thing of note for the character. &&very good at being unlikable.&&I've seen her described as a bit of a mary-sue character which I have to agree with. I couldn't even really tell you much about personality or character.    
  
Hermione Granger (in the books at least) was more of a 'strong' character in this sense. She was pretty annoying and bossy at times and sometimes lacked empathy or patience. But equally she could *not* be those things, they weren't all that defined her, they weren't ever-present.   
As she grew up and had more experience you saw her gain new traits but some of her older ones would still come out from time to time. She wasn't perfect, but she did good and she felt real :)
  
&&From what I’ve seen at least, it looks like the majority of people who dislike Kylo Ren are the people who dislike ANY villain character because “villains are bad and you should feel bad for liking villains because villains are bad”&&>  I haven't seen episode 8 yet so don't ruin it for me

There's nothing I can do to ruin that movie that Rian Johnson hasn't already done.&&They had a few scenes showing Chewie's bowcaster basically obliterate anybody hit with it. Kylo Ren had just taken a hit with it when he was fighting. Him even being able to survive that, let alone stand up and fight at all was actually a pretty impressive feat. 

I'm more annoyed by her already being great at everything and everybody instantly loving her.&&Rey's biggest fear is being alone and that's what the cave showed her. Her greatest weakness is a naive search for any sort of human connection. Kylo berates her for looking to Solo as a father in TFA, Snoke pulls her in using Kylo in TLJ and Kylo again berates her for looking to Skywalker as a father figure. &&No, you're thinking of Gummo.&&Start with Carol (drama with extended-cut I think), Kiss Myg (one of my favorites), and Imagine Me and You (British comedy with a familiar plot)

He didn't listen to test audience or studio input so we got 100% his exact vision of the movie.&&Marvel apparently uses a test audience of current directors and friends and family that the directors trust. That's pretty crazy since that seems like an extreme circlejerk of themselves, but clearly it works a majority of the time. &&I know right. If an entire crew of seasoned, professional filmmakers are happy with the final cut of the film, who cares what some unemployed \(because let's face it, they must be\) hicks from bumfuck think about it?&&Seriously..it was a pretty damn niche film even as far as sci fi goes.

We had  Blade Runner 2049  which had a well known cast,great director ,a well established IP and good publicity..

It tanked at the cinemas because it was a long film that many people didn't really ""get""..

Hard sci fi doesn't sell.&&> and wasn't given an overseas theatrical release.

Ohh, that explains that, I thought I'd missed it.&&An R rated movie with virtually no marketing that was shoved out to die in just the USA alone right after a massive blockbuster still made 32 million. Just think how much it could have made released September, at the same time as Arrival, and given some real press. 

I doubt it would have made as much as Arrival, but it could have made a lot more.&&Not only was it an MCU movie that crosses $1 billion it did that *as an unproven property* and a solo hero film. That makes that feat even more impressive and even further explains its domination of Annihilation. BP was the conversation at the time, and nothing was going to stand up to it realistically.&&>Sorry, but I've seen a lot of people using Annihilation to smugly say, ""well, I guess diversity and strong female characters don't sell after all,"" and it's nonsense. 

Well, I'm not saying that. Movies don't sell for all sorts of stupid reasons, but Annihilation's failure at the box office had nothing to do with it's female-centered cast.

Paramount fucked it's marketing and release. 

I'm just saying the kind of people who like to get loud about such things just didn't for it, when, if they're looking for a good example of how to make a strong female cast, they should have.

Really, the movie could have been done with all guys, all white, all straight and reasonably macho, and it could have worked about as well. It doesn't remind us over and over that it's all women, it doesn't really use ""females"" as a way to drive the plot, or ""this character is gay, gotta do something with that"", or anything like that... it was about as perfect as it could be in how it should be done, and there wasn't the same sort of noise about it. Obviously only major blockbusters deserve that noise...&&Charlize Theron, definitely Charlize Theron.

Although now that I think about it, I wonder how much of my reaction to that name is on the actress, and how much of it is because she had George fucking Miller directing her in the role that immediately came to mind? Maybe ScarJo could actually pull off that kind of grit and toughness if she were working with a director who was less interested in how many horny teenage boys she'd pull in than whoever cast her as Black Widow, and more interested in the actual character?&&No maybe on Emily Blunt, she's tough as fuck. I'd say more so than Scarlett, and edges out Charlize. She's super imposing in Edge of Tomorrow.&&I mean, I go and see everything with the Rock just because it's got the Rock and all his films are hilarious and terrible in exactly the right way. &&Just having The Rock in the cast will get people in the theater. &&I hope she's of age...&&Ah, I just woke up and realized my comment was gilded and got super excited lol.

I prefer the cinema experience but there's something special about watching a movie on release in the comfort of your own home. I didn't feel like I was missing out with the audio considering my soundbar does a decent enough job with sound. &&I just think it is a movie that needs time to find its fan base. I personally didn't get it when I watched it the first time... but I'll revisit it at some stage. It is going to be one of those movies that people need to pick apart and think about before they can offer their true opinion on it.&&And Bruce Willis played Bruce Willis talking to Julia Roberts pretending to be a Julia Roberts lookalike.&&Yep&&That whole fucking movie was one bad mistake after another. I seriously doubt anyone of those idiots actually held a degree in their respective fields. 

The ship is saying don't go below a certain range, well let's go below it because fuck you what do you know computer that makes life or death decisions for you? Oh this is wheat, exactly like the wheat on earth? How the fuck do you know that just by touching/looking at it as is. Also why the fuck are you just touching it.  &&Both COVENANT and PROMETHEUS leans into the idea that they might be scientists but they're not exactly smart. More the latter one. Although I'm pretty sure there's a quick bit of throwaway dialouge to say they've tested the air. &&Yeah... they were studying it for months.. &&It was propped up by great performances all round. Action movies suffered a lull in the early 2000's . The Russo brothers put it best I think, and I am paraphrasing here but they said something along the lines of ""The action needs to develop the plot otherwise the audience gets bored very quickly""... &&Yeah, the plot was pretty lame as far as I'm concerned - predictable, uninspired, yet still overwritten - yet the elements that really matter for an action movie were absolutely phenomenal. That long edit for the apartment building fight was incredible, and having seen what went on behind the scenes (and how Theron did so many of her own stunts) it's even more impressive.&&I’m excited to see it and honestly the cast is so killer that even if they’d just randomly settled on it rather than deciding upfront to cast it as all-female, I would still buy it. All of those people feel like they should be in a heist movie&&Because a lot of redditors dislike women&&The remake was superior, the pacing of the original was meandering with lots of long shots that broke up the momentum.&&Yeah, new Jumanji was fun.

All of the acting in it is solid, but he really stole the spotlight for me.&&Well to be fair zathura had the same author as jumanji and polar express &&A lot of modern filmmakers think a movie is a series of set pieces.&&Great. There's a producer trolling the replies somewhere out there, so get ready for,  ""Women in Black"".&&Plinkett basically explained why the movie failed.

I'll freely admit that tried to do ""Girl Power"" in a totally condescending way and in way which was shitting on men a little though TBH&&Umm.. you might want to look at those writing credits again.

Katie Dippold co-wrote the movie with Feig. She also wrote ""The Heat.""&&It was written by Katie Dippold as well as Paul Feig. &&Not really. If the movie was about the female experience, you would be right to a good degree, but Ghostbusters was a sci-fi comedy. They failed on the sci-fi comedy. That's why it was shit. It was just a cashgrab trying to use a classic IP with current social trends.

Look at Annihilation. Good sci-fi movie with an all female cast, but it got completely overlooked. AND it was made by a dude.

Circlejerking to current social trends to try to make a quick buck is not how you make a good movie. Even the marketing was sad virtue signaling.

It's why I'm not looking forward to Ocean's 8, even though the lore is there and I adore Sandra Bullock. Just seems like another cashgrab.

I am looking forward to Captain Marvel because the MCU folks know how to make a good movie while being inclusive (see: Black Panther).&&Human sacrifices, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria! &&Yeah.. thats the main reason all these horrible remakes happen, and why the writing always seems weird like everyone talks un naturally,  everything is overexplained the the nth degree. Carol Anne talking to static isnt enough, we need a bunch of hands pressing on the inside of a hd flat panel screen to make it clear that there are ghosts, ugh.... &&Scream scream scream tits scream scream&&God, I wanted to slap that bitch in the teeth in every scene.

Very well done.&&I supported this. My friend was mad that Rey beat Kylo that easily but I argued that Kylo was basically dying for half the fight.

But now that TLJ has set up Kylo as the big bad I have a problem with it.

Why should I be worried that Rey won't win? She aces every obstacle in her path and has already beaten him; sure it made sense, but narratively the protagonist already has bested the antagonist. Then on a meta level you know the good guys are gonna win, it's the last film and is directed by JJ Abrams, no way they lose unless they want to keep Kylo around as a bad guy for a Sequel Sequel Trilogy.&&Damn, she really is a Mary Sue isnt she?&&""On one hand, if this were true I'd be annoyed with Hollywood trying to remake EVERY movie with female leads because 'Muh vaginuh' feminism.

With no training at all, she's able to use multiple force techniques that took Luke months or years to learn. She wins a lightsaber duel against someone who has been training for years (Though his injuries at least make this reasonable, it still adds to a bad pattern with her. I'd have had Finn take this one, as he's at least a trained soldier). Then, Leia instantly loves her and even hugs her instead of Chewie after Han dies.

heh&&2 Broke 2 Mountain.&&Yippee ki gay motherfucker. &&My friend ran those for ten+ years, and while I don't know how larger ones went, I was in a smaller test screening once. Just a bunch of regular people, nobody was stupid or ignorant. We discussed the film's pacing, themes, and plot, then answered a questionairre. My friend's job wasn't to care what we say but to ask enough questions that the studio can understand how things came across.

Honestly, pacing and editing seemed like the main thing we discussed. ""Oh, I thought the guy was talking to his mother, and only when it changed shots did I realize he was talking to his girlfriend"". Now the filmmakers and studios knows to re-work that scene so it's more obvious which off-screen character the on-screen character is talking to. If they don't have the footage to re-work this well enough, they'll have to re-shoot.

Test audiences are a convenient thing to blame, but if they didn't exist, I'm sure you'd see the difference immediately.&&...And, not ALL of AEon Flux was terrible. Most of it, but not ALL of it.

The original film was not at all condescending toward women. Janine was strong and didn't put up with shit from the GB crew, Dana Barrett an independent musician with a Manhattan pentouse, I do not understand why they chose this direction for the reboot. Even the original film painted Venkman as a charlatan asshole but evened that out with the other guys. I really don't understand why they chose to make the GB reboot a piece of SJW bullshit. &&They did that with Luke though in the OT.  Outfits became darker over the three films as they tried to show the tug of the darkside on Luke.  No way Disney makes their Star Wars princess go to the dark side.

But when I saw ""There Will Be Blood"", that is a whole other horror genre - everyone walking around, being hearty capitalists, exploiting the Earth, exploiting the Simple, the naive, and exploiting children. 

Danial Day Lewis is such a master of the craft to play this horrid sociopath, and then turn around a few years later and play a realistic Lincoln. 

This, IMO, is one of the creepiest movie scenes ever because it happens in REAL LIFE all the time - all kinds of people and companies seek to steal our money. Constantly.

I really do. However... It has the same issue I have with a lot of movies. The first half is better than the second half.

I'd argue Full Metal Jacket is another example. And while not in the same league as those, Super Troopers, Slap Shot, Boon Dock and almost every Spiderman movie.

My true favorites are the ones that build up for the climax. With DDL in mind, Last of the Mohicans.&&Uh, it's a fun movie to watch with two of my favourite actors but ""absolute perfection"" is not how I would describe it&&Meh. It seemed silly and completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief. I love some historical stuff. But it just came off as ridiculous.

Maybe, possibly, it was sort of accurate in how brutal things were. But if things were that brutal, the people living in that environment would have adapted. Rich people would have bodyguards and the mayor would not be getting into arguments with the local crime boss without a serious game plan.&&I drink your milkshake?&&I would have to agree, however, his roles in last of the mohicans and there will be blood are equally amazing imo.

 In fact all of his roles are truly great, hard to really pinpoint&&""Daniel Day Lewis isn't an intense person. Really he's not. He's actually THE MOST intense person, who has ever lived!""&&I love him so much I know his name is spelled Tompkins!

I'd love to understand some of the reasoning and approach of this movie if anyone wants to share! &&what roger ebert said about Ron Leibman Night Falls On Manhattan character could be said for DDL in gangs NY

I have Irish ancestors from that time in the Bowery. It pretty much depicts how the Irish were treated inn”the new world” during that time.

From old stories of my great uncles and grandmother(and their family of 11 children) It appears to kinda fit together to me.

That whole opening scene? The discordant music as they march through the warrens under New York, to emerge into the snow? Those speeches from Bill the Butcher and Priest Vallon? That battle, and Bill's proclamations afterward? That might be the *best goddamn opening scene in all of cinema*. I could watch those ten minutes or so on a loop for the rest of my life. *They are perfect*.&&It’s a crime against humanity that he lost the Oscar to Adrien Brody that year. &&There will be blood was pretty good as well.

I've just crunched the numbers on your statement.
The film has a runtime of 2h48m
This times a million gives you roughly 280,0000 hours
This rounded up is 116,667 days
Which is 319 years.

The film was released December 20, 2002
so if you had been watching it non-stop since release (which is impossible as you would not be able to satisfy your bodily needs such as sleep, food, toilet etc)
you would only have seen it 801 times.

YOU SIR, ARE A LIAR!!
&&As an Irishman, I am not sure if it would be offensive or not.

It's one of the best movies to watch in Blu-ray. &&Pores are for filthy irishmen&&Yeah it's very engrossing.

I don't play it so much anymore for that very reason.

I used the chef costume wuth black dye and hid the hat so it looks exactly like a butchers costume.

I also have the wedding suit.

I made him as tall and gangly as possible and the face amd hair is very close.&&Good bot&&Freal&&That's what I did and couldn't find one so I commented &&That makes way more sense. But now I definitely want it  forever to be potpourri &&I do not mean it in a bad way.  I think DDL is an exceptional actor, and this was a beautiful performance.   What I mean, is the movie would still have been amazing if he had played a serious, all business character (Don Corleone for example) but his nihilistic unhinged, violent,  antisocial character was made more relatable by his batshit craziness.  Over annunciation,  over the top physical expressionism.  Basically Jim Carrey's entire career is overacting,  but it's tough to make it work in a dramatic setting &&I always had the feeling that the movie was meant to be over the top, but DDL's performance is so legit that it breaks the ridiculousness and actually draws you in. So it actually creates a pretty unique atmosphere...it's over the top, but he makes it almost believable. 

It's uncomfortable and unsettling. I think that's a big part of what makes the movie great, though many people think the exact opposite.&&Kenneth Branaugh (sp?) In Wild Wild West with Will Smith and Kevin Kline.  Beautifully overacted.  Also... both Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman in the Fifth Element.  All some of my favorites.&&Jim Carrey is a notorious overactor as a comedian. Think of the comedy and tragedy masks - histrionic laughter and wretched sorrow. Overacting is big and loud and obvious. &&Slack Jaw was his name I believe.&&Nice, and not surprising at all.&&Damn shame. Sarah Polley is phenomenal.&&Dude!

You're Tyler Durden drawings are kick fuckin ass!
I will definitely be PM'ing you for something soon.&&There's more than that. I love it too but if you take out DDL I don't see it being anywhere near as good as it is.&&The jump cut right before DiCaprio stabs the pig is what really killed it for me.&&I have an irrational fear that I'll poke out my eyes at any given point of time. The thought of someone tapping a knife against their eye makes my whole body tense up&&I wouldn't have been surprised to learn that DDL had his eye surgically removed for the role. &&I'd surprisingly not heard that piece of trivia, what a fucking badass. &&Ive been a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis since his epic performance in The Last of the Mohicans. &&Daniel Day Lewis is famous as a Method actor, and the glass eye business is awesome, but point of order: that particular action is technically a stunt; it’s not Method acting. 

[“Method” acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting) is a collection of techniques used by an actor to connect with his/her own emotions and identify them with the character s/he is portraying. 

It was pioneered by a theatre director named Konstantin Stanislavski, and developed by Americans named Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler in the political (socialist) theatre of 1930s New York. 

It promotes a mentally and emotionally realistic performance, and so it came along at a perfect time as the requirements of acting were transitioning from a broader style suited for the opera house and vaudeville, to something more suited to a new technology: the intimate gaze of the moving picture camera. 

Method is interesting because it engages your whole mind, including your unconscious (the part you don’t “hear” thinking rationally) and your whole body into inhabiting a fictional space. It can elicit such a close identification with your character that your performance takes creative turns you never could have planned, because you’re thinking and feeling like a person in a different circumstance from your own. 

The thing with the glass eye is awesome, and it shows true dedication and determination of the kind Daniel Day Lewis is famous for, but it’s the opposite of some action that arises naturally out of identifying with your character. 

The glass eye is a costume choice, and tapping it with the knife is an effective bit of business, but tapping your eye with a knife is not a natural action no matter how immersed you are! 

It’s a stunt, like falling off a burning building. Something more dangerous than an actor would do without special equipment. Rather than just impulsively choosing that action because it felt right in the moment (which is what Method acting is good at), he would have had to decide to do this stunt, either from his own creative impulse or as a direction from his director, learn to do it safely, and then practice and practice until it felt like a natural thing that Bill the Butcher would do. 
&&> had his own eyeball covered in prosthetic glass

I have to assume this is referring to a glass contact lens, because ""eyeball covered in prosthetic glass"" cannot be processed by my layman brain.&&While that is a badass anecdote, does it actually constitute ""Method"" acting?  I thought method acting was living and breathing as your character on a 24/7 basis throughout all preparation and filming.  

This seems more like a dedication to the art of film than actual method acting?  

I'm truly asking because DDL's, for lack of a better word, methods to get into character have always fascinated me. &&Definitely a man dedicated to his craft.

I actually thought it was cg in the movie when he did it, because I thought there's no way an actor would be crazy enough to do that shit.&&Came here to say this. 

For me, there is something about the ‘mine’ (rather than ‘my’) that is chilling. &&>Ok yeah but The Will be Blood I think gave Lewis more room to reach toward his potential.

He didn't even just change accents. His whole cadence was different as he delivered it, and it sounded completely natural. Like, *knowing* he is the same guy being actual-him and playing the character, if he and the character were side by side having a conversation my brain would register it as two separate people still.

It wasn't just conventional acting, to me; he basically manifested a fictional person into existence.&&There will be blood was a much better movie. But for me, Bill the Butcher was a better character. Also Paul Dano > Leo in those films. &&I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE&&Lewis is at his best when he plays tense people who look like they could about to explode at any time and kill you.&&There Will Be Blood was much more cerebral&&>That might be the best goddamn opening scene in all of cinema.

exciting the way DDL speaks

 i love the way Magua cant argue it he has to just stand there and stay silent  &&Well fuck, TIL.&&Thank you!

Most of what people think are ""method acting"" is absolutely nothing like it. The term has been so bastardized by actors doing these oft repeated stunts and things \(filing their teeth to look like a hobo, fucking with your weight, putting on an accent, staying in character 24/7 etc\) in the name of ""method"" that I'd wager half of the actors doing that shit today don't even know what it's supposed to mean or have even heard of Stanislavski, Strasberg or Adler.

DDL is arguably one of the greatest actors ever lived, but the shit he does that's advertised as ""method"" has nothing to do with method acting. It's a conscious choice and may be used as a setup for method acting \(training yourself to speak a certain way until it becomes natural and instinctive\), but it's not method acting itself.

Point in fact, a lot of the greatest method actors are often the ones that don't seem to play anyone but themselves because the basic form of Stanislavski \(and where Adler and Strasberg diverged\) is to project *yourself* in the fictional situation of the scene until your reactions are no longer artificial choices but instinctive, gut reactions to how the actor would act given the same situation in real life. Marlon Brando, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have toyed with stunts from time to time but ultimately don't possess the chameleon\-like ability of other actors like DDL or Gary Oldman \- their mannerisms and expressions often stay largely the same because they're ultimately projecting themselves into a role, not magically transforming their own persona into that of someone fictitious.&&I read an interesting article...somewhere....about the research they did for the dialects and accents.  Most of it is a guess \- we don't have recordings of the accents from that time.  They ""reconstructed"" a lot of it from old newspapers and existing accents.&&[deleted]&&I don't think I've ever seen a religious zealot/shill portrayed so well. It's especially nice given how often Dano plays weenie/victim roles...I know he ends up being a pathetic mess at the end of There Will Be Blood, but the rest of the time he rides on bravado and false religiosity and it's hypnotic to watch.&&Thank you!! For the Paul Dano statement. Did you know Dano was hand pick by Lewis for There will be Blood based on his performance in The Ballad of Jack and Rose?&&Yeah. I love some things in Gangs of New York. The Butcher is amazing, and I love John C. Reilly, Brendan Gleeson, and the opening battle of the movie. I really don't care for Leo or Diaz much in the movie though, which brings it down a lot.&&Agreed&&> There will be blood was a much better movie. But for me, Bill the Butcher was a better character

I propose they remake the film, but ask DDL to play Bill the Butcher and change the storyline accordingly.

Now, if that happens, the title *There will be blood* starts making a lot more sense.&&I DRINK IT UP&&DRAAAAAAIIIINNAAAAGE!!!&&I ABANDONED MY BOOOOOYY!&&Sure, plenty good...but *Gangs of New York* good? I'm not gonna go that far.&&I don't know, I've seen people reference Bill the Butcher quite a lot, both online and in real life.

&&Every country does. America is just new enough to our Western screed of history that the skeletons still have a smell to them. Most regions in the world have forgotten histories of injustice as well: skeletons that have turned to dust and blown away.&&I am reading now. Great book. Didn’t realize bill was a Bowery boy at first &&Whoopsy daisy!&&Even ""evil"" characters can be swayed by their emotions. Bill respected the Priest a lot, and had grown to trust and value this boy. All of a sudden he realizes he's going to betray him and try to kill him. It would be perfectly natural to assume Bill would kill one of his underlings that betrays him, but he doesn't kill Amsterdam. Why? Emotions. Same with their final fight scene. You can tell he wasn't putting in his all to immediately kill the kid, even after everything that happened. I think maybe even then, at that party, Bill was hoping this kid would give him the death he was hoping for.&&To Bill, (and likely amsterdam), this was considered worse than death. There's honor in death, but none in being scarred and left to live your life knowing you're only alive because he LET you live. its like an ultimate insult/power assertion. made sense to me imo&&We didn't get to see the whole development of their relationship because it was kind of done in a montage but he loves him like a son at that point in the movie. He had no kids of his own and never planned to, Amsterdam was HIS chosen heir. He didn't kill him because he still thought of him like a son.&&Zefram Cochrane quote?&&I put it more down to casting than directly her acting which, yeah, is also pretty bad. She is completely the wrong actress for the film, but saying that I don't think there is many other actresses who could've made the role a worthwhile part of the film but it could definitely be better. 

It was such a waste of an opportunity to put something on film that probably won't get to be done again. Would've loved to see more of a biopic about Bill the Butcher and more of the people that there is real source material for. It would really make a good tv-series for the likes of HBO or Netflix. &&I honestly don't remember her in it&&So I’ve always wondered about the criticism of Irish accents in the movie, specifically Diaz’s. Realistically wouldn’t she have a sort of inbetween accent, since she was raised in America? People I know with Irish parents have accents that fall inbetween the local accent and their parents’ accents. Often it comes and goes and can sway one way or the other depending on who they’re talking to.&&Also for /u/alphaheeb and /u/rwburst50, it's a non-fiction book called ""The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld""  it was published in the 20's...

I didn't see it coming at all, anyway. I'm still shocked by Spacey&&He also had a tattoo of the band ISIS.&&I think There will be blood is a better movie overall, but I think the best character DDL has ever done is the butcher.&&Chewing the scenery? Hamming it up?&&You are thinking of bad overacting, not overacting. &&Not to be confused with Jack Slaw, a strapping young enthusiast of julienned cabbage with dressing. &&People tensing up?&&Leo decided to one-up him by fighting a real bear for his Oscar.&&It was one of the best scenes and showed the way of native American culture around the same time as dances with wolves who had the same native American actor.&&Yep. That’s probably it!&&Him in Prisoners was heartbreaking.&&Doesn’t surprise me. He was brilliant in that film. To hold your own in scenes with the greatest actor of all time is extremely difficult. Amazing performance. &&Leo is fine IMO, but Diaz's character adds nothing- and I mean *nothing*- to that movie.  In fact, if you completely removed all the scenes that just revolve around their romance, the movie trims down nicely and you lose nothing of significance.

Edit:  And I know it's such an easy thing to say:  ""ugh fuckin romantic subplots amirite?""  But really, the only thing that it adds is johnny's motivation to betray amsterdam.  That could be accomplished in a lot of ways, but instead you get a full 30 minutes of filler.

Think about the entire dance/dock scene.  There's fuckin *nothing* in that entire (15 minute?) block that moves the plot forward.  Same with the turtledove scene.  The romantic subplot in this movie is the definition of tacked-on, because not only does it accomplish nothing, but it bloats the movie to much longer than it needs to be.

RARR&&Exactly. Exactly. Also the final third of the film was kinda dull and strangely paced. &&Diaz is the weird part.&&Probably the movie I've seen most (easy background flick while I'm working or cleaning or something). Also standout performances by Jim Broadbent and Gary Lewis. I don't mind Leo at all in it - I was actually a big hater of his until Gangs & Catch Me If You Can helped me appreciate him and the projects he is involved with.
&&Besides Leo and Cameron the movie has this amazing authenticity about it. Would be interesting to see an alternate version where the two leads also talk funny like Bill and aren't Hollywood megastars.&&Thank christ she has retired, the scenes with Bill The Butcher were the only time the film came alive.&&BASTARD IN A BASKET!!!&&Have you seen the Pianist? It really was a stellar performance, and this is coming from a huge DDL fan. Now Gary Oldman stealing it this year, on the other hand...&&Brody was very good.  And in most years I'd be happy he won.  But DDL performance here is legendary.  I've said before, it is the greatest single performance I have ever seen in a film.

World building.&&Surely the key aspect of Diaz' character is her relationship with Bill and all that implies?&&She serves a point, she’s a love interest for both characters that serves to humanize them. Not romantic in the classic sense to Bill but he still feels betrayed in a similar way to Johnny showing that he does have feelings for her beyond sex or just friendship. 

You can’t have two people built and motivated on a single purpose. Bill couldn’t just be a ruthless Gang Leader who respects a fallen foe, she gives him depth. 

Leo couldn’t just be hell bent on revenge but struggling with his relationship with the man who killed his father. He had to have a life, something of his own to lose and to fight for. 

Granted they both disregarded her in the end but her character had been disregarded her whole life, as were both Bill and Amsterdam. Amsterdam by his father, Bill by the society and her by men. 

Maybe I’m reading too much into it, just really love this movie and I think some of the acting seems shitty just because DDL is just so fucking amazing. &&Holy shit, all these years I've never known that was Broadbent.&&Oldman's Oscar this year was one of those that was more a tribute to his entire body of work IMO. Wasn't his best performance. He has deserved one multiple times and not gotten it so they gave it to him this year when it was a toss up all around.

for example all the sharingan jutsu:amaterasu,tsukuyomi,izanami,izanagi,susanoo&&This is actually modeled after a real battle in Japanese history.

Exact same styling, couple hundred years prior. &&Most of the characters in Naruto are historical/mythological figures. Try looking it up, its actually an interesting read, also the similarities of myth and characters. I think amatarasu is also a myth thing, can't remember though.&&It's not just Naruto... a lot of the popular mangas (and by extension animes) have references or allusions to Eastern folklore and religions. It's just that since westerners aren't as familiar with those legends, they don't pick up on it. For example the first arc of Dragon Ball was basically a reimagining of  *Journey to the West*. Another commonly used trope are the 4 guardian deities (White Tiger, Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise) – lots of series  have characters that reference them (*Yuyu Hakusho*, *Digimon*, *Gurren Lagann*, *Ruroni Kenshin* just to name a few off the top of my head).&&All three of the legendary sanin are based on actual mythological figures. Actually, a lot of naruto is based on eastern mythology. &&Naruto is a treasure trove for references to things like that. All the Mangekyo Sharingan jutsu are all named after Japanese gods.&&It's pretty much like how western fantasy is pretty much just european mythology with a few changes&&Yeah I thought I was in /r/fakehistoryporn &&> real historical/mythological figure

&&Fun fact: Ninja Jiraiya was a japanese TV series in which the actor playing the master was actually the great Soke (master) of three ""Ninjitsu"" schools and the founder of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu, which is the main way people learn Ninjitsu outside of Japan nowadays.

One of the schools in the show, Togakure Ryu, is an actual Ninjitsu school of which he is the great master.&&tfw you summon gamatatsu instead of gamabunta

Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orichimaru were all characters from very popular kabuki plays, such as the Tale of Gallant Jiraiya.

This movie was adapted from the kabuki plays.&&I just wish they didn't spoil it by doing his backstory episode right before the big moment.

Doing a bit of research on this subject before I posted led me down a pretty interesting rabbit hole of Japanese mythology. Reddit's pretty cool sometimes. 

&&3rd hokage based off Chinese mythology I think. Monkey king. &&And it doesn't even stop there. Shukaku, Matatabi, Gyuki, and Kurama are all famous animal demons in Japanese mythology. 

Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami, Susanoo, etc. are also all famous Japanese mythological characters. &&> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiraiya

TIL&&Slug/frog magic sound so lame compared to snake magic. I'd feel so robbed if I had to fight a snake magician as a slug-girl.&&Was this an influence on the Toad guy in Kung Fu Hustle or was that inspired by wuxia novels?&&Thought you said slut magic. Disappointing. &&In brief, the names of most of those techniques are gods in the early Japanese creation myths. Amaterasu is the sun goddess, izanami and izanagi were responsible for the creation of the Japanese islands.&&There is also Kakashi's Chidori/Raikiri which is based on a story about a Samurai who cut a bolt of lightning in two with his sword ""Chidori"" and renamed it to ""Raikiri"" (Lightning Cutter).&&The entire ending.&&Got any links to read about this?&&I think a lot of a lot of anime and Japanese video games are. &&Or just really simply the whole 9 tailed fox thing.

I also liked how the Hokages staff had a whole journey to the west thing going on. &&Did he attack their weak point for massive damage?&&Not just Japanese, but Hindu and Buddhist mythos as well. Like Asura and Indra, or the Six Paths of Pain.

[Also this sick ass wood jutsu.](https://i.imgur.com/OIvf6gJ.mp4)&&I figured a lot of the creatures and abilities are probably loosely or not so loosely based on various parts of Japanese mythology, I just didn't expect main characters to be pulled directly from it. &&All of Pains forms or paths are representation of diffrent types of punishments after death in budhism. &&Tsukuyomi, Amaterasu, Inazagi and Izagami are all gods in Japanese.&&Basically everything.

For years when it was still publishing, the community would come up with theories how it would progress based on how the mythology.

Pretty much all the theories were wrong :D&&Orichimaru’s sword of kusanagi is also a reference from Japanese history.&&The tailed beasts are also creatures from japanese folklore&&Pretty much everything is Japanese mythology in there. &&Susanoo is a storm god in mythology who fought and killed the seven headed snake.

Amaterasu is also a goddess, Izanagi and Izanami are twins.

Kaguya is a also from a folk story.

And there is the nine tailed fox who is also found in japanese mythology. Most of the stuff in Naruto was picked from old tales as Kishimoto wanted the story to be about demons and magic but apparently he found it hard to draw Naruto's goggles so he changed it into a headband and the story about ninjas.&&Would it blow your mind to know Goku from Dragonball is also based on someone? He’s based on Sun Wukong from the Chinese story Journey to the West. 

At least before all the Saigon stuff. &&That was a great exhibit. I don’t remember that print though. I’ll have to look it up. &&Same. Obligatory for sure. &&Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia&&Kung Fu Hustle demonstrates that punting-while being initially effective-subsequently punishes the punter by opening them to devastating long-range hop slams. YMMV, though. &&No, that's Five Deadly Venoms unless I'm mistaken.&&No that sample is from a line in Five Deadly Venoms.&&Bad ass ninja, wise teacher, best selling author.

That is a man who had life figured out&&I always love thinking about how much these old special effects must've blown people's minds at the time.

How jaw dropping would A Trip to the Moon look in 1902, or Metropolis in 1927? How terrifying was Nosferatu in 1922, or King Kong in 1933? To eyes that had never seen anything like it, or maybe even eyes that had never even seen a motion picture before, it must have been hard to put into words.

It's really difficult to imagine how intense those experiences must have been, even with the reception of movies like Star Wars or The Matrix not that far off into the past.&&You bastard. I almost forgot about maes. Now im crying. &&Also [REMOVED FOR SPOILERS]&&Tbf the Waynes have appeared a couple times in recent years in the comics, alternate timelines and whatnot&&Ouch. Right in the feels. &&Asuma 😭&&They stay dead? Orochimaru says hello.&&You may want to finish Naruto before you say that..&&Wait what? Have you seen Naruto?&&For the biggest villain in DB they did not know if revival was even possible. DB is a different beast from the rest of the series and is better in almost every aspect.&&[deleted]&&It is definitely more comprehensible and entertaining. &&It didn’t make it any less sad though. If anything, it filled me with a sense of dreadful anticipation, and a faint hope that maybe they wouldn’t do it after all. &&Yeah, not everyone caught that. I was watching Naruto because I lost a bet with some kids I worked with. I wasn't expecting anything of substance from the show, so the backstory just felt like whatever. Then the Pain fight happened.

Last time I saw the opening for that season, I was showing it to my sister for the /r/anime opening contest and I had to walk out of the room because I couldn't hold it together. That episode caught me completely off guard.&&I didn't find it that obvious. After all Kakashi got the same treatment a handful of episodes before and he was alright.
Tsunami crying while watching him walk away was a bit of a giveaway though&&I watched that when I was 15. I cried &&Honestly I liked how they did that, even before you could tell Jiraya would be one of the characters to go, and when he finally chose to go on the mission, it really felt like he knew he was wrapping up his entire life, start to finish.&&I knew it was going to happen as soon as I saw the intro for that season. Anime intros are the worst spoilers.&&Yeah I hated that the anime changed that.&&Luckily I was reading it as it came out in the manga, no spoilers for me.&&That’s why I had to watch the kai version that sequences it like the manga (flashbacks were all mixed in with the fight instead of being separate)&&""Chosen One!""
""I am coming!""
Repeat x100&&Ehhhh EHHHHHH!&&I loved the animation they did. It gave it such a sense of scale for how fast they were moving. I'd definitely rather there be some blurring and longer shots of hand-drawn than the cgi they started using later for battles. &&Team 7 vs Zabuza/haku for me&&My theory is that hes a character that's currently in the manga but not in the anime yet. Google kashin koji. Litterally looks like jiraiya with a mask.&&There are tons of good sequences through out the show after jiraiya. It's just got bad pacing. But honestly has a satisfying ending compared to many animes. 

Edit: 

The arrival of Madara, for reals, is fucking intense.

Slimes up his mouth while he's at it. The slug however just grins sluggishly&&From the wikipedia article:

> Although this game was imported from China, the Japanese version differs in the animals represented. In adopting the game, the original Chinese characters for the poisonous centipede (蜈蜙) were apparently confused with the characters for the ""slug"" (蛞蝓). The centipede was chosen because of the Chinese belief that the centipede was capable of killing a snake by climbing and entering its head.

In Japanese lore, they thought that a slug could dissolve a snake with its outer layer of mucus and would also be immune to its poison. 

It's mostly false, but the slimy outer layer of some slugs do make them difficult to eat by snakes. [For example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_95hJ2mHgQ).
&&To be fair how does a piece of paper beat a rock?&&It's goey and shit &&About the same way a paper beat rocks.&&Alien eye magic beat Snake too, then knocked up Slug.&&well it wasn't a fight, he got slugged for peeping on her in the bathroom, just like full on super strength punched.

I don't know how closer it needs to be to the source to be considered 'fully' rather than 'partly'.

&&Not quite based off of the monkey king though, Sarutobi Sasuke is the name of a (thought to be) fictional character in Japanese mythology, credited with being the leader of Sanada's 10 braves/heroes, which in turn are credited with having a major role in the Siege of Osaka.

While both are based on a monkey, Sun wukong/son goku is a monster/spirit who takes the form of a monkey whereas with Sarutobi Sasuke, his name is more of a title than a name (it wasn't his given name at birth) meaning flying monkey, which references his speed and agility on the battlefield, reminiscent of a monkey, not actually a monkey himself.

Sarutobi's summon is a bit of a different story though, the elongating staff is a pretty clear nod to Sun Wukong. &&Isn't it the Epic of Gilgamesh?

The clip is from Storm 4 I believe.&&I am not really too knowledgeable about the topic as I‘ve only seen it in a video myself.

Those are 2 heavenly domains (deva and asura) which are the chinbaku tensei and the cyborg body. Then 2 hellish domains (preta and naraka) which are absorption of ninjutsu and the ghost statue. And then the animal and human path somewhere inbetween with summoning jutsu and soul absorbing one. I‘d recommend reading up on the desire realm in budhism if you are interested. Those powers itself are inspired by what each of these domains within the desire realm contain. &&My buddy still brings up that he called this immediately after tobi was introduced.&&Not to rain on your parade but until Tobi claimed to be Madara pretty much everyone and their mother thought it would be Obito.

We can argue endlessly about ""what could/should/would have happened.""

I didn't even think about how towards the end of Shibbuden they basically took a shit on Sakura as a character, despite setting her up to be such a badass who was grown and independent at the beginning of it. 

Hated what they did with Sasuke too, and that he ended up with Sakura because she deserves so much better than a literal murderer like him. I know he and Naruto are ""friends"", but he should be locked up. He was so delusional at that point with his rant about wanting to be Hokage...

The other teams thing is something I have been aware of though, as a lot of the early games and my interest in the manga was all the different powers, abilities, and interactions they had during the Chuunin exams. There was so much potential character development for characters like the dynamics of the Hyuuga clan \(which should have played a much bigger role in the series considering they were also direct descendants of Kaguya\), Gaara and the Sand, or even the Ino/Shika/Cho team with their unique synergy.

I'm a bit conflicted though with your point about Naruto's ideologies with destiny. I know he's always said it himself and it really came through in his fight with Neji during the Chuunin exams. He also came from nothing with no family and with no special talent \(he barely made Genin and failed his initial exams\) yet worked hard. But at the same time he was lucky enough to get that Shadow Clone Jutsu scroll and he's always had the Nine Tales host thing going, so he's always been the special ""chosen one"". He's a textbook example of a  typical shonen anime main character.&&Definitely some good points. I hate Sakura's arc as a character; among other things you mentioned. 

There's hundreds of factors that go into this show being the way it is: for one, the fact that anime is made from a business stand point; to sell merchandise. 

I'm not arguing that you don't have a right to be mad for how it ended. 

But also consider that, for the medium through which this story is told, it's not *that* bad. 

There are soooo many animes that ended more terribly than Naruto. And that are told more terribly.

I understand the feeling of being invested in a story and having these expectations that ultimately come up short.  There was a lot of potential that you feel was squandered. But it is what it is, can't really change that, so trying to find the good aspects of it might prove beneficial to your outlook on the show; giving a more balanced perspective.&&Glorious.&&I too love Guy and am a big fan. Probably my most controversial Naruto opinion though is that I absolutely HATE Rock Lee with a passion. He's just such an annoying character that doesn't really add anything to the cast of characters beyond being a joke with how much he loves Sakura, and his philosphies are all just kind of taken from Guy. He just happens to be from the current generation.&&Haha :D

I wish!&&Don't be afraid to skip filler episodes. The overall premise of the show can be conveyed/grasped without half the episodes honestly. &&And to think that most of the fight is just Shikamaru trying to catch Temari with his jutsu&&[It was part of an Arrangment album called Grand Finale.](https://youtu.be/RW3WDPTOJ9w)&&That is exactly correct&&A boy can dream &&I have no mouth, and I must scream&&For some reason this imagery just killed me, thank you.&&Kakashi vs Obito in shippuuden e375 is one of my favourites. Short but good. Also Sasuke fighting Kinshiki in Boruto is probably my favourite fight in the franchise 
 &&I'll admit I've never watched shippouden only read it so I cant comment on that anime. But I'll agree with that Leevgara statement, watching the chunin exams as a kids blew my mind!&&I’m here for Rock Lee babey&&Rip to people who wanted to watch that for TenTen&&I've always thought it was that Naruto has such a huge amount of Chakra that it was extremely difficult for a novice to control. While other kids were told to fill a cup from a pitcher, he had a fire hose.

It's also why mass shadow clones were easy for him. It's forbidden since you effectively divide up your chakra between clones, so if you don't have much you risk potentially killing yourself. For him, it worked like a hose splitter making it easier for him to control his chakra.&&> But he came from an equally powerful clan, and a prodigously talented father

Yea they really sent mixed messages with Naruto. At first(despite his father being obvious) they kind of pushed a message of ""hard work can overcome a elite bloodline."" Then it was like, just kidding both of his parents were amazing and he was a chosen one from the get go.

That's sort of a reoccurring issue in anime, though. Goku was able to overcome the elite Prince Vegeta through hard work, but then Vegeta took the hard work to the next level, but Goku remained superior because... because he's Goku I guess.&&naruto had tons of motivation:  he said since like day 1 he wanted to be hokage.  he didn't have role models, guidance, or positive reinforcement until iruka though.&&Superman appeared in published print in ‘38.

Edit: jk found it on YouTube. Dope fight but it's been so long since I watched anything Naruto I wasn't super drawn in, I'll just have to watch more and see how it stacks up&&I actually really liked the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Sure it felt kinda shoehorned in because it *had* to happen regardless of who was the main villain, but it was pretty well animated and choreographed.&&Is Boruto any good? I haven't gotten around to watching it but the name cracks me up.&&You endured all of Shippuden for a Rock Lee moment...didn't you? :\(&&Demon chakra? Don't need it. Kekkei genkai? Nah fam. Alien eyeball powers? Fuck 'em. Rock Lee is just fuckin *good,* baybeee!&&I see you misspelled Choji.&&There were a couple of factors. But it is pretty clear by the begining of Shippuden that Naruto simply wasn't putting his best foot forward to start. According to Word of God, Naruto has the second most chakra of any human, behind only Kisame. So yes, he had lots of chakra to burn, and that is the only reason he was able to perform any jutsu at all before the series begins in earnest and he gets his clones. Combined with the fact that the Uzumaki clan has incredibly, super strong chakra, they get more oomph for the same amount, a lot more. This wasn't conveyed very well in the dub, they bring it up but it's a bit ambiguous. 

But the real evidence that he was simply not trying, not *really*, is in two parts. The first is, his theory instantly improves to match or even beat Sakura's whenever they are in any actual danger. This is explicitly stated by any and all of his classmates whenever they first see him really kick it into gear. The second, is he is **by far** the fastest to ever learn the technique Jiraiya suspects is the most difficult to master, and the only to make it even more complex. 

There is a bit more. The seal did have a small effect on his chakra control. It was modified to be less effective than previous versions. But instead of holding the fox back all on it's own, it also drew upon a small reserve from Naruto's own chakra to shore up the barrier. This was done so that when he has more control, he could effectively use it as a tap to siphon off the fox's juice, instead of having a solid wall blocking them off. But it caused a bit of ""turbulence"" where their chakra mixed, which had a small but noticeable effect. Orochimaru exploited this by further modifying the seal in order to drastically increase the instability of the mix, which artificially held him back in the forest and prelim round, it was basically his enormous and strong chakra that allowed him to use any jutsu at all during that time. But without Orochimaru's modification, it was a small disruption, that we saw him easily overcome when he put his mind to it.&&Sorry to nit pick, but its forbidden because its the only clone technique that passes its memory onto the caster.  Naruto is just really the only one with enough chakra to make more than a handful.&&It is pretty clearly framed that it was a kind of false drive though. A noble goal, but one he wasn't really working towards, or he would have been training instead of practicing his artwork. It wasn't really his drive to **become Hokage** that drove him, it was his drive to protect the village. He had one desire before and after getting up off his ass, but he didn't really start working on it until he got the second. I'm not saying he didn't still strongly want to be Hokage, but it pretty clearly wasn't the real driving force behind the character.&&My b my b&&I care about Kiba. No one gives a shit about Tenten&&How about Yamsha&&yeah? the prequel guy. explains how boruto's dad became hokage. it has a ton of little references, like how shino decided to become a teacher or how chocho's parents met&&Now I know I'm getting old&&Yeah he's kind of just a discount Guy. Iknow it was his thing in the first half of Naruto to have the same clothing and that Guy took pity on him and helped him, but after that his character never really changed or evolved. Guy we didnt' need to see change because he's already a mature adult who developed his ideology after tons of obstacles, Lee just copied it and didn't add anything.&&I actually really like Boruto, but I'm a fanboy so take that for what it's worth. 

Ep 54, around the 5 min mark: http://www3.borutoget.info/boruto-episode-54-english-subbed-w/
&&Hmm well, it's a lot like the original naruto but in the style of shippuden.

You've got a core trio of Boruto (Naruto and Hinata's son), Sarada (Sasuke and Sakura's daughter), and Mitsuki (Orochimaru's son) and a couple secondary trios with Shikamaru's/Lee's/Gaara's kid etc. 

They're all genin doing their first missions and stuff, currently the series is going through its ""Chunin Exams"" arc, it's basically a mirrored plot. 

Overall the secondary characters are less interesting IMO (the core trio are cool), but the shows makes up for that because we also have all of the characters from Shippuden like Naruto, Sasuke, Shikamaru, Lee, etc. Also there have been some *really* good (albeit short) fight choreographies, so there's a lot of potential there.

Also no filler yet :)

'Sesame Street' sues makers of Melissa McCarthy puppet movie 'The Happytime Murders',28530,8mb49k,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/05/26/sesame-street-sues-makers-melissa-mccarthy-puppet-movie/647225002/,1355,1527350889.0,,"To clarify anyone who just read the title, it's nothing terribly serious. 

The company found issue with the ""No Sesame, all street"" line used in the trailer, as they believe it could make people think it's done by/related to them. Considering they're a family friendly program without silly string jizz, it makes sense, and they just want to distance themselves more than anything from Happy Time Murders.

The crew on the movie doesn't take issue with that at all (the whole incident just gives them even more free marketing) and said they'd be more than willing to work with Sesame Street's company&&This reminds me of the Smile Time episode of Angel&&I can't get ""smile time"" (Angel episode) out of my head when I see the trailers...

""I'm gonna rip you a new puppet hole bitch!""&&I have no problem with a R-rated Muppet movie, but by God was that trailer terrible. 

Literally ALL the humour was of the “haha did that muppet seriously just say/do that” brand?!

Not an ounce of wit anywhere.

Learn from Roger Rabbit! &&I guess I’m a little confused. Isn’t this movie directed by Brian Henson?&&I'm just shocked this thing is being released. Humor is subjective so I get most people (at least the audiences I've seen it in the cinema with) found it amusing, but I honestly thought this was a Tropic Thunder style fake trailer. &&I kind of saw this coming...&&They made a boo boo when the quoted the trailer as “Less Sesame, More Street”

I somehow think corporate legal already anticipated all of this legal stuff &&I just read the plot summary for this movie and I'm a bit confused.  It sounds an awful lot like Who Framed Roger Rabbit.&&A lot of people in this thread must have never had the joy of seeing Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"".&&ITT:

People who think that the Sesame Street company and the Muppet company, Jim Henson Company, are the same thing &&Uh, they prefer to be called Fabricated Americans. &&Why this and not Avenue Q?&&This movie looks terrible, and the controversy seems fake to generate publicity about a movie that they don't want to invest too much into promoting. &&Looks like someone in Hollywood finally saw Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles.&&This movie looks beyond bad. &&Just watch “Meet the Feebles” instead. &&I remember when this was called ""the fuzz""&&I know this isn't about the article itself, but I have to say it. This movie looks bad. I thought the idea sounded really funny if they actually did smart humor, like who framed Roger rabbit. But it looks like a susage party approach just make dick jokes.&&Melissa McCarthy looks like a muppet in that picture&&TIL that Jim Henson's son directed this.  &&I once thought about masturbating with a sock puppet and got a cease and desist order in the mail the next day. What a pain it was to have to copyright my own damn puppet for this shit. &&Movie looks like shit.  The trailer and poster both have the tag line “No Seseme.  All Street.” The trailer opens like a kids movie and makes a big deal to point out it’s the same director of multiple MUPPET movies before showing a muppet asking to suck a dick - so yeah it makes sense they are getting sued. 

They probably expected this, though.  It’s marketing. &&Can someone tell me why people hate Melissa McCarthy so much? && The director did Muppet Christmas Carol? ...I may have actual hope for this film now lol &&Sesame Street takes their image VERY seriously.  Avenue Q only happened because the creators had *worked* on Sesame Street and knew exactly how to keep themselves in the clear, and they still weren’t entirely sure Sesame Street would allow it.&&They didn't have a problem when The State was eating Muppet for dinner.&&Sounds like parody to me.&&The original pitch for happytime murders sounded so much better. I'm really disappointed they didn't follow it and make it on Netflix played more straight.&&This movie looks terrible. It looks like it will lack the nuance of Team America.&&If they hadn’t used the tag line, “no sesame, all street” they probably would have been in the clear. By using the tag line they’ve conflated the two properties and will probably have to pay a good chuck of their profits to Sesame Street. &&Avenue Q did it first. Just saying.&&I saw this coming a mile away when i heard the no sesame street quip&&I'm one who enjoys his fair share of low brow humor, and I'd heard talks of The Happytime Murders for years.  Never thought much of it, nor did I think it was ever going to happen.  I chuckled a few moments during the trailer, but overall I thought it looked kinda stupid.  Reminded me a lot of Team America meets Roger  Rabbit, but not in a good way.&&My only question is when the Jason Siegle cameo is &&This was posted yesterday, no?&&So the Cookie Monster has ran out of cookies huh&&I just hope this movie brings more attention to a little Peter Jackson gem titled *Meet the Feebles*, another movie filled with violence, sex and an all Muppet cast &&Wait but I thought the Jim Henson Group owns both...?&&Now they can market themselves as ""the movie so raw it was sued by sesame street""&&BIG BIRD IS PISSED&&Everyone's a little bit racist.&&What I hate most about this movie is that it’s going to make an Avenue Q movie nearly impossible to make now. &&I feel like since it's Bryan Henson directing they could have just asked him to remove it casually instead of an actual minor lawsuit. &&I guess this is interesting, in that it's making me consider things I wouldn't have otherwise. We see references to someone's past work in marketing material all the time.

>""From the [writer/director/producer/creator/whatever] that brought you _Some Thing You Might Have Actually Liked_...""

I never really paid it much mind, let alone consider it from a branding/copyright infringement perspective.

Despite it being obvious to all of us who he is, just for the sake of conversation: if George Lucas decided he wanted to get back into directing sci-fi, is he allowed to state such a fact, ""From the creator of Star Wars"", or would that make him subject to a lawsuit from Disney? Independently, if the tagline for his new movie was something like ""Less stars, more wars"" is that actionable?

Maybe Leonard French will do a video on it so I can pretend I understand.&&Was wondering how that slogan got approved...
&&Anyone watch Meet the Feebles? Seems in the same vein&&I was wondering how they got away with all sesame no street, turns out they didnt.&&This movie is nothing new in terms of shocking funny stuff with puppets, there was a great film back in 80’s called Meet The Feebles that was really fucked up and a direct parody of the muppet show.  It had sex, violence and drugs and was directed by Peter Jackson.&&doesnt fair use laws protect parodies?&&I feel like I've been hearing about this movie being in production for at least 10 years, easily. Hope it's awesome.&&Thought it was a muppet movie, oh well still won't see it&&This movie looks really dumb&&This looks like a version of Puppet Rapist with no rapes.&&This is a headline I've been expecting for years&&Even with the publicity this gives the movie I'm still not watching it. At the very least not paying my money to watch it. I don't care for Melissa McCarthy as a comedian and if I wanted to watch a movie with puppets I'll watch the Muppets or dark Crystal&&Satire is protected speech.&&r/bertstrips&&This was funnier when it was called meet the feebles&&“The Happytime Murders” is a meet between Peter Jackson’s “Meet the Feebles” and “Who Frames Roger Rabbit?”  &&whelp, another fine example of Melissa McCarthy's vacuous style, terrible sense of humor, underwhelming air of smugness, crass, straight outta locash, tacky, lazy output.

Go Away.&&have you noticed that first they did Ghostbusters, then she directly ripped off Back to School, now she's ripping off Meet the Feebles?

this hackfraud is just working her way through the 80's.&&Pretty sure this would be filed under parody in Fair Use. Nice try, Elmo.&&Good that movie looks like absolute garbage. Hahaha gross out humor and sex jokes are soooo funny guys/s&&How about suing McCarthy herself for being a terrible actress?&&Is this considered a parody? Is it legally safe then?&&This thread is pretty disgusting and terrible over an actress.  This isn't why I follow this sub.  You don't like her? Fine.  But name calling is for 6 year olds.  &&It's weird because Henson Alternative, part of The Jim Henson Company, is doing the puppets for the film. The Jim Henson Company also created the characters for Sesame Street, so there *is* an association, whether Sesame Street wants to admit it or not.&&I saw that tag line in the trailer and was wondering why Sesame Street would allow it...I guess they were wondering the same thing&&Isn't this just a rip off of [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3123004/) ?&&Isn't modern society depressing enough without the movies having to replicate all the situations to make even fiction depressing as hell?  Its like everyone has to be reminded ""Hey, I know this movie is fiction and an escapist fantasy but we still have to remind you of how shitty society is.""&&I've spoken to folks who are calling this film""innovative"", not realising Peter Jackson already did this style of film years ago.&&I personally am super excited for this movie. Hope it does well&&I want to see this movie.&&Wow this movie just looks cringey and dumb. &&They should also sue her for making that ""Tammy"" movie.&&This is a joint PR stunt between Sesame Street and The Happytime Murders.

Sesame Street creators really love this thing but can't use their show to promote it, nor can THM use any sort of Sesame Street related allusions in their promo material. And they know this.

So, what do they go and do? Create a piece of promo material that specifically references Sesame Street when they know full well they can't. So naturally, Sesame Street has to respond. They do so with a creatively positioned lawsuit which they planned to dismiss from the beginning so that THM can say ""Oh our bad, sorry. We'll change it if you drop the suit."" and benefit from the huge media storm over absolutely nothing with clickbait bullshit titles like this one and it costs them nothing at all.&&Is it because they put Melissa McCarthy in it and ruined what could've been a funny movie? &&The red band trailer for the happytime murders played during the showing of Deadpool 2 and the theater went fucking crazy with laugher, this movie is totally going to be successful. Anyone else have the same experience? It was nuts. &&Meh, all I can hope for is that the movie fails spectacularly and McCarthy can fuck right back off to whatever pit she crawled out from &&who framed roger puppet?&&Wait, so is this not related to the muppets? I thought it had the same director, the way the trailer was set up made it seem like they had approval...I’m still confused&&Why did they sue them. Now this crappy movie is going to get (slightly) more publicity.&&This movie looks really stupid.&&It's parody, that won't fly in court.&&This will be received as one of the worst movies of the year. Guaranteed at least 1 razzie nom.&&This movie looks horrible &&Yeah this was an obligatory lawsuit out of PR rather than anything too detrimental I think. The filmmakers have to admit that they were asking for it though. There's tons of ways to do puppet-like characters but mimicking ones off of a well-established brand AND more importanly using their name as part of your ""clever"" tagline for marketing is 100% ruffling feathers.&&When I saw that tagline, I assumed Sesame Street had signed off on it and I had no idea why they were doing that to their brand.

Edit: And now that they've filed the lawsuit, that clears it up. I think their filing of it was more important than whatever the result ends up being. &&This seems like a good moment to reminisce about an old friend who [received a cease & desist from the Henson Company](https://boingboing.net/2016/11/14/why-disney-owns-muppetfucker-n.html) for using the DJ name 'Muppetfucker'. It brings me no small amount of joy to know somebody at Disney had to buy the domain name muppetfucker.net.&&When I saw the trailer, I heard a woman in the audience say ""that's a muppet movie?"". I think there's gonna be a lot of confused parents and crying kids.&&I have to be honest I saw that line and thought it was likely there was some kind of licensing with sesame street.&&That makes sense.  Otherwise, I was gonna say... if they can sue over this movie, they could have sued over Meet the Feebles for sure.  If you want a fucked up puppet movie, that's your flick.&&If you watch the trailer, it's more than the tag line. ""After 35 years of entertaining. . ."" They imply these are the Muppets of Sesame Street.&&Maybe I am getting dumber as I get older, but I did think it was authorized by Seasame Street based off that tag line.  I thought it was neat that they'd be able to be tongue in cheek, but I get why they have a problem with it.&&This is confusing since the director himself is the son of the late creator of Sesame Street himself. He also made the past movies. Why sue him if the director/son himself said this isn't affiliated of Sesame Street in any way except the tagline, just him wanting to have fun?&&I would think these guys would have a better case 

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3123004/&&the article I read yesterday said that Sesame Street asked them to remove the tagline and the company told them no, hence having to take a legal path&&Lol wait. It’s not made by Sesame Street ? 

That line actually did make me think it was the same guys. &&Makes perfect sense. Seeing them put all those muppet credits at the start added to the confusion.&&“Considering they’re a family friendly program without silly string jizz....”

Lmfao. Done. &&I legit thought it was from people who made Sesame Street &&I’m one of the ones who thought they were related to it somehow but I’ve only seen the trailer once. &&Yeah, I saw that line. I figured that'd be part of it, but didn't realize that was basically it.&&Won't lie. I thought it was the Sesame Street people.&&/r/savedyouaclick&&I like you.&&I actually had to check, after seeing that line in the trailer, that this wasn’t connected in some way to Sesame Street.

So, yeah.  They might have a point.&&There’s no obvious confusion, so no potential damage, but you must fight to protect your trademarks or you risk their value being eroded.&&I could see that. I honestly thought it was a Sesame Street movie until I saw this post. I was very confused by the decision, but it didn’t stop me from believing. &&The tagline is said right next to saying the director worked on several muppet movies.. yeah I don't blame them. Super misleading.&&Gold him &&You are the real MVP&&One of my friends actually thought this movie was affiliated with Sesame Street because of this line, and nothing I said could change his mind. So, this definitely seems fair to me.&&I wanna put you in a magic genie lamp and just summon you to comment threads that need a smart logical voice.&&The upcoming movie reminds me of that line from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde:

""...because I'm under my desk."" &&Oh man I love that episode&&“Is there a Geppetto in the house?” -Lorne&&I do not have Puppet Cancer!&&Holy crap the nostalgia 😀&&I fucking forgot they did a puppet episode!&&THANK YOU! I knew it reminded me of something, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

That was one of my all time favorite episodes of Angel by a long shot!&&*Self esteem is for everybody*&&As a kid (super young like 5-7) I would watch Buffy at my aunt's house. My strongest memory of that is the puppet episode. I don't even remember the plot. Just the fact their was puppets.&&Shortly after this episode I attend an SF convention. An older woman had a hand-made Angel muppet with her, quite aligned up with how it was in the episode. No, it was not purchased it was hand-made; I asked.&&Just watched Angel for the first time (in preparation for an Angel podcast called Angel on Top, a sister pod to Buffering the Vampire Slayer) and this was one of my favorite episodes. That show is... a lot.&&I'm just wondering if Greg the Bunny will make an appearance.&&Unrelated but happy cake day!&&Nah. They are following the Sausage Party school of filmography.&&The Jim Henson Company has a live show called ""Puppet Up! Uncensored.""  It's an improv puppet show, where they do skits based on audience suggestions, using Muppets.  Not the classic characters, because those are owned by Disney.  They had to come up with a new cast of characters.  And they go very blue.  Lots of swearing and sex jokes.  Definitely not for kids.  And it's hilarious.  They're so good at what they do, and the performers are really clever and funny.  I recommend this show to everyone.  So when I first heard about ""The Happytime Murders,"" I was excited, because the concept can work.  If done right, it could be awesome.  But boy, that trailer was awful.  Nothing funny in it at all.  I cringed through the whole thing at its stupidity.  Which makes me sad, because after it bombs, no one will ever try this concept again.  Plus, any hope of an ""Avenue Q"" movie will go down the drain with it.&&From the ""did *that* just happen?"" school of lame ass banter comedy.&&Well there goes my hopes for an Avenue Q movie.&&DUDE. PENIS. LMAO.

Yeah, I was interested, but it lost me. It's just easy jokes.&&Don't watch ""meet the feebles"".   Peter Jackson makes a B style Muppet show movie that probably exists in the same universe but has nothing to do with them.   It has a probably a top five puke scene in it comparable to Team America and Meaning of Life.  I consider the puke scene in question better in terms of quality.&&They used the same Melissa McCarthy is a man joke twice in the trailer. Really makes you think about how little punchlines they have in the movie worth advertising 🤔&&Yeah I don’t have high hopes for this film, which is too bad because the concept is awesome &&And you just know they put the funniest parts in the trailer.

I pity anyone who spends money on it&&If you want R-rated Muppets, then ""Meet the Feebles"" is for you. An early Peter Jackson film.&&Reminds me of that Whoopie Goldberg dinosaur movie.&&Haha lol the puppet say sex thing haha i like sex haha sex funny haha very good&&Roger Rabbit is a masterpiece that I have added to my 10 favourite movies.

Watching it is a young kid is absolutely magical.

Watching it as a kid is great.

Watching it as a young adult you catch the dirtiest jokes.

Watching it as an adult you catch the serious tone and the drama.

and that is just the story.

If you analyse the acting, the animation, the techniques used, how revolutionary it was for its time and how timeless it is, how it still stands out as a great movie...

God damn.

If there are 100 movies that deserve a 10/100 rating, Roger Rabbit is one of them.
&&To be fair, in the right hands the ""puppet doing a thing"" humor can work amazingly well. Matt Stone and Trey Parker understood that and really took great advantage of it. The sex scene in Team America (original cut at least) wouldn't have been remotely funny if it were regular people. Buuuut, because they were marionettes it turned into one of the absolute funniest scenes in cinema history. I can't recall a time where I laughed harder than that. &&The first 30 seconds or so we're good. Boy did it shit the bed at the end. Judging from the reaction of my theater, it will make bank though &&Melissa mccarthy sooo....&&Exactly this. My friends, girlfriend and I all loved the 2010 muppets because it didnt go overboard and was subtle. Happy time murders does not, and while i'll still see it, I'm concerned it will be way too goofy and no smart humor&&It's just about the tagline ""No Sesame.  All Street"".  They just want that removed, not to stop the release altogether.&&Yes, but it's about the Sesame Street trademark, which isn't owned by The Jim Henson Company. It's about the tagline they used, not the puppets.&&The Jim Henson company has been a mess since Disney bought the Muppets.&&It's basically Sausage Party humor with Muppets, from what I'm seeing. Personally, I'll give it a chance, as I found Sausage Party quite entertaining, but I can certainly see this not being for everyone.&&They might've done it on purpose hoping to get sued so that they could get some buzz/free advertisement for the movie.

It's paid off cause I've seen this article about 84 times since yesterday.&&To be fair, it was all over the walls and office windows, so it's hard to miss it &&I didn't. I assumed that tagline was okayed before they ever used it.&&It’s basically exactly Roger Rabbit. That’s what I thought of when I saw the trailer in the theater except it doesn’t really seem like there is a pure slapstick Roger Rabbit role, but McCarthy and the other detective split the humor. &&Or read the article, either. &&Or Greg the Bunny&&Now, *that* was a crass movie. This looks tame in comparison.

If you don't believe me, go treat yourself. Bring a bucket.&&Yes, I just made a big comment about that, I ha e never known anyone else to have seen that.   I used to have it on VHS as a teen and it was one of my greatest cult treasures of fucked up film.  I showed it to so many people.&&Meet the Feebles is a film cult classic, it's basically unknown but some say it's fantastic.&&Avenue Q is a truly hidden treasure. I’d love to see that on the big screen, full musical style. &&Read the article, my dude.&&Because avenue Q was parody, and avoided using copyrighted language or oblique trademarks.  They took some trouble to ensure people knew it was not authorized.

This is being asked to remove a tagline that literaly uses a trademarked word.  It's not like they are trying to shut down the movie, just removing the use of trademark.

In other words... RTFA?&&They did invest into promoting it. Just a different approach with how they did it. Pay for an article to go out criticizing it’s connection to Sesame Street, get the article to the right people. Have money set aside for small lawsuit that would probably be settled out of court, then pay for another article about the lawsuit to stir controversy. 

This is a common practice in film that dates back from the beginning of film.

[Laemmle planted a newspaper story in February 1910 that the “Biograph Girl” had been struck and killed by a streetcar, and then took out an advertisement in an industry newspaper to debunk the story. “We Nail a Lie” declared the IMP advertisement, which blamed rival studios for the deception of its own creation and announced that not only was Lawrence alive, but that she would star in its next film.](https://www.history.com/news/florence-lawrence-the-first-movie-star)&&I thought the same thing.  No way mainstream could hold a candle to that awesome depravity though.&&167% with you.  Sad that this is what comedic films are now.  It’s always a romantic comedy, something rehashed for nostalgia, or a product of nothing but obscenity.  And look, I’m not some choir singing evangelical.  I’m down with taking it to and over the edge.  But there needs to be more than an ejaculating puppet.  &&[deleted]&&I dislike the roles she takes. Someone above talked about her being the female Kevin James, and I find that accurate, as a lot of her jokes boil down to physical humor at the expense of an overweight person. Yeah, it's her right to make fun of it, it doesn't make it any funnier to me. I think she could do better given the chance, but she doesn't seem to care enough to stretch out beyond these roles. I think the one movie I saw her in that I enjoyed was that movie Spy, and I don't know if that was enjoyable because of her, or in spite of her, because the writing I actually found to be enjoyable.&&I just find her humor annoying and not funny&&She doesn't know how to act any way other than herself.

Or at least I haven't seen a movie of hers where she plays a *vastly* different character than anything else she's been in.

Vince Vaughn, Nick Cage, Owen Wilson, Jennifer Lawrence, to name a few, are like that as well. 

She needs to break out of her comedian box and do something off-the-wall like a remake of *Misery*.&&Well, theres a lot of anecdotal reasons as to why everyone has their particular distaste for her, so I'm going to try and stay as non-biased as possible. 

Her first appearances on film and television garnered her a lot of hype and media attention, especially since she began starring in popular programs such as Gilmore Girls and Mike & Molly, due to her unique personality and upbringing when compared to other prolific female actors. However, that same personality carries into all of her roles, and over time her style became more recognized and it grew bland. Evident in comparisons between her roles in movies such as The Heat, Identity Thief, and Spy; McCarthy hasnt been able to develop a different style or personality on set despite the difference in roles she plays, leaving a lot of audiences feeling disappointed for essentially watching what felt like a sequel to the last movie they saw with her in it despite them having no relation whatsoever. 

With that being said, shes the second-highest paid female actor in America as of 2016, with a net worth of $33 million. Shes won two primetime Emmy awards, and has been nominated for dozens of other awards for various reasons. Whether or not her style is beginning to stale for some doesn't change the fact that millions of others still enjoy what she puts out, and that's okay.  &&Clunky actress that throws up endless generic mom jokes that barely even get an internal chuckle, rinse and repeat every movie she's been in and you get a large portion of people that find her extremely annoying. Has nothing to do with her being a woman? What the fuck kind of argument even is that? &&“I really wish I knew how to tie my shoes!”&&You are right, but that's a sentence I NEVER expected to read. &&I'm going with Meet the Feebles 1989&&Did it better too judging by the trailer&&No one has a patent on adult puppets. Can you imagine if Muppets was shot down because sesame Street did it first? This movie is going to be awful for a lot of other reasons, let's focus on those.&&Meet the Feebles has them beat by like 2 decades.&&I think he is still credited as creator.  Most IP transactions provide for enduring creator credits which means you can say you are/be described as such anytime, anywhere.  &&Sadly yes. And I thought the same. Also reminded me of the old Greg the Bunny bumps.&&both by jim henson!&&Yeah let's not forget her great acting of shitting in a sink that got her an Oscar nomination. &&Comedy is completely subjective. That’s why there are different kinds of comedy for different people. I happen to think she’s fuckin hilarious. And given her success, I’d say other people do too.

You go away.&&She's just awful, I'd stand up in court & testify to that. &&Class action?&&Well, this lawsuit is just in regards to the film's tagline, ""no sesame, all street."" But as far as the like design of the puppets themselves, I'm not sure. The movie is made by Brian Henson, Jim's son, and he kind of pioneered the look. I'd imagine that they'd never have made this film is it wasn't ok to do so. They're not using any trademarked characters in the movie, just generic Muppets. &&For real, everyone is entitled to their opinion but it’s arrogant to state it as an indisputable fact, without even mentioning the anger and rudeness&&People are “showing you the door” and telling you to leave??
...this subreddit is not intended for what they are defending. 

At this point you might as well shit on the floor in someone else’s living room and say “if you don’t like it, then leave” because that is what this is reduced to. &&""Meet The Feebles"" -- I saw all of Jackson's early films. Couldn't believe it when they gave him the LOTR franchise... but I was very happy that they did because I knew come what may it wouldn't be Just Another Hollywood Fantasy.

""Meet The Feebles"" -- I love that film. I still use it to freak out visitors from time to time.&&Maybe that's why, to get their train out in front to make sure people know they have no part of this.&&They're not mimicking anything.  All of the puppets in ""The Happytime Murders"" were made by the Jim Henson Company, the same company who makes the puppets for ""Sesame Street.""  It's their own style.  You can't mimic yourself.  Also, ""The Happytime Murders"" is directed by Brian Henson, who is not only Jim's son, but was the director of ""The Muppets Christmas Carol,"" ""Muppet Treasure Island"" and the TV show ""Sid the Science Kid.""  And he's listed as producer on almost every Henson Company project.  In fact, my guess is that most of the puppeteers on ""The Happytime Murders"" are the same people who work on ""Sesame Street.""  So this is not an all out war.  But I don't think it's deliberate free publicity either.  This is the marketing people at Sesame Workshop unhappy with the marketing people at STX Entertainment, and worried about parents taking their kids to this movie without knowing anything about it.  Which, sadly, is going to happen anyway.  But at least this way they can convincingly argue that they did their due diligence to circumvent that.&&>  is 100% ruffling feathers.

They're dragging Big Bird into this?&&hilariously, the filmmaker is the fucking *son* of Jim Henson, being sued by Sesame Street PR... &&Sometimes companies are obligated to file suit or risk losing their copyright/trademark/licenses &&It’s not just that... in trademark law, one is required to challenge any infringement or risk losing your mark.&&Sorry. You can't possibly be suggesting this kind of concept could work as well with just generic puppets, that don't resemble Muppets.&&Big, yellow feathers&&Big yellow feathers to be exact. &&Obviously, its intent is greatly at odds with the intent of the kid's show, but fair use seems like it might have a case for a show that's clearly only intended as a parody and nothing more. I'm guessing both properties won't want to challenge that as far as setting any new legal precedents for fair use, but that they'll reach a settlement before it reaches that point. On the other hand, I'm pretty surprised if they didn't plan ahead for something like this, even if they didn't get something specifically in writing, which I imagine they did. 

As a non-lawyer who anals frequently, I often wonder if some of these lawsuits are theirselves publicity stunts, mutually beneficial, crossovers in a way, masquerading as legal pursuit. If it doesn't make it to court, no harm caused, no judge's time wasted and who would be the wiser?&&Not just obligatory out of PR either. Part of American trademark law requires trademark owners to actively defend their mark or risk losing it to genericide or loss of meaning. &&not to mention, this movie looks pretty awful.  &&Please tell me you made that feather pun intentionally.&&I saw that trailer and thought it was odd they could get away with that.

Apparently not.&&I thought the same. I was rather shocked they would do that to their branding and risk the wrath of parents. &&I certainly didn't assume they signed off on it, but it seemed like fair use to me.  The idea of sesame Street is basically permeated in western culture now. &&Most people won't hear about the lawsuit, so the damage is done. &&Yea, after watching that trailer I thought that they had some involvement/sign off with this new movie. I’m still confused tbh. &&When I saw that trailer, I said “I hope someone at Jim Henson signed off on that.”  Oops. &&""Sex Ed with Kermit and Ms Piggy"".&&They can join the ones that took their kids to deadpool because it was a superhero movie.

To some people they see a subject like puppets and instantly go 'kids movie' and you could show gratuitous sex in the trailer and they'd still not get it.
&&Well to be fare at the beginning of the trailer they do make a point that its directed by the same person as 3 Muppet films [link](https://youtu.be/-eks8LG72uo?t=10s) then talks about revealing what happens when the kids aren't around implying its part of that universe.&&I mean, the title is literally ""The Happytime Murders"". I don't think I would bring a kid to a movie with ""murders"" in the title, or if I was considering it, I would at least look it up first.&&The same thing happened with Sausage Party.&&People need to research what they're showing their kids, but that's parenting so some people don't.&&> I think there's gonna be a lot of confused parents and crying kids.

We've had this trailer situation just recently.&&It's clearly inferred that it is a Muppet movie. Way to devalue a brand.&&Fair enough, it's the parent's fault for not bothering to take the 30 seconds it takes to read a quick summary on their smartphones. &&Yeah but never pander to the retards that take their kids to super rated R movies. Let em complain on facebook just make your movie&&Those idiots deserve it for bringing their crosseyed spawn to a movie without looking it up first.&&Sesame Street would never license anything like that.&&That's exactly why they have to sue.&&Common misconception, but Jim Henson did not create *Sesame Street*. The show was already in the works when he was brought in by Joan Ganz Cooney, and he was initially reluctant to even join. Obviously he did create the puppets and had a major impact on the show's success, but even in that case, the Hensons have had very little to do with the show in decades and Sesame Workshop now has ownership of the characters.

Debatedly, Sesame Workshop could use Brian Henson's involvement as contributing to the confusion of Sesame Workshop's involvement since this mistake is often made, though I doubt that would get very far.&&In any way... except the _____.

But like ya said, different strokes for different folks. Even though I didn't dig the trailer, I'll probably give it a whirl.&&Makes sense. I'd literally never heard of the movie until today. &&Well, the negative buzz/controversy spin worked so well for Sausage Party and Ghostbusters...&&People get mad at FOX over Firefly, but Greg the Bunny's cancellation was the real travesty.&&And while I totally get that desire, and even identify with it a little bit, ultimately I'd have to say let *Avenue Q* stay on the stage where it works best.

Saw it 10 years ago on Broadway. Saw it again late last year and... It feels a little dated. 'Internet is for porn' and 'everyones a little bit racist' aren't really timely anymore.

It's called Happytime MURDERS for crying out loud. Avenue Q, sure, but not Happytime Murders.&&[deleted]&&The movie literally has the word ""Murders"" in it.  If parents are idiots enough to take their children to it then it's their fault.  &&Wait, I don't see Kaitlin Olsen anywhere in the cast...&&Isn't Sesame Workshop an entirely unrelated entity that happens to contract in the Henson Company?  Leaving Henson et al to do things like the Muppet films, Puppet Up etc &&There's some truth to this but it's mostly bullshit.

There's a supreme court case establishing that copyright holders are free to allow or go after infringers without risk to losing their ability to enforce it, soo no, they aren'y obligated.

There ARE ways you can lose your trademark due to lack of use or enforcement, but they are relatively niche and most of the cases where a trademark holder goes after stuff like fan projects wouldn't ever have risked it. Basically, if you cease to use your trademark AT ALL for a long period of time, it just expires and you lose access to it, but that also means you not releasing any products with it for an extended period of time, so that's not applicable. There's also ""Genericization"", which is where a given/trademark/brand name is so ingrained in common parlance that it becomes synmonous with the type of product or service it is.

Yo-yo and Frisbee are examples of Genririczed trademarks: they used to be specific brands, but the terms because so associated with the type of toy they and to the general public was just what that type of toy as called, the trademark holders lost their right to it. 

This is why Nintendo actually had a good justification to be so anal about people calling all video game consoles ""nintendos"" back in the 80's, since that WOULD have potentially caused the trademark to genericize. But shutting stuff down like Pokemon fangames or anything else? That's just the companies being posssive, they could allow those if they wanted to. &&Yeah, I heard in a podcast about copyrights that if they don’t file a suit or grievance or whatever, then in future uses of their brand they won’t have a leg to stand on because they didn’t defend against a previous one.&&Meet'cha down at the big yellow joint?&&I assumed that since Brian Henson's directing Happytime Murders the Jim Henson Company must have been at least somewhat involved and they were able to get away with it that way.

""This is **outrageous!** I demand a refund! I took my 6 year old daughter to see this movie because it had the word 'puppy' in it! How was I supposed to know it would be bad for her?""

&&There are some pretty stupid/trashy parents out there. While the name will be a flag for most parents, human stupidity is boundless&&Many parents?  Yes.  All parents?  No.&&It happened with “death to smoochy” too&&Ooh, I'm a dad, let me give this a shot!  ""You see, Susie, when they made the puppet, they used too much glue, and then they didn't give it enough time to dry.  Then when the puppeteer put his hand in, a seam opened up and the glue came shooting out.  It was a mistake on the set, but then the director thought it was so funny that they decided to leave it in.""&&Yes, it's completely their fault.  But it's going to happen.  A lot.&&Yup. They used to be one and the same. Then [Henson/the Muppets split from Sesame Street] (http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2000/120400.shtml)&&That's a massive exaggeration&&Well, The Henson Company is involved, they're making the film, but that involvement doesn't let them use the Sesame Street license.

The Henson Company and Sesame Street aren't related anymore.

THC was sold to a German company by Henson's kids in 2000. That company had financial trouble and sold the rights to Sesame Street to Sesame Workshop (formerly Children's Television Workshop). A few years after that, Disney wanted to buy THC but that fell through and they ended up selling it back to Henson's family, who then sold the Muppets to Disney a year later.

So now, Sesame Workshop owns Sesame Street, Disney owns the Muppets, and The Henson Company retains the rights to everything else (The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Fraggke Rock, The Storytelker, Farscape, Dinosaurs, etc).&&I think my parents would've let me see Deadpool. They let me watch Barbarella at that age. It was horror movies my mom worried about because I would get scared at night. My dad let me watch Creep Show and it haunted me for years. My mom let me watch The Witches of Eastwick and she watched it first to make sure it was ok. &&But it's a family movie. &&Deadpool 1 had an extended sex montage featuring pegging.

Yeah, I'm sure the sequel will be great for the family!&&The trailer seems to imply it's a buddy cop movie with puppets. Comedy is essentially ""let's do extreme stuff with muppets"" that you find often in this comedy atmosphere today.

There's no crossovers, so we don't get to see Elmo doing cocaine off of a stripper if that's what you're looking for.&&>like fucking rated R who framed roger rabit 


I'm sad that people are not comparing it to the Peter Jackson 'masterpiece' Meet the Feebles &&Was supposed to be a puppet noir movie, but that's not what got greenlit unfortunately. The fact it's still Brian Henson means it should still be good if STX was hands off.&&Pretty sure it is&&[*Let me get some sleep.*](https://youtu.be/nrsKWzC4WxE)  

Still great. &&So basically we got to not rapey Spike is best Spike. &&And then continuing to jizz after a short break to catch his breath.

I'm not saying it was up there with *Schindler's List*, but it wasn't bad.

*There is no privacy, that's our policy.*&&In Sausage Party's case the controversy came after with the whole graphic food orgy scene at the end and parents taking their kids to the animated movie.

""OMG, I can't believe this is a children's cartoon! Why were there no warnings?!""&&Change that to Ponysnuggle Clusterfuck and parents with 6-year-old girls will line up around the block.&&I was at a movie theater once and a witnessed a mother screaming at the employees threatening to sue because she took her 6 year old and 9 year old kids to watch [This Is The End](https://g.co/kgs/pi8ibY). Some parents are fucking stupid. Also they watched the whole movie before she came out screaming. &&The parents who take their kids to see it would have taken them to see it no matter what the movie was. See Deadpool.&&Any parent who is paying so little attention that they buy a ticket for a movie and don't notice the title contains the word '**murders**' aren't going to notice the lawsuit filed against such a movie by sesame street either.

The second is a million times more obscure than the name. - We can argue that Sesame Street is just covering their ass legally, (and they probably are) but there *is* a limit to the law, and I seriously doubt any court would find sesame responsible for an idiot who is so clearly negligent going to see a movie made by another studio who just happened to use things that are similar to them. That would be moronic.

And as much as people like to make fun of it, most things that happen in the US Justice System DO make logical sense if you look at the *details* rather than just the headlines.

Though who am I kidding, this is Reddit.&&I'm either way drunker than I thought (always possible), or this makes no sense to someone not fully involved in the burning fire that is copyright. &&People here hate children in movie theaters but forget when they were underage all they wanted to watch was Robocop and Terminator. 

Those movies even got children’s cartoons made of them.

*How did we not learn this lesson?*&&Was it really that long ago?&&THC used to own the rights to the characters of Sesame Street as well as the Muppets.

In the 2000's Jim Henson's kids sold the company to some Germans.

The Germans sold off Sesame Street to make some money, and then sold the rest of company back the Henson family.

The Henson family sold off the Muppets to Disney to make some money.

Now the Henson Company is back under Henson family control, but without any rights to Sesame Street or The Muppets.&&The way I see it, if a parent is good enough in raising their child, the child should be mature enough to handle a movie like Deadpool without it being a problem. It's not like these movies are made to influence or decieve people. However, if a parent was responsible enough to raise their child right, they'd know what's in the movie before allowing their children to see it. 

My only problem are the people who complain about how it's a horrible movie for kids when the movie was never advertised as a children's movie. Movies like Deadpool and Sausage Party go out of their way to ensure an R rating so people know it's not for children, and parents still freak out and complain&&I don't think they're blaming the kids for wanting to watch, they're blaming the parents for not being responsible enough to say no, or at least do research on what the movie is before saying yes.&&Only children's cartoons I remember Deadpool in is the cancelled Spider-Man cartoon tbh&&I think the biggest part of Roger Rabbit was seeing all the toons together. There's no crossover opportunity here, and the cameos they could do aren't gonna happen since it's a children's show and all.

Raunchy comedy is sadly all we get from comedy movies. You want non-raunchy comedy, you watch Avengers.&&It's Melissa McCarthy so jizz humor is the pinnacle&&Consider yourself lucky. I saw DP2 last weekend and this trailer played and it seemed like at least half the theater burst out laughing. I was just sitting there thinking ""I thought Melissa McCarthy was doing better than this, what happened?""&&I thought it was funny&&In my full theater opening night of Deadpool 2, the whole theater (probably around 350ish people) was laughing a lot, and it was a fairly even split between Men and Women.

I really liked the darker parts.&&Well, after seeing the trailer I said to myself, “basically Roger Rabbit with puppets”, so at least some of that flavor has been retained.&&That sounds hella baller! I hope it still retains a little bit of the emotional bleakness lol&&Ha. Basically what Watchmen was originally supposed to be when they wanted to use the DC characters too. 

I like the premise, but the crude jokes could make it unwatchable. If it took self more seriously it could have been better imo&&Even though it's blue, this image from the early look linked up above reminds me of the Angel puppet from Smile Time actually. http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the-happytime-murders-concept-art-2.jpg&&[deleted]&&Smile Time is a masterpiece.&&Not just what they learned, they recycled the Skeksis for one episode.&&Gold and blood, they were Flint's trademarks

Five years has gone so fast.&&I can't be more appreciative of your efforts to help me understand this....come have some bourbon and we'll discuss it. &&> Now the Henson Company is back under Henson family control, but without any rights to Sesame Street or The Muppets.

But they're still making the puppets for both, correct?&&I don't think young children should really be exposed to that sort of graphic violence. The next time you're wondering if a certain amount of violence is okay for a young viewer then think about showing them a video with the same level of gore but real, would you let a kid watch a navy safety video that depicts a man being torn in half from an accident? If not then why would it be okay to show then the same thing being done to people in a film?&&It seems like Melissa McCarthy plays the same character in every movie she is in.&&Thinking she's doing better than that is almost as big a joke as her career.&&One of the people I went to DP2 with leaned over to another buddy to whisper ""that looks pretty good.""

I need to rethink the people I associate with&&At my DP2 screening it was all groans and awkward fidgeting during that trailer.

Literally every other movie also needs to have McCarthy in it too, apparently.

This concept would have been so much more interesting had they stuck to the dark humor and style of Roger Rabbit, and didn't go for cheap laughs ala cum scene.&&The thing that made Roger Rabbit work well was that the main character hated the cartoon characters, and he had a good reason to, plus he fit that classic image of the hardened detective in a corrupt city.

In general, the three companies are perfectly fine with each other, it's just this movie went a little too far towards the Sesame Street brand.&&They do for Sesame Street, but not The Muppets 

Sesame Street is filmed at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, which is right down the street from what used to be The Muppet Workshop but is now called Jim Henson's Puppet Workshop for obvious legal reasons.

That's where the Sesame Street puppets are still created.

&&Oh no. Not Suits. Please don’t come to Suits.&&I liked her in Home Sweet Hell. &&I'd hate to have to watch that on mushrooms. &&Let's also not forget Dinosaurs, that series was and still is amazing in how well it holds up.&&I wouldn't surprise me.  It's kind of expected that the marketing people would latch on to the novelty of ""hard R muppet movie"" and amphasize that heavily in trailers, especially the red band trailer.  That's a lot easier to market than ""noire comedy that happens to feature Muppets.""

It's possible that the final movie will.be overloaded with ""let's go overboeard with the R rating for the novelty of it,"" but it could easily be like Team America, mostly witty satire and using the puppets for physical comedy with one hard R puppet sex scene and I think the marketing people would focus on playing in the R rating either way.&&With any luck it'll turn out to be an ad-campaign only scene that was never intended to make it into the film.&&And, considering what Roger Rabbit was at the time...Hoskins' kind of being a little put off by the whole process comes through just a little in his interaction with the ""Toons"".&&The blue one has a more triangular-shaped head.&&Ah, right.

He has had a lot of solid projects and not as some non speaking side character, but actually major leading and supporting roles. It's very rare to see, not just asian-american actors, but also TV actors in general to continue to have an interesting career like that.&&Steven Yeun was lucky to get off Walking Dead right as it turned to absolute shit.&&Trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi6Kw7V8gXk&&I imagine people in Hollywood are mentally recasting this as we speak.&&It received an average 3.8 out of 4 by the Jury yesterday.

It's directed by Lee Chang-dong, who's made *Poetry*, *Secret Sunshine*, and *Oasis*. He pretty much only makes great movies.

Lee Chang-dong is a true master of the craft, and doesn't have a single bad movie in his name. Can't wait to see this one, although it's going to be a while before it gets a US release. &&Funny how this movie is acclaimed but the leads are currently hated by Koreans. I hope they'll look beyond their grudges and give them a chance.&&As an Asian male growing up in America you feel like an alien. There is no one who looks like you on talk shows, in movies, anywhere. People talk about underrepresented groups. Ironically they don't talk about the most underrepresented group in the media, Asian men. I love to have some representation. I make it a point to buy or watch anything with Asian men in it. It makes me feel like I belong on this planet a little bit to see some representation. &&I'm so excited for everything Steven Yeun does now. I'm very, very much looking forward to Sorry To Bother You as well \(which he is also in\).

EDIT: I also loved him in The Walking Dead&&Hell, even **David Ehlrich** gave this a 5. It's gonna be phenomenal.&&I speak for many clicking on to this thread, I only wanted TW for Steven Yeun.

I’ve seen too many common trends of Asian Americans actor’s careers rapidly declining after their main gig is over. 
I’m so proud that he’s still staying afloat.&&He was good in Mayhem.&&Steven Yeun will always have a special place in my heart because as an Asian kid it had been ingrained in me that Asian actors are meant to play Asian roles. 

Then the pilot episode of TWD aired, and at the end someone radios Rick in a solid American accent and it surprised me to learn later that it was some skinny Asian guy and not a typical frontman White person. 

Maybe I hadn't been watching proper movies up till then but I'd always had the impression that Asians were relegated to stylized race-centered roles.&&Steven Yeun is a phenomenal actor. After his death on TWD, I was really rooting for him to continue to succeed, and I’m glad he has&&The walking dead died with glenn.&&Imo he should be in way more stuff as lead. He has a ton of cred from twd and he left right as it jumped the shark.

He’s one of the best characters on Trollhunters. &&I’m really happy for him, he was splendid on TWD and although that show has been up and down since its beginning, it really started to suffer once he was gone.

I will definitely, absolutely be seeing this.&&He was also great in TWD. I think it really helped spring board his career. &&Right now he's currently in a scandal in Korea due to liking the rising sun flag.&&He’s one of the nicest celebs I’ve ever met at cons.  He was chatting it up with random people and taking pics just walking around the floor.  He and the Hound from Game of Thrones are awesome to meet. &&Thanks for filling me in. I really thought he was done after twd. Was just talking to my girlfriend of how we haven't seen Glen in anything&&It helps me deal with my favorite character leaving that show. (JK, I mourn his death everyday.) &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi6Kw7V8gXk

Trailer is great. Super moody vibe. &&Though he recently got into a pretty serious controversy in South Korea so I wonder what he will do next - more American or more Korean projects.&&Jon Bernthal's career really took off after TWD  
  
Small roles in big hit movies like The Wolf of Wall Street and Sicario and Mr Wolff  
Supporting roles in Fury and of course now he's The Punisher on Netflix  
  
Thingis Andrew Lincoln and Melissa McBride are (imo) the two best actors on the show but I don't see them having much success after the show  
  &&Mayhem! Loved that movie. &&He's in Sorry to bother you, coming up this summer as well. Looking gooood...&&Does he speak Korean?&&Yoo Ah In is one of the greatest talents in South Korea, let alone the globe.  He learned to play the piano for each scene as a genius pianist for the art series, “Secret Love Affair.” 

About a 20-year old who falls in love with his 40 year old teacher, whose life is dominated by the elite and has missed out on most of life’s happiness.  She and Ah In’s character fall in love through the piano.  It’s on Netflix.  Each episode is a work of art.  I can’t wait to see Burning!&&No kidding. Great timing&&It was bad for a while before his character died though. After the 3rd plot repetition, I already had enough. 
And yet I still watch it for no reason sometimes.&&He didn't leave in Season 2 though?&&I love Glens intro to the show. I loved his character, stopped watching after he died&&I’ve only ever watched the show and haven’t really read  the graphic novels. He was one of my favorite characters in the show and once it happened I just stopped watching. &&The show turned to shit after S1 so he was in it while it sucked a lot&&Its not like the other actors have screwed their careers tho. Just look at Danai Gurira, who was excellent in Black Panther&&It was never good.&&The cliffhanger bit was when i checked out.

Knew what was going to happen from the comics but just couldnt take cheap clickbait tricks instead of entertainment.

LOST somehow figured out how to do cliffhangers alongside good stories, but even that was disappointing in the end.&&What are the biggest plot spoilers of twd since his death? Havent watched it after him gone.&&To be fair, it's been shit for quite some time. Mediocre mindless entertainment at best. &&He’s shown to be a fantastic actor too, so being killed off in that show was a blessing for the guy because so many good roles have opened up for him. &&TWD has always been shit, and at best it wasn't total shit. I honestly don't know how people can continue to watch it, when it became unbearable from season 2 itself. Season 1 was ok. Now it's just the equivalent of people watching static for an hour.&&That was a good trailer. Doesn't give away much!&&Wow. I'm hooked, I need to see it. The first big Korean film I saw in the day was Brotherhood of War and it's been a great ride seeing what comes out of there since.&&That is a damn good trailer. I’ll have to check out the movie. &&It looks sort of interesting, but I don’t get the “wow” factor everyone here and in the YT comments is raving about.&&I have no idea what this is about but the hype has me intrigued.&&bad trailer imo - no one here would give it a second thought if not for the “OMG BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY OF CANNES” &&Steven Yeun could play the role in two languages!&&Starring Robert Pattinson as Steven Yeun, featuring an asian sidekick to keep things diverse.&&That made me laugh. But it's also very true and very sad.&&*In a world...*&&Josh Brolin stars as...&&>Should definitely be in the conversation of Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars next year.

In case it is submitted to the Oscars. South Korea has often chosen more unexpected movies for the Oscars. They will probably go with it though, as they had already submitted two Lee Chang-dong movies in the past. &&Oasis blew my fucking mind. I can't watch it again though knowing how heavy it is, but that should absolutely entice anybody who hasn't seen it yet. It's isn't talkee about much, but it's brilliant. Was free with Amazon Prime streaming recently too, if I recall correctly. &&> Should definitely be in the conversation of Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars next year.

I hope so but I'm not 100% optimistic. There's a lot of Korean movies that should have been nominated for an Oscar but didn't. South Korea has a habit of submitting to the competition its most popular movies, instead of its most critically acclaimed. &&Secret Sunshine is so hard to watch. I can't wait to see Burning.&&What’s up with “foreign language” being a blanket category? People don’t speak english and suddenly its not viable as anything else. Thats so antiquated.&&Poetry was an amazing movie with one of my favorite performances by a lead actress ever.&&If anyone hasn’t seen Poetry, watch it. Such an amazing movie. That just gets me more excited to see Burning now.&&What is this film about??&&You had me at 3.8&&Poetry was amazing!&&Definitely. Read praises about his acting but I never bothered to check him out. Saw the k-movie ""The Throne"" and I was blown away by his acting. Saw another film of his and again, he was impressive. Solid actor. &&I remember being absolutely obsessed with him in sungkunkwan scandal. It's amazing but not surprising to see how far he's come.&&great actor, not just good. one of the best Korea has to offer. &&I love every single bit of Chicago Typewriter because of him. His acting is so intense especially on the last episode. god i will never forget that drama.&&I really hope that 1Q84 ends up getting turned into a mini series or something. I feel like they would have to get the exact right person to do it to make it work though. &&You’re right. Voltron IS a masterpiece. &&What other masterpieces is he in?&&Please, check Okja.

[Okja - Netflix Trailer] (https://youtu.be/AjCebKn4iic)&&Nowhere for now. It'll get picked up by a distributor very soon but it probably won't get a US release for at least 5-7 months. Maybe longer.&&I would also like to know this&&In Korea it's already in theaters. Just saw and it blew my mind&&If your in LA it’ll prolly screen at CGV in a month or so &&Anyone? &&How did you get to see it? &&Are there English subtitles?&&How trailers should be. Fuck 2 mins plot synopses &&From imdb synopsis

>Jong-soo, a part-time worker, bumps into Hae-mi while delivering, who used to live in the same neighborhood. Hae-mi asks him to look after her cat while she's on a trip to Africa. When Hae-mi comes back, she introduces Ben, a mysterious guy she met in Africa, to Jong-soo. One day, Ben visits Jong-soo's with Hae-mi and confesses his own secret hobby.

They do have some average movies and duds. But they make great thriller films because they tend to be less formulaic than movies in other genres (like the rom-com or family types). &&I remember reading somewhere that it has to do with the idea of revenge, family and isolation that's in their culture. Their society and cultural touchstones raises people in a way that lets them convey those ideas in a very specific and effective style. If I had to choose, I'd say that South Korean action/thrillers are my favourite genre.&&Might get picked up by Netflix in the future. They’re slowly adding more to their Korean movie and drama section. &&that ti4 finals where he reverse swept eg in a bo7 was truly something&&Literally what the hell is this movie about?

I actually prefer them to his novels (which I still like a lot, but his short stories are sooooo good).

The Elephant Vanishes and Men Without Women are both super strong collections.&&Thankfully, no.  Murakami is nothing like Faulkner.  But one of Murakami's stories was translated to English with the name ""Barn Burning.""  It's not a reference to the Faulkner piece.&&Not even remotely close to the same level. He's a solid author but he's no Faulkner.&&He must be. Murakami should be required reading in Western high schools.&&Really difficult to talk about without spoiling, since it's one of those stories that you think is about one thing before realizing it was a completely different thing by the end.

But basically, a guy meets a woman at a friends wedding. She comes over to his place a few days later with her boyfriend, and the three hang out. The boyfriend is wealthy, well-traveled, and just really charming overall.

As they get drunk and stoned, the boyfriend admits that every few months, he'll find an abandoned and expendable barn, and burn it down. He doesn't really know why.

The main character becomes obsessed with figuring out which barn he'll burn down next, but never finds it...

And that's the setup (of the short story). It re-contextualizes itself by the end in a really fascinating way.&&I'd never seen this and just watched it - Amazing.  I was crying laughing.  [Link here since I have the tab open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k70xBg8en-4)

My friends have told me how terrible it's been since then. No regrets.&&It's a chore now to watch&&Really I think TWD is one of those shoes everybody wants to love so hard but the show itself makes it so hard to love. Like it has a ton of potential but they waste a good 2/3 of the episodes each season. And those last 1/3 are good enough to keep the hope alive that the next season is gonna be REALLLYYY GOOOD&&I really feel like the show took its nose dive right when they killed him off. Everything before his death was ok with me. But yeah. Not so great now. &&Season 6 was really inconsistent, but for me it wasn't until season 7 that the bad started to outweigh the good. &&The Negan scene this season with the garbage woman was hilarious. So many obvious mistakes. The woman released the leader of the people who butchered her whole gang and friends, WHOLE, only in exchange of him not burning some photos. And god knows how he managed to reach them while being restrained let alone getting a gun and a flame to burn those photos. And the way she managed to disarm him is a hilarious scene as well.

Oh, and the genius Eugene, how he managed to make the gun fires backward is beyond me.&&Just stop, dude. There's SO much good tv out there. &&Ya... I bailed after season 4. I shoulda stopped at 2.&&>He didn't leave after the pilot episode though?

ftfy&&It was amazing how powerful his death was all over the internet. Even people who don't watch the show felt sad.&&Somehow, they took a major death from the comics and made it feel like it was just killing off another character in the show for shock value. 

The show is pretty bad.&&[Sasha and Carl died. A guy with a pet tiger who speaks like he's in a Shakespeare play and calls himself ""King Ezekiel"" becomes a main character (Seriously). A group that lives in trash and talks weird shows up. Eugene switched sides then switched back. Morgan constantly hovers between crazy and slightly less crazy.

This is what Thanos decided to do with his infinity gauntlet powers, he mysteriously shows up and forms love triangles.&&*The Handmaiden* not being submitted was a travesty.&&True. I think they submit their most popular movies, instead of their most critically successful.  Or sometimes they try to be clever about it and submit movies which they think the Academy will like - and it always backfires. One exception is 2003, where they submitted Kim Ki-duk's ""Spring, summer, fall, winter, and... spring."" One of the best movies ever made, imo. 

Since the late 90s and on, the South Korean film-industry has grown to become one of the best in the world. Quality movie after quality movie, almost every year. It's about time they get an Oscar nom. &&Just checked Prime and it still is! Thanks for the recommendation! &&The two lead performances blow out the Western actors performances if we're talking Oscar winners of the last decade or so. Incredible and brave performances, the guy's performance was more subtle/better than Leo's. A hard film that I wouldn't see again. &&I thought it was absolutely heartbreaking yet everyone else I know that watched it seems to hate it.  Mainly because of the central scene when the two main characters meet.  They deem his actions irredeemable.

Those err a bit further on the magical realism side than some of his other work, but WUBC in particular is regarded extremely well. He has some more traditional work like Norwegian Wood and Sputnik Sweetheart too that is also excellent. They're all reads that are simultaneously ""breezy"" and substantive, so it's extremely comfortable to get through several books.

Both of the books I recommended were ones I couldn't bring myself to put down, and ended up reading all night until I finished them the next morning, and then had to take it easy all day to ease myself out of their world.

Going to watch this but I agree. Steven is doing all this face unseen gigs. I want to see him headlining a walking dead type show.

Even sung kang had this problem. He got out into that police and mob TV show and then that got cancelled and what's he doing now other than kit car tuneups? Code 8 but that's about it &&SOOOO much better than the Belko Experiment&&Which is exactly why the planned remake with Dwayne Johnson playing Jack Burton is going to suck. He won't be the bumbling side kick. It won't be believable.&&Most of the people in that show too, right? &&Yeeeees. I love him in Trollhunters. He has some of the best lines. My husband didn't believe me at first when I told him that was Glen from TWD.

Also, don't be ashamed. Husband and I have no kids. We can't wait for the next season of Trollhunters. Checked it out because Anton yelchin, kept watching because it's awesome.&&It was exactly the same for me! In TWD, my favorite characters tend to be the ones who remain human, empathetic and ""warm"", I guess, despite all the horror around them. Those people basically represent ""hope for the future"" to me.

So first Dale and Hershel are killed. 

Then Beth/Daryl gives us a glimmer of hope, that arc gives Daryl tons of depth and humanity ... then Beth is killed, and ever since then, Daryl has been a boring emo. And Beth was bascially the one character who I felt could be ""me"" in a zombie apocalpyse, just a normal girl with no special skills, trying to make it and still remain a good person. So two favorite characters ruined in one.

Then Noah shows up as the one good thing to come out of Beth's death. Boom, he is killed shortly after in a super gruesome way (with poor Glenn having to watch).

Tyreese, another absolute favorite of mine, is killed.

At that point, all I have left to emotionally root for is Glenn. They tease his death with the whole dumpster debacle, but he's still there ... but THEN he gets killed off after a end of season - cliffhanger? Nope, sorry, lost me there. I don't care that it happened in the comics -- they've already changed the original story around so much. And Glenn's death on its own might have been okay, if all the other shit beforehand hadn't happend, and the story in general wasn't becoming so pointless. So yeah, haven't watched a minute after Glenn's death, and from what I hear, I haven't missed very much. :/&&Thanks!&&I really hope I keep seeing more of Lordy from now on. &&It was created by Guillermo del Toro&&Yeah, Del Toro, great cast and animation, just a really well done show. The lore is fun, and they’re tying it into a show about wizards and one about aliens, all taking place in the same small town. 

I’d say my only real caveat is that its a kids show so bear in mind it’s a bit of a slow burn at first. &&It's quality animation, writing, and story--comedy is also one of the main thrusts. If you've seen TV series CG animation, you know it pales in comparison to movie CG. This is well beyond standard TV series animation and just a bit below movie quality, for like 30 some episodes. Top quality voice acting. Kelsey Grammer is fantastic. &&Ha me and the wife both said years ago we would stop when and if they killed him. Then they did and we did. No ragrets for us either &&I bailed when they killed Carl. Haven't been back&&Ragerts *&&I stopped watching when he got pulled off that dumpster and eaten. A year later I found out he was still alive and went back only to watch him die another way :(&&Korea here. **Everyone** in Korea stopped watching after he died.&&Yeah I just got tired of playing ""Who's gonna die next?"" and all the Rick death fakeouts. Like, we know they're not going to kill off Rick. Stop treating your audience like morons.

The comic is still solid, though.&&[deleted]&&Then don't.&&It was always a chore&&Yes.
The one thing that would annoy even more than the show’s repetition is if it ends with a huge cliffhanger or just ends with them at the “final safe haven” camp.
If they do end up screwing themselves over with the repetition, I hope they end it with a bang.&&I saw someone suggest that you could watch the premiere and finale of each Walking Dead season and skip the rest, and not really miss anything important. I think they're probably right.&&Just read the comic. It's as good as you want the show to be. &&That was the last episode I watched. Sounds like I should feel ok about that.&&Shit. That happened for me after like season 2.&&Have you watch any Fear the Walking Dead? I am on season 3 now and only continuing to watch it because of how bad it is. Like watching a train wreck take place. 

I just cant get over how bad some of the editing is. It's like they were counting on having more episodes per season available to them and had to cut out whole scenes to fit in the story.  &&Yeah, Glenn's death in the comics was so gut-wrenching and emotional that I had to put it down for a while. It was fucking intense. They tried to do the same on the show, but it had become such violence porn by that point, and there were so many death fakeouts, that it just didn't come through.&&Cool, thanks for the update.&&I've got to disagree. Season 1 was great stuff, no argument there. But lordy, did season 2 just drag on and on for me. It managed to pick back up by season 3, but by then it was evident to me that the writers don't have a strong concept of pacing. &&Season 2 and 3 were definitely not ""phenomenal"".&&I mean, of course, it goes without saying, one's enjoyment of the show isn't predicated on someone else's opinion. So I'm not being unfair to anyone's preferences. I respect whatever people want to tune into to unwind. It just baffles me how people still enjoyed any of it after season 1. Even season 1 was spotty. Season 4 kind of picked up and that was it. Season 3 had some ok moments. The rest has been entirely forgettable. The show has always been terrible for concrete, enumerable reasons. Not to mention it's been plagued by executive meddling since forever, leading to a bulk of its weaknesses. Saying that a show has highlights says little about the rest of it, and even the highlights were relative to its own usual quality. I've been more engaged watching run of the mill crime procedurals.&&I know how you feel. At this point when I watch movies I feel like I can predict the ending and everything in between and the more more I think about it it's all because I saw the trailer a few times.&&Now? They were faaaaaaaaar worse back in the day. Just watch a trailer from the 60's-80's, they go through the whole plot point by point.&&Fast cuts? In a trailer?! By the Gods!&&That music had my heart pounding. I have a feeling that movie will leave me an emotional wreck. I’d watch it anyway. &&I have no idea what the fuck went on in that. Like, there's a couple and then there's Steven Yeun who's supposed to be some sort of enigma or something.

Watching a trailer and still getting out of it completely unknowing just feels really weird to me. I don't know if that's good or not. &&I don't remember her speaking Korean in either of those movies! &&*Cough* Death Note *Cough*&&Too asian. How about Emma Stone?&&And he would still have to audition for the role.&&She'll be played by a half white, racially ambiguous looking Asian woman though, of course. Or maybe brunette Emma Stone. &&> It doesn’t have to be sad. We have had a few awesome American versions, like The Departed. It can be done well.

Can you name some others? The Departed is literally the only remake I've ever watched that didn't suck.&&Infernal Affairs was much better, especially without the tailor-made ending designed for American audiences.&&I still don’t understand why it wasn’t. What a masterwork of filmmaking. &&I haven't seen it but I'm guessing The Handmaiden is worth the watch?&&I mean, both Oasis and Secret Sunshine were submitted to the Oscars and neither got nominated, despite being critically acclaimed. The same with Bong Joon\-ho's Mother and Pieta by Kim Ki\-duk, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. So that's not entirely true.&&I didn’t know that!

My underlying point was that I think people should be more open to watching films in other languages, with subtitles.

Naturally the impact isnt always as great when youre reading instead of hearing your native language but there is a vast world of film that isn’t in english. I think that’s not always apparent to americans.&&>is it wasn't for that category then foreign language films would hardly be recognized.

I loved the first two, Yesterday and Drive My Car, but I've struggled with the last few.  Although each story has been able to make me feel wistful and empty at the same time, which I find to be the best of Murakami.  I find him to be best when he can really delve into stories.  IQ84 is one of my favorite reads.&&Thankfully.&&The best one was like 10 years ago or more where his fans said he looked like the president of Finland, so he went there and met her.

The overview of Israeli history in thirty seconds is amazing. &&Outgrown them? Too juvenile for ol Conan, eh?&&I read next season they are playing with the format. I believe it will only be 30minutes long with more episodes just travel showcases. &&Was recently listening to a podcast created by a couple of Youtube Let's Players, they are absolutely in awe of his raw skill.

""We played the same game before his episode aired and he says the funniest fucking things when i was struggling to keep a somewhat funny joke going, that man is pure talent.""

If Conan was born in the 90's i am sure he could be the biggest Youtuber right now.&&The last one with Bill Hader was amazing! His skits with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are great too!&&The Superbowl one with marshawn lynch and gronk is easily the best one.&&This undiscovered wunderkind has real potential.&&Didn’t know that, very cool. &&That was my favorite Korra episode.

Edit: He’s also voice acting in a new show called Final Space that is amazing &&I mean...I wouldn’t be surprised.
“They give the roles to whoever is the better actor!!” would be the defense for that if Glen *was* made to be a white dude. 
But apparently that doesn’t work in the reverse. 
&&Steven said in an interview that in the first pilot season following his departure from TWD he was offered quite a few lead roles for TV series but he turned them all down because they didn't speak to him on a personal level. He's picky about what he takes. That being said, I'm sure as an Asian-American his options are fewer than would be the case for a white actor of his experience/caliber, but look at the projects he's been doing. He's been working with some truly amazing people.&&Did you check them both out after seeing the RLM video mentioning them? I went through them both the same day. &&He was a great bumbling sidekick in Pain and Gain.&&I think The Rock could absolutely play a bumbling sidekick. He's got comedic chops and I think could be capable of swallowing the ego.

BUT I have zero confidence that the filmmakers will recognise this clever send-up that the original did, and will just assume that if The Rock is the lead, he's got to be the #1 ass kicker.&&It also doesn't make sense since the movie was a satire of movie trends at the time. But right now have we got a trend again of kung fu movies where for some reason the white guy with no training is always the one who actually saves the day? Not that I'm aware of. So what on earth is the remake going to be satirizing?&&Be the change you want to see. Whenever one of my group of friends does something ""old"" like grunt from exertion, or complain about bills/youth we say ""Lordy, lordy, I'm turnin' forty!""&&I'm from Kansas so that word has always been common place.

You should also shake your fist in the air a lot, too. And complain about lawns/taxes/""kids these days"" in as vague and as ignorant of terms as possible.

The satire is palpable&&Whoa, they killed Carl? Lol. I'm sure the subreddit was stoked.&&I would say ""Spoiler!!!"", but any sad soul who is trudging through the lead up to that would probably be glad to know that *something* noteworthy eventually happens.

My wife still watches the show, but now she has to do so by herself. I bailed once I realized the writers were too invested in Negan to provide any true resolution with his storyline.&&Same. That was the final nail in the coffin for me. Couldn't take the self-imposed abuse anymore.

Anybody know if anything remotely interesting happened since then??&&I think it's funny how everyone used to say ""TWD is lame, they have no balls - they never kill off any of the main characters!""

Then they kill off some of the main characters and people quit watching because of it.

I think we can just agree on people stopped watching it because the quality has been god awful for many seasons now.

&&Ya know the worst part of Carl's Death? (Spoilers) is that it could have been so fucking amazing...

He is one of the characters everyone just fucking *knew* was gonna survive. There's no way he could have died.... right? 

Imagine if you're watching like some 3rd episode after the season/half-season return and you see Carl just fucking trounced by a horde of undead. You see him eaten alive and didn't expect it in the least. That would have been a worthy send-off, a good move to return tension to the show, and a better piece of storytelling. 

Instead, he lives for like a week after he was bitten and has enough time to write out 6 letters, talk to everyone, and then fuck off and die.

They did Chandler so fucking wrong, too. That was what caused me to not want to watch anymore. Not because he was my favorite or anything like that but I can empathize with his situation. 

A young man, expecting to have a job for a few more years, to go to college near set, to be told before anything happens to his character. Nope. Fuck you kid who's been there since the pilot. Eat shit!&&That's an option???&&My wife and I watch it to laugh at it now.  I've always thought it was terrible, she's only recently come to that conclusion.

The first time dialogue was directed clearly to the camera so that us simpletons watching knew it was expository killed it for me. Insulting my intelligence doesn't entertain me.  That was definitely in the first season. Might have been the first half of the first season.&&I'm too invested though.. &&I watched a few episodes after that. 

A fucking ex-zookeeper with a tiger shows up pretending to be a biblical King. I was ready to quit the show there, but watched 1-2 more.

Then they spent an *entire episode* following some characters we don't know on some beach or some bullshit. I couldn't remember because I was so disengaged from it, considering how much I wanted the main story to move forward and it simply wasn't going anywhere.

Like after that season premiere I wanted to see what's happening to Rick and his gang, what the political situation is like with the Saviors and their tributary camps, and the fallout of the massacre. I got a small bit of that, but what I also got was way too much meandering and time wasting.

That's when I gave up, right around there.&&>Have you watch any Fear the Walking Dead? I am on season 3 now and only continuing to watch it because of how bad it is. Like watching a train wreck take place. 
>
>I just cant get over how bad some of the editing is. It's like they were counting on having more episodes per season available to them and had to cut out whole scenes to fit in the story.  

I can tell FTWD is a train wreck just from the commercials for it on AMC. If you can't even compile 30 seconds worth of good clips from a show, something is wrong.&&I agree, but I still think it's better than the last season of TWD.&&https://www.thepoke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9654.jpeg

Yeah season 2 was comically bad. Sure it had moments but they came from the comic or were too few. Besides do people watch a show for moments, or for the *show*? I hated the monologuing, the unearned gravitas, the soap opera interactions, the shit pacing, the inconsequential plot arcs, the inability to express coherent themes, the artificial tension, the ""who's gonna die this week?"" cheap trick they abuse, the illogical and dull characters. The list actually goes on. It really is a supremely disappointing show that in no way deserves its loyal fans.&&Didn't they switch directors or something between seasons? I heard that was the reason why season 2 was so different from season 1. &&This is why I've stopped watching trailers entirely. I don't miss them. I go into every movie with eyes as fresh as a newborn babe's! &&Atleast there wasn't *BWWWAAAHHHHHH*&&Its good. It leaves you wanting to know more and how do you do that?

I haven't seen it, but it is supposed to be pretty good as well. 

The Handmaiden contains a plethora of risque scenes and I'm honestly not sure, if it would have done well with the Academy.

Park Chan-Wook was also apparently blacklisted by the Korean government, so it might have been a political decision.&&I think it easily deserved a Best Picture nomination over *Lion*, *Hidden Figures*, and *Fences*.&&That good? Haven't seen it.

It's stupid because in the comics he is also annoying and starts to grow on fans, becomes a strong character and is being groomed for leadership after Rick's time passes, whether natural or not.  
They killed him off so now what future is Rick building the world for? The show doesn't have enough time to grow Judith into that role and Carl was perfect because he was still a child when the old world was there (remember the scene with him getting excited about finding an Xbox and games and he ends up just disappointingly taking the power cord?)  
Edited: Autocorrect sucks.&&It sparked the joke that they ""offed"" him because they didn't want to pay him an adult salary.  
Reportedly he had just bought a house near Atlanta before being told he was gonna get killed.  
Must sting.  &&Chandler Riggs, the actor for Carl, is now making EDM and playing shows, and he's actually pretty good at it. I stopped watching the show a couple years ago, so I see his death as a good thing in this respect.&&But thats what happens in the comics. And Negan turns out to be an ally for the most part. More of an anti hero everyone hates. I dont like how the show cherry picks stuff from the comics though, because their adaptations are usually underwhelming. &&Wait what? Carl died in the show?! Bahahaha, Jesus Christ. They had such good source material in the comic and just piss all over it.

God and they have him die by a stray walker bite?!?! Man these showrunners are fucking retarded. The amount they still use walkers to kill characters is so pathetic, the comic is barely even about zombies by the point in the comic that the show is at, but they probably need zombies to score well with test audiences or some shit. &&Say spoilers before you spoil it you fucking idiot&&Chandler.

The amount of passion and gusto in each frame is unparalleled and palpable.

Still curious though, in the comics are you saying Carl dies (I thought I'd heard he was really the primary POV and was still alive) or that Negan doesn't get so much a resolution as an evolution into a reluctant ally?&&No.&&All of S1 was award-winning television if you compare it to the shit-show that was all but the last episode of S2. &&The pilot is honestly the single greatest hour of televsion I've ever seen. The set design, cinematography, acting all built up this tension I've never seen matched since.&&Which is a shame. I thought the pilot episode was amazing! Tons of character development, good acting and dialogue, it showed a lot of promise. Only a couple episodes in, though, it was obvious that the writers didn't actually know how to set up conflict or drama without relying on the characters consistently making all the worst possible decisions. I don't see the appeal of watching people make obvious mistakes over and over.&&>  If this film wasn't getting all this praise this trailer would do nothing to incite anyone to watch it 

I mean, the director is highly acclaimed and pretty popular, so that's not true.&&I Saw The Devil changed my life. Truely powerful &&> Kim Jee-Woon’s best film is I Saw the Devil.

Taste is subjective, so I don't think I can change your mind, but in my opinion ""I saw the devil"" is probably his worst movie (I'm not counting the American one he did). 

Don't get me wrong, ""I saw the devil"" is a decent movie and I enjoyed very much, but doesn't reach the heights his other movies do. ""A bittersweet life"" is a masterpiece - probably his best. ""A tale of two sister"" likewise, is a wonderful horror film which both utilizes the conventions of Asian horror and at the same time subverts them. ""The good, the bad, and the weird"" is a tour de force action film, which again, both utilizes and subverts genre. His two first movies, ""The quiet family"" and ""The foul King,""  are almost never talked about but they should. They're really clever movies, and so, so much fun to watch!

""I saw the devil"" has an interesting story, an interesting take on the Moby Dick trope, but it is pretty much a straightforward thriller by Korean standards. &&>Kim Jee-Woon’s best film is I Saw the Devil.

No, that's The Good, the Bad, the Weird. Or A Tale of Two Sisters, maybe.
&&Yeah, I think ""blackballed"" would be more appropriate&&I was blown away when I finally saw it a few months ago. Not by the movie but the fact that a 2 hour long Tales from the Crip episode won an oscar.&&Yeah, that's true. But that was certainly not your usual Best Picture winner.&&If Clint Eastwood is involved, it can't be that foreign.&&Movies are more than story &&Agreed, that's it?&&Spoilers for the comic, obviously:

Carl doesn't die. He is (together with Rick) the main character of the series. Killing him would be the most stupid thing one could do. 

That would probably undermine the entire idea the comic stands for. (Can't talk about the show as I stopped watching it after the abomination that was the cliffhanger finale.)

Negan turns into an unlikely ally after Rick puts him in prison for three (?) years.

He realizes that Rick was right in the end, but keeps his irratic behaviour and often plays with the fact that a lot of people still see him as a villain.

Also he gets a sort of redemption arc and we learn that Lucille was his wife that he absolutely adored. &&As opposed to?&&That movie gave me nightmares&&Overrated. It just went so over the top and unbelievable at one of the climactic scenes that me and my friend just turned it off. Finished it at a later date and all I can remember is being underwhelmed.&&Ummm A Bittersweet Life you uncultured swine!!!!&&Crypt. Tales from the Crip sounds like a bad 90s rap album.&&Right, that was my point in singling it out&&So...are you foreign? Well...are ya, punk?&&Dammit, now you're making me want to jump into the comic.

Thanks for the clarification!&&That still seems like a pretty terrible story to me. How could anyone from the group, especially Maggie or her child, or Rosita, ever be okay with him becoming an ally? He sociopathically murdered a completely innocent person in a sadistic torture game. There can be no redemption from that, and even attempting it seems stupid. That would be like a redemption arc for Ramsay Bolton.&&I'm always surprised to see it garner so much acclaim when it comes up. It was enjoyable but the entire second act is a pretty big drag. The first and third have an incredible pace but it definitely goes off the rails during the second.&&The Good, the Bad, and the Weird is my favorite, but Bittersweet Life is a close second. That movie fucking wrecked me.&&Lol! Westside&&[Maggie is most definitely NOT okay with it. She tries to put him down herself, in fact, before realizing he is just as broken as everyone else and killing him would give her no satisfaction. Also, the best thing Negan gets from Rick is freedom, he's eventually kicked out of their community and left to fend for himself. That's the last we see of Negan.](#spoiler)
&&Ehhhh, did he though? A lot of the people he killed he did so for a reason. I mean, before killing Glen he had just had a whole team of his men slaughtered by Rick and his gang. 

Negan was just operating a feudalistic style of government. He killed pretty strategically in order to keep order and to keep those underneath him, some of whom were sociopaths, in check. Not saying he was a good guy, but he wasn’t a Ramsay Bolton. I really think Negan had some greater good in mind (no matter how misguided his approach may have been). 

Ramsey Bolton just enjoyed killing for the sake of killing. Negan tried to make it look like he enjoyed killing to appear strong in order to maintain control of a populous he thought would be even more brutal without him in charge.&&",2018-05-18 16:31:46
'Superman' actress Margot Kidder dead at 69,27343,8jdw7f,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/05/14/superman-actress-margot-kidder-dead-69/,1277,1526317169.0,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Kidder#Personal_life

> Kidder was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which was the cause of a widely publicized manic episode that she experienced in April 1996. At the time, Kidder had been working on an autobiography, when her laptop computer was infected with a virus, which caused it to crash and her to lose three years' worth of drafts. Kidder flew to Los Angeles to have the computer examined by a data retrieval company, who ultimately were unable to retrieve the files. Kidder then entered a manic state and disappeared for four days. She was found in a backyard by a homeowner and was taken by the Los Angeles Police Department to Olive View Medical Center in a distressed state, the caps on her teeth having been knocked out during a rape attempt. She was later placed in psychiatric care.

Wow, that's pretty rough. RIP&&She had the best Random Roles interview ever: https://film.avclub.com/random-roles-margot-kidder-1798215851

RIP Margot. Glad I got to meet this woman years ago at Boston Wizard World. Such a light in a conversation, she had amazing stories. &&Sorry to hear it. She was the definitive Lois Lane to me.&&Truly defined the role of Lois Lane. Loved how she portrayed her&&And Christopher Reeves isn't even around anymore to reverse the spin of the earth.&&When I was a kid, I was crazy about *Superman: The Movie* and *Superman II* (especially the first one), but for me it was all about Christopher Reeve. I will admit that I just didn't care for Margot Kidder's Lois Lane.

It was only upon revisiting the movies many years later as an adult that I gained an appreciation for Margot Kidder. Not only did she hold her own playing against the immensely charismatic Christopher Reeve, she did it with aplomb. She painted an indelible portrait of Lois Lane that I will forever associate with the character. She was all at once strong, brassy, vulnerable, wryly funny, a bit scatterbrained, and incredibly relatable. To a child watching the movies, that's just who Lois Lane *is*; only later comes the realization that Margot Kidder created this persona out of whole cloth.

I will forever be grateful for Margot Kidder and her invaluable contribution to the wonder that a whole generation was lucky enough to experience. I firmly believe that her Lois Lane will never be surpassed.

What a Super Woman.&&My favourite line from the superman films;

**Perry White**: I don't understand you, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring me three thousand boring pictures. Yet Superman saves a man from drowning on 3rd Avenue this morning while you stand there watching the whole thing and you don't even bring me one picture.

**Jimmy Olsen**: Chief, I didn't have my camera with me.

**Perry White**: A photographer *eats* with his camera. A photographer *sleeps* with his camera.

**Lois Lane**: I'm glad I'm a writer. &&She was a fantastic (arguably the best) Lois Lane.  Sassy, driven, and more realistically oblivious of Clark.  &&I had a wonderful experience with her backstage at a comics convention. 

She was due to appear at a Q&A panel, and it was my job to escort her back and forth between the Celebrity Row area and the ballroom for her panel. She regaled me with stories about her life the whole way.

We also had a number of Star Trek celebrities at the same show. 

Afterwards we were walking through the access corridors of the convention center, turned a corner and encountered Marina Sirtis and Michael Dorn who were on the next panel. Marina Sirtis cried out, ""Oh, Margot Kidder!"" and the two ladies exchanged emotional hugs. ""It's so great to see you!!""

As we walked on back to Margot's table in Celebrity Row, I asked, ""So, how do you and Marina Sirtis know each other?"" I expected a story about a project they worked on together.

She looked at me. ""Oh, is that who that was?""&&Sad. The early 80's superman films with the John Williams soundtrack were my favorite. Also way too early, and suprising for a female to go that young.

&&No one else has even come close to her Lois Lane. &&https://i.imgur.com/w2WKAr0.png&&Thank you, Margot for bringing an amazing character to life and making my childhood fantastic. RIP. &&She maintained a close relationship with Superman star Christopher Reeve for the rest of his life saying,  ""When you're strapped to someone hanging from the ceiling for months and months, you get pretty darned close.""  RIP.&&[deleted]&&""What color underwear am I wearing?""&&This is truly a heartbreaker. She is loved, and will be missed. What an icon.&&I have an autograph from her, as well as a picture with her from around 9-10 years ago.  I go to a lot of cons, I've met a lot of celebrities at this point.

Margot Kidder remains the absolute nicest celebrity I've met.  Probably one of the nicer people I've met period.  She just instantly was so warm and inviting to talk to.  Just my friend and I were at her line, and it was like she was happy to just sit and talk with us as long as we could.  

She'll always be my Lois Lane.  &&She was so amazing and funny in [Black Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMqvsVU3luQ)&&Has anyone tried spining the earth backwards yet?&&I had the privilege of meeting Margie at Standing Rock and actually spending quite a bit of time with her. She was one of the strongest women I have ever met. She had more fire and passion about what she believed in than most people have about anything. I'll never forget seeing a tiny little woman trying to walk a Great Pyrenees puppy in the middle of a blizzard. I offered to help as I used to be a dog trainer, and when she pulled back her hood it was Lois Lane! She was so sweet and had such a huge heart, and genuinely just wanted to help everyone she could. I'm absolutely heartbroken to hear this news. You lived an amazing life Margie, and I'm truly grateful to have been lucky enough to get to know you.&&First Princess Leia and now Lois Lane. Who’s next, Wonder Woman (Linda Carter)? My childhood crushes are perishing far too soon.&&Amazing actress and woman who suffered from mental illness but didn't let that stop her. A left wing activist, she openly questioned the first gulf war and the iraq war, had been on record against fracking and the extension of the keystones pipeline. A strong powerful woman, she will be missed.&&This is really sad :(&&That’s too bad. I once saw her at a farmer’s market talking to a dog. R.I.P.&&Nice.&&[:c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgsnWtBQm0)&&This scene represents the best of Margot Kidder, and its the scene near the end where Lois already knows Clarks real identity and breaks down. Its really tugs the heart because you can hear deep down the emotion Lois is feeling towards Clark. Will be missed deeply.

Edit: couldn't find a higher res of this clip plus the post\-amnesia scene&&The best Lois

RIP&&The best Lois Lane, honestly.&&Sad news. Reeves Superman was so good in part due to how well Kidder and he played off each other. They were great in I and II, the definitive Supes/Lane on-screen.&&She's flying with Christopher now.&&RIP Lois.&&This made me very sad this morning. She lived for a time near my high school and came to all our plays, making sure to come backstage and wish us all broken legs. Nothing but class...it always made me very sad to see how she struggled sometimes. 

RIP, Ms. Kidder, I was very pleased to know you for the short time I did.&&Back in the '90s, my mom dated this guy who worked at a hotel in which Margot stayed for a short period. When she checked out, she handed my mom's (now ex-) bf a bouquet of flowers she had been given, saying, ""Here: give these to your sweetheart. I can't travel with 'em, and it'd be a shame to see them go to waste!"" I still remember my mom bringing them home that day, declaring, ""We got flowers from Lois Lane!"" :) RIP, MK.&&She was a great Lois Lane. So feisty and charming. Just lovely. That helicopter scene still freaks me out.&&69, nice&&nice&&RIP, but nice.&&Love *Black Christmas*&&""You've got me? Who's got you?!""&&Always loved Margot's Lois. Perfect casting. This is so sad.&&Superman 1-4 and *The Amityville Horror*...Those were her only big roles, but she worked right up to the end.

I hope I live as long.&&Easily the best Lois Lane&&Heartbreaking. She seems like such a pleasant lady&&This sad news makes me want to go and watch Margot's 1980's [Tab commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF31JDJMCsw).  She seemed so much happier in those days.&&I had the pleasure of speaking with her over the phone once while working for a hotel in Burbank. She was a bit confused about the shuttle service but was cordial and sweet. RIP.&&Both of them now are in heaven.&&Another legends passes away. RIP Ms Lane.&&R.I.P.&&My first childhood crush. She was so beautiful to my little 7 year old self. This is sad. 😢&&""Who **are** you?""

RIP Margot Kidder. &&Rip Margot Kidder&&Been big news where I live. She was born here, we have have a lane named in her honour. Lois Lane. &&I met her once at a comic convention. She was a very sweet lady.&&RIP. There still isn't a Lois Lane in movies who has even come close to surpassing her take on the character (Erica Durance and Dana Dalenay could be contenders but that's television).&&Cause Superman wasn't there to protect her.&&Nice&&Nooooo I love her in Sisters and Black Christmas. Absolutely great actress and a truly beautiful woman. RIP&&[In Memoriam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHqSnh1UfKA)&&Hey Reddit, while you're mourning this actress and activist, could you acknowledge what she was fighting against without letting it get astroturfed out of existence?

RIP&&Nice&&nice.&&Nice&&Nice&&I was only 6, I had a ""Super"" crush on her! also in Superman 2... sad news.
&&Fuck. Way too soon.

She'll always be Lois Lane to me. &&This scene from Superman The Movie is probably how I'll remember her.

wow. RIP Margot.&&She was great in Black Christmas and Sisters.  I may have to bust out Black Christmas in her honor, but it feels strange watching that movie in the middle of this heat. 

I hope we can get Sisters on blu-ray, sooner than later.  All De Palma should be on blu.&&She just did an interview with a local podcast since she was coming to Motor City Comic Con: https://drewandmikepodcast.com/drew-and-mike-may-9-2018/

She was very fucked up in the interview. Still a bummer.&&The 1978 Donner Superman film is one of the finest films ever made.  An absolute masterpiece.  Margot Kidder was a huge part of it.  I think a lot of people miss how nuanced her portrayal of Lois Lane really was.  

&&This sucks.

While I have no personal knowledge of her work other than Superman, it is with a fond memory. I saw both 1 and 2 in the theater.

RIP Margot.&&Wow. Sad. This is the first time the death of an older celebrity made me feel old. I’m 45. &&It's almost a daily reminder now of how long ago the 80s were. &&Aww. Her Lois Lane was and will probably always be my favorite version. &&I didn't see Superman until I was probably in my late teens, early 20s, so she was never Lois Lane to me. She was Juliet, or Barb from Black Christmas. Black Christmas was my real introduction to her as a horror loving 12 year old and it's always been one of my favorites from her. She plays the lush sorority sister bitch to perfection.

Had a big ol' fuckin crush on her for years. What a gorgeous woman, and super talented as an actress. Bummed to hear this. Rest in Peace. &&Such an amazing woman behind the tabloids crap. God bless you Margot!&&RIP. A loss for the world.&&Awwww what! RIP Margot.&&I loved her part in those movies. She did a wonderful job.&&Good night, Ms. Lane.&&May God rest her soul.   It is so hard to be an actress or celebrity in this day of social media madness.  I don't know how they live in the constant fish bowl that they do wout cracking up.&&Sad to hear. Loved her as Lois. I remember being a kid and watching Superman on VHS and just thinking she was so pretty. She was great in Black Christmas as well, one of my favorite slasher films.&&...so this year will be harvesting Canadians?&&Did anyone else notice the article mentions 12 year old Margot was influenced to leave Canada and start a a career in acting after seeing ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and that's what Lois says in Superman II when she jumps in the river?&&I remember watching Black Christmas when i was a little kid and it scared the shit outta me still my favorite horror movie. also Superman was a huge part of my childhood.

RIP Margot&&Fun fact:  there is a street named Lois Lane in Yellowknife, her home town.&&I want to die at 69.&&She looks like Monica from friends&&Sad to see such an iconic actress leave this world.&& those superman movies were my childhood&&*nice*&&That’s unfortunate...also...nice&&The GOAT Lois Lane, rest in peace&&R.I.P Margot. 

Lois and superman have been reunited . As a child of loved the orginal film's and was one the reasons superman is my favourite hero and the reason my reed is my favourite superman .&&AWWW Now Clark and Lois are in heaven. &&In 2000 she appeared in the Christian movie *Apocalypse 3: Tribulation*.

>  I was broke, so I needed the money. These people offered me a bunch of money to go to Toronto for a few days, and then suddenly this big limousine pulls up, and out walks this guy with about nine tons of hair, like [disgraced Illinois governor Rod] Blagojevich, but white-haired. And I said, “Who’s that?” “Oh,” say the producers, “that’s pastor such and such and such and such, and he gets a part in the movie, ’cause he sells them in his church.” And Howie and I went “What?” And then the penny dropped. It was like, “Oh my God.” And I said, “Wait a minute, what happens to my character?” And they went “Well, straight up in the Rapture.” And I went “The what?” And they explained the Rapture and the end times to me, and I went “Oh shit. I’m in one of these movies.” And I was with Howie, I believe. So that was pretty funny. I went “Oh my God, the joke’s on me here.” And I still get stopped by those freaky fundamentalists going “Oh, I’m so glad you did Tribulation.” And I wanna go, “Don’t count me into your group, honeybuns. I’m not one of you.”

I heard somewhere that she also disagreed with the treatment of mental illness in the film, but I can't find a source for that. It would make sense, considering how psychiatric medicine has helped her.&&Always back up your files, kids. &&I always found the Family Guy joke about this to be utterly tasteless and cruel.  That moment really lowered my already dim estimation of Seth MacFarlane. &&[deleted]&&She was a strong writer.

Many of the people praising Margo Kidder today were very recently accusing her of still being mentally ill to gaslight her and cast doubt on her writing. They will all be shedding pious crocodile tears at the memorial service I’m sure. &&I wonder how bad the virus could have been. Isn't wasn't like there where cryptolockers back then and while the operating system was damaged, I'm sure it was possible back then to mount the hard drive anyway and copy over the files.

Also fuck Seth Mcfarlane for his tasteless joke about her on family guy.&&Here's a weird thing - I was listening to NPR a few months ago and one of the guests was Margaret Sinclair, the mother of Justin Trudeau. She was on there talking about bipolar disorder, it was interesting.

Her Lois (at least her Richard Donner Lois) was smart and one tough cookie.&&[deleted]&&Just about to put that scene on. One of my favorites. Sad day today.&&His little half-laugh at her question is the icing on a wonderful, wonderful cake.

It was a different time and all that, but I think Superman worked so well maybe primarily because of her.  She was the surrogate for the viewer.  Skeptical and inquiring, but still amazed by what she was seeing.  She let the moviegoer feel it was okay to feel real things in a fantasy movie.  

&&She's definitely Lois for a lot of Gen X'ers. 

And Roger Moore will always be James Bond.&&>the definitive Lois Lane

Well it was certainly never going to be Bosworth or Adams, I'll tell you that much.&&The film doesn't work without her. Clark Kent would come off as too old fashioned if he didn't win over Lois. She represented the modern world. She wasn't just ""Superman's girlfriend"". She was a modern woman who excelled at her career and didn't take shit from anyone. Her falling for him, and making it believable, is how the audience falls for him.              

The modern films just treat Lois like a prop. She made Lois essential. &&Me too. I just haven't bought anyone else as Lois Lane, ever. She was attractive but not too pretty, smart, opinionated, damn good at her job, obsessed with doing good work, and still found time to indulge in a crush on Superman. &&She will always be The Lois Lane to me. RIP, Margot...&&[deleted]&&Reeve*

Coincidentally, George Reeves was the original TV Superman, tho. &&He wasn't reversing the spin of the earth, he was going backwards in time, I think?

edit: to be clear, neither option makes any sense, but going faster than the speed of light and somehow going back in time holds a bit more sci-fi credibility than turning the earth backwards to reverse time.  That ones doesn't pass the test in a couple of obvious ways, one, how would spinning in space around the earth do anything? and two if it did manage to stop the rotation of the earth and reverse it, how would that do anything?&&You try surviving a horse made of Kryptonite.&&[deleted]&&It's the best superhero theme.

Great flick (original not the Donner cut).&&I get trying to update/modernize Superman, but that was one of the biggest mistakes the DCEU and Man of Steel made, imo.
That music *is* Superman.
You hear that theme and you *feel* like you’re seeing Superman, I can’t explain it.
I feel nothing from the (I think) Hanz Zimmer MoS soundtrack.&&“They took one of the best American actresses around, Amy Adams, and didn’t give her anything to do! I mean, how stupid is that?”&&She did it all. She was great when it came to the dramatic scenes, but personally I also really enjoyed Superman II/III when they threw a little more comedy in the mix... she always did a great job with it.

Like that bit where Clark/Superman is doing the classic *being in two places at once* routine, trying to juggle a date with Lois. She never seemed clueless, because she always had just the right amount of skepticism.&&Erica Durance was great as well&&I always felt like Courtney Cox would have made a good Lois.  She was in the same ballpark for the Scream movies.  In Scream 3 she pretty much looked exactly like her.&&I would’ve thought Courtney Cox would’ve been the sure choice for Lois Lane in Superman Returns.

I go to a ton of cons and you can tell when someone is there for the fans or not.  I remember being very impressed with her.  She was educating, not just answering.   &&Saw her at a local screening of the original and she talked about how her and Christopher would be strapped in harness for the flying scenes for hours at a time; she’d even have a book to pass the time.

RIP, you had a great warm smile&&If you want to hear Margot Kidder tell some great stories check out this documentary:

Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex, Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood

It is on youtube.&&A few about Reeve; how gracious, funny and helpful he was. Stories about her upbringing and the trials and tribulations she had to endure. Various topics, she would talk with anyone. &&I met Margot about four years ago at the last Monsterpalooza convention held in Burbank and told her how I, like many of her fans, grew up watching her and Chris as a child and they defined my image of heroes, men and women and so many other things. I thankfully we were also able to share our mutual love of living in Montana (I grew up there and she lived there for much of her life - it’s always good to have something real to talk about aside from just “I’m a fan”). For the short time we chatted I found her to be so genuine, candid and kind. I am SO glad I go over my nervousness and went and talked to her (I almost chickened out twice). She was one of those amazing exceptions to the “don’t meet your heroes” rule that everyone talks about. She felt like an aunt or a neighbor that you are friends with. I’m so saddened to hear of her passing but I’m so glad I got to meet her and see that she had obviously gotten back to a better clearer place in her life. She was amazing! &&I wore a flannel shirt to a comiccon with a Superman shirt underneath and she didn't notice until she signed the picture. She called me a trailer park boy. THAT memory will always be the top one whenever I watch Superman.&&We met her at Dragon Con in Atlanta. The husband was a little star struck, and then she started to flirt with him. I can't remember what all she said, but I do remember that she thought he was Samoan (he's Mexican but gets confused with other ethnicities all the time). I've never seen him more tounge tied and happy at the same time.&&How did you get so much karma for only be active a month?&&she fucked everyone. &&> Roger Moore will always be James Bond 

I'm Gen X and you're the first person I've ever heard putting Roger at the top of the list.&&Can't believe I didn't see that before. Clark / Superman is straight out of the 50s where the chain-smoking Lois was thoroughly of the modern era. No other portrayal has come close to matching that one. Great catch.&&Wholeheartedly agree.

I also liked John Byrne's reinvention of her in his Man of Steel limited series. 

Superman made me believe a man can fly but Kidder showed me why he loved her.&&> The modern films just treat Lois like a prop.

The Snyder movies take a massive shit on the character of Lois Lane. It pisses me off how she is just inexplicably everywhere at once, at the most convenient times. Like for example, after Superman saves her from falling from that building in BvS she just magically flies a fucking helicopter over to where Batman and Superman are fighting. Like, how the fuck did she know they were there lol.

It feels like her whole purpose in these films revolve around either being a damsel in distress for Superman to save, or conveniently and inexplicably being in the right place at the right time to somehow lend a helping hand to Superman. She's also possibly the most one note Lois Lane to ever exist in live action and just never seems to have a fleshed out character arc in any of the films.&&This is an incredibly astute observation. Now I need to find the right conversation in which to pass it off as my own.&&That was fantastic. Never have truer words been spoken.&&Well, 4 was far and away the worst.  3 wasn't great either.&&Then why did he have to re-start it in the correct direction before flying back down to the surface?&&Then why did he spin around the earth until it went backwards, and then reverse and spin it forwards again?

That by reversing the spin of the earth, that time would then also go backwards. &&Hmm, that would make more sense, wouldn't it? But I know I've heard other people think he was reversing the spin of the earth too, because everyone was like ""that's not how time works"".&&You are thinking of

https://xkcd.com/162/&&Correct. The film communicates this idea by having the Earth rotate the other way, which many people saw as him reversing time by reversing the Earth &&[deleted]&&Even Hanz Zimmer knew that, hence why MOS theme is 100% compatible with it.&&[deleted]&&It's so melodic. I learned to play it on the piano when I was a kid. My favourite score of all time closely followed by Jurassic park&&I would say that the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve Superman movies are the grandfather of all the current Superhero genre.   The stuff done in Superman and Superman II gave proved there was a there there.  That lead to the 1989 Batman and that lead to a bunch of sequels.... and while they may have generally been so-so, they made money.  And that lead to X-men and then to the Nolan Batman and then the MCU.  

The whole superhero genre as we know it owes it's existence to the 1978 Superman.  It's a great movie.  Great soundtrack.  A little campy, but takes itself seriously enough too. 

Now we get 4-6 major super hero movies a year.   This year there are three MCU movies, and three others: Deadpool2, Venom, and Aquaman.  Then Dark Phoenix coming in Feb of 2019. 

in the past, we got Superman n 1979.  Superman II in 1980, and then some really bad movies while we batched that franchise burn itself  to the ground.  Then Batman in 1989.  And then a several bad squeals, but they didn't lose money.   But it was basically one franchise to a decade then. 

Now the major problem is how does Disney bring in X-men and the others into the MCU, if at all.   And we have how many Superhero TV shows.... somewhere around a dozen major ones.  

We are living in the golden age of the Super hero movie and TV shows.   Take it out to generalized Science Fiction/Fantasy, and we could add in a lot of other things too.   &&[deleted]&&Wouldn't Donner be the ""original"" since it was nearly done when he was fired?

The show was hit and miss--and when it missed, it missed *badly*--but she was a highlight. She had the right amount of balls and sweetness, the toughness, the sometimes-foolish confidence. &&Better than scum bag Mack that's for sure.&&> I always felt like Courtney Cox would have made a good Lois.        
      
Her role in the He-Man movie is pretty much her version of Lois Lane.

They were like ""well, the church gets a cut to do good things with"". I was like ""yeah, I'm sure the ancient church did, too"" and they shut up but didn't change.&&Half the reason Christian movies are so successful is that they're sold/shown at churches. 

Yes, they generally have pretty low budgets, but they're not *abnormally* low when you compare them to some of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood (*Get Out*, *Whiplash* etc). 

When the genre arrived in the 1970s with the *Thief in the Night* series (all four of them are on Vimeo if you can stomach them; I suggest you don't try), they were shown *exclusively* in churches.

Plus, with Christian movies the rapture is never far away, and that isn't the Jesus of the Gospels. That's white-haired, sword-mouthed Jesus from *Revelation*. And that guy has pet locusts.  &&[deleted]&&I am Christian and my eyes roll so hard I almost pass out everytime I see a church or religious site with an ATM.

I don’t know where you live but I’m incredibly thankful that mental health is being taking way more seriously these days. Pseudoscience doesn’t seem at all to be a factor.

On a certain level perhaps we're over-prescribing a lot of the drugs that are being used, but from personal experience a psychiatrist/therapist in connection with drugs she prescribed me helped save my marriage and my life is incredibly better since I started seeing her a few years ago.&&That's a dangerous comment. Neurology, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, and neuropsychology are FAR from pseudo-sciences. All of these specialties employ various techniques and treatments with empirical evidence supporting their efficacy. I've seen patients literally snatched from the brink of harming themselves and others by such treatments.

With a persistent and insidious stigma in the perception and treatment of mental illness, I'd be more careful bandying about terms that would dissuade anyone from seeking potentially life-saving treatment. &&*Star Wars Ep.

I smile back every time and get a little teary eyed.&&They were filming I and II at the same time and shot 75% of the footage for II when they stopped filming II to focus on I, after which Donner was replaced.

Henry Cavil is literally doing better than any prior Superman actor, which has usually been so bad as to be called a curse:

* George Reeves died under weird circumstances.
* Christopher Reeve had a horse accident. 
* Dean Cain's career died outside of fundamentalist Christian movies like God's Not Dead and various cameos he got because of being Superman, such as his role on Supergirl.
* Ben Afleck wore the costume for some movie, and then got cast as Batman and had severe alcoholsim (ok, this one is more of a stretch.)

Meanwhile, Cavil had one role of note prior to Man of Steel (a recurring, popular role in the Tudors) and has been in several movies since, including one where his billing is second only to *Tom freaking Cruise.* 

As far as I'm aware, no one's career, save maybe some execs responsible for bungling Justice league, and probably not them, have been harmed by the DC EU.

It’s all in the frame of Stand By Me, the end features narration of the four boys futures. In the film the Chris Chambers(River Phoenix) character dies breaking up a fight. In Family Guy he ODs in front of The Viper Room, then they say “and now we’re left with a hare-lipped reminder of what could’ve been”.

Then at the end of the episode they address Joaquin directly, saying “if you’re still watching, you’re a good sport and can be our friend”.

After one of these supposed punchlines they show a pic of a disheveled Joaquin with some kind of Benny Hill horn analogue. 

&&TLDR; He ridiculed Phoenix for being a lessor survivor of his late brother, River. A cruel sibling death reminder.&&It's when Fawkes brought the Sorting Hat with the Sword of Gryffindor.&&Your friend still sucks at patient confidentiality.

That would have been something, but I guess they made the right decision otherwise fewer people would have gone to watch it&&I prefer that one actually.&&John Williams was working on The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark, so understandably, he had a scheduling conflict.

Also, Ken Thorne is a legend in his own right and was Richard Lester's go-to composer, so understandably, he got the job, but he was commissioned only to write a score based on William's previous score.&&[deleted]&&3 was.. just...ewww. And it could have been good, the evil superman idea was great and Reeves pulled that off amazingly. 

But the rest... gawd. &&II had its flaws, but I wouldn’t say that it sucked. Terrence Stamp as Zod was worth the price of admission. &&Not if you have no money. &&I met Rob Paulson (voice actor, carl weezer, yacko Warner, etc..) a few years back during my first NYCC trip at a free ninja turtles autograph signing.

He was smiling, letting me record him doing the voice and kept referring to me of my name. At the end he put his hand out and said how it was nice meeting me, as I shook his hand. I gained a lot of respect for him that day. 
Don’t know if that answered your question, but a person would generally be happy and take time talking to fans at a con, close to my story. :)&&Yeah, Reeves is the actor that played Superman, and whose name is not to be confused with Reeve.&&Or ""candid""?&&It ain’t all about you sweetheart &&hi, I was professionally involved in the Broadway world back then (business side of things); and it was enjoyable spending time with talented and artistic people.

""Oh let's just have 'em throw it in the water who cares. The scene will look good.""

I mean he had Batman build a spear instead of a gun or something more practical for biblical allegory lmao. It's the lance of Longinus.

If Mystery Science Theatre 3000 comes back for another season, it needs to secure the rights to riff on this delicious trainwreck.

&&My favorite HDTGM episode is still “Hard Ticket to Hawaii.”&&[deleted]&&This is the obvious answer. When are people going to understand that time travel works exactly the same as VCRs with old beta max and VHS tapes&&This movie is how old and we're still having this argument?&&> “It’s been an incredible experience – almost like having Chris spin the Earth backward, hurtling us back in time to finish a film I loved, as did Chris. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I have enjoyed seeing ‘Superman II’ restored as it was originally conceived and intended to be seen,” Donner added.

&&Right.  I was confused by it for years.  My headcanon now is that he needed a way to travel faster than the speed of light while also, you know, not ending up several light-minutes away from Earth, which he would have done if he had traveled in a straight line.  Instead he circled the globe several times so he remained in the general proximity of where he needed to be after he turned back time.


If you can suspend your disbelief about the mechanics of time travel then it was actually logically sound of him to travel around the Earth that way.  However, like you said, from a visual storytelling perspective it was confusing because most people switched cause and effect in their heads, assuming that the movie implied Earth Spins Backward = Time Travel.  This is not helped by the fact that he actually spins a few times in the opposite direction as though he's ""restarting"" the correct spin of the Earth.  This raises the possibility that this is what the writers actually intended, which would be unfortunate.&&This is something that a person on the internet came up with - the filmmakers were much more naive than that. As Richard Donner himself said at a screening of his cut of Superman II:

> “It’s been an incredible experience – almost like having Chris spin the Earth backward, hurtling us back in time to finish a film I loved, as did Chris. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I have enjoyed seeing ‘Superman II’ restored as it was originally conceived and intended to be seen,” Donner added.&&Stop!

It's certainly been good for Gal Gadot. Not that the F&F movies weren't a big deal, but playing Wonder Woman has won her worldwide acclaim. &&> Ben Afleck wore the costume for some movie

He was literally playing the first guy on your list. 

&&Let's totally ignore the guy who has been superman and went on to become the atom in multiple DC tv shows.&&I think some of it has to do with the general acknowledgement that all the actors chosen to play these iconic characters are all really genuinely good choices.

It was fun to see all the extra scenes though, especially with the Krypton guard.&&No no I liked that Saran Wrap S out of nowhere which made perfect sense and wasn’t stupid. &&[Donner cut ending ](https://youtu.be/rHvag4O8FZk) &&Ouch&&Any cool stories you can share?

&&He's a boy scout, like Superman in Iron Man's outfit.&&In all honesty, if you go back and watch Batman Forever and Batman & Robin as a 90’s take on the 70’s Batman it’s actually fairly entertaining. I think coming on the heels of Burton’s Batman and how dark it was hurt it initially. Although yea, the nipples didn’t help. &&And he’s a wonderful Atom. &&Yeah he was a great superman. The movie was boring though.&&The script was the problem, but I was also very underwhelmed by Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  There just wasn't anything there.&&He was incorrigible.&&nice&&nice&&Wow, you got to be a big person to say ""you're a good person"" to your attempted rapist. Much respect.&&*Speechcraft increased to 100*&&Apparently the crazy, talking to herself, shopping cart pushing homeless woman is act a lot of homeless women put on to help prevent from being raped. &&""These thumb drives will protect you from rape. do you want the 1 gig or the 4 Gig?""&&""how'd you get these crazy viruses on your computer?""

""I dunno. I just used the random thumb drive my cyber security teacher gave all of us.""&&Disgusting.&&I like Tessmacher Peaks.&&No. &&I actually really liked Batman Forever as a kid. Nicole Kidman was so fine in that. My sister, and I watched it 100 times. &&Can't deny that. Would've better better if they had more Lois/Clark interaction (without the weird kid) and more action. &&I think he was an absolutely perfect Clark Kent. He was a meh Superman.&&Yes. But he doesn't know the meaning of the word.

(He really doesn't) &&nice&&nice&&""you're a good person"" is shorthand for ""you're a good person at heart"".

She's appealing to the persons good nature, not literally affirming the person as good.

It's not about flattering the person.  It's about him thinking he's a good person.&&Any lame stories you can share?&&His voice and mannerisms as Clark Kent were like a very good impression of Christopher Reeve. That part worked well. But he was too young looking and lean for Superman and didn't have the gravitas for the part. Well, Bryan Singer definitely has a type.&&nice&&",2018-05-14 12:59:29
