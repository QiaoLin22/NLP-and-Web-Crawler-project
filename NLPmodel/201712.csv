"Why Everybody Should Be Very Afraid of the Disney Death Star: “Disney would control as much as 40 percent of the the U.S. movie business, and 40 percent of the U.S. television business”",96597,7k0uie,https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/disney-21st-century-fox/548492/,7013,1513356115.0,,"If anyone wants an example of why cross-media ownership is dangerous, here's one:

TL;DR ... Disney made subsidiary ABC kill a story about pedophiles working at its parks. &&The great Disney Google War of 2026&&I heard on a podcast (Storm of Spoilers actually) them discussing the deal and how in the novel Cloud Atlas (I've seen the movie, never read the book) movies in the future are all called Disneys, because Disney owns all entertainment. Seems like that is a little too close on the nose now. &&I expect movie theaters and cable/satellite providers to feel a lot of pressure. Disney has a lot of leverage for increasing what they charge. I'm prepared for prices to rise&&Now, witness the power of this fully-operational oligopoly!&&I heard a rumor that Disney is in talks to buy the rights to mars, so they can have a literal Disney world.

However, I also started the rumor.&&Good ... Good ... let the hate flow through you. 

- Emperor Mouse&&I remember when there were only 3 TV networks. Showing a repeat of *Gone With the Wind* was a big deal back then.
&&Waiting for them to execute order 66&&So now Disney essentially dictates pretty much all media that any person from 0-18 sees, right?&&I’m just shook at the fact that the same people who own Frozen and Moana also own Alien and Predator now.&&What was the whole deal about a few months ago? That Disney was forcing all theaters showing Last Jedi to keep it in theaters for two months and on their biggest screens, or else they don't get to show it at all? AND that they keep like 70% of ticket sales? Now Disney can pull even more of this shit. &&They should start an ISP and then throttle their content on other providers. &&Kind of ironic this is mentioned yet the fact that most of mass media is owned by a select few companies is not known by many people. The majority of main stream news is controlled by a few corporations. That should be a cause of concern yet I don't see it mentioned that often.

&&You should look at how they treat their Disney Junior talent if you want any indication of their ruthlessness. The titular star of Doc McStuffins was hired and fired for every recording session over the two and half that she she worked for them.&&How ironic would it be if they became the empire.&&Pretty soon, it will just be Amazon, Disney, and Google.

Oh, and probably GE, too.

What are you guys planning for the corporation-controlled dystopian future?&&And i'm sure with what happened yesterday the internet is going to be included in this somehow. &&What, movies are going to get shittier, or ticket prices are going to get more expensive?

Frankly, anything that drives people away from Hollywood is probably a good thing.

You know, the more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers, and all that....&&Also, Fox now has $50 billion to dump into their news organization. 

Edit: My dumb baby brain now better understands the terms of the deal. Stocks really more than some walking around cash. Thanks for the replies!&&[deleted]&&hm makes a lot more sense why Disney would want to leave netflix.&&Please Lucas save us! We didn't really hate you. We just didn't like the fart jokes and endless string of lame meetings. 

&&There is a crossover comic where Vader fights the Aliens and its fucking awesome.&&There's an easy fix: restore the public domain.

Copyright should end after thirty years. No exceptions. 99% of works have made all the money they're ever going to. The remaining few are ingrained in the culture of a generation, and nobody owns culture. 

Media giants that can create new grand works are perfectly acceptable - but they cannot hold half our popular history hostage. Copyright is a convenient fiction with the explicit intent to incentivize new works. It is a gift from the public. Disney in particular has perverted that, as though Walt may yet rise from his grave and draw more cartoons. 

Put it this way: if George Lucas had built actual working lightsabers, his patent would've expired twenty years ago. The idea that anyone still owns the concept of laser-swords is a fucking joke. They are as common to our imagination as flying horses or the walking dead. The rest of the ""accidental masterpiece"" belongs to us all in the same way - whether or not the law reflects that right.&&What could go wrong? They're such a consumer champion in regards to IP! (/s obviously)&&I mean it’s a small world after all.&&Might be a dumb question. Wouldn't that just create a monopoly? How can they own so much?&&I’m glad people are acknowledging how scary this is. Yesterday I was seeing a whole lot of “net neutrality is gone but at least the avengers will have X-men now”, and it bummed me out. Both the Disney acquisition and net neutrality repeal are giving more power to corporations whose primary function is to make more money from you. Just because one means you get to see fun superhero cameos doesn’t mean it isn’t insidious and/or dangerous.&&>When Mufasa tells Simba in *The Lion King* that “everything the light touches is our kingdom,” it isn’t just memorable screenwriting. It is corporate guidance.

Holy shit.&&Monopolism has never been good for entertainment.  During the days of the Studio System, when a handful controlled everything, movies were usually crap - generic, boring, formulaic crap, and censored all to hell because it was so easy for politicians to pressure a monolithic institution.

The same was true of television when there were only three channels.  Quality exploded with the number of channels, but then declined again as their ownership consolidated.  Then came streaming and we get high quality again, but then the same cycles appear to be repeating.





&&""Death Star"" is a copywrited term owned by the Disney Corporation. Please cease and desist all unauthorized usage.&&What's wrong with Mickey mouse sitting on the iron throne? &&Pssshhhh! I've got a kid, Disney already controls 85% of the content we watch!!&&People need to realize the landscape is changing. Content providers are getting into bed with big telecom. NBC Universal is now part of Comcast, Warner and AT&T are going through the motions etc...

Disney is trying to avoid that by increasing their content and going direct to consumer. 

Honestly, I'm more ok with Disney owning more content than the companies who own the content and distribution channel.&&I mean movies aren't putting water in my cup or food on the plate. ""Afraid"" no. ""Annoyed"" yes. &&This is why I fear any political party that has a good relationship with a news outlet&&You guys know this book is like PACKED with insanely homophobic preachy lies where he accuses Disney Parks of being Gay havens where men make out and wear flamboyant clothing.

Nobody thinks about little old Disney that makes cute movies from our childhood, but they've been aggressive in lobbying to make copyright more draconian and just generally screwing over progressive free speech legislation.  They're not a nice company.  &&People are just memeing about crossovers but this is really not great.&&Disney Vs SpaceX

Although there are a couple of missing steps, probably.  I'd probably expect them to buy an island nation first, then a continent.   Then mars.&&Ha-ha&&Can't wait for Adult Swim to pick on that.

&&Yep, which is why they froze the user review of The Last Jidi an hour ago. They own us now.&&Already did it, it's called ""Lilo and Stitch""&&Crossover confirmed!&&I mean, this has been the norm for a while.

Worth keeping in mind, but they aren't quite the same type of evil with nearly as much reach&&Well yeah, Fox owned part of Hulu, which is partially owned by Time Warner Cable, so I'd imagine (if repealing NN is evil) that TWC will make it easy with no extra cost to stream HD Hulu, and might be keen on throttling and charging for unrestricted access to Prime / Netflix.

EDIT: Lots of responses and questions here! 
 Honestly I was just talking out of my ass and regurgitating shit I hear elsewhere to argue with people.  No clue if any of it was true lmao&&The video game industry went through and Indie revolution over the last decade. Why not the movie industry?&&Well least the Disney theme parks may be interesting but sadly I cant afford it regardless. &&> What, movies are going to get shittier, or ticket prices are going to get more expensive?

Whynotboth.jpg&&Makes you wonder how many pedophiles and rapists are working for Disney&&Not necessarily...

> agreement for Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios, along with cable and international TV businesses, for approximately $52.4 billion in stock (subject to adjustment)

My understanding is that no cash is exchanging hands in this deal. Disney also take on $13.7billion in debt from Fox.

My question is - How much of Disney will Rupert Murdoch own?
&&Kinda. It was an all-stock deal. If they tried to liquidate the $50b they'd tank the stock. But your scary point remains. This has made NewsCorp much more nimble.&&Probably to buy more papers and radio stations, fuck News Corp and the destruction they’ve brought to the English speaking world.&&They pretty much own Hulu.  Netflix is their competition.&&Well it made sense even before the acquisition. Disney started its own streaming service. No need for Netflix.&&No we just hate all the terrible dialog. George, imagine worlds and let someone else do the talking.&&star wars *and x-men in the mcu! it is just as Patton Oswald foretold!&&> The idea that anyone still owns the concept of laser-swords is a fucking joke. 

A bad one, considering that's not how copyright works.  You can have all the laser-swords all you want.  You just can't use Luke Skywalker without permission.&&I really think we should propose a deal: Disney gets exclusive right to all IP related to Mickey Mouse for eternity, and in exchange, they stop any lobbying whatsoever related to our IP laws. If they break their part of the deal, the Mouse becomes public domain immediately. 

Then everyone gets what they want and we can go back to reasonable public domain laws. &&No it won't create a monopoly yet, the market can be described as an oligopoly which is the second worst form of markets.

(From Wikipedia) an oligopoly is a market form wherein a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. Oligopoly has its own market structure.&&The Department of Justice has to approve this merge, if they think it would place a burden on trade and reduce competition it wouldn't be allowed&&He's supposed to be helping Sora and Riku defeat Xehanort, that's what's wrong.&&[deleted]&&Any corporation that huge and rich is going to pull a lot of weight in writing laws to its benefit and at the peoples' expense.&&Especially without any concept of fairness or truth in reporting accountability.

As a lover of going to AMC theatres, boo!&&The studios were already separated from the exhibitors in the early days of movies, so there's precedent for breaking up that kind of monopoly. Also, AMC is owned by a giant Chinese conglomerate who would be very unlikely to sell. Regal is about to merge with a European exhibitor, but Cinemark is small and alone. Disney could snap them up and not notice. &&What happened with the LA Times?&&Woah, what's going on with that? Those couldn't be legit user reviews could they?&&I have a friend who lives in Los Angeles and reviews films (among other things. He works freelance.) He was invited to this neat weekend Disney was putting on, celebrating the Marvel films. It was to be twenty or so reviewers/film beat writers. They would get a nice dinner the second day, see some in-production projects, etc. (They then write those pieces you see every so often, on set visits and preview articles.) Batman V Superman came out, and this guy gave it a good score. Actually, a better score than the last Marvel film he reviewed. (I know, he was one of the few to give BvS a good score.) Disney sent him an email saying they had invited too many people, and his invitation was revoked. It was the day after his BvS review was posted on the site he had written it for. He emailed and whoever he spoke to was forthright in saying they disagreed with his assessment of BvS being better than their last movie and wanted to give his spot to someone who would appreciate it more.(So not even their first excuse, too many people, but just straight up you can't come if you review the competition better than us.) This is the kind of stuff that goes on with these businesses, and Disney is the worst of them! Everything is bought and paid for!&&What in the hell?

While you're all pissed at the cable/dish company, Disney is laughing with a clean reputation. &&Whenever I bring this up Disney/Marvel fanboys just shrug. It’s pretty much the definition of desiring entertainment more than freedom.&&As Harlan Ellison warned, “Don’t fuck with the mouse.”&&Imagine the crossovers we could have had if Disney hadn't been so successful in destroying limits on copyrights. Anyone could use Mickey Mouse and Superman and Spider-man together if they wanted.

People die, we live and then new world order happens, we question where our hover cars are. Comcast comes out with the truth but requires a new hover car net package and only limited to non-plebs of the 20th century.

A robot uprising happens. But you don't want to know what happens then. After being programmed by an endless watch of I-Robot and maybe men in black we then get crushed in to cubes. While we sit in the parkinglot of the cube galley, we all ask where we went wrong.

I'll tell you roswell 1945 fucked us all over. A sink hole opens and everything gets swallowed to which we get uncubed l or you lot get slapped with collars by a race of some sort who felt sorry for us. And we all get castrated.

What else do they own...??&&Thankfully the EU has at least some semblance of net neutrality, it isn't perfect, and the US had a better one until yesterday&&Which is covered in net neutrality&&*Clever mouse.*&&My friend did an internship at Disney in Orlando. Saw it as a way to advance her hospitality resume.

She worked as a greeter at a restaurant in the park. As in her entire job was saying hi to families and taking them to their table and then sitting and waiting for the next one.

She had no transportation, and therefore had to do all activities and eat almost exclusively through the park. Due to her wages, and the sheer ridiculousness of park pricing, she left the internship almost completely broke. Her housing for her and fellow interns was basically 3rd tier community college dorms (paraphrasing her words). 

Speaking out against well... really anything about your situation or Disney in general would ensure you didn't advance in the company past that level. That's basically because all her fellow employees were cutthroat motherfuckers that would turn on people simply to show their loyalty to the company and shoot down others' chances.


She said that you basically had the option to subject yourself to these degrading conditions for a couple years to maybe advance a few rungs in the hospitality ladder, which help explains the vicious atmosphere between employees. 

I wish I was making all this up, and yes, this is a secondhand retelling, but she stood by everything, and said she's terrified of anyone who's subjected themselves to that corporate attitude for so long as to actually rise to the top.

Anyways I got carried away, but yeah Disney ain't so cuddly once you peel away the surface.&&He's saying that Disney is a ruthless company that treats their younger talent very poorly, and that should give an indication of how they will potentially treat the rest of their talent as their reach expands. The example given is that a voice actress for a popular show doesn't have an ongoing contract, but is essentially hired only for the time in takes to do a recording sessions, probably to avoid paying the costs normally associated with an actual employee and to keep the actress dangling.

I have no insight into how much of that is actually true though.&&It's actually Two Death Stars cresting the horizon of Earth.&&Time to grow a pink Mohawk.&&Eh. Hopefully that. But if we start making leaps and bounds toward the Eclipse Phase route, I'm getting the fuck off earth. &&Dibs on being the dragon who rules the Underworld&&Decker life. &&Buckle up, chummer.&&They also own AT&T broadband,  a ton of cable channels like Golf Channel, Bravo, USA, Syfy, Oxygen, E!, MLB/NHL Network...&&Oh snap!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_General_Electric&&Time Warner Cable was spun off from Time Warner and TWC was purchased by Charter Communications in 2016.

So Time Warner doesn't have a stake in the ISP side anymore. While Comcast has a 30% stake in Hulu.

Time Warner also only has a 10% stake in Hulu, with Disney and Fox having 30% each, but with this buyout, Disney will have a 60% majority share over Hulu.&&Distribution. Indies need to sell to Netflix, Amazon or Disney if they want people to discover their work. As Amazon and Netflix get more popular, they’re going to want bigger budgets and bigger attached names before they buy content, which blocks out a lot of indies. 

Going through a smaller paid distribution service (Vimeo, for example) is possible, but then they’d need an even larger marketing budget to get the eyeballs. 

Festivals are cool, but jumping from success there to commercial success is like winning the lottery.

Fortunately [Disney folded and reversed their decision due to negative press and other news papers boycotting Disney and not writing Disney reviews](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/disney-la-times.html), if there is one thing we can use to at least try to keep Disney from doing stuff like this is that Disney cares very much about their public image and they've spend decades trying to perfect it. &&They did a report on how Disney has been fucking over the city of Anaheim, by basically funneling most of the money that should go back to the city into their own pockets. (The parking garages that they use, for example, are technically owned by the city, but the city barely sees any of the money that they should from garages.) Disney was so upset by this article that they banned the LA Times from reviewer screenings of their movies, meaning that they couldn't write reviews of them. Thankfully, other news organizations stood by the LA Times in solidarity and I think they were told that their movies wouldn't be considered for Academy Awards.

(It was channel 19, but our TV only went to 13.)  And we didn't have Fox until the early nineties.&&Yeah, we were all watching pretty much the same shows as everyone else. Now, the shows I like to watch are almost all different from those of my friends and family. There is definitely overlap but there are shows that I watch now that my mom could never watch and vice versa. &&We've reached the point where Disney owns Epic Rap Battles of History.

I've seen Blade Runner, I know where we're gonna end up.&&I can confirm. Most of the youtubers I follow are part of Maker Studios, thus being ""owned"" by Disney as of this year.&&Game grumps are on Polaris. Polaris is a sub-network of maker. Maker is owned by Disney. Game grumps are owned by Disney. Fuck. &&AT&T owns Fullscreen. Disney owns Maker Studios though so they still have a big presence on YouTube.&&Correct me if I'm wrong, but Fullscreen is a subsidiary of Otter Media along with Crunchyroll.

Otter Media is joint owned by At&t and the Chernin Group. The Chernin Group had a first look deal with Fox for their films, but I dont think they were ever owned by Fox. So I dont think Disney owns Fullscreen.

You might be thinking of Maker Studios who used to be owned by Disney and was dissolved and absorbed into their new Disney Digital Network.&&They own Maker too.

Though I am not sure if its maker that owns fullscreen or fullscreen that owns maker.

But Fullscreen owns Roosterteeth, so only YT they need to capture now is Vanoss, KYRSp33dy and a few others to basically own content 0-25's see on YT.&&She's an alien predator... she caught Stitch, who is a child alien.

Edit: So many people responding about their theatre serving food. No shit.

Most of it is Applebee's quality though. 

I've been to the leather recliner chair movie theaters that serve beer to you and they still have shit quality food that they pretend is high quality. All they need to do is serve some burgers from a grill and pizza from an oven and they would do fine.&&This deal keeps getting worse all the time! &&How is being a hostess at a restaurant an internship for a resume boost? My high school friend did that as a summer job at like Applebees. Sorry I'm dumb. Help me understand.&&I've known a ton of people who did the Disney internships and came away with the exact opposite experience. My understanding is that the Disney internships usually make people become obsessed with Disney, and some cases makes them really hate it.&&I did the internship and we did have copious transportation options from our living to work. They had a fleet of 20 something buses going around wdw and even offsite. I rarely ate on site because I packed my own damn lunch and I worked at a hotel with even less options. Also where would you go besides the park, wdw is the size of a small town, you would drive 20 minutes to find something offsite and we had a 30 minute break. Also those dorms were way better than anything I had in college&&She could have packed her own fucking lunch&&Alright, this is a bit bullshit.


Your friend did a Disney College Program, and seemingly in a Table Service restaurant, where your description of her job was primarily what you said (greeting, helping with front of house in general). It's probably the one of the least exciting roles they offer, though it's far less stressful than most (especially quick service food). She couldn't be a server as the openings are incredibly rare given how much money they make from tips, with the few positions being given mostly to full-time staff.


'She had no transportation' isn't exactly accurate. They run buses from the housing complexes to every location on property, as well as places like Walmart, Publix, and the Florida mall. Most of the complexes are also a 10-15 minute walk from the same Publix the bus runs to (as well as within walking distances to some large outlets and several restaurants). If you can't be bothered to go to the grocery store and actually cook, then yeah, you'll have to budget yourself to avoid going broke given that theme park food is expensive even with staff discounts. A lot of DCP employees tend to seriously underestimate how much money they spend on alcohol (especially within the parks) and going out and complain about not having money for food.


Housing quality is mixed, with Vista Way having recently undergone a complete refurbishment as far as I'm aware. My shower was a bit screwed up but otherwise it was a nice enough place to live in for a few months (especially considering how little I was in).


It's not really something you go into with the aim of coming out with a surplus of money. It's an easy way to live for a few months given that all you have to do it catch the bus to work and all of your bills are automatically paid. If you budget yourself, you may be able to save up a bit, but the main benefit is having a bit of fun and getting Disney on your CV. 


As far as advancing, it all really depends. I know a few friends who stayed on after their programs that were supervisors within a year, which pays a decent amount more. Moving up to management without a degree isn't easy anywhere, especially at Disney given all the competition. Your best bet for getting in with that is actually finishing your degree and applying to one of their actual management programs.&&Right on dude that is proper English!&&oh, that is 100% normal for session work. You don't get a salary, you get paid by the job.&&> The example given is that a voice actress for a popular show doesn't have an ongoing contract, but is essentially hired only for the time in takes to do a recording sessions, probably to avoid paying the costs normally associated with an actual employee and to keep the actress dangling.

That how all voice actors work though.  You are paid for work performed, not as a regular employee.  You don't just get a weekly paycheck of x, you get paid per episode spent in recording.  Most TV shows have contracts for seasons, but nothing beyond that.  The actor is even suing for [breech of contract](http://deadline.com/2015/10/doc-mcstuffins-s-disney-lawsuit-kiara-muhammad-1201590285/) which indicates that her being ""hired and fired for every recording session"" is just the OP not understanding how voice acting works or is paid.&&Or time to find a black trenchcoat that fits. &&Yes. I find Comcast owning the channels and content it provides more of a problem. Down the road when Disney decides to buy an ISP to compete against Comcast, so that their content isn't throttled, I hope there is more outrage. When Comcast bought NBC/Universal it didn't feel as if many people got upset about it (at least compared to what is occurring right now with Disney). 

Edited to clean up some stray letters.&&Yeah, one of my favorite aspects of 30 Rock was how much they made fun of GE. 

I doubt the Comcast corporate censors would be so forgiving if they were the butt of so many jokes. They strike me as a rather mirthless company. 

I'm just waiting for an announcement of an Amazon and Google merger or something just as insidious. And everyone will be excited that their Alexa and Google Home will be able to work together while completely missing the larger implications.&&So does this mean Disney will use Hulu as their streaming service instead of creating a new I need to pay a sub fee for to watch MCU movies and shows?&&Then hopefully Netflix becomes the Steam of the movie world

Its not like Steam lacks big budget games&&> TL;DR: There’s no Steam store for movies.

Seems like there's a market opening there for someone.&&You really don't need a big budget for most films. You can write a script for free, you can find plenty of talented actors and actresses to fill rolls for cheap and you can even do a lot of green screen sorta cg stuff pretty cheaply. 

Not to say there isn't a ton of value in having solid funding so you can hire experienced professionals. But there's plenty of great films that were made on tiny budgets. You can't create a good modern action film on a small budget but we have plenty of those anyhow.&&Yeah, but CG will get less expensive as the cost of computing power per teraflop decreases.&&Well fuck.&&That's a sweet chunk of mouse. &&5% of the world? Deal! &&We’ve had that cunt in Britain since the 80s, the aussies even longer.&&Exactly, most people in the world have absolutely no idea what Hulu even is. Netflix on the other hand. &&If you just boil the prequel trilogy down to the plot points it's really got this amazing story of intrigue, temptation, loyalty, love, duty, betrayal, confusion, all that good stuff that makes for interesting and internally conflicted characters.  But they sucked, because nobody would give Lucas any usable input because my god, this guy brought us Star Wars, he's clearly a genius and how dare I try to impose my sense over his.&&It's a good story told really, really poorly.

We all know the best choice.  
It's the telecos. It's always been the telecos.  
Transportation and communication. Those are the two things that it's so profitable to monopolize, and which can do the most harm to society if they are monopolized.  
Frankly, the net neutrality hubbub is accelerating this course, but I'm sure everyone involved is going to make their money fast and get out before the shit they've stirred up comes home to roost.&&Notice that he's talking about Alphabet which has a much higher net worth at close to $600 billion.&&Well, sort of. They formed their own parent company as part of a big restructuring a few years ago.&&They do, but they created it themselves.&&*You are now a Moderator of /r/me_ira*&&No.  The movie jumps all over the place but the book has a Russian doll type structure - the story set furthest in the past starts the book and cuts out half way through before moving on to the next story which is also cut in half and so on.  The story set in the far future is a complete narrative in the middle before moving back into the past with the remaining halves of the other stories in reverse chronological order.

Hope that makes sense.  But trust me, the structure is easy to follow in the book.&&One of the things the movie failed to convey or utilize was the book's construction, and how it aided the storytelling. The stories are arranged like a Matryoshka doll—each story is nestled within its immediate predecessor, so it goes 1-2-3-4-5-6-5-4-3-2-1.

The result is a feeling like the fall of a rollercoaster throughout the whole second half of the book, as you continue going deeper and deeper into each story as the previous protagonist experiences it for themselves.

&&I do look good in mirrorshades.&&I'd imagine they'll want to use the Hulu technology to quickly launch their own to generate more income, if they can legally do that.&&That’s only one element in the cost, the important one is man hours.

It was worse than that, I believe, people that he trusted, like Lawrence Kasdan said 'no' when Lucas came up to him prior to Phantom Menace, just to read it and evaluate it. Kasdan just said something like 'you should do your 'vision', george'.

It felt to me that Kasdan knew very well that Lucas writing would be a trainwreck and let it happen. Maybe to teach a lesson, since he got onboard on Star Wars with JJ.

Lucas called Spielberg to direct Phantom Menace, and Spielberg said something like 'star wars is your thing, george'.

Spielberg, when he has a good story, he would cut throats to get it. Directing Star Wars should be exhilarating for him, but said no.

The old school Star Wars artists didn't want to work with George again. Something gone horribly wrong in the Return of the Jedi production, because even Lucas was fed up with it. Whole teams were dismantled, he had his divorce with Marcia, which helped to develop the series, and Lucas would then only work with agreeable 'brand new talents'. He was never the same afterwards, making bland by-the-book products (Young Indiana Jones was so meh). Like he lost his edge there. 

When he tried to get the gang back together, they left him high and dry. 

The thing is, you can never build something important alone. Even if you have billions. George is probably a very difficult person.

&&He initially tried to get different directors for the prequels, for the same reason he didn't want to direct V and VI. The dude knows his limits, even the original masterpiece that is IV was saved in the editing room. But after Spielberg and Zemeckis turned down Phantom Menace and told him he should do it himself, well, he did, and this is what we got. 

Why he proceeded to direct II and III after the failure of I is beyond me. &&We know the ISP market is horrible because even the wealthiest, most powerful individuals, like Spielberg, for example, have to deal with the same bullshit internet services common people do. (Granted, it's those people's assistants who have to take care of it, but the household still needs to deal with intermittently functioning internet from the same brand some poor person in a very different zip code has to deal with.)&&Later that week.....

Don't just complain about the sequels, go see the other films, and if something is really good, tell people about it. This is happening not just in films, but also series, games, books, basically every kind of entertainment. So much money is being poured into the massive franchises that it's virtually impossible for smaller, original projects to find an audience. If you want to see more original stuff, seek it out, but also help spread the word when you find something you like.&&Is Nolan the biggest singular box office draw in Hollywood? &&This is the norm for Nolan. Same thing happened with Interstellar. &&dOeS dUnKiRk TaKe pLaCe In ThE sAmE cInTeMaTic UnIvErSe As ScHiNdLeR’s LiSt&&I've seen a lot of comments about Hollywood's originality nowadays and I always tell people the same thing - this is nothing new.  Since 1980 is as far back as I can see on IMDB, let's look at that.  16 of the top 25 were adaptations, remakes or sequels:

* Empire Strikes Back (sequel)
* Any Which Way You Can (sequel)
* Coal Miner's Daughter (adaptation of a biography)
* Smokey and the Bandit II (sequel)
* The Blue Lagoon (adaptation of a novel)
* The Blues Brothers (adaptation of characters from SNL)
* Ordinary People (adaptation of a novel)
* Popeye (adaptation of a comic strip character)
* Urban Cowboy (adaptation of an article originally published in Esquire)
* The Shining (adaptation of a novel)
* Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (sequel)
* Brubaker (adaptation of a novel)
* The Jazz Singer (remake)
* Flash Gordon (adaptation of a comic strip character)
* Lady & the Tramp (re-issue)
* The Elephant Man (adaptation of a biography)

Look at other years; you'll see similar trends.  Even if you look way back to the '30s and '40s, there were plenty of adaptations of past characters, novels and stage plays.  I know there are a lot more remakes now, but what were you supposed to remake when films barely existed?

Many films that are considered among the greatest ever fit this category - The Godfather, Raging Bull, Gone with the Wind, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, The Wizard of Oz, The Shawshank Redemption, the list goes on and on.

Edit: [Link to the list.](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980)  Also, of the 9 original films in the top 25 for 1980, 3 had later sequels (Airplane!, Caddyshack, Friday the 13th) and 2 had a spinoff TV series (9 to 5, Private Benjamin).&&I generally don't get excited by Directors, there are good ones and great ones but even they can be hit or miss.

There aren’t any adaptations that aren’t sequels or remakes in the top 25.&&You know, I am not really a Christopher Nolan fan, but I am honestly happy that a lot of people go to see his movies. Because he is making original and well made movies (that are just not my cup of tea), so it is good that he is getting this level of support from audiences that he deserves. I would much rather that 

Although I have a feeling that if I read through this comment thread I'll end up rolling my eyes so much that I'll go blind lol. &&The last time the top live-action film was totally original was 2009 (Avatar). Before that, it was 1998 (Saving Private Ryan). Interestingly enough, that was the last of three straight years of original movies winning, four if you count Toy Story (which was animated). 

BTW, the last time before *Avatar* that the top movie wasn't based on something of ANY kind (even a historical event) was 1996 with Independence Day. Before that it was 1990 with Home Alone. &&I was thinking this too. I remember seeing an almost identical post about Interstellar and/or Inception.

Edit: a word&&God I love that movie.&&One of my biggest cinematic regrets in life is not seeing that in IMAX, or in theaters in general.&&Favorite movie. Literally seen it 36 times (I keep track on snap chat). Objectively I know it’s not the best in terms of plot and writing, etc. but the cinematic style, the visuals, and the score are so incredible. &&Or Quentin Tarantino or Steven Spielberg or James Cameron.&&Good point. Warner throws $100-200m at Nolan every single time he pitches a movie.

Like, I find it funny how XXX: Return of Xander Cage, a movie in which one of the crew members is a DJ whose special skill is that he's ""fun to be around"", gets BLASTED by reddit, but those exact same posters will probably praise a movie like Planet Terror, but only because Planet Terror has the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino label of ""This is a joke, haha grindhouse, get it?"".

It's not even 100% original since it's actually inspired from a true story.&&This is what's extra hilarious to me. Dunkirk is literally a recreation of historical events but it gets credit for not being an ""adaptation"".

Why are some people so obsessed with films not being ""adaptations""? Films have been largely ""adaptations"" since the invention of film. Person writes story. People think story good. People make play of story. People think play good. People make movie of play.

Are most people truly not aware how many classic films are adaptations?

And not for nothing, *every* film is an adaptation, even if it's from a completely original script, because films have to be adapted from scripts to turn typed letters on a page into a film. No script provides 100% of the recipe for the film. Dozens of not hundreds of creators and artists have to take that script and make thousands of artistic choices all coming to together to turn a few dozen pieces of paper into a moving picture.
&&That’s true of every famous director. If Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Wes Anderson made a film under a pseudonym, we’d still know it was them. &&I'm in this boat. Watched because it was Nolan.&&Nolan is my 14-year-old's favorite director/producer/writer, and I have to say it's rubbed off on me.  I have so much respect for his (apparent) ethic of quality-over-quantity that I was very much looking forward to seeing the movie, despite the fact that I really don't enjoy war/military movies.

I was not disappointed.  Nolan has a rare talent and deserves every bit of praise he receives.&&I wanted to see it because it had spitfires in it&&I think that's a good thing.

It's good to start watching a movie because of the people behind it.&&I'm going out on a limb here and guess he's the most succesful director with more than ~~5~~ 10 movies when it comes down to average box-office gross (per movie). Please prove me wrong if this is not the case (couldn't easily find a list).

So I would definitely say he is already a franchise.

Edit: it doesn't hold up if you use the cut-off point at 5 movies, [but he is the most succesful average grossing director with at least 10 movies](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Director&sort=sumgross&p=.htm)&&Even with a 20 minute Olaf short&&Can't believe Boss Baby has made nearly the same amount as Coco&&Which is crazy because it’s, in my opinion, a top 3 Pixar film for me. &&Why did Disney not have faith in it?

I'm reslly looking forward to watching it!&&Coco is now my favorite Pixar movie. Everything about it was so well done. Can't wait to see it again.&&Is coco a remake, adaptation or sequel?

Isn't it an original as well&&That doesn't really surprise me at least with Get Out. It's pretty heavily focused on modern American race relations, and I'm not sure that would have a huge draw overseas. It stands on its own as a film apart from that context, of course, but I think the politics of it played a big role in getting people in the US to see it. &&Split is awesome though.&&Split was amazing. I really like Shyamalan's movies, even the okay ones.&&B grade chinese action movie. It's pretty bad but became the highest grossing movie of all time in China &&Looks like it's a Chinese film, 0.3% of it's takings are from the US and it still make it that high, shows how big China's box office is.

edit: changed domestic to US to avoid confusion&&That's a fair point, but including animation doesn't really help much. Boss Baby is an adaptation, Cars 3 is a sequel, and Your Name should probably be on the 2016 list instead since that's when it made most of its box office. That just leaves Coco, making the overall total two original films in the top 25.&&You could say, that literally, it was an adaptation&&also their already was existing [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_at_Dunkirk) about the dunkirk evacuation so, you could say it's a remake.&&It was an original story with fictional characters that took place during an actual event. By the same token movies like *Titanic* wouldn't be considered ""original"" either. &&Right. This is literally the fault of the consumer. Hollywood is just giving us exactly what we want.&&I pirate tons of independent and unique films, why isn't Hollywood catering to me?&&Agreed. It's still within the power of consumers to enforce change with our money and attention! Another best practice is also not to feed into the buzz of the movies you don't enjoy.

It's not a documentary.&&In the case of *Dunkirk* it's set in an historic event but it's an original story with fictional characters. How specific does it need to be? I mean *Saving Private Ryan* was set in WWII but is also about fictional characters and events. Are all war movies then considered ""based on a true story?""&&It's not the only one on the list, there's like 5 but 4 are animated.&&It was based on information from the book “Forgotten Voices of Dunkirk” and the author of the book was the film adviser.&&It was nice for some original films to make the domestic 25 tho.

Edit: There are definitely others, but it's quite rare.
&&My favourite ever scene in any movie is the spinning docking scene.

Was almost as big as Fast And Furious 7 which has Tony Jaa in it. Went to see Get Out, Arrival and Dunkirk around that time instead though. But according to the consensus in this thread, us non-Americans have shitty taste in movies because we can't speak English so I guess those movies are garbage as well.

On a more serious note: A lot of these big-ass blockbusters do well abroad because our theaters have a lot of local/European/Japanese/Korean content as well. The American films that actually end up in theaters here are mostly the MCU, Star Wars and Fast and Furious type big profile flicks. And they come with gargantuan marketing campaings.&&It also had a couple of big stars from China (Donnie Yen) and India (Deepika Padukone) which must've attracted many people from those countries. &&This. I was overseas visiting my cousins at the time and talked them into seeing Fences with me, they didn't like it at all but then went to see XXX the next week and loved it, for the rest of the time there were a lot of jokes about my ""weird"" taste in movies. I really do get it though, if your English is limited a bad action movie is always gonna beat out a good drama.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of the same responses so let me be clear, my cousins understand segregation and American racism, this was not about not understanding American culture this was about not liking movies with more dialogue than action when the dialogue isn't in your first language. Just as an example, I saw Split with them during this period and they hated that too. Everybody is so locked in on Fences and how American it is that you totally skipped over the part where they called a piece of shit like XXX an awesome movie.&&> International audiences just love action movies despite quality.

&&I watched it because I like WW2 history, and because Nolan. &&He's undoubtedly one of the best in the game right now. I have huge respect for the fact that as his career grew and he began taking on large projects for huge studios, the quality of his films never declined.

Nolan has somehow mastered the perfect formula for giant blockbuster hits that still somehow manage to be original, unique, and thought provoking. Not many directors are capable of pulling this off.


&&Nolan's first movie, [Following](https://www.filmstruck.com/us/watch/detail/1300009540), is temporarily in the (Criterion & TCM) Filmstruck app. Nolan shot this movie on weekends over the course of a year or so.

Check out /r/filmstruck if you're a cinephile!

I highly recommend Memento, though, if you haven't seen it.

But even then, it's less about the budget they gave it and more about how little advertising they put out. Unless you were watching Disney Channel or live near the border, advertising for Coco was scarce compared to every other movie Disney put out this year. I saw more advertising for Cars 3 over the summer than I did for Coco.

That definitely bumped its box office.&&I remember reading somewhere that the reason they keep tacking on Chinese side characters in big US blockbusters is because they want to make a fortune in the Chinese Box Office. &&[deleted]&&Yep indeed! Interesting that they chose to exclude adaptations as well, I think that's pretty ridiculous to be honest - some of the mist universally acclaimed  films in their own right have been adaptations. The Godfather, Stalker, Clockwork Orange, The Shining etc &&Boss Baby is an adaptation? I never saw it so I guess I don’t really know what it was about. &&Today OP learned Dunkirk actually Happened. &&... Dunkirk (1958)&&Weekends at Bernies 3: Weekend at Dunkirk.&&Not to mention there's already been a film named [""Dunkirk""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051565/)&&Interesting that you chose that comparison, as the character of ""Mr. Dawson"" (the owner of the boat, played by Mark Rylance) was based on a real sailor at Dunkirk named [Charles Lightoller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lightoller#Second_World_War), who was also the highest ranking survivor of the Titanic crew. So the movies *Dunkirk* and *Titanic* almost share a character.&&I honestly wouldn't call either original. They put new twists but the overall plot is based on true events and stories. They're adaptations.&&It doesn't exactly help when literally any posts related to blockbusters gets an obscene amount of attention in this sub, like we complain about the lack of originality, yet every time something as boring and uneventful as a new teaser poster for an upcoming MCU movie we give it thousands upon thousands of upvotes and leave comment after comment about it. 

Not that there is anything wrong with getting excited about blockbusters, I'm just saying that this sub do encourage people to care more about them than original movies. &&It’s also kind of false outrage, if people like the franchise why wouldn’t the studios keep making movies for it? Plus with the cost of going to the movies anymore I’d rather go see something I know I’m going to like on the big screen vs taking a chance on something that could be good but could also be a major disappointment.&&James Cameron is probably one, but his movies take longer to make nowadays.

Edit: Quentin Tarantino is probably another, though I think he only has 1 more film left or so.&&Did your brain let you forget Michael Bay?&&What about David Fincher and Wes Anderson? Ridley Scott? Steven speilberg, Clint Eastwood, and Martin Scorsese still work. Del toro? Aronofsky? I mean most of those guys still put out original movies more often than not. 

Tim Burton’s films still make a shit ton of movie. But they mostly suck.  &&Cameron has to be the highest grossing director of all time considering how many times he's broken his own record.&&Here's something that's gonna blow your mind... we live in that cinematic universe too.&&Yes. But I don’t get the wEirD cAPItaliZatiOn. Am I missing a reference? &&Exactly. Even his ""weakest"" films are still so much better than anything else out at the time. Just went back and re-watched Insomnia since I saw it in theaters, and, man, did he do a great job with it.&&yeah, but this list doesn't seem to care. The Great Wall came out in 2016 too (in some locations). This list seems to be extremely America-centric, so it seems to be going by general American release dates.&&I'd not consider it an adaptation of the novel. Like, a novel version of A New Hope came out the year before the movie actually did, but it was as part of the movie development process. Seems like an analogous situation to me. &&Was a novel written along side the film by the writer director as a way to help him fully explore his ideas. Not really an adaption &&Because animated movies draw waaay bigger audiences because kids are easy to market towards.

&&Huh, I thought it was a true story.&&I agree; Dunkirk really happened, but all of those individual storylines had to be written.&&So it was an adaption.&&That would definitely make it an adaptation.&&Coco still going strong too.&&Cooper: Hey .exe. what's your installation percentage?

Installer: 99 percent.

Cooper: 99 percent?

Installer: Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic and safest form of installation with emotional beings.&&That's what I get for using SWYPE on mobile and not proofreading.&&I get why tho. They gave Denis Villeneuve $150 million dollars to make *Blade Runner 2049* and they failed to make their money back in it. That being said I don’t even think Tarantino’s budgets tend to be that big, definitely less than Nolan’s.&&+*Spielberg and that Italian American guy that directed Shutter Island (?)
Edit: Martin Scorsese thank you.&&Wouldn't Damien Chazelle be on this list, at least tentatively? &&The score really does make that scene.&&Surprise Matt Damon got me good.&&May as well [leave this here](https://youtu.be/a3lcGnMhvsA).&&'Cooper! This is no time for caution!'&&Contrast that scene with the docking scene from 2001, one of Interstellar's influences.

In 2001 it is like a waltz, a dance, romance. We the audience appreciate it from afar like a crowd watching ballet.

In Interstellar it is like a moshpit, a car crash, a centrifuge. We the audience suffer with the characters.&&“Get ready to match our spin with the retro-thrusters.”

“It’s not possible.”

“No... it’s necessary.”&&You had me at beer&&MURPH! DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!&&The 2nd watch for me was like emotional edging until the docking scene. You knew it was comming since you've already seen it, and it takes a good while to happen. And then when the score kicks in. It's like nothing else i've experienced.&&*Muuuuuurphy*&&[deleted]&&Ita phenomenally acted and directed, the writing was definitely the weakest link though.&&I think the main reason people point out the scientific flaws was they advertised the movie as basically scientifically perfect.

It was a fine movie, but it was sci-fi not sci-fact which is not what they claimed for months and months.&&I love the limited use of CGI. You can really tell on all the docking scenes, too. The whole film has such a cool cinematic feel. &&I meant he's got the power to be able to if he wants to.  It's a small club but he's a member of it.&&The Post is out right now&&He can get anything original made that he wants.  And those are sequels to his own original movie.&&He can do anything he wants, he just happens to want to do more Avatar movies.  

Plus, they're still part of his own original project.  &&Both leave you sweaty and ashamed. &&I got off, didn’t you &&Crime. Penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Penetration. This will just keep going until the movie sort of ends.&&Make him an actual NOSE, a FULL BODIED NOSE WITH THE VOICE OF DULPH LUNDGREN&&This comment is an adaptation or remake.&&Good call. You don’t wanna hide that body behind a lab coat. &&It's no different than silent movies. Chaplin kept doing silent movies, because he knew the international audiences would still love him and go see his movies due to the universality of physical humor (also he ""knew"" how to make silent movies).


I've been in a similar situation. I've seen little kids in rural Morocco 
who loved Bugs Bunny and Looney Tunes due to the humor. And everyone in my host family loved and knew who Mr. Bean was.

Meanwhile I Loved Mul Taxi's first lead (it was a Moroccan sitcom), because the lead was big and blustery and the comedy was very physical. Then they replaced him with a skinny dude who was ""even funnier!"" in Moroccan Arabic, but didn't do the big funny scenes. All of his stuff was verbal.

&&>Fences is a 2016 American period drama film directed by and starring Denzel Washington and written by August Wilson.

Well considering its a period piece about the 1950's that probably had a lot of race relation subtext that wasnt seen in other countries at the time, among quite a few other aspects that would confuse non-americans, I am not that surprised they found it a little odd.&&I haven't seen either one of these movies, but I can quite easily understand why they wouldn't like Fences (judging from the trailer). It might be hard to get into a movie set in a completely separate culture from theirs - I myself have no desire to see it either, as a Dane. Lots of American movies are centered around very unique, American problems. It's hard to relate to most of those types of movies as a European&&Took my friends to watch 'True Grit' in India and they didn't understand what anybody was saying with their thick southern accent. Got a whole week of grilling from my friends on my ""weird tastes"" in movies.

To be fair, I later found out a lot of Americans themselves didn't understand shit what Jeff Bridges says either.&&Fences is one of the biggest gab-fests I've seen in years though. And the issues it deals with are somewhat American. &&And  yet his best roles are as a voice actor&&Been there Dunkirk&&Dunkirk Dos&&& Knuckles&&What, you mean like a map maker getting lost?

Or a scientist removing his helmet on an alien world for no reason?

Stuff like that?&&Don't forget about the Nazi androids that finger a flute. &&Valve would like a word&&Look at the first one. They sold it as the GREAT WAR. Yeah. Then why did a second one come out? Maybe im just mad I spilled my popcorn. &&That crappy Cold War spinoff was lame. It was like watching Lost. &&But it usually has the best special effects.&&Sodenburgh(spellcheck) did Magic Mike because people told him he couldnt make a movie like that.&&“Where are my pants!?”

BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&&Joe Pantoliano was funny in Memento; Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were very snarky in Inception. I could see it.&&And I thought my jokes were bad.&&To me the #1 defining thing about Tarantino has to be the dialogues.&&I still can't get over the fact that he's seriously flirting with doing the next Star Trek movie. I think they hired the writer of The Revenant for it? What a crazy combination. As a life long Trek fan (but not really what you'd call a Trekkie as it's not like my absolute favorite TV+movie franchise and I don't have my own uniform or anything like that) I'm pretty interested to see if this actually happens, because it's like a peanut and mustard sandwich. So bad sounding on paper but would it be interesting to see someone try to eat. I like Tarantino, and I like Trek... but do I like them together? I hope I get to find out.&&Visually probably but I'd say for atmosphere/tone Hitchcock's the most recognisable.&&[deleted]&&It's just a shame about his views on ATMOS and other modern audio technologies. I guess we are lucky he didn't stick with just stereo.&&He made his Batman trilogy extremely intriguing and original. No gimmicks and nothing that screamed mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. That’s where I learned of Nolan and that’s when I wanted to watch everything he had done in the past and everything he releases in the future. &&They're a team sometimes, not all the time, and not ever in the directorial phase of the movies. Jonathan helps with the scripts occasionally, but Dunkirk was all Nolan for example.&&His subdued performance really stood out to me. It felt really realistic and not overplayed. Quite unique in an era where every other dog fighting movie is a variation of Top Gun or Independence Day.&&It was so bad they had to remove it in Mexico because of how much pushback it got &&Part of the issue is length: it's not merely a five or six minute short, it's approximately twenty-two minutes. This is the first time in over twenty years a Disney film has had that long a short in front of it. 

And then there's content: Olaf was the comic relief of *Frozen.* Despite his popularity, not many would want a continual run of the comic relief for that long. And then there's the songs--repetitive and not nearly as memorable as the original movie's.

Most damningly, the presence of the Olaf short film meant that there wasn't a Pixar short film, which are held in almost universal high esteem.

Edit: a word&&Taking an age appropriate child to a movie is hard enough. Extending that movie an extra 20 minutes to see a short about a character i'm tired of seeing is enough to push me over the line. &&Pixar movies have a 5 minute short at the start. Usually some original animation with a fun self contained short story sort of deal. I recommend googling and watching a few, they're classics

Coco, instead of the 5 minute short, had a 20 minute short starring Olaf from Frozen as he collects Christmas traditions. Instead of a usual inspiring story, it was an advertisement for Frozen. &&It's way too long. &&I got hired at a movie theater in September of 2016. The first week of November (the weekend Dr. Strange came out), advertisements for Boss Baby had gone up *everywhere*. Stickers on the bathroom doors, a banner above the bar (for some reason), a standee in one of the hallways, and a massive banner with the Alec Bladwin baby's creepy snear on the wall in another hallway. All of that stayed up till early April, when the movie had been out for a bit.

All I could think was ""why are they putting all this money into a stupid movie that will come out, do ok-ish at best at the box office, and then be forgotten about""? Then, we proceed to have it for weeks, get a ton of people buying tickets for it, and actually had parents angry at us the first weekend we lost it (a whole 2 and a half months or so after it came out, at that). Clearly, I'm not Nostradamus when it comes to box office trends.&&La Llorona gets stuck in my head, but Recuérdame makes me cry. I liked Star Wars and Thor, but Coco is my favorite.&&But Moana did great&&Exchange student in Mexico here. It was wildly popular in Mexico, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It reminded me so much of how the people of this country has welcomed me with open arms.&&Well, I can at least I can say on my end they're wrong.

Make a good movie, I'll watch it. I'm excited to see Coco.&&A staggering amount of Disney movies in the past 20 years are about non-white characters and set outside America. I don't get why people still think this.&&Mulan? Princess and the Frog? Aladdin? I don't buy that Disney was making movies they thought wouldn't sell.&&Why do you think this? They’ve made “nonwhite” animated movies for a long time. Pocahontas, Aladdin, the Princess and the Frog, Mulan, The Jungle Book, The Emperor’s New Groove, Lilo and Stitch...&&I'm still sore about that. The sequel they had planned would have been amazing. They sent a summer film out to die against HARRY POTTER and their own Santa Clause two. Freaking tragic.&&Which was especially sad because it was sort of the end of the hybrid of traditional and digital animation that they'd put together with Tarzan. The rumor is that it was killed off by politics, which makes it even sadder.&&New Zealand and America are romantically engaged&&It's more that if you want to do really well overseas nowadays, you need that China money. China doesn't give a shit about racism.&&I watched it a few days ago. It's basically a very patriotic film about an almost invincible retired special forces dude fucking shit up in Africa.

The plot arrives half empty but the film's action and fighting scenes are top notch (not super high quality but good fun) . Still, I suspect the jingoistic nature of the film helped it greatly at the Chinese box office &&How could I forget? Oh that's right, how the fuck would I know?&&The rules were changed slightly a couple of year ago, but there's a limited amount of external films that are allowed to be released in china so they don't harm their own film.
I think part of the criteria for choosing the films may come down to Chinese characters in them.&&I think the idea is that adaptations are considered ""safer"" than original ideas, but I agree that leaving them out entirely is misleading. Generally, I'd say adaptations of previously unadapted works are closer to original movies than to franchises. (Though I think Boss Baby would be the only movie covered by that on this list? I guess technically Wonder Woman never had her own theatrical film before...)&&It's loosely based on a picture book by Marla Frazee (https://www.amazon.com/Boss-Baby-Classic-Board-Books/dp/1442487798)&&Or, ""WW2 1940, see the original!""&&I'm genuinely surprised there is only one. Dunkirk is a huge part of the general cultural mythos around WWII—up there with D-Day, the Battle of Britain and Pearl Harbour.

The issue wasn't confusion it was just that for most people if they're seeing a foreign language film they'd rather it focus on visuals or action than on dialogue.&&I don't see why that is necessary though.

Oh, I'm chasing this guy.

[Dodd shoots at Leonard]

 No... he's chasing me. &&Tom Hardy was also fucking hilarious in Bronson. I know he pulls a bit more comedy then dark. But he's better known for his darker roles. &&Hey, we got a Trekkie over here guys!

I know I will be down voted into oblivion, but I personally can't stand superhero movies and get so tired of Hollywood producing the exact same schlock over and over again, literally dozens of times, and yet each new film becomes a billion dollar blockbuster. 

The Batman trilogy was unique, interesting, and I really liked how dark they felt compared to most comic book films that are more upbeat and full of humour. Despite this though, the Batman trilogy still rank as my least favourite Nolan films. I just don't get excited about Batman lol.&&They removed it in the US as well.

EDIT: Apparently it was always meant to be a limited run.&&And eventually in the US. Just took longer to pull the plug&&Important thing to note is that the length was an extra problem because you've got kids anxious to see the actual movie. An adult has to wait an extra twenty minutes on stupid crap, they think well this sucks. A little kid has to do it-- and remember, it's the twenty minute short, plus ten or fifteen minutes of previews, plus a few minutes of the theater's ""turn off your phones, go get concessions"" stuff, plus however early you decided to show up for the movie

And by the end of it you've got yelly cranky kids who have to take potty breaks in the middle of the movie and don't want to sit still that long after three and a half hours or so now

And it's like come on. It's really tough for kids to be cool about that.

Ahh that explains it breaking records. I've heard stories where Chinese theaters give people tickets to a certain movie no matter what movie the person goes to see, they do it in order to make that movie seem like it is more popular than it really is.
&&We talked about this over dinner&&Kung Fu Panda killed it in the Chinese box office, alot of Chinese people thought it was way better than domestic Chinese animated films and iirc that's when China changed the rules because they want to make sure the stuff they put out is always seen as better.&&It feels like a stretch to put that on the same level. The main similarity is the idea of a baby acting like a boss, and there's only a few paragraphs worth of the original material to begin with. If we're considering that tenuous connection as an actual adaptation, then ""Dunkirk"" is more of an adaptation of the Battle of Dunkirk.  

Edit: I guarantee Nolan, et al. spent more time researching and basing ""Dunkirk"" off of written records than the people behind ""The Boss Baby"" did for the picture book.&&It was on the front page this last week&&That he followed up the biggest movie of all time 12 years later with the biggest movie of all time is so absurd. &&I guess it depends on how you define blockbuster.

The Island, which made its money back internationally, is the closest to a flop we could get, everything else at least cleared their budgets domestically. He's routinely been in the ""top money makers of the year"" category.

We argued A LOT more than usual when it came to movies that had more plot than your average action movie too.

In the end, no matter what we chose, they were losing out anyway. A lot is lost in translation, voice actors aren't that great, Spanish is specially annoying because there are words/expressions that sound off to me, but are perfectly normal to other people in South America. 

At least studios or whoever are spending enough to hire actual Latin American subbers/voices actors, because there was nothing that felt more off than listening to a spaniard doing that work... and from what I've read around, they seem to feel the same way about our voice overs.&&2Dun2kirk.&&Dunkirk Checks In&&Revenge of the Dunkirk&&I say we nuke the site from orbit&&Just pure laziness.

They also kind of picked the wrong film to put it in front of. Stick something like that in front of Cars 2 or The Good Dinosaur, I think complaints would be a lot less prominent. Stick it in front of a movie getting lauded like Coco and you create a problem. People would probably be fine with a long short if it preceded a 'meh' movie, rather than an excellent one. &&Yeah, that’s way too much.

But with a 22 minute “short” plus Coco, clocking in at 1 hr 49 min, that’s 2 hr 11 min. Even adults are getting antsy at that point.

And separately, can we talk about the damn trailers? My wife and I saw The Last Jedi and they went on and on and on. Give it a rest already, especially given you can watch trailers anywhere and anytime these days. 


&&Oh I forgot about that one! Doesn't that one end with him having a heart attack?&&and lilo and stitch&&You relly deeg thet eeccent, bro?&&Well the action is good but ithere are still quite a lot of cuts during those scenes so you don't get free flowing scenes like Jackie chain's stuff or Ip man. Obviously it's not to the level of Taken and it's better than most western movies, but in terms of camerawork it doesn't quite hold up.

The action scenes are still the main draw of the film but it's not a classic in any sense. It's hard to think of a good comparison to a western film though.

I won't say it's a film you should go out of your way to watch but it's something I might tune in to if it popped up on TV and there wasn't much else to watch ,  which it won't since I don't live in China &&It’s really weird in fact, because for the first 20 minutes of the movie the whole ‘baby is a boss’ thing is *clearly* a metaphor for the new baby in the house etc, and then it changes tack and becomes this conspiracy where he’s really a tiny baby businessman.&&Well damn it, this is why I can't have anything nice!&&He's definitely a blockbuster director; I just don't think the ""regularly working"" label applies.&&Tarantino isn't a blockbuster director,  his highest grossing film is Django Unchained at $162 million. His overall adjusted gross for all nine of his films is $922 million, or just over $105 million per film. His films obviously make money and are great, but that have very little overseas draw and are obviously limited with their hard-R rating.

About 60 artists who created hero makeups and background masks in 'Bright' were left out of the credits,88756,7m8jj0,http://mailchi.mp/085eaa6ab878/credit-where-credit-is-due?e=b6c2e1f081,4476,1514304489.0,,"[Alec Gillis of StudioADI is in this thread now](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7m8jj0/about_60_artists_who_created_hero_makeups_and/drsv0aa/)&&I was asked to be life casted  as the “frozen lava man” at the end of the hallway in the apartment. I knew I was asked to do this as a favor under the table and never expected a credit. That said, the two people who did the work of building that sculpt were not in the final credits, which I thought was odd. ADI didn’t even include them in their list of uncredited folk, but then again these two may have been contracted outside of that wheel house. I forget the last name of guy who did my cast (it was over a year ago) but Frank and Kelsey Berk deserve recognition for their contributions. &&Thanks for your interest in our credit issue. BRIGHT was a blast. I've been in the MU and Creature FX biz for 37 years (I was on the poster for ALIEN NATION, the movie) and I can tell you that Netflix supports their directors like it was 1987. We designed Orcs (along with Chris Nelson) directly with David Ayer and w/o a cc list as long as your arm. That's why when our crew was omitted from the credits we knew it was an unintentional oversight. The producers and Netflix have contacted us with their apologies.

If you love Practical FX, please see BRIGHT. It's been a long time since we in the Special Makeup community have worked on a film this big, and even longer since we've shot in Los Angeles. We're grateful to Netflix for the opportunity to ply our craft.

I'll be responding to comments - feel free to ask me questions!&&It's not like the movie has hit theatres and they can't fix it.&&As someone in the VFX industry. We get left out in the credits for works we put months and months to do. It's a common and sad practice.
EDIT:  Okkk this blew up. I see a lot of you are interested in more of this so I might answer some more stuff after work! :) &&Q: besides respect or acknowledgment, is there any professional / career impact these individuals may have from not being in credits? Like ate they unable to cite the film as previous experience? (I think it's not cool to be left out of credits but trying to understand if there's any determinantal impact to their career as well) &&Just put them in the credits, Netflix. 

It's such a small/easy thing to do but probably means a lot.&&This is another example of Hollywood not appreciating the talents of effects people.&&Not condoning it but every film has hundreds of uncredited people work on them. &&Issue here, is any non-unionized job, this is the only way you can be legitimized. Problem is, is that if you're not in a union, sometimes you will be left out, especially if you have been hired as a contractor and they're trying to avoid paying you. And it happens. A lot. 

Anyone providing any product or service to a movie, do not allow terms. It's cash before delivery. I will tell you from experience you need to. Do not let them get away with promising to put you in the credits, because they'll always 'forget.'&&This is actually pretty common. More common than people know, especially for VFX crews. I have worked on movies and never got a screen credit, I have also worked on a job for one day and was screen credited. It doesn't matter anyway. Nobody is looking at your resume and then watching the movies to verify your name. Most below the line crew are hired based on expertise and reputation, or a recommendation. Its not producers hiring these people either, but the supervisors of their respective departments. It is nice to see your name up there though. &&This is standard practice, at least in VFX. Hundreds of people are regularly left out of the credits on movies, or they'd be ridiculously long. For big-budget movies, VFX vendors will either get a company credit, or the supervisors/leads will get credit, or they'll get a fixed allotment of credits that they can give out (say 300 people in a company worked on a movie, but you're allowed 100 credits). Some companies (like ILM) have enough clout that they can push back, but most small and medium-sized companies just have to be grateful that they got the gig.

The really annoying thing is that if you try and add the credit for yourself on IMDB, sometimes it gets rejected or marked as uncredited because of this.&&This is not uncommon. Why is Netflix being singled out?&&I work in the film industry & this is common practice, it seems that they pick the names at complete random when it comes to the credits. &&[deleted]&&I thought the movie was ok, but they touched on a seriously rich history that could work really well for a series. They could spend seasons fleshing out the big event and the 2,000 years since and incorporate it into a good cop drama. &&I think it’s more important that they are at least recognized on IMDb  and online &&It doesn’t just happen in Hollywood. I edited together a music vid for a very famous rock stars side project and when it was released on DVD I didn’t even get a credit on the box. I was paid nothing albeit I didn’t ask but to be left off the credits on the DVD was a big “fuck your very much” from him. &&Before we jump on Netflix, it might have been the fault of the company they contracted out. 
Not sure how they had their agreement setup (between the artist and either a middle company or Netflix themselves? 

Sometimes they only put the important people’s names ( ceo, vp and director) when you’re dealing with middle man.  It’s an ego thing really. 

Kinda sucks but this isn’t that uncommon 

Again, I’m not privey to how they had this setup so it’s all assumptions and experience from me 

Source. Worked in the film industry. &&Ok, not to be picky about this, I'd like them to get credit, but what does their contract say?  Does it stipulate that they appear in the credits?  If not, then I'm not going to be super stressed about it.&&I've  been working professionally in makeup and Practical effects for 3 years and worked on titles such as Dc Legends of Tomorrow, Dirk Gently and Stephen Kings 1922. In those 3 years i have not once been credited for any of my work. &&Randomly came across ""Bright."" Thought it looked cheesy. Watched it and couldn't turn away. Loved the movie.&&Funny, I just watched this last night. Really great movie and the design team did an awesome job. I was constantly dissecting the work on the Orks faces the entire time, almost to a fault. Still though, brilliant work.&&I never read the credits. &&How come we still put names/credits on movies and games, while most other industries do not do something like this? To me, it makes sense to list the companies behind or maybe have a list of them available for business partners etc.&&I am genuinely shocked this got such crappy reviews. I think it's a refreshing change from the recycled universes out there, I'd love to see more.&&This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't get the whole credits thing. Why should I care about the caterer and the 2nd jolly grip or whatever.

I mean, there are no credits on my ketchup bottle saying who picked the tomatoes etc...

Or the electricians who set up the lighting? &&Aside from ego, why do credits even exist?&&Now, if this true I'm not saying it's okay or not wrong (people deserve credit) but man, it really does feel like there's an agenda against Netflix, and this movie in particular...

I wonder why!?! Seems like Netflix are ruffling plenty of feathers in the film industry and I love it! &&Isn't it because they work uncredited and get paid more that way? That's how the industry works. You get less for a credit. &&I have pioneered several projects at work and don't get any credit, I get money. That's generally how it works. Do work, get paid. It would be nice to have my name on a plaque somewhere with all the things I've done, but i don't expect it. &&I’m a set paramedic...if we’re even included, it’s usually after the caterer and downplayed as “First Aid Person.”  &&Reddit seems determined to get me to hate this movie.

But I mean, you guys liked Baby Driver, so what the fuck do you know. &&Shame, it was such a good movie too. A bit rushed, not enough background explained, and one of those ""too much story for too short of a movie"" deals, but I would LOVE to see more from this universe. A series for sure, or at least more movies. Tons of potential.&&Okay this and other things coming out recently really make me feel like there is a campaign happening against Netflix. It's being targeted but it's being attacked by taking on individual things being released. 

I'm not saying people aren't doing bad things and shouldn't get punished for them. They are and they should! I'm saying the main things lately seem to be harming one business more than others where it's said these practices have been going on for decades.&&How does one even become a makeup artist?&&Credit snubbing...it hurts.  Our entire location department outside of the manager was left out of the Goosebumps credits, and it seriously just made my heart sink after putting so much effort into that project.  We all left knowing the job we did but feeling defeated...sucked.&&I bet the artist who puts the credits together gets included every time.&&It sounds like this isn't a Netflix problem, but an industry problem.&&Omg that's horrible.  Will they survive?&&Does anyone pay attention to the credits anyways beyond the cast that they see in it?


I mean... I put in over 2000 hours per year designing, developing, marketing products for the company I work for.


Guess how many customers see my name in the product manual, on the box, or on the company website? 


Zero. 


I get paid to do my job. I don't get to put my name on it.  
&&Well hey, I now have you tagged as “Frozen Lava Man.” You’ve finally made it, my man.&&That looked pretty cool! Were you the one with your head on fire in the movie? The whole effect with the fire added was pretty gnarly!&&Did they get credited as a business rather than individuals?&&Someone else on here said the practical effects felt very “tangible” instead of typical CGI and I couldn’t agree more. I haven’t felt that immersed in a universe in a very long time. It all felt very grounded, very tangible, very real. 

I was looking forward to the movie for awhile, eager to check out the world, the characters and the different creatures, and was SO worried that it’d be a CGI-fest which would’ve turned me off immediately, but you and your team delivered MUCH more than I was hoping for. 

I’m sure there was some CGI at play, but practical effects anchored it so well... 

No question, just wanted to say absolutely amazing work, and thank you for taking this opportunity to turn one of the raddest concepts  into a stunning movie with some of the most realistic creature effects I’ve ever seen.  &&I've told all of my Shadowrun gaming buddies they should watch this movie because it is the closest we're ever going to get to a Shadowrun movie.&&Keep fighting the good fight. 

And as a moviegoer I wasn't aware that people who work on something aren't always given credit until now. You should get together with other uncredited people and make it a wider issue &&People need to show some interest in the amazing detail the orcs had In this film. This is hopefully a step away from CGI characters.&&You're the man, Alec. I actually had the chance to visit your studio twice as a little kid for field trips with school (I had a class with your daughter). It was like 20+ years ago now, but I remember you being a great host. I'll never forget all the Tremors and Aliens creatures that were there. Certainly piqued my interest in film at a very young age.

Keep doing what you're doing!&&It would probably take......minutes to fix lol.&&I hope you're a chef lol  nice name &&Damn, that sucks. 

Could you ask for it in your contract or is that not even a thing?&&Why is that? How hard is it to put someone’s name in the credits? What’s their reasoning for not including those names?&&I work in VFX production on the studio side, and have been a producer on the facility side. [Credits](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1198059/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).
  
Credits are a touchy issue on all sides. The fact is that it takes a shit-ton of people to create these movies, and the majority of them are in VFX... by far. There's many political and monetary factors that go into credits that people don't realize, but the main one is the fear of unionization.
  
Credits are used in deal making. VFX supervisor and producer credits are now featured on their own cards in the beginning of the movie. That's because Hollywood agencies have pushed for them in the past 10 years since VFX department heads are pretty much capped at a $10k a week rate. That sounds like a shit ton of money, but other department heads are capped at that rate due to their union rules. So a cinematographer who's been working in Hollywood since the 80's has probably been making $10k a week since the 90's-00's. Though VFX is not part of a union, the studios know that if they paid their department heads more then the unions would come after them. So veteran VFX supervisors are capped, which means they have to look for other ways to get a good deal, and one of those ways is a credit.
  
This is an elaborate way of saying that credits are part of a struggle within the industry to classify work, workers, pay scale, and most importantly union involvement. If you took all the people who worked on a large movie and gave them a credit, you would see a HUGE difference in the amount of VFX people that put their hands on the film. This would tip off the unions to say wait a second, how much power do we really have over collective bargaining if 40% of the movie is done in VFX? That would drive unions harder to go after a VFX union because that amount of non-union people could affect their bargaining power. Like I mentioned above, the deals that VFX people make can affect the deals that the non-VFX people make.
  
Also, movies have always been skewed toward the production phase. You could be a PA on a film for the production and get a credit, but a PA in post production might not. That's from a 100 year old culture within the film industry that cherishes the set life. Post production is just a bunch of nerds putting the film together. But what we're seeing is a shift from a three part system (pre, during, post), to a one part system. Post production teams are being assembled even before shooting begins, because they have to cut animatics, previs, and rough assemblies of the footage. As a VFX production person myself I have to be on during all three phases, even though 90% of our work is done in post, and we start asset building and postvis right out of the camera gate. Hollywood has not caught up to this line of thinking. That the film set is only shooting 60% of your movie, the other 40% is done in VFX. So we're no longer ""visual effects"" but ""digital production"".
  
So it's a classic case of Hollywood wanting its cake and eating it too. They want the magic that VFX affords them, but they don't want to pay for it or give it proper credit, or even a union. The main attitude of Hollywood is ""you're privileged just to work here"". That's how it gets away with everything from fucking over VFX companies to fucking their assistants. It's the unions who go ""fuck you, pay us"", but right now the VFX industry is being led by old men who don't want to ruffle the feathers of Hollywood, and their own standing in the industry, and refuse to form a coalition to fight this. (I'm looking at you, VES). But the more dependent they are on VFX, the more people, in every country, is going to get sick of it and finally unionize.&&I never get documented credit for any of my work. I get cash. Imagine if every service or product had credits attached like movie. That would be pretty wierd...&&I was really looking forward to seeing my credit in ""IT"" imagine my heartbreak when I saw my company but not my name.  

Concept artists get shit on even though we design major elements of a film. 

Hiding credits hides the real production value of a show and is deceptive to audiences.

At least ADI acknowledged it for their artists. All I got was a ""good job""&&Being in the credits makes it a lot easier to verify your claim that you were in it. A lot of people will use IMDB to quickly build a work history for their resume, and lacking the credits on that list makes things more difficult.&&As they would have been paid, included their work in portfolios and resumes, it's not likely that they would need the credits to prove that they worked on the film. That said, with a credit it is easier to prove it where necessary, especially in a world that relies very heavily on imdb, but you don't need to be credited in the end credits to be credited on imdb (many imdb film entries contain (uncredited) names). 

However, while these people don't *rely* on movie credits to obtain future work, there are a ton of eyes on those credits which does function as advertising and as someone else said if you're building your resume/history off of imdb it will be easier to achieve if you are mentioned in the credits.&&""i worked on the costumes for bright!""   
""imdb says no loser, i have a boyfriend""&&Not really. No one goes through credits as a way to verify your work. They will go by word of mouth over credits. If they need verification then a call sheet will do. &&Netflix could hire someone to make that change and have it up and finished in half a day. If they want. &&Isn't there more to it than that? Like doesn't having them in the credits grant them some additional rights?&&It’s not netflix, it’s the production company...

My effect studio is about 150 people big, so even HR and Accounting get in, we’re that “small”. the credits have a fixed space allocation per company, some will have way more people than that so that’s why they can’t fit everyone in.

As soon as you have practical effects, the list increases exponentially department-wise. So they cut people so long as all the department leads are on the list.&&[deleted]&&Problem is the unions will get pissed at Netflix for it. How dare non-union workers and union workers be in the same credits.

I fucking hate the unions around LA. I understand they were/are necessary, but they turned from protecting workers from Studios into protecting established workers from other workers and competition and trying to squeeze every ounce of money from producers and studios.

Been trying to get union for ages and keep getting majorly screwed. They don’t give a shit about me. I don’t want to take union work away from them but they don’t let me be union without jumping through the stupidest fucking loops. I’m just trying to survive. &&And in a movie that lived and died on makeup. If Joel Edgerton hadn’t been able to emote the way he was, if the extras hadn’t seemed real, if anything had seemed manufactured or untouched; I wouldn’t have believed in the world they created like I did. It was so refreshing to not have everything be CGI and instead tangible. To hear that the people that came together as a team to give us that aren’t being given the one credit they truly deserve, is disheartening. &&Meanwhile, the internet has seen people build their entire careers off of their effects work (Corridor Digital, etc.)&&It sounds like this was unintentional (they say so in the article, after all), so this might have just been a benign mix-up. Maybe the email with the credits didn't make it to the right person or something.&&Hyjacking the top comment here. This is nothing new in the film industry. If you really took each and every person who worked on a film and included them in the credits, the credits themselves would be longer than the film itself. Doesn't matter if they're makeup, production assistants, vfx, extras, etc...

Source: vfx artist who hasn't made the credits on a number of productions. Despite having worked on them.&&Not only are they not credited, but they are probably massively underpaid too.&&Is that unusual? I mean there are always hundreds of digital effects artists who aren't credited on every single thing you see... But some mask makers get snubbed and suddenly it's news? &&Just watched this yesterday, quality film! Feels like a comic franchise without the cheese. Loved it hope they make follow ups

Edit: fuck the haters&&I hope it doesn’t affect their work&&This is true, even at those VFX places.  They might get every artist in, but the person who set up their renderfarm isn't going to be in, nor their janitor, let alone the developers who worked on the off-the-shelf software being used,  even though without them creating the VFX would be problematic at best. 

However, a case can be made that those two did not have a direct hand in the creative process, whereas Gregg Pixelman - even if they only did a bit of wire removal on 18 frames - did (depending on whether or not one sees that as part of a 'creative' process.  )

I figure if you directly produced a pixel or sample in the sound, either you should get credit if other people with similar tasks do, or none should get credit, leaving only e.g. the VFX supe or even just the name of the VFX company.

&&Shhhh Reddit's got the pitchforks out man! You can't stop the tide, don't be a fool!&&> Do not let them get away with promising to put you in the credits, because they'll always 'forget.'

Honestly I think casting Will Smith was a misstep (he basically is playing the same guy he always does) and the plot was a little predictable with him ending up as a bright.

It was fun which is all it needed to be. It was DND meets Bad Boys which is a combo that is fun as hell. The film was a visual spectacle as shown by the stylized action and effects, charmingly funny as shown by Jackoby’s testimony to the Feds, and took place in such a cool world. It isn’t being given credit for what it is.

Flaws were present for sure and no one is denying it but calling it “a steaming pile of orc shit” because didn’t explore race relations in America enough and was otherwise racist in how it depicted the chollo gangbangers.

Everyone I know loved it. It's at a 90% for users on rotten. &&Totally agree, my buddy enjoyed it as well. Definitely not amazing but average at worse. I really like the world they tried to build. Something I didn't like was how cheesy some of the story was, but I just don't know how to make ""magic wand"" even somewhat serious.&&It's got its fair share of problems. It had a distinct ""Pilot Episode"" feel to it, in that so much went unexplained (which I kind of liked, they didn't feel the need to spoon feed exposition at us constantly), and the focus was on action, shootouts, explosions rather than exploring the universe being presented. Bit of fun, though. Hope it does get expanded somewhere down the line (rumoured sequel hurrah, would work better as a series).&&I have a checklist for you:

☑️ Is the topic something most people have no knowledge about?

☑️Is the topic shared in a way that implies something malicious but may have a reasonable explanation? 

☑️Can the answer be found by a quick google search? (That no one will do, yet still have an opinion to share)

If you can answer all 3 with a yes, then I would say it is our new thing.&&Yeah kinda hilarious how badly the critics panned it yet all my friends loved it. The day before it released though my Alexa gave me a flash briefing saying ""Bright Bombed"" which I thought was odd considering it hadn't even come out yet, is a Netflix movie, and how do you even do the math on how much that movie would make ya know esp before it even came out? Not saying there's an agenda, but it was very odd.&&Agreed what the fuck is this? 54k upvotes in a few hours. You expect makeup artists to be credited?

&&Not nessecarily. Changing scenes regardless if it's just a bunch of text takes time to encode and render in most software applications.&&There isn’t some master Netflix wizard who sits at the main computer connected to the Netflix that just uploads the files you watch like it’s YouTube. That’s not how digital distribution works. 

The file you watch on Netflix is transcoded from a master file that is made at a facility separate than that where they did the finishing (color correction/sound mix) on the film or even the edit.  And that file is made from its own set of outputs that would have to be created. While the actual ‘fix’ seems like it would take minutes, as someone who has done end credit scrolls I can say it does not. 

And while for them it may be small change, but to fix this at this point would probably cost a couple thousand dollars and take a lot longer than a minute. 

Not only that but the addition of 60 names would probably change the time of the credits. Meaning the music would have to be extended which would mean a new mix would have to be created.  That mix would be both a 5.1 and a 2.0. Those would the. Need to be transcoded to the source that is wanted. You get the point. 

These fixes might sound simple but they are not. &&Actually, it would take a while and cost thousands. 

They would have to:

1) Have the titles creator change the credits

2) Have the editor add in the new credits into the Avid

3) Have the music editors correct the end credit music length

4) Have the dub stage print out a new master with the updated music

5) Combine all of this into an updated deliverables package. For a film hitting theaters this would be a DCP, not sure exactly what nexflix does for their finals but likely something similar but for online distribution.

Their names should absolutely be in the credits. But it's a lot more complicated than throwing some new text into the scroll in iMovie.&&Not a chance. &&Haha you too!&&It's not even a thing. One major hollywood movie I work two summers ago, we did one of the biggest CG shot in it. My coworker who at least put 4 months on the project didn't get his name in the credits. I worked for 3 months on it and didn't either. The bigger the movie, the more meaningless you are. They put HR of vfx companies before CG artists.&&If they put the name of every VFX artist in the credits for a big budget film like Avengers or something, the credits would easily be a half hour long. VFX artists are a dime a dozen. Over 15 different VFX shops contribute to a movie like that, and some of them even subcontract out to smaller shops when they bit off more than they can chew. It's common practice to only credit a couple of names like the supervisors when listing all the contract shops. Subcontracted shops don't get any mention at all... &&From my understanding, when a vfx company bids on a shot they often get a fixed number of names they're allotted for the credits.

VFX is very different from the rest of the film industry because it came on much later; it's not unionized and often a fixed bid contract, which introduces all sorts of problems.&&Run time. Generally you only get a credit if you do the entire project. I work in the camera department and haven’t been credited as B cam because they only gave A camera credits. It happens to everyone in every department and honestly isn’t something to get that upset about. If movies gave credits to day players they would be 3 times as long. &&Thank you for placing your Amazon Prime order. 

Rolls credits of 340,000 employees for 45 minutes. &&Lol a bus stop having the names of everyone even the slightest bit involved in it written on the back. Or a card with the name of every person who contributed to the making of your cheeseburger you got at the drive thru. I don't get why people in the film industry get so bent out of shape over their name not being in the credits. Did you get paid? Can you still put your work in a portfolio or on a resume? Yes and yes? Well then chill! Be grateful you got that job and you got paid!&&You can have an IMDb entry even if you don't make the credits. You'll often see it listed as (uncredited). This is both for crew as well as cast whose scenes were cut from the final edit.&&That said, it seems like being left out of credits is such a widespread practice for certain jobs (like vfx) that potential employers would know they need to look further than imdb credits results.&&Credited costume designers get all the girls.&&Imdb often provides credits for people that worked on the film that weren't credited.&&You're telling me I can put my data analyst jobs on my resume even though my name was left off all our PowerPoints?

(I know this is a spurious analogy, but are people seriously suggesting prospective employers rely on credits to verify job history?)

E: /u/Delyse2077 offers a good explanation as to why, in the film industry, crediting is actually very valuable in confirming work done. &&I like that this, the correct answer, is so low.&&Wouldn't even have to put *that* person in the credits!&&Intern 

Hell, I’ll do it for fun &&Just to expand on this I believe you are right. Bright would have certainly been a union production and various unions have different laws in their contracts when it comes to being credited. The big question is do visual effects artists have a union that protects them from this sort of thing? I can't seem to find any info on one. &&Tons of people that work on movies won’t get credited. Usually their company will though. &&I think it's both. I work at a similar sized company but we did 80% of the vfx for a film last year but they only included 4 people from my department, when we had 8 people total. 

My company has proved it cares about its artists time and time again, so I can only conclude it was the film's production company that made that decision. &&Mr. Net Flixon. &&LA union member here, the fight to become union is long and difficult.  Your frustration comes from being left out, but let's clarify.  One of the reasons the union doesn't just let every person in right out of the gate is that they don't want a large number of non-working people with a vote and a lack of contacts.  I've had friends who got in the union very early in their careers without any contacts who were union to hire them, which resulted in a person paying expensive dues and having no work.  Our unions don't find you work, that isn't their primary purpose.  Look at SAG/AFTRA for instance. They have huge unemployed membership who get to decide things for the actual active working members.  This is toxic and dilutes the power structure.  
Keep on my friend.  The road is difficult and long but worth it if you love it.  &&I watched it a second time.  I didn't notice the fucking dragon flying over LA the first time around.

I seriously hope they make more movies in the same universe - because holy shit!&&How hard could it possibly be to put someone’s fucking name in the credits?!&&Was that centaur practical effects?&&>  To hear that the people that came together as a team to give us that aren’t being given the one credit they truly deserve, is disheartening.

These appearances in the lists of people at the end of film reels are professional currency. For some circles in hollywood, these 60-odd artists didn't officially work on this particular film. They ""just"" worked in the same building as a company that worked on that film. 

Sure there are steps you can take to prove your skills, or you can just point to your name on the extended cast list on the IMDB page. These people work job to job and next year's income may be heavily influenced by their ability to do this or not.

This is sad because bright had such good practical effects and these artists might not get a chance to shine again because of this.&&How was the movie? Reviews seem to be fairly average?&&Excuse me for not understanding but if Hollywood is so dependent on these people to make great movies, why can't the FX industry raise prices as a whole and grab Hollywood by the balls? Im guessing these studios like Netflix are hiring in-house artists and directly underpaying them? And some of these artists are so poor but have no choice to accept these jobs, keeping wages low? Just trying to understand what's going on.&&It's wonderful being able to make stuff directly for an audience without studio interference.&&Not everyone who works on a movie gets a credit.&&Sirgeeeo's comment leads me to believe he didn't even read the article.&&[deleted]&&Well **we** love you!

*This comment would not be possible without the kind support provided by /u/raxxius*&&This I doubt, makeup is one of the highest paid departments on sets. Usually around $60 an hour with 1.5x OT from 8-12 hours and 2x OT 12+ hours, along with getting covered for any personal makeup /tools you use.

These people who didn't get in the credits are probably just day players. Workers who only work 1 or a few days on the movie. Every movie/show has day players, from PAs to ADs, to hair, makeup, crafty, sfx, etc. when it's a big day, they hire extra people, and they usually don't make it into the credits.

Source: payroll, film stuff, experience &&Well, hopefully they're not undersexed too.&&And it's usually a whole company. They don't get the list of names in time, or someone forgets to email that company, or they ask for the list and the HR person from that company gets replaced, so the paperwork is lost.   

I'm sure it's quite easy to happen. Roll over to r/tifu to see normal people making stupid mistakes, or to r/talesfromtechsupport to see some examples of people working everyday jobs that sometimes are dense as bricks. The quality of the company doesn't come from not making mistakes, it comes from how they handle it after they do. &&Sequel already confirmed!&&I did some Special Effects work on Paddington and I didn’t get a credit and my work is in the film too.

I've found that it's all in the contract your vfx studio negotiates with the feature studio.   I've gotten credit on AAA movies I spent a day on, because the studio I was at negotiated credit placement.&&>  The bigger the movie, the more meaningless you are.

I am an audio engineer, and I work with lots of different bands. There's a fun, funky, pretty awesome band I know was approached by Disney to use one of their songs for one of the recent Pixar sequels.

Disney negotiated very hard: they convinced the band that having a song in a Pixar movie was really valuable, and so the band agreed to take a relatively small amount of money up front, something like $10k, with the idea being that all the publicity they get from the movie will make up for how little Disney wanted to pay. 

When the movie came out, turns out Disney had totally forgotten to put the band in the credits. Disney bought the song super-cheap with the promise of fame/exposure, and then 'forgot' to put the band in the credits.&&What the fuck is the deal with treating CG artists like shit? I'm not too familiar with the culture, but how hard is it to put a name on a list at the end of a movie?!&&That's the problem of your industry only existing after the Reagan era. Everyone hates unions now and thinks your right to start one is entitlement. People forget that Reagan himself had no problems with unions when he was in one, or when he was the head of one.&&As someone who knows what you great people do, and have friends who work doing incredible CG work, I want to let you know that you are awesome!

I am a semi retired IT guy, and I still wish to this day that I had the eye and the talent to manipulate software the way you guys do.  Yea, it's great I can fix just about any hardware issue, but my soul has always been hiding behind the desire to make Maya my bitch.

Hats off to you and all you wonderful software junkies.  I am and always will be in envy of your incredible talents.

&&I know someone who is an accountant who gets their name in the credits&&That's terrible. I was so impressed with the special effects in Bright, the people who made them definitely deserve all the credit for it.&&> They put HR of vfx companies before CG artists.

You can be damn sure it's because the HR people were in contact with them and made sure that they specifically made it into the credits.

There are notable exceptions, but 90% of HR employees do not care about their fellow humans.&&When ""we"" were the only game in town, my VFX employer would toss names in a hat and pull out a certain allotment. Guys that never stepped into the production office got credit. Others that were the sole support for an entire production got zip. Took years to get my name on a single pic. &&""Half hour long""

As an editor, I know full well that fast forward credits is a thing we can do. And double columns. And triple columns. Writing in the names is tedious, but I'd rather have all names squeezed in than have to tell someone that the list I received didn't have their name on it. &&> If they put the name of every VFX artist in the credits for a big budget film like Avengers or something, the credits would easily be a half hour long.

When Peter Jackson released the Lord of the Rings, he put the name of every single person in the Fan Club, in the credits. The credits on the extended cuts are ~40 minutes long each.

I, personally, don't have an issue with the credits getting longer or more informationally dense, to properly recognize the hard work of the artists...

&&This whole topic just makes me think of the credits on Pacific Rim, and how it was a good 10 minutes of a wall of names covering the screen.&&I was looking for a comment like this. I'm a production sound mixer (recording the sound on set). Luckily, I get credited most of the time (there have been three or four times I haven't been) but it's pretty frequent that they only credit me and not my boom operator or utility sound technician who are both extremely important members of my team. This is much more common than most people would think, unfortunately.&&I always thought it was because of union rules - that's why catering always gets credited, because they're union, while people in VFX or music who put in months of work often don't get credited, because they're not union. &&Truth.

If you want an EXCELLENT storyline based in that world, check out the game DragonFall.  Great writing in that title.

EDIT:  Capitalization errors.&&[deleted]&&I saw the dragon last night.  I made up my own backstory that it's someone's pet.&&What often happens is that the effects company is credited along with a handful of project leads.

The reasoning (spurious as it may be) is that crediting every single effects artist, CGI animator and such would add too much length to the credits&&Nah that was real.&&The centaur was one of my favorite bits. The fact that they mention The Army of the Nine Races but don't explain it or feel the need to show every race was also a favorite moment. They didn't sit there and explain it because in their world everyone knows. A lot of movies by the big studios don't give their audience this much credit. 

I have a few ideas on how I think they could have made the movie stronger, but it seems like there was less dumbing down for the general audience than most fantasy movies, and that's a positive step.&&Centaurs are real. The reason we don't recognize them is because they stand behind walls or fences and we mistake them for tall humans. &&it was a real centaur&&Excellent point! Kevin Smith has talked about that before on one of his podcasts (Similar situation with a animated movie in the news a year or two ago iirc) and he went on at length about the people who’s lives can be ruined by such a simple omittance and how it’s inexcusable after months of dedicated and usually exhausting work. 

And if you as a artist have been burned in this way by the company now, why would you return for any of the other Bright related projects they have been talking about wanting to make?&&If I had to guess, really competitive market.&&because (i'm assuming) the effects industry isn't unionized like acting, writing, and animating. this was why there was such an issue with the making of sausage party; they had production take place in canada where they don't have animators unions like they do in the states, resulting in poor working conditions and many folks leaving the project, only to have their names stripped from the credits despite having worked on over 2/3 of the film.&&Worked in the creative fields...

It's because there is always someone willing to do the work for less money. If I can't find a US based shop that will do the work for a price I find palatable, I can always look overseas. Plus there's always the specter of negative legal ramifications if your industry is accused of price-fixing.&&There is someone out there willing to do it for cheaper.&&They’ll just hire a bunch of people with little to no experience and it will suck.&&Studios are not using in house teams, but sub contracting. With the exception of two or three big players (ILM and WETA and prolly one other i don’t know) contracts go out on a bid. X number of effects shots for a fixed price. Then the subcontractor has to figure out the details and are constantly underbidding each other for “exposure”. The “classic” example is rhythm and hues, the house that did the academy award winning effect for Life of Pi. Talk about a movie that live and died by the CGI work.... they went bankrupt the day they won the award. 

Studios do this on purpose because they want the cheapest solution, and while artist have been trying to unionize, they have not been effective as there is always some one willing to do it cheaper, especially with the ability to have work done overseas. &&Because there is always a different cheaper option.&&There’s always a crew who is going take a job and do it for cheaper just to get work. If the studio can’t meet your wage demands, they’ll just find someone to do it cheaper. And there is no shortage of people in Hollywood/entertainment sector looking for work. &&I've also signed start packs that state you may not receive a credit depending on what the PM/HoD decides. I always get the credits anyway but it's in there to cover their asses for things like this&&This right here.

You're absolutely right, people like us are a dime a dozen. Unless we're above the line crew, and usually that still doesn't matter, we can be let go and replaced without hesitation.&&Yes, but they might just look for someone else. If they have reasons not to put someone in the credits now, they won't let themselves be pressured into doing it but instead would just look for replacement.&&Yeah knew the second I watched bright that all the critics i'd seen reviews from had been paid off.

It's not oscar material but it's a pretty good movie especially for a netflix original as opposed to a theater release.
&&I agree Jakoby had a good charter to start with but the whole blooded orc arc was weak. And then instant they said human bright I was like oh will Smith gon be a bright. And because they had so much world building to do there was a lot of exposition that felt unnatural as dialogue. &&All I learned was that I have a fetish for deranged clowns crossed dresses as nurses.&&I learned how to make a pencil disappear.&&That's a good way of looking at it. Thanks for a different perspective. I actually used to be a huge fan of theirs until I heard all of these things for myself. It was super disappointing to find out, mostly because the band sells this lifestyle experience where you get to feel like you're a part of something. It all feels very cult-ish. Now that I'm older, I've realized it's just a product, like everything else. I don't find his music inspiring anymore. &&Funnily enough, I liked it.

It avoided the usual ""Technobabble"" seen from many other shows that would be calling it *""Thaumaturgical Devices""* or *""Arcane Power-Rods""*. It was probably the ""street name"" and the MTF might use the aforementioned words, but we also need to remember that their world is very different to ours.

This is a world where magic doesn't mean a silly illusion with cards and boxes, it's a thing that kills people. Magic wands mightn't have the same childlike quality that we give them.

Magic wand only sounds silly because we associate it with fairy tales and magicians. This is a world where enough magic wands can bring people back from the dead, and people are willing to ***explode*** in order to find out that they have the ability to use them.

It's simple (Everybody watching knows what it is) and it doesn't sound like they're needlessly trying to sound smarter by using fancy words. &&Yeah I agree. Every worldbuilding done is some variation of:

Guy 1: ""Hey, do you know what happened with [INSERT RELEVANT CHARACTER OR PLOTLINE HERE]?

Guy 2: ""No, I don't. Ever since [INSERT VAGUE BACKGROUND TEASER HERE], I never got the full story.

Guy 1: Yeah man, it got ugly/wild/crazy. Jenkins told me [CUE DRAMATIC RIFF, INSERT FURTHER DETAIL ALONG WITH MOTIVES, TIMELINE, AND SENSE OF IMPENDING URGENCY].

Guy 2: [TURNS TO CAMERA] Got that?

&&When they enter the halfway house after the first shootout&&Netflix probably just uses softsubs.&&Credits and subs are different things and generally done by different teams of people. That said, since it's entirely a Netflix production I think you could grab an assistant editor to retype the credits and add some in, but you'd have to likely recompile and encode the entire movie for the credits fix. Which also means more work for the QA team because every new encode would have to be completely and thoroughly QCed. Subtitles are different because they're essentially a filter being applied to the movie that can be toggled on or off and into different languages. That doesn't require re-encoding the entire movie.

That said, they should absolutely do it anyway. It won't take minutes, but it also shouldn't take longer than a day. They also should be able to upload the new version and get it encoded in their system then just toggle a switch that redirects Bright links to the new file once it's ready, which would mean a minimal amount of service interruption for the movie itself. And, people who poured that much hard work into the movie absolutely deserves to be in the credits. Credit for a film is like a currency in that industry, plenty of people even do work for free just to be in credits (I don't recommend that, but it's done). So to take that away from people? Low blow.&&yup ahahahah! I mean, usually it's the people who make the film who asks their VFX companies working for them to put a certain amount of length in the credit, depending on how big their involvment in the movie's CG stuff they contributed. On a very recent big blockbuster film of the holidays, I was a bit disgusted by the fact that I knew some people who worked their ass off on it and they only had ONE LINE of credit mentioning the company as a whole...&&I studied to work in VFX through college and university, when I went to see some of the VFX houses in my country it was amazing and depressing at the same time. I felt like they'd made something fun and artistic very corporate. It turned me away from working in the film industry completely!

I now work in IT and do a few random bits and pieces to keep my practice up but I think I'd rather continue to be a hobbyist than work professionally in film.

Also [best scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka7l_QGtEZE) from The IT Crowd applies for VFX as well as it seems VFX is the lowest in the list to be remembered...&&When I watch movies I've worked on with my family, I always joke that ""the vfx guys are up, pay attention for the fluffer credits"" &&Caterers put in serious work and deserve credit&&Be fair, the caterers know their craft&&I can't say I've ever seen ""PorkRindSalad"" in a post movie credit.. &&You're missing a good opportunity to plug the band now.&&Why not bring that attention to the press?

So even in a blatantly obvious scam like this, Disney would still come out on top if there was a suit?&&I agree that that’s a shitty thing for them to have done. 

I have to say though, I’ve never heard a song I like in a movie, then waited for the credits to find out what it was. Google tends to be an easier option. &&how bout you give them that exposure now and tell us the band name and song?&&Why leave out the bands name now? &&Which one was it cause the most recent sequels, Dory and Cars, don't have a song that fits that criteria. Coco doesn't either so you're either confusing Disney with someone else or it's a lie.
&&Disney is an evil empire.  If you're surprised, you aren't paying attention.  ""sue us"" is a common tactic of large companies with large legal teams and no ability to even comprehend the concept of morality.  It's a favorite of Walmart as well.  They will constantly change the deal in ways that obviously violate the contract, and dare you to take them to court because you both know that they'll bankrupt you years before a final judgement is made.

Also, lmao at the idea of anyone being stupid enough to fall for ""do it for the exposure"".&&Name the band or you're full of shit.&&Let's hear it! Who were they??&&>band agreed to take 10k. 
  
>the band didn't get paid. 
  
So... Which is it then &&>  Turns out Disney had totally forgotten to put the band in the credits. 

That's pretty surprising, Disney is actually a company that is usually very good about inclusiveness in their credits. I mean...have you seen how long their credits list is? 

Can you tell us who the band is? &&It is like working in IT - 20-25 years ago, someone who could manage a server (or server farm) properly was fairly rare. These days they're (we're) a dime a dozen. As it is with VFX. What was once considered mysterious and companies could charge large amounts is now possible by many others (though not nearly as ubiquitous as IT of course) for cheap money.

VFX, like IT, is now one of those baseline things for films. People only really notice when it goes wrong and when it is done correctly, no one notices... think how similar all the big CGI films are these days - avengers, x men, transformers etc. The studios dont seem to care about individual flare or techniques.

It's also similar to video game companies. Now anyone can go make a flappy bird thing, companies like EA start paying less and less for more and more. And if you dont do it or dont accept that there will be no credit, they just go offshore or to another company that will.

Lowest bidder etc. Race to the bottom.&&The industry's problems mostly stem, from what I understand, from the way VFX work gets sub-contracted to the lowest bidder.&&Back in the day, we didn't need unions because we were making so much money. The VFX houses had a lot of power and decided not to collaborate and unionise - unlike set builders and caterers and every one else. Once VFX work became commoditised, all the power shifted to the big 6 and everyone got fucked. So now we win Oscars and go bankrupt in the same month. &&Iron Man Three (2013) had over 3700 people in the credits from 24 special-effects companies - 7 full minutes scrolling text and still many are uncredited. &&Theaters will never want an additional 40 minutes for credits, too much overlap on already lengthy movies.&&That’s because Guillermo Del Toro is a man that cares about his crew and will acknowledge that without them the movie would not have been made. &&Iron Man 3 had fake credits added in.&&I'm a sound utility person, and my dad is a boom operator. We hardly ever get credits! We are working on the same show now, and we did get a credit on a recent episode as ""Production Staff"". My dad, who has been doing this for 30 years, said it was his only credit in the past 10 years. 

It would be nice to get a credit. I'm noticing it a little more on features. Maybe that practice will trickle down to tv as well. &&It’s part of the caterers deal memo to receive credit. As is the case with virtually everyone in the credits. &&I'd think the purpose of credits would be for primary roles so you'd know who they were and can maybe find other works by them.  Listing all these other names is completely useless to that purpose.  I'm sure it's just grown over the years because more and more people negotiated and complained that they were just as important as X so they deserve to have their name in the credits and studios gave in because it was a cheap thing to add.  Really it just made credits more useless and people less likely to read them though as they grew.&&Why wouldn't/couldn't this work like it does in most other industries?  Accountants and truck drivers seem to find progressive employment based on past experience without credits.&&Yes, and people do. &&>nice uncredited costume designers finish last

&&I think everyone who is outraged enough to comment which forced Netflix to change the credits should be  in the credits.&&>Clauses

Like the guy who fell off my roof last night?&&I knew there was a sequel planned, but three? If they're all as decent as the first, I'll be pleasantly surprised. I hope so, anyway. Maybe they'll even get better.&&Kinda wish it was a TV series &&Hell yeah. I heard people shitting on it and was disheartened but this is great news!&&Definitely did.  Wearing riot gear.  Amazing.&&There is also one guarding the checkpoint in the very beginning when they cut through elf town&&Also a reptilian on a cross walk sign in the opening credits, mention of dwarves, (I kinda think the magic fed with the elf was a dwarf) and whatever the girl with sideways blinking eyes was.

Since shield of light crazy mentions how the army of 9 races fought the Dark Lord I was trying to figure out what those races where. &&Similar to Shadowrun but not the same. In Bright, humans and magic creatures lived together since the beginning of time instead of the magic creatures coming around at a certain point.&&Not based on SR. But seems to be heavily inspired from it. Shadowrun meets Bad Boys, meets Cast a Deadly Spell.&&It's not, it's set in a contemporary timeline rather than Cyberpunk, and there wasn't ever any goblinization or lull in magic between ages; every race has always existed. It's very similar in a lot of ways, though - elves rule the world as rich elites because they're elves, humans are just sort of everywheres, and orcs tend to be shoved into ghettos. Magic's extremely rare, with maybe one in a million humans being able to use it.

*As an edit, because I forgot the first time; Dragonfall is great, Hong Kong has an even more polished setup - though I think I prefer Dragonfall's story and setting more. The original Shadowrun Returns isn't too bad either, really, though it was more a proof of concept and Deadman's Switch isn't particularly lengthy.*&&No, Shadowrun doesn't have a monopoly on the concept of Tolkein fantasy inserted into modern human society. 

In Shadowrun, magic and all those fantasy elements came back after being gone for a long time while in Bright, humans, orcs and elves have coexisted since pretty much forever.&&as noted.  nah, this isn't Shadowrun.  this is End of Watch meets lord of the rings.  Way more fantasy, in a modern urban enviroment.  While shadowrun is eldergod fantasy in a sci-fi cyberpunk world.

More Dark mage, and less Secret societies etc. Hard to articulate the exact points. But, ""The secret world"" for example would be Shadowrun set in the 90-2000. This isnt that.&&You could call Max Landis many things; subtle isn't one of them.&&But credits are long anyway, and isn't 'crediting the artists' their entire purpose?  If they're going to credit every dude holding a light in place and the food catering, they should be crediting any artist who's work made it to the screen.  &&Coo, off to look for Narnia..&&It was a half-centaur&&the john wick approach

show you whatever the fuck they want, leave the rest to mystery&&I want to know what public toilets look like in a world where Centaurs exist. &&I enjoyed it having played games and or watched other movies of the sort but my parents and siblings who weren't as into what I was were lost by it and lost interest. Still a good movie in my eyes.&&I was shocked it didn't do the whole explain the universe at the start that most movies would do&&I've always hated the way movies awkwardly explain relationships. I've never in my life called my sister ""little sister"" or said ""as you know."" There has to be a better way.&&My god, that neighbor on Home Improvement.... the whole time?!&&Wilson?&&Gary Oldman sewed himself to a real horse for the role.&&You need the work, either for the money or the promise of future credits or both.&&Nailed it

In the 1980s had a family friend that worked as an cell animator for a non Disney house. The companies tried to demand more money and almost over night the entire industry got out sourced to Korea.
&&Same reason actors put up with a lot of the harassment from people in power. They're easily replaced because everyone wants to do that job.&&As someone doing vfx animation for about 14 years now: yes.   Places in the US are competing against places in Canada who get government subsidies (tax breaks) to make fx work cheaper, and folks in Canada are competing against folks overseas who have cheaper labor and a better exchange rate, etc.&&Yeah, there's a lot of people who I personally know who made this their dream job. Lots of talent from this generation entering the field now. &&I work parallel with the industry often and it's basically that there are very few big studios that pay for big budget studio VFX stuff. So they have the VFX studios by the balls since there's always someone that'll work for cheaper. That means the top shelf VFX studios are on a razors edge bidding as low as possible to get the few available jobs. There's been talk of unionizing but that'd take industry wide consensus which would be very difficult. 

On top of all that some countries give tax subsidies to do the VFX work there which means the LA based companies have to move just to compete on project bids. It's a mess. Eventually too the India and Asia based studios that were trained by Hollywood artists are going to catch up skill wise (they're already close) and then what's gonna happen when they'll do the work for pennies on the dollar?&&Not just the men, but the women and children too!&&Hmmmm, if only everyone came together and made that same request. Almost if they were forming a unified effort or a team of sorts.... There must be a name for that.&&that's awful. asking for a contract should not be a death sentence for your job/gig/career. &&I was kind of hoping Jackoby would be the bright since they didn't bring up anything about orcs being brights.&&I had that nailed down pretty well when I saw the title and Will Smiths face plastered on the front of the movie. Literally almost every movie with the main character on the front is gonna be chosen or special in some way, with specific regard to this type of genre. It's a surprise to me, that it comes as a surprise to anyone that it hasn't been figured out before the movie even starts.

 The point of this pedantry is that critiquing this movie to bring light to the fact that it was a trope to have our main character become the chosen hero is such a weak argument. it tells you from the imagery and title exactly who Will Smiths character is. You don't have to watch the movie to know that. Most fantasy movies fall into the same trope, Bright isn't an exception in the least. If that bothered me, then I wouldn't have watched it to begin with.&&Agreed. I mean, there's other stories about Leto that make me dislike him.&&Also, when they return, the body is still smouldering.&&Shit. It's got hardcoded Kor subs. I'm going to wait for the blue ray rip.&&You misunderstood me. If you watch Netflix sometimes after the movie a second roll of credits will roll as a separate video for the voice cast of different dubs. This isn't part of the video encoded of the film, it is separate.&&I've seen my name in the credits on the big screen - because I had a membership in the Lord of the Rings Fan Club so when they re-released the Extended Editions in theater for the Hobbit premier, they used the Extended DVD cut - which had all the names.

It's likely VFX artists were left off, but at least I was on there!&&Yep,  this is common.  Or the movie will give the vfx co. a max of 20 names that very to be credited and they get to decide who those guys are.  This is also common with people who day play or work the reshoots. They aren't going to credit the gaffer of the reshoots even if he works 2-4 weeks. &&I can relate from a different industry. I work construction management and we managed the construction of this big lab complex that utilized state money for a university. They had a ribbon cutting not long after we finished. Some of the state legislatures are there, the university big wigs, etc. I mentioned to my boss that I was looking forward to some recognition for a job well done for our company and he let me know not to get my hopes up too high. Well, the ceremony goes on, the state reps are patting themselves and the university on the back the whole time, and not once was our company even mentioned during the entire hour ceremony. My boss later told me, these ceremonies aren't for us, they're for the state legislature and university to gloat and recognize their own awesomeness to the papers.

I literally bled for that building. I understand the confusion and hurt of not even getting mentioned when the credits start rolling. &&When he complimented Roy for his contributions at the vending machine and Roy started crying, I lost it laughing my ass off.

It's sad that you would be turned off from your dream by the reality of how the industry works. I know a lot of people I went to university with that felt the same way by the time they were finishing school. It would be great if people could be exposed to the good and the bad realities before spending 4 years of time and money on an education for that career path.&&> I felt like they'd made something fun and artistic very corporate.

This is why I got out of the games industry, too. It's fucking depressing.&&Big fan of your work and methods.&&>movies I've worked on with my family

So it's a family business, huh?&&They need just desserts. &&That's because nobody reads porn credits, even AAA ones. Look for The Fluffer to find PorkRindSalad. &&Looking pretty fake at the minute.&&I'm sure we could figure it out...I mean how many fun, funky bands could there be in Portland?&&Don't forget the power of bullshitting on the internet. Not that it necessarily is, but without actual proof be weary of joining a hate wagon too soon. &&Thats like asking a Mafia snitch to ""just go to the press."" Sure, you might get a headline but then you got the scariest studio in town angry at you. And Disney acts like MS13 more than Mickey Mouse. They got a long memory and know how to hold a grudge.

You don't fuck with the mouse. 

Source: Work in the film game. &&Because unless you're a huge band, you won't get attention in the press, you'll lose the lawsuit, and it'll cost you *way* more than it's worth.&&Just wondering, do Disney actively suppress news stories like this?&&Why not mention the band name too?&&You still gotta sue and that takes time and money.&&Pretty sure it was a made up story. Disney would have an iron clad contract in place. If they didn't the band could sue them for using the song.&&They probably did. But Disney knows they're not going to sue them. They're not going to risk their time and already small amount of money just to go into a year long legal battle with the largest media company in the world. It's suicide.

I work freelance and I've been put in situations like this before. The larger the company, the higher chance they're going to fuck you. They just don't give a shit and they have no reason to.&&I guess their lawyers could just drag it out, and bankrupt a civilian before that. It's easier to just let go, in their vision&&I mean, google probably gets the answer from someone who did read the credits&&But then it'd be easy to prove the story is bullshit.&&It's literally an inside joke in the film industry

""Freelancer has died on the Oregon Trail due to .....Exposure""&&I had this argument with my girlfriend's family once. They love Disney, Disneyland, Disney World, they have Disney mugs, they watch the behind the scenes on the rides. They looked at me like I had suggested we start doing satanic rituals in the basement or something.  
  
Disney is fucking scary big, they have control over a metric fuckton of properties, and just got even more when they bought out Fox. I mean, it's hard to argue the point with people who haven't thought about it, because ""Disney, don't they just make princess movies?"" They control what feels like half of new movies now, which is ridiculous&&also the name of the movie. and when the song can be heard. &&It doesn’t help that big names like Andy Serkis try to paint the picture that mocap does all the work nowadays and that VFX artists do very little.

Edit: His comments were also poorly timed. It was really close to the awards season when VFX artists were on strike for archaic workers’ rights and for the fact that Life of Pi animators were not paid for their work on a movie that won a ton of visual awards that that awards ceremony.&&Essentially if you are running a studio, you have very high fixed costs.  Very high end hardware, software licences, premises (rent, electricity etc) and a core number of permanent staff.  You cannot afford to have staff hanging around doing nothing. 

So, you bid for a job because you need the work to pay for those ongoing costs.  Disney then talks to company B who has underbid you by a little.  Then Disney comes back to you, so you bid lower.  This repeats until you either win the bid or ""lose"".

Also, these bids are often done with little knowledge of the amount or complexity of the shots locked down.  So you bid, then you find out you have to create Optimus Prime fighting a T-Rex in the ocean on another planet and there is no clause in the contract limiting the number of revisions the client asks for.

Rinse and repeat as another VFX house goes under...&&They could at the very least put it on the dvd.&&Yeah I see now why he bailed on The Hobbit movies.&&Damn, hope nobody got forgotten off those credits, that would be a real kick in the dick.&&Why?&&It does work. Potential employers in the film industry dont look at that stuff most of the time, anyway. They would view the person's reel and make a decision based on that or get recommendations from other producers about hiring people. 

Having credits officially listed is just nice IMO. I've worked really hard on film projects just to have them spell my name wrong in the credits and that burns. But the only time it's been to my benefit to show someone IMDb or my name in the credits is when i show it to people who don't work in the industry. &&Because unlike other industries you can't as easily call up a reference. If you only did a day of makeup on set even though it may have been a long day a future studio can't call up the key makeup artist because chances are they wont remember you.

Also people put fake credits on IMDB all the time so that (uncredited) mark can really fuck you up.&&the virgin uncredited costume designer vs the chad credited costume designer&&Put me in the screenshot.&&But that's outrageous!&&We are all in the credits on this blessed day.&&Just don’t put on the suit and you should be fine.&&Yeah this movie was a big surprise for me. Not the best movie the year but way better than I expected. I was blown away by Edgerton. All it took was an orc costume for him to show some real range.

Edit: not saying that Edgerton doesnt have range. Just that this role was a huge departure for him and he nailed it.&&i'll be happy if its just below being on par with the first one if it explains things alittle better  
  
&&That's the feeling I got. It tried to pack too much world building into a movie. Worked have worked great as maybe a mini-series as an intro to the world or something.&&Shit, I thought it was a tv series. Dammit.

Such an interesting concept ripe for expansive world building and... two hours? &&That's how I felt. The first half was awesome, the second half felt like they were trying shoehorn events to fit lines from the first half. 

It really needed to be longer to tell the story properly. 

EDIT: still found it very enjoyable. &&It's probably too expensive for that. Both the cost of Will Smith and the  cost of sfx. Netflix is loaded but not give-Will-Smith-a-fantasy-cop-show loaded.&&Same. Saw some memes shitting on it, then my girlfriends dad turns it on during Christmas Eve. I expected it to be terrible but kept quiet... was super invested in the entire thing. Great movie. We all liked it a lot. Turns out you can trust people who make memes... who knew! &&Humans

Orcs 

Elves

Pixie

Centaur

Dwarves

Reptilian

Halfling  (Gnome). There was a very short person at a crosswalk at some point. 

??&&Also, no Matrix (Augmented Reality and Graphical Computer Interfaces i.e. ""Jacking in""), no CyberWare (Mechanical replacement limbs, eyes, organs, etc that work better than the original, but at a cost) and no general upgrades in technologies (no drones, self-driven vehicles or remote piloted vehicles), militarization of general society or corporations as de facto nation-states OR breakdown of the traditional nation-states - all of which are key points in the *Shadowrun* mythos. Additionally, Magic itself is much more common in the *Shadowrun* setting than in the *Bright* universe, as the spells demonstrated in the movie would have equivalents that any Street Shaman or Spell Chucker in the Shadows could do in his sleep.

Personally, I'd love to see a *Shadowrun* series on Netflix - because I don't think you could do it any other way *than* a series on Netflix, too much too unpack plot-wise. But, here's hoping... chummers. ;)&&In Shadowrun it happens in Cycles. The Awakening happens and then  people forget after some time and then all the magical creatures go to sleep. Then something triggers another Awakening. &&Also not cyberpunk dark future.  Still, as well as I could have expected given the setting.&&It felt more like shadowrun meets training day, meets Colors&&>	Cast a Deadly Spell

That's new to me. I'm going to have to check it out now!&&No, its just Alien Nation with orcs and shit. &&Dont forget a bit of Alien Nation thrown in.&&Magic in shadowrun is also one person in a million, but with a world population in the high hundreds of billions that's a lotta mages. And remember,  GEEK THE MAGE FIRST. &&They should but that isn’t how it works unfortunately. Effects company 1 says “we’ll provide effects for $X per day but insist that you credit every member of our team who worked on the project” between the logistics staff, payroll and other admin staff in addition to the roughly 60 artists plus that one guy who covered for Julie because she was sick one day and the ten other people who only did one day for that massive crowd shot you’re probably adding 100+ names to the credits and adding let’s say one minute to the length of the movie.

Company two says “we’ll charge $Y per day and ask that you credit the company and the project leads” which adds maybe six names and negligible time to the credits. The Y amount could even be more and if it comes out cheaper than the cost of additional music and the lost revenue from people who would be put off by the longer length of the movie (because yes people do look at the run time and decide if they can be bothered to go to the cinema or not) then company 2 always gets the contract.

It sucks and it’s bad for the artists but it’s been that way for so long now. Think about the oscars does the best makeup award go to the individual artist or the make up supervisor?&&I'm just glad to see Hollywood providing more acting opportunities for centaurs.&&So ¼ horse?&&That's not really quite how it works.

Haven't seen Bright yet, but in John Wick, they very carefully choose what they mention and don't show to effectively build the atmosphere and sense of world and backstory. Too gung-ho a stance towards this leads to a world just feeling incomplete and poorly put together, or perhaps a world that feels obsessed with its lore but incapable of effectively communicating it. It takes time, effort, and consideration to do this right. &&I too, am surrounded by simpletons

stay woke&&Twist: the horse was actually Christian Bale acting like a horse. &&Not only are there tons of people that want the job but a lot are willing to do the job cheaper than the guy they're replacing.&&And some of the working animals. Lassie got mad tail.&&is it possible to learn this power?&&This is a country (and Hollywood is one of the worst places) where filing a sexual harassment lawsuit can kill your career. It's completely fucked up.&&You can critique lazy writing. The emotional character arc was with Jakoby, will smith's character didn't do much to be chosen. It was like the movie had two hero's but couldnt commit to either one. The movie did a really good job with world building (minus the exposition) and technical effects. 

My main problem was the two lead characters arcs not complementing each other. One character is abused and accepted by no one; he strives to be something better and at the end gains acceptance from one of the peoples who shunned him. The other character is an asshole albeit not an evil asshole who is racist and gets magic at the end because? It felt like the movie was supposed to be about Jakoby, but because will Smith was in it they made him the other main character. 

&&Not just smoldering, was still on fire! &&Somewhere in Iceland my character name in eve online is etched into a marble statue lol&&Hey I was on Clerks 2 because of similar shenanigans, lol.&&They put fan club names into The Hobbit credits? Why? &&I think one of my main gripes is that a lot of entry level jobs for vfx (roto and cleanup) which could have been a good place to start are now outsourced to cut costs. 

The course i did had too many disciplines and didnt allow me to practice what I really wanted to do, pile that on to having to work almost full time to meet lifestyle needs - i had no time left to create portfolio work that was worth submitting in a reel.

My friend and I are now doing some game creation stuff using a lot of 3D and vfx techniques that carry over, its just a hobby for us now and I feel happy abput that! 

The reality of creatives is a sad one unfortunately; if you want to create from your own mind you need time or money or both...so working on other peoples visions is the answer to money but that leaves little time to work on your own ideas. In the end you either outgrow your ambitions or you work until you have no passion left for a job you used to love.

Not always the case but ive seen it often enough through my uni years and now that im in work!&&Disney releases sound tracks for pretty much every movie. Even if the band didn’t get credit in the film itself they’d surely be on the soundtrack? &&That's a horrible band name.&&Annnnnd he's gone.&&So what are you saying, everyone should just bend over and take it from the mouse and their shorty antics?&&>Bring that attention to the press

>Lose the law suit

These are two comoletely different things my friend&&All mega corps do especially ones that boast the happiest place on earth&&eh, he's a big chunk of why The Hobbit movies are the movies they are. He quit production after he got tired of sitting around because of studio financial issues.

 Peter Jackson absolutely didn't want to direct, but after GDT left, he decided it was either he stepped in to direct or the studio would get some for hire schlub and they'd be just abhorrent. PJ asked the studio to delay the release to give him more pre-production time to retool the films to his personal style and they refused. PJ started production with basically nothing and had to do everything on the fly. It's why you have things like CG orcs, or loads of compositing, they just flat out didn't have the time to do it any other way. There is footage of PJ sitting on set with just the most depressed look and stare on his face because he was so overwhelmed.

Frankly, it's a testament to PJ's immense skill as a filmmaker that the films were even watchable.&&TIL there were fake credits on IM3?&&The producers thought it would be funny.  They knew we'd be waiting for the end so they drug it out to dick with us.  They listed everyone who worked on the movie, everyone who wanted to work on the movie and then they made up some fake positions and sprinkled them in as well. &&Would someone working one day on set really expect their name in the credits?

If anything, hold on to your W-9 or whatever to show you got paid for the work you did. Better yet, if you’re a makeup artist, document before and after pictures of the talent you’re making-up. Have a portfolio of your experience, it’s better than word of mouth. 

Plus, don’t know how things work in Hollywood, but in the real world, it’s pretty rare for someone to verify every claim made about past employment history anyway. 

You’re either qualified, or you’re not. Someone will find out soon enough. &&It’s unfair! &&Truly, truly outrageous! &&Honestly though, fuckin Nick. He was great. I want to buy him a beer, or whatever the orc equivalent is. &&he has a wide range of movies that show pretty incredible range. notably:
- The Gift
- Midnight Special
- It Comes At Night&&Yeah this is great news. They created this huge world with a lot of open ends, it would be such a shame to let it die off.  I love the concept, It’s like shadowrun with out the cyber punk and able to explore real world issues at the same time. &&Agree. Seems there’s a big difference between how critics have reviewed the film and the general audience. &&I just saw this last night, and while the theme was rather ham fisted the world itself was pretty damn cool. &&[deleted]&&It's great surprisingly enough.  Such poor reviews though.  Pro critics seem out off touch sometimes.&&He was so good in It Comes at Night.&&The movie really felt like it was made for sequels/prequels.  I imagine the next one will be awesome.&&Clearly Netflix wants Bright to be a new series, and I don't blame them. &&This will be the third or fourth time I've said on reddit, I want bright to be Netflix's extended universe. &&I was saying the same thing. I originally thought it was going to be a stranger things style 8 episode series with hour long episodes. Would've been so down for that. Still enjoyed what I got.&&As much as I tend to like will smith's ""sarcastic guy"" roles, I would have liked it better it they had used someone else (let's be honest, anyone could play that role) and made it into a series that really showed the depth and history of the world building. I was much more intrigued by what was going on in the background than I was with our two main characters.

Also, did the orc guy's ears wiggle from time to time or was I imagining things? &&Netflix could do it Rated R too. I don't need violence, harsh language, and sexuality in everything, but a dystopian shithole world like Shadowrun definitely calls for it.&&> no Matrix

...yet&&I definitely started thinking about training day when I watched it and SPOIIIIIIIIILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS the cops started planning to kill Nick.&&It's tongue in cheek film noir urban fantasy with a touch of Lovecraft. If you like Bright and you enjoy Shadowrun, you'll dig it.&&I understand why that is, but it detracts from the artistic integrity of their business.  Artists have nearly always been critically underpaid for their work in every industry, and that proof of exposure is what they strive for.  

Art school is expensive and this subject just gets me riled up haha&&I've heard they can be very hard to work with. Always acting like they're the centaur of the universe.&&I see where you're coming from, and agree, but I was just being flippant for the sake of comedy&&No matter what the cost.

You know Weinstein wasn't the only one that would give out roles if you showed him some... Special consideration.&&And with exact or better set of skills&&Not from a Jedi &&I'll give you that for sure. Will Smiths magnetic star power kept stripping the camera from Jakobys glorious orc face. His arc was the best, though still weak. The plot device they use to complete his arc to become blooded? 

Fuck it, kill him off, and bring him back to life, that'll show the audience he has real balls.&&I was a dumbass and used my IRL name as my ingame name. so now my actual legal name is on that statue lmao&&And Xenuria's isnt XD&&[deleted]&&Found mine, R3,C17,R33  I was in Iceland in March and never thought to look myself up&&2004 account here.  And I'm not on it, because I briefly won at Eve for 2 years and this happened during that period.  I did succumb and go back, but I've now been clean for a while again.&&Lmao how?&&Mine is too!

It better be there when i'm long dead and serve as a memorial to me!&&o7

So it ended up on the screen that way.

Howard Shore had to record an additional 15 minutes of credit music for it IIRC, the names were packed in tight, too.&&I’m in a completely different field, but I also work a full time job so I can do what I originally wanted to do on the side. It isn’t what I originally imagined, but I’m happy, and that’s what matters in the end I suppose.

Lots of background music gets left out&&Not at all. Im saying you have to treat the mouse like you would treat an illegal crime syndicate, not a typical business.

Say you do go against the mouse. You get a BuzzFeed article going about how Disney does Negative thing A. It gets traction and you get some buzz. Disney puts out a statement along the lines of: ""We are sorry to LiamGTR and all the other VFX artist that didn't get credit.We will take steps in the future. 

Great, you think, I made a difference. Next day you find out that your VFX company's contract was just canceled and all its other bids are going nowhere. Everyone in the office looks at you. Layoffs happen (normal for the industry but they always hire you back, except this time). 

You look for work at another house but for some reason, no one seems to want to work with you. You think to yourself, ""is a company as big as Disney really going out of its way to blackball me? I mean all I do is animate hair! I'm a nobody. Is Disney really that petty?""

The answer: YES! 

Disney will destroy your world and then some. They own half of the Hollywood market share for a reason. They sue little food trucks that have star wars puns as their name into oblivion (look up Grillenium Falcon). 

It is like dealing with the mob. You can make noise but Disney has more teeth than you and when they bite they don't let go until they see arterial blood. The Mouse is scary. &&Yes. It's happening right now.&&They added fake names to make the people waiting for the after credits scene wait longer.&&If this is real then that makes me happy. &&How can you be in a movie and not be in its credits?&&Grog. &&Grog?

Like seriously? We live in a time where 10 super hero movies come out each year and a shadowrun style buddy cop movie is derivative? Come on.

But I guess that guy only saw one movie this year anyways so. &&[deleted]&&The biggest reviewer complaint I saw was the lack of a character background for the villain.  They didn't understand WHY she was doing it, or what her motivation was.  Watching it, and I've had this thought a lot when I see that complaint in a review, all I could think was that I didn't care what her reason was.  She didn't need to have one, maybe she was just someone who wanted to mess some shit up.  Maybe she had the hots for the darklord, all I needed to know was the good guys had something she wanted and she was going to do very bad things to them to get it back. &&I said this to my wife.

I think the weather balloon or whatever it was on didn't make it though&&Just so you know, that wasn't an actual re-release of those movies. When theaters do those ""watch all of X before you watch the new one!"" they are literally using those blu-rays, which is why you saw your name. Now that the projectors are digital you can hook up a blu-ray player to it and play whatever you want. The movie studios charge a relatively modest licensing fee in those situations.

We'll have to see what spin Reynolds does on the voice, but I imagine it will be something similar.

It's a lot different than the Pikachu talking in the I Choose You movie, which while evidently a sort of deathbed hallucination for Ash was still meant to be a more accurate representation of what Pikachu would sound like speaking.&&that has potential to be the greatest thing ever created.&&I can't tell if you're joking.

Btw, a lot of those 900 episodes are non-manga-canon fillers and due to >1-parters, so the actual caseload is a lot smaller and most of the episodes that completely fuck up the timeline are fillers anyway. But even with that the timeline still makes no sense though. But who cares, the main story is just insanely good.&&How many Halloween episodes have the Simpsons had? How long have the Southpark kids been in school? I can’t think of a cartoon series that has ever had their characters grow up in real time. That’s one of the benefits honestly. One of the kids doesn’t suddenly hit puberty and you have to fast-forward the show 2 years. Most things in cartoons don’t make sense, that’s why they’re animated.

Actors are able to use facial capture sets like digital puppets, translating their smallest facial movements and ticks onto a polygonal model. While those same movements could hypothetically be hand-animated, it's more authentic for the performer to do it themselves.

The actor is playing an active role in bringing the character to life, rather than just providing the voice. This is also why Reynolds was cast prior to shooting, instead of after shooting (like in many similar films. Geoffrey Rush was infamously cast in Green Lantern only a matter of weeks before the film actually released, since he just needed to read lines for a pre-animated character.). They need him to actually perform to create the character.&&That's not a nice thing to say about Cumberbatch&&*scale* problem&&But the results would be hilarious, because I’m imagining them kinda superimposing (don’t know if that’s the best word to use here) his face onto the costume, kinda like annoying orange, but with his whole face instead of just eyes and noise.&&Or they could take turns.&&Why the fuck did it say the same thing the second time around? &&Also a doctor, Doctor Mantis Toboggan.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0qZTS38cjw&&Man I wish I could have recorded the crowd in the theater when Yoda pulls out his lightsaber in AotC.

That whole family is pretty great to be quite honest.   &&I read that she was responsible for shorning down a lot of Tarantino's more indulgent scenes, with his permission of course. She and Tarantino had a perfect balance between her editing instincts and his pure cinematic enthusiasm.&&I'll still of the mind that she was more important to the greatest of Tarantino's find then people realize.

TIL&&> I imagine editing is tedious as hell

It can be, but it's also a hugely creative and important part of the process. A movie's written three times -- on the page, in the performance, and in the edit. You can accomplish so much with effective editing, and it can be a super enjoyable process. 

But there are other times when it's tedious as all fuck. Depends on what the project is, who you're working with, what point in the project you're at, etc.
&&It did. Best real American editor, Tommy Wiseau&&9/10&&The details are grisly. &&Just processing dailies really. &&I worked for a company called Fotokem that chemically processed the 70mm film and then I received the scans of each frame, synched the sound, labeled each take with the necessary metadata (scene/take, shoot day/date, camera info), and then transcoded the scans into all the deliverable formats. Editorial media, dvds for Quentin, streamable video files for producers, etc.&&Not op, but in the same line of work. When films are shot on traditional photochemical film, the good takes get developed overnight to watch the next day. Them be the dailies. &&Processing dailies &&Yeah. It was an overhead shot in the barn and I got the impression they were saying it directly to her in heaven and less to the camera.&&My grandmother was a film editor for Walt Disney in the late 1940s and 1950s as part of an all female team. Interesting work in an interesting time period. &&Incredible how both integral and trivial things can seem&&> Heard the older generation are more commonly women because back in the day editing film was viewed as being like sewing so it became a woman’s job.

That was in the silent era. In 1927 sound came along and from then on it was more of a technical job, so obviously only men could do it.&&Not the op but I thought the last 20 or so minutes dragged. It felt weird that there was a shootout at candyland, Django gets captured, escapes and there's another shootout in that short span of time. Also Tarantinos part should've been cut out haha&&It's not that people don't like it, it's just that you can see the difference. &&>What did you not like?

Nothing. 

The editing was just different.&&Hateful 8 felt 30 minutes too long for me, I didnt hate it but it felt like it dragged a lot. &&Wasn't it like his 2nd worst received movie ever? &&Neither of those has Robert De Niro smoking a bong though.&&I do the same.

I have AS too, and that was cool to randomly see (sorry for being weird lol). Hope you’re still symptom free and Happy Holidays! :) &&I forgot Mike Myers was in that!&&Well I totally fucked that up.

God damnit!  Say hello to Sally next time you ungrateful bastard!


Ah well I... fuck me.  Hello Sally!&&Was that Mike Myers?? &&Yeah I was watching the start of Jackie Brown again the other day and the editing is brilliant as Pam Grier walks through the airport &&Honestly I think that's a bit overstated. I loved Django and it did feel *just* slightly out of focus from his previous stuff but I'm not sure it's all on the editing. Django was originally a 240 page screenplay I believe and he cut down the script down significantly to not make it 4 hours long. 

I think that's why it seemed slightly out of focus, even with the extremely high quality I think the final cut had. &&I noticed that the editing has changed while watching Django and then after I went to look up what's going on and learned the whole story of Sallys unfortunate hiking accident.

And I am no movie afficionado either, but I still could tell rather quickly that something was off about the editing just from having seen all Tarantino movies.&&The hateful 8 felt like a different but more purposefully edited movie than Django &&> I mean it was pretty damn clear that when Django was released how truly important she was to help clearly present Tarantino’s visions for their films. Django certainly felt like a bit of the cohesiveness that is typical in his films was lost

Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of problems with Django, specifically it's length, but, I'm not sure what aspects come down to the editor, since it can vary incredibly from director to director. Did she have Tarantino's ear for cutting scenes? Or is it more likely the case of Tarantino writing a script that is just a bit sloppier or wider-scoped. 

Like, to me, Tarantino's best work is Inglorious Basterds because of how tight it is. And the individual scenes are very well-edited, but, also the structure as a whole is very tight which is due the way it's written (it's a movie of very few scenes, to the point where you could probably do it as a stage play), in a way that Django felt like it needed a pruning in the script stage moreso than in the editing booth. 

I'm not indicating anything either way. She was clearly a very talented editor (take that bar scene in Inglourious Basterds, where you have like 6 different actors playing off of each other), I'm just not 100% sure on whether we can account the lack of cohesion in Django and even Hateful Eight to the editor's end, or Tarantino's writing become looser and more overindulgent. But having said that, it's equally plausible that both movies could've ended up far tighter with her work on it. 

So, I guess what I'm saying, is .. that .. I don't know what I'm saying. Just that it is very hard to break down stuff like this in filmmaking, because of the way collaboration works.&&That might be it. I loved Django but I felt like it just missed something that should've been holding it together. 

Editors are woefully underappreciated. Just think - Suicide Squad was apparently not terrible before the editors got their hands on it. &&Hiking accident.&&I was going to add. The fight and the dog scenes really fuck with me in a way as an adult that the heroin scene did in pulp fiction when I was 9 and I was left alone with the wrong movie. 

..I thought it was going to be about orange juice.&&Damn straight I did&&I'd like to imagine you'd be like: ""Oh, look at Fakezaga, they can't stop farting! Fart Fart Fart with every step. Oh that last one's a little wet.""&&“Curse my laziness!” I’ve heard that one too many times. &&They do if it's 113 degrees or more&&You’ve clearly never been to the southeast US. Sure the sun is hot, but when the air is at 90% humidity and thick as honey on top of that, you enter a different level of HOT&&Unless you want to have a heat stroke on the way to work.&&Would you want to drive in an oven for 5 minutes?&&Likely meant start it so that the AC kicked on and cools the interior&&In direct sunlight, your car can get 40 degrees hotter than the air around it. So in 113 degree weather, in direct sunlight, your car could get to 150 degrees. That's egg cookin' hot. Oof&&Absolutely. Come live in Georgia where the humidity is nuts and it's 100 degrees. You need to blast the AC for about 5-10 minutes or so before getting in, especially if you have leather seats! We don't always do it, but when time permits, it is glorious. 

I can only imagine how horrible the dry heat of the Southwest must be. Because the humid heat of the Southeast will really drain you. &&Haha, yeah! Tropical climate means heat + humidity. That makes car temperature inside SUPER high and impossible to be in. 

Remote start helps in cold and hot weather. If you don’t have it, you have to go and turn the car on and blast the AC (instead of the heater).&&It hits 115 every summer where I live, so yes&&Yeah, in South Texas, the car can be so oppressively hot you really don’t want to stay in it until the a/c can start to cool.&&In Texas, the inside of your car, given the right conditions, can easily surpass the external temp. If it's in the high 90s I definitely try to let my a.c. kick in before getting inside.&&What the fuck are you talking about? Have you never heard of an air conditioner?&&Can confirm. Live in south Texas. During the summer, I have to warm up my car or else the seats and steering wheel actually burn my skin. Lol&&I didn't know people heated them up when I was young (am Indian) &&Remote start on my car is one of my favorite features. If it's under 40F outside the car starts, kicks on the heater, and activates the heated seats. If it's warm it'll do the opposite. It turns on A/C and kicks on cooled seats.

In summer at the end of the work day I remote start my car from my phone. In the 3-4 minutes it takes to get from my desk to my car it's nice and comfy. Outside temp might be 105F but inside the car is a reasonable 75-80F already.

Also, tinted windows as dark as is legal all the way round helps. 5%/limo tint on all windows behind b-pillar. Front's are 30%(35% maybe?). And windshield is also coated with a 'clear' tint. It rejects heat very well and I don't have to use a stupid cardboard shades even in direct Texas sun. If you live in the South and have tinted your car but not the windshield you're doing yourself a disfavor.&&Most people here fix it real quick lol. Otherwise you just roll down the windows and hope there isn't traffic.&&You adapt amazingly quickly. While you have A/C it seems impossible to live without it (Tucson here), when it goes, you just roll down your windows and sweat a lot. It's not great, but it's doable. &&I've had a daily driver without A/C in Texas. Drove it every day of our worst heat wave ever about 6 years ago. It was miserable sitting in traffic. But, really, you do get used to it.

I now have a classic car in the garage that never had A/C(it was an option when it was built in 1961 but wasn't common). I rarely take it out of the garage when temps are above 80F. It's supposed to be a fun weekend car. It's not much fun sweating your ass off on nearly 60 year old vinyl seats.&&I live in LA. I had a car with no AC. As a young man, I still overheated several times and dumped water all over myself. I would argue that sometimes people just die without air conditioning.  Just like sometimes people in the north freeze without heating.  &&> I know pretty much no one that has a/c in their vehicle.

How is this possible? Are you a time traveler? You from North Korea, bud?&&That's quite dangerous&&The fuck we do.

-Californian who doesn't go hiking or play baseball on triple digit days&&You would die in Texas. 85 is winter &&Pardon the minor correction. Griffith Park is IN the city of Los Angeles - not far from the Hollywood Bowl, and Dodger Stadium. It's huge  - kind of like Central Park in NYC or Golden Gate Park in SF, though a good portion of it is not manicured, just canyons with scrub and hiking trails.&&Shouldn't they start feeling extremely sick, nauseous, get a headache etc? That alone makes me want to sit down and gather myself, not go on for even longer.&&We routinely deal with that in our joint in Sydney. 30-35° is the pits.&&Not all apartments have AC :(&&I was able to not get teary-eyed because I didn't know her personally.&&I think Tarantino just really wanted someone experienced with saying the word ""basterd"" for that role&&Oh totally i didn't mean to say it would be a boring job I'd love to be able to have the vision to do that but alas I don't think that level of artistic creativity was born into me. 

I just meant that watching the same 5, 
I0, 20 or 30 minute sequence over and over to make sure it's perfect could get sort of repetitive and I imagine it's a job you can only succeed in if you are incredibly dedicated to it and without being super critical of what you have transformed the raw film into you just wouldn't make it. 

Not trying to piss on the job I recognise you need buckets of talent to be on this level, I just imagine the times when you're struggling and have hit a block are going to straight up suck.

Edit: and if you do hit that block and just move onto the next piece to return to what you're struggling with later and finding out the director and actors have quite literally spoken to you in it would no doubt give you your passion straight back to you. &&Did he also edit his commercial?&&TIL&&neat, thanks! Must be interesting to be the first people to effectively see the shots that are taken. Couple other questions...

Have you ever been witness to something going wrong with the processing of the film that effectively destroyed it and lost that day's shots? What happened?

With the move to digital cameras, how has your job changed?

Thanks! &&Taking food right out of the AEs mouths. &&thanks!&&Shit fam TIL. &&I got so many questions right now. What are the most interesting sequences that didn't make it into the movie? What are your favorite bloopers from what you saw? How much longer could a full cut have been? Do you have _any_ screencaps or photos or anything?&&>Also Tarantinos part should've been cut out haha

Sheddep blekk!&&True, that was such an awkward scene. It was completely unnecessary and his accent was terrible lol. They really could’ve just wrapped it up after the first shootout&&I think that's more a story problem than an editing problem.&&That’s more so the screenplay’s problem.&&My friend and I saw DU in the theater and laughed like idiots seeing him explode, while everyone else (who probably had no idea who who Tarantino is) was dead silent. Loved his cameo.&&I'd say more like 45&&Agreed. Probably my least favorite Tarantino flick. Although, I was tired as hell and it was late when I saw so I do need to rewatch it.&&It felt long for the sake of being long. &&It felt an hour and 30 minutes too long for me. &&Maybe, but Tarantino's second worst movie is probably still a lot better than most director/writer's best movies.&&Jackie Brown is certainly underrated and not at the bottom of my list but I don't think it can compete with Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction&&Waltz is my favorite actor , didn't even consider that though. Just imagine 

>Hi jessemaner&&Off white! &&Was...was that till schweiger? Did not remember he had a role in it.&&No, sad is when people don't realize how much they care for somebody until they are gone. I mean thousands of people reached out to Robin Williams family to tell them how much of an impact he had on their life. That's sad and it happens every day. Sally knew she was loved and Tarintino won't spend the rest of his life regretting not telling Sally how important she was to him. He did it throughout his career. That's fucking beautiful.&&Is it pronounced COM - PILL - ATION

Edit: So glad to learn I'm not the only one... there are dozens of us!

Double edit: Does no one else adore Michael Keaton in this film??&&Yes! This movie has everything-there's not a single thing I dislike about it. I love the music, the story, the style, and I adore the cast. &&You know, to be honest, I totally would have been fine with four hours of Django if the pacing was still good.&&I think having his axe-man (woman) around to do the cutting would still have helped, though, because a lot of things feel like they were incorrectly left in or cut.  The core of the movie is obviously great and DiCaprio and Waltz are allowed all the scenery they need for grazing, but you have the awkward last act, some of the minor characters feel like they were supposed to be more important, and given that these are new problems with a Tarantino movie I can only think that it was Menke's job to make these decisions before.

Django was jarring, but I also felt the same issue with Hateful Eight and that's what sort of clinched it in my mind as an editing problem.  Once again it has a solid core but I feel like it's arbitrarily  broken into different chapters because people expect that from Tarantino rather than the movie organically needing it, and the chapters themselves feel to me like they were in the wrong order.&&I think the movie wouldn't have ended and then kept going and then ended again if she'd still been alive to edit it, is all.&&I didnt feel that way and didnt know she died at the time when i saw it so i guess people are biased.&&>  Inglorious Basterds ... a stage play

I would go see that in a fucking heartbeat. Especially if they turned it into a musical.&&> Did she have Tarantino's ear for cutting scenes?

Here's one example of it being the case, see [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U76MBDKQe8s&t=16m35s) about how much was cut from the Travolta/Thurman date sequence in Pulp Fiction&&I can’t envision a good version of suicide squad. I would love to see someone glue it back together so that it works.&&Well, not That straight&&r/beetlejuicing&&Not always. But I can do waaaay more fun stuff. Try thinking about those fart effects with 8 point surround sound. 

&&112 is fine though&&Ive never seen a 113 and i never fucking will. 112 baby, till the day i fucking die&&I do if it's 90 degrees or more. Leather gets fucking hot.&&You must not have been to Texas bud&&This.

My first travel exeperience ever outside of the U.S was Bangkok, Thailand. Besides the completely surreal culture shock as a teen, as soon as I stepped off the plane into Thailand (mid summer) it was literally like stepping into a sauna on Mars. 

It was so humid and sticky that taking a shower to cool off made it 100% worse.&&I can't imagine where he's from.

In KC we have to do the same, and really anywhere it gets hot in the summer, and your car is parked in the sun you literally have to.

If your car has leather seats (especially black)and has been sitting in the sun for a few hours, you literally can not sit down.&&That guy is whacked. You don’t have to go to the south to cook your car down. I mean it reaches the 90s in parts of Canada.&&i lived in Tempe for 9 months and worked 4 miles from my pad.  i had a beat little Ranger that had overheated once and the head gasket was bad.

i could drive it exactly to work and home before it would grind down.  many of those days were 100° plus.  i had to take a second set of clothes every dah to be clean when i got to work.  &&If you have your windows down usually the air outside can cool the vehicle down enough while the air conditioning gets ready. I live in 40 Celsius weather in the summer sometimes and it usually does enough. It also gets to -25 Celsius in the winter but there is unfortunately no other way to combat it other than start you car for a bit.&&the trick is to blast the ac and drive with your windows down for like 10-30 seconds. it gets all the superheated air out and let’s new cooler air come in.&&I think everyone understood that. As someone from the north, I just never thought of people doing the opposite of what we do, which is starting the car to turn on the heat and waiting for it to heat up.&&Oeuf&&Having recently moved from the southeast to the southwest, dry heat ain't got shit on humid heat. When it's 90%+ humidity it just feels like it's impossible to cool down; sweating doesn't even work because the sweat can't easily evaporate.

Over here as long as you are in the shade it's not too bad at all...&&IMHO the dry heat isn’t nearly as bad _so long as you have lots of water_

Without a ton of water you just die immediately. But with water and shade it’s actually nice. &&I live in Vegas and it's only humid when it rains. My body will feel less hot because of the dryness, but things like belts and sidewalks feel so much hotter &&I visited London recently during a “heat wave” in which it got up to like 85. They actually don’t have air conditioning in a vast majority of their buildings since they don’t need it. &&Lol relax bud&&No, but I'm going to visit NK in February! But seriously though my truck actually has A/C but most of my friends drive older vehicle's so as long as the heat works it's no problem.&&Yeah. Luckily I was carrying two gallons of water in my backpack and we were never more than a half mile away from the car. I really regret taking her then but we took frequent breaks from short trails to drive to another one and took a midday break between the two parks and went to the town to eat inside.&&Ya I have no idea what that guy is talking about. People bitch when it’s over 90° in CA and act like it’s the end of the world. I did the same for 18 years... then I moved to Phoenix. Californians don’t know hot til they experience a 123° day.&&Reddit always reminds me that there are a lot of very emotional people out there. Nobody in my circle of family or friends would get teary eyed about something like this. &&I **want** that to be true.  lol&&I didn't take what you said as pissing on the job, it can definitely be a very tedious job. 

Hitting a block can suck, but the problem solving skills you develop allow you to often turn a creative block into an opportunity to try something out. *Especially* if you can get re-shoots, but not only then.

I mostly edit audio these days, which is a different beast, but there are plenty of similarities. Editing in general is really satisfying, for me. I can frequently introduce a new element or joke just by messing with the material that's there, and the timing.

Man. I'm gonna go edit something.

EDIT: The one thing I *hate* editing is essays or scripts, really any written word. If I'm writing a script for something, I'll generally write it out, read over it once to fix any glaring mistakes, and send it along (which is bad form), but that in particular is incredibly tedious for me, even though it has the same benefits of other sorts of editing. I just don't like doing it.

EDIT 2: I see the irony.&&Dont know haha but dear God I hope so.&&Craziest thing I saw was Shia LeBouf busting his head open on a (non-breakaway glass) window in a door and bleeding profusely from the temple for the rest of a twelve minute take.

My job hasn't changed much due to digital because Fotokem handles almost all film processing in LA so we had Nolan, Tarantino and others to keep us busy. Also, even digital shows need sound synching, and deliverables transcoded.&&Not really. Just work off their plates. There were still several AEs and they all got paid.&&Not sure how much I can say about things that didn't make it into the final cut. But I can share that I bought Sweet Dave's bloody chair at the wrap sale. [Here's some pics I took when I still had it.](https://imgur.com/a/517kZ) Sold it at the PropStore auction last year.&&That was really the most jarring cameo he's ever done in any of his films. His accent was *so bad!* Maybe that was the point but damn, it really took me out of the film and went on for too long and imo that was just enough for everything that came after to feel somewhat off and disjointed&&If there's a story/script problem and you shoot it, it becomes an edit problem. A good editor can help find a way around these problems. Being a good editor is all about understanding how to tell a story. 

Also many directors will consult with their editor at script stage, especially if they have a long working relationship like these two.

&&A hear a lot of people say hateful 8 is their least favorite, but loved It! It's hard to pull off a movie that long with pretty much one location, and they did a fantastic job.&&The one scene with Samuel L Jackson recounting the events of him making some guy giving him a blowjob could've been cut down a lot, it went from briefly funny to cringingly awful. Most of the rest of the movie stands pretty well, except that we could have had less trudging through the snow to barn outside the inn. &&Exactly&&I agree.&&Kill bill needs a seat at the table &&HUGO STIGLITZ.&&I love him. The resemblance to BJ Blazkowic is uncanny! &&Same here. I watched this movie a bunch, but it wasn't until that clip that I realized it was him.

&&It’s seriously so underrated by QT fans, too. Err’body on Pulp Fiction’s dick but I’m over here singing about life across 110th street.&&Jackie Brown is my favorite QT movie for a lot of reasons, but particularly for the scene where Max goes back to Jackie's apartment to get his gun the next day after she scares Ordell off.  The conversation they have, ""how do you feel about getting old?"" -- a soft, sincere, intimate moment in a film, done exquisitely by a director who pretty much never has that type of thing in his movies.&&Michael Keaton is always awesome.  He is easily the best Batman.  Jackie Brown is one of Samuel Jackson's best performances.  ""I hate to be the kind of lizard that does a favor for a lizard and then turns around and asks that lizard for a favor, but I have to be that lizard.""&&I really liked it, one of my faves tho is True Romance. I know he didn't direct it but damn was it a good one&&I agree totally. And the casting was so great for every character.&&Wait Keaton is in Jackie Brown? I'm gonna have to see it now. &&My favorite, too.  I think that film is an underrated cinematic masterpiece.&&I love Michael Keaton and his squeaky leather jacket. Keaton plays dorky serious guys so well. He and Michael Bowen make a great team in this flick.&&> Does no one else adore Michael Keaton in this film??

Yeah, he was great in that role. It was cool when he showed up again as the same character in *Out Of Sight*.&&If you haven’t already, check out Rum Punch, the Elmore Leonard novel it’s based on. Or any Leonard crime novels for that matter, if Quentin’s your thing.

Fun fact: QT was arrested in his youth for shoplifting a Leonard book. Or so he says. 😏&&I am so happy you said this. Jackie brown is my favorite as well. I feel it doesn’t get as much attention as his other films. Every scene in that movie is gold. The music, the editing.  The scenes are cut beautifully. ..And that is hands down Samuel L. Jackson’s best role ever. ..And yeah Michael Keaton kills it.&&One of Tarantino's pet projects was to turn it into a 4 episode miniseries eventually. &&There's a youtube interview with Fred Raskin, editor of Django Unchained and Hateful 8, who described the work as his dream job, and even if he was mentored by Menke, he does come off as the kind of breathless fanboy who's less likely to rein in a director he admires&&Yeah, honestly Hateful Eight is kind of a mess.&&Part of my problem with The Hateful Eight is the pacing of character introductions.  The first act slowly introduces the characters and let's you get to know each one at a nice pace.  Then when they get to Minnie's, you're quickly introduced to 4 new characters at once.  &&If I remember correctly, I believe the last scene was written in at the last second and the original ending was dropped somewhat. So that wasn't really an editing issue. &&[Springtime for Hitler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsql523bSj4) but reversed&&Supposedly the original directors cut was pretty good, but too long for WB. They brought in the guys who made the trailers to cut it again and that's apparently what ruined it - or at least, put the nail in the coffin. &&Yea suck it Chris, you like it don't you?&&Listening to a fart in Dolby atmos, tracking the fart in real time in 3d space. &&Yooo is mixing 8 point a lot harder than regular stereo??

It starts to feel good, and it keeps you from becoming super sticky and sweaty&&*Venus, Mars is an ice box.&&If you buy a car with black leather seats down here, you’re just asking for it. Sunshades and window tints are essential. I also spent my first summer with a car that had cloth (not leather) seats and holy shit the difference it made. &&I’m willing to bet a Canadian 90 with dry air feels like what 75 with 90% humidity feels like. Not to downplay y’all’s weather (I’d literally die in your winter), but I remember doing construction work in Juarez Mexico on a mission trip when I was younger. I remember them earning us about the 100 degree heat, and when we got there it was actually a welcomed relief from the heat of coastal Georgia. &&just chillin at the pad every dah brah &&But then you go to rest your arm on the window sill and get burnt&&I live in Northern Canada and in the summer I use my auto start to cool down my truck if it’s been sitting in the sun a while.

I haven't been yet. But when his girl came here, she said the heat here is worse.

You're still alive though so it wasn't too dangerous I guess!&&We frequently have strings of 100+ degree weeks, and by the third day everyone is used to it.

Sure it’s hot as hell, but you just get used to it, what Californians are you talking to? &&Haha no worries man i'm just used to people on here being super critical of whatever you say so was trying to get ahead of that and make sure I wasn't coming across as saying 'editing is ez pz' 

I'm glad you've found something you love and can make money to provide for yourself from I truly do appreciate the editors of anything and the times when I appreciate them most is when I've watched a film, music video, tv show or even an advert and not realised that it has been  edited, those are the times when I think 'wow the editing in this is amazing' it just flows and so yeah I may be a layperson to your craft but your apparent abscense of presence is probably what I'd consider as the tell tale sign of an amazing editor and even though I like to immerse myself in the media I'm consuming once it's done I do give things a proper a think and I'm grateful for the talents of an editor and other production staff for being so good they seem to not exist.

That's supposed to be a compliment but I can't imagine many other lines of work that would thank you for putting forth a piece of work where you are thanked for not being noticeable but it is a compliment I promise 😂. &&Classic Shia.&&I really enjoyed reading your answers on this thread. Thanks for your thoughtful responses &&I think his cameo in Pulp Fiction was more jarring...&&As an Aussie, watching that cameo in the cinema was great. Basically the whole audience let out a confused, collective “huh?” before a guy loudly whispered to his friend “what the fuck is that weird cunt doing?” and we all had a good chuckle. But yeah, takes you out of the movie that.&&I'm not saying it wasn't good, there was plenty for me to like! I just felt like there was too much dialouge when there could have been more succinct writing. &&Yup. First watch was great, watched it a year later and it was even better.&&But that was the whole point of the blow job scene? It wasnt a comedic relief, it was to get the old general all worked up. At the beginning you see how the general doesnt really believe him. Then he starts to believe him, but still got his cool. But the longer it went on (I/you) notice how worked up the general gets until he finally snaps and Jackson can kill him in self defense.&&And it was warm too, cause it was full of blood&&Watched it during the special roadshow release.

But aren’t the videos COMPILED together?&&On YouTube for Vine compilations&&Now that you mention it, David Mitchell would probably do quite well in a Tarantino film. After watching Back it looks like he can do that semi serious acting with weird dark undertones.&&That movie got me into Bobby Womack. Love his music.&&favorite QT film has got to be inglorious bastards. So much love for that movie and it frustrates me that people put it so low on best of lists. &&I think I get why fans disregard it, not that I agree with them.While I'm hardcore on the ""Inglourious Basterds is his best!"" train, if asked which of his is my favorite, it's usually the one I watched last. But Jackie Brown is kinda special in my opinion.

Tarantino does his own style, which some look down on, but this film wasn't in that style, it's different. It's more like a traditional Hollywood film. And it's still _awesome_. He effectively said ""Okay, I'll make a movie like everyone else,"" and he did it better than most of them. So while some may not enjoy it because it's less like his other stuff, I think it shows range that his detractors sometimes argue he doesn't have.

Now if only more people would realize Inglourious Basterds was about film.&&Everyone on Reddit seems to love it. Casual Tarantino fans may or may not but it's definitely a great film.&&I feel like most QT fans are not on pulp fictions dick these days. And I speculate this solely due to the subconscious hipster urges us QT fans feel (speaking as a representative of course). Due to this, we gravitate away from his most popular films. It's subtle and second nature, though. &&I enjoyed deathproof more even though its not as fleshed out or crazy I enjoyed the simple premise&&Maybe I'm weird, but JB is one of my favorites and PF one of my least favorites.&&I always think of this scene. 

“When I look in the mirror. Still looks like me” &&I’m convinced that Tarantino is such a film savant that he could be the best mainstream director since Spielberg, but he just enjoys making “Tarantino flicks” more. Jackie Brown proves he knows how to make a perfectly written/shot/paced “normal” movie, he just enjoys fucking around more.&&It's actually one of my favorite roles of his, and he's one of my favorite actors of all time.&&Any expansion on Django is highly welcomed. My favorite movie this side of the year 2000. I absolutely fucking loved it.&&I still liked it, but it’s one of the weaker Tarantino films imo.&&Dammit, now that song will be stuck in my head all xmas eve&&If I recall correctly they also did a ton of reshoots to cut in one-liners in an attempt to make it more like Deadpool, since that came out to massive success between wrapping filming and release.

It's like using charcoal or a pen to draw vs painting, you have color in one vs the other but that doesn't make it harder or easier.

Couldn't imagine how awful doing that in Vegas would be. &&If we went on longer trails I’d say it’d have been worse. She’s type one diabetic and i already pushed her too hard in Acadia so I tried to be really cautious on this trip. But that sun was awful. I got heavily sunburned in my car with tinted windows rolled up just driving through Arizona.&&That's like saying ""Russian Roulette isn't so dangerous!"" just because you didn't get the bullet &&Ha! That's the goal. I don't know that I'm anywhere near that, but that's the goal.

I don't edit professionally (at least, not video -- I'm a voice-over guy, so audio editing is part of my job, but video editing's been 95% hobby/school, 5% paid), but I find a lot of joy in it. 

I've heard people say the same of CGI -- it's at its best when you don't realize it's there. We have many incredible tools at our disposal, with the end goal of ""try not to signal to the audience that you've used this tool."" It's a fascinating field. Editors are likely responsible for many classic movie moments that weren't intended on the page or in the performance. Pacing and timing dictate so much of how a piece of media is received, and while scripts are written with pacing in mind, it's brought to fruition and further developed in the edit bay.

But, back to the original point, sometimes it's tedious as all fuck. I used to edit a couple videos a month for a Youtube channel (that I still work with as the voice of the channel, but I ditched the editing) that does nothing but list videos. Holy fuck is it draining to find pictures that kinda-sorta relate to what's being said, adhere to the style guide of the channel, use only a handful of transitions, etc. Very little creative freedom there. That was 100% for the money, I got no joy at all from editing that shit.&&Did you see the fucking sign?!&&Not jarring like ""pull me out of the movie"" how Django was though. Just ""whoa, he's just casually dropping n-bombs"" jarring in PF.&&I think his most jarring ""cameo"" would be as the narrator in Hateful Eight.  It's more than halfway through the film and he basically comes out of no where all, ""Hey guys, Quentin here.  So at this point in the movie it's getting harder to show things without explaining them so I thought I'd just pop on in to chat with you.  Don't concern yourself with the fact you've been watching this now for over an hour at this point and this is the first you're hearing a narrator.""&&That's just because it's so many years later. I garuntee when pulp fiction came out, Tarantino himself was the least jarring thing about the whole scene.&&Way better though. Way.&&Yes, way too much dialog. &&I remember seeing that in the cinema and the interval was straight after, so you were thinking wtffff for ten minutes. I thought it was perfect because it builds suspense and is so long the viewer can't believe what they're watching, then bam, release and of course then in the second half the body count rises a lot more. Worked really well to me&&I totally understand your point, but I feel that Tarantino could have written fewer words and the point could come across the same. Samuel L doesn't need 2 whole minutes to explain his son sucking his dick to get him angry, the old generals hatred for Samuel should have welled back up immediately. &&Its devisive as always with movies.

Cristoph Waltz’s performance is by far the best of all the characters in any QT film, though - no debate.&&I actually really like The Hateful Eight.&&People under-rate it? I've always heard people call it his magnum opus.&&I agree it's easily his best. From the music, the thematic aspects, and the soundtrack it's just fantastic all around. Plus christoph waltz gives the performance of his career.&&Yes yes yes! My favorite movie, of all time. The first time I watched it I felt so sad when it ended.. I had this weird sensation of wanting it be able to watch it again, for the first time.&&I have to ask though, are you old enough that you saw Pulp Fiction when it came out?

The way my dad always speaks about the movie, it’s like an Alien, or The Matrix. One of those watershed films, in which everything that came before Pulp Fiction was completely different, and everything that came after tried to be just like it.

I appreciate the film much more because it influenced the ENTIRE MOVIE industry for years.&&I agree with PF being one of his worst movies. Still absolutely incredible, but something about it made it a bit of a chore for me - every scene was amazing on its own but when it was brought together I just felt like something was missing.&&You people laugh, but I remember how I saw people wearing parkas in 70°F weather at the south rim of the Grand Canyon and asked ""Why?""

They were from Yuma and Phoenix. &&You'll need luck to survive 117&&I wish I could tell you how it works, all I can tell you is to give it a shot next time you shower. My best guess is that it literally cools down your skin and body, like jumping into snow after a sauna, but dialed way back.
 I actually still do this in the winter time for the opposite reason. When you rinse off with cold water for a while after the warm shower, and then you turn the water off, the rest of the bathroom is the warm spot, instead of the shower being the warmest part of the bathroom. That being said I live in Georgia and we had a high today of 73F, it’s dec. 23

&&I've lived in India since birth, the cold water at the end was instinctive, nobody told me I need to do that.

That's what I love about his films. He just does wierd shit for the hell of it and it just cracks me up every time. &&I only saw The Hateful Eight once in theaters, where they did the Intermission. I was wondering if the ""recap"" was still in the home release and sure enough, ha.&&The dialogue is the best thing about Tarantino.

Waltz was great, but from the monologue that Jackson delivers to the chemistry that Travolta has in that scene at Jack Rabbit pulp fiction delivered on some hard as nails characters that had a soft side too.

Also, Travolta's performance was so amazing that it basically rejuvenated his career, which he promptly flushed down the toilet.&&That's a bingo.&&I can't imagine anyone else as Landa, but I also can't imagine anyone other than Uma Thurman as The Bride. QT's so good at finding THE person. I wish I could pick his brain.&&The opening scene, from his arrival on the farm to the glass of milk to the language shifts and the rest, the dialogue, the tension, it and he are incredible, and then his Oscar acceptance speech to boot.  That guy acts.&&Samuel L Jackson's role in Pulp fiction as Jules was more iconic and memorable.

&&Absolutely! He's my favorite actor now. After watching I.B., I immediately googled to see what other movies he was in, and was ecstatic to see he was in another QT movie as well.&&There may have never been a part played as perfectly in the history of film as Sam Jackson’s Jules. Waltz is great, but settle tf down.&&He absolutely nails the charming yet terrifying role, every scene he was in had this tension which only someone with that kind of presence can bring.&&He's tied with the late great Michael Parks, [I never tire of watching his hallway scene in deathproof!](#spoiler)

He's the neat bow that wraps the entire film together. Amazing acting.&&Christopher waltz is absolutely captivating in IB.

The entire first scene is so slow and methodical and yet you just can’t look away from it.&&I know that feeling exactly. Weirdly enough the only other movie I remember feeling that way exactly was the first pirates of the Caribbean. I was just so fully engaged with those movies I didn’t want it to stop. &&Exactly.

"Robert Pattinson set to star in French art house director Claire Denis' first English-language film 'High Life', a genre-bending sci-fi drama about a death row inmate sent on an isolated, no-return mission to explore a black hole",55369,7kehsc,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/high-life-why-robert-pattinson-was-perfect-actor-claire-denis-sci-fi-movie-afm-2017-1054930,1708,1513526303.0,,"Oh shit the premise of this movie sounds pretty insane.

In a good way.&&Robert Pattinson doing more weird shit? Hell yes. Sign me the fuck up.&&It is amazing that Daniel Radcliffe, Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattinson are consistently working with great directors on unusual films like these. It's not at all what I would have expected from them like ten years ago.&&I originally read this title as ""gender-bending sci-fi film"" and said to myself - are they trying to do too much here?&&It would be funny if it's only a half hour long and the moment he goes in the black hole he gets crushed and dies. The end &&That guy has really picked himself up from Twilight.&&Robert Pattinson was fantastic in Lost City of Z and Good Time. Can't wait to see him in this one as well&&Sounds like an SCP Foundation film

edit: also wanna say Robert Pattinson makes some [really great music](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoPCJisvlNE)&&Claire Denis is one my favorite directors. I can't wait to see what she does with this.

For those that don't know her, I highly recommend ""35 Shots of Rum"" (original name: ""35 Rhums"". One of my all time favorite films - the dance scene in the restaurant is one of the greatest sequences ever shot - I wish her discussion of this scene was still on YouTube - I can't find it) and ""White Material""

""Beau Travail"" is a big hit of hers - I like it for the amazing ending. You can YouTube that one yourself :)

It should also be noted that not only is she a very accomplished auteur director but she was also an accomplished *assistant director* on many films - including Wim Wenders' legendary ""Wings of Desire"" and ""Paris, Texas"". For those not in the know, ""assistant director"" isn't just like the director's helper or something. ""Assistant Director"" (AD) is a totally different job - more like the foreman of the set - of the entire crew. Time keeper, schedule maker, and much more. It's a notoriously tough job that actually takes a great toll on people's lives.

So Claire Denis, writer, director, assistant director, and badass. A living master and a truly underrated. I hope this film makes her more well known in the English speaking world.&&I'm getting to the point where I'll watch almost anything Robert Pattinson does (how crazy that statement would have been only a few years ago).

He was so fucking good in Good Time. Was hoping he would sneak into at least a Golden Globe nomination. Maybe my favorite performance of the whole year. And he was great in The Rover and The Lost City of Z. &&I look forward to those not familiar with Claire Denis stumbling onto this.&&Why did I read this as Pat Robertson.......Was really confused. &&I read the title as ""gender-bending."" I was like ""man, I get that he's a good looking dude, but do we really have to put him in a dress in space??""&&Spoilers:  He discovers a tesseract and uses it to communicate through his daughter's library.&&Juliette Binoche is in it as well. I really like Claire Denis. I can’t wait to see this!&&That Robert Pattinson really likes his off the wall, batshit crazy movies. That's pretty commendable in today's movie landscape. &&I'm now watching anything starring Pattinson so lookin forward to this.&&Are you ever just disappointed that you weren't the one to come up with a fantastically interesting concept for a story? Well that's me right now, reading this.

Regardless, this sounds like a great film&&Pretty sure there are going to be unforeseen consequences&&ITT: Rob Pattinson is Reddit’s favorite actor &&Who would've thought the Twilight kids would grow up to be legit arthouse darlings.&&Is this based on a book? I would read the shit out of this. Like a very dark *The Martian*.&&Reminded me of Niven's ""A World Out Of Time"" when I saw the headline.  One of my favorite books.&&holy shit, I misread this as half life at first. Pattinson as Gordon Freeman? Bold move Cotton. &&And would be perfect if the Tindersticks did the music.&&Death Grips gotta do the soundtrack&&And her original choice was Philip Seymour Hoffman. Interesting swap, but I'm digging it.&&For reference, Denis' film Beau Travail is on the Sight and Sound list for the 250 Greatest Films of All Time. In fact it even made the top 100, which is rare for a film only fourteen years old at the time it made the list. Denis is one of the best working today.&&This sounds awesome.

Death by spaghettification doesn't sound too fun, though.&&I read that as Pat Robertson and was so confused &&Robert Pattinson was ridiculously good in Lost City of Z and Good Time. 

Really has become an amazing actor and should be sought after. &&I'm so happy Robert is more than just the Twilight guy. He is becoming one of my favorite actors. &&The fact that Pattinson's role in Good Time this year has been so overlooked by award shows is a crime. He literally became that character.&&[deleted]&&This sounds freaking awesome!&&I loved Pattinson in Rover. Super excited about this.&&A friend of mine wrote a best seller short on the same premise!&&I'm really glad Pattinson and Stewart have spent their Twilight money making weird passion projects and arthouse. They've both actually turned out to be really solid actors.&&Yes! Yes to all this!&&So essentially he is playing a Terran marine from Starcraft.&&Is this about anal?&&Escape from ~~New York~~ Earth.&&His bank heist gone wrong indie flick called Good Time is really good too.&&That headline got better and better with every word.&&This sounds awesome &&""Sold""

-Mike Stoklasa. &&Pitch Black + Interstellar.&&I feel like 20 years from now we will view media's treatment of Black holes the way we view how comic book writers treated radioactive material..&&Sorry this isn't a sequel or reboot so I don't know that I can find it interesting.&&This is a big deal. Denis is a phenomenal filmmaker. More from her aimed at a broader audience is great. The premise of this project sounds fascinating as well.&&In a role originally envisioned for Vincent Gallo and then Philip Seymour Hoffman by the way. &&Pattinson has been killing it lately with his role selection.  I'm fully on board with this film.  &&I love his film choices. I'm so glad he didn't go the route of doing large blockbuster commercial films like so many mega-stars doing. He's come a long way.....although he was so dreamy in Twilight...and Harry Potter....hell he was even hot in Good Times....is it possible for him to look ugly? I don't think so. lol&&yep.  my first impression is, I'm In.&&Sounds like a Good Time&&If you want sneak peek this is the premise of ""A World out of Time"" by Larry Niven.&&I bet 2% of the movie is actually about space and black holes and rest is about what the director really wanted to make a movie about but knew no one would watch it without a cool sounding premise.&&This has been my dream to see in a movie, I was excited by interstellar but they didnt really capture what I was expecting.  I always ask people, ""would you rather go to jail your whole life, or live a good life until 60 and get sent into a black hole for science""?  I'm sure turning to moms spaghetti sucks, but the theories on what you might be able to see, and being the only one to see, I think I'd opt for the black hole. &&Similar plot to an episode of The Twilight Zone where an inmate is sentenced to solitary confinement on an asteroid for 50 years. Titled of the episode is “The Lonely”. Should be on Netflix and Amazon Prime if you’re interested! &&It's a French movie, it'll probably be like 90% drama and 10% sci-fi.&&The full description of the movie's plot says that they're being sexually experimented on so don't expect Interstellar here.&&https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Sad-Suicide-Rohan-Wijeratne/dp/1521967547

This is basically the premise of a really good short a friend of mine wrote!!&&That's what I thought at first too. Then realized that Interstellar already showed a one way trip (when the character takes it) into a black hole. So the only difference so far seems to be the death row inmate thing.

I'm sure the dramatization of what it might be inside the black hole would be different and that hopefully is good. Black holes are always cool. &&I'm glad he got out of the Pretty-Boy Movie Lead trap and into more thematically rich territory. He's a excellent actor. His trajectory reminds me of Leonardo DeCaprios. &&Been a fan of him doing weird things since i found out he was banging FKA Twigs&&[deleted]&&Well it's understandable they would want to prove themselves as ""real actors"" or whatever, and i imagine they have the star power to work with whoever they want especially if it's a smaller film

But yes it is surprising and pretty cool&&[removed]&&Daniel Radcliffe stars in movies that clearly would never have been produced if his name weren’t attached to the project. &&Only one who failed to get better was Lautner. &&The Rover might be my favorite movie. I never thought I'd say that about a Robert Pattinson movie, let alone one where he's doing a (pretty decent) impression of my family's accent.&&But Kristen Stewart has always done these kind of films! The Twilight movies were the exception, not the rule.

Speak, Into the Wild, Adventureland, Welcome to the Rileys, The Runaways, Clouds of Sils Maria, Still Alice and Personal Shopper are all movies I liked and her filmography couldn't be more diverse. 

That's why I hated the whole ""Kristen Stewart has only one facial expression"" meme. She is an underrated actor.&&There might have been a reason why those films stood out—-their talent was real.&&True. Good time was really good. Didn't even realize it was Pattinson till the credits, then I flipped. &&I think it's all that money. Theyvr tried being the biggest thing in cinema, so they don't have to work towards that goal. And they never have to take a job for money, so they can just focus on developing their craft. &&I genuinely feel he is the best actor out of the YA book movie adaptions bunch.

I love everything he has been cast in..including Edward Cullen. Its a shame he hasnt really..been considered for bigger roles..I'd love to see him in Marvel or DC.&&Running as far in the opposite direction from sparkling teenage vampire heart-throb and kiddie-wizard movies as they possibly could was the only option. It's established their credibility and perhaps saved their careers. Good for them.&&I'm really happy for all of them that they managed to actually escape their introductory roles. Starting as Harry Potter might not have been too bad, but Robert Pattinson would probably hate only being known as a glittery tick person.&&Elijah Wood too&&Oh shit, I misread that too.

*He's a male from a high-security prison facility. Or is he?*&&Me too. I pictured Robert Pattinson in drag hurt*ling towards a black hole. &&Same here, I was so confused when the black hole came in&&*film 'Half-Life', a gender-bending sci-fi drama*

I would watch it.
&&I originally read the title as ""half life"", and then i got sad when i reread it&&Better yet, the mission is immediately canceled prior to any funding due to how incredibly dumb and expensive it is.&&Or some wolves (that are jealous of his girlfriend) bite him on the launch pad.&&Ol’ Cedric the glimmering wizard moving on up in the world&&Idk why people thought that was career ending. It made him famous and many directors noticed him from Twilight. Not everyone hated the movies. They could’ve been much better, sure, but at least people saw the potential in Rob and Kristen. They never stopped working since. &&His interviews about Twilight were mostly pretty comical, at least where he could be honest. Seems he hates the shit.&&Good Time was such a surprise for me. Really enjoyed it.&&I had some problems with Z but man Pattinson was good in it. &&He was amazing in Cosmopolis as well. I love Pattinson.&&Yeah, dude has some chops, but people just go ""wah, twilight"". I'm excited for this, I like the premise.&&If you haven't seen The Rover, do so. He's great in it. &&Also Water for Elephants&&Sending D-class personal on a suicide mission to investigate something strange? Yep sounds about right.&&Vaguely like the Khevtuul-1 SCP but already sounds like it'll have a better story past the initial 20 lines.

So long as Pattinson doesn't inexplicably turn into a badly written AM I'm interested.&&REDACTED&&Dropping D-Class into a black hole as probably been done several times, actually.&&I swear, Netflix would do great with an SCP inspired original&&Title: [REDACTED]&&Would be amazing to have an SCP tv series. There's a youtuber who's been doing an episode a month and they're amazing. &&The ending of ""Beau Travail"" may be my favorite final scene of any film.  But I've always wondered about the ambiguity of it. [Does Galoupe commit suicide before the famous dance sequence?](#spoiler)&&As a lady-AD myself, I have nothing but respect for any woman who's able to build a reputation of excellence within the AD department. There's no doubt that Denise can command a room. &&I haven't watched Good TIme & Lost City of Z. I'm in small town with one screen cinema :( . Watched The Rover on Amazon and bawling seeing his character&&Agreed. Despite being the sparkly vampire for years, he has an ability to just disappear into whatever part he plays now. He’s a seriously exciting actor.&&I have a similar relationship with Ashton Kutcher. Hated his ass until ""what happens in vegas"".&&He also had prominent roles in the last two Cronenberg films, both great. Cosmopolis was the first (major) adaptation of a Don DeLillo novel, and, although a lot dislike it, I thought it was perfectly executed. &&[deleted]&&She’s amazing. And I disagree with the other commenter who said ‘they’ll hate it’. I disagree. I think many people appreciate different cinema when they actually see it, it’s just that more of an effort is required to get exposed to it, so much of it goes unseen by a majority. &&Haha, they’re gonna fucking hate it.&&[You're not the only one](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7kehsc/robert_pattinson_set_to_star_in_french_art_house/drdy11f/?context=3)&&Oh my god me too. SUPER confusing. &&Pattinson and Binoche together is wonderful. This is instantly one of my most anticipated films of 2018.&&Don't worry, I'm sure nobody would pick up this movie if either of us were the ones who came up with it. 

Agreed it sounds like a great film though&&Also ITT: people that think Pattinson is shitty because they’ve only seen him in Twilight&&Well, hes earned the attention.&&They both did quirky, interesting movies even before Twilight. I think Twilight was a huge accident because they all thought it would be a small, cult teen vampire movie from the director of Thirteen and then they’d move on. None of them thought it would turn into what it did or that there would be four sequels. But long before that they both liked working in cool indie projects. &&Not as far as I know but if you want a book that’s eerily similar then check out Annihilator by Grant Morrison. It’s a comic about a writer who has this character who is the galaxys worst criminal and his prison is at the edge of a black hole called Annhilator. It’s dope. &&[You're not the only one](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7kehsc/robert_pattinson_set_to_star_in_french_art_house/drdue9x/?context=3)&&This is the internet, you’re allowed to swear here, we won’t tell on you.&&> about a death row inmate sent on an isolated, no-return mission to explore a black hole

If it's just the mission to explore a black hole, then the similarity is no big deal.&&I work in the publishing industry and just recently became published myself, and there's no stopping this. It was probably already 'done' even before this screenplay. It was probably already 'done' even before that thing. Everything has been done. Sometimes it's even been done better. No big deal. Keep rolling. Your take on something that's already been done is still valid and interesting. I even kind of prefer it when that happens, because then I'm not relying on the ~originality~ of my premise to prop the whole thing up. I have a challenge to make it mine. That makes it fun.&&You finish that book and you make it better than this film, Charles! I believe in you!&&so tell us how the movie ends.

whats in the black hole?&&Just because something similar has been done before doesn't mean you can't do it differently and/or better. Don't give up on your project, or feel down about it. Just make it your own.&&I write screenplays and am trying to break into the industry, and this is my nightmare.&&There is already a book too with a very smiliar premise: Transport by Phillip P. Peterson. &&I read this in Perd Hapley’s voice&&So its prison break/interstellar...

Late edit: movie title should be ""Breaking and Interstellar""&&Just watched that again on Fri, Robert is excellent in it...and so is Benny Safdie.

[Good Time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846232/)&&Also, Rammer, by the same author. &&Thanks, I'll check it out.&&I imagine it's more of a psychological/philosophical film than hard science fiction, and that's enough of a sell for me.  I'm in either way!&&The director said in the article that is was more about drama, than sci-fi

>But for me, this is less a science-fiction film than a drama, a Claire Denis film, set outside the solar system. The story of the film is about this crew, who are prisoners and are offered the chance to take part in this trip into space, knowing that there is no return.&&I’d take my chances with black hole over the certainty of the nursing home any day.&&**60**? Hahaha what, that's a no-brainer. Now, 40 something makes that a choice.&&Both are similar to Larry Niven's 'A World Out Of Time"". &&He was great in Lost City of Z. Kind of reminds me of Leonardo DuCaproix&&In all fairness, he was really good in Twilight. You just couldn't tell cuz he didn't have that much to work with. But he squeezed every ounce of character he had out of the source material.&&No one hated Twilight as much as Robert Pattinson. 
I mean, seriously, [look at this shit lol](https://youtu.be/nFA6Ycch1EM)&&Me too. He has fought very hard to stay away from commercial, romantic, dream boat stuff and has really grown as an actor. He’ll definitely get an Oscar one day. This is something so many of his American contemporaries couldn’t do. But all the Brits of his generation have been killing it for a while. 
&&what are some good films he's done after twilight?&&I saw him at a D'angelo show a couple years back. Dude went from vampires and werewolves to rhythm and blues &&What's a FKA twig&&Think they broke up. Shame, she is the reason a lot of us reclassified him from broody teen idol to possibly interesting artist. &&In some pics, FKA Twigs kinda looks like a female black Robert Pattinson&&SWALLOWED BY BEES&&Speaking of I've Seen Footage, p sure he tracked guitar for a Death Grips song in Government Plates&&noided&&[deleted]&&Don’t forget the fact that they have enough money for a hundred lifetimes, so they could afford to do films for a smaller income than what might be expected. &&Meanwhile Rupert Grint bought an ice cream truck and co-starred in Thunderpants. 

Some people have divergent goals.&&Yes most a-listers will dabble in arthouse and experimental films to an extent, but Robert Pattinson has really gone above and beyond&&I don’t think Radcliffe needs to prove anything. I know what you’re saying with “real actors” but I think his performance across the Harry Potter movies was fantastic. A little cheese here and there but still great performances from Child actors. &&To be fair, the Harry Potter films were good and Daniel Radcliffe came off looking like a fairly decent actor. The same could not be said of Twilight and it's lifeless leads-especially Kristen Stewart.&&He was incredible in Maniac and he's great in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency too.&&One of my favourite actors that seems to just show up in things. Still have to check out season 2 of Dirk Gently. &&He was also in a generally bizarre [music video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C66yhRwpt7s) for the Apples in Stereo.&&Not to mention he was one of the producers of The Greasy Strangler. The man has a taste for weird cinema.&&...Like what? He's got some bad movies in his filmography, but the worse ones were either things he signed onto after they started production or which had other big names attached. Victor Frankenstein was his worst movie, but it had James McAvoy as first billing&&Swiss Army Man is exactly what modern cinema is lacking! It was absurd, heart warming, funny, irreverent,  fun, and most of all imaginative. Movies can be magic, instead we get formulaic blockbusters ad nauseum&&really??
horns was a movie based on a book and easily could have had anyone else (not saying he was bad), and same with Swiss Army Man.
I think both movies can stand on their own without him&&He was never decent to begin with, because when you look at it Pattinson was in Harry Potter before Twilight, Stewart was in Panic Room and Lautner was in Sharkboy and Lavagirl&&when people said Lautner was the best out of Twilight (when the whole series was still hot) , I just laugh. Wait and see folks&&I kind of enjoyed his season of cuckoo. I mean, ridiculous- but a good bizarre dude for Greg Davies to react to. &&Hell yeah, dude. You're the first person I've seen who knows of that movie other than me. My theater I worked at had it for like 4 days.

Great film&&The only movie I had seen Stewart in apart from Twilight was Panic Room, and I honestly didn't even make the connection until I saw Stewart's IMDb page. I also hated the ""Kristen Stewart has only one facial expression"" meme but for a different reason. 

What bothered me about the meme was that years ago when Twilight was a big deal, I had a crush on a girl who loved the books. In a desperate attempt to connect with her, I read the first book... I was on the cusp of manhood and I figured that reading a bad book for someone is basically flirting. I had already seen the movie before so when I was reading the book I started to figure something out: Stewart was turned into a meme because she portrayed Bella flawlessly.

Her acting in Twilight is so one-note because Bella is a one-note character. &&She's has a good eye for scripts, no doubt about it, but I really struggle with her style.  I don't think I've ever been particularly impressed, and i say that knowing full well that many a fine mind enjoys her work.&&Stewart was in a hard pressure position. I felt bad for her in Twilight, Bella is supposed to be super awkward. It's just not a good character. audience dislikes Bella and so they dislike Stewart too. Twilight was hot at that time so of course just double the hating. Her other projects are great&&adding Certain Women to this list&&Kristen Stewart has always been writing too. Now she’s directing. Her new short film has pushed tech enough for her to co-write a paper on it.&&Most people who say that don't tend to watch independant indie movies to begin with. Heck, the probably don't know her in anything else other than Twilight.&&Personal Shopper is in my top ten films of the year. I've never seen a movie move seamlessly through so many different tones and genres without once feeling forced or straying away from the heart of the story.&&Lol what? It's not like he wears a mask or something. &&Kristen Stewart was always doing indie/weird movies with very famous actors. And Rob was always a pretty big weirdo himself. As someone above said, I believe Twilight was the exception, not the rule, for these 2. I think no matter how it ended up, they were always going to strive to do weird movies like what they’ve been doing post-Twilight&&Is black hole a euphemism?&&*in a world where nothing is assumed, everything we know  about to be doubted.&&>hurdling

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/KyAjoWN&&Seriously like why couldn’t they just send a camera in not an actual person.&&Sounds like something Garth Marenghi would write

Edit: Wait, what? Wasn't the parent comment about them being eaten by wolves on the launch pad?&&That, and what a lot of people don't realize is you can be a good actor in a shit movie. When directors are watching stuff like that looking for actors, they're. It sitting there thinking ""this script is terrible"" or other stuff, they're thinking ""he's really making me believe he's a 150 year old vampire in love with this girl"". 

&&[Here's a compilation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFA6Ycch1EM) My favourite bit is where he describes his own performance as a combination of being constipated and stoned. &&That movie was a breath of fresh air! Pure, raw cinematic talent from the Safdies.&&Just watched it last night. So so good. I about lost my shit when a certain character woke up in Crystal's house. &&Oneohtrix Point Never also killed the soundtrack. That song with Iggy Pop is beautiful. &&Watching that in the theatre was pure cinematic pleasure. Such a different experience then when I rewatched it at home. Oneohtrix did such a great job with the soundtrack, too. &&they say Connie Nikas broke out of Edward Cullen like a chestbuster&&Curious, what problems did you have? I’m usually pretty critical of movies but didn’t see much in the way of flaws &&Cronenberg did a fantastic job adapting that book. Pattinson was perfect in that role. &&Which is so unfair because that was *ten year ago*.&&It's such a shame that film bombed, it's so good. &&So that's it, huh&&we need an SCP movie about the phone that’s constantly ringing and if you pick it up you instantly get transported to hell. I’d be fascinated to see how they could come up with any sort of plot for that. like maybe the discovery of it can be like the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and instead of the golden idol on the altar, it can instead be that phone. yeah. that’d be tight&&I interpreted it as [him mentally escaping into that activity where he can still find solace and self-expression during the moments where he takes his own life. I also love it because I can never listen to that song again without thinking about Lavant dancing to it.](#spoiler) &&Lost City of Z is on Amazon Prime, and since Good Time is A24 I would bet it’s going to be on there sometime &&French&&[deleted]&&Well, definitely not ""mainstream"", a bit like modern art

One of her best movie Beau Travail (Good Work) is on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCN2F2H6kQ) &&[deleted]&&Denis is, in my opinion, the greatest working director and one of the best of all time.

If people hate it, I think it will be similar to people hating It Comes at Night or something similar. Like, imagine if Trouble Every Day came out today and was marketed like Insidious. Just depends on expectations, I guess.

Of course, this is assuming it's good but it is Claire Denis after all.&&I think it's actually really cool that robert pattinson is working in these kind of movies, i think a lot more people saw good time than otherwise would have and i hope this will be the same :)&&Honestly though, that's simply not true. The only difference between you two and this director is experience, and even then they were in your exact shoes once. 

If they can do this then so can you.

To be frank I want more people making art. &&I actually am a rare minority that actually liked him in Twilight (I am an unashamed fan of the books) and thought he has only gotten better and better &&Crap.&&FUUUUCCCKKKKK MY GOD DAMN FUCKING LIFE. &&Not on my Christian Minecraft server!&&It's a group of non humans, tried as heretics and sent in to a structure first thought to be a black hole; on what's described as an exploratory mission. &&Thanks you big spud muffin&&Ill send you my unedited manuscript when it's done if you'd like. &&The timing of it all is what kills me most. &&This is certainly a movie. A movie that I might say is good! And I do!&&My reaction to this comment is that I also thought the same thing.&&People are saying this is a movie that you can watch.&&Sending criminals into a black hole is a hell of way to deal with prison overpopulation. &&What are we, some kind of Interstellar Suicide Squad?&&Don't forget 12 Monkeys&&Prism Break&&Breaking Rad

Because of the raduation

Edit: I decided not to fix it&&Leave the movie titles to the experts&&“Breaking Blackhole” or perhaps “Breaking and Interstellaring. “&&I think it's more of a XXX and interestellar.&&Okay, bear with me here, what about.. “Interstellar Prison Break”?&&Yes and it’s fine with me&&Meets the 100&&I just need more of this kind of sci-fi in my life, I don't care if they crossed every semi successful series with interstellar.

(Water of Elephants is really nice too)&&And Rampart, by Woodrick Q. Harrelstein&&See also ""The Jaunt"" by Stephen King&&That’s Claire Denis style, Trouble Everyday is a “horror” film but it’s really more just Vincent Gallo brooding around Paris and two guys being silent together. Great film but definitely meditative. &&Reddit doesn't read the articles&&I think you guys are forgetting something... as you approach the black hole, time will stretch out. Who knows how long you would be conscious as you gradually turn into a fleshy string??&&is that the french version of Leonardo DiCaprio? 
&&Leonardo D'Capri had good roles when he was a teen idol though. Kristen Stewart is a bit more like DeCaprice in that regard.&&[deleted]&&Don’t forget Lernernerner DiCapricorn’s performance in The Haberdasher’s Peanut &&Yeah, I didn't like the movie that much, but he was great and almost unrecognizable.&&Wait what? He was in Lost City of Z? As who?&&They've all been pretty meh that I've seen, but his acting consistently stands out above the material he's working with if you understand what I mean. 

'Good Time's released this year is meant to be pretty decent though.&&Check out [The Rover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChM2icbWo9w).

Seriously&&[deleted]&&They stay noided. &&I've seen footage, just not of this particular film. &&Like how Elijah Wood does all weird shit now cause he's like ""I got Frodo money. Let me enjoy making a movie about teachers escaping from a school of zombie children!""&&I love when actors do this. The greatest Steve Martin performance ever is The Spanish Prisoner, and I'm sure he made peanuts for that film compared to what he could have earned from other offers.&&Daniel did a long form podcast interview and had basically that to say. He has more money that possibly imaginable and unlike some peers will never need to take a role for a pay cheque.

I suspect in due time he will become one of the great actors in history. &&Thunderpants came out only a few months after the Philosopher's Stone, so that isn't too weird. Now Cherrybomb, that was a fucking fun movie that I wouldn't have expected from a Harry Potter actor. He also played Cheetah Chrome in CBGB. Say what you will about the film, but he was perfectly cast. &&I agree 100%, I just meant do something non franchise and not as huge &&[removed]&&In ""Sin City"", his performance is really creepy. So, I guess he did well (although it is a small part).&&swiss army man, jungle, and imperium. &&I liked Victor Frankenstein &&I don't think they were saying the movies wouldn't have worked without him, I think they were saying those movies wouldn't have gotten funded if his name weren't attached to the projects.&&Movie studios aren’t gonna invest in a movie there’s no money in.

Edit: here's proof that at the very least it should have won best original song. https://youtu.be/plUgn_FC0sk&&Whether people like to admit it or not Kristen Stewart has an impressive acting resume, and did way before she was even in Twilight&&Dream dream dream dream dream dreaaaam&&> Lautner was in Sharkboy and Lavagirl

HOOOOOLEEEYYYY SHIT..I never knew this..now I cannot unsee it!&&Bella is a plain jane, boring, one dimensional character. Nobody in the books understands why Edward chooses her because of it. But a lot of people only saw the movies so didn't pick up on that. She played the part perfectly.&&So... a related story about reading books girls like to to talk to them. My cousin was a late bloomer and around 26 he decided it was time to stop raiding in WOW and find a woman and settle down. He signed up for a few online dating sites and matched with quite a few women- almost all of whom had ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" as one of their favorite novels. His best friend, a genuine ladies man, suggested he read them so he would have something to talk to the girls about on their dates. So my cousin starts reading them.

We were hanging out one day not long after he finished the first book and I could tell he wanted to talk to me but couldn't work up the nerve, so I just flat out asked him what was up. My cousin is a virgin and had zero experience with women, even hand holding. His face filled with mild terror and he tells me he just finished the first book and he's freaking out. I'm a girl so it took him a few tries to describe all of the sexual things in the book and in a near panic he asks me ""Misyo, how rejected am I going to be if I can't do all of that stuff? I mean, is that really what chicks want?"" After a pretty good laugh I explain to him that no, women won't reject you for not being Christian Grey (who in my opinion is an abusive manipulative cunt) and wrecking them in bed the first time. Oh, the relief on his face. He was also very concerned that women fantasize about abusive relationships too. So we had a very long talk about sex, fantasies, reality, expectation, and communication in relationships.

Still though, the look on his face was priceless.&&“Read it for a girl”

Lol cmon man, you’re in a safe place. You don’t gotta lie.&& So what happened with the girl? Did you talk about the book? &&yea I think the whole point of her character is to be as vague as possible so teenage girls can project themselves onto her. I can totally see why she played it like that&&My girlfriend and I *just* had this discussion about her after watching Pattinson's new movie Good Time. We enjoy her movies (I think Adventureland is woefully underrated and should be the standard for teen dramedies), but she says similar things about Stewart's line delivery and it bugs her. I can understand the critique, but it comes across to me as more genuine. Her characters appear natural and grounded to me.. like she is an actual young woman speaking actual dialogue (depending on the movie and script of course).

Also, Good Time is phenomenal to anyone who hasn't seen it yet and would make anyone regret saying Robert Pattinson can't act. Makes me excited for this upcoming project.

Edit: phone typing errors&&Stewart took time to grow on me. She's still not one of my favorite actresses but she certainly can still get me interested in a movie sometimes too. &&What film is that? I've only recently seen her in talented roles, and that sounds interesting.&&Well, most people, the vast majority of people don’t watch indie movies. 

I mean shit, Moonlight was an extremely popular indie movie last year, won two  Oscars, and it’s still very rare I meet other people who have seen it. &&Tight blackhole&&Now I have an even funnier picture in my head. &&Without a doubt the best movie experience I’ve ever had, probably the best film I’ve ever watched period. So good.&&I thought the pacing was strange with how it hopped around so much. It was just like England -> Jungle -> England -> Jungle ->England -> Jungle. And the biggest problem I had with that was that the Jungle sequences were basically all pretty  uneventful/interchangeable/boring. Like nothing particularly new or interesting. 

But pacing would for sure be my main problem with it.

&&Oh, like others said the pacing felt off. They didn’t do a great job of conveying that you’re seeing most of a lifetime go by.


I also got annoyed with some of the dialog. The parts where he argues with his wife about what her place is felt so very forced. There’s another part where they are talking about the indigenous people that felt very forced as well. Both scenes felt obviously written by a modern person who is uncomfortable with the social norms of the past. &&https://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gifv&&Holy fuck dude I have never seen another person ever talk about the Man Absorbing Phone.

I still don't know if I hate it or love it, the ending that is, overall the movie was great. &&Understandable. I might look back into thinking of ideas again then. But if any of my fellow redditors decide to try to pitch a movie, make sure you cover your ass with copies and even a poor man's patent in case they say no and then pretend like they came up with it later. &&im telling&&Nice choice. &&Yeah, you're good.&&Sounds different enough, and pretty cool. &&You're solid mate, keep writing.

When Leo first got into acting, his agent told him that his last name sounded too foreign, and recommended that he adopt the stage name Leonardo Williams.

My favorite film of hers is The Runaways.&&I honestly cannot believe it took so long for him to get an oscar. Leonard DiCapriSun has always dominated every role he's taken on. &&[deleted]&&He was never a “pretty boy” in the way, say, Heath Ledger was in his early career. Yes he had a teen girl following due to Romeo + Juliet and Titanic, but he was never considered a lightweight and has been doing serious roles since he was a kid.&&You’ll have to forgive me but have you reviewed Leo’s IMDB recently?  Barring Titanic, he doesn’t do “pretty boy stuff.”  Every role is something that required more than just being good looking.  His looks were just a bonus.  He doesn’t have a single romantic comedy in his resume.  He generally only works with the most accomplished directors on ambitious projects.  He is the best actor we have, pound for pound.&&He was in ""The Beach"" which is an awesome movie.&&First heard this in Mr. Robot. Loved it.&&Didn't expect to listen to the whole thing, that was great&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OydK91JjFOw This song is pretty good as well &&She's beautiful and I love her sound. I actually think that the fact that she's interested in him says a lot about the fact that he's probably a guy worth watching outside of Twilight. This is probably [my favourite from her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFtMl-uipA8). 
&&That was kickass. Doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous either.&&And [here is a picture](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/22/article-0-1AF0A957000005DC-154_638x433.jpg) of Robert Pattinson, Death Grips, and Beyonce. &&HAHA can't believe he's friends with them that's amazing. &&[deleted]&&Wilfred is weird as shit, too.&&> I got Frodo money.

From everything I've heard Frodo money isn't that much.  The guy has to work.  I heard Sean Astin recently talk about how he made like $250K for the _trilogy_.  I think Wood made in the million range; I've heard they've gotten some more money afterwards.  But I don't think any of them had points on the box office or anything like that.  &&Dirk Gently is pretty righteous &&I'm still waiting on a 'North' sequel.&&Or as a creepy cannibal in Sin City&&He was so good in I don't feel at home in this world anymore too. Love that he does these projects.&&And Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin. Despite the shit that happened with that, he still did it more as a passion project&&Thank you for reminding me of that excellent film! Highly recommended for anyone who has yet to see it. &&Bill Murray also delivered one of his best performamces in Rushmore which he did for scale (basically minimum wage for actors). At the time Wes Anderson only had one relatively unknown film but when Murray read the script for Rushmore he was so impressed he offered to work for basically free. IIRC he actually invested some of his own money when a scene got cut due to budget concerns (I believe it was the helicopter scene) which essentially means he paid to work on that film.&&I have never heard anyone say this. Thanks for confirming my bias! ""As humans we must dream. And when we dream, we dream of money!""&&My favorite role of his is in Young Doctors Notebook. A pretty obscure mini series (on Netflix though). &&I thought I was in for a quirky not-quite-a-comedy when I started watching *I Don't Feel at Home...* Right up until the finger incident, anyway. &&Haven't seen the latter but it's on my list. But yeah, some of the films he's worked on are just average or worse but I still think he does a great job in them.&&Swiss army man? Really though? Paul Dano isnt some no name&&Most consider Swiss Army Man to be a good movie.  In fact, it's in A22's lineup, who basically have a perfect record of good movies.&&I want to see Imperium directed by David Fincher.&&Same, it wasn't a good movie, but it was entertaining.&&Horns probably would have, just based on the fact that Joe Hill is Stephen Kings son. &&Swiss Army Man was made on an extremely low budget though.&&Is Oscar the guy who works in the laundromat? &&I'm not lying! 

Watching the movie, on the other hand... That was not done to impress a girl or anything of the sort. That one I watched because I wanted to see it.&&I was far too shy back then for it to go anywhere and the budding romance died as swiftly as it begun.

She did transfer to my high school a year or two later and we became friends after the awkward crush had passed. We still talk on an almost daily basis.

As the lack of a traditional romantic ""happily ever after"" ending probably left you disappointed, you'll be happy to know that she's studying literature so her taste in books has gotten significantly better.&&Glad to finally find a die-hard Adventureland fan, that movie has a permanent spot on my standby list :) Also thanks for the heads on Good Time, definitely going to check it out!&&Tight black hole &&Absolutely&&England is my jungle.&&What did you think of the end?&&> Lost City of Z

In exchange for taking such a low salary, he asked that Disney not cheapen his performance by using his voiceover of Genie for marketing or toys. Disney being Disney agreed to the terms and then promptly ignored those terms so Robin said he didn’t think he’d ever work for “the Mouse” again. 

>”You realize now when you work for Disney why the mouse has only four fingers--because he can't pick up a check,"" Williams told interviewer Gene Shalit. Williams makes a similar comment in the Nov. 22 issue of New York magazine.

>""We had a deal,"" the actor said on the NBC show. ""The one thing I said was I will do the voice. I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything--as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.""

[Here’s the LA Times article from 1993 detailing it.](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/entertainment/ca-60882_1_robin-williams)

I’m a huge Disney fan as I’m sure most people are, but their business practices are frankly terrible. &&IIRC, Robin Williams agreed to do the genie only as a “minor” character, since there was another animated movie he was voicing and he didn’t want that movie to suffer (Ferngully, I think?). So the Genie wasn’t suppose to be a big part of the advertising, but when Disney saw how good Williams was, they disregarded that and made the genie a prominent part of commercials and advertising. Williams was pissed, and didn’t do the voice for the sequel.&&They mistreated the monkey that played Abu, carpets aren't covered by the actors guild so he barely got paid, the desert was brutally hot, the desserts were brutally cold, the actors didn't like sand because it's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere, and Robin had to record inside a lamp for 14 hours a day with no breaks. I guess it was a really toxic set. &&I don't think it's relatable.  The only thing with Aladdin was Williams said he didn't want the genie to be a part of any [promo work](https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Robin-Williams-Has-Special-Clause-About-Future-Aladdin-Sequels-93167.html).  Disney agreed then didn't stick to that agreement.

He did say in the contract he didn't want his unused material used for future films due to legal reasons for his estate.

It doesn't sound like he went out of his way to make the movie just because 'he believed in it.'&&He got Disneyed&&You should check out the movie There Will Be Blood.

He wasn’t allowed to play him in the psycho, depressed way the author wrote him in that book draft from Edward’s point of view that she wrote.

Lets rock John Wick&&The best idea would to have Carrie Ann Moss play a character in the 3rd film.&&I work on the set and managed to sneak this still shot from one of the scenes in the new movie.

[Scene](https://i.imgur.com/PDiiwwF.jpg)
&&But what about Bill and Ted!?!?!&&Just saw #2. It was great and all, but I'm kind of done with that.

What I really want to see is a movie about the guy behind the counter at The Continental.&&John Wick teams up with Atomic Blonde.  Gosh I wish.  &&Great, we can finally figure out if John Wick is going to shoot more people in the head and if redditors will finally accept Keanu Reeves as an action star. &&Am I the only one who wasn’t a fan of chapter two?&&I would love to see an American action series similar to the Bond franchise that is based on this film. A consistent John Wick played by multiple bad asses.&&Cthulhu&&He changes his name to John Constantine and begins to fight the supernatural forces of evil with their own weapons.&&There is a spinoff tv show about the Continental in development. There were also rumours of a spinoff movie called “Ballerina”.&&You ever play Spec Ops: The Line?  He will eventually become so physically and psychologically battered, that he will begin to see real and imagined enemies everywhere, and truly embrace the Baba Yaga name. 

I don't think John Wick will ever truly have a happy ending.  People just keep chipping away at his humanity and what remains of his past happy life.

He will end his story as a physically scarred grotesque parody of a man.  Whose paranoia and anger pushes him further and further from humanity.  He will begin to haunt the city, literally just yoinking random normal people and hitmen off the streets for little to no reason then he will be the Baba Yaga.  The city, if not the world will live in quiet terror of this thing that brutally rips throughs dozens of armed men.  Years will pass, those who knew the person John Wick are all dead or scattered to the winds.  The next generation of international hitmen will not know who this John Wick is, but they will know, fear and respect the entity known as Baba Yaga instead.&&He opens up a pet rescue.&&He finds out the counsel is being orchestrated by Lawrence Fishburn's character, the mastermind of it all. 

As he is about to kill Lawrence Fishburn, suddenly he hears ""stop"" and everything in the room, including the bullets, pauses... except for him and John Wick...

Morpheus: ""You're beginning to remember aren't you?... Neo.""&&So far I love the way they've ended both the first and second ones. Even if a 3rd one never came, we'd still have decent endings. Unlike that new Jason Bourne movie ending which screwed with the perfect ending to the 3rd one.&&I was thinking he kills every life form in the entire world except himself in chapter 3, kills himself in chapter 4 for killing his dog, goes to hell and kills the devil in chapter 5, and then fights every other john wick from every other alternate universe in chapter 6, which concludes phase one of the wick cinematic universe.&&Maybe he blows the whistle to the FBI and testifies somewhere and the movie ends with a small war between the federal government and the assassin-underworld, with John Wick living somewhere, in some house, finally at peace.

Okay, no, it won't. And that sounds kind of lame anyway.&&then...

**John Wick: Chapter 4**&&[deleted]&&probably takes out the high table.&&ManBearPig.&&My bet is that he'll be given an impossible task or a death list or something with the stipulation that if he completes it he won't be excommunicated anymore. He'll do some killing, preferably switch back to HKs instead of glocks, they'll be some gritty action scenes with amazing lighting, hopefully some Kaleida, and the big bad boss will fall but not before fatally wounding Mr.Wick. He'll be so wounded that you'll think he's done for good, screen will fade to black as he bleeds out with his dog next to him, maybe cut to a flash back of his wife, etc, etc.












Then he'll wake up in a hospital inside the continental with a pile of gold coins as payment and a brand new mustang out front for his retirement present.&&He workin' again?&&With a fookin' pencil.&&Yea, but is he back? &&I cant wait to see him kill an industry of assassins. With a fookin pencil&&With the dog? I hope so&&Now I just need to avoid getting a fatal disease or hit by a truck before I can see it.  I don't want to die on a cliffhanger.&&I wanna know how much of the budget is dedicated to guns and ammunition for practice.&&The man is dedicated.  I hear he actually has a data jack in his head, and they have to CGI over it.&&I would buy this. &&does it come with a dead dog?&&> Babayega

This is the guy that plays Finn in Star Wars right?&&I hate how they translated that into ""boogeyman"". Especially the ""man"" part lol. It makes no sense mythology-wise. &&I am excited to see how Chapter 3 goes with every hitman being out for him. We got a taste in Chapter 2.&&Watch the raid and the raid 2 if you haven't. They're just as good if not better imo&&Love 1, the sequel bored myself and wife to tears.  Nothing but meaningless action.  Hope this is a return to form. &&If you haven't seen it and like John wick, see Dredd. So fucking good. &&It's on HBO currently.&&It's not as good as the original but it's still pretty cool.&&If you've seen 1, you've seen 2.

It's not bad, mind, you, but it's simply more of the same, except it doesn't feel stylistically new anymore.  Kind of like the second matrix, except not a bad movie.&&I couldn't really get into it. The movie starts with John Wick getting his car back or something, and the boss of the place is shitting his pants because you know, John Wick and all.. THEN WHY ARE YOU ALL RESISTING?! Just let him take the car and walk out. But no, they all put up a fight, for a single god damn car. 

All immersion flew out of the window and I turned it off. Maybe I was too quick or misunderstood the scene, but it felt really off. &&[deleted]&&'... Light him up' &&He's back.&&SPOILERS








Well every assassin in the world is after him and he’s been excommunicado so there’s that  &&You can pause the movie at almost anytime and get a wallpaper quality shot. It’s amazing &&The crazy thing about those mirror scenes is that you don't ever see the cameraman in the reflection even though all the angles are shown. Insane camerawork.&&And the music.  Man I loved the music&&These two movies were the first I watched when I got my new 4k OLED TV. Hot fucking damn. It looks so bloody beautiful. &&Thanos, I've come to bargain!  Jk.   *headshot*

&&[deleted]&&I'm more impressed by how he walked from the Place des Arts metro station in Montreal to the World Trade Center subway station in NYC while staying entirely underground.&&Shush, the foreigners don't know how that works!&&He's probably gonna go out in a blaze of glory. At least, that's the only way that I can see this ending based on the end of chapter 2&&See, I completely enjoyed the first one.  The second was just ok.  I'm feeling it's a law of diminishing returns here....&&That was the second one. Third one is Return of the fucking pen.&&No no no, the Middle-age Action Extended Universe (MAEU) will involve John Wick, The Equalizer, Taken, The Foreigner, Jason Bourne, Salt, and Paul Blart.&&I mean, the obvious person to bring in for the finale would be Iko Uwais as nega-John Wick and have them get into a kick-ass gun-fight that slowly works its way into knives and then finally hand to hand like a big budget version of Equilibrium's last fight.&&I want to see how John Wick handles the two girls from Knock Knock. &&I've been utterly amazed at the world they've built with John Wick. Can we please just get a ""Continental"" Netflix series or something? Jesus Fuck do I want to know how all these assassin's operate. &&I honestly watched it for Keanu. Wasn't expecting it to be good. I was pleasantly surprised.&&*Time killed his dog. Now, time's time is running out.*&&He's going to kill death.&&2/5 of the Die Hard series is pretty bad &&Die Hard is a brilliant, possibly all-time best, action movie; Die 
Hard is a mediocre franchise. Even Die Hard With A Vengeance is divisive (though I personally love it).&&I’d say the Mission Impossible movies are more of a contender than Die Hard at this point. &&Probably a couple of neon lights on set too&&Hopefully on the shoulder, then he pretends it was another person whilst looking mildly confused. I love pranks.&&Only to discover it was all a simulation? So he time travels back to ask famous people for help to disarm the bomb before the bus slows down?&&It pains me that Payday 2 will likely be the best John Wick game we'll ever get. And this is coming from a guy who put in like 800 hours into Payday 2.

It is also pains me that due to the voice acting, face, and other options (""Do you know what time it is?"") there's like no reason to pick him as your character.&&But he decides to wear sun glasses... also in their team are some new guys... some famous jews... &&Did anyone else notice a huge Payday mask on some screen/poster in the background of John Wick 2 though?

I don't remember exactly but I think it was in the sequence where all the hitmen were getting the texts about the contract on John.&&That's all I really want from it, after all.&&and wears a nice suit at the same time&&Time to update your iPhone iOS.&&Well if John has all the prep time he needs it's no question. You're literally giving him as much time as it takes him to succeed.&&Love all three of these movies.&&The Equalizer is easily one of my favorite movies. I've seen it probably 25 times. Such a good acting flick. And I like Chloe Grace Moretz. She's gorgeous in that movie.

I wish Fuqua would make a sequel.&&Ben Affleck's 'The Accountant'.&&How about John Wick vs The Punisher. Finesse vs brutality&&[*Subtle yet perfect*](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4Yb4GL2)&&From the last thread:

- John 3: Tokyo Wick
- Wick: the Wickier Man
- 3Wick 2Furious
- John Wick: Wick harder
- Wick 3: for a few dogs more&&The Wicker 3: Wild Hunt&&OMG with Morpheus in the second movie it only makes since Trinity would be in the third&&I think you're onto something here. This biggest problem with the second movie was lack of emotional investment. Have chapter 3 revolve around Keanu saving Carrie Ann Moss in some way. Play on our deep nostalgia for The Matrix. That would be a cheap, but effective way to get people invested. &&I think that generated a lot of the allure. The rage was so simple and satisfying. The second film, while trying to expand upon the universe, didn't have that motivation imo. Like I understand he owed a debt, but I never cared tbh. 

I hope they will course correct in that regard for the third film. &&Why did you break my heart like this? &&Thoroughly bamboozled &&Excellent question, dude. I hope that the promised part 3 doesn't end up being dust in the wind.&&Mission Impossible is doing pretty well with that. Tom Cruise would just need to step back behind the camera and let Renner continue. Or even bring in someone new.&&Now we're talkin.&&Now I want this to happen with a new Constantine movie.&&[deleted]&&OH MY GOD. I need a John Wick Constantine crossover movie in my life. Make John Wick the origin story to Constantine.

*After losing his purpose in life, he seeks out religion, and finds ample work for a man of his talents*&&John Wick? No, my name is John Candle.&&And then became a programmer. Eventually, one day, he found out that all the devils he had beated were just simulation errors.&&Psh. And I bet you're going to tell me that after that, he becomes some kind of computer hacker that gains the ability to stop bullets in mid-air. Can you believe this guy?&&Omfg I would pay lots of money for another Constantine&&Then he changes his name to Johnny Utah and goes on to fight surfer bank robbers m. &&“John Wick/Continental Cinematic Universe”&&This would really work as almost an anthology show on Netflix or something. Each episode could focus on a different character staying at the Continental and their own action packed story -- it could really flesh out the world in an interesting way by showing all the different people who could inhabit the crime ridden world of these movies. And then you could have a couple recurring characters like Lance Reddick's doorman character and some Keanu Reeves cameos.&&I'd netflix the fuck out of a show on the continental. &&Ive always wanted to see John Wick from the perspective of the guy he's trying to kill.  it would play out as a horror movie.  For example. Imagine that the movie/show starts with this mobster who gets his way with everything. then one day he thinks he can fuck with this guy who turns out to be john wick. now everywhere the mobster goes, his men start vanishing, they start dying, he hears them panicking over the radios....and its just like a slasher film where John is the killer stalking his prey. 

Like a show where the underworld mafioso are being hunted by John Wick to really drive home the mythos of ""BabaYega"" &&I upvoted you for Spec Ops: The Line. Fantastic mind fuckery of a game.&&I thought that's where the ending of the second movie was going, with him seeing imaginary enemies getting texts everywhere. &&Yea but your forgetting he has that really cute dog. He'll be fine.&&John Wick: Pet Detective?&&Don't have him say ""Neo"", just have him say ""You're beginning to remember, aren't you...?"" and, while showing the effects of time slowing down and a faint Matrix hue taking over, zoom in on John's face and cut to black. End movie. It'd be an awful twist, but it'd be ballsy and I respect that.&&PLEASE BE A CROSSOVER&&Yeah it's where he wakes up at his desk &&Or... he snaps awake from his coma and Gary Busey’s there.

You’re going to follow up an amazing trilogy with a really satisfying ending, end in a cliffhanger that has to be addressed, and then just leave everyone waiting and wondering??&&Ah yes, Chapter 6: John Wick's The One&&If John wick three spends any significant time in court room scenes I’m blaming you. &&I think it’s just a trilogy &&They're doing a spinoff series which Reeves may co-produce but I believe the plan is for that to be an anthology series focusing on a new assassin on a new mission each episode, though we may get cameos by people from the movies like Winston and Charon. There's been some talks about each season focusing on a different Continental location so there'd be an American season, an Italian season and so on and so on until the well runs dry. They can also show how the Continentals grew over time and even do ""flashback"" episodes of historical hitjobs like The Kennedy Assassination for example. I'm cautiously optimistic if most of the main players stay involved even if they aren't involved day to day. &&Just sorting out some stuff, it seems. &&Gas leak?&&A fucking peynceel. &&RIP to that actor . He was great &&John Wick would have had a much more difficult time of it [if only the gang's self-defense instructor listened to his students.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U90dnUbZMmM&feature=youtu.be&t=44)&&Yeah, I'm thinking he's back. &&All the Taran guns he runs in 2 are 2-3 thousand a piece. &&Collectors edition with a Continental coin and a marker and I am sold&&Да&&No that's Bobbyega&&I’m really scared for the dog. The way they ended 2 with the dog chasing after him, breaks my heart :(. &&Yep. How is he gonna handle everybody without help from the Continental. &&He'll become a ghost, hunting down the council.  Only way to stay alive is stay hidden and get rid of the people who put the price on your head.&&I don't think it will be precisely like this.

I think John Wick 3 will encompass a time skip of a decade or so. Most Assassins on earth are too afraid to go after Wick because they 1) can't find him and 2) every low class assassin that went after the contract met a similar fate that the low class assassins in JW2 did.

The big names in the Continental will put everything on the line to send the boogeyman killers again john. (I find it unlikely John is the only ""Baby Yaga slayer"" tier assassin in the Wick universe. He might just happen to have been the best and only public one at the time)

The problem is if they start the Movie IMMEDIATELY after when the events of Wick 2 took place then they need to have a good reason for the low class canon fodder to fuck off and leave John alone. Because for some reason they felt they were strong enough to kill John in the second movie. ['Also the favor the chairman owed to wick will probably be used to bargain for his freedom'] (#spoiler). The real question is what will John have to do before that favor can be called in&&Still waiting for Raid 3. I like the first one more than the second but I'd love a good conclusion.&&Imo John Wick's choreography was way more stylish and sleek compared to The Raid's, plus the world-building just knocks the ball out of the park.&&Dredd surprised the hell out of me. I went in with zero knowledge(of the film, I know the character) and left knowing that a true action movie  was what was missing from my life.&&Yeah it's been on my watchlist for about 3 weeks now.

Still haven't gotten to it.&&I thought it was better. It took everything and ramped it up to 11 without being laughable. It was ridiculous in a way action movies haven’t been since the 90s.&&That scene with the shotgun though, damn.&&My thoughts exactly, and we seem to be in the minority haha.

Near the end it literally just felt like a super cut of him blasting people in the face and it kind of lost its lustre for me. Violence doesn't bother me at all but it all felt over done by the end at the expense of tightening up the writing. Will still probably watch the third one.&&Ah, not yet. That one hour he has is still running. I believe he still has access to the Continental services for that hour too. I could see Arullio showing up with the gear buried in the floor of his house and a clean passport. &&He is not stuck in the world without rules with them. They are stuck in the world with no rule with him.&&[I agree.](http://0.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/64/12/9f3c0caa3a537254694f7e1a8439ee6b.jpg)&&So much wonderful use of color, and the willingness to show off the work they put into it.&&That mirror shootout was just so spectacular.&&It's gotta be CG, right? Erased the camera operators?

EDIT: Had to look it up. The best info I could find was from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14606330/john-wick-chapter-2-interview-chad-stahelski-jj-perry):

> I’d say it was a 60 / 40 split [between practical and digital effects]. We did as much as I believe was humanly possible [in-camera]. We used old-school tricks of putting people [in a spot, and] moving mirrors behind other mirrors to refract that; people hiding under black.&&Holy shit I just realized that. I’ll be looking closely during my next rewatch. &&Digital camera removal. I'm not sure if that's what they did, but I know they did it for Black Swan, and with shots as complicated as that, I don't see any other way. &&sheer *fucking* will&&You gonna tell me the story about him and a pencil again?&&Perfect time for the perfect quote, have an upvote lateralus821.&&He's the boogey-man&&Fun fact: that was shot in the World Trade Center PATH station (which connects NYC and NJ). No subway lines run through it. The subway car interior was also a PATH train. &&The car chase of Ste Catherine, in NYC, was also a bit confusing...
&&As a Canadian I did not notice!&&I refuse to believe his dog won't end the movie sleeping on the bed with Wick after they pickup his repaired car. I can only handle one dead/sad dog per trilogy. &&I liked both. I loved the world building and characters more in 2, but the problem with 2 is that it's so overloaded with action that at some point I just started to get bored. It was like the movie was genuinely afraid that I would get bored if John didn't shoot someone every 4 minutes. &&Second was too much of itself for sure, but it was still a ton of fun. Not enough story compared to the first though. It tried to tell too much of itself through the action than anything. That, and Wick's decision in the end made virtually no fucking sense all things considered. 

The Sommelier(and seeing the extended Continental network) was a great part though&&Ah, yes. Liam Neeson's famous action character, Mr. Taken.&&Basically middle-aged **The Expendables**.&&what id give to see Jackie fight Keanu...

And Bourne fight Paul Blart.&&Also Atomic Blonde, and John McClane&&John wick would destroy Rama with guns. Rama wipes if they fight hand to hand.&&Ooh, each episode could be a different assassin's hit, with some backstory of course and at the end of the episode as they collect their bounty from the Continental, the next episodes assassin picks up theirs.&&I read somewhere back with Chapter 2 had just come out that there were talks about a show around the Continental. &&When i watched the first one, I hadn't heard much about it and just wanted to waste a couple hours on the couch. I was floored, it destroyed my expectations&&Hahahahahahahahaha bravo&&...soooo he's gonna kill himself?





And now I can't shake the image of Keanu in a gunfight with himself, just the gun changing hands and him avoiding it.&&Die Hards 1 and 3 are the only really good ones. Die Hard 2 is just ok, Die Hard 4 is kindof terrible but still fun, and Die Hard 5 is just so god aweful its pretty much destroyed the franchise.&&1/5 of it is bad, imo.&&3/5. Only 1&3 are any good.&&1 is perfect  
2 is forgettable but fine I guess  
3 is great  
4 is bad  
5 is horrid  &&Anyone that says the Die Hard with a Vengeance is bad, is wrong. 

I won’t argue with them about it, they should just know that anything they say will be considered wrong.
&&Not just an all-time best action movie, but an all-time best Christmas movie!&&I've been surprised how much I'm enjoying the series. When 2 came out, I was very upset because I loved the first. But then they took it to where it should always have been. A reflection of the original series.&&Might be at some kind of music venue too.&&I feel like a game like Splinter Cell or something can make a perfect John Wick game.&&John wouldn't even need to kill him. He just needs to live longer, and as weve see how well Keanue Reeves age, he's going to live for another 400 years. &&[He did - it's in post-production](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3766354/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4)

I'd love to see The Equalizer's natural predecessor have a sequel, Man on Fire 2, but...well that's not going to happen any time soon for a number of reasons.&&I kind of like The Wicker Man&&The Fate of The Wicked&&If they ""reunite"" in a church you could say the series is now a holy trinity&&I agree. This is what makes specific things in life so enjoyable - the emotional response. Do you know why many of Tom Hank's movies were such successes? People could relate and understand what his character was going through. He was essentially an ""every day guy"" doing ""crazy shit."" That's what I love about the first John Wick. You could relate to it and be like ""I would totally kill everyone for killing my dog and stealing my car.""&&It's par for the course that the third *unnecessary* film will be even worse than the *unnecessary* sequel. &&Dust. Wind. Dude.&&he might need 2 pencils for cthulhu.&&[deleted]&&I 'member!&&John Wick Constantine Mnemonic. It's almost 2021&&> Make John Wick the origin story to Constantine.

That's the fan-theory. Give it a google - it's fairly fleshed out.&&Reeves is on record as wanting Tilda Swinton in this movie, who played a certain role in Constantine...&&See, you're not thinking big enough. We need to cross over ALL the Keanu ""John"" movies. On top of Constatine and Wick, we have to include:

- John Harker (Dracula)
- John Wall (Generation Um)
- Don John (Much Ado About Nothing. And bear with me on this one)
- John Rain (John Rain. It's on his IMDB, dammit!)
- John Mnemonic (Jonny Mnemonic. I'm going to allow it.)
- John Utah (Point Break) &&White smoking 2 pack a day&&Better, team-up between Wick and Constantine. &&*Juan Candela&&I am completely okay with this as long as it's handled with the same tact that the MCU has.&&Technically that’d include payday 2, hardcore Henry, hotline Miami, point break, and Scarface.

John Wick just shows up out of nowhere and kills a metric fuckton of bad guys and that's it.&&That sounds cool.

It fucked me up good for a quite a while after I finished it. :(&&It really was. It came completely out of the left field as well. When it first arrived on Steam the blurb was all ""YOU MUST MAKE HARD CHOICES"" (like every game blurb always says) but for obvious reasons didn't talk about what was actually going to happen.

The actual gameplay was a bit so-so, but watching your guy just *degenerate* was, well, you said it. A total mindfuck. 

I don't even think the devs have ever made another game since. So it's like some weird, unique experience in the history of gaming, and there really aren't that many of those. &&Not so weird and imaginary when everyone in an extremely crowded part of central park was under his control.&&RE HE HE HE EEEEAAAALLLYyyyy&&Kinda *hot* in these rhiiiiiinooooooos.....&&And then the first screen in the credits: ""Written and directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski""&&Awful?

I'm sure they'll have the cash. They can be really creative and be silly if they like, just not cliche. These movies have that super entertaining non-stop grin feeling where you don't need to take the movie's premise that seriously. It's very good at building suspense, and all the performances have been awesome.

These movies basically constantly break the 4th wall for me because every 5 minutes I'm like fuck yeah they're doing the coolest and funnest shit possible, this is an awesome movie they made.&&Who the fuck does that&&A fookin' bencil.&&Michael Nyquist. Great guy
&&He was PRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCELLESSSS!

I’m in. The deluxe set should also have a bottle of whatever bourbon John drinks. 

Edit: It’s called [Blanton’s](https://thetake.com/product/80286/keanu-reeves-blantons-the-original-single-barrel-bourbon-whiskey-john-wick). It’s a Buffalo Trace product, and a single barrel bourbon at $55 a bottle.

Maybe bring back Alex Winter for a cameo as ""a REALLY old friend"".&&gun fight choreography maybe, but in hand to hand combat no one can top the raid's.&&The whole point of the raid is that it's not stylish and sleek. It's supposed to be brutal, as if they really are desprately fighting for their lives.&&I'm not gonna argue with you but https://youtu.be/kutD5VHUF9U&&Drop what you're doing and watch it right now. It's ridiculously badass. 
&&I liked both movies. Something that bugged me about the the second one was how quick everyone was to go after John. 

Like in the first movie, John Wick is a legend. The first third of the film is him being fucked with and then everyone freaking out about how dangerous he was. The movie goes on to deliver  in the second act and show just why everyone should be scared of even mentioning his name. 

It was such a great build up. Before you see him do anything cool in that movie at least 5 people hear his name and piss their pants.

So in the second movie this same guy, with this same aura of badassery (if anything he should be considered more of a dangerous badass because of how he took out a whole empire in the first movie) is back on the job. And the first hint of a bounty on him literally every secret hobo ninja in new york is trying to take him out?

It just would have been cool to show just how many people were scared of John, contract or not. And the few who went after him were the extra crazy ones. I feel like that aura and legend that surrounded him and was such a subtle awesome feeling went right out the window in the second half of the second movie.

Also based on the second movie I have to assume in this universe there are move assassin ninjas in day to day life than regular people right? &&[deleted]&&I **really** didn't like the bulletproof suit thing. It removed a lot of the sense of danger when he was in gunfights.

Like I know in the back of my head he's got plot armor anyway but part of what makes him badass is him doing all his crazy shit and surviving because he's just *that* good.&&Which makes me worry about the 3rd one. There’s only so far they can ramp things before it all goes too far.&&The first one hits that nightclub scene peak and never can match it in the finale. Plus seeing John just kinda grapple with an old man is kinda lame. 

The sequel is consistently trying new, creative, and clever action scenes. The finale battle of John Wick 2 much better imo but both are so much fun!&&See, and ramping it up is what hurt it for me, personally. I fucking enjoyed the first so much, but I felt the second could have been better with more characterisation and such.&&I hope they start it at exactly the second he starts running and we get to see his hourly preparations.&&I hope they include a line like this where management says something along the lines of he has nowhere to go.  Then Winston says, ""You've failed to realise, John is not prisoner in our domain.  We're held captive in his.""&&Hey that’s a $15,000 cgi turd&&A fucking pencil! Who does that?!&&Yeah, as a Montrealer you could easily recognize the buildings and stores (that Victoria’s Secret lol), felt weird right at the beginning.

Can’t wait for Chapter 3, I’m not usually a big fan of action flicks, but my gf and I really enjoyed the first two movies, Keanu was amazing.&&As an American I did not notice.&&The problem with 2 is that everybody in the world is an assassin and for some reason all of them look at the world's greatest assassin and think, “Yeah, I could totes take him” even after they watched him take down like 8 dudes with a paper clip. 

Edit: I get that you can justify it, but in the first movie, ""John Wick"" is the Name to Run Away From Really Fast and then in the second everybody is like ""nah that's cool I can take him."" I wanted one scene of an assassin getting the notice to kill John and he's like ""Nope! Not for 8 billion dollars dude,"" and he deletes the message and goes back to his morning coffee.&&I also thought the soundtrack was far more superior in the first one.&&I think Halo is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills aleins and doesnt afraid of anything.&&Seems redundant to say it like that...&&OMG WHAT IF JOHN WICK IS CLONED AND HE FIGHTS HIMSELF.&&Was number 5 the one where he rides the F35?&&>Die Hard 5 is just so god aweful

It was the only one of those I saw in the cinema.. ugh. &&I agree, 4 was actually pretty good. I'd give it a 7/10&&Hoping for a return-to-form for #6.&&Eh. 2 isn't *bad*, just kinda forgettable.&&Die Hard 4 was pretty good, just needed that R rating. &&In terms of how well reviewed they all are:

&&Cinematic universes can work if they’re not a forced studio-driven attempt on cashing in on Marvel’s success (e.g. Dark Universe) but develop organically instead (e.g. The Conjuring movies) &&Actually, please do.&&Yeah I'd be down for them as the most bare-bones cameos possible, just the main character of the episode runs into John mid-shootout and he destroys shit and then disappears, like how I imagine people see him in the movies; not how we, the audience, see him when he's the main character.&&you had me at Ian McShane&&How many Americans have you killed toady?

That one line has stayed with me since I first played it. &&That's the part that really sucks. The Devs may never make another game like that. A compelling story with mind fuckery. Those are seriously rare and amazing games.&&That's what's so fucking scary. It's a criminal underworld that does so much assassination and bounty work they have entire uniformed call centers and an underground economy just to handle it all. In a city like New York there could easily be thousands of people to watch out for.

The only way for him to be safe at this point is to kill anyone who could pay out on that bounty.&&Wait for this one. And if it's not done in 5 months, just wait longer. &&I can.&&Just remember where you found it after last time and you’re golden.&&Normal people are lawyers. John wick is..... a closer&&Still probably a good 3 years away at least assuming it finds a network so it's not anything to think about too much until there's a production slate and a possible release date. I can't blame Reeves for wanting to sit back and produce rather than regularly cameo on a TV show even if he's backing it, he's not getting any younger even if he takes good care of himself and I don't think he wants to be geriaction hero trying to do heroic roles in his 60s. &&The director of the movies/show said he would like Keanu to have cameos&&Goodnight, John.

&&I like Jimmy.  Nice guy.&&This seems like it would not work but it totally does. I love these movies for the reasons you stated and Keanu knows his way around guns. He is so badass as John Wick. &&Nah, this time we should have Hugo Weaving. &&Someone, pleaseeee get fishborne a paycheck.&&He is a man of focus.&&[deleted]&&They probably don't even do that. Taran just gets the guns back and then get to re sell them at 10-100x the price because they were the actual guns used in the filming of John Wick.

Win Win for everyone.

Edit* it's the same thing with Blantons, they didn't shop around for a whiskey. Saserac is not out bidding Diageo for this spot. I believe (could be wrong can't confirm) that the producers/writers/directors picked a whiskey they really enjoyed and boom free advertising for a really fantastic bourbon. &&Doing the lords work here&&I'd like a tasting, please.&&Extra bit of special trivia. In the first John wick he drinks the original blantons (tan label) which is available in the US. But in Chapter 2, his hotel room is stocked with Special Reserve (green label) which is only available internationally. &&Bought some purely because of seeing it in John Wick, was not disappointed. 

Little bit of Blanton's trivia: Every bottle has a horse and jockey on the top. There are 8 different stoppers, each with a different letter on it and the jockey in a different position. The stoppers spell out Blanton's and they're supposed to look like a horse and jockey running a race. &&It's also hard as hell to get a bottle in my area...

He got way too much development and was way too entertaining to not be someone who teams up with John. It'll be his debt to John for sparing his life, and I have no doubt in my mind that the blood-contract locket thingy the old dude gave John at the end will come into play. I'm also expecting ""sign language girl"" to make a return as well, since they didn't show her actually dying.&&Clearly Trinity will be a Council member that helps him (fingers crossed)! &&Well Chapter 2 introduced him a bit like an underground, poor man's alternative to McShane's character, who's all luxury and refinement.

Fishburne's character commands armed hobos in the subway and guys who look like they've seen shit. I think Wick in Chapter 3 is going to be pretty gritty and might not be shooting bad guys while wearing an Italian-made suit, this time.&&Idk, I definitely feel like John's life getting spared was a special privilege for his long-standing reputation. Remember that Perkins broke the same rule and got shot for it.&&I love how they're talking about safety and then immediately show the guy welding without a mask.&&The dude in the car seat costume always gets me because it looks so dumb in the behind-the-scenes shots but you'd never notice it in the actual movie.&&I worked 11 hours today. Remind me tomorrow.&&While I liked it, I thought the mirror action sequence scene went on way too long. &&IMO they could have solved this problem very easily. When the assassins are getting the contract for the first time, just give us one shot of an assassin who looks at the contract and goes ""nah"" while putting his phone away.&&Thing is he was out oft the game for a fair amount of time. Maybe a lot of those assassins thought he lost his edge or the stories were exaggerated. Only the people who had intimate, immediate knowledge of him (like the Russian gangsters) truly appreciated how deadly he was. The individual assassins were too arrogant because they've never seen something like him in action.&&Lol it certainly feels like there’s more assassins than non assassins. I absolutely love that. &&> Also based on the second movie I have to assume in this universe there are move assassin ninjas in day to day life than regular people right? 

Literally everyone in the universe is an assassin. Some are better than others and some are really god awful. The peasant assassins aren't even bothered with receiving a text to kill Wick because he'd obliterate all of them so fast. Very few are good enough to earn coins.&&Yep. Completely ruined it IMO. In the first one the Continental was a low-key secret society. Now 90% of the world's population is a part of it.&&...and because all of the henchmen are that bad. Why do they all go running up to John Wick instead of using their gun to shoot him from a distance?&&Just like Superman's lip.&&>fookin beencil


FTFY&&Baba Yaga&&[deleted]&&As a New Yorker, I didn’t notice that. &&I would like to think that there are two classes of assassins. There’s the Continental regulars like John Wick, Perkins, Marcus and Cassian who all know and respect each other. These are the elites that travel the world and fight for seven figure contracts. Then there is a larger group of sort of “working class assassins.” These guys go for small contracts and probably supplement their income other ways, like performing odd-jobs or working for other criminal enterprises such as Viggo’s gang. They’re still part of the Continental, but they’ve never been inside the hotel and know nothing of the big guys. 
They probably had no idea who John Wick was. They just saw the largest contract they would ever see walk by them. &&I actually didn’t mind that so much because i dont really care too much for literal realism in my movies as long as emotions are authentic, and i kinda like John’s reverse arc and the fact that the world wants him dead now.&&IT'S WITH A PENCIL!&&I wonder how many of them don't though. Like everyone got the message but there has to be a few that are like ""John Wick? Pft, fuuuuuck that noise."" I mean with everyone else going after John that's gonna leave a bunch of open jobs for a young smart hitman trying to make some money. &&Yes omg.

"During test screenings of ""The Disaster Artist,"" the biggest comments from test audiences was that they didn't believe it was actually a true story",48432,7j3tnc,http://www.slashfilm.com/the-disaster-artist-writers-interview/,1932,1513014584.0,,"During test screenings of Apollo 13 Ron Howard's favorite complaint he got was that there was no way those astronauts would've survived.&&You know, I once knew a girl who didn't believe this was a true story. One of them found out, beat her up so bad she ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street.&&They left a lot of the crazier shit out of the movie from the book.

For example, Tommy wakes up Greg at one point and has him run a marathon in his slippers and bathrobe. &&That is why I think the way they did the double feature last Thursday in select cinemas was brilliant. You watch The Disaster Artist and think ""That film doesn't really exist does it"" and then watch The Room and ""Holy crap it does and it is a beautiful mess"". I did this first time with both films and had a blast. &&I was dragged to a midnight screening The Room the night before seeing the film and it was the perfect way to do it. Had no idea what I was going to see. &&Oh hai reality&&What are these people, little chickens?&&I just want a movie where someone plays Franco, based on James Franco's passion to make this movie and the making of it.&&Keep your stupid comments in your pocket&&Truth is definitely stranger than fiction sometimes. The Room defied a lot of odds to become fairly well known, regardless of the reasons. &&Which is why they seem to have added the credits side-by-side images showing just how closely they recreated critical film scenes.
&&It's not troo&&It's actually interesting to me how many people I know who don't know what The Room is but want to see this or really enjoyed it. Even after I saw it I thought man this is gonna go unnoticed because while The Room is insanely popular that's only in certain circles. Glad to see more people learning about the mystery that is Wiseau.&&I wish they touched on the darker, more jealous side of Wiseau's personality. 

I remember a point in the book where Wiseau is in a car having a mental breakdown, yelling at Greg because he believes he told someone where he lives. He follows this up by taking several hundred dollars out of Gregs account by cashing a bunch of rent checks at once. &&I sat next to a group of women who all really enjoyed the movie, but they were all shocked when the side by side scenes were playing. None of them knew about the source material but its truly a testament to The Disaster Artist, it was hilarious even if you never saw The Room&&Fun fact. My first encounter with ""The Room"" was back when it was on TV. It was late at night, and I was just a teen browsing for porn on the movie channels. I pretty much watched the whole movie only to realize it wasn't porn... just a really awkward, cringeworthy movie.&&I just want to say how much I appreciate that we got biopics for Tommy Wiseau and Tonya Harding in the same month Guillermo del Toro released a movie with fish man sex.

2017 has been the best year for movies ever. &&I like that movie 'Pain and Gain' that stops towards the end just to remind you ""This is still a true story"" because by that point its just fucking unbelievable.  
  
[Edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t992yxqiqFM)&&I mean it definitely does stretch the truth around what happened quite a bit. The movie premiere scene at the end tries to condense and capture Wiseau's relationship and final acceptance of The Room that evolved over 10+ years into one night at a screening.

Similarly, the Malcolm in the Middle sideplot never happened IIRC and is pretty obviously shoehorned in there to symbolize how Greg's relationship and dedication to Tommy was having a destructive impact on his life.&&Really? It’s not very far-fetched. Some rich foreign guy who doesn’t understand social life tries to make a movie because he’s obsessed with them. &&This was a fun read. (500) Days of Summer is one of my all time favorite movies, so it makes sense the writers were the same on this. 
I'm still blown away by how much I loved the movie. I'm not sure if it's just hype right now, but I thought it was great. &&This movie was brilliant if only for James Franco's depiction of Tommy. It was so impressive, its worth watching just to see that, and the shot-for-shot recreations at the end. I don't really feel like I learned anything about Tommy or the movie or the story behind it (he's weird, nobody knows anything about him, everyone thought he was crazy but went along for the money or just to see the trainwreck) but damn if it wasn't worth it to watch James Franco be able to simply make this movie and do it so true to form. It was a little sad to see Tommy's obviously sad & lonely side and how he really didn't have any friends and just wanted people to like him.&&I definitely have breast cancer&&The story is not true it is not! Is bullshit!&&I just looked at the OP's post history and now I am convinced this post is an ad.&&Where does Hollywood find its test audiences? I swear, 90% of test audience stories I hear, the audiences seem like idiots.&&the biggest ~~comments~~ compliments from test audiences&&Slightly OT but why was the movie called ""The Room""? Is it because the majority of the movie takes place in the one room? &&Well, it's not a totally true story. Greg in the new movie seems to do everything for Tommy out of love and friendship. In reality, Greg was as annoyed and bothered by Tommy as anyone, and if you read the book it's pretty clear he thought Tommy was a bit scummy and was doing all of this pretty much for the paycheck.

That doesn't come across at all in the movie. The movie paints Tommy as a fumbling but beloved guy. The reality is, he was even more of a nightmare for Greg (and the cast) to work with than the new film portrays. 

The kicker is they wanted to get Tommy's approval for the film, so I think they played a lot of this down.&&To be fair, I've watched The Room and still don't believe that it was a real movie.&&Haven't seen the movie but from what I hear, the real Tommy Wisseau hamstrung the depiction of himself. If he's not depicted as a manipulative douche, it's probably not accurate since that's how he definitely comes across in the book over which he had much less control. &&The Room is about to go mainstream, just let that sink in for a second. For those of you who saw The Room years ago even before Seth Rogen and James Franco got in on this project, when you were watching the disaster artist was anyone else as befuddled as I was when you realize that the room was now a real Hollywood movie. Like it set in and I couldn't even believe it &&Well like Red Letter Media said, it's about as true as *Ed Wood.* &&Sadly, if you read the book, you'll learn that much of the movie was fictionalized &&I've never seen viral marketing for a movie as successful as for this one. &&Similar thing happened with George Clooney's 'Good Night and Good Luck'; test audiences complained that the actor playing Joe McCarthy was over-acting (despite it actually being historical footage of the man himself). &&That was my reaction to American Movie. I thought it was a mockumentary.&&Ha Ha Ha... anyway how's your sex life?&&[deleted]&&its not though, they cut out like 70% of the book to make it more ""friendly""

the book was more scathing about the whole production than the movie being all ""follow your dreams and you can make it real""

irl: greg only did the movie because tommy had money

greg didnt like tommy, and tommy was an asshole 99% of the time

in this movie they portray the relationship as if they are ""best friends"" and ironically its just as shallow as the actual movie the room.&&Well, it was fluffed up for the camera. In the book Greg talks about how aggressive and standoffish Tommy was during filming and at premiers but in the movie he's just funny and quirky and instantly accepted that The Room was a so bad its good movie. In real life it took him a long time to come to terms with it. &&I also read that a famous astronaut, I think Neil Armstrong but don’t quote me on that, was so convinced that the special effects of the launch were real shots that he asked Ron Howard, “I don’t remember ever seeing that footage before. Where’d you find it?” Or something to that effect. 

Pretty impressive compliment for the vfx team. &&I saw Apollo 13 at a theater in Maine when it was first-run. After the film,  couple of kids (maybe 19-20 years old) were talking on the way to their car. I overheard one say, “If that’s a true story, they really missed teaching me about that one at school”.&&I love this.

No Adam? :(&&For full effect, do the Audio Book.

The author (Greg/Mark/Whatever), does a better Tommy Wiseau impersonation than Tommy Wiseau.

I never have time for audio books. This was the first one I listened to all the way through. Could not put it down.&&When I reached that part of the book, I realized that Johnny and Mark referred to Bay to Breakers in The Room, down to the barbecue chicken.&&What's this guy's deal?  I've heard bits and pieces of him being kind of a wackjob, but what drives a person to be like this?&&Which order should I see them in? Watch ""The Room"" first and then ""The Disaster Artist"" or vice versa?&&My uncle and I saw Disaster Artist and The Room back-to-back (not a real double feature though). It was the second time I’d seen The Room, and Disaster Artist is really quite helpful to understand things like why every actor looks like they’re about to pass out or why the framing is so godawful. &&If Ive never seen or heard of either. Should I watch the room first? or second?&&It's a great experience. I haven't gone in probably 4 years now, but my wife and I used to go to a screening at a local theater every month. The first time we went, there were like 10 people, but within a year, it was selling out. We never missed a month for nearly 2 years, to the point where the theater presented us with a special award one night, a framed spoon. We took that to another screening where Tommy and Greg were appearing for a Q&A, and got them both to sign it, it's still on our wall to this day.

We only stopped going once a lot of high school kids started showing up and just being obnoxious. It's one thing to throw spoons and footballs and shit, and scream at the screen, make jokes, heckle, have a good time. It's another thing entirely to stand directly in front of the screen acting out every scene for the entire movie, including the sex scenes, and disrespecting this small theater, standing on seats, throwing drinks, just being unnecessarily vulgar for shock value because you're 17 and you think people are impressed by it, etc. So we eventually stopped going. Now that this movie is out, I would expect it to get even worse before it gets better, which sucks because I miss it, I'd love to start going again.&&anyways, how's your sex life?&&haha what a story mark&&You're so beautiful, can I kiss you?&&Don't touch me mother******&&Oh Mark, you're my best frahnd&&It's not true. It's bullshit! &&Oh, there goes gravity&&Cheeeeep cheep cheep cheep cheeEEEeee&&In their defense when has ""based on a true story"" every meant it was even close to real. &&Call it ""The Masterpiece.""&&Repeat that process a few more times, and you've got something that looks a bit like [Synecdoche, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche,_New_York)&&Oh hai Tommy Wiseau &&I actually wanted them to touch more on this line in TDA. Greg was adamantly against saying it and believed it would be the last nail in the coffin in regard to his acting career. 

His frustration in that scene in The Room is real frustration from arguing with Tommy and trying to convince him to drop the line.&&I read the book and the only reason I'm not convinced this was just somebody's acid trip was it that there were so many people corroborating the stories.  

Some of the shit is just so freaking bizarre as to be unreal.&&“The difference between reality and fiction is that fiction needs to be believable”

- Mark Twain

&&The billboard is an underrated reason too. I lived in LA around from 2006-2008 and would see it sometimes driving around on one of the big streets near Hollywood (maybe Cahuenga?). It was this weird looking billboard with these huge brooding eyes. Honestly, I knew nothing about the film whatsoever and I'm usually pretty oblivious to advertising, but it caught my attention and made me wonder, 'WTF is that all about?' 

I figured it was some kind of spooky horror movie. Years later I found out the truth of course, but I honestly think a lot of ""industry"" people probably saw that billboard and had a similar curiosity, which may have contributed to some of the early cult film status. &&It gives me hope that there's a faithful scene-by-scene complete recreation of that film with Francos et. al that may one day come to light.&&Isss buhlshit&&There was a middle-aged black couple sitting in front of us who looked like the farthest thing from The Room fans. Couldn't figure out if they enjoyed it, but, man, I *really* wanted to know what they thought of it.&&They also missed out on easy, easy jokes and scenes. Like Tommy bashed his head on the door frame while filming the ""Oh hi Mark"" scene, making it even more difficult to shoot, or Tommy using the pull up bar on Greg's bed room door at like 4 in the morning.

&&How do you even see the movie without knowing The Room exists...?&&It does have some excessively long and graphic sex scenes.&&The first time I watched it, I was legitimately wondering if it was an awful soft-core porno. It's so front-loaded with sex scenes...&&It was on TV?!&&Also we got get out, dunkirk, it, logan, and a new star wars. &&I especially loved how they did that in The Big Short right before Steve Carrell's blow-up in Vegas.&&[deleted]&&""Malcolm in the Middle"" - Easier than the real life subplot of the whole Retro Puppet Master thing. Summed up a real event with a one minute scene rather than a long arc about Sestero doing that dog. &&I don’t think Sestero bumped into Cranston, but otherwise the role was real, and Tommy did make him turn it down.  Sestero confirmed this at a Q&A. He did admit that a few things were smoothed over for the movie.&&But those things aren't what people didn't believe about the movie.

The unbelievable stuff *is* the real stuff. This guy really spent 5 or 6 million dollars to make the worst movie ever. He really walked around the set naked, talked the way Franco portrays him, refused to let most of the cast/crew see the script, film people and secretly watch the tapes to see what they said about him. He really shot the movie with two cameras simultaneously, did everything wrong despite the genuine advice of his crew, and thought it was one of the greatest movies ever made.

The ending is a bit silly, I'll give you that. I wish there was a different way to do it so it showed the slow cult hit the movie became over the course of a couple years rather than pretending it happened at the premiere.&&In their defense, I still have trouble believing Tommy Wiseau is actually human.&&What do you mean? He's from New Orleans.&&Was he rich when he came to America? I didn't know that part.

Edit: so many contradicting responses lol IDK WHAT TO BELIEVE.&&Are you telling me that Wiseau is the Nichola Tesla of cinema?&&Yeah, as someone who watched The Room 10+ times in college and has shown it to countless people, I was smiling ear to ear the entire time. I love how the focus was on Tommy and Greg, and not just making fun of how bad the movie was. May be my favorite film of the year. &&If you liked reading that, you should check out [James Franco's interview on Fresh Air](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/06/568728129/james-franco-tackles-a-hollywood-story-unlike-any-other-in-disaster-artist) - really cool to know about some of the stuff happening behind the scenes :) 
&&Same here. I expected myself to say ""the book was *so* much better"" or ""*that's* not how it *really* happened"", but it all worked perfectly for me. Only thing I was disappointed in was Half In the Bag's review. They felt... differently.&&>nobody knows anything about him, everyone thought he was crazy but went along for the money or just to see the trainwreck

The book actually goes into that a lot more, actually. They find his birth certificate, investigate his history of residence, present some theories about where his money came from, etc. Nothing's really *proven*, per se, but it's pretty disingenuous to claim (as the end of the movie does) that nobody knows how old he is, where he came from, or how he got the money.&&Don't worry about it.&&I went to the test screening of The Disaster Artist. I thought it was great. There are websites you can sign up to get emails about screenings. There are also people who stand outside of theaters in the LA area that will sign you up for screenings on the spot. The screenings are usually weeknights and anyone can go if you fit the demographic they are looking for. A lot of people just sign up for the free movie.&&The Room was originally written as a play, so it was going to all take place in one room&&I guess it's the room where he kills himself at the end&&I noticed the same, but their explanation they gave in the interview for changing this made sense. Ultimately it's BASED on a true story, and it's still shockingly close. Especially considering the usual standard of ""BASED ON."" Greg was really the only character who was altered. The rest of the difference comes from omissions, which makes sense give just how much material was in the book. &&He's certainly shown as manipulative and selfish throughout the movie, that's where the main conflict resides. Greg is the main character.&&What’s craziest is that if this movie gets Oscar nods, Tommy Wiseau might get to go to the Oscars.&&Interesting how the worst movie ever got turned into a best selling novel which got turned into (what will surely be) an oscar nominated film. &&Sort of. Their complaint was actually the opposite. They said it would've been better if they made it like Ed Wood where they went to an extreme version of events.&&So Orson Welles really gave Ed Wood life changing advice while he was making *Plan 9* &&People are so strange these days&&I’ve got to say Sam Jackson showing up to recruit Tommy into the Avengers was unexpected.&&Or is it proof that the original shots are also fake?!&&It's even cooler than that. They included shots in the movie that didn't exist in the original footage. When they ask the astronauts about shots that we're in the movie only the astronauts seem to remember it like they were in the original footage.&&> I also read that a famous astronaut, I think Neil Armstrong but don’t quote me on that, was so convinced that the special effects of the launch were real shots that he asked Ron Howard, “I don’t remember ever seeing that footage before. Where’d you find it?” Or something to that effect.

And that both Greg and Not-Greg understood what was going on when they saw each other?

So strange&&I was surprised they didn’t include this. The whole two actors shooting Greg scenes for the first couple weeks is one of the best examples of the absurdity that is Tommy Wiseau (IMO)&&wut.

I don't even....

&&> Or when Tommy hired another guy to play Mark but only filmed Greg's takes, leaving the other guy to have to figure out he's not being filmed.

That is just insane enough to be brilliant.&&This was the case for most of actors. Rumour is that Tommy wasn't sure if it was going to be a play or a movie. Reality might be that he couldn't distinguish between the the two. Fact is that he cast understudies for most of the actors as if it was a play and some actors didn't know they were understudies until the day of filming. &&How much are you joking?&&And his affinity for hot water.&&I'm just about to start chapter 18! Audio book is amazing and I just got my copy of the room delivered two days ago. I've already seen it a dozen times but i want to finish the book, watch the room with my wife and then watch the disaster artist with her&&If you get a chance, give the audiobook a listen. It's narrated by Greg Sestero himself, and his Tommy Wiseau impression is even more on point than James Franco's.&&I think that seals the deal, I'm going to go and check out this book. I love the room and I want to see The Disaster Artist. That being said is it worth reading the book if I'm already going to be seeing the Disaster Artist?&&In Wiseau's case it seems mostly like speculation. You have your immortal vampire theories, and then you have car accident theories/brain trauma related stuff. There's always drugs but that's boring and I personally believe that Tommy believes himself above drugs. Or at the very least, he doesn't do drugs,  the drugs do him. You could also argue that he's completely self aware of how bad his movie is and the mindset his accent puts people in, like perhaps he's a comedy genius. I'm thinking Neil Hamburger, Tim & Eric, etc. Then there's always the unfortunately most likely possibility that he's just one of millions of people with a little tinge of mental illness to them that we will never really know about or fix. 

Beyond all that dark shit, I think the funniest scenario is that he's just like any weird guy who loves movies and wants to be famous and sleep on red carpets, what have you. I've always read he used to sell Designer clothes or some shit at exorbitant prices so maybe he just saw movies as another shitty American method of getting 1-2 million dollars at his disposal. But I don't know nearly enough about the way the film was funded or anything. It could come all from his own pocket. &&The Room first.

Hell just go watch some the youtube clips first if you need to&&Here's the elite best ultra order in which you need to see them:

1. About three or four drinks
2. Either one
3. The other one

Edit: After thinking about it I think that getting drunk and going 

1. The Room
2. The Disaster Artist
3. The Room 

might also be acceptable. &&Watch the room first&&Watch The Room first, so you understand more of The Disaster Artist. &&I honestly don't think it matters. I would make sure though you see The Room with people, especially people who have seen it before. It is the only way to watch the film. &&Depends on who you are watching with and whether or not at least one person is open to bad films being entertaining. The safest bet is definitely The Disaster Artist then The Room. Not everyone will ""understand"" or find The Room entertaining without some degree of context of what they're about to see (i.e. people that take movies seriously).&&Watch The Room first. Make sure you watch it with someone so you guys can point and laugh and dissect scenes. &&I made sure to watch the room three times before I went to see The Disaster Artist in this specific formation.  First time I watched it was alone in a dark room with only my dog to hug afterwards (very painful, but necessary), the second time was with one other friend and a fifth of Makers Mark (this time was much more fun),  the third time was the best because I went to a live showing and it was hands down the most rowdy experience I've ever had in a movie theater (this made the first time worth it since I was able to understand the references over all the yelling and spoon throwing), the next night after the live showing I went and saw the Disaster Artist, and it was so much fun to watch after all that, that it literally felt like it was 30 minutes long.  I would highly recommend my method.  &&Mine was an official back to back. I agree I think the films elevate each other in a way. I feel like watching it this way it is like The Room is a fake move with in The Disaster Artist and then you watch The Room and you realize. Oh god The Room is a real movie that people god paid to make. &&Ooh if you know nothing about the Room at least watch some clips of it first. The ""Tearing Me Apart Lisa"" and ""Rooftop scene"" are needed for sure. The Rooftop scene if you have never seen the clip of it is 100% needed for the understanding of the film.&&> If Ive never seen or heard of either. Should I watch the room first? or second?

In my personal opinion, The Room should be watched with zero prior knowledge.

The moments of ""What the fuck am I watching...?"" should come organically... and you will quickly realize that the movie is a masterpiece in its own right.&&I cannaw tell you, is confidenchal&&I don’t want to talk about it&&You can say that again&&You are such a little *brat!*&&I have breast cancer.&&*motherfogger&&Keep your stupid comments in your pocket. &&An I luv Lisa so much&&I'm glad I have a friend like you&&my future wife&&i lose my shit every time he does that&&In my head, when it starts with ""inspired by true events"" I know that it's bullshit. Whenever it's ""based on a true story"" I think it may have been altered or embellished in some way to make it a decent movie. Or the movie is Fargo and it's all bullshit&&Doesn't mark say that?&&In a Q and A i was at Sestero said that if it wasn't a true story they'd ask him to time down Tommy for being too unbelievable.&&Now that the last 2 years happened, nothing seems impossible&&They have 25 minutes of The Room recreated shot for shot which James Franco said will probably wind up on the DVD but sadly they didn't do the whole thing&&I always thought that'd be a fun fan-project, to take the exact script and scene order, and try really hard to make a good film. It'd be impossible, but the results would be hilarious.&&Special feature for the blu ray.  &&I DID NAHHHHHT&&""So, did you enjoy the movie?""

""I did nooooot.""&&Why didn't you ask them?&&I mean it’s a movie with James Franco. Lots of people will go see it. You don’t need to be a fan of The Room to enjoy it. You only need to be aware of The Room to understand it’s based on something real. &&Walking out of the theater after the movie ended there was a very well dressed couple who looked to be about 70 in front of me discussing The Room and the movie, I thought it was so funny. &&James Franco definitely cared about the project and he made an excellent Tommy Wiseau. 

If the movie had a different director it honestly could have been a masterpiece. 

Not that it wasn't good. &&Well it looks like a pretty good comedy based on the cast and trailer alone. I'm willing to bet they'll watch The Room now that they know about it.&&But it lacked penetration.&&It actually used to show every year on April Fool’s Day on Adult Swim. Here’s a couple of bumpers they did with Space Ghost https://youtu.be/xr_fi5I5kjg&&Baby Driver and a new Blade Runner, too.&&I just love Ryan Goslings narration through the whole thing. ""I never hung out with these people, I had fashion friends."" or ""Mark Baum actually did that, Now you see what I had to deal with""&&Its funny. One of those movies that makes you want the villains to get away with it. &&I think he's a Sim come to life &&an all american guy! didn't you see the footballs?&&He's an all-American guy&&That's the thing , NO ONE knows how he got that money which is part of the myth of the movie's production and of Tommy. He put $5 million of his own money into this movie. &&Tommy's story is that apparently he was doing odd jobs and working as a waiter, then started selling factory-defect jeans, then took that money and bought some commercial office buildings and renting out the space.

Are defective blue jeans really that lucrative?  I feel like there's a pretty big gap there.&&Same here, Franco got absolutely lost in the role and every mannerism and cadence in his voice was just spot on. Having seen The Room so many times, it was hard to not be absolutely in love with not just the performance, but how he was displayed as a character.

I saw it with a friend who had never seen it, and he was still laughing pretty hard throughout, but I don’t think he was able to pick up on some of the more subtle nods to the quirks of the movie.&&I felt the same way. My only issue is that I wished they spent more time showing what a cluster F making the movie actually was. But maybe they did and just revealed it in the trailer therefore leaving very little new stuff in that area.&&I’ve never seen the room and just learned what it is after seeing the trailer for the disaster artist. Do you think I would still enjoy the disaster artist or might I be lost and have the whole thing go over my head?&&Ahaha yes you're probably right&&Tommy is the villain?&&There's a petition to try and have Tommy show up at the Oscars if ""The Disaster Artist"" gets nominated.  I of course signed it immediately.&&Well yeah, Ed Wood was a great, surreal fairy-tale of a movie. 

But Tommy Wiseau isn't some starry-eyed dreamer in real life; he's jealous and manipulative and doesn't have the kind of human decency  Franco gives him in *The Disaster Artist.* &&They also recognized that Wiseau probably had a say in how the movie was written.&&that's cute.  you actually believe in the moon?&&But if they're fake, that means Neil Armstrong *isn't* a subject matter expert and his comments don't hold much weight... so it *wasn't* faked?&&It was funny to me, because I was about 12 when Apollo 13 flew. One morning, my mom barged through the bedroom door, threw a newspaper on my bed and said, “the astronauts are in trouble”.&&Haha I read that comment thinking something was off but couldn’t place it. Then it took me another 5 seconds to remember his actual name. 

Good ol’ Charlie Chapland.&&Tracey Chapman's dad&&Dog the bounty hunters cousin&&No, not funny enough. More funny required. &&Dolly had a massive handicap. She's a woman and it was a contest for drag queens.&&Yup. He said 50, his CO said 100, so the official number was a compromise at 75 iirc. &&I'm not familiar. Which movie is this?
&&Ha ha ha, what a story, Mark.&&In the book, after over an hour of shooting that scene, Tommy did one take of him saying the ""what a story Mark"" line without any emotion or laugh, and Sandy found it so weird that he decided to keep the laugh in the end. I think that would've been pretty funny if they'd included that in the movie.&&I'm so happy to have you as my best friend, and I love Lisa so much &&That part of the book was just another time that I felt horrible for Tommy. When Greg says the doorbell ringing made Tommy even more upset was just crazy&&This is what I don't get about the film, they left out all the best bits from the book and then Franco's take on Greg and Tommy's relationship is dolled up in a way that's not nearly as interesting as Greg's account.&&Well, understand that the audience watching *The Disaster Artist* has to be able to wrap their heads around the wackiness that is Wiseau without necessarily being familiar with him or having seen *The Room* half a dozen times— and all while following the plot. Perhaps Franco thought it was a bit much for a film aimed at a wider audience.&&They changed Gregs backstory to have him also be a failed actor. When Greg was actually getting a few decent roles. He was a regular on a soap opera and did some low budget movies. He also didnt want to play mark and just wanted to help the production. Since they changed all that, there was no reason to have the other mark. In the movie Greg agrees to be mark, and no other mark was hired.

I think that hurt the movie a lot. Gregs past was just as important to the story as tommys(past as in pre-room). Yet the movie treated Greg as sort of a side character. The emotional core of the story revolved around Tommy being jealous of Greg and Greg being afraid of failure. Yet in the movie there is only a few brief glimpses at Tommys jealousy, such as his hatred of Alison Bries character. 

Had they kept some of that in, as well as a lot of the characters they cut(seth rogan is a combination of like 5 directors). The movie would have probably won best picture.&&At the very least I thought they’d reference the re-casting of Peter, leading to that guy in the party who acts like he knows them when the audience had never seen him before.&&> best examples of the absurdity that is Tommy Wiseau

I like to think he's the character [Mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxijKCMGUo0) from ""SLC Punk"" and this is just where he ended up in life.&&Well I haven’t seen the movie yet, but in the book Greg does not want to be in the movie at all, until Tommy offers him money. From the trailers it seems like Greg is excited for it. So that discrepancy means they couldn’t include what actually happened.&&It's kind of the other way around. Tommy didn't like the original Mark and convinced Greg to take the part by offering him a ridiculous amount of money. His plan was to say that Greg was just doing a test shoot by the request of the ""investors"" (there weren't any) and just pretend he was filming the scenes the other guy was doing, needless to say everyone on set figured out what was going on almost immediately.&&Not at all. Tommy notoriously would not let a valet at a restaurant drive his car because he was afraid he would fart in his seat.&&My favorite wacky theory is that Tommy Wisseau is actually [D.B. Cooper.](https://xkcd.com/1400/) &&I watched the Room for the first time recently. I knew I'd watched a lot of clips on YouTube before, but didn't realise I'd seen at least 80% of it. It actually made it better too, because i got to realise the context, or lack of, around those clips.&&Oh, hi youtube&&[Here's a compilation of some of the best/most noteworthy clips from the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIDa8sIWeW0)

But I dont wanna ruin it before I see it!&&I kinda disagree. Those scenes are good for gauging of its in your sense of humour. But they don't reflect the film as a whole. It's far more shitty than it is funny. Those moments stand out. They aren't indicative of the whole film. &&I saw The Room before it was everywhere just because I knew people who love bad movies. Of course, I loved it and when I started making films of my own I put 100% in everything I did and just hoped that it would either be good or such a fucking disaster that it would be great. &&no mickey mouse operation&&Youairlyang.

It wasn’t until season 3 started and I commented again on that true story title card and my parents finally go “honey I don’t think it’s actually a true story, they did this with the original Fargo too.”&&I really hope James had the entire cast secretly filmed on an old video camera during production, just like Tommy&&They should just do it.

How did he get the money?  In the book Sestero makes it clear that when he met Tommy he thought that his claims about having money were total bullshit bragging, but he was continually amazed he not only backed it up, but had more than he told Sestero.  

Somebody knows.  But I'd guess if you knew how he managed to come up with 6 million (at least) to make his movie it would lose some of the appea.&&Such a publicized story with notable gaps, how the fuck hasn't the IRS jumped down his throat? He doesn't seem like a criminal mastermind. 

So either he's telling the truth or he's a criminal mastermind. Either way, I want to see a movie that covers how he rose up against all odds and got his fortune only for it to end with his life's work being a big joke. &&Yeah especially when you fill the pockets with cocaine, very lucrative. &&I mean is that really a leap in logic here - he was waiter, saved money, bought and resold defect jeans, saved money, bought commercial property and leased it, saved money - I think people are focusing too much on the jeans and less on the real-estate part.&&They definitely skimmed over Tommy holding Chris R.'s check hostage, Kyle Vogt leaving the shoot due to them neglecting his previously stated availability and being subsequently replaced and some of the darker aspects of Tommy's manipulative behavior. Had a total blast in the movie though, but I will forever dream of the David Fincher/Paul Thomas Anderson version that I was hoping for.&&fairly sure tommy said he's going to reveal more information in a follow up book, probably part of his deal signing all the rights over to franco. the mysteriousness from it all is what is bringing them in the money, and keeping the audience in the dark by omitting as much as possible without compromising the stories entertainment is all they can do&&I've never seen the room and I thought Disaster Artist was great.&&Watch the room. Get some friends together and have a blast &&I am Hero!&&> Tommy Wiseau isn't some starry-eyed dreamer in real life; he's jealous and manipulative        
      
I get what you're saying, but can't he be both?&&>he's jealous and manipulative and doesn't have the kind of human decency Franco gives him in The Disaster Artist.

Seth Rogen was on the Nerdist podcast, and he talked about how they sort of had to make Tommy more likeable - simply because otherwise the movie would seem too mean-spirited, like them just making fun of someone who made a shitty movie.

&&Adorable.  You believe in belief?


Wake up sheeple.&&The moon is flat and everyone knows it.&&this is so fucking meta lol i really do hope it catches on&&We got a moon truther here&&The moon is a hoax perpetuated by big cheese lobby to sell sharp cheddar, stay woke. &&This reminds me of the John Mulaney Princess Diana joke.

https://youtu.be/K2di4q7ZpiM&&""You have to save them, son""&&really?  That's how you are spelling Charlee Chapland?&&Somebody's got to take care of him&&Its called [To Hell and Back](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048729/)&&Okay look. This story- which *you wrote*- is not a funny story. This is a serious scene. Let's try this again, and no laughing this time.&&[deleted]&&They needed Tommy’s permission. No way we were going to get anything more then we got. A really true to life story would have painted tommy as a very sad asshole individual.&&I heard an interview with the screen writers and they said the hardest obstacles they had to over come was understanding why Greg went along with these shenanigans for so long - thats probably why he seemed little more ""excited puppy dog"".

They also said that as they got to know Greg in real life they realized he was almost as weird as Tommy is.&&It’s sweeter and more uplifting that way :)&&No, the issue is that Franco wanted Tommy to be the star of the movie when he really should have been supporting Dave/Greg. Tommy is way too weird and erratic to be a lead character so they took out a lot of his strange behaviour  to make him more palatable. 

In any other version of this movie, Tommy is the sympathetic villain. &&The room has a plot?&&The movie really felt 20-30 minutes short.&&I REALLY wished they'd kept more of Greg's character intact. He was so afraid of failure- a fear that we see mirrored in some of Tommy's strange behavior (fear of being abandoned by Greg). 

Also, Greg really didn't want to do the movie, and his reluctance makes it all the more hilarious. You can definitely tell in some scenes of The Room, where Greg has just HAD IT with the movie (I'm thinking of the party scene).&&Yeah he got the lead in some horror movie sequel according to the book. I think it was Puppet Master. Got some decent money and exposure for that but it didn't boost his career like he thought it would. Honestly the book kept me laughing all throughout. Did prefer the book to the movie but understand why they had to leave some details out. Good call out on Seth Rogen's character too. Forgot that detail.&&> Had they kept some of that in, as well as a lot of the characters they cut(seth rogan is a combination of like 5 directors). The movie would have probably won best picture.

Honestly, that wouldve just bogged down the movie. You can't transfer a book to film exactly identically, there are just certain things that need to be cut, and sometimes added or changed to have the story work in that medium. I feel like if the movie had kept all that, it would have made the movie much slower, and much more clunky, and not have been as good of a film.&&Ok. That makes more sense in a Wiseau way.

The other idea that he hired a Mark2 and then didn't use him at all os too bizarre.&&wait, so Greg was originally not cast at all in the movie?  That seems strange for how much they pumped up their friend narrative and like they were doing the movie together.  &&I really need to read the book.&&It's funny because you watch the clips thinking that those are just the worst parts of the movie. Then you watch the movie and realize the entire movie is the worst part of the movie!&&first time i saw it was senior year of high school with a big group of my friends and i wish i could give everyone in the world a chance to have that exact experience. what a magical film&&And make sure you turn it into a drinking game&&My first experience with it is the reason I love it so much. A friend of mine convinced me we were going to see a great indie flick. We show up and it’s a midnight showing of the room. It was amazing. Spoons for days. &&I've only seen bits and pieces. I have access to some pretty good acid. Should I go headfirst into it sober or tripping? I feel like sobriety might actually augment the ridiculousness of the work, but I want an experienced opinion before deciding my gameplan. &&If you watch it first with a huge group of people at those big events, you will get confused and miss out on certain bits of dialogue and etc because of those audience rituals that have become common.

So I think suffer through the Room in its pure form and then get in on the fun with the groups.&&Where can I find it?  Netflix?&&I assume you're going to follow Tommy's advice and watch the movie *at least* twice. 

Actually, yeah. The first time I saw The Room (and every subsequent time), it's been at an audience participation screening. First time I was kind of annoyed when I missed lines because people were screaming...But now I know it doesn't really matter.&&I've seen The Room a couple times and saw it for the first time in theatre (Greg Sestero was there too) 2 weekends ago. Heed this advice. Even though we were fairly close to the back we were getting hit by spoons. &&Almost half the point XD&&The Room IS a psycho active substance.&&Oh hai, liver failure.&&My reaction to that (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Qdoxy5pUA)&&I watched “The Room” recently for the first time in preparation for “The Disaster Artist” and I can say, without a doubt, that if I hadn’t know it was reveled for being so terrible I would have turned it off. 

It’s equal parts porno-level acting terrible and also gas station d-list actor movie. 

It was magical. &&I think The Room is so widely loved because it's a **perfectly** watchable bad movie. A lot of bad movies like Manos: Hands of Fate or Plan 9 From Outer Space just end up being boring most of the time but movies like The Room or Troll 2 are just laugh-a-minute terrible.&&Saw it in college when I was an RA on a freshman floor. Kid pulls out this rando movie and I’m like, “the fuck?”

He did every single midnight tradition, shouting “SPOON!” Whenever one showed up, chanting “boom boom” in time with Lisa’s footsteps— it was awesome!

If I’d been alone, I don’t know if I’d have enjoyed it as much. &&Did God even get a producing credit for the film? If he did nahht, it's bullshit.&&People God. &&The Room is literally a gift from God&&Make sure you watch them with people. I feel like watching The Room alone you just won't get why people love it. I had never seen it but knew a lot of the memes from it. As long as you know the Rooftop scene/I did not hit her scene (googling both should bring it up) you will be fine for The Disaster Artist. The Room is an experince truly with people. One guy in my theater counted the minutes between sex scenes, there is an overwhelming number for a 99 minute movie. &&There's a 10ish minute ""Best of The Room"" youtube video. I'd link but I'm on mobile. It's the most infamous scenes and gives you a good idea of the movie if you don't have the time/motivation to watch the whole thing!&&>  hoped that it would either be good or such a fucking disaster that it would be great. 

That's the spirit. 

But it's important to note that people that make intentionally bad movies are the worst kind of lame. Ex: Sharknado....&&[deleted]&&Oh hai Mark&&Hesuh-kay. Aystel luhfyu. &&hahaha what a story mark&&Tooze grate but three's a crowd *hahaha*&&I feel like it get lost in the mix of other insane shit, but no one ever really talks about how creepy Denny is at the beginning.  &&Look, don't worry about it.  Everything will be fine. &&Poland? Where's that? Close to New Orleans?&&In your defense, they don't just say ""based on a true story"" - they give it a hard sell. 

>This is a true story. The events depicted in this [film] took place in Minnesota in [1987.] At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

They really double-down on the misdirection. So don't feel too bad :)&&[deleted]&&Not even the UFO was the tipping point?&&The interview extra on the DVD might honestly be the best part. Especially the question about playing football 3 feet away from each other. &&Anyways, how's your sex life?&&Oh hai mark.&&That's a pretty safe bet when talking about an online comment&&I've seen the room about 15+ times since 2010 and I will say that scene is probably my all-time favorite. The fact that he seems to be pre-empting the shopkeepers words and almost like talking over her but responding to her questions? Also the immediate hi doggy and the hi jonny I didn't know it was you (oh the fuck you didn't?) Always get me laughing so hard. &&and I have yet another reason to love that movie. Thats fucking great. Out of curiousity do u know if they added in the gosling narration after they got the notes? or was it all planned that way&&[deleted]&&Best bets are that it was tied up in a building he owned.&&From the book ""The Disaster Artist"" that's the official line. I had heard before the book it was made through illegally importing knock-off leather jackets from China. I'd imagine its a mix of both.&&Wiseau did own a clothing store, Street Fashions USA, that's no secret. But yeah there's no way he made that much money off of it. And he owns some real estate. The bigger question is where he got the money to start this business and buy this real estate.&&Some think he was injured in a car accident and received a large settlement. Head injury of course.&&Greg doesn't think so, he can't imagine that any criminal would want to work with Tommy. Plus this guy is a public figure, his money is no secret, so I would think that the feds would have gone after him if he was doing something so illegal.&&He filmed the movie on two different cameras strapped together (That's why nothing is properly framed) and hired two actors for each role. the guy had no idea what he was doing but knew exactly what he wanted to do. Its almost beautiful.&&most think it was over $6 million by the end. But no one knows for sure obviously.&&So from what I gathered, Tommy Wiseau is *at least* one of the following:

D.B. Cooper

Rasputin

A vampire

The Zodiac Killer 

*edit: that means he is an older time traveling Ted Cruz that somehow got stuck in the past, probably due to the two car accidents ""Tommy Wiseau"" had, which would also explain why he doesnt look like ted cruz now*&&>edit: none of these people looked like millionaires though, so probably not

Well, Tommy doesn't look like a millionaire either so...&&How do you know the IRS hasn't? They don't like

And the book.&&>In any other version of this movie, Tommy is the sympathetic villain. 

Isn't that ambiguity the crux of his character in the film? Like... they straight up say it in dialogue multiple times.

&&I think a big reason for this is that Tommy had to approve anything that happened in the film. &&Tommy is no villain. He true American hero&&I'd add that the reason James Franco made Wiseau the star of the movie is because Franco clearly absolutely loves ""The Room"". Wiseau has to be the hero, perhaps a talentless and pitiable hero but still, the hero, because he gave the world this movie that Franco loves so much. &&He's a Frankenstein&&Im thinking there will be a huge director cut. I think they basically remade all the scenes in the room. They clearly refilmed Chris Rs scene on the rooftop, but didnt put in the scenes of them filming it. &&the book is honestly one of my favorites of all time. Its funny, sad, and surprisingly inspirational. &&>Yeah he got the lead in some horror movie sequel according to the book. I think it was Puppet Master. Got some decent money and exposure for that but it didn't boost his career like he thought it would.

One thing I learned from the book is that you can have the lead role in a real film (Retro Puppet Master) and a bunch of small roles, but still be completely struggling and unable to advance your career after those roles are over.&&they could have cut all the girlfriends scenes as well as the made up scene where Tommy is in a second acting class or at a restaurant yelling at a guy eating dinner or the scene with the celebrities raving about the room, or even the scene with Bryan Cranston. 

All of those really did nothing for the movie. The girlfriend was there for jealousy(which would have been done better with him succeeding at acting and tommy failing), The malcolm in the middle scene wouldnt be necassary if they included those scenes from the book as its basically the same in the book(Greg shaving his beard means his face is in the production, and he knows it will kill his acting career). 

I know you cant transfer a book identically, but you shouldnt cut character development for filler. &&Wtf. You’re telling me hiring two guys and only using one for the same role is more insane than hiring 2 guys and tell one of them that he’s playing the part  even tho he didn’t want to while telling the one he wanted to play the part that he’s just doing it a “test” and leave him completely out in the dark until he realizes he’s the actor That tommy was going to use from the very beginning.  &&Greg was originally doing a bunch of other stuff on the movie (casting and producing) and he continued acting as line producer and several other production roles throughout the filming process after taking over as Mark&&Get the audio book. Greg (guy who plays Mark) does a spot on Tommy. &&EXACTLY! I was showing some friends the top worst moments of the film on yt and midway through realized that it was literally the whole damn film recapped.&&I think what makes the room great is that it snowballs on you, right. It’s like other “bad but funny” movies have some weird CGI moments or dialogue moments here or there. But not like the room. 

One of the things I liked about The Disaster Artist is near the end when everyone is watching The Room premiere. It starts out as everyone cringing and thinking “man this is so bad, how can this movie be so bad, what were they thinking” and then it just snowballs to a point where you can’t help but cracking up. 

I guess that’s technically the point where a “bad movie” crosses into the realm of absurdist/surreal humor?&&[deleted]&&Bring your plastic spoons!

Throw them around the room every time the spoon picture is on screen&&And it's best played with scotchka

&&spooooons! My first experience was similar, but it was at my university's movie theater and Tommy and Greg were actually there 😂. I'd seen clips online before then, but never the whole movie.&&Don't waste acid on something perfectly enjoyable sober &&Enjoy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyXkZldOYg&&Unfortunately it's only available (legally) on DVD. Tommy retains all the distribution rights so all DVD purchases are sold through his company.

I have no idea whether this is a typo and you meant to say ""reviled"" or ""reveled"" is actually what you meant. Your comment works either way with two very different words and that's amazing.&&I never thought about it like this before, but you're spot on. Most genuinely awful movies have long draggy boring bits, but with the The Room it's just one transfixing cinematic car crash after another. &&Now you have to up the game and dive into [Neil Breen](https://youtu.be/u-fYWAwc8Q0)&&I don't think you need to see it with other people to enjoy it on your first watch. Other people help with talking over the really fucking boring parts, but the lunacy of the juiciest bits definitely didn't elude me the first time I saw it. The Disaster Artist doesn't even touch on certain subjects, like the fact that Tommy's voice is dubbed in for (almost?) the entire movie - and poorly. I guess you couldn't understand him on camera, and since he's so... Talented... He couldn't reproduce his own voice. While there are scenes dripping with hilarity, there are also scenes that are simply bad. They're not funny, they're just poorly executed.

Tommy Wiseau almost makes more sense as a very dedicated joke than the real story. He's also infinitely more entertaining than just his movie.&&https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WXEuzulOM9Q

This seems to have it all.

And you know what? That's the American Dream. That's practically what Hamilton was written about. So I think it's funny that Tommy tried so hard to represent himself as this all American guy when (if it's true) his real story is pretty core to American values to begin with. &&Don't forget that he also spent money CGing the skyline that he easily could have gotten from one of the buildings he owned. &&He also straight up bought the cameras rather than just renting them.&&It's like if an alien came down and was hired to make a ""Hollywood Movie"" but was limited by what little he could understand about movies.&&Two cameras *which he bought,* one HD and the other 35mm. &&I've always been too lazy to Google why but maybe you will know the answer.

The other possibility is that he got it illegally but IRS hasn't been able to nab him, and if that's the case HOW?

It seems like he got all this money after coming to the States unless he was rich before and is lying about all the odd jobs and jeans sales in the US.&&Yeah, but I'm talking about years here, the guy was like 40, or even mid 40's when he filmed The Room, so its a life time of work. It's guessed that he made it to Paris around the time he was 14, and lets say 18-20 he made it to the US, and lets guess he was 43 when he reached financial security that he was allegedly chasing all his life - then stopped to chase his dreams. 

He was also an entrepreneur in a way he bought and sold toys, or whatever for a while.

Haha, well put&&Tommy Wiseau is a genuinely weird guy who somehow achieved total control over a movie.

FTFY.&&no mickey mouse&&Because it was. Almost all the audio was ADR, I think. This is most obvious in scenes like the flower shop.&&A lot of it was, mostly involving Tommy. Rumors are that he was either so unintelligible that they had to add in his audio later, or he just couldn't memorize his lines. &&I believe he was a perfectionist (I'm not sure how), or at least someone who tinkered a lot with his work.  From what ive learned there are 2 main reasons why it was dubbed so frequently. 1. He didnt properly capture his audio because he had no clue what he was doing and/or 2. He recorded his line repeatedly to make him sound more ""American"". Johnny is supposed to be an ""All American Guy"" and he was obssesed with making him sound correct. &&Because it was. Most of the audio recorded on set was unusable. &&I forget what podcast it was but I remember them saying it had to do with Tommy wanting to sound like "" all American guy' as possible. &&Nextquestion&&That is something D.B.

man, some people work hard *and* get in the right market at the right time. there are plenty of people that started off with nothing, literally fucking nothing, and are worth millions of dollars by 40.

My best friend graduated college about 10 years ago, we are both 32 now. He didn't have anything, he wasn't an illegal immigrant with literally no cash at all, but he was raised in a home where his parents barely made enough money to be over the poverty line. They might have qualified for food stamps, actually. He was probably worth $500 with $30 or so grand in student loans when he graduated.

Anyway, he is worth about $1-2mil right now, easily could be worth $10mil by the time he was the age Tommy was when he made the Room.

Anything is possible, it's always a mix of hard work and luck.&&Me too. It took the end credits before I realized that was Zac Efron playing the guy who plays Chris R, though! I also loved Josh Hutcherson as the guy who plays Denny. Brilliant. 

Lol me having said that is soooo ""Tropic Thunder""-esque, I love it.&&THANKS IS NOT REQUIRED. ALL WILL BE ASSIMILATED INTO THE MEME COLLECTIVE. RESISTANCE IS NORMIE.&&water story mark&&Cut. Moving on. Check the gate. &&It's not wrong, but it misses a lot of what makes Tommy so interesting, I think.

From Greg's account in the book Tommy seems like he's maybe 2 steps away from becoming Annie Wilkes in real life. 

The movie brushes past it but a significant  point in the book compares Tommy to Tom Ripley.&&I'd add that it's the depiction of a truly *strange* person's passion without any actual talent.&&Or just an extra feature on the dvd&&I've been saying this for weeks! If you like this whole train wreck, you really owe it to yourself to hear Greg doing Tommy; it's great.&&Well, he IS a clown.&&What are you, chicken?&&Your rule plus:

Every time the door opens 
 
Every time someone says don't worry about it 

When someone says I don't want to talk about it 

When there's a shot of San Fran as a transition 

When someone says Lisa is sexy or beautiful 

When someone references Johnny and Mark being best friends 

Plus take a shot for ""you're tearing me apart Lisa""

You will get fucked up so quickly. I didn't know there was a fourth sex scene in the movie for  *years* due to this game. 

&&Way to give a cunt a brain hemorrhage though &&Chip chip chip chiiiiiiip&&I definitely see that without an introduction. I already knew the general reputation of the movie when I saw it.

New Poster for Wes Anderson's 'Isle of Dogs',48253,7kvaly,https://i.redd.it/6m1f5dg0dx401.jpg,1084,1513709259.0,,"> Isle of Dogs tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, twelve-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi. When, by Executive Decree, all the canine pets of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast garbage-dump, Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies to Trash Island in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel friends, he begins an epic journey that will decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.

Somehow I find the name Spots too cute for a bodyguard dog, and the fact that Liev Schreiber is voicing that dog makes it more interesting.&&Wes Anderson is making a movie about Millwall?

Oh, wait, an island of dogs. Never mind.&&Yup, that's a Wes Anderson poster. This gon' be good. Info for those wondering:

**Description:**

Set in Japan, Isle of Dogs follows a boy's odyssey in search of his dog.

**Written By:**

Wes Anderson

**Release Date:**

March 23, 2018&&""Isle of dogs""

I love dogs too!&&before reading the description, I was worried that this was going to be Battle Royal, but with dogs.&&I'm always excited to see a new Wes Anderson flick, after Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Moonrise Kingdom (I highly recommend), this film especially looks quirky, and a must see! &&That looks awesome. 

Except my brain is screaming because Dogs in in the character for Shima(isle) and Isle is in Inu (dog).

I know, I know it wouldn't make sense in English....&&The filmmakers shared this through the [accidentallywesanderson.com](http://www.accidentallywesanderson.com/) community.&&Anybody got a textless version of this?&&r/mildlyterrifying&&You had me at ""Wes"" &&Is there really no Shiba? &&[This dog's face](https://imgur.com/P08tIR4)&&Hey everyone, what's your favorite Wes Anderson movie?&&For a man who is known for killing the dogs in his movies, I'm expecting some kind of war themed movie with a high casualty rate &&Love his films, but the SNL parody is too good. &&In Japanese that's actually dog island. 

The English words overlaying the Japanese is backwards. Just saying FYI. && https://i.imgur.com/hmALnTl.jpg &&Well that's just goddamn horrifying &&They should just say “have you seen a Wes Anderson movie? That’s pretty much who’s in it”&&Middle right. “His name... WAS ATREYU!”&&Honestly this can be a movie about dogs rolling in the grass for two hours and I would see it in IMAX on opening night&&That poster looks like an ad for a dog MMO.&&Come on, I gotta say it: Those dogs look really creepy. Just like in Fantastic Mr Fox, those puppets don't look like they're made to be looked at from up close.

I am not saying that they have to be Disneyfied. But seriously, is no one bothered by this?&&All of these dogs look homeless.

  You too can save a puppies life for less than then the price of a cup of coffee a day. Call now.
  &&""set in japan"" Stars one japanese person.&&I really really am looking forward to this.

Wes Anderson movies have supplanted my excitement for Marvel movies. I get excited for Marvel movies; I get *giddy* for Wes Anderson movies.&&Man, this poster gives me Labyrinth vibes...&&I'm glad the Bee from Bee Movie is still getting work.&&I'm getting some Fantastic Mr Fox creepy close up shot vibes.



I did really enjoy fantastic Mr Fox and am excited for this movie aswell.&&r/NotAccidentalWesAnderson&&And that, ladies and gentlemen, is all the advertising I need to see. &&[deleted]&&['Isle of Dogs' Official Trailer](https://youtu.be/dt__kig8PVU) &&https://youtu.be/dt__kig8PVU

Trailer in case anyone is looking.&&Nope&&Wes Anderson movies make me happy.&&Fantastic Mr Fox is one of my favorite movies of the 21st century so I’m really looking forward to this.&&I want to see him and Neils Blomkamp collaborate on a film.&&Is that the mechanical dog from the second Kingsman movie in the top left there&&Bork.&&There are a couple of dogs on that poster that have seen things. Terrible things. &&Nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador peninsula. &&As someone who prides in owning every Wes Anderson film, I'm so excited for this film.&&Yeah, gonna have to call bullshit on this one. That's clearly Falkor on the middle left.&&Does anyone see a yorkie?   This halfassed bullshit these motherfuckers are getting a letter from me.  Itll be hard as fuck to read too.&&Isle of Dogs.  Why is this not set in darkest east London with a cockerney kid and a local gang master?  &&Wes Anderson is making a new movie? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa *intense fanboying* moonrise kingdom is my favorite movie I literally fucked a copy of grand Budapest hotel&&Saw this trailer recently, on Friday night with a full house at a massive screen.  Not a single laugh.  Awesome :)&&I see no Basset Hound. You will not get my money Wes until I get the assurance of at least one in this movie.&&I used to love Wes Anderson when I was a budding teenage hipster. Now, I'm SO SICK of the formula. Sure his movies are unique if your frame of reference is Hollywood in general. However, if you compare his movies to the whole of his filmography, they're generally the same formula in different settings/mediums.

A) Lead male character with a shit ton of unwarranted confidence 
B) Female love Interest with deadpan delivery of lines ""darn. I think I have a crush on you""
C) Adventure/quest
D) Tragic death/setback
E) Bittersweet happy ending 

This movie is no different, it seems. I feel like it's Fantastic Mr. Fox all over again, except with dogs - especially since George Clooney is the main again. 

Overall... meh &&[deleted]&&/r/deliberatewesanderson&&'Tis like a Gary Larson wet dream. Every dog looks wonderfully individualistic, yet they are all probably thinking, ""Hey!"".

A Wes Anderson movie can never arrive soon enough.&&Isle of dogs.
Isle. Of. Dogs
I. Love. Dogs…
Son of a bitch&&That’s a lot of g o o d b o y e s&&Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my all time favourite movies. Another stop motion Wes Anderson movie is exactly what I want&&One of my favorite quotes from a Wes Anderson film ""I think we're just going to have to be secretly in love with each other and leave it at that, Richie."" &&Gross&&I love dogs bit those eyes in the poster freak me out&&I don't know man, the one at the bottom seems to be faking it.&&Here's the trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt__kig8PVU

&&Never understood a single one of his movies. &&I love Wes Anderson films. But I can’t be the only one who hates that typeset on the poster. Feels like someone copied and pasted English in the kanji strokes using MS Paint.&&/u/jav099 esto se ve fabuloso &&!Dreambot&&I wish this animation style wasn't creepy as hell to me, but it just makes me feel like I'm in purgatory&&I love dogs, but I will never, ever, EVER watch this movie. The animation alone has me running for the nearest hidey hole.&&I love his movies but Wes Anderson is one of the people who signed a petition asking for the charges against child molester Roman Polanskis to be dropped, so I won't be paying a cent to see this. Probably will pirate it.&&After watching the trailer I can’t tell if this is a Wes Anderson movie or a parody of a Wes Anderson movie. &&Get back to me when it's Wes Craven's.&&r/AccidentalWesAnderson but on purpose&&Am I the only one who HATE Wes Anderson's movies? I can't stand his visual style and quirky dialogue. &&Don’t care.&&But I don't like Wes Anderson. &&One of those cliché 'so crazy it might work' things.&&>  Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo Prop and flies to Trash Island 

You'd be hard pressed to find a more Wes Anderson sentence than this...&&Hades three headed dog Cerberus' name in English means spot&&I disagree about the name... it just lends and extra layer of the bond the kid and dog had. Bodyguard dog or not it still the kids puppy-best friend.

Like a Doberman called Nibbles.. you know there is more to it.&&The name ""Cerberus"", belonging to the 3-headed demon guardian hound of Hades, roughly translates to ""Spot.""&&Am I the only one who thinks Atari Kobayashi is a little too on-the-nose? I mean, I get it, but we don’t need another Luke Skywalker. &&Well I guess less actual twats that the real Isle of Dogs.&&He’s a bodyguard, so he “spots” trouble. &&Atari sets off alone on a scooty puff junior you say?&&Millwall, Millwall, you're all really dreadful, and your girlfriends are unfulfilled and alienated&&The unofficial sequel to Green Street Hooligans. &&That cast blows my fucking mind every time I see it man &&What...no Owen Wilson?&&Needs more Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson.&&I’m so happy that Wes has started using F. Murray Abraham. Amadeus is my favorite movie of all time and he’s a huge part of why that is, but he’s been criminally underutilized for most of his career. I really hope this collaboration keeps going.&&I couldn’t find Bill Murray for a second and I got scared.&&You forgot Yoko Ono from that starring list. &&with compositions very blatantly inspired by Kurosawa&&Thank you for compiling this info :)&&Looking forward to the quirky stop-motion animation on this one.&&Somehow I imagine Tilda Swinton will be the only dog not CGI,she would actually act it.&&I would've guessed Samuel L Jackson too because of that dog in the top left quarter.&&1 Japanese voice actor when the entire thing is based in Japan...?&&RIP Professional voice actors.&&Here’s the [animation department](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/fullcredits/animation_department?ref_=m_ttfc_18) for those wondering who creates the on-screen performances.&&Huh, I hadn't thought about that. Sneaky sneaky Wes Anderson.&&FUCK&&No, that’s the sequel. &&Isle of View (I love you) was the original iteration of this, I think.&&The Isle of Dogs is an actual district in London, I'm guessing someone involved in the creation of this film had heard of it at some point and thought it was a good name. &&Mind = blown&&Why not.  We already have cat isles and rabbit isle in Japan. 

[I visited the rabbit isle in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIE_JZ6726I&t=2s), it was as fuzzy and furry as you can imagine. &&I used to live on the actual Isle of Dogs in London, and people used to make that joke all the time!

""Where do you live?""
""Isle of Dogs""
""I love dogs too, but where do you live? HA!""
""...""&&To me, the Isle of Dogs is a place in London...&&When I heard the title I thought it was gonna be the Lord of the flies, but with dogs. This is good too.&&Holy shit.&&I wonder if the original concept sprouted from the wordplay in the name.&&That would actually be awesome!&&I’m curious about the robo-dog&&His filmography plays like a greatest hits list.&&Don’t forget Grand Budapest hotel!&&Man, I'm going to sound like such a bummer since he's amazing and I love everything he's done he's literally my favorite filmmaker *but* I really really dislike stop motion animation. I've tried watching all of the best but I just can't like them, they look creepy as hell to me and I've always disliked them as a kid. I kinda forced myself to watch Fantastic Mr. Fox, which was still enjoyable, being a Wes Anderson movie, but I really couldn't get into the whole stop motion thing. I'd enjoy it tons more if it were an animated movie or something. Like 2d or 3d, doesn't matter. So I really wanna be excited for this new movie since it's Wes Anderson and the cast is amazing but... I really can't enjoy stop motion animation :(&&Quirky.

That's it.

That's the best way to describe Wes Anderson movies.

It's also why *I cannot fucking stomach them.*&&But there is no Shiba among all the dogs? Wierd.&&This. Now everyone is going to think that is the character for ""Dogs"" when it actually says Isle. And vice versa.&&Chinese speaking people also feel your pain.&&Haha that’s the first thing I noticed too since I can read Japanese. I don’t know why they superimposed the English words over the opposite kanji symbols but it’s really killing my buzz &&Wouldn't it be because it is written the opposite way of english? &&I'm right there with you dude. I wish they had just left the kanji text alone, and used の instead of a ケ, then put the English translation at the bottom. That would have looked more clean and wouldn't have folks thinking they know some Kanji when this poster lied to them. &&This has been hurting me inside since the very first time I saw the trailer for it. It's irrational and I know it, but it fills me with rage.&&First thing I saw&&Is like those random tattoos, characters are more of an exotic touch not bother to be studied. 

Very annoying and superficial poster design that could have been easily done in a better way. sadly a very common issue and not new to wes Anderson. I can think of the portrayal of india or europe and whatnot.  

Is not clear if he is this superficial or if he is just using this as an intentional style to idk maybe show the romanticized and orientalistic views of a certain usa social class. My guess is that he doesn’t care much for content as long as it fits in his aesthetics.&&The first thing I noticed. This cannot be unseen and will burden me for the rest of my life ;-;

Or maybe just until I go to sleep.&&My brain was too busy figuring out how it would be pronounced (いぬがしま？） to notice, but now that you said it I will never unsee it and kind of hate you a little bit. &&Dog Island would make perfect sense.&&/u/johnboone16 is your guy.

I always notice he posts textless versions of posters.&&If you're not familiar yet: www.moviemania.io&&spooky doggos&&Uh, yeah.  Is this intentionally creepy AF?
&&Literally not one cute dog in this poster. &&You should see the trailer.... It's worse:

https://youtu.be/fx1-RXrKKBk&&Wes Craven's *Isle of Dogs*.&&I'm flattered.&&Wes ...[Boreland](http://assets.teamrock.com/image/c6c4e0c4-3247-4d61-839b-79fc9a2facc7?w=800)&&Rushmore&&I've only seen three up to now (Life Aquatic, Grand Budapest, and Moonrise Kingdom) and although I loved all three I would say Grand Budapest takes the best of title so far. Any advice on which ones to watch next? Definitely watching Fantastic Mr Fox before this new one. &&Fantastic Mr Fox, followed closely by Bottle Rocket and Rushmore &&Moonrise Kingdom. To me, it's an absolutely perfect movie. &&Life aquatic&&[The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders](https://vimeo.com/129804479)&&Fantastic Mr. Fox followed closely by Moonrise Kingdom. When I first saw Fox I thought Wes Anderson had found his medium, stop motion just lends itself so beautifully to both the story and Wes's auteur sensibilities. Moonrise is just magic, it's everything you want in a Wes Anderson movie about childhood. I also grew up, as a teen with no understanding of film criticism and directors' visual styles, loving The Royal Tenenbaums, so that one will always have a special place too.

I'm super excited about Isle of Dogs.&&The Darjeeling Limited.&&Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox are a tie for me... I love Roald Dahl who wrote Fantastic Mr. Fox so that one is very close to my heart. Grand Budapest was so good, it’s up there as well. It’s really hard for me to pick a favorite. I love all of his films in different ways. I have them all on dvd. I’m really excited for another stop-motion though! This will be a good one. &&The Royal Tenenbaums.&&Grand Budapest hotel, followed by The Royal Tenenbaums&&Grand Budapest Hotel&&Rushmore and Bottle Rocket&&Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic have gotten the most views in my life so they must be my favorites. I didn't like Life Aquatic the first time I saw it, so I'm glad everything worked out.

I also like...all of the other ones. I don't know. Don't sleep on Bottle Rocket. In fact, if you don't like the others, try Bottle Rocket. It's a little less quirky and stylized because it's his first.&&The Life Aquatic is easily my favorite, which is surprising to some. To me it’s also one of the funniest comedies I know.&&Moonrise and Rushmore depending on the day of the week&&The one I saw last.

But ultimately probably Grand Budapest. &&I'm surprised I haven't seen more people mention Rushmore! Although it's before Wes Anderson really established his own unique style it still is in my opinion some of his best work. &&Pulp Fiction.&&Not a Wes Anderson movie but the church scene from Kingsman.&&Life Aquatic is one of my favorite movies of all time. The Royal Tenenbaums is also great, followed closely by Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.

The others... I just find them to be *okay.* In Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest, there are too many characters, too many big star cameos, it's distracting. If you enjoy movies where there are 20 big names, you'll enjoy his later work. IMO, crafting weird and eccentric characters is his specialty, so the less characters the better. His new titles rely heavily on the star power of his cast and less on the story and character development so I don't like them much at all.&&Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Grand Budapest, roughly in that order but they're all great.

Rushmore will always have a special place to me because I remember seeing it for the first time and thinking that I had never seen another movie quite like it.&&Fantastic Mr. Fox

&&Grand Budapest &&Maybe this is his response to the dog killing comment. “Wes Anderson kills all the dogs in his movies.” Wes: “no! I love dogs! [Isle of Dogs]”&&That needs to be a movie!&&Yeah that was kind of /r/mildlyinfuriating material for me. I wish the kanji lined up better or they just put the english elsewhere. &&I don’t understand what the ク is for between dog and island is for. I know very little Japanese, took it over 10 years ago, so sorry if that’s a dumb question. &&Yep, Gmork.  And the robot one is jimmy neutron’s pup!&&The art style didn't bother me much when I watched the trailer but this poster, I don't like looking at it.&&I like that it exists because it's a bit different and that is always a good thing for cinema. But, I agree with you that it is really creepy and it makes it just a bit too uncomfortable for me to watch. 

It's like the voices and the puppets don't quite sync up in my head and I can't block out that weird feeling it causes. The best way I can describe the feeling is that it is like I'm watching some sort of acid trip play out around me while nobody is acknowledging my presence. Really creepy, but again, glad that different movies are being made.&&It’s because he uses real animal hair / fur. It’s not common for animation because it shows a lot of the animator’s hands’ movement and just overall looks weird. Which is why Anderson likes them. It’s polarizing for sure&&I'm roughly 100% sure it's intentional.&&I actually really like these. As I did in FMF. Which is weird because I usually really easily get the creeps for puppets.&&Most of them are fine imo, but why do two of them (center-left and top-right) have those detailed human eyes? For some reason the first thing i thought when i noticed them was that they are some sort of demons hiding among dogs waiting to suck away your soul with their dead eyes.&&The animation kind of creeps me out. I've seen a bit of Fantastic Mr. Fox, and it's just so off-putting I don't know that I could ever watch the full movie. I have heard it's great, but idk, the animation is a bit much for me.&&Agreed. All the top comments are just gushing over Wes Anderson movies but this poster looks creepy and the plot sounds mediocre.&&You guys are exagerrating, lol. I have 0 problem looking at those dogs. The art style looks fine.&&It's Wes Anderson. He'll get a pass. They're ""quirky"". &&Two. Ken Watanabe and Scarlett Johansson.&&Aren't most of the characters just dogs? I think all the humans are played by Japanese actors.&&From the trailer almost all of the human characters were Japanese and speaking Japanese, while the dogs were speaking English. &&[deleted]&&Call me crazy, but I get this idea that the Japanese dub might have Japanese voice actors.&&Do those dogs have Japanese ethnicity?&&Marvel movies come out like once a week. Just the other day I was thinking, ""Gee, I hope Wes Anderson comes out with a movie soon.""&&I have zero interest in any Marvel films but always get dragged along to each new one and end up loving it. But then I'm not excited for the next one that comes out. I never saw Winter Solider or Iron Man 2 or 3 but got taken to see Civil War with six friends who were all so excited to see it. I just went along, and at the end of the movie we were all talking about it. None of them liked it. I adored the fucking thing, and I didn't even wanna see it. &&A BoJack comment on a Wes Anderson post. What is this... a  C R O S S O V E R   E P I S O D E ?&&Why is that awesome? &&As a fellow bassett enthusiast, i am inclined to join in your outrage at this travesty.  Also, username checks out.&&You can describe most of great media across genre in equally reductive short two step or three step arcs.  Heck, it's impressive you had to use 5 steps to simplify the Wes arc.  

[Here is Kurt Vonnegut describing the shape of stories in 4 minutes](https://youtu.be/oP3c1h8v2ZQ).   One of my favorite videos ever.   

He covers four types of story, at about 1 per 30 seconds, plus pauses and jokes.  Your description of how simplistic Wes Anderson is actually sounds much more complex than Kurt's simplistic description of Shakespeare and even more modern authors.   

Which is to say, I'm not convinced that ""I can give an insanely simplistic three bullet point description of a specific artist's main body of work"" should be seen as a reason to dislike them or really dislike anything.  

---  
Edit: here is an extra insanely too long example of what I mean:

I love Massive Attack's multi-decade discography even though they have made a couple hundred songs that are as simple as 
*A combine lush strings with vibrant acoustic rhythms 
* B flatten the tail melody of the chorus, so that you can seamlessly loop back into the verse without building to a hook/peak 
* C meticulously re-edit using the best computer software available but without pitch-correction or anything that will make it sound robotic.   

I could also say MA makes formulaic lackluster music for people to get naked to (and dance to on drugs) but never fall in love with or break new ground.... and that would be sorta true too. But it would miss how incredible or important or good Massive Attack is.  

If you can describe something simply it means you didn't understand it, shame on you.  OR, you are understanding something fundamental and simple about it, and expressing it in a beautifully succinct way.... congrats!    OR, it was simple and (maybe also) boring to start with.     

Ragging on art by describing its ""simple"" components conflates the last of those three with the others.   It's usually a rhetorical trick of trolls and also just hipsters who like to feel superior to others by hating on universally beloved pop culture experiences with freshman-101 quality anthropology critiques.   

---

Sorry if this was an absurdly niche analogy, but In drunk and listening to Massive attack right now.  &&Failed patriarchs also feature prominently in his films. I relate to his movies generally as a question of masculinity and responsibility. I would say they are themes/tropes more than formulas though, the settings and story arcs are very different in all of his films. I could see how someone might be tired of it after a few of them but I'm not that someone.  

Then again I'm not bothered by repetition if it's done well. I love the Bond series, for instance. &&He's kind of like the Tim Burton of the 2000s.  His films started off different and compelling and visually brilliant, but after a while you realize he can only really do that one thing.

I dunno.  I have a lot of friends who were prime Wes Anderson targets back in the mid-2000s and they all still get excited about his films.  I gave up after Fantastic Mr Fox because it was clear I was watching the same film over and over again. 
 Maybe there's something about them that I'm missing.&&I don't mind the formula in Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, Bottle Rocket. The whole package is so good, there are only a few extremely quirky characters that I get swept away by, etc. The newer films rely heavily on star power and have SO MANY cameos that there is little to no character development. So if you watch Life Aquatic vs. Grand Budapest, you can see that the formula is super obvious and overdone in recent films.&&[deleted]&&God damn this is the most accurate comment here. &&I've never understood why people like Wes Anderson movies. They've always seemed so stilted and artificial and effortfully weird. &&[Here is your Deep Dream picture](https://i.imgur.com/PJp2Idm.jpg) Processed using the randomly selected imageset: mixed4a using layers (57 - 362)

This is a place name (similar to 青木ヶ原) 

In Japanese, the function of の changes to が in a relative clause, which is often changed to ヶ yet is still pronounced が... &&犬の島 sounds too straightforward and childish imo, 犬ヶ島 just feels better

Omg guys, it’s like, “why even bother if you can’t do something more original next time?”&&Totally agree with failed patriarchs. I also think you're right to consider it a trope rather than a formula. 

Also, you're definitely right: his movies do center heavily around masculinity. We tend to see the failed patriarch who may or may not also be the character with unwarranted confidence. However, I feel
like the only purpose the female characters serve is to propel the male story, whether that's to act as a love interest, question the failed patriarch, serve as the voice of reason while the male gets into all kinds of shenanigans, etc. It would be interesting to see a female with some false confidence instead and see how that affects the story. I don't know... as I get older, his movies rub me the wrong way as they seem sexist and heavy on the male story. &&Failed patriarchs are a huge part of Spielbergs's work as well, due to his personal relationship with his father. I have to wonder what Anderson's background is.&&Hipsters gonna hipster&&Good bot&&I don't think I am. &&Fun fact „shreiber“ comes from the German word „Schreiber“ which means „Writer“. &&His voice is legendary.

To be fair, I've only seen three movies by Wes Anderson.

So while the Japanese read 犬岛 as ""shima inu"", in Mandarin Chinese it's ""quan dao"".

Sort of like how ""kindergarten"" is both a English and German word.

As a chinese-speaker, it's pretty fun for me to get the gist of things that have Japanese on it, when there's kanji sprinkled over entire lines of words from the other Japanese alphabets.&&https://i.imgur.com/0UjJ7o2.gif&&I understand something but not everything. English and Japanese is not my primary language so... Can you explain a bit further. What do you mean by relative clause?

I was scouring the thread hoping this would come up.&&Holy crap, 鬼ヶ島 is like that too. Learned something new today.

I've seen both の and が used interchangeably for relative clauses and always just assumed they were exact equivalents. Does that not apply to location names?

Trying to better understand why の would be incorrect&&Ah, thank you very much
&&How is this a relative clause though? Could you explain further? &&Bingo. Even more examples: Kasumigaseki, Sekigahara, Fujimigaoka.

Not sure why? Objectively in my mind it's his greatest, more realized film, but it also ranks low on my personal list (though I still love it XD). Maybe because the themes are more mature in some senses? Or because it's less focused (which says a lot for a Wes Anderson film)? He still was growing into his style at the time. 

All in all, it seems people who saw it first like it more and those who watch his later stuff and go back like it less. I honestly have no idea why.&&Bottle Rocket doesn’t really hold up but you can tell he was still developing his style. &&I watched this with my brothers, it's such a good movie. The scenes in the village where no one speaks English are absolutely stellar.&&I miss Rita so much. &&I swear everyones favourite Wes Anderson film is the first one they see&&That is the only movie I watched for the first time and immediately rewatched it. I used to watch it whenever I was feeling really depressed and it always made me feel better. It's one of my all time favorite movies.

I come from a big dysfunctional family so Royal Tennabaums clicks with me. But really each of his movies are special to me in their own way.&&Same here.  There's just something about it that makes it really heartwarming even though it's a fairly sad movie. &&Also when Mordecai flies to Hey Jude... Sigh. &&I said in an earlier comment, this is my personal favorite, but I think it ranks so low for many people because there is no epic adventure or exotic setting involved.&&The best part&&Get your hands off my lobby boy!&&Definitely my favorite Wes Anderson film.&&I thought の means of, and using katakana between two kanji also makes no sense. Especially when it says Dog Island and not Dog Of Island?&&*ヶ, not ケ ^^;)&&Your point about the sort of intrinsic misogyny in how he uses female characters is very true and something I hadn't really considered. It seems like he does a great job creating mysterious and memorable female characters, but then, as you said, only really uses them to advance the male protagonist's plot. It is a shame because I get the sense that he could tell a great story around many/most of his female characters but then...just doesn't.  

I know my wife loves his films, so I just asked what she loves about them and she named: the scenery and the casting. I wonder if those are the more appealing elements to most of his female viewership? &&sounds like a plan&&I don’t understand what the point of saying that you don’t like him other than to get a reaction.&&Fun fact, 'fact' comes from the Latin word 'factum' which means, ""an event, occurrence, deed, or achievement"".&&Just out of curiosity, what's up with the quotes written like „this“?

Also, as usual, the soundtrack is out of this world. &&Whaaaaaat? Fite me irl&&> Darjeeling Limited was subpar for him, but still good

Darjeeling limited is his best movie, or at least tied with Life Aquatic.

(Or... everyone likes different Wes Anderson stuff).&&It didn't review as well, but I always find myself going back to Moonrise Kingdom and Darjeeling Limited.

edit: i mean Darjeeling didnt review well.&&I've noticed that a lot of people either place *The Darjeeling Limited* as their favorite and *The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou* as their least favorite, or vice versa. Personally, I think *Bottle Rocket* is my favorite with *The Darjeeling Limited* as my least favorite, but that's the thing: none of his movies are any less than fantastic, some are just more fantastic than others.&&[deleted]&&It's actually reversed in Japanese, inu-shima. There's actually one more character in there that makes it a complete phrase in Japanese though (犬ヶ岛).&&[Linguistics.](https://images.dailykos.com/images/401915/story_image/History-Channel-Alien-Guy.jpg?1495036346)&&Out of curiosity...is this gif of the same actor who plays ""Townsend"" in Washington's Spies?&&From the perspective of modern Japanese just think of it as a hold-over of an older version of the language that you would more often see in names of things and places.&&Fun fact, there is actually an Inujima in the Setouchi islands. No の.

That movie always puts me in a great mood for some reason. I watch it when I am feeling down or out of sorts and it always cheers me up. &&I could see how if you started with his later films RT would not sustain your interest since there is no epic adventure or exotic setting involved. 


What does it for me is Gene Hackman though, I've never seen anybody play such a lovable asshole the way Gene Hackman plays Royal.&&Not me. Saw Royal Tenenbaums first. Didn't like it. Not sure why. But Fantastic Mr. Fox was the second of his films I saw and not only is it one of my favorite Wes Anderson films, but it's one of my favorite films period. &&First one I saw was Grand Budapest, had to change it to Moonrise Kingdom after my second reviewing of it. Grand Budapest is still a close second. I honestly adore all of them (except Rushmore, which I can only go as far as to say I love it).&&You sound like someone I would be friends with. Yeah, the scene where the helicopter crashes is so fucking sad. Always makes me tear up. And the end. Fuck I love that film. 

“It’s an adventure.”&&It’s archaic. You see ヶ (read ga) in place names.

Ga is the archaic “no”.&&From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ke)
> When used as a conjunction, 〜が〜 -ga-, it has the same meaning as 〜の〜 -no- (which is more common in modern Japanese), and is **commonly used in place names**, though rare in everyday words.&&[Here you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ke), surprised me as well. Fun facts for Japanese learners.

>When used as a conjunction, 〜が〜 -ga-, it has the same meaning as 〜の〜 -no- (which is more common in modern Japanese), and is commonly used in place names, though rare in everyday words. One relatively common word using ヶ is 雁ヶ音 karigane (kari-ga-ne – goose-'s-sound, the cry of the wild goose).&&The music is always great too! 

Plus, even if his films are mostly-male driven, they are still charming and engaging to watch. It's just disheartening when the female perspective is absent,
over and over again.&&Probably similar phenomenon to the Manic Pixie. Mysterious female only insofar as she’s something with which the male protagonist can interact interestingly.&&Fun Fact: The word Fun can be found in the word dysfunctional.&&[Some languages use different styles for quoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table)&&I feel like the quotations are doing the ""walk like an Egyptian"" dance.&&That's how quotes are in German, looks like u/endoplasmatisch knows his shit.&&No problem :D 

I only found it after a bit of googling actually. I had no idea his narration was that extensive or fantastic. &&It's from within the last couple of months I think. The violence is so brutal, too! :D&&Oh, it's definitely on the list! I've just been saving it for when I have a chunk of prime bingeing time - probably next week during that post-holiday time when you just lie around like an exhausted, overstuffed potato after the family has finally left.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq9drEYDmOU&&This made me think he died. I had to look it up.&&He would've made the best dog&&And all of them are beautiful.&&Rushmore, Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and Darjeeling Limited too! &&ESTEBAN WAS EATEN&&The crickets and the rust-beetles scuttled among the nettles of the sage thicket. ""Vámonos, amigos,"" he whispered, and threw the busted leather flintcraw over the loose weave of the saddlecock. And they rode on in the friscalating dusklight.

&&Kinks....god&&I like you&&Life Aquatic is probably my favorite, but Grand Budapest is like the most visually appealing movie ever made. Idk, I like all of them, and saw Darjeeling last in a Wes binge so it's likely that I'd just been too in touch with the formula when I saw it.

 Excited for Isle of Dogs, I keep trying to make my kids watch Fantastic Mr. Fox but I think the animation is off-putting to kids. &&Life Aquatic is my favorite and Im *really* wanting to see Darjeeling Limited (but its harder to find online)&&The real answer is they're both his worst movies.&&Whaaaaaaaaaaat? Fite me irl!&&the ケ confuses me though. Like is it the katakana ケ, or some kanji I’m unaware of. Because it just reads as Inu ke Jima to me. I’m no sure what the ke means. Shouldn’t it be 犬の島？&&Well also, in Japanese it’s 島, not the simplified Chinese version. That Chinese one is so cool though, I haven’t seen it before! &&Was his hair always that poofy? That's not how I remember it... 

hmmm....

Knew exactly what picture it was. &&No he's from a video game website.. www.videogames.com&&For me the narration at the beginning was so much. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood at the time. I'm going to try it again for sure cause I love Grand buddha pest and fantastic mr. Fox.  &&That movie has a lot of depth. Ive seen it probably 20 times or more but it's been a while, so time for a rewatch.&&[deleted]&&But this is the internet the only language we use here is american.&&From the last week of October. 

There's less violence than I expected, but when it's there, it's brutal. &&Once I get caught up on my hero academia I'll have to start that.&&Oh god yeah, definitely save it for when you’ve got a bunch of time. I binged that and Ash vs Evil Dead while laid of in bed sick as a dog. Had to rewatch both since I’d intermittently pass out and miss stuff, but I enjoyed the Punisher immensely. I’m hoping they continue it, would love to see where it goes. &&[Ya'll should check this one out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvERJ7CSD8I)&&[Now do it backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC1yKxISBOo)...&&Where did Obi Wan go in that scene?

Excuse me I have to go.&&Give this person some gold&&The first time I saw Life Aquatic I was really disappointed. But every time I've rewatched it I've liked it more and more. It's a strange movie for me in that way.  &&It looks like a katakana ケ, but it’s actually a kanji read as が in this context. I don’t know enough about Japanese to explain why, but grammatically it functions the same way as の in this.

All the potential plots just seem a little small since we sorta have all the major beats in his life written. Whether it's a Clone Wars side story, Kid Kenobi, or Adventures of a Desert Hobo... the scope is pretty limited by Star Wars scale. 

Like with the last one how do I get an enemy above 'petty thug' level given that aside from Jabba's goons you're on the planet farthest from the bright center of the universe? 

And how do I make it like movie scale good not mildly diverting EU novel scale good? &&My money is on Rey being OW's grandkid and this movie will show Obi-Wan meeting Rey's grandma. &&Choose life. Choose a job. Choose secretly watching over the force-sensitive son of your former pupil in a godforsaken corner of the Galaxy. Choose going to Tashi Station to pick up some power converters.&&Leave Jesus out of this&&His presence will make or break this movie. If for any reason he isn't a part of it- I probably won't have much interest...&&The problem with this is an Old Obi wan story isn't that interesting. Its him on tattoine looking after Luke for 20 years....

A young Kenobi movie has way more potential &&Exactly, no need for save this planet/galaxy shit. 
The only issue I seeing is making the stakes believable, the plot will have to be loosely rated to the original trilogy but at the same time tel l a new story that we don't know the ending too (protecting luke, fighting vader, etc...)&&Agreed. A Fistful of Dollars in space. There's your perfect Obi-Wan movie. It doesn't need to get any more complicated than that.&&>end of Logan

>low-stakes

Just kidding though, I totally agree&&People keep calling Logan a ""low stakes character drama"" or something to that affect, but the plot revolves around Logan's last attempts at saving the mutant race, by escorting the kids across the border. 

Just because it focuses more on character depth than explosions, doesn't make it low stakes. &&Considering that Stephen Daldry was the rumored director, I have a feeling that this is what they're going for.&&I want ewan to hunt a vengeful darth maul in the sands of tattooine for 3 hours as there's flashbacks to the clone wars (animated series) &&They kinda have to, what with how he can't leave the planet and everything... My bet is on bringing in Maul, unless that was dealt with in Rebels (I'm about a season behind and planning a binge before TLJ, so pls don't spoil).&&Ewan or we boycott. &&I just hope whatever they do, they take their time.

Quality over quantity...&&If the movie is set between rots and a new hope, then you might get your wish, since obiwan didn't really do much high stakes galaxy saving during that time. He's more grounded and dealing with internal issues.&&That wizard is just a crazy old man. &&I beg your pardon sir, but do you know what he's talking about?&&that wizard is just a crazy old man&&[deleted]&&The guy who mistakenly built a bridge over that one river?&&A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one &&While this one has been on the most wanted list of Star Wars fans for forever, I fear that the might over flood the market with SW content just to keep up with all the superhero movies and that might be the wrong choice for a franchise like SW.&&With one movie release a year, it's essentially never stop. You got to wonder if some of the crew who been at it since awaken are not going to burn out eventually. &&This is the only way I can support this movie&&No Ewan, no watch. &&Ewan went into studio to record his voice for the Rey flashback in The Force Awakens, so he has worked with Disney already.  There is hope...&&If they don't bring back Ewan it better be because they've resurrected Sir Alec Guinness.&&##**BringBackUncleOwen**&&Yes please, he really wants to return

I love [the scene where he fights General Grievous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXTFdDrd7pA), you can clearly tell that he's having fun and enjoys it

EDIT: In fact, he even makes lightsabre noises when he's filming the fight scenes &&They literally can’t do it without him, and they’d be fools to try &&Theres no other way to do this movie. #bringbackewan&&He's now the perfect age to play a slightly aged Obi-Wan &&I honestly don't think they would have decided to do the movie at all unless Ewan was onboard. He's said multiple times he wants to do it, he lent his voice to TFA, and it's common knowledge the fandom thinks he was the best part of the prequels. It just makes no sense to recast. &&If it's anyone but Ewan, the movie won't work at all.

I'm pretty sure they realise that. It'd be like making a prequel to X-men about wolverine, but it's not Hugh Jackman... &&I have hope because they brought him back to do a line in Force Awakens. They also put that one tall chick in the white robe from a deleted scene in Revenge of the Sith in Rogue One&&I think they, no matter what, are going to keep the Clones trilogy 100% canon, and that in their minds deciding to reprise the character for an Obi wan film that it would be Ewan no matter what. It’s not like trying to do a young solo film, because Harrison Ford is just much much older now. They want to bring his character in, and it’s Ewan’s character 100%.&&But you *will* watch it.&&/r/madlads&&Rest assured, I will be on the internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.&&General kenobi &&I want Lucasfilm to arrange a press announcement for this movie. Kathleen Kennedy and others sat at a panel of desks and microphones, reporters and cameras everywhere. Out walks Ewan from the screen behind them, the whole room goes wild with cheers and applause while Ewan grins and waves 

He sits, composes himself. Takes a sip of water. The room is quiet.

""Hello there!""&&>EWAN

More like OB**EWAN**, can I get an amen&&I'm only interested in Han Solo because the production of that movie makes Rogue One/TFA production look like a cakewalk. Apparently Ron Howard reshot nearly 80% of the movie and practically doubled the budget.&&I think Han Solo is a plenty interesting character even without Harrison Ford, but I really just have no interest in a prequel about him.&&> I don't mind annual SW movies as long as the quality is good.

I thought Rogue One was good but it suffered so badly from being as rushed as it was.

So many details and scenes that felt like they were lifted straight from tv-tropes to fill up the script.

But a strong cast and stuff carried the movie through, I just wish it had like another year in early development and it would've been as great as I think it should've been and deserved to be.

That worries me about the Han Solo movie, I think a prequel has a lot of potential to be great, but it is also something that can fall flat on its face without the proper care.&&Josh Trank was apparently working on that one before he got fired.&&BOBA FETT??&&Boba Fett - David Fincher expressed interest so long ago that it could have been the first of the anthology films out the gate. The problem is, he is a a fan favorite but the general public remembers him as the over-hyped bad guy who got comically wasted in ROTJ. &&I want to see a Lobot film &&Kit Fisto &&Think about it...
Rogue ONE
Han SOLO
Obi-WAN 

It only makes sense that the next one is...
Slave ONE&&I always just assumed that was Lars not wanting Luke to get involved in the Intergalactic conflict, he feared that Ben would tell Luke the truth about who he was which would put him in danger. &&It's probably because Obi-Wan trained Anakin who died. They probably blame Obi-Wan for Anakin's ""death"". So we could have a scene in the movie about that, with Owen lashing out on Obi-Wan who can only be sorry and sad.&&IIRC they hated him because, from their perspective, he was a crazy cult member that got their stepbrother killed. They knew if Luke were to start talking with him, he would find out about the Jedi, which they did not want to happen. &&I think his uncle was just trying to protect him. &&To be fair, from Lars' perspective, Anakin is a guy who shows up, gets all pissed that farmers didn't rescue his mom from sandpeople, then goes off to murder a bunch of said sandpeople, brings home a corpse, and goes off about how he wasn't strong enough to save her but someday he'll be invincible and all-powerful and will be able to stop people from dying, yadda yadda. And then a few years later, Obi-Wan comes by and is like, ""Hey, do you mind raising his kid, because I think I killed his dad after he went all crazy fascist."" So it's understandable if Owen doesn't have the highest opinion of Jedi in general.&&Obi wan is taking a shit&&*record scratch* You’re probably wondering how I got here.&&Don't try it!&&Hello There, a Star Wars Story&&The Max Rebo band's take on a Stevie Wonder classic. &&With Tommy Wiseau in charge&&Lucas reveals what the prequels should have been with Darth Binks&&Dew it.&&Oh man, a true Tattooine western. Ewan McGregor as Ben Kenobi as a Clint Eastwood style character that rolls into town, kills all the baddies, breaks the heroines' heart, and rides off into the twin sunset. &&The comics have an arc called ""The Journals of Obi Wan Kenobi"" that cover something pretty similar.

SPOILERS Below


There's a drought on Tatooine (I mean, more than usual, I guess), and the Hutts are sending out gangs to collect water from the moisture farmers. Eventually Obi Wan steps in and stops a group from taking a farmers water. Jabba sends a wookiee to find the culprit, and he finds his way to the Skywalker farm. Obi Wan fights the Wookiee, young Luke does some improbable flying shit, and then Obi Wan decides he should probably lay low, what with him being a wanted galactic fugitive.&&We can have many things in this movie. Obi-Wan learning how to become a force ghost by communicating with Qui-Gon (seeing Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon again would also be sooo amazing) and Yoda, Obi-Wan mourning the death of all the Jedi and his brother Anakin, him learning of Anakin's survival,  maybe having him do stuff in Mos Eisley and dealing with a lot of scum and villainy, maybe saving Luke from Tusken Raiders and interacting with Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru who would hate him for causing Anakin's death, and seeing him try to forget acting like a Jedi, use the Force less and deal with not helping people in need to not arouse suspicion.

Damn this movie could be amazing. As long as they have Ewan McGregor back I'll be extremely happy and hyped.&&I like that the general popular idea here is a film that all takes place on Tatooine and is smaller in scale (in some ways) compared to the other movies. Also, the idea of Obi-Wan using restraint from whipping out his lightsaber and the force. So when we get toward the end and he ignites its, you know he means business. 

Good stuff.&&I’m not an expert in the filming business, but usually the script writing stage is called pre-production with production only starting when they film it. &&I'm a production coordinator in the industry. It sounds like they'll start filming in January 2019.&&Fuck that. I want a Dexter Jetster 50s style diner spin off, possibly featuring a Becker type character.&&We need a spinoff about the guy on Bespin with the ice cream maker.&&We need a backstory for Salacious B. Crumb&&The article talks about rumors about spinoffs for Yoda, Boba Fett, Jabba the Hutt... Honestly, your idea would be so much better than any of those. &&""You will see this movie and you will like it.""

""I will see this movie and I will like it.""&&Obi Wan's diary, day 7525:  Still hiding. I'm really, really, really bored. &&Rated R&&Butt we hav siks dart vader movies alredy! 

I agree. A proper movie about Darth Vader that isn't him as a kid becoming Vader (1-3) or turning back into Anakin (4-6) showing him in his prime, detailing his relationship with Palpatine and his fight against the remaining Jedi could be excellent.&&Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe there are a bunch of cannon Comic Books that follows Vader shortly after Ep. III &&Tatooine is the perfect setting for a Yojimbo story&&I'm waiting for the moment they hire George lucas to direct one film.  Like the guy misses it and wants back in occasionally &&Dexter. His name is Dexter, and don’t forget it.&&It has ""Star Wars"" in the name, would generate $1 billion ;)&&""I've had it with these mother fucking sith, on this mother fucking plane!""&&Kamino ain't no planet I've ever heard of. Do they speak Aurebesh on Kamino? &&I actually liked that scene.

Maul knew he wasn't going to win. he was broken and significantly weaker then his first encounter with obi wan. But he had literally nothing else. His family, his people, everything he had was gone. All he had left to do was die. So he baited obi wan into a fight he knew he wasn't going to win.&&Best to leave Maul out: you would need to explain that he lived for two entire animated series, and had a significant role. It’ll leave people scratching their heads.&&Or his ~extended mission to Mandalore~ during his padawan days where he developed the hots for Duchess Satine

I’m actually screaming for help but God won’t answer&&Maybe that. Or when he was training Anakin, or getting trained by Qui-Gon.&&: a Star Wars Story.&&I would watch the absolute shit out of a small scale desert hobo adventure.

But I'd bet money that either imperials come to Tatooine for some contrived reason or he gets a message and hops on a ship. They won't make a movie that isn't 'epic'.&&Right because watching yet another Death Star in TFA was Sooooo compelling. 

Star Wars needs some smaller scope stories. The best Star Wars stories are the ones that are more intimate in scope: ESB, KOTOR 1 and 2, Thrawn,  Etc&&I honestly want a quiet character piece with minor thug villains. We don't need to huge stakes in every movie, and we all know the character can't reasonably leave the planet in canon. &&Choose sand.&&Cue to a scene of Obi-Wan running from sandpeople as he takes away their loots.&&**Last Days in the Desert** had way more Star Wars nods than I was expecting. &&Make it a spaghetti western and it will be fine.&&>A young Kenobi movie has way more potential

I disagree, a young Kenobi movie would have to be before Phantom Menace.  When there were no Sith in the open, and no great threat.  It would have to be a pretty generic movie about him facing a threat that wasn't important to the later stories.  Plus, Liam Neeson is quite a bit older than he was in the Phantom Menace, so while not impossible it would be odd for him to reprise the role of Qui-Gon Jinn.

But, with a 20 year gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope there is time for adventures for Obi Wan.  It could be that an Imperial Officer or Inquisitor discovers information about Luke and Obi-Wan has to stop him before he can take the information to the Emperor.  Or the settlement Luke is in could become the target of a crime syndicate and Obi-Wan has to fight them.  Or to tie the film into the sequels, Luke could catch the attention of someone affiliated with Snoke.  

*Edit:  Thinking about it more, I think this idea would annoy some people but depending on how he is portrayed in the Last Jedi, I would enjoy seeing Obi-Wan face off against a young Snoke.  Perhaps Obi-Wan being the source of Snoke's giant scar.  It would also be fun if it turns out Obi-Wan disfigured three of the most powerful dark side users: Maul, Vader and Snoke.*&&Then use Ewan as old kenobi and have him remember the story as flashbacks. Either way we need all the Ewan we can get&&He could go anywhere in the universe for a week or two. 

Or something interesting could come to him.&&We don't know that he sat around on tattoine the entire time.&&Really? He never stepped foot off the planet in 20 years? Even if he didn't its not like you couldnt come up with an interesting story on tatooine... concealing luke, the owens, defending local tribes, conflict with the hutts, bounty hunters, pod racing, old clones from the war, darth maul, bobba fett etc.. there's a ton of different things he could be doing that would make a compelling story.&&Obi Wan falling in love whilst in hiding, having a kid, who coincidentally had another kid who ended up on Jaku... Last Jedi reveals the link, everyone is hyped by Obi Wan films = $$$&&[deleted]&&Obi-Wan helps defend a town of vaporator farmers from mercenaries loosely affiliated with Jabba the Hutt.  At the end Jabba figures out he's a Jedi and is planning to sell him out to the fledgling Empire, but Obi-wan manages to get some dirt on Jabba that could easily be used to discredit him with the other Hutts and cause him to lose his criminal holdings and his standing, so Jabba has to agree to both keep the secret and not bother the farmers again.&&Maybe his pet mole rat goes missing on the desert planet and he starts off on a quest to rescue it .&&Low-budget, gritty, R-rated, violent Obi-Wan film incoming.&&I read on here somewhere about how it could focus on Kenobi in exile on Tatooine, quietly protecting a young Luke Skywalker from Imperial forces who are searching for Vader's rumoured offspring.

This makes it low stakes but still being very influential on the plot of the classic films. Also might give it that Logan-vibe.&&Easy. Podracing. That shit rocked. Kids would eat it up nowadays, still.&&We don’t really know to what lengths Obi Wan went to protect Luke. Could be interesting. &&I don't really see him as a ""play rival gangs against eachother for money"" type... perhaps something a little more like the ""Outlaw Josey Wales"" in space... he is already an outlaw/veteran of the losing side anyway... they could have bounty hunters out looking for surviving jedi and he has to leave or risk endangering Luke. The movie is then a game of cat & mouse ending with him adopting the name ben and the official story being that obi wan is dead.&&I think I'd prefer *Yojimbo* in space.&&whoaaa this is perfect&&Those we're high stakes. High up on his body at least.&&I probably should've clarified, high-stakes for the characters, but low stakes for the world. When the stakes are intimate and about the characters in the story, it makes it feel more personal, and I think this is the best route to go for the Obi-Wan film. Obi-Wan, like Logan is a character that is beloved by many for his portrayal and what he represents, and if they can expand on that by focusing on character conflicts it could result in a great product.&&The world wont end if the mutants die out...thats is the difference.&&Something like this has already happened in Rebels, which I believe is Canon.&&Obi Wan and Maul already confronted each other in Rebels last season.&&Now sit down and drink your blue milk &&As a kid I always heard this line as ""That wasn't just such a crazy old man.""&&All legendary wizards are crazy old men. 

Gandalf, Dumbledore, Merlin, Ben Kenobi, all of them &&*Well, hello there!*&&That wise jedi master with unfathomable powers that your father also possessed is just an old, powerless bum. Drink your milk. &&Quoting only 3 movies, really? A man of your talents?&&Yippee!&&[deleted]&&Oh I don't think so. &&Oh come on. They're milking the franchise till nothing but dust comes out. &&At the rate they are going the odds are much more likely that they will have a dud star wars movie that bombs in the next 6 to 8 years &&I thought the same thing with the MCU, but with how well-made and enjoyable they've been, I still haven't gotten tired of the genre. 

Which is kind of amazing considering how many comic book movies have come out since X-Men re-opened that door 17 years ago. Granted, most of the comic book films outside the MCU have been utter shit, but there were still good enough ones being made to make up for the horrible ones (Raimi's Spider-Man films vs. 2003 Hulk).&&Doubt it. It’s called a full time job and I’m sure they’re loving the steady work&&When the story breaks that he is returning, the post will break reddit.&&In fact if no Ewan we riot.&&Help us ObEwan. You're our only hope.&&If they try to pull a Solo and get some other random dude to play Obi, it's going to be fucking terrible.&&it will be a trilogy, first young obi wan with a wacky cgi friend, then a rowdy teen, then when he goes hermit&&No Ewan, no *viewin’.*

FTFY&&[deleted]&&They would be insane to make it without him. Im already skeptical as fuck about this Han Solo movie coming. I would really hate for an Obi Wan movie to be the first Star Wars thing I refuse to watch. I’ve even seen the Christmas Special multiple times!&&Honestly, I really don't see any reason why they wouldn't approach McGregor for this. He's great in the role, he's popular with the fans, keeping the same actors is good for continuity (and something Star Wars has always tried to do).


I know executive meddling has ruined many films over the years, but for the life of me I can't see how Disney would come to the conclusion not to stick with the same actor when everybody loves him.&&He was also in their live action beauty and the beast remake, so they've worked with him in a few things already&&A newer hope. &&lol, if Alec Guinness got resurrected to reprise his role as Obiwan, he would _not_ be pleased.&&Considering what they did with Tarkin I wouldn't be surprised to see Guinness at the end of the movie.&&An Obi-Wan and Uncle Owen buddy adventure movie with Ewan McGregor and Joel Edgarton would be super fun.&&^BringBackAuntBeru&&ewan as obiwan is my favorite part of those movies. &&*This is where the fun begins*&&god this looks so bad. the ewan's eyeline and grievous' are completely off. not his fault just bad cgi. also the close up reactions of ewan, against the greenscreen makes it seem really low budget&&Unless it takes place before the prequels. Ewan is too old for that.&&''we need to cast someone who looks a lot like McGregor so the character looks the same. But *who*...?&&And they brought back Bail Organa.&&That is Mon Mothma and she first appears in ROTJ. She says the ""many Bothans died to bring us this information"" line in ROTJ.&&You are a bold one!&&So uncivilised &&Obewan McGrobi&&Other than the accelerated production schedules and Harrison Ford breaking  his ankle the Force Awakens production was a cakewalk. There no shake ups or anybody unhappy with the what JJ was producing behind the scenes. There’s a reason they brought back JJ for Episode 9. 

But yeah rumor is Ron Howard was brought on after filming 90% of the movie and reshot 80% of that which makes Rogue One’s 40-50% look easy. At least Gareth Edwards got to stay on for that and have his name &&Where did you hear that?&&The real issue is that we already saw his arc in the OT. In addition, the mystery of how he got to where he was in ANH adds to his character. I'm sure it'll be an enjoyable movie, but it's just completely unnecessary and an obvious cash-grab because of how popular the character is. &&R*ogu*e One not R*oug*e One.

Rouge One was Luke's squadron leader's callsign in the French dub of the movie.&&**Josh Trank: The Collapse**&&WHERE?&&Fincher was offered The Force Awakens, too. During the press tour for Mindhunter, he talked about how he has no interest in making films with a committee approving every aspect, which is why he won’t make a Star Wars film.&&I know you mean Boba Fett, but it's funny because Fincher also worked on Return of the Jedi as an assistant cameraman...&&Lars was really a good dude. Sad ending for them, they were just nice people who took in a kid who technically wasn’t even related to them and it got them killed. &&I always imagined it was because he and beru couldn't have kids of their own and he was being selfish, wanting Luke to run the moisture farm when they got too old. &&You're tearing meesa apart lisa&&“I did not ruin them, it’s not true, it’s bullshit, I did not ruin them, I did NAAHT.

https://i.imgur.com/D2Da9rW.gifv&&I was not impressed by the idea of an Old Ben spin off.

However, if it was an old ben Ewan Mcgregor Scifi western with non-world ending stakes, that would be honestly be in the running for best film in the SW universe &&Obi wan Yojimbo&&Not mine, but someone made [a movie poster](https://i.imgur.com/qfZ7OPN.jpg) for it already.&&I think I was just subconsciously repeating the plot for the old cannon book named ""Kenobi"".  I don't think it applies anymore, though the story is universal. As commented above, it's Clint Eastwood in trouble in a town he's just traveling through.

Is a hero of course, regardless of the consequences. &&iirc, pre-production is when they get the actors, script, storyboards, costumes, etc. all done so they can start filming.&&I'm Dexter Jettster and this is my Diner.

I can only get so erect. &&Maybe it could have something to do with Obi-Wan trying to find other surviving Jedi?&&I'd also watch 90 minutes of Ewan wrecking previously unmentioned imperial assassins coming after him as he leads them on a chase around the galaxy to throw them off Luke's trail to Tatooine.&&My name is Obi-Wan Kenobi. I was exiled to a distant planet for five years and I've come back to Tatooine with one goal. To save my city.&&That's something that always drove me crazy about the writing was that planets were always a singular biome.  You look at Earth it has deserts, mountains, swamps, cities, forrests... but in pretty much all sci-fi planets are just one thing. You got your city planet, desert planet, and forest moon... &&Save the city is too much. Remember Breaking Bad - one of the best pieces of TV drama. They never had a ""save/destroy the planet"" or even ""save/destroy the town"" level of stakes, but it was incredibly immersive just because we care about the handful of characters on screen - about their relationships and fate.

A good piece of drama/thriller/action doesn't depend on artificially inflates stakes. It depends on good writing and good characters.&&Yeah, I'd love a ""Seven Samurai"" type of film, Obi-wan leading a few untrained rogues against Jabba's forces. Show how well he was actually hiding himself and Luke from the Empire. 

He doesn't need to destroy a planet sized weapon.  The stakes are already high, he needs to keep Luke safe, we know the stakes. Tell a story about him straddling the line between revenge and protection, between dark and light. 

Show us Obi-wan questioning his teachings, show us him mourning his friend, cursing Vader, show him fight with Yoda over his orders, show him considering walking away to go kill Vader himself. 

There's so much meat on these bones that I don't think exists on a Han Solo film. &&something similar happened in the comics&&dammit everytime a get a new wamp rat some little shit bullseyes it with his T16&&Directed by Tarantino&&“I hate flying”&&Now *THIS* is podracing!&&Yeah, we do. It's in the comics / Rebels TV show.

&&He doesn't need to do it for money. 

I could see Obi-Wan arriving on Tatooine, Jabba and a rival gang (of Dug? or Toydarian?) recognize he's a Jedi and blackmail him, threatening to deliver him to the Empire if he doesn't offer them protection. 

So he ends up playing them both against each other so he can simply finally be left alone. 

That's why he never makes contact with Luke, because he knows he's being watched and doesn't want Jabba to know. His shenanigans with the gangs and the mess he made with that could be the reason why Owen doesn't want Luke near him. &&More low stakes character pieces.  Seriously.

I'm so sick of everyone trying to save the world every god damn movie.  Die Hard was so much better when he was just trying to rescue his wife, not stop THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES from blowing up.&&Reintroducing mutants into a world that tried to exterminate them could be world-altering, though. They have solid evidence to show that Magneto was 100% right in that humans want to exterminate and abuse mutants. Logan helped unleash a group of severely traumatized children with super powers into the world who have no reason to trust humans. For all we know, other mutants could be hiding and use the exposure of this program as a way to unite the remaining mutants to take on the humans, who no longer have a benevolent mutant leader like Xavier to keep them in check.



We really don't know what's at stake here because of the lack of information, which helps keep the movie focused on the small group of characters in the film and makes the stakes seem smaller. Maybe the kids cross into Canada and live pretty normal lives in hiding? Maybe they resurrect Apocalypse and bring doom to the humans? Maybe they starve to death wandering in the wilderness? We really don't know. It's possible that nothing could change and that they're the last mutants in the world, who quietly disappear over time. But, it is also possible that Logan's actions could have severe consequences.&&The galaxy wasn't going to end if the good guys failed in any of the Star Wars movies either.

Anakin isn't even a character in the first movie, but if you watch the prequels as the story of Obi-Wan failing at raising a son because he was too busy trying to be a Jedi Knight and was given a padawan at too early an age, it's just a much more enjoyable experience.&&Dude no one realizes that Obi-Wan fucked up everyone that he fought...except Dooku but that was just so Yoda could have a fight scene&&He carried the prequels IMO. Much like how I think Harrison Ford carried the OT, not that they’re bad by any means, hell, SW is my favourite series. What I mean is his acting and charm as Han brought life to every scene he was in. Same with Ewen.&&Yeah. I hope they don't; I don't see the appeal in doing that at all. &&It'd be kind of interesting to see a movie about Obi-won and Qui-Gon protecting Duchess Satine but I would rather watch a movie about Obi-Wan wrestling over his demons about letting Anakin turn to the dark side and him trying to make up for that by protecting Luke&&I don't think there's any need for a pre-prequel story. The story of Obi-Wan - and then Ben's - escape from the ever-expanding Empire would be much more entertaining, and you could reasonably set it far enough into the future that Ewans age difference wouldn't be too out of place. &&hayden christensen&&hell yeah, that was awesome seeing his face up there&&Excellent casting, by the way, because that's a 35 year difference, but the actress and the makeup were perfect in Rogue One. Was a little sketchy in RotS (along with that laughably bad Tarkin in RotS, too, who was only identifiable as Tarkin because of the cheekbones), but still somewhat passable for her.&&Smelly boy&&Oh I don't think so&&Well Gareth Edwards was still directing during the reshoots, unlike the rumours Howard and Gilroy wasn't brought on to replace him.&&Well, TFA did go through some major rewrites when they dropped the original writer, but from what I remember it was fairly early on in the process&&Might be complete BS but:

https://screenrant.com/han-solo-ron-howard-reshoots-budget/&&CIA transmission picked up on dentures&&I'm gonna agree with Red Letter Media's prediction that all of the important moments from Han's past, meeting Chewbacca, winning the Millennium Falcon from Lando, the kessel run, pissing off Greedo, losing Jabba's cargo, will all be shoved into the same adventure.  Thus dumbing down the entire character of Han Solo.&&Exactly. There's nothing they can really do with the character development wise because the movie has to end with him being the same selfish asshole we meet in ANH. Maybe I'm wrong and they've got a brilliant story that manages that perfectly, but I highly doubt it.&&Haha, I wanna blame auto-correct but I am not sure who is to blame really. Corrected now anyway. :)&&Josh Trank is the reason I'm on this website.

I watched the Fantastic Four and it was so bad I had to check the internet to see if it was as bad as I thought it was.

Like, it was on a level where I couldn't believe it was released as a serious major studio film.

The first result on google of people talking about the film was reddit.&&Staring James Franco as Josh Trank.&&ICANSEEMUCHBETTERNOW!!&&Can't say I blame him. Fincher only works if he is unrestrained. Cutting him a check and letting him work would not work with Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy. &&Coming to TIL post near YOU! &&But Lars and Beru know Anakin. You know the line “he has has too much of his father in him.”&&oh hai Qui-Gon &&That works too perfectly...&&They could literally remake yojimbo with jedis instead of samurai and I would be more than happy.&&This is correct. Along with location scouting, scheduling, and all other logistics that need to be worked out to film. Writing is usually considered its own stage. So it goes Writing, Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. &&Remindme! 5 years&&I would be very ok with that. George isn't bad if he has someone competent who can tell him no when the need arises.

Imagine what a mind fuck it would be if George came back to direct just one of the side projects and it ends up being the best Star Wars movie since Empire. &&Yeah had mixed feelings about the fight being so quick until I saw a fan video analyzing it and pointing that out. Now when I rewatch it, it feels super cool.&&Obi wan bekillinme&&The animated shows did *everything* with Maul's arc. He barely qualified as a character based off just his TPM appearance. &&I thought he just wanted to use Ezra to get to Ben. He didn't want to get attach to another person after Sidious murdered his brother on Mandalore. That's too much pain for him. His life is a tragedy though. &&The problem is the sand &&A Fist Full of Imperial Credits. &&>The Jedi, The Sith, and The Force

I am... the crazy old wizard.&&Tatooine is ma city!&&Ewan Mcgregor is actually my fancast for Oliver Queen, he has the beard and his performance as Obi-wan is pretty close to comic book Ollie. &&Don't forget your underwater cave planet

I'm old gregg&&But aren't all the other planets in our solar system similar to that?&&Earth is pretty rare in its diversity of environments though&&Yep just like how casino royale and skyfall had the lower stakes of the four Daniel Craig bond films but they also felt the most tense because of good storytelling and direction. &&Logan or spiderman:homecoming are much better examples than breaking bad, which is in a completely different genre&&Probably destroyed the town with all that meth they flooded the streets with.&&Don't know how popular an opinion this will be, but i watch Rebels with my kids and the way they closed the Darth Maul thread was f'ing brilliant.  Superior skills still there, but compassion and the absence of hate as well.  Interesting to portray him as still a true believer who holds to the Jedi code despite everything.  I could definitely get behind a story that shows personal conflict and doubt though.&&Also get Liam Neeson to come back as a Force ghost.&&I watched this one Youtube video about how a movie or plot/narrative gains weight. And when a story centers around the ""end of the world"" it loses all weight. The heroes are obviously going to win. But when it is something much more simple, like missing a kid's recital or killing a mob boss' kid, it becomes more tangible and more possible. And when we accept a possible outcome as a real possibility we suddenly care. 

With that in mind, a story of Obi-Wan protecting baby Luke and the Lars ranch just won't be good. We know what happens. 

But a story about someone like Satine (which I love that they named her that in Star Wars, as Ewan did Moulin Rouge during the prequels and Nicole Kidman's character was named Satine) and their romance/drama would be so much more interesting as her life or death doesn't matter to the main story. It only matters to Obi-wan- so we would care much more, and the outcomes would make us engaged. 

But hey, who am I? If I knew anything I would be rich.&&> Yeah, I'd love a ""Seven Samurai"" type of film

[After seeing Clone Wars do their own version of Seven Samurai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-9OPULmrFE), I'm all for this.&&BRING BACK LIAM NEESON!!!

Obi-Wan showed respect and acknowledged that both he and Maul were victims of the Sith, and Maul expressed hope that Luke would avenge both he and his nemesis. It also showed that Obi-Wan considered Luke to be the true Chosen One.

Plus the teen Luke cameo and ending with Binary Sunset? That was some Clone Wars level goodness.&&It put Kenobi's final duel with Vader into perspective. &&My favorite star wars moment&&These are not the relatives you are looking for… &&There’s a city in the clouds where they keepin my crew...&&No dude it’s “excuse me while I kiss the sky” not “kiss this guy”&&Why does this remind me of Revolver Ocelot?&&You are a **1**&&*Your movie will make a fine addition to my collection*&&NOW THIS IS PODRACING

It was more a nod to longtime fans. He doesn't have any dialog and is only on screen for what, 5 seconds? It was 05 so they couldn't cgi him. He would also be about 20 years younger than he was in New Hope. &&What does it say about Peter Cushing that his cheekbones are so instantly identifiable?&&Oh I'm not brave enough for prequel memes.&&That’s what I’m saying, Howard’s situation makes that look normal, Edwards at least got to be a major part of the reshoots (although rumor has it Gilroy was also a major part) and have his name on the movie. He still seems to have a good relationship with Lucasfilm. Lord and Miller not so much although they did handle it gracefully. &&That was part of the accelerated process actually, Michael Ardnt wasn’t moving quick enough to feasibly meet the December 2015 date in time so they parted ways but he wrote enough to be credited in the final film. 

But the actual production went off fairly smoothly with the only major setback being Ford’s injury and even then it allowed for them to write more development for some of the characters in the off time &&That's the thing too; we don't need to see all these events that already have happened.  They happened, that's all we need to know.  It'll just be like Rogue One all over again.

The Obi-Wan movie could work since we don't know exactly what he did there.  We know he dropped off Luke and kept an eye on him.  That's it.  There's at *least* one good story to tell there.  Leia knew of him and thought him alive so something big happened.&&At the end of the day though Solo is just a dude with giant nuts.  Taking risks no one else would take.  That's what makes him interesting enough to warrant a movie about those adventures.  I'll see it because Star Wars, bit I'm not hyped on it by any means.&&Maybe showing the events that led Han to being a selfish asshole at the time of ANH?&&> Like, it was on a level where I couldn't believe it was released as a serious major studio film.

Fittingly, that's exactly how the internet reacted to the 2005 Fantastic Four film, too. I cannot believe they greenlit a sequel to that shit-fest.&&SE Scum&&Yep, they met Anakin at Anakin's absolute lowest, and it was at their farm where he loudly admitted to slaughtering all the Sand People. Not only is there a chance one of them heard that, but it's not like Obi-Wan just dropped Luke off without any explanation, so they, at the very least, got an abridged version of what happened to Anakin. Plus, in that time between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, the name Darth Vader had to have become well known, even as far away as Tatooine. So, they not only knew Vader before his transition, they likely had a very strong grasp on just how dangerous he was, and how bad things would turn out if he found out his child survived, so after seeing RotS, I couldn't really blame Lars for wanting Luke to stick around.&&Howin yousa sexin life?&&Writing is usually referred to as ""development,"" but otherwise, yes.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5uO2UzVGp4#t=3m0s

Why am I upvoting this?&&Don't curse Star Wars with that name&&No. Not here too!&&The other planets aren't livable so if you are already changing things. It's convenience not relalism that lead leads to simple system planets. Which is fine for most part but it would be more interesting if some had more diversity.&&Casino Royale will always be in my heart as the only amazing James Bond movie. They're all fun, but not amazing. And its most tense moment is a game of poker! No sky laser beams required.&&No, I like that too. He's the ultimate Jedi, but I think that makes his conflict worthwhile. We'd be seeing the one time he really struggled with the Order and see how he redeemed himself and rededicated himself. 

I think there's merit in both, because the Obi-wan you see in New Hope is so steadfast in his beliefs that he's willing to let himself be curious down to bide them some time. But I also think there's a more interesting tale going on inside the mind of a man who watched his Order burn and was left with a lonely isolated exile. &&Not sure if you saw all the small details or not, but he initially goes into his ""classic"" Obi-Wan stance with his saber over his head, but then changes to the same stance Qui-gons used. Maul goes for the same face smash move he used on Qui-gon and that's when he killed him. It all came full circle. It was beautiful. &&I'm pretty sure the Maul v. Obi Wan fight in Rebels is considered one of the highlights, up there with the Ashoka v. Vader fight.&&Agree, & the old samurai sword off was really nice touch. Great way for Maul to go. 
Side note, if y'all haven't read Kenobi, it's decent. Not quite 7 samurai but it involves moisture farmers, tuskan raiders, & saving a small family. &&Right? How good would it be if Obi-wan is struggling with Yoda's orders, to stop fighting and just *hide*. 

And in his struggles, he sees his old master, who convinces him to find a way to do his duty to the Jedi, but not to give up. This helps Obi-wan to solve whatever problem he's facing, but not as a Jedi, so that he doesn't blow his cover. 

This way Obi-wan, instead of just killing all the gang members and succumbing to the dark side, he is convinced to ""Seven Samurai"" the gang. He trains people, he fights back as he did when he was a general. 

At the end, Qui-gon returns to tell him he's proud of him, Obi-wan doesn't feel it that way, but he agrees to follow the Order still. 

There's so goddamn much they could do. &&That's why I don't think you make the movie about him protecting Luke, you make it about Obi-wan on Tatooine. In that case, we only know he survives to A New Hope. 

We don't know his beliefs, we don't know how he lived his life, we don't know anything about how he affected Tatooine, we don't know who he knew/loved/lost there. 

I think there's still story to tell. &&THIS PARTY'S OVER, MUTHAFUCKA!&&WHAT DOES MASTER YODA LOOK LIKE?

One of the best performances in my opinion and Mads Mikkelsen  pulled it so very well. &&I think that it would be really cool to see Obi-wan go through the exact same questioning of both the Jedi and his teachings that Anakin did, only to instead come out on the other side as the wise, compassionate man that we see both in ANH and that one episode of Rebels.&&Second time.

Not in the dogmatic sense of the jedi, but in a spiritual appreciation for the majesty of a universe he's only now starting to appreciate since he's lost everything.

...Dang, I just realized that since jedi tried to live aesthetically and without materialism, and Obi Wan is basically the ideal Jedi by the end, Anakin was probably the most important and painful thing he could lose.&&I really hope the Obi Wan solo movie is slower, more of an internal struggle and closer to some of the samurai movies of old. I mean it'll probably be another action-adventure space flick, but one can hope, right?&&This is outrageous, it's unfair. How can you have played Obi Wan already and not be immediately decided to reprise the role?&&Abra's psychic powers come from its high midichlorian count?&&Gesundheit.&&From my point of view the prequels are evil&&I really wish Anakin had been introduced at an older age. Like 13-15. That way 19(?) year old Padme wouldn't have been as creepy (teenage boy having crush on older teenage girl is pretty normal and relatable rather than prepubescent boy) and it would've made sense for him to be kind of angsty. The whole immaculate conception and midiclorians should have been scrapped too.  &&Tbh I really liked Anakin after Order 66 and I think Hayden did a really great job. But the rest of it isn't really all that great. I personally still liked the Prequels but I definitely see that it has its flaws. Ewan did a great job trough all the movies and it would be wrong if he didn't atleast get an offer to play the role again.&&What about Jar Jar though?

But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. &&Well, I didn't mean to spell it like that, but looking at it now I kind of agree with stupid me. I think the refusal of stuff like love or passion was harmful to the jedi, and it was only there so they could act or look like they were above or unaffected by the universe they claimed to protect. It was all an aesthetic, and we see through Obi-wan and Satine, Luke, Qui-gon, and even Windu that jedi are at their best and sometimes most understanding when they have a love for the world and things they're protecting.&&*Hello There intensifies*&&Yeah!

ENDLESS TRASH!&&The Movie&&The references are fun though and nobody in Hollywood could get away with using them like Spielberg.&&Stuff in the Oasis still costs money.  It is still a have vs havenot society.  In the book, Wade has little to no Oasis experience outside of school because he cannot afford to go places in the game.  He also isn't the only one driving a Delorean, but the author did not take a lot of time to describe every other vehicle we could potentially see on screen.  Plus, we may be seeing a few ""chosen one"" tropes going on.&&By the time of the events in the film, ""80's mania"" had died down considerably, since no progress had been made on the quest after several years.

**Light spoiler**

They have to make him go from fairly average, to gaining a lot of weight, to somewhat buff. It's just easier if they have him start as normal as he looks here, and then have a segment when he lets himself go. 

I mean he's an actor, therefore already too attractive to play this role accurately without a ton of extra production work that isn't at all vital to the story. &&But remember he got super buff in the book because it was so important to the story and not just masturbatory nerd fantasy

His name carries so much weight that any other director would have meant half this shit wouldn't have made it in. 

Side note though I'm so hype for a Gundam on the big screen. &&It feels even more impressive than Roger Rabbit must have been.&&Yes and no.

It's a movie targeted for geekdom, chock full of relevant product placement.

If you look at it it from that perspective, the things that stand out the most are things that are still relevant today. Tracer, Chun Li, the Gundam towards the end in two pretty lengthy shots for the trailer.

Everything that is still relevant and sold today, whether it's part of a game or a line of products is basically paying for itself. The movie probably has an advertisement deal with all those companies. The non-modern stuff is relegated to the background. Did you notice FemShep next to and slightly behind Tracer?

&&The 80s still hold up even after 10 years since it's premiere.&&The early parts of the book are terrible.

I've not kept up with the news.&&The DeLorean factory was about 5 minutes drive from my house.  The old banked test track is still there and I got to drive it earlier this year which was cool.&&But why male models?&&which annoyed me. It's not the deepest book but one aspect of Ready Player One that was interesting was how people portray themselves online vs real life. 

[Art3mis was notable in the book because the author made sure to note that the only thing she had changed about herself was her birthmark. That was a big part of her character...that her birthmark was the cause of her low selfesteem and her discomfort in revealing herself to others.](#spoiler)&&It's been a while since I read it, but isn't she supposed to be [overweight and black?](#spoiler)

Edit: Thinking of Aech. Thanks guys. I need to reread this damn book. So good.&&I was confused to see Wade interacting with her, seemingly frequently, in real life.  A major theme of the book is Wade's, and society at large, social isolation in the real world. He only physically interacts with people at the beginning of the book and the end.&&I've gotta admit, I'm annoyed that they didn't cast a curvier actress for Art3mis.&&The character of Artemis was a dumb niceguy™ fantasy anyway. Beautiful girl with minor facial birthmark so that the average socially incapable guy can feel superior enough to date her.

I'm lazy but someone else surely has bookmarked that poem by Ernest Cline where he explains his perfect woman, it's cringy as fuck. I'm a huge fan of the book, but it's portrayal of Artemis as a woman is borderline unfilmable.&&It's I understand that reference: The Book.&&The premise is pretty great though. It looks like they're massively rewriting parts of the story and that's a good sign. It's great material for someone like Spielberg to elevate.

For example, Jaws is a shitty book and Gone Girl is an above average beach book, but the films are 10/10s.&&Thank god I scrolled down far enough to find my people. Jesus it was a tough book to get through&&That basically describes the entire book too.&&IT BROKE BEW GROUND!!&&REMEMBER THE EIGHTIEEEEESSSS!???!!!??&&The Breakfast Club running a revolution.

Classic.&&Cmon if you were a multi trillionaire you would wanna leave behind a video like that.&&Unfortunately that's the very reason the plot kicks off. The book is fun but has some annoying tropes and Family Guy-ish reference humor.&&I'm actually really okay with this. Thinking back to the book, most of the actual challenges boiled down to either playing arcade games or miming old movies, neither of which would translate well to the screen.&&Banners at the race say ""Copper Key"" so it is clearly linked somehow. TBH a race is way more interesting than acting out an entire 80s movie like happens a few times in the book.&&I mean, one of the biggest things people are relating to is The Iron Giant&&Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is another book with dystopian world and virtual reality but a better story line.  Check it out if you haven't already.&&Yeah, I've read it a few times now and couldn't agree more.  OASIS as a concept, the fun pop culture references, and some of the puzzle solving is really entertaining but, man, are the characters and story some middle school grade, cringe worthy stuff.  Good popcorn read, will definitely catch this movie.&&Then read Snowcrash next.&&or 10's references. I saw Tracer in there.

But I assume that's just paying out the nose to everyone who ever created any IP ever made in the 1980's.  Ever.

The movie is a gigantic cash-out for anyone who made anything for a full decade (more, from the looks of it).

that's not a 'bad thing'.  Nostalgia is fun, and that's okay.

I'm hoping LEGO can do the same thing and we'll have the proper avengers VS Justice League movie we deserve&&In the book, various players have actually ported entire ""classic"" video games and movies into various worlds. Off the top of my head, there was definitely a Warcraft, Star Wars, and Bladerunner ""worlds"" off the top of my head.&&Yeah, but not everyone in the Oasis was, and you can be anything, so it's largely irrelevant, as long as Tracer isn't a part of his game to control the Oasis.&&Don't forget Lara Croft on the left.&&Chun Legs*&&If I recall, this is the role that Spielberg wanted Gene Wilder to come out of retirement for before his death... would have been fitting.&&I kind of pictured an older looking Tony Stark.

I can see someone making fun of him having a DeLorean because it's like a starter car for people in that world &&I'd get KITT from Knight Rider.&&I think some of those wouldn't work as a car. Voltron, for example, is a giant mecha in the book. there's still some semblance of practicality to the of things.  For my land car, I would probably use Speed Racer's car. For my mech, Unit 02. For my space ship, I'd probably pick one of the real life ones. For my base of operations, clearly a death star. &&Yes, I could have been a literary giant like George R.R. Martin, J.R.R.

Jurassic Park wasn't exactly the Great American Novel or anything. Spielberg is out to tell engaging stories, and he does it well.

This is not going to be a serious movie in the way that people *want* it to be, if that makes sense. This is going to be a Jaws or a JP kind of Spielberg film. It's going to be fun, but done extremely well.&&There's literally a part where everyone claps for the protagonist after he flexes his pop culture knowledge at some ""poser""&&That's not true, there's also a lot of lists.&&*Rich Evans' laughter in the background*&& Dear Leaders of our Dystopic society, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole lifetime in poverty for whatever it is that we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. 

But what we found out is that each one of us is a messiah. And a loveable rogue. And a comic relief. A cheerleader. And a traitor to the cause who ultimately sacrifices himself in order to save the cause and plotline.

Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.&&Even if I wasn't a trillionaire I'd love to leave a video like that.  Video wills are awesome.&&It would be kinda funny if the first act of the film ends with them just playing the entirety of WarGames with Tye Sheridan poorly green-screened in as Broderick's character.  &&There's a lot of stuff in the book that won't translate well to screen so I'm okay with them making a bunch of changes, especially with the challenges that he has to do for the keys which in my opinion were the weakest parts of the story&&They mention Iron Giant as one of the mech choices in the book, so since the movie is being produced by Dreamworks, Wades probably going to  conveniently make the Iron Giant as his choice mech. Also because no one will recognize the Japanese spider man mech that he chooses in the book.

Edit: from other comments it actually looks like Iron man is replacing Ultraman and the Gundam mech is replacing The Supaidaman mech &&And much better writing also&&Just curious, if you found it to be so poorly contrived and cringey, with so many good books out there, why would you read it more than once, let alone more than *twice*?   
  
I really enjoyed it for what it was, but let's be honest here, it's basically Twilight for nerds.&&> the fun pop culture references

They're not so much references as they are lists that go on for a fucking quarter page.  

""I strapped on my sword from the Legend of Zelda (the original NES version), then climbed on top of my Speeder Bike from Return of the Jedi (1983) and blasted off down the street to the OCP building from Robocop. Inside I found a room that was filled with comics, video games, action figures and movie posters. I will now list those, too.""&&If you enjoy the world, but not the plot, I'd definitely suggest Snow Crash!&&The book as a whole is a really cool concept but reads like it was written by a 12-year-old.&&Well, the movie is set in 2045, and while the Oasis has a strong 80's pop culture vibe due to its creator, there's no reason it would be completely exclusive to other stuff. &&Lieutenant Wade, ice cream.

&&I bet Christian Bale could have lost the 10-15 years needed to fit the role no problem.&&I'm afraid if Christian Bale puts himself through that sort of thing again he won't survive it&&Four Fantastic Limbs&&As far as I know, yeah.

Well there were a lot of things in the book that didn't translate well as book, that are gonna translate well in a movie, so it even out I say.

I mean things like all the references - they had to be explained in the book, in the movie they can just sit there and it's gonna feel way more rewarding to see it and recognize it than to read: ""And at is side were Tracer, from the popular game Overwatch""&&It's not a bad alternative.

"'No Country For Old Men's Anton Chigurh is still an iconic movie villain, 10 years later",44008,7inpwk,http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/10/no-country-for-old-men-10-years-anton-chigurh/,2166,1512837317.0,,"I'd say one of the things that made Anton Chigurh so frightening apart from Javier Bardem's brilliant acting, was the use of silence during the movie. There's only one musical track during the whole thing. Rest consist of foot steps, engine hums, rustling of clothes, wind etc. It made every encounter much more suspenseful since the music wasn't there to give anything away. I keep wondering why I don't see more of that in films.&&If the rule you followed brought you to this, what good is the rule? &&the image of Bardem’s character face as he is killing the officer in the floor at the start of the film is haunting. &&The gas station coin toss scene is perfect in its simplicity and suspense. My favorite of the movie. &&What's the most you've ever lost in a coin toss? &&That hairstyle is unforgettable.&&My coworker didnt believe me recently that this dude is not a large man. They do such a great job of making him seem imposing. &&Anton Chigurh is one of the best written characters of all time. Obviously most credit should go to Cormac McCarthy for creating him, but Javier Bardem and the Coen Brothers did an absolutely incredible job bringing him to the screen. &&The teacher for my creative writing class in high school was so excited for this movie that he convinced the school to approve a ""field trip"" to the movie theatre for our whole class.  Absolutely masterful movie.&&Holy fuck, that movie is 10 years old. WTF&&I believe 75% of his scariness came from that fucking haircut. Like holy shit, if you’re willing to rock that thing, you don’t give two shits.&&Has anybody claimed otherwise? The use of the word ”still” is weird.&&Am I the only one who sings Stelios Contos every time I see him about to kill someone on screen?&&This level of brilliance in a character makes me ambivalent to my own writing:

“Holy shit, that’s good. That’s my inspiration for the day, let’s get writing!”

Followed by:

“How the fuck do you write a character that well?”&&Probably one of the most intimidating villians I've ever seen in a movie&&A WHOLE 10 YEARS!!!!!!&&I literally watched this film again last night for the thousandth time, he is utterly terrifying. Not just by what he does himself, but by how people react to him and talk about him.

Woody Harrelsons character is so cocky and self-sure, but when put face to face with Chigurh you can feel the sheer panic emanating from him. 

Brilliant film &&Bardem won the frigging Oscar for this role, did they think Chigurh was gonna be forgotten??  As far as I’m concerned, Anton Chigurh’s spot among the all-time greatest villains ever put on screen is firmly cemented (along with Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter, Ledger’s Joker Cathy Bates in Misery (Annie something), Nurse Ratched, and Darth Vader).  And keep in mind that all of those roles garnered academy awards except for Vader, which was basically a voice performance.&&The fact that he was badly injured in the end and didn't get off scott free karma wise is what made it believable for me. Still a badass, still scary, but still human and vulnerable.&&Lol, sugar?&&My favourite McCarthy book for sure. That character was ice cold and Bardem did a hell of a job portraying him on screen. 

On a side note I got him tattooed on my inner thigh and now he stares me down when I jerk off. No regrets. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/bj8NA&&*What’s the most you ever lost in a coin toss?* is one of the most chilling lines of all time, IMO.&&I loved his character so much. I know this is borderline r/iamverysmart but the way he was written, as driven only by his own set of arbitrary rules, made me take a deep dive into the philosophy of morality. To this day, my favorite villain. &&My favorite movie of all time. So perfect. &&Why would he stop being an iconic movie villain?&&No shit, 10 years isn't that long.

""Heath Ledgers Joker portrayal still holds up as pretty dang good!""&&I feel like I'm looking at an Onion article in the making here.

Breaking news: Timeless movie somehow still timeless a few years later. Local man Jeffrey Avers (32) fondly recalls the movie on its tenth anniversary: ""Oh yeah, totally! I remember that movie! I loved it when he did the coin toss, it was really suspenseful. Great movie all around.""&&One of the best, most interesting antagonists ever in film..what a performance&&No country for old men is like Shawshank Redemption or Back to the Future to me. If I’m scrolling through TV and it’s on, I will watch it every single time.&&I just remembered I saw this in the theatre with my Dad. Pretty sure it was one of the first, if not the first, that we saw after we repaired our relationship.

I lost my Dad back in August. Thanks OP for posting it and bringing back the memory.&&Well yeah Louise just dressed up as him this year for Halloween on Bob’s Burgers &&One of the best movie villians ever. The way he carried the ambiance of evil in every scene he was in, the body language, the way he spoke his words were full of terror. I would rather have followed the movie from his perspective than Brolin's (he was also great), so intriguing and you never got a resolution to why the way he was. He just was that tool of fate that sometimes exists in the world. &&Books older than that, and hes a scary mother fucker friendo &&Agreed, was always too scared to watch this movie as a young kid because of him &&Rightly so, an absolutely amazing performance. &&We need a live action Judge Holden.&&“Is he dangerous?”

“Compared to wHat? The Bubonic Plague?”&&I believe No Country is, critically speaking, the best film in existence. &&[deleted]&&Not only iconic, but perhaps the most realistically psychopathic movie villain put to film: [https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/most-and-least-realistic-movie-psychopaths-ever](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/most-and-least-realistic-movie-psychopaths-ever)&&where’d ya get that, gun, Llewelyn?
at the gettin place. &&I refuse to believe No Country For Old Men is 10 years old&&My favorite moment was in the gas station scene where the clerk is making small talk with him, and he briefly chokes on one of the peanuts he's eating out of bewilderment after learning the guy married into it.

Simple but hilarious.&&The problem is that the movie was made to be timeless. Very little reference to time, little reference to pop culture, intelligently paced to maintain impact in each scene, very little unnecessary dialogue.  

Also, since then, our villains have been Marvel characters or big action flops where the focus is on the hero. 

No country focused on multiple characters as they interacted with each other, one cop following in Anton’s wake of destruction and a man running desperately ahead of it as Anton hunts him down.  The whole movie and story is built around him. No character development, no story arch, no friendship bonding, just the steady methodical momentum of an unstable man.

I wish someone with the power to do so could see why this worked so well and recreate it in some sort of noir or sci-fi film &&“I should watch that some day.” - Me for the past 10 years. &&Saw it for the first time this summer and hated myself for not watching it sooner. What a great movie.&&Love this movie so much.  It does so well at capturing what the American West is all about.  The expansiveness, the desolation, the loneliness.  I've driven all over the West and camped out of the back of my Toyota.  You drive through parts of Wyoming, Montana, Utah or Northern Nevada by yourself and sleep in the middle of nowhere and you get some of the feelings in this movie.  Also, the intro with Tommy Lee talking about the ""old timers"" as they show scenes of open landscapes is just so fucking good..   It just gets better with every watch.   &&My Fav. Bardem movie !!&&The scene where Llewellyin waits for him in his room with his gun aimed at the door is a very good example. No tense violin to make the suspense go up, just complete silence and sometimes the sounds of the lightbulbs he is turning off in the hallway. &&I took a post-production class in college and we listened to the background of when he's choking out the cop in the beginning. I never noticed on prior viewings, but there's a train hitting its brakes throughout that whole scene and it really intensifies that moment. Excellent sound design in that movie. 

Edit: [link](https://youtu.be/Z_9KNP9I6YA) for the lazy&&Yes! I did a paper on this for a film class and focused on the sound design in scenes such as Chigurh searching Llewellyn's trailer (long scene with no dialog, no music, just diegetic sound as he explores the trailer, drinks milk).&&I think the gas station scene where Bardem makes the man call the coin for his life is a great example of this.&&I totally agree. The scene in Zodiac where he stabs the couple during their picnic was bone-chilling for this same reason. No dramatic music leading up to it. Makes you focus more on the terror that you’re seeing.&&My favorite tense moment early on is when Llewellyn has the dog swimming after him and he has to climb out of the water and dry the bullet as it gets closer and closer. I imagine the temptation to use music there would have gotten a lesser director. &&it takes a lot of balls as a director to let silence speak for itself&&Another movie that uses silence for suspense very well is Magnolia. There is suspenseful music running through EVERY scene right up to the climax. But when the climax arrives, all the music stops and its just natural sound. It's a complete inversion of what you would expect and it's brilliantly effective. &&it was great in mother! without a score.

&&This is one of the things I love about The Wire. As far as I can remember the only music is part of the location, so when the location was the projects, you would hear boomboxes being played, usually somewhere in the distance.

It can really ground a film/TV show in reality.&&I can't remember exactly but I want to say that was the same for In The Bedroom.  I remember a lack of score and it made you really feel the actors emotions&&Because a lot of films are generally shit at creating tension themselves, so they rely on music &&Yes. I wish more movies would do this. Thing is, I think it really only works in very good films.&&The Cohen brothers are fantastic directors!&&The importance of sound is really overlooked. I love the movie Voices with Ryan Reynolds, simply because it's a horror movie/ dark comedy, that uses sounds to trigger emotions&&Do you have any idea how crazy you are?&&Amazing movie,and one of the best books I've ever read&&https://i.imgur.com/YQNbwjW.gifv&&Wells eyed the distance between them. Senseless. Maybe twenty years ago. Probably not even then. Do what you have to do, he said. 


Chigurh sat slouched casually in the chair, his chin resting against his knuckles. Watching Wells.


Watching his last thoughts. He'd seen it all before. So had Wells. 


It started before that, he said. I didnt realize it at the time. When I went down on the border I stopped in a cafe in this town and there were some men in there drinking beer and one of them kept looking back at me. I didnt pay any attention to him. I ordered my dinner and ate. But when I walked up to the counter to pay the check I had to go past them and they were all grinning and he said something that was hard to ignore. Do you know what I did? 


Yeah. I know what you did. 


I ignored him. I paid my bill and I had started to push through the door when he said the same thing again. I turned and looked at him. I was just standing there picking my teeth with a toothpick and I gave him a little gesture with my head. For him to come outside. If he would like to. And then I went out. And I waited in the parking lot. And he and his friends came out and I killed him in the parking lot and then I got into my car. They were all gathered around him. They didnt know what had happened. They didnt know that he was dead. One of them said that I had put a sleeper hold on him and then the others all said that. They were trying to get him to sit up. They were slapping him and trying to get him to sit up. An hour later I was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy outside of Sonora Texas and I let him take me into town in handcuffs. I'm not sure why I did this but I think I wanted to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will. Because I believe that one can. That such a thing is possible. But it was a foolish thing to do. A vain thing to do. Do you understand? 


Do I understand? 


Yes. 


Do you have any notion of how goddamned crazy you are? 


The nature of this conversation? 


The nature of you.
&&“You have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?”&&*of what use was the rule

Which it is &&What I really like is the stubborness of some characters like the gas station clerk in the coin toss scene. ""I won't call, you haven't said what we're bettin' on."" 

And the trailer park attendant woman who gives no shits to give Chigur any information.

He's such a stone cold killer yet the people he came across that were the most defiant he left alone. I think that's one of the awesome thins about this movie is they didn't follow the status quo. As fucked up as the villain was, he didn't kill just anyone. At times he was completely random in who he killed and that really made for some suspense.&&Tommy Lee Jone’s monologue at the beginning and end is amazing as well. Also when he talks to his uncle.

How big is he?&&Tom Hardy's the same way. In Bronson and The Dark Knight Rises he's shot like this massive badass. In Inception he's just some guy.

This has side effects. Christopher Judge (Teal'c from Stargate SG-1) was in The Dark Knight Rises, but doesn't appear in the theatrical cut. They cut him because he made Bane look small. &&Really? I didnt know it was mccarthys stuff. Have you read blood meridian? There is a giant albino in the book that is fucking scary.. Its probably the most fear ive ever felt while reading anything&&For real. He reminded me of a real life Terminator. No feeling, no remorse, and absolutely will not stop...ever.. until you are dead. This is the kinda dude you don't want to cross.&&You're absolutely right; Cormac McCarthy deserves most of the credit but the Coens ability to adapt it so perfectly into a film is what makes them elite filmmakers.

That opening monologue by Tommy Lee Jones is one of my all time favorites. It's so well spoken and cut to all the beautiful shots of barren and hard country. Perfect set up for the film. 

And right when you think they can't possibly fit one more brilliant performance into a film Barry Corbin shows up and kills his scene too. 
&&McCarthy has a gift for writing the best villains. Between Judge Holden and Anton he just knows how to reach to the blackest parts of humanity and craft brilliant characters from them. &&The only way people could get the crap scared out of them more by a film adaptation of a McCarthy novel is if somebody did blood meridian.  The scalphunters with their gear made from human leather, the Apache  torcher stuff.  Who would you want to play ""the judge"" or ""the kid""?  &&I had the same reaction.

The patron in Cities of the Plains is captivating.  The grandmother in all the pretty horses.  Billy.  The judge.  The list goes on and on.

In Cities of the Plain there is a story told about a boy getting in a fist fight with his dad.  The dad whoops his ass over and over again, but his son just keeps getting up and coming back for more.  In the end both father and son and everyone watching the fight are weeping and the dad just walks away....

We'd never expect Chigurh(sp?) to get randomly hurt by a nobody after he is painted as a near-invincible supervillain the entire movie. &&which was part of the point of the book&&[deleted]&&Is the tattoo facing you, or away from you? &&Rule 34 in effect&&Why?

Whole article is just clickbait to capitalize on the fact the character is well loved.&&""The xenomorph in alien is still scary guys""&&I hadn't seen it until recently. I watched the new Pirates movie and Bardem stole every scene he was in. He has a fantastic screen presence and that prompted me to watch No Country. I was not disappointed at all. He was a scarier villain than most horror villains. &&Yes. Yes. Yes. God, I wish the Coen brothers would make this movie. It’s fun to go back and read Blood Meridian and try to imagine it on the screen. It might work better as an HBO miniseries.

EDIT: Coen&&It's cool that everybody says that. And he even mentions that to Llewyllns wife at the end. He has that presence, and people know what he is there to do. The horror to know that your life is about to end but there's nothing you can do.&&We've had good villains since No Country for Old Men came out.

Probably one of the best scenes I've ever seen &&Exactly! I can't remember the first film where I noticed how effective this type of sound design is, but No Country nailed it. Ever since I've been able to identify the technique, I've been unable to listen to your standard Hollywood ""get nervous, excited, scared, or all of the above"" music and sound cues without wincing or at least being pulled out of my immersion. Don't they realize what a disservice they're doing the film? &&I think the train is just turning, not stopping. Wheels on a train will screech when they move over curved track. You can hear the train still moving at full speed as it leaves earshot. I'm not trying to be nitpicky or anything. I just know trains better than I know movies and I wanted to be part of the conversation.&&This is all great analysis but damn: the true reason he's such an effective villain is encapsulated in those final two words.&&Could I have a link to your essay? &&Diegetic 

Diegetic sound. Sound whose source is visible on the screen or whose source is implied to be present by the action of the film: voices of characters. sounds made by objects in the story. music represented as coming from instruments in the story space ( = source music)

TIL&&Off-topic, but I've noticed that only villains drink milk in movies, and weak characters order it but never drink it.&&Ah yes, especially because it puts so much emphasis on the peanuts in the scene. Not only him eating them in the most unnerving way you can imagine but the emphasis on the package unfolding after he put it on the counter. You could feel how hypnotic not only the dialogue but as well his motions where. &&See, what people miss about that scene is, Chigurh is not just threatening the man's life. He's also promising the man his future. This miserable man married into this drab existence in the middle of nowhere with no future. Now a stranger is promising the man a new future in which he narrowly escaped death and can't take any day for granted. That's why he doesn't want him to mix the quarter in with the others. As a reminder of the day he was given the rest of his life. Only Chigurh himself is not the decider. He is only the vehicle by which the quarter traveled through time and space to decide this man""s fate. There is no judgment there, no moral reckoning, and not even fate, only dumb chance, and Chigurh is merely its acolyte.&&> Magnolia

Another film effectively using no music score to convey sheer terror would be Bone Tomahawk.  I implore everyone to watch that film.&&Firearm nit pick. He's not drying the bullet. The cartridge is relatively water proof for a short duration like that. He is methodically clearing the chamber on the pistol. This is worth noting, because it speaks to his character. On the off chance that the barrel is obstructed by water or debris, and even when every second counts, he doesn't mindlessly pull the trigger; he racks the slide back, blows down the chamber and barrel, quickly visually inspects it, and only then chambers a round and fires. &&Good thing the Coen Bros. have 4!&&That movie was just insanely good, the way it sets up the raining scene is both completely out of nowhere yet somehow fits right in. &&Mother was freaky good. I felt all kinds of things for weeks after. &&The only times it used music were montages at the end of each season, and a brief scene in the pilot when they first introduce Avon.&&So are the Coen Brothers &&Yeah. They even got Bill Murray to do Garfield! &&You mean the nature of this conversation?&&Does the book have more of an ending than the movie?&&I'd also suggest McCarthy's Blood Meridian.

edit: He gives the look in the middle of it, not after. Still, perfect.&&The gas station clerk gave in and called it, though, and Chigurh made his point on the meaninglessness of the man's entire life that it had led up to a chance encounter and random coin toss. 

I do feel like the woman in the trailer park is an important little moment, though, in displaying the strength of an ordinary person  saying no to such a threatening force. It reminded me a bit of the kid in Blood Meridian saying ""you ain't nothing"" to the judge. To me there's a theme in McCarty that chaos may reign, but humans can refuse to surrender to it, consequences be damned, and that that's a noble aspiration. &&He had his principles...&&The scene with the trailer park woman, Chigurh didn't kill her because he heard the toilet flushing in the other room. I imagine he would've killed her but the sound of the toilet saved her life. &&>never flipping a half dollar

The Judge was an excellent villian. &&Agreed, for sure. Cormac McCarthy makes some of the most extreme villains in literature&&Still waiting for this to be adapted to the big screen. I can't see anyone but the Cohens doing it though, and I'm sure I feel that way only because of how amazing their work with No Country was. lol&&That book is insane&&I disagree with how emotionless you make him seem. He concocts all these strange rules and constantly tries to convince himself that he's acting as an agent of fate and tells himself (and the people he kills) that he's not responsible, fate is. Those seem like classic emotional coping methods to me. I also like to think that when CJ threw his rules and fate back in his face, it actually got to him, and is why he was distracted as he was driving and didn't even see the other car blowing the light until it hit him. &&What about “The Road” though? That was a pretty fucked up book/movie. 

But you’re right about Blood Meridian...that book was intense. &&Vincent D'onofrio and Tom Holland. Boom, casted.&&It's tied with There Will Be Blood as my most favorite movie of all time. Both are amazing.&&It's on netflix!&&Watched it last summer one night when I was the only one still up. Gets better every time I see it.&&GOD that movie was so good. People talk about John Wick training and that it is the peak of Keanu's career. Do yourself a favor and rewatch that movie with behind the scenes. &&Yeah.
Or like Darth Vader is STILL an iconic villain after 40 years.
&&Yeah, I don’t get the point of this article. He person who wrote it, obviously likes the character.  A good character and movie will stand the test of time. It’s not like “10 years later” is specified criteria to call someone an “iconic character”. Great movie though. Javier is great in most everything he is in. If anything, he’s iconic. &&Nope, sorry. The Godfather was iconic 10 years ago, but just didn't quite make the cut this decade &&I dunno.  I think he suffers from Avatar syndrome.  Ask you average Joe about ""Chigurh"" and you'll get a ""Who the heck is that?"" kind of response.

Brilliant character, but nowhere near the iconic level of Vader, Jason Vorhees, or any of a number of genuinely indelible characters on the collective psyche.&&*That's him* That's you! &&OH MY GOD HE'S SO GREEK&&He's gaining so much speed&&There's something really significant about a fight between father and son. The son thinks he has nothing to lose, so he's dangerous. The father knows he has everything to lose so he's indomitable. 

My dad""s dad used to be an alcoholic and would beat the shit out of my dad and my uncles and we talk about it a lot. Just what was going through his head when his son's got old enough to fight back. He created inevitable doom. His sons would get older and stronger and eventually he would get older and weaker. So when they were 12 he wasn't just fighting 12 year olds, he was fighting 13, 14, 15, etc. He had to make them too scared to realize that it was just a matter of time. 


Me and my dad still play wrestle now. I'm in my late 20s, he's in his 50s and he still gets me to tap. It's to the point where if he lifts things that are too heavy, he has to go to the doctor. He'll never lose because of what it means psychologically. 

It's just so interesting to think about what goes through a father's mind when he's in competition with his son. To his son it's just fun and games, maybe I'll finally beat ol' pop. To dad it's him gripping onto his son's respect with white knuckles. I can't lose. If he beats me now, he'll never respect me. 

Obviously that isn't what respect is, though. &&Thanks friend, I shall check these out. I’m on an inspiration bender at the moment and trying to learn from other writers as much as possible. &&So the movie is basically 30 years I've now.  That's crazy.&&Moss’ wife points out that he’s not acting as a supposed hand of fate right as she refuses to call out the coin toss before he kills her. He’s the one choosing to do this, and he’s just using chance and “fate” as an excuse.

Immediately after, he gets a dose of real random chance and fate by some guy who accidentally hits him. What a great way for his character’s story to end.&&He doesn't complain about it or feel sorry for himself either. He just picks him self up and takes care of business. Easier to pay off these kids than kill them in his wounded state.

What a cool villain.&&Coincidentally, it's also part of the point of the movie. Go figure. &&Fuckin lol&&Yes&&[deleted]&&Yeah but if you try analyze anything on Reddit you get called out. I’m kind of sick of the ianverysmart cult. Although if you are in the sub you don’t have to worry about it. &&No Country was the first time I'd seen, or even heard of, Javier Bardem.

The very next movie that I saw him in? Vicky Cristina Barcelona.

Still love him in the first, but blech, I'm glad to have pretty well purged the second from my memory.&&He's absolutely brilliant as the villain in Skyfall too. It made it my favorite Bond movie.&&I agree 100% with the HBO treatment. I think Blood Meridian would need somewhere between the realm of 8-12 hours to do it justice, especially if they wanted to make it nearly shot for shot like they did with No Country. 

I'm currently teaching BM to AP Lit class and they are all HORRIFIED of the Judge and we haven't even gotten to the pedophilia, the murder of Galenos, or Holden mocking the kid as he glides in front of his shot again and again. With proper casting, Blood Meridian would absolutely soar as an HBO Miniseries. &&All were excellent for sure, but in totally different ways.&&It took me years to realise that if you listen very closely while Llewellyn is waiting in his room, shortly before he makes the phone call you can hear Chigurh shoot the guy at the desk. 

It's very feint, and even with the lack of music you have to listen hard for it, but it's a brilliant touch.&&Wind River at the drill site is the most tense movie scene I've ever seen.&&For me it's got to be BR2049's Sea Wall scene. Shout out to Sicario's Border Crossing scene too.&&While I love NCFOM, I think that title belongs to the bar scene in Inglorious Basterds. First time watching that was so intense. &&this guy is puttin on airs with his goddamn esoteric knowledge about trains. get em! &&""Alright. Well what do we circulate?

one of the best scenes in any movie I have ever seen

[full scene on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLCL6OYbSTw)&&[deleted]&&What two words?&&For real though. I want to read a breakdown of this movie. When I first watched it, I was by myself in my apartment. Someone was murdered on a bike path behind my apartment about a month before. Killer was never found. I seriously tried to watch this movie 4 times before I actually got through it. FFS man watching this movie gave me a real fight or flight physical reaction. I've never experienced that from a movie before. &&The way he chokes when the attendant says the station is his wife's family's kills me.

""You married into it.""&&He's one of the few current actors who gets you caught up in the magic of his playing another character.&&Seemed to me the man was fine with his miserable existence and went right back to it.

You make it sound like it was a catalyst to his metamorphosis. That may have been Anton's take, but not the shop keeper. &&That and how he reacted when he found the site of the shoot out showed so much about his character. He tracked the guy with the money and then just waited. You could see how he became a hunter, even a cold blooded killer (that's kinda exagerated though) within minutes after he just looked like a nobody. 

And that's why the antagonism between those two was so great. Both are patient guys who think their moves through, but neither of them was a John Wick style character. They could've been guys you bumb into on the street. &&Seems to be a very divisive movie. I enjoyed it but don't feel I'd need to see it again for a while.&&I as well like Detective Conan.&&I mean the nature of you.&&No I mean the nature of you. &&No. The movie is essentially a shot for shot representation of the book.&&From what I can remember, the ending of the book is pretty much the same as the movie. 

Look up an interpretation/explanation if you think it’s a poor ending. It might make more sense after looking into it &&[deleted]&&That scene is changed slightly in the film. In the book, the cop's carotid artery is cut by the manacles, making a mess of the office. Whether that would have made the scene better or worse, I don't know. 

E. I haven't seen the movie in while so I will check whether this is accurate or not. 

E2. I was wrong :(&&He wanted to see if he could escape through pure willpower, because he believes such a thing is possible. 

This line (which I only paraphrased) is the clearest hint as to what the whole theme of the book is: Each of the three main characters is an example of will power. (SPOILERS!)

Lewellyn Moss thinks he can do everything through his brash, good old boy will power. He and his wife get killed because of it.

Sheriff Bell realizes that he cannot do everything, and talks much about this topic. He lets Anton go even though he knew he was in the hotel room. He got to go home to his wife and horses.

Anton Chigurh believes he can do any one thing, but not everything. At all times he is exactly focused on one goal, and nothing else around him matters. He is unaffected by other's pain, and seemingly his own. He watches TV and never changes channel. When he does something, that is all that he does. (He was between missions when he decided to get himself arrested)

Its a pretty cool examination of what it is to put your heart to something.&&And the noise of the cop's shoes scuffing up the floor...&&👹&&Its also a great reaction image.&&I had assummed that Anton didnt kill the trailer lady because he heard someone else in the bathroom about to come out&&It's not about the strength of saying no to a threatening force tho, it's about ordinary person not realizing what comes to their doorstep. The moment they realize, they all turn to scaredy pussy who beg for forgiveness, ""you don't have to do this"". Anton even said ""why do you people always say something like that"". When you don't realize something, you're just being indifferent--that's where the ""strength"" comes from.&&I see your Kennedy and raise you a Sacagawea&&[deleted]&&Which is why you put it up your money hole.&&https://media.giphy.com/media/14hrkAmtcVgYCc/giphy.gif&&It was so necessary, too. Showing that he actually follows the coin flip, that he is THAT sold out to the pointlessness of choice.

Edited to show correct timeframe.&&Still trying to figure out what he is.&&It seems unfilmable to me. But if someone could pull it off, it would be an incredible movie. &&I feel like Blood Meridian is way too violent to be adapted to the film well. &&[deleted]&&I thought that her throwing that back at him was a great way to adapt that scene.  It's a much longer conversation in the book, and one that I absolutely love, but you can't have everything in the book go into a movie.  That compromise stayed true to the theme, the story, and brought something a little new.

In case you haven't read the book, she eventually submits and calls it.  She loses.  He talks to her for some time giving a very good look into his head.  Might be my favorite part of the book.&&*spoilers* The road is bleak, one of the first scenes is the father's stand off with the cannibal for his son's life.  But something about the father's love for his son, and then the ending, make it hopeful to me.  Blood meridian is just daaaark (but so good) ;-)&&The book is about 10x worse than the movie &&My wife and I were in this book club with a bunch of people we liked and this one older guy who was just really irritating.  My wife's buddy was telling me she wished there was a magical way to have the book club, but without that one dude, she was even thinking of shutting it down for like 6 months, and then starting it up again, just so she wouldn't have to ask the guy to leave.  I was like, I got you covered.  It was my turn to pick the next book, and so I pitched blood meridian to them, I was like, the book is super dark and violent, but all these professors and literary critics say its like the most important modern American novel.  And that's how I broke up the book club...&&Kelsey Grammar could do the judge!&&D’onofrio as the Judge is the fucking dream. &&They came out in the same year, too.&&Blood is so amazing.

Every piece of that scene exists to fulfill a purpose; from the hanging belts to the crinkle of the peanut wrapper. Every detail exists to provoke a feeling in the audience and fill their thoughts with subconscious imagery. The complete lack of a soundtrack creates an atmosphere of unease and tension that builds throughout the scene. It's such an incredible performance by Javier Bardem as well. you can really feel how Chigurh exerts complete control of the situation over the storekeeper, who has no control over the situation at all; whether or not he lives or dies is entirely dependent on chance. Just a fantastic piece of storytelling.&&[Entertaining even with almost all the dialogue cut out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ6N1sXUZZU)&&Every time I watch this scene I cringe for the old man. He also does a fine jobs of conveying a hapless man who slowly realizes he is being threatened. &&My favorite quote from that movie, in a movie so packed with memorable quotes, and dialogue, came right at the end:

""I had two dreams about him after he died. I dont remember the first one all that well but it was about meetin him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night. Goin through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin. Never said nothin. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin on ahead and that he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.""&&[deleted]&&Distribution deal. &&There's been a few great analyses that have popped up on reddit, but unfortunately the search function isn't worth the paper it's printed on, so I don't know how to find em&&""If that's the way you want to put it""

""I don't have some way to put it, that's the way it is""&&I'd like to know if that was scripted or a bit of improv from Bardem... or just an actual choke and they just rolled with it. Whatever it was, it worked.&&Exactly. The reasoning is only valid from the Anton perspective. From any other perspective it is a matter of a sociopath with some grandiose delusions about himself. Anton killing or not killing is not a cosmic narrative nor heavenly coincidence, but it is his and only his choices to kill people arbitrarily with his own story forced on top of it. Not that it makes neither the scene or Anton any less intriguing though. &&One parallel between Llewellyn and Chigurh that I liked: they both say ""hold still"" very early in the movie. In the second scene, after Chigurh has escaped in a police car, he pulls an old man over and asks him to get out of the car. Once the man complies, Chigurh asks him to ""hold still please,"" then kills him. The very next scene we are introduced to Llewellyn. He's hunting on the plain. His first line in the movie is ""Hold still,"" then he fires.&&And then when we learn that he's a Nam vet, it all clicks. &&You guys all need to read the book, the movie is almost identical in pacing, much of the genius in tone is McCarthy's&&I forget where I heard the description of him, but it’s stuck with me: Llewelyn is a man who is so used to being underestimated that he has lost the capacity to realize he’s met his match.

It’s amazing to me that the Coen Brothers were a decade removed from making the movie that should have won Best Picture. One could assume that the Oscar they won ten years later would be a “makeup.” But I think that No Country is as close to a perfectly directed movie as there has ever been.

What’s amazing to me is that plausible cases could be made for basically everything that year. There Will Be Blood, Juno, Michael Clayton, and Atonement have all stuck around and maintain excellent reputations.&&It isn't mentioned in the film but Woody Harrelson's character, Carson Wells, was special forces in Vietnam.&&I love Conin's late night talkshow&&You can have the money... Anton.... *RIIINGGGGGGGGG*&&Anton, can we keep this about Rampart?&&*filthy look*&&This conversation was so much more in the book.  Chigurh reveals alot more of himself.

&&Heads or tails &&Uh, I don't know if we read the same book, but there's definitely a more conclusive ending in the novel - especially regarding what happens to Anton after he finds the money.&&Not quite but close. Llewelyn picks up a hitchhiking teenager in the book and she is also killed when Llewelyn is killed. There’s a little more closure in the book. &&The scuff marks and legs kicking are also what disturbed me the most in that scene.  The whole film is brilliant in its realistic depiction of violence it just makes it that much more scary and intense.&&Pretty sure that happens in the movie too!&&That happens in the movie too. He starts spraying blood all over the place and the floor is scuffed to hell from his shoes&&http://teachmix.com/performlit/sites/default/files/Chigurh_0.jpg&&Oh I agree, I think he was methodical enough to know not to risk that, but I still think that her flat-out shutting him down took him aback, given that everyone else either fled or pleaded with him, and reminded me of other important moments in McCarthy books. &&Exactly, his character represented a hand of fate. And fate is unpredictible and undeniable. Some people were spared, some werent. It didnt matter who they are or what they did, they would suffer whatever Chigurh decided. &&I don't understand the ""Which it is"" part&&Ass pennies. There I said it.&&Oh shit I didn't know he married Penelope Cruz. Good on him. &&Even if she wouldn’t touch him?&&I heard he had been in a really bad car accident before this. His face was swollen and bruised so they applied (too much) makeup to try and hide it.&&I'm pretty sure this was after his face got all fucked up so they were probably trying to hide that&&we should all be so lucky&&Didn’t he get into an accident and bust his face. Unless it’s another SW movie. &&IIRC, this was somewhat shortly after his accident, so he had a fair amount of scars that would have been pretty unexplainable. &&""If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of that show and smash it.""&&No he's not, they're married.&&Sometimes when you have 4 skilled barber shop singers hitting a particular harmony, it will produce a fifth distinct note. You can sit there and count four singers and five notes, its a neat phenomenon.

I like to think of the judge as the extra note produced when you have that many warmongers put in the same place. He is this kind of overtone that was created through violent men that can only steer them in one direction: More war.

He even said war waited before man and it will be here when man leaves, just like how the judge was waiting, naked, in the middle of the desert, for the men to find him. Many things he says about war applies to him directly as well.

Despite his huge hairless body, and seemingly endless strength, intelligence, and charisma, what makes him scary is that he is so convincing. Everything he says is brilliant and interesting.

Chigurh checkin his boots after leaving the house of Llewellyn's wife and the times we see Llewellyn taking off his boots were all scenes actually depicted always in a way that makes one shifting some focus onto them. 

Even though the movie puts so much emphasis on boots and the trace they make. Might be foot steps themselves or visible marks. It shows how both characters try to be undetectable through the entire movie.&&Another parallel: how they treated their injuries. After the hotel incursion, both were shot and in bad shape. Moss crosses the border and passes out on some steps, and the street band finds him and he offers them money to get him to a hospital. It highlights that even when injured, Moss is out of his depth and can’t do this alone. 

Chigurh blows up a car outside a pharmacy and goes in the pharmacy and grabs what he needs to (very skillfully) treat his own wounds. The iodine in the saline, using lidocaine for pain management, and the surgical tools in the boiling water... it demonstrates that this sort of thing is not unusual for him or he’s been in a similar situation before and knows what to do. Chigurh is clearly comfortable in doing whatever he needs to on his own and relies on no one. &&The best part of the hunting scene is a visual element I didn’t notice until like the 20th time I watched this movie. I love it, I watch it often.

As Llewellyn shoots, and he sees the animal run, a dark cloud passes across the sky.

In the movie the girl just flirts with him from the pool; in the book he takes her back to his room but rejects her advances showing her his ring. The sherrif has to tell his wife about finding them both dead in the hotel room so she thinks they were fucking around when he was killed when in reality he had faithfully rejected her advances. Typically depressing stuff that Cormac is so good at. Also, in the scene at Ellis's ranch there is a story Ed Tom tells where he talks about a time when he lost courage in the war and the guilt he still harbors that adds some insight to his character. There's other stuff I'm sure but I haven't read the book in a while. I will say that when the movie came out I made it a point to read the book first and I am really glad I did, fwiw.](#spoiler)&&I always interpreted that scene as that everyone that anton has encountered was intimated by him to some degree but she wasnt.  The fact she didnt fear took him aback and he didnt know how to react. &&I've always kind of viewed it um...something trivial can hold incredible meaning or value to a situation or person. The coin is just coin, (one of millions) but because it called it right it saved his life. Like in Castway, 'this package saved my life.' It was just package,  one of many if it was opened or pilled with others it would become just another package. Because he held onto it was something more, but can be forgotten easily. 

A bit more famous example ""Rosebud"" it was very important to Charles Foster. The last link to his childhood and something he wouldn't sale; or place any value on it. Ultimately it was cast off as junk and burned. It was just another sled...which it was. &&Its a sort of metaphor about creating meaning in life, at least thats how i see it. the quarter, like life, has no intrinsic meaning. Its just a coin. But since it saved his life, he has the opportunity to assign it meaning. To put it back in his pocket with the rest would be a waste. 

The movie has a smaller subtext of small town life and wasting the small opportunities to advance yourself and perhaps move on to some place better. The coin is another example of that. &&He was.  That's why the first thing that happens in *Empire Strikes Back* is Luke getting clawed in the face by a yeti.&&>Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that man’s hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a man’s worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one’s will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.

&&> how scary veterans can be

Coming from a country with universal military service, I always found US attitudes towards ""veterans"" to be weird, and your comment exemplifies why. &&> I think it's the only movie that actually depicts how scary veterans can be without having them going onto a rampage.

I know what you mean.  My dad is a Vietnam vet who was attached to the 5th Special Forces.  He's not scary in a nefarious sense...the man just.....*knows things* that the average man on the street doesn't.

I mean, he's 71 years old now and appears as normal as anyone else...but I heard he was not a man to be fucked with in his younger days.

Other little things I picked up on growing up that let me know dad was different....his attention to detail & his surroundings.  Just walking into the house, he could tell if something was moved, no matter how seemingly insignificant.

I remember one time when my car broke down at night and I had to call him to come get me.  When he got there he told me I should have been standing just inside the wooded area off to the side.  When I asked why he said ""Because you can see everyone, and they can't see you.""

One time I asked him if he had a gun in the house in case we ever got broken into.  He said ""No, just a baseball bat.""   When I asked him why he said ""Because I have the advantage, and a bat is silent and doesn't need to be reloaded.""&&I always assumed Chigurh was a vet as well, but his path after the war forked off into a very different path from Llewellyn. Perhaps the war is what chiseled him into a weapon of cold, unfeeling destruction. &&The military indoctrination process is meant to produce an individual in alignment with a specific doctrine, the US Army promotes Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage as their standard. The Canadian Armed Forces use Duty, Loyalty, Integrity, and Courage for theirs. Certain social norms do need to be modified during indoctrination, but the goal is to not produce trained killers, it’s more along the lines of producing someone who ultimately puts their needs and well-being below the needs and well-being of the group.

But yes, it is a fantastic movie. &&My cousin is a former Army Ranger. Very gentle, soft-spoken guy in general, but when an asshole fan at a football game started harassing our attractive female cousin and wouldn’t leave her alone, I’m told he had him on the ground and the whole group away from the area in about five seconds flat.&&""Are you jackin' wif me?""

The core of what he's saying is, fuck all those other guys I killed, they were amateurs. I'm your main guy for this job. 

The dream end is still the end because it exemplifies what Sheriff Bell has been feeling this whole time throughout the story. 

&&As others mentioned, Chirgurh returns the money and discusses working together with that person.  Sheriff Bell investigates Chigurh's disappearance after the car crash and interviews the kids, but they're unwilling to help him.  Dead end.  In addition, the conversation of chigurh and Carla Jean is expanded and gives an extremely interesting look into his mind.  Where the chigurh of the movie is inpenatrable, the one in the book is a little slightly less so, but equally scary.  I find his way of thinking to be extremely interesting and that part gives a little better understanding to what he is saying in many conversations.

What's just as important as showing what happened to Chigurh's, is that there is more of an explanation of why Bell retires.  Much of that is not actually at the end, though.  There is a portion where he talks about his service in WWII, and that he feels like a coward for not dying with his squadmates.  He also more clearly has a chance to face Chirgurh at the model after lewellyn's death, and doesn't.  You draw that together with him not dying on the force like his dad and other elements, and you it makes more of a complete picture.  While almost all of what he did is understand and maybe even right, he feels outmatched and that he is facing an evil he can't even understand.  He find himself unable to go out there and put his life on the line, even though he feels it is his duty almost to the point of feeling as though he SHOULD give his life.  So.  He retires.&&https://www.avclub.com/book-vs-film-no-country-for-old-men-1798213032&&This is my rifle.

I am talking about the term veteran as in ""has seen battle"".&&Well the difference comes from it not being compulsory. The average US citizen doesn't have a military background, so it isn't the norm. &&Having known SF trained veterans, your dad sounds like the real deal. These guys can fit in well into society (*i.e.* they don't stand out as weird or odd), but they take a hyper-vigilant approach to life, and they mitigate risks that most people would never consider.

For example, they won't stand near the edge of a subway platform. They always lock their cars. Although they could literally defeat >99% of the population in hand-to-hand combat, they are all very pro-gun and frequently have a weapon on them when in public.

These men can enjoy life, but they have a *seriousness* about them that makes me feel they've seen and done things that have really hardened them.&&This sounds bang on. My cousin in the US married a lovely guy who is now an ex ranger. Despite our political differences we can talk freely and get on really well. That’s by the by. Anyway, I’ve noticed eg he scans a room really carefully before going into it and certain other assessments of surroundings he makes. Just that sort of stuff that would make you a harder target. All in all...would not want to mess with him. &&Well, I can only speak about my own time within the armed forces and how I was trained (I am German, so it might differ). Next to creating the values you listed, even though some of them differ, one of the main things I was trained to do was to was to be able to kill/wound 1 or more targets within a few seconds after detecting them.

So while the bond between soldiers is important, it is even more important that they can do what they are needed to do and at the end of the day that involves killing.

There is usually a lag between hype, failed expectations, and disillusionment.

Matrix: $463M
Matrix 2: $742M
Matrix 3: $427M&&I think this is due to a couple of problems apart from the reception of the movie itself:

1. Disney is really wearing Star Wars thin, this is our 3rd Star Wars movie in 3 years, and we have Solo coming out in a few months for a 4th. This isn't the MCU, you can't just churn out a Star Wars movie every year for all eternity and not expect fatigue to set in. The Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy were released four years apart to get the audience amped up and excited instead of flooding the market. This is why I'm not looking forward to the announced Rian Johnson trilogy after the Sequel trilogy wraps up. Disney wants this to be MCU profitable, but it's going to backfire on them IMO.

2. They're treating the making of Star Wars like it's the MCU. They keep it simple, safe, joke filled etc. When someone watches a Star Wars movie there are check boxes that need to be filled. MCU movies don't have this because I go to them just to have fun, but with Star Wars I'm expecting something more: *Good* World-building, character arcs that make sense, etc. This is why people go see Star Wars. 


So yeah these are other issues that Disney has with Star Wars imo. I hope for their sake that they don't tarnish the brand at this point. &&Most people I know aren’t watching it more than once.  That explains the big drop.  I believe TLJ will fall short of Disney’s expectations, not just 1/2 of the fans...&&From these comments I'm getting the impression that this is a legitimately sloppy movie that a lot of people are trying to excuse and if it wasn't a Star Wars film it'd be doing much worse at the box office and with critics.&&I feel like Star Wars is getting a bit over saturated, I still like the series but with a new movie every year, animated series, video games, toy lines and constant shameless promotion by literally every Disney affiliate including ESPN, it is starting to wear on me a bit. &&And this is the same director that got the next Star Wars trilogy?&&I haven't seen it yet but the vibes I am getting through the force are....disturbing.&&So Rian johnson said ""When I was writing the movie, I was doing it while they were shooting 'The Force Awakens.' [...] It was me coming up with a story. I was writing purely from a personal reaction to the script of 'The Force Awakens' and what they were shooting.""  

The script for TLJ was one guy's *reaction to the first script*, not seeing the on screen final product, or the chemistry between the characters, or anything that actually matters when watching a movie. No, Rian Johnson chose to just write how he felt, and that's what he based the entire plot and dialogue of the 2nd movie of the extended trilogy on. No fucking wonder it has no cohesion with the first movie, his social criticisms are shoehorned in for no reason other than because he felt like it, and the characters and dialogue lacked any real substance. Goddamnit &&I'm still confused why they didn't just stay with one director for the new trilogy. I think switching directors was a bad idea and I felt some of the major story questions left over from TFA were given no real significance in TLJ because the new director either just flat out didn't like them or he didn't want his vision of the film to be influenced by someone else.&&[deleted]&&Well when Christmas eve falls on a Sunday, the Sunday numbers will bring down the overall weekend. Not saying that the drop is better, but it would be MUCH less if Christmas eve was during the week&&[deleted]&&Twice the sequel, double the fall.&&I legit hate Rose more than I hated Jar Jar Binks. I cannot believe the insane course of action she took in the last 10 minutes of the film. Just horrible writing.&&TLJ mocked nostalgia and lectures us on leaving behind the original trilogy yet Disney makes a Han Solo movie and is planning an Obi Wan movie.  Do they want us to care about nostalgia or move on?  Kathleen Kennedy is bad at her job imo.

  &&Why are people trying to come up with excuses for this massive drop? Last year christmas eve and Christmas were on a saturday and sunday respectively and [Rogue One had a smaller drop than TLJ and made almost the same amount of money on second weekend even though Rogue One had a smaller opening weekend total](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2016&wknd=52&p=.htm). It's clear that the word of mouth on this film is catching up to it and people need to look at the numbers before mindlessly dismissing it with made up thoughts.&&I was a manager at a theatre for a long time. The only day of the year we were allowed to close early was Christmas Eve, since most families decide to stay in.

For that it was a failure. There is no way to satisfy everyone but you should aim for more than half your core audience. People expect a greater effort to the details in Star Wars and they unfortunately treated it like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, not sweating the details and focusing on humor and the spectacle of it all. They made a by the books Hollywood blockbuster, not a Star Wars movie, and used the crutch of relying on the novels and comics filling in the blanks for fans. Unfortunately the blanks that weren't filled were thoroughly needed because fundamentally it made large portions of the movie virtually pointless and unnecessary, to the point of frustration to some viewers. No licensed book would really answer these in a satisfying and justifiable way. They also set up expectations and subverted them in the most boring and unclever ways possible. So there's that too. They literally made their own first movie in the new trilogy pointless. Also they made Poe and Finn (and Rose) responsible for the deaths of hundreds, nearly snuffing out what's left of the Resistance, all to learn the virtues of trust and patience, gosh darn it. They're almost unredeemable after this movie unless they all die in Ep. 9 or are punished thusly, which, let's face it, ain't going to happen. &&Purely anecdotal but the consensus among my friends is that none of us really care.

We've all seen the originals, but the prequels were ""our"" Star Wars in a way. Then The Force Awakens was A New Hope 2.0, which didn't inspire a lot of confidence in the new trilogy. 

I've been hearing all up and down how The Last Jedi plays with your expectations and really turns the Star Wars formula on its head, that it makes the paint-by-numbers feeling of TFA worth it, but I don't care enough about the formula to see it juked like that.

I didn't have a reason to give a shit about any characters.
There was no real sense of tension or danger throughout the whole movie making the ""amazing action bits"" boring.
It ended the way it began.](#spoiler)

I could go into more detail but these are the main reasons why i didn't enjoy TLJ.  

The original prequels are looking really good compared to this movie.
&&Admiral Akbar should have been the sacrificial hero. new girl had her chance in jurrasic park&&good

the prequels may have sucked but this movie felt like a personal insult&&I can't speak to any other outside factors but as for the movie itself, this makes sense to me.  I'm not a huge Star Wars fan but I like the universe and characters and this movie to me was a great experience...but not a great movie.

The big scenes, the references, the twists, the funny moments were all well and good but only really the first time.  The movie, the plot, the characters all fall apart really quickly once you start putting any real thought into it and the twists and subversions only really work for that initial viewing.  I certainly wouldn't watch it again.  So hearing it get such a drop off, I can totally understand.

Definitely a great blockbuster movie, and should be great for kids, but not really a movie with any substance or lasting power.  Which is especially sad since there was a lot of potential there.&&That's what happens when you have such a hit or miss movie&&[removed]&&Rose just crashed into the box office. Love is the only thing that matters, not ratings  or money.&&I enjoyed it while I was watching it, but thinking about it on the ride home afterwards, it just didn't add up to a satisfying film. The acting was fine for everyone, it was the story that I don't think works. Rey didn't have the normal Joseph Campbell Heroes Journey, and to me, that's as much Star Wars as lightsabers are. &&No,  this isn't the reason for the drop.

But this is one SW movie that I'm just not gonna watch again. I saw TFA two or three times with family and friends after I watched it by myself opening weekend. I imagine it's an extremely hard to rewatch movie for a lot of people (yes, there are also a lot of people on their sixth viewing).

I barely sat through TLJ, and I can't imagine doing it again. &&I watched The Force Awakens five times in theaters, there was so many questions and I was trying to soak up as much info as possible. With this movie there are no questions, nothing to think about till the next movie. Gives me no reason to keep watching it. I wonder if that has anything to do with this drop off.&&The movie almost felt like RJ had a grudge against against JJ or something. Every single plot thread Abrams set up was thrown out the window in exchange for meaningless plot twists. It seriously felt like the film was subverting expectations *purely* for the purpose of subverting expectations, without a clear vision or reason in mind. I'm all for being surprised in films, but only if they're presented in a manner that allows for a cohesive story to be told.

All this movie proved to me is that Disney is just letting each director produce whatever personal fanfic idea they've had stored in  their heads, regardless of how they fit in the overarching plot or how much it clashes with previous films&&I have a feeling this one won't be seen by many fans more then once in theaters...&&The dumbass /r/imgoingtohellforthis straight up mod tagged all top posts with it, which spoiled it immediately the morning of release. It was written very punctually so it was hard to miss. What a sad life one has to live to do that and think they're clever or edgy. 

So yeah, got it spoiled days before I saw it. 

The format was ""x dies. Y lives. Z returns. A kills B"" etc. Insert variables for characters. Very hard not to read it. Even if you accidentally read 2-4 words it was huge spoilers. Completely childish. 

Edit: I'm not subscribed to it, by the way. /r/all top post at the time&&Where the fuck are the aliens, who I assume would make up 99.99% of the Galactic population?&&The answers to your questions are nobody and yes.  It's essentially two factions warring over ideology while the New Republic is sitting back like, ""Hey, we just lost like four or ten planets or something like that to a splinter cell faction from the old Empire.  Really?  Ah.  Who gives a damn?  Space cocaine for everyone!""  &&My guess is that they appear to save the day in the third act. Remember the ghost dudes in Return of the King?&&For me the ""funny"" jokes in the first 5 minutes put me in a bad mood and every time I thought I was finally about to get immersed in the story they quickly pulled me back out with more ""funny"" jokes. &&A lot of the problems with the universe opened up in TFA don't get fixed. Stuff like sense of scale, it still being Empire VS Rebels, the lack of traditional Star Wars alien species, the lack of any context about the state of the galaxy, and other things. &&Without getting into spoilers: There's a lot of fat in this movie that needed to be trimmed and compressed. There are large stretches where I was just bored and it probably needed to be at least 30 minutes shorter. &&I thought most of the movie was boring filler, and the stuff that wasn't filler was pretty controversial and wasn't fleshed out nearly enough to justify making such large and unexpected changes to the story. A big frustration for me with this movie is that it concentrates way too much on side characters that nobody really cares *that* much about and acts very carelessly with the big characters.

The result is that you come out of the movie feeling like you just slogged through a bunch of mud thinking there was a prize at the end  but there was actually just nothing. The movie has little to no ""payoff"". It shuffles things and changes everything and then just ends. And it takes way too long to do that too.&&No spoilers obviously. This movie just drops a lot of interesting plot points/mysteries from TFA. It also manages to end on a note that makes the sequel seem like it will be boring (being vague here to avoid spoiling anything). It was like the writer discarded the previous movie and intentionally threw a curve ball for whoever writes the next one.&&They also couldn't really decide between a campy space comedy and a sci fi movie. The Disney is starting to show really hard with very few of the jokes actually landing, imo.&&[deleted]&&Some interesting scenes and visuals marred by inconsistent tech usage by in universe rules(if you care about that sort of thing. I think it opens up too many questions for the future) compared to all other cannon, plot holes, some out of place scenes that lead nowhere really, unsatisfying resolutions to things setup by TFA, and the movie going on about 30 minutes longer than it seems like it should have ended from.

I wanted to like it, I really did...but just can't say I do.&&The fuel plot was as bad as the trade negotiations from the prequels.&&...or that the 8 or so present Star Destroyers never participate in the battle... or that the Tie Fighters that can easily catch them and penetrate their shields are never deployed... or... ah, fuck it... it goes on and on.&&Because apparently hyper spacing near or into a ship destroys it and would kill all the rebels... And... Wait... Fuck.&&Well said. I think the 3rd movie will not very comparably well by their standards.&&It's similar to the damages that were did to the Star Trek reboots and DCEU movies.   The studios did not care or realize the damages until the third/fourth movies (i.e., Star Trek Beyond/Justice League) bombed at the box office.  By then, the damages done to the franchises were already irreversible.&&Matrix Reloaded was masterfully marketed, lots of crazy action sequences. But with Revolutions they flat out began with ""This one's special - there's going to be very little Matrix in it."" I was so goddamn disappointed. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea.&&> The Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy were released four years apart

Three years between movies, but I agree with your underlying point.&&>This is why I'm not looking forward to the announced Rian Johnson trilogy after the Sequel trilogy wraps up.

Kathleen Kennedy has exposed herself as incompetent if she actually goes through with this.&&You can churn out a star wars film every year and be successful. Their problem is every movie to this date has been centerd around the OT. &&> if it wasn't a Star Wars film it'd be doing much worse at the box office

That is maybe the most obvious statement in film-related comment history.&&I’ve even seen Star Wars ads on bags of chopped salads for months now. I feel like they went overboard trying to hype up moviegoers. &&I'd be fine with all the star wars, they just have to be better. So far it was quite a let down. Rogue One wasn't perfect but enjoyable, the rest I'd rather forget. &&[deleted]&&Yep.&&Just forget every question you have going into it. Because there will be no answers&&I thought Disney was doing something risky for once and killing off a character just like that. &&The “please hold the call” and “your mother” joke 5 minutes in broke my immersion. It wasn’t a good start. &&There were about 100 moments where one of the main characters faced certain death, only to dash to safety at the last second. It was laughable at the end. No danger in the entire movie. &&Yeah that’s when I checked out. I finally came to peace with her actual death in that moment until her hand twitched. &&That was some bollywood level shit&&The Friday to Friday drop is pretty big as well...&&Yeah they really got screwed over by Christmas Eve this year. 

Pretty much all theaters in my area closed around 5:00 PM yesterday so that was gonna kill their Sunday numbers no matter what.

Today might make up for it, though.&&I don't know if it is as much of a factor as you think it is otherwise Disney would not have chosen this period of time to launch the movie.&&[Slight TLJ spoilers](https://i.imgur.com/OEtSk3g.png)&&Maybe Kathleen Kennedy is purposely making the Solo standalone terrible so the past does die. It's all an elaborate ruse that just looks hypocritical before we see how atrocious Solo really is :^)&&Going to the theater on Christmas is actually a fairly common tradition. It been somewhat clouded by Star Wars the last few years making it seem driven by Star Wars, but it’s been the case for decades. &&Thank you. People seem to also be ignoring that this drop happened well before Christmas Eve. We were hearing about it on Friday, and the drop Friday to Friday was larger than Sunday to Sunday, indicating Christmas helped if anything.

People just really want to like the sequel Star Wars films for some reason, and will make any excuse they have to for them.&&I hate that I can't just tell people I didn't like the movie without having them jump down my throat and calling me an idiot.&&Yeah but the bar for Jumanji is set much much lower than for any Star Wars movie. It’s a feel-good family flick staring The Rock. A far cry away from what TLJ was supposed to be. &&Jumanji has one the the best comedic performances of the last 20 years, too. After about a half hour I was convinced I was watching a 17 year old girl in a Jack Black CGI costume.&&I really love star wars, and I never overly criticize the films, but I had much more fun watching Jumanji than I did TLJ.&&very well said, I don't mind twists and changes but you have to earn them. This film seemed like the equivalent of watching the ending(s) of Return of the King (LOTR) without watching any of the movies first. 

Sure it looks cool, and you can say ""Ha ha didn't expect that!"" but without the build up why care?&&It's the small theaters that I feel bad for...they got so royally screwed because of this and who will hurt because of it? the small cinema owners. Fuck Disney. &&Netflix’s first attempt at a blockbuster getting trashed like that is one of the most obvious examples of paid reviewers I’ve ever seen. Blatantly obvious the major studios were behind them to protect their business model from the threat of Netflix pumping out theater quality blockbusters &&true.
it's even more baffling that characters just go in and out of hyperspace across the universe during the chase &&They were so concerned about whether or not they could that they never thought to think whether they should.&&At least the prequels brought a lot of cool stuff for the EU to take advantage of. I wouldn’t dare imagine my childhood without the planets and characters that the prequels introduced for the EU to expand on; this movie...each movie has introduced like 1 planet each, two of them being barren wastelands.&&Like the last Indiana Jones?&&>a great experience...but not a great movie.

Nail/head.

I loved it...superficiality without thinking about it too much. 

But the more I think about it the more problems I have with it.&&yeah it's legit the first SW movie that I liked to watch the first time but have absolutely no want/need to watch again&&Solo is gonna be awful simply for the fact that nobody wants the fucking movie.

Solo doesn't need a grandios backstory. He doesn't need *anything*. His rise is detailed perfectly in the original trilogy. He was a scoundrel, (and continued to be, pretty much), chanced into Luke Skywalker and got caught up in a rebellion he didn't want to be part of. He tried to cut and run but his conscience or whatever caught up to him and he came back and literally saved the day, and several planets, by helping Luke blow up the death star.

He was a nobody. He was a chance meeting. A happenstance that built to something later on.

So a precursor movie to that character will either be A) shoehorned grandios crap that takes the canon and breaks it over its knee.

Or B) a slow-paced story with extremely low stakes (since we already know the outcome of everything) that serves absolutely no purpose.

Nobody is asking for this movie.

And it's going to burn because of that.&&""It was never going to match TFA..."" 

That surprises me because I had expectations that this would the more rewatchable one.&&I love it. I really wish this could be given as an official response to Disney executives when they are presented with low box office numbers. &&It’s amazing to me how difficult it really was to sit through TLJ. Say what you want about the movie, but for something with generally good effects and a huge budget, I wasn’t expecting to get bored halfway through. It was just way too long and not very _consistently_ interesting, imo.

My boyfriend (who’s a bigger SW fan than me) always watches movies at least a few times in order to clarify his opinions and even he doesn’t want to rewatch it.

It’s not just you, unfortunately. &&I realized partway  through I'd rather be watching something else. I've almost never considered leaving a theatre out of boredom and am still a little stunned that the notion crossed my mind during goddamn Star Wars.&&Same for me. The excitement around TFA amongst my friends immediately evaporated with TLJ. Zero interest in a second viewing. &&Yeah and I'm not some diehard SW purist at all, but a lot of TLJ just didn't fully work. It felt more like a Star Wars themed Marvel movie. 

TFA, though the plot wasn't super ambitious, definitely felt like SW. That quality of optimism and humor mixed with all sorts of themes.

Adam Driver did great in TLJ though, which is what I expected. He's a great actor and I knew that he would do great as a more morally ambiguous villain&&>I barely sat through TLJ, and I can't imagine doing it again.

Ouch. I feel you. I only sat because I was hoping it would get better. &&I just hated how allll the plotlines given weight and time in TFA were all basically red herrings. 

Nothing from TFA carried over. You could watch TFA on mute and the Last Jedi would have the same weight. &&This is pretty much how I felt. The characters are, aside from maybe Kylo, largely in the same place they were when the movie started. It didn't feel like there was any real moment of growth or progression of a character arc. 

I think it was a mistake to have it take place instantly after the first movie ended. They could have had Rey on the island for a while, show the rebellion in rougher shape from repeated attacks from the first order, Finn struggling with his recovery...

The whole thing just felt like filler. &&Man, I had trouble watching TFA more than once. It lifts so much from A New Hope that it really hurt the film for me. JJ is good at the mystery box thing, but he didn't have any plan at all for those mysteries.&&Which is why I stayed off Reddit the week before release. It's Reddit...people are cunts. To expect anything else is just being naïve.&&Same. That was honestly just mean spirited, and you know the perpetrator will think ""I'm so edgy and cool for living up to the subreddit name!"" When obviously it's intended for dark humor, and not total dick moves.&&Sub is so retardedly cringy. 9/11 jokes are still a thing? And Jews in ovens for the 100th time. It's just dumb as fuck. &&Yes. For me, it was the first statement of the opening crawl. “The First Order Reigns.”

Umm...pretty sure they got dealt a substantially crushing blow in TFA. So right away it felt like this was saying ‘Screw the last thing, this is what’s happening now’&&That [""your mother""](#spoiler) joke (I wouldn't personally consider that a spoiler but hey) made my eyes roll so far back into my head. I wish they had stayed there so that I didn't have to witness the rest of it...

Alright that's a bit dramatic but you know what I mean&&Yeah as far as funny lines, these new Star Wars are a lot like Marvel movies. Makes sense, same studio. Monopoly Mouse strikes again. &&> it still being Empire VS Rebels

Am I the only person that has *no fucking idea* what is going on with that? Haven't the ""rebels"" been in charge for like 30 years and all they did was upgrade their X-Wings while the splinter cell of the remnants of the Empire have capital ships that make the death star look like a toy?

Edit: fuck the novels and anyone suggesting them. No one should be expected to read some bullshit side story to ""understand"" why the movie is complete nonsense

Edit: really? Like Nazi Germany? I'm no naziologist here but pretty sure the nazis were*n't* developing the goddamn plane from Captain America: First Avenger between world wars, while not in control of Germany - the equivalent of what happens in TLJ

Edit: Yes, I saw TFA, that in *no way* addresses my complaint&&This was my main problem with TFA. I didn't understand what was going on with the conflict. I could figure out on my own that the First Order was the Empire 2.0. But the movie really made no effort to explain what the Resistance was and why it was separate from the Republic. &&The lack of context is a serious problem. The only reason it doesn’t totally fuck the films up is because people carry into it the original trilogy context of the good plucky rebellion vs the evil empire, which actually is or should be (given the overthrow of the empire and all that at the end of ROTJ) the wrong context for the new one. Emotionally, of course, it’s the correct context in terms of mirroring the OT, but it totally ignores the political situation post battle of endor; there is no development of the broader story. 

Edit: as an aside - as with, say the Hobbit or LOTR, it is the allusions or references to a much bigger universe / mythology that actually makes the films a part of something bigger; a grander vision. The OT did this perfectly, whereas it’s this bigger picture that is totally missing from these new films. People say ‘the books fill it out’, I don’t want it filled out, I want it to inspire my own imagination not my bewilderment and searching for clues / orientation. 

For all Lucas’ awful script writing / direction skills, he clearly is very good at world building. If they had let him write it and stipulated some guidance on him developing a story and then had a separate script writer and director, I’m sure they would have come up with something awesome. I say this setup paid off for ESB and RTJ. 

Pity Disney just wanted to rush something out and make money, instead of actually developing it. If you stand back, what story actually needs to be told and what story are they telling (never mind the how)? 

For what it’s worth, I think TLJ has a lot of great elements, but without any link to a) the Star Wars Lore and b) any actually social or political context for the events, it suspended in mid air and really baffling for casual and serious fans. &&*This* is my real problem with TLJ. The universe they've set up still doesn't make sense, so I can't bring myself to care about it. Even the prequels, lifeless as they were, somehow managed to feel more ""real"" than this.

The plot holes don't matter to me.&&basically Johnson said fuck u to JJ's ideas/arching plot lines in TFA and then decided to troll the die hard fan base mixed with marvel movie dialog.  &&90% of Finn's storyline could have been cut. &&False endings. I was ready to leave several times at the end of the movie. Also, there were several characters that weren't needed.&&That, the lame jokes and the Leia scene are my big complaints&&I must have thought to myself ""I gotta pee, but surely it's almost over."" ten times. &&Everything that doesn't involve Luke, Rey and Kylo is pointless and or bad. The force stuff, which was still somewhat unsatisfying, was the only thing that felt like it would have belonged in the other movies. &&Maybe not have a third of the movie be a recreation of the OJ Simpson car chase.&&It was perhaps the most awkward cinema experience I've ever had. I'm in the 50% who liked TFA; it didn't take long for me to relax into it. I actually laughed. Some good one-liners in Rogue One, too. With TLJ, I never relaxed. Everything felt unmemorable, arbitrary.&&[removed]&&I honestly found that in a few scenes, ones that should be powerful and awe-inspiring, were cheekily undercut with a joke that made it feel almost like the movie was afraid of its roots. It's STAR WARS, it's not Avengers, so every joke that isn't tonally relevant becomes super shallow and takes you out of the universe. &&I didn't mind the joke attempts for the most part and I actually really liked Mark Hamill's delivery of them. What did bother me was how many times BB8 saved the day. BB8 is the new trilogy's equivalent of the minions in Despicable Me. &&It doesn't have a protagonist. The same problem TPM suffered from.

It's supposed to be Rey, it's trying to be Luke. Finn and Poe are useless subplots to keep them busy when one of them should have died in TFA. (It was originally written to be Poe dying in the opening escape, but they brought him back because the character is so good and the actor so charismatic in the role).

Splitting time for two useless subplots drags the whole film down.

And based on Poe's importance, Finn should have died. In TFA, or actually have the balls to do it in this one.&&right and like, ""oh remember this also happened?"" and then two minutes later ""oh and this!""

to me that means there was no central thrust, just a bunch of ideas and visuals strung together for 2h30m&&At least that had the excuse of being politics.&&I'm actually surprised this isn't used more often as a tactic.  Imagine ramming a Mon Calamari Cruiser at light speed into a Death Star ....&&Oh, we don’t have to wait that long to notice that the suits are already scared.

Remember that perception matters in Hollywood ...&&Yea, I was a huge Star Trek fan until I realized that JJ and his over-hyped minions ... are the real Death Star.

Or whatever Starkiller Base jargon they called it in the Force Awakens.&&Yes! They believe since the PT wasn't very well received then they should completely ignore it like it never happened. Surely 1 and 2 weren't great but man did it add so much to the overall universe including 3. &&Seriously.  /r/StarWars is in a tizzy insisting this is only some vocal minority that dislikes the film, but I think it's becoming clear as time goes on how the film is really being perceived.&&My grocery store has Star Wars sparkling cider and energy drinks. it's not fun&&Exactly, I think more""official"" SW is what we all wanted instead of the patches and new collections of the same movies. The problem is that they are finally understanding why Lucas couldn't find directors and producers for the prequels, no one wants to mess with that monster SW is and ruin it&&Every time it seems like they're about to do something risky ([Finn sacrificing himself, Rey joining up with Kylo, having the jedi be over instead of having Rey be ""the next jedi"" at the end, doing something with the theme of good/evil being more complicated](#spoiler)), they back off.  The movie has good ideas, and it commits to none of them.
&&That would've been perfect. The rest of the film would still have been BS, but that would have been a worthy send-off for Leia. Completely out of left field, and acting as a part of Kylo's character arc. It was right there, all they had to do was let her die with dignity.&&I was bummed to see Hux turned into a slap stick character.  He had potential to be scary, now he's goofy.&&People have disagreed with me over this, but it effected the movies tone and the rest of my viewing experience. 
The crazy thing is to contrast the tone, competency, and ultimate portrayal between the First Order in The Last Jedi to last year's Empire in Rouge One.
Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic is such a far cry from anything we see from The First Order. &&Just one example: Finn crashed his plane in front of the empire forces, and yet was back inside the base in the next scene. Did his love interest make it too? I can't remember. If so, that makes it even more ridiculous given she was unconscious.&&I was literally begging the movie to let [Finn sacrifice himself to destroy the cannon.](#spoiler) At least then the movie would have done something interesting with *one* of it's characters.

Instead they felt like making a movie with zero actual tension.&&[deleted]&&Finn vs phasma was silly. It was supposed to be tense but ended up just lame.&&[deleted]&&My local theater is open year around and is packed on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day&&scewered by Xmas? more likely screwed by their own release schedule. Humans invented the calendars for a reason. :>&&> screwed over

Those poor guys, how will they manage. Time to wrap up the franchise.&&>theaters in my area closed around 5:00 PM

That's nice, wished that happened to the theater I worked at... But you do get time and a half after 6pm on Christmas Eve though.
&&Lol as someone who hasn't seen TLJ I have absolutely no idea what that picture means &&My Jewish friends growing up spent Christmas at the movies. &&It's literally the busiest time of every theater's year. 

Source: was a manager at a theater.&&I read somewhere that people were blaming Russian bots for bad reviews lmao&&And with excellent reviews, and people loving it, it has mass appeal. I know a ton of people who didn't go see Star Wars, because they aren't into Sci-fi. But pretty much everyone I know is planning to see Jumanji. And it helps that it was a surprisingly awesome for just a stupid action movie.&&It honestly amazes me that people don't think Rotten Tomatoes reviewers are paid shills.

Big budget movies have SO MUCH riding on a ""certified fresh"" rating.&&> [Indian Jones](https://i.imgur.com/zxMRW2M.jpg)&&[removed]&&Honestly, I think Solo would make a great TV show. His main story arc before meeting Luke simply isn't interesting nor contained enough to be a good movie. But give him a show, let him run supplies, get into trouble, work with the Hutts, develop the Chewbacca and Lando relationships, avoid the empire.

But even that is not what that universe needs. Star Wars needs to stay big. We needed a post-RotJ political intrigue film or show, showing the Galaxy falling back into place after the Emperor is destroyed. We needed to see Luke rebuilding the Jedi Temple/Order, in conflict with politicians who would control it. We need to see Leia struggle to be a fair ruler once he tastes power.

Instead, we will get Solo. Obi-Wan. Boba Fett. I bet Vader or Maul get films. And just wait for the reboots; we've rebooted Spider-Man three times since Phantom Menace.&&And this is a huge problem, most people feel this way. I would love to love this movie. I’d love to go back a few times and be entertained by good ol Star Wars. It just won’t happen with this movie. How can they make this better? Fire Kathleen Kennedy and start over with Luke and Han alive. Will that happen? 100% No.&&Same. I've seen every single Star Wars films multiple times. I am usually good for several viewings. I don't think I'll watch this one again, even when it comes out on video/streaming. It was long, arduous, and boring in parts. They had a few great scenes and promising developments, but unfortunately wasted almost every opportunity &&The humor most likely solidified TLJ seeming like a marvel movie, and Marvel’s humor just doesn’t work with SW. That, and how there wasn’t much at stake. As soon as a movie shows how it cares more about “gotcha” moments and killing off extras or side characters rather than actually creating tension, the viewer knows that there’s nothing to worry about. If the viewer both is no longer invested in the characters AND the movie isn’t at least fun to watch, then what even is there?

At least Marvel has source material and focuses on making entertaining rather than shocking or innovative movies.

Agree on the Adam Driver part, his character arc (and his acting) have been incredibly solid over the last two movies. &&[removed]&&Im starting to hate Finn and BB-8 am i supposed to care about them?&&I think that's what's hurting this new Star Wars: the lack of long-term plans.

Someone needs to come in. Create a basic outline of a plot for X amount of movies and then writers and directors can do their thing like Lucas used to do.&&Yeah I can't imagine sitting through that 5 times in a few weeks... There weren't really things hidden, nothing to pick up on, and the plot was basically a carbon copy&&And as they both drowned, the Frog asked the Scorpion, ""Why have you done this? Now we will both die.""

To which the Scorpion replied, ""But I am a Scorpion. It is in my nature."" &&It's completely unavoidable. Something that short and succinct could have been posted anywhere. Somebody could have put stickers in your apartment elevator or dragged it behind an airplane.  I had Saw ruined for me by a guy who stood up at the beginning of the movie *in the theater* and yelled out the ending. &&I've already seen the movie, mind PMing me what the spoiler was? 

Edit: I got it now, thanks, jar jar is snoke&&I agree 100%. 

Like 4 years ago, it was pretty different in my memory. Really dark humor, but often funny. Then it got taken over by what I assume are 13 year old alt-right wannabes.

The jokes aren't even funny, and if you call it out, they'll just say you're too sensitive. It's so embarrassing. &&Yeah ya know we lost like the most powerful weapon ever, but I mean... we're still good. &&Its because the dark side invested in bitcoin&&That's one of the criticisms really. There was a lot of opportunities to explore The First Order a little more but Rian Johnson decided to not focus on that at all. So it looks like if we'll be getting anything it will be in the next movie. This isn't all on Johnson, a lot of blame goes to the heads of the Star Wars brand at Disney as they went forward without any real plan for what this trilogy was going to be.&&Yeah, TFA did a really poor job of explaining the state of the galaxy which makes it seems like rebels vs the First Order. Given that it was the first in the sequel trilogy and thus is responsible for setting the stage... that is inexcusable, and it inevitably brings down the sequels because of it. Even the prequels did a better job at explaining the state of the galaxy, despite everything else about them. 

&&It's all explained fairly well in the novels and stuff but that 100% should *not* be required to understand the movie.&&That's the problem with these movies. The companion novels answer a lot of questions that should be answered by the movies.

[The New Republic has spent the last 30 years demilitarizing because of how weaponized the Empire was. The Resistance are the folks who wouldn't ""hand in their guns"". Meanwhile, the First Order has spent the same time acquiring every weapon they can get their hands on.](/spoiler)&&>all they did was upgrade their X-Wings

Knowing how Star Wars space combat was based on WWII, this bugs me, like, a lot. One of the cool things I've seen almost tropishly across sci-fi is that you start to see even the ""fan favorite"" tech getting cycled out towards the end of the war. In Gundam, Zeon introduces their GM-slaying Gelgoog, but it's too late in the war for them to make a strategic difference. In Star Wars, the X-wing was getting cycled out for B-Wings, IIRC *(EDIT: A few have pointed out that B-Wings replaced Y-Wings. X-Wings were originally replaced by [E-Wings](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/E-wing_escort_starfighter) in the EU)*. I feel like this echoes the development of the Me 163, Me 262, Meteor Mk. 1, and the ""wunderweapons"" like Ho 229 from our own history very well, and that kind of stuff is what binds the universe to its own reality.

In real-world allegory, yes, you can upgrade tech to a certain degree, but 30 years for what's essentially an ""ASF"" is a *long* time to keep in service. X-Wings would've been relegated to ground attack/CAS if not slowly cycled out of service for better fighters, even with ""upgrades"".

I can totally maintain suspension of disbelief with sound in space combat and lasers and non-Newtonian physics, because Star Wars. But for whatever reason, the logistics breaks me.&&You had to read side material to figure that out. You should never have to read side material. Previous movies should be the only thing you need.&&I have so many problems with Snoke (without spoilering). I also have massive problems with Rey being able to duel effectively. She had zero ability to resist force attacks - Ren should kill her with force lightning in the first five seconds. She has no training in how to deal with a DJK and in-universe this would be a swift death.&&I love the concept of the prequels. Galactic politics, as much as people hate on it, is super interesting to me. They have a lot of interesting planets and species, they just fail in the execution of just about everything.

Basically, I want to love the prequels, they just make it impossible.&&Do you mean Rose's storyline. Finn was basically just there to make Rose's story&&DUDE. That scene stands out as one of the biggest mistakes in the movie if you ask me.&&As the shit was going down on the ship, I was thinking, “I’m really not feeling this movie overall, but hot damn this finale is solid.” Then I realized the fox creatures and “snow” planet from the trailer had not been seen, and I was depressed that there was at least another half hour to go. Even for those that liked it, I don’t see how anybody could not have issues with the structure and pacing of this movie.&&agreed; the whole sideplot of [the trip to get the codebreaker](#spoiler) seemed completely unnecessary. Like, it added nothing to the film, the equivalent of a sidequest in a videogame. Very, very weird.&&The thing with TFA is it was basically a soft reboot and a mild remake. If you can accept that you can enjoy it for what it was. The problem is that all the doors it opened up were immediately slammed shut in TLJ. TFA allowed for a bunch of really awesome stories to be told and Rian Johnson was basically like ""Fuck TFA and everything about it."" I'm surprised they even used the island from the end of TFA that's how much Johnson shit on it.&&Yeah. Now we're back to the same plot. I hope JJ can come up with something interesting with what he was given.&&The second time I saw the movie the theater was silent pretty much the whole time and it really changed the tone of a lot of these moments for me. &&Totally agree. So much of the potential emotional power of the movie was undone for me by shitty, Avengers-style quips. Many of them felt totally out of character, too, in addition to being completely ignorant of context. I get that comic relief is part and parcel of a Star Wars film, but so much of what was in The Last Jedi felt so awkward.&&> BB8 is the new trilogy's equivalent of the minions in Despicable Me.

This would explain why BB8 has a coin slot and coin shooter and why we keep getting stupid cut away gags of BB8 doing something that's supposed to be funny.

Ship repair shouldn't be funny. It's precise work, lives are on the line, the fate of a battle is at stake. This is not a time to attempt slap stick comedy. Nobody laughed when R2 got fried but BB8 is immortal and everyone in movie and out knows it.&&Gotta sell those merch to the kids somehow&&I remember Ebert disparagingly referring to that type of movie as “storyboard driven development” or something.

Come up with the visuals, then add some bullshit to string them together.

Of course, the visuals here are like giant walkers crossing a flat plain, so maybe even that’s too generous.&&If flying things at hyper space into other things does this, why isn't it the main weapon technology used? The slow as hell Lazer canons look like bow and arrows compared to it.  &&Imagine Ackbar having been the one to go Kamikaze instead of some lady that teleported into the movie 10 minutes ago.&&I would LOVE a film set in the Prequel Trilogy time period as long as it had a great story, good enough acting, and as long as it was done by a good director. &&There's a long list of things I'd do to get a Vader movie that picks up where Episode 3 ends and ends right before he comes onto the scene in Rogue One. &&I really hope box office continues to drop dramatically. Disney really needs a solid hit to the head with this one. After the Battlefront II debacle, and now TLJ, im ok with dragging Disney and the Star Wars brand through the mud. 

What they should do, is Cancel Solo because I can already see a vocal majority being upset with that. Take a little extra time and clean up episode 9 and use it to re-evaluate what Star Wars is. Then start something that has nothing to do with the original trilogy. Maybe focus on cleaning up the pre-equals. Build up the lore and the universe. Right now, they are just piggy backing off the OT and butchering it. &&Moichendising!

Spaceballs the lunch box! Spaceballs the flamethrower!&&Dude I liked the film (7/10) but you nailed one of my biggest problems with it. Thank you.&&Yeah, I really like the Gleesons as actors (in Bruges in my favourite dark comedy) but that opening “can he hear me?” scene really took away from the character. He slowly redeemed it over the course of the film, especially with the holstering of the pistol, etc&&The general of the dreadnaught at the beginning was more interesting than Hux&&I totally agree with you. Right from the start the tone of TLJ felt so cheesy. It honestly made me feel like I was watching a marvel movie or something. Poe teasing Hux and Luke tossing the lightsaber off the cliff were what made me realize Rian Johnson has an fundamentally different view of what a Star Wars story is than JJ Abrams, or even Lucas. A lot of things bothered me about The Last Jedi but the tone discrepancy is what bothered me the most. &&You don't even have to compare TLJ to Rogue One.  TFA had the same issues with completely out of place humor and unthreatening villains.  Krenic, despite not having force powers (or anything other than his brain and a blaster, really) was more threatening than Kylo, Snoke, and Hux **combined**.  

And don't get me started on that Vader sequence at the end.  Not only was it the best apology ever for not getting Jedi battles otherwise in the film, but it was a reminder of how great Star Wars villains used to be.  &&Yes they both magically made it back into the salt mine after Rose crashed her ship into Finn about 10 ft in front of the empire soldiers. &&Same, when he was on the collision course I was hoping that the writers/directors would have the balls to follow through, which would make it mean something.....instead......&&Honestly, I'd have killed him at the failed mission. 
The movie is about failure yet most of the failure comes without direct consequences for the bad judgement call.&&I know I am repeating myself constantly, but

THAT'S HOW WE SAVE EVERYONE, SILLY! - said the girl after preventing a heroic sacrifice that would stop TFO from opening the fortress doors, which would buy the Resistance hours or days, instead of being immediatly assaulted by ground troops (had Luke not shown up)&&Yeah that would have been so much better. Rose was so unnecessary.&&Yeah, as an ex-movie theater employee, I worked every holiday in high school. Closing at 5 would have been amazing.&&Well they didn't want to step on Coco. And prior to that they didn't want to step on Thor.

 #MonopolyProblems&&Calendars, how do they work?&&[deleted]&&There’s just a scene with Kylo Ren shirtless and he looks really wide for some reason; internet turned it into a meme.&&Before or after the Chinese restaurant?&&This ones just insulting. Like I can’t decide for myself that I don’t like the movie and I have to be a Russian bot net or something.&&Clearly the Russian bots are also to blame for the box-office drop.&&I feel like I engage with Disney robots at time.  I've been told things like

 ""the Leía scene literally made me cry because of how absolutely beautiful it was"" 

""Luke's darker character finally added some depth to his development"". 

""This is hands down the best SW I've ever seen. I'll be watching it x more times.""

And here I am thinking, man I completely think the polar opposite on every single one of these. &&That's cause they think the anger against this film is a right wing thing for some reason. They think that only neo Nazis type people don't like the movie because they allow female leads and un aesthetic Asians.  

I disagree completely.  I thought TFA was a solid reboot with a few problems however they seem less integrated an all diverse cast with a female lead. No one was really upset with that. &&Can't believe Star Wars and  jumanji with the rock are even in the same sentence &&Jumanji was fantastic. I expected it to be mediocre and was blown away. Incredible writing for an adventure comedy. Jack Black made the movie. &&Because people don't realize how it works. When they think of a movie critic, they think of Roger Ebert or some shit analyzing a movie with a clipboard in a theater. Critics now are people who live on twitter, that get to go to sick parties thrown by the studios, get to have set visits, get comic con press passes and interviews with all the stars, and all that is contingent on the critics supplying good reviews.

If youre the one dude in the movie critic circle who trashed Star Wars, good luck getting invited to the next premier with [life size AT-AT walkers, open bars, and every celebrity ever](https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2017/dec/10/star-wars-the-last-jedi-world-premiere-in-pictures), meanwhile all your buddies who shut up about Star Wars last time get to live it up&&I 100% thought that was her death scene and was totally cool with it, instead she survived for some goddamned reason and Disney said they won't be doing cgi so is she just not going to be in the next movie at all? Just some offhand reference she went somewhere or died?&&The only Solo backstory that can and did work were the Brian Daley ""Han Solo Adventures"" trilogy, and they explicitly avoided messing with any movie canon at all. All they did was give the audience what they really wanted, which was more Solo and Chewie doing awesome space scoundrel stuff.&&> give him a show, let him run supplies, get into trouble, work with the Hutts, develop the Chewbacca and Lando relationships, avoid the empire.

OK. And how does his character change?

That's the point, a story is not just a list of things that happen. Even if those things are cool.

I have no need or desire to see what was up with Han before he's in that cantina in Tatooine. Because Han's story truly begins when he meets Luke. First we see him as this callous amoral smuggler who's just in it for the money. Then he comes back to save his friends at the end. And in ESB and ROTJ he starts to care for Leia and for the cause of the Rebellion. His character grows and changes and therefore he has a reason to be in the movies. 

All the ""Solo"" movie is gonna be, is either 1.5 hours of ANH Han being ANH Han which is boring. Or they're going to break his character by rehashing the same arc (sort of like Into Darkness rehashed the same character arcs from Star Trek 09) or by making him be ROTJ Han regressing to ANH Han or something stupid like that.

&&[deleted]&&They should have died. Too many “clutch” moments in that film. Heck Finn lost to Captain Phasma and Rose (who was poorly written and kind of over acted) was just about dead as well. 

Too much luck. They would throw characters into impossible scenarios and instead lf having the hero’s actually surpass the scenarios the writers realized they couldn’t and just came up with some lucky escape. BB-8 was like their “well we’re stuck how do we keep the story moving” character - really mote lf a plot device than anything.

One thing I will say: Mark Hamil was excellent. &&Supposed to? Yeah disney wants you to buy their BB-8 shit. Do they matter to the story? Nah not really&&BB-8 controlling an AT-ST to take out a Platoon of storm troopers was the second dumbest moment in all of star wars (behind Leia floating through space). Why wouldn't the rebellion just buy a thousand bb units? They seem to be unstoppable. &&lol that is a whole new level of pathetic asshole. I wonder if that was a dare or a bet, how disgruntled would someone have to be to do that and also get enjoyment out of it.&&So did Han but no one has access to his.&&No it's because of that casino planet. Something something war profiteering &&This is good for Bitcoin.&&Come to the dark side. We had cookies but frank told us to invest in bitcoins&&Man I was so pissed off when I found out that JJ just made the first one and was like good luck without any idea of what the overall tone of the trilogy would be. You’d think this would have been priority number 1 when they were making a new trilogy. Let’s get the general story outline down but no, I’m JJ and I love my mystery boxes bullshit.&&I mean, who the fuck is Snoke? He was a hologram now he's just a gross dude. He seems he be supremely powerful and can sense force and plant memories and mind control, but can't see that his apprentice is going to kill him? He was a bitch at the end of it. &&Plus a lot of anger comes  from TLJ not fixing TFA's omissions and mistakes with world building, scale, or general direction.

When a whole movie sets up and defines the basic conflict, there isn't a lot that can be done about it in the direct sequel.&&[deleted]&&The world building in the prequels is phenomenal, and the complete and utter lack of world building in the sequels is a huge mistake.&&Exactly. People loved TFA because of the fanservice, and now they’re pissy that TLJ doesn’t fit into any kind of context. The problem is that TFA did not establish ANY kind of meaningful context/world building, so Rian Johnson was clearly like “fuck it, let’s have some fun!”&&Even worse, the novels and films seem to contradict each other. In the novels, the First Order is essentially the Nazis after the fall of Germany where they set up a base in South America, but the First Order is more successful in building back up a little, but not enough for anyone to really care much about them.

The TLJ opening scroll starts with “The first order reigns.” Wtf? Are they a small entity attempting to gain control or do they have it? Was blowing up four planets in TFA all it took to conquer the galaxy?&&Are you talking about Bloodlines? Because even that book does not explain the massive ressources the First Order has. It explains that several heads of state / industrialists supported the formation of a splinter group (like the First Order is in TFA), but how they suddenly rule the Galaxy with ressources the same as the old Empire is NOT explained. The Empire needed the whole Clone Wars and several years of Galaxy-spanning war to built up its military machine. The First Order suddenly has ""enough Star Destroyers to rule the Galaxy"" (Quote Canon-game Battlefront II), a Planet-sized superweapon and ""Mega""-Stardestroyers just because they were supported by a couple rich guys?&&[deleted]&&The whole point of erasing the Expanded Universe was so that people wouldn't be confused by the state of the galaxy... And now they tell you to read the books to understand, while as a bonus even the super nerds who want to read everything have a very limited number of books to explain the background.&&That actually makes no sense though. They should have splintered into warring factions rather than just be lol lets all give up our weapons. &&I can understand why the New Republic wouldn't want to be like the Empire, but it seems really goddamn stupid to give away all your weapons when the remnants of the Empire apparently still have a shitload of firepower. &&That doesn't even make any sense.&&Wow. That's a terrible idea. The entire reason the Empire grew to power to begin with was because of the lack of Republic military. For a thousand years the Republic relied on the Jedi to literally do ANYTHING that a regular military was used for. This is what allowed shit like entire planets being blockaded by corporations. Because the Republic literally couldn't do anything to stop them.

Then when a legitimate war broke out they had to rely on clones to do everything because they didn't have an army and got blind sided by the Confederacy. And lo and behold, the clones were loyal to the Emperor.

It sounds like the New Republic are a bunch of fucking idiots that didn't learn from the mistakes of the previous government. Yeah, being as militarized and military focused as the Empire is stupid, but by god having no military is what led to the Empire seizing control to begin with! Even more dumb when they're a fledgling government not fully in control of the galaxy and uncontested in rule, which at least the old Republic at least could claim. They are literally making the same mistakes that will lead to a second Empire. &&that's dumb&&Would take like 5 minutes of screen time to get this across.  Considering TLJ had about 30 pointless minutes it would be worth it.&&Especially not if the movie is two and half goddamn hours long.&&Yeah, it completely ursups Lucas's vision of ""tiered canon"" for Star Wars, where the movies are the most canon, television next, and books and stuff after. Where all the other media simply supplements and enhances the movies. Instead we have requirements to follow those other materials just in order to follow the movie.

It's honestly just a huge cash grab. This is exactly what I was afraid of when I heard about Disney's acquisition.&&Rose felt pointless and forced&&[deleted]&&The worst part is, [they could have saved that scene entirely by having her use the force to grab onto something in the bridge at the last possible moment before she got sucked out. Same end result of Leia using the force to save herself, but it looks a lot less stupid.](#spoiler)&&I just laughed at how ridiculous it was.&&A guy I was sitting near went.

I'm Mary Poppins Y'all, during that scene&&The Leia scene could have been completely eliminated without changing anything at all. I know this because I was in the bathroom during that scene when I watched it the first time and I had no idea she had a near-death experience when I got back. 

If I'm being really cynical, it seems like they wanted to take advantage of Carrie Fisher's death and leave us thinking that this would be how she died. &&It felt like at some points, Rian Johnson was literally mocking those in the audience who cared about these bigger picture story lines. 

Who is this mysterious figure named Snoke who's apparently existed since before even the events in Phantom Menace, yet has remained anonymous and uninvolved in the happenings of the galaxy? ""Who cares! Nothing's supposed to matter, that's the fun!"" 

How is it that the Rebels, after wiping out the entire political and military leadership of the Empire, is in a worse position than it was even in A New Hope? ""Fuck it, you're dumb for caring, Star Wars has always been stupid!"" 

There were a few other parts, including one scene where Kylo Ren may as well have looked at the audience after saying his line, shrugged and winked. &&This is what really bothered me. I was so interested to see where they went with a few characters and the answer is basically nowhere. They were introduced and dismissed with barely a whimper.&&""TLJ was just a fever dream that Rey had while walking up the island. It was all a dream and she's just about to meet Luke for the first time""&&JJ doesn't come up with interesting stuff, that's not his thing. He's leaned to copy Spielberg's style, but an interesting story and/or mystery isn't important to him. He may come up with a lot of stuff that seems intriguing, but that's only because you've learned to expect that mystery to resolved.&&The Allahu Ackbar memes would be incredible&&That would certainly have been a better death for him than getting sucked into the vacuum of space.

RIP Gial Ackbar&&A Republic Commando movie, maybe full CGI, it would be also relative cheap since they would only need Temuera Morrison to dub everyone.&&I want to see the Order 66 done justice. Not just a montage, but an actual movie centered around that event.&&This is actually an instance where I'd rather have a video game. Give us a Force Unleashed type game where Vader has to grapple with his nature while tracking down and slaughtering still living Jedi.&&Exactly. The call was something I would expect Chris Pratt to be doing in GOTG, not star wars. This film was very much toned down at the beginning
&&Instead we'll get a love triangle now. Because that's what the new series has been lacking till now, romance.&&The only people who died didn't matter. Everyone in the Resistance we care about made it to be one of the last 10 people left. How surprising.&&[deleted]&&""We need to save the ones we love!"" (kisses, as the door protecting their friends gets blown up in the background)&&I hated everything about Rose. Horrible actor/acting and horribly written. Hate her so much. &&omg yes.   That was one of several times I felt emotion at this movie, and that emotion was annoyance.
 
like wtf was that about?  

[she screwed that attack up for no reason and doomed so many to death just because she suddenly loves this guy she just met and has had no real connection with on screen?  we're supposed to buy into that?  it's awful.](#spoiler)

 
&&Wow that's actually a good point. When you're releasing half the major content you kinda gotta work around you own schedule to make the most money. &&But they DID step on my man Tommy Wiseau&&Like magnets, but different &&Ben Swolo&&The waist on his pants is really high, makes his torso look shorter/wider&&Yeah, there's a guy at work who is now saying I'm in agreement with the Alt Right since I disliked the movie&&How do you _know_ you're not a Russian bot? &&Yea its annoying as fuck. A friend of mine who sucks Disneys dick for some reason said I just bandwagon on the hate. Eve though I genuinly disliked the movie.&&I think I want to go see Jumanji after feeling terrible about Episode VIII. &&I was incredibly impressed that they would kill her so suddenly and then I immediately groaned the biggest groan ever when I realized she wasnt actually dead. They should have just let her die there. She isnt even needed for the rest of the movie.&&I don't know that it's impossible to have a character arc for han prior to ANH, I just don't trust disney to do it well, and it's not a movie I want to see. 

Star Wars doesn't need to be extended back stories for everyone who appeared on screen for ten seconds in the original trilogy. I don't need the story of where lobot got his headgear, or why Willrow Hood was carrying an ice cream maker through cloud city.  
&&[deleted]&&I don't think killing them is necessary but at least rough them up, there has to be some consecuences for failing so utterly ha. 

BB-8 showing up in the AT is going to haunt me in nigthmares for months such a ridiculous scene

I enjoyed most of the Luke, Kylo and Rey stuff they were the highlight of the movie for me &&Which is a shame because i really felt like they did matter in The Force Awakens, but the Finn storyline in The Last Jedi was so disconnected from the main story that i just didn't care.&&Porgs too were there just for merch purposes.. shoehorned in just enough times to make it a 'thing'&&Because BB-8 is the only droid in the movie that has plot armor&&And why, I say why the fuck didn't BB-8 and BB-H8 have a battle royale?&&Han scratched his private key onto the back of his carbonite block and dropped it down the sarlacc pit. They retrieve that and rescue a partially digested boba fett in episode 9.


I've also got a script in the works for Pacific rim vs Narnia where humanity fights to put the lion and witch back in the wardrobe. Hit me up Disney.&&Talk about cold storage&&The Rebels should demand their money back. The stuff they were sold is barely above par versus their previous arms. &&I thought this was interesting from a fan who mostly loved the ships and weapons of SW growing up: [Seinar Fleet Systems](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sienar_Fleet_Systems/Legends). I was hoping for tie-ins to those companies. However, it was kind of a weird and silly plot point.&&THE CHILDREN! SAVE THE CHILDREN! AND THE HORSES! gd dmn rich people!&&Just saw it yesterday, but gods everything about the casino planet was hot garbage. &&The blame doesn't fully lie on him. He was hired to do one film, and he did that film. The big issue is with the top dog Kathleen Kennedy having absolutely zero idea what to do with the future of Star Wars so she's instead lumped the job onto each successive new director to do it for her. I enjoyed both films, but they feel very disjointed and lacking any cohesion. Things could have been a lot better is my main issue with the sequel trilogy, especially after seeing some of the TFA concept art. We really could have had something special if the right people were put in charge with a cohesive vision for the new trilogy. &&And why does he look like a sweet potato? And why does he talk and act like one of the prophets from Halo 2?&&He can body slam people from another star destroyer!&&His dialogue was hilariously bad right before that part.

I can see all of his thoughts! He'll never betray me! Oh my god, he betrayed me!&&He did sense what his apprentice was going to do, just was too cocksure to realize the target wasn't Rey.

But I agree, WTF is Snoke's backstory?  The shift from hologram to live person was inelegant.  Who is Snoke?  How did they rise to power?&&Yo and what happened to The Knights of Ren who even Snoke makes a big deal about in TFA. I'm just disapointed JJ will have to shoehorn all the plot devices in the last chapter and it again will be lame. What is Maaz, what and who are The Knights of Ren and how did they die/live? What is up with Ren's parents and backstory, how did The First Order come to power again and basically become the rehashed Empire after they were defeated, and what the heck is Snoke's backstory and where was he during the OT, he is cleary old as fuck and was around then, who trained him? So much stuff they left in the dust.&&The worldbuilding is like 75% of what makes both the original and prequel trilogies interesting. Without that worldbuilding... what's there to be excited about? 

If we don't know anything about anyone or anything - why should we care? 

That partially ties into half of why I'm dissatisfied with TLJ - it thinks it's being clever by 'answering' these mysteries with 'unexpected' answers, but it's just simply not. It's just extremely dissatisfying and disappointing, and that leaves a bitter taste. It's not clever or revolutionary to set up a mystery and then answer it in the most boringly mundane way possibly. &&That’s exactly my main issue. I don’t really need much to enjoy a Star Wars film, but I want that immersive quality. Lucas let us simmer in each world, which is why I can sit through the prequels. I can ignore dialogue and just take in the worlds he’s created. In this trilogy we’re bouncing around so much there’s no time to feel immersed.&&Exactly. I actually liked the prequels. Yes they had issues with bad dialogue and dated CGI (though at the time, the CGI was amazing), but wow, planets like Naboo, Mustafar, Kashyyk, Geonosis, Kamino. All had this sense of wonder. The midichlorians, though ridiculous, added to the world order, and the political intrigue of the Jedi was interesting to me. In contrast, the sequels pretty much sucked. No new worlds - Canto Blight is not much different nor was Crait either really different. It just all seems the same trodden material.&&The books reasoning still doesn't make much sense to me. Who in their right mind would fully demilitarize *AND* cancel their entire intelligence agency knowing there was a militant faction with a chip on their shoulder festering in the Outer Rim? At the very least you would be keeping tabs on them and sure as hell should have been able to track the flow of resources necessary to arm an entire planet into a superweapon with hyperspace engines.

I also can't see the entire galaxy being a homogenous voice on disarmament. Can you really see the Corellians agreeing to keeping no defensive fleet, for example? The Bothans not being interested in keeping tabs on the Imperial remnant? Etc.&&it might be if you basically killed all the leadership at once and swooped in. The problem is they dont show or explain very well that is kind of what happened&&> Was blowing up four planets in TFA all it took to conquer the galaxy?

It seems the new canon made blowing up the DSII all it took to conquer the galaxy, so at least that's consistent. But blowing up StarKiller Base should have been a huge blow to the FO, and instead they come back days later with a huge fleet.&&If they had found something like the Star Forge from Kotor it would make more sense and they would have a nice big menacing base to destroy instead of a new death star&&I think I read the actual explanation is that, plus the republic demilitarized themself because reasons, and decided the FO probably wasn't an issue.


So it's basically agressively illogical.&&Yeah but that doesn't fit with the simple ""good faction, bad faction"" dynamic that Disney obviously wants to keep from the original trilogy.&&It's a little more complex than that post.  The New Republic and the Empire sign a treaty after the Battle of Jakku.  The Empire has very little territory and is required to demilitarize (which they do).  Eventually they collapse complete.  However, prior to this, a bunch of Imperials jump to the Unknown Regions as part of a plan to rebuild the Empire.  The Republic is not aware of this.  At the same time the Republic demilitarizes so as not to become another Empire (very similar to the Republic before the Clone Wars).

The Republic becomes aware of the First Order about 6 years prior to TFA.  The Republic refuses to fight to intercede on their territory.  As such they are basically in a cold war... however the Republic has no idea about the military capacity of the FO.  Leia starts a proxy war against the FO as the Resistance with the under the table support of several senators.  This goes on until TFA and even the Resistance does not fully understand the FO's military capability.  Then TFA happens and shit gets real.  Hope that helps.&&JJ wanted to make a movie that was essentially A New Hope, but with new characters. He couldn't use the empire and the rebellion because presumably the empire was on the ropes after the battle of endor. He definitely couldn't use the canon from the EU it would suck if the 99% of movie audience who'd never read an EU novel had to catch up with hundreds of books just to understand the movies. 

He took the lazy option of just renaming the Empire ""the first order,"" and renaming the rebels ""the resistance."" 

That way his movie could have the same basic story dynamics of A New Hope, and not really invent anything new or add much to the franchise.&&Picture her through out the movie moving small objects. So that we know she can use the force. Her cane, a report, the button on the door. Leading us to believe she's got it but is kind of weak.

Then in that scene she sees the missiles coming and grabs Ackbar or someone else and rips up the deck to shield them and then pulls herself through the wall she's against with the force like a beast, saving her and one other person and then faints from exertion showing that using a huge amount of force is taxing.

Makes what happened to Luke more reasonable.&&Dude that's way better. It would have been an ""oh shit!"" moment. Instead we got, um wtf&&And then having her pilot the cruiser into Ren's lead ship. Would have been an awesome way to go.&&Someone called it the ""Mary Poppins"" scene, thought that was apt. &&The scene between Finn and Rose at the end was so awkward that quite a few people in my screening burst out laughing &&So true. Perfect summary of how I felt about this movie. To me,  it was one weird,  illogical random slap in the face.  &&Watching the movie definitely felt like a fever dream &&""It's a trap... FOR YOU!"" *hypersmash*&&Thanks for the comparison to guardians of the Galaxy, that totally makes sense as to what the director was going for. Shame he had to drag the star wars franchise through that shitty vision.&&As the transports are getting blown up one by one there was barely any tension because it felt obvious that the hero characters weren't in any real danger BUT it should have been an emotionally devastating moment&&It gets worse when you realise that what she did is basically [the only reason Luke had to step in and die](#spoiler)&&When Rose said that, I thought, ""that is exactly what he was doing!

George Lucas was obviously the one to do it before, and we got the OT when his bad ideas were filtered and the good refined and the PT when they weren't, but even in the PT they still had a cohesive narrative and tone.

If Kennedy's not doing it, they need to get somebody on it ASAP, not just for the sake of the main movies but for all the spinoff material and that new trilogy.&&It's bizzare really when you consider they've had so much success with the MCU and theyve been smart to have an over all plan for the future of the series. It's really bizzare they would start a new star wars trilogy without having a plan.&&I hear Kennedy's name get thrown around a lot.

That was my impression as well. That he seems to be able to sense intent, but not actually read people's minds. And from that standpoint, what he senses [kind of fits with the entire idea of Sith killing their masters.](#spoiler)

Things like that and [Rey's parents being nobodies](#spoiler) that a lot of the media seems to be claiming is making people mad I don't have a problem with, and it makes me wonder if the media is really honestly portraying the criticism of the movie.&&Seriously. In TFA when starkiller base blew up the capitol I was like “DID THEY JUST DESTROY CORUSCANT?!” Nope, they destroyed “Hosnian Prime” which I had to find the name of from the Star Wars wiki.

Plus we see in The Force Awakens on Jakku that the New Republic defeated The Empire in a major battle before the movie started so they must have hundreds of ships somewhere.&&It's Disney in 2017. 

There's no point to any of this. They paid out the ass for the rights of Star Wars so by god they will pump out as many movies as they can as fast a second possible to recoup that investment.

It wouldn't have been any more confusing to the general movie audience if they started after the last EU novel, where the stage was set for the oldies to pass the torch and the next generation to take over, a new trilogy was even planned for that time slot which could have easily become the sequel trilogy.

Instead we get a situation where both the general audience and the fans are confused. &&Preach.&&Rian Johnson is the sole credited writer for this film. &&Spoilers: [More like Superman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKNPG9v16Y) This is an actual gif from the film.&&I've seen it called ""Carrie Poppins""&&Even Fin looked confused in that scene.&&I feel Rose was a mistake in her entirety.&&It took too long.

He *could* have been amazing as an ex-Storm Trooper who got sick of the killing and had to be convinced to fight for the rebels, but instead they make him an ex-sanitation worker who defected after his very first battle. That guy who marked his helmet with blood wasn't even his friend or anything, it was just some random trooper.

So his character gets to be this morally clear guy who just has to overcome cowardice, which does nothing to add depth to the lives of stormtroopers or give him any interesting internal demons to grapple with (gee, I wonder what his character arc will be: stay a coward or eventually stop being a coward?) or make anything meaningful out of the shouts of ""Traitor!"" that keep getting thrown at him, as if handing your janitor a gun and having him run away is some deep betrayal.&&Rose lmao what a terrible character &&Narnia x Pacific Rim x Taken ""I will find you and your Kaiju and when I do I will put you back in the wardrobe""&&So...

&&Well if it wasn't for them, the rebels would have been able to sneak off the ship to new hoth without getting blown out of the sky.&&They’ve put a cantina aspect into all the newer movies. I’d like them to put in some planets where 80% of the population isn’t humans again. If there’s one thing the prequels did well it’s making the galaxy feel huge as there were plenty of distinctive planets with a dominant race. 

In all the new ones it seems humans are the most populous with a few other random species spotting the rest of it all.&&We already got that in TFA with Maz's haberdashery. It was a pretty obvious callback, and way better than the casino.&&> If Kennedy's not doing it, they need to get somebody on it ASAP, not just for the sake of the main movies but for all the spinoff material and that new trilogy.
> 

I don't know anything when it comes to Disney or how this stuff gets made, but there's a lot of shit that's happened under Kennedy's watch:

- Michael Ardnt's script was completely rewritten by JJ Abrams. There was some drama about delaying the film from May to December 15 too IIRC

- Josh Trank was fired

- Colin Trevorrow was fired

- Lord and Miller were fired, and it sounds like Ron Howard basically had to refilm most of the movie. By all accounts this Han Solo movie is going to be dead on arrival but I'll reserve judgement once I've seen it...

- A lot of behind the scenes drama about reshoots with Rogue One, which really shows in the first third of the movie. It sounds like some good calls were made by Disney here and Gareth Edwards has said nothing but positive things...but who knows.

- Episode 8 seemed to be the most controversial-free film, so much so that Johnson was given the green light for a new trilogy before Episode 8 had even premiered. But now there's huge backlash online and the box office seems to be falling *very slightly* below expectations. 

Is there something that they're just not getting right? All of the new Star Wars films have been wildly successful, but still...
&&Exactly. Star Wars is going to quickly become a clusterfuck of ideas with no cohesion or consistency between its films or other media if things keep going this way. Someone with a complete vision of the universe needs to take control, because she really is starting to seem unfit for it.&&I think the worst part was hearing that Lucas had basically given them his vision for the trilogy and they didn't use it. 


EDIT:  I haven't seen anything with what his idea was for this new trilogy.  I'm not saying that we do a straight prequels where Lucas is in charge, but rather gave the vision for how the trilogy should play out.  I'm happy enough for how just the story of 1-6 is.  I'd like to see Lucas's story with Disney making it a decent trilogy.     &&Don’t give Disney too much credit. The MCU has a plan because they took the source material from the comics which laid the ground work for them already. Star Wars doesn’t especially since they trashed the EU and thus it’s fucked. &&MCU was directed by Marvel. Disney bought them and said keep doing what you're doing. It sounds like Disney was more hands-on with Star Wars since they didn't buy a working machine but inherited a Lucasian mess. &&I think the Sony email leaks proved once and for all that movie studio execs aren’t exactly a brain trust and a lot of success in anything is in spite of them...&&Unfortunately, that's how industry works. New successes - like MCU or SW original trilogy - have to be managed well or they never become successes.

Sequels, eh. Disney thought some and then hired Kathleen. She doesn't really measure up to the task, but then who does.&&She basically has George Lucas' old job. She has creative control over the entirety of Star Wars.&&Consider her the Kevin Feige of Star Wars instead of Marvel. Big difference (and issue) is that she's no Kevin Feige. &&From the very first introduction to him, I couldn't help but imagine the pitch for him in the writing room was something like

""Okay, so picture this: the new big bad guy? He kinda looks like a snake a little bit, like Voldemort but not quite as reptilian. Totally evil. We'll call him Snake.""

""Snake? Doesn't that seem kind of... on the nose?"" 

*the writers chuckle, patting themselves on the back mentally for understanding such a sophisticated, nuanced joke* 

""You're right, it's a bit simple. Let's go with Snoke instead."" 

""That's *perfect*!""



In their defense, at least it wasn't Snek.&&This confuses me way more than it should.

Like how *nobody* stood up and said 'Yo, anyone else think Snoke is a terrible name? Anybody??'&&Wait.....that wasn't Coruscant?!?&&Hosnian Prime being destroyed was a very disappointing scene too. It was the first time the planet had made an appearance in the film, we did not know any of the characters on the planet, and we did not know the importance of the planet. What were we supposed to feel about it? Were we even told its name in the film? There was no emotional connection with any aspect of Hosnian Prime, until further information about it came out later in other material. Contrasted with Alderaan, we are told that it is Leia's home planet, and we see her beg for it to be saved. Even though we know very little of Alderaan, there is still that connection being made with the viewer that makes Alderaan's destruction more impactful than Hosnian Prime ever will be.&&>I feel like something's missing.

...George Lucas...&&Something like a coherent plot and engaging characters?&&> worlds in the prequels and the OT actually felt like worlds. Worlds in the sequels feel like ""locations""

Fuck.

You're right.&&> worlds in the prequels and the OT actually felt like worlds.

That and the prequels didn't just try to erase canon to have their way. Kashyyyk actually tried to look decently like what we were told it looked like in the EU. It did a bit of a twist by showing a shoreline but the whole ""covered in giant forests"" was actually preserved and make full on screen canon.&&True but the new republic didnt have an army. Like I said they did a shit job explaining things&&Wait... I genuinely can't tell if this is parody or not. Is that actually what t is meant to have happened?&&You can cram a justification in there, but it doesn't make it make any more sense&&Exactly. First we got the prequels; which while a great story had terrible implementation. Now we have the sequels, and while the movies themselves are well done the story they are supposed to tell is terrible. 



It's like poetry.&&Seems like they have no military. &&Not to mention so far the stuff in the EU is/was so much cooler and more interesting than anything they've managed to come up with since EU was scrapped. I know at least a few people who were die-hard starwas fans that now pretty much hate starwars.&&Didn’t he also get approved to write another trilogy shortly before the release of this movie as well?&&The way I imagined it in my head it was pretty bad but now that I've actually seen it, it's even worse.&&Spoilers: This edit of that scene amused me.

https://webmshare.com/play/MyYZb&&What the absolute fuck did I just watch?&&WTF&&The single worst scene in any star wars ever&&😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌👌&&omg this is so hilarious in the worst way. &&What a story Mark.&&How is it possible for Tommy and Anakin to have better chemistry in that scene than Anakin ever had with Padme?&&Oh they toootally referred back to him being a stormtrooper, when they had the detailed schematics of Snoke's Capital ship for planning their heist! It was probably in his back pocket when he defected!&&This would have been amazing. You could even take it further and make some people in the resistance hate him for the people he's killed and not necessarily trust his change of sides. 

I would have loved to see a character trying to do the right thing to redeem himself and have our ""good guys"" hate him for it. Would have made his relationship with Poe and Finn way more deep if they were one of the only few that trusted him. 

Like I get that he tried to destroy the Death Star v3, but there has to be some sort of system to make sure defectors aren't just double agents, right&&And somehow he was able to hold his own against chrome dome in TLJ and Kylo in TFA. I don’t care that Kylo was hurt and his mind was clouded. He should have been able to manhandle a storm trooper janitor with two hands tied behind his back.&&No Poes needed at all. Just automate/remote pilot one X-wing to hyperspace-ram each destroyer and you're done.&&They went from Y-Wings to Space B-52's, it's literally the dumbest technological.advance in history. They went from cruise missiles to WWII bombers&&Like they’re not chipped already. &&Well, it is in line with the quality of thinking that involved her preventing Finn's suicide play into the Death Star cannon.  Because a high-speed crash into the object of your affection is better than having him sacrifice himself, even if the result of that is the certain death of the Rebellion.&&Sssssh, stop trying to explain the movie. We all know how stupid it was and how unnecessary and ridiculous the character of Rose was, is and ever will be. So many contrived plot points. And it's just on endless repeat. How many times have the Rebels by now infiltrated a highly secured Imperial facility or ship? One might think they'd up their security at some point. They're literally infiltrating THE most heavily secured ship in the galaxy...with 3 people! They approach it, board it, leave their ship, grab themselves uniforms, saunter through the ship, stand around aimlessly, while some guy works on THE most secure panel to THE most important device on the ship to keep tracking the Rebel fleet - and they do ALL of that undetected, and what gets them? A fucking astro mech, who gets suspicious?! By then there should have been dozens of security checks, camera feeds, challengey why they're in this area, etc. You can't just keep doing the same nonsense time and again. In the original trilogy it was at least somewhat believable if I remember correctly.&&'big net'

dude, they just gonna push a button and shock those space horses until they come back to where they've learned their food is.&&Because Animal Activist Agenda. Screw logic, right?&&and those kids that helped the space stallions escape are gonna get a paddlin', you can be sure of that.&&Seriously, it is already established that they have planet wide life form sensors. They are not going to have a issue tracking some oversize cat horses.&&You shut your mouth! They're all living together on a farm now, and all their youngling friends got to go too. They just romp all day long with the other previously exploited alien species...

In the arms of the angel, dude! &&You're wrong. Rose said it was worth it. /s&&My issue is they literally could've cut out this scene and ANY scene relating to rose and Finn and the end result would either have ended up better/the same for the rebels. And I don't even mean that as an exaggeration. If you cut Finn and Rose out of the movie entirely, Benicio del Toro wouldn't have sold them out and the empire wouldn't have known to aim for the escape pods. But then again, heavy handed theme of ""failure"" throughout the movie means they had to make it as obvious as possible&&Same. I thought the war profiteering theme would come back around  soooooome way but it never made a full circle. Unless I’m forgetting something (I was pretty high)&&According to her [IMDb](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm1848009/filmotype?ref_=m_nm_flmg) her ""former film and TV writer"" credits are an episode of Crossing Jordan and something called 1-800-Missing. That's it. Baffling that they handed her the keys to a billion dollar franchise

Edit: Also ironic that in one of the pictures on the NYT article, she's sitting in front of a painting that says, ""Playing it safe always ends in disaster."" If TFA wasn't playing it safe, idk what is&&Maybe. All it took was a ""scan for stealth"" order for the FO to find the transports. Though considering how much of an incompetent baboon Hux appears to be, I guess they wouldn't have considered that without a tipoff.&&Wait, Maz was running a men's clothing and goods store?&&>      
> 
> Is there something that they're just not getting right? All of the new Star Wars films have been wildly successful, but still...

The question is, if these films weren't called ""Star Wars"" and didn't have Luke/Han/Leia, would anyone have been going to see them in the first place? &&TFA lacked any real heart/effort imho. They just kinda iterated down the list of common Starwars tropes and called it a day. About the only positive thing I have to say about it, is they nailed the original ""feel"" of Starwars again.

Unfortunately, the opening leg of a trilogy the TFA is not: Rather than set the exposition and tone for an arc going forward, it told a laser-focused novella story more suited for one of the ""Starwars Stories"".

TLJ continues the meandering exposition-less trend and leaves us in a position where the first two movies are one really long prologue to an actual movie. Which now I guess is a movie-as-trilogy assuming we get any exposition in the third one.

The other problem is they blew up the EU, yet haven't set the tone for what they want to take its place. And while I haven't read them, its my understanding that the few new books they have released, detail an incredibly naive and unrealistic portrayal of the New Republic that fly in the face of the canon that wasn't blown up with the EU.&&I feel like Dave Filoni is a good fit for that. He was an apprentice to George Lucas and he knows Star Wars inside and out. He could’ve came up with a cohesive vision for the overall trilogy. Maybe not necessarily direct or write, but be the idea man.&&> Star Wars is going to quickly become a clusterfuck of ideas with no cohesion

its already there: The idea is to raise the stakes—can the Resistance/Rebels survive?—but in truth it lowers them; if nothing that happens militarily in these movies matters from one to the next (including the destruction of a huge First Order Death Star . . . er, sorry, Starkiller at the end of The Force Awakens, which seems to have barely set back the Empire/New Order, what was supposed to be an Imperial start-up, not a full-fledged empire), why should we care a whit about the latest imitation of the Battles of Hoth or Yavin or Endor that the Disney nostalgia factory conjures up?

The answer is that we shouldn’t. As Driver and Ridley prove, with their charisma and their spark, there is still interesting drama to be mined from the story of Force-wielders and their various temptations. But when it comes to the political story that’s supposed to explain why the psychodrama of Skywalkers and Solos matters to the whole galaxy, not just to their kith and kin, the new trilogy has completely lost the plot.&&I move for a vote of no confidence in Kathleen Kennedy's leadership.&&Do we have any idea what his idea for the trilogy was?&&Even of they didn't want to use his there are countless novels written about the post ROTJ Star Wars Universe. Surely at least one of them had a quality storyline.&&As a huge star wars fan I was super excited for the new movies. I was expecting Jedi Luke, Thrawn returning from the outer reaches, Soontir Fel.

Then they nuked everything about it I had loved for over 20 years. Now it's proven to be a pale shadow and really after TLJ I don't give a fuck about Star Wars any more.&&Something that she seems to be passing the buck on to the directors. She needs to be the Kevin Feige of Star Wars. &&Not only Star Wars, is all Lucasfilm and the other companies and brands that are Lucasfilm, like Indiana Jones, ILM, THX, Skywalker sound, etc, etc, etc 

I'm glad that people are starting to blame her and stop saying ""Disney this"" or ""Disney that"",  Disney operates like a holding, there are barely no creative control over the products, BUT of course they steer some of the image of the brands. People like Kathleen Kennedy present projects and how they gonna make money out of it. Kennedy and his staff is responsible of how to make a good product that will make money, that's how it works. Disney ""just"" gives money.&&Kevin Feige made this in a cave!  With a box of scraps!&&Nope. Apparently the New Republic’s capitol was Hosnian Prime. You only see it once, it’s hardly ever mentioned again. 

I’m really disappointed with the worldbuilding of this new trilogy. We don’t even KNOW what Coruscant is doing. &&And Obi-Wan is just hit with the enormity of its destruction from far away. We get the emotional impact and live there for a moment. Like, genocide has actual implications in the galaxy.

The new movies never slow down and let the emotions become real--they just run from one Cool Scene to another, and all the character and emotional development seem like obligations the writers want to cast off so that they can get to the next space battle. I will say that Adam Driver in this new one at least did get some of that emotional acting, which is the only reason Kylo Ren's storyline felt at all significant.&&> Hosnian Prime being destroyed was a very disappointing scene too. It was the first time the planet had made an appearance in the film, we did not know any of the characters on the planet, and we did not know the importance of the planet. What were we supposed to feel about it? Were we even told its name in the film? There was no emotional connection with any aspect of Hosnian Prime, until further information about it came out later in other material. Contrasted with Alderaan, we are told that it is Leia's home planet, and we see her beg for it to be saved. Even though we know very little of Alderaan, there is still that connection being made with the viewer that makes Alderaan's destruction more impactful than Hosnian Prime ever will be.

I feel this sentiment is paramount in this new Trilogy. Why is this ship here, why are we fighting, etc. Nope, most additions are just there for the explosions, destruction, or just because. I was disappointed in how they had Holdo with a very good actress only for a cheap plot point. Sure, people could say, look at the novels where Holdo shines. But I'm watching the movie, not reading the novel. Hell, they could've removed Holdo altogether and have her as the leader of the inevitable Rebel reinforcement fleet. Instead have Ackbar end his epic tale with giving one last huzzah as an amazing admiral. But no, instead Holdo was practically a cameo, & Ackbar died like a random no-name extra.&&I think it’s a blend of this and the complete lack of worldbuilding. I don’t care about Poe Dameron. He showed up on screen and I was like “Oh, it’s discount Han Solo.” I don’t care about Captain Phasma. I don’t know enough about Snoke to care about him, and it doesn’t seem like Rian Johnson cares to tell us anything. 

The Empire has been toppled, but the way the movies are, you’d have no idea. They slapped “First Order” on it, but really, there’s no difference. Rebels vs Empire. Again. Except this time, I have no idea about the rest of the galaxy or why I should care. &&[deleted]&&Their small (relative to the Empire) centralized Republic fleet is destroyed, which we see in TFA . However, the New Republic ethos is to encourage member systems to build up their own local system defense forces, allowing them to provide for their own needs and eliminating the need for a large, centrally controlled fleet. This is supposed to bring the New Republic back in line with the ways of the Old Republic, and limit the size of the centralized military to guard against the rise of another Palpatine. So it's to these allies with intact fleets that the Resistance is appealing to in TLJ.

Problem is, without the Republic government to provide any sort of authority, it depends on the goodwill of these systems to basically donate their ships to the Resistance. Which nobody is gonna do, they just saw the First Empire come out of nowhere and oneshot the Senate. So all these systems are terrified, they're keeping their ships at home where they can be used to protect themselves. The Resistance is the only faction who wants to take offensive action against the FO instead of bunkering up, but they have nothing to do it with. 

Cinematically this is told in NONE of the movies which is a damn shame. I read the canon novels because I enjoy Star Wars, but IMO the books shouldn't be required reading in order to understand the movies. So there is a canon lore explanation, but I get why people are quite reasonably pissed about the lack of it in the movies.&&I was face palming  in the theatre when I saw it.&&That's awesome. Would have preferred it to the actual cut tbh.&&Phasma is a whole extra level of ridiculous in [a movie packed with ridiculousness](http://daystareld.com/the-last-jedi-review/). Not only is she useless in both movies, she actively helped the good guys because they had a blaster aimed at her... despite having armor that DEFLECTS LASERS, as we learned in TLJ.

I don't even know how she survived getting thrown into a garbage chute on a planet that exploded soon afterward, but I wouldn't be surprised if she shows up in the 3rd movie just so Fin has someone to beat up again.

&&""shit we lost a bunch of ships that we could have used to literally just turn around and jump it into hyperspace in every fucking battle ever here on out"" ruining star wars battles for eternity, gj director&&Holy shit that was a great scene, I loved the visuals and it made great use of silence. It was awesome except for the fact that it invalidated literally every Star Wars space battle ever. They could have given her a great sacrifice by like making her move the ship in the way of the cannons line of fire or something. But no they had to do this&&dropping bombs....in outer space they gave up 5min into the film&&Finn also managed to drag her all the way back through a mass of enemy troops unscathed.

I wish they both died.&&I still don't really get how her speeder was apparently faster than his to be able to ram him at basically a perpendicular angle to him. If the laser is what was slowing him down, then it would have made sense to enter at the last second and keep your speed.&&Ugh there was also that stupid scene with Chewie and the porgs. He's a 7 foot tall walking carpet full of rage, known for ripping peoples' arms from their sockets when he's upset. It was a pointless scene out of character intended to get a cheap laugh. &&Kinda wanna see the playsets that come out for the kids. Lego casino cat horse racing track. 

Lego casino craps tables. With the fancy aliens. &&It's also established that they are unwilling or unable to use their sensors at times when it would be advantageous to do so. If the first order gets involved, the cat horse could stand in plain sight and Hux would still miss it.&&[They could have evacuated to the Transpo ships sacrificed Laura Dern (or auto pilot) via lightspeed ram in the first half an hour. They could have.kamikazi any of the other ships before they ran out of fuel](#spoiler)&&What's hilarious is there is a stupid fucking line of dialogue during that betrayal scene where the FO officer says, ""We ran a decloaking scan and he was right.""

Why was this not something you were doing THE ENTIRE TIME? Cloaking technology gets introduced and overcome in SW as an afterthought. They're chasing Resistance who are trying escape, you should be scanning in every fashion you have available to you to ensure they don't get away.

The entirety of this movie and it's story points can be summed up by, ""Because the plot needs it.""&&Haha that’s great. No, not really. It’s kind of just there “so that we know”. There’s the kid at the end, I guess.&&It came around for me when the code-cracking dude cut a deal with the Empire and said something along the lines of ""Today they blow you up, and tomorrow you will blow them up."" &&How ironic, by playing it safe they split the very fandom they desired to please.&&Tbf, this is why Disney paid $4b.  Not because they wanted the best content.  They wanted the surest bet.  It's like EA all over again.&&Yeah, I really like everything he's done with rebels.&&I second that, but I think he likes animation to much to give that up.&&Yep, IMO JJ set up an easy movie to make.

    Reeling from the loss of Starkiller Base Kylo Ren flees with 
    the surviving First Order members back to the 
    Unknown Regions to complete his training.
    
    The new republic was dealt a heavy blow with the loss of 
    their capital and senate, however; buoyed by their success 
    General Leia amasses a massive fleet and chases the 
    New Order into the unknown regions.

    Rey has begun to understand how to use the force under 
    the tutelage of Luke Skywalker (as they rush to catch up to Leia).

This was the setup (well the galactic republic didn't have to chase, they got hurt and maybe they just rebuild and shore up defenses), and Rian did none of it, instead he just made it like the previous movie didn't happen or matter.

It would have been much better to have the republic heading into the unknown regions, learning about Snoke, the First Order, what Luke had been up to, and then a trap gets set and the republic forces get decimated and have to flee, leaving the First Order on the front foot.


&&This, so much this. The remnant of the empire got *stronger* after losing its super weapon. The ""Resistance"" is on the ropes for...reasons? I mean we saw a couple planets blow up. Not sure what planets they were. Pretty sure there are a LOT of them in the galaxy and losing 3 won't end a galactic government. Maybe some explanation would help.

Now we see a Resistance fleet that basically says ""we are it"" get blown to pieces. Their big ship and un-named masses (why do we care again?) are all gone. The next movie is going to have them be re-surging though...for reasons. Everything in this ""space epic"" is hand waved away and it makes it so very hard to care about anything. There are no stakes, personal or galactic. It is badly written.&&Now they will elect a new producer, a strong producer.&&Damn, I’ve been seeing a lot of prequel references lately and even some (small) praise for them. Never thought this day would come.&&I announce that I willing to sacrifice my life for the future of star wars&&Now Reddit will elect a new Producer, a strong Producer. One who will not let this tragedy continue.&&Some, and apparently a few of the elements in his episode 7 made it into 8 in a warped way.

Basically, it was going to be about a new generation of Jedi trained by Luke, with 3 of them being the focus, including one girl, Kira (who became Rey), in particular. The bad guys would likely have been imperial remnants, and the good guys would be the New Republic.

That would probably have changed a lot by the time Lucas got to producing it though.

I'm really sad that he's not involved.&&**The big difference between Feige and Kennedy** is that Feige had the rights to a bunch of cool stuff (not the best stuff but good enough) and the freedom to make what he wanted.

Disney's Star Wars strategy was ""Let's pay $4 billion up front for the rights to **ALL THE STUFF** from the old films. Oh. Wait. Now to make our money back we have to shove ALL of that iconic stuff into the new trilogy."" 

And here's the point: to do that, you have to make the trilogy be about Empire 2.0 vs Rebels 2.0.

This is the single most important creative decision in the trilogy, and it was decided for commercial reasons long before any director or writer was involved.

The problem is slightly clearer in TLJ than TFA but it's the same problem in both films. The galactic conflict between the ~~Empire~~ The First Order and the ~~Rebels~~ ~~The Resistance~~ New Rebels^?? is arbitrary nonsensical garbage made up because Disney bought themselves into a box of HAVING to make movies about stormtroopers and star destroyers.

The problems that OP pointed out with TLJ like lack of sense of scale (the entire ""Galactic Resistance"" is first trapped on one ship, then in one room), lack of context for the conflict (Snoke is never explained), plot holes (some rebels just take a break from being chased to death to go do a side mission), all come from the bad setup in TFA.

Everybody agreed to give TFA a pass because the movie was ""palatable"" and ""felt like Star Wars"" but that movie didn't give any emotional urgency to why there had to be more story after the end of ROTJ or any rational explanation of how things went from Rebel victory to total reset back to ANH. 

Those two problems can no longer be papered over especially when this movie makes clear that for ""More Star Wars"" to happen, Luke Skywalker has to be a failure. He brought peace and freedom to the galaxy, for like fifteen minutes.

You could still probably edit TLJ down to a pretty interesting (and very well directed) TV show episode about Rey, Kylo and Luke. But half of Star Wars fans still wouldn't like what the episode did with Luke's character.&&The New Republic's capital actually wasn't fixed - it rotated each year to one of the different planets in the Republic, as an attempt to prevent the accumulation of power in the hands of a few people. At the time of TFA, that planet was Hosnian Prime. 

Again, you would ***never*** know this from just watching the films. Apparently TFA was originally going to flesh this out more, but it got cut. The woman on Hosnian Prime that gets a long close up right before it is blown up was an ambassador sent by Leia to ask for the Republic's help for the Resistance (which is a separate thing than the Republic! Another thing you wouldn't really get just from the films). &&This is a huge issue I found with the sequel trilogy... Where is the world building? The sense of adventure/exploring a universe?? No matter how terrible/good the plot is of the original and the prequels, the world was so fleshed out and ALIVE. &&The new movies allow Han who is ahlf way across the galaxy to see the individual planets blow up with is bare eyes. JJs hasn't got the slightest sense of what scale space is supposed to be. Star Killer base was just ridiculously bad writing.&&It would have raised so many questions but tbh I'm not sure I would have cared compared to the actual thing.&&Phasma's role is to be a nemesis for Finn.

They tried to compete with American natural gas by lowering prices and waiting for the ""trend"" to come to an end. It didn't. They're now starting the process of liberalization with help from the US in order to make sure that their economy doesn't come to a screeching halt when oil dries up. They're diversifying what is offered there.

Answer is in the middle somewhere...&&There is a long running division amongst the Saudi royalty. Those in power have been western educated and had (comparatively) moderate beliefs, while some of the lesser royals have been using religion as a tool to attempt to seize power.

For a long time this has prevented the rulers from being as moderate as they might want because if they do it could be used to overthrow them, unless there is enough public support for the change. To avoid this, they have focused on bringing about attitude changes first - hence the enormous women's university and similar projects. 

It seems like it might be working (fingers heavily crossed!). The rulers have been making bigger and bigger steps recently and if they are feeling confident enough to detain their opposition then perhaps we'll see it accelerate even further.

Or we'll see a religious uprising and it'll all go to sh*t. Good luck to anyone living there.&&New Crown Prince probably. He's young and getting ready for his long reign and for that he's going to need support. And moderates applaud these changes, but who knows what religious nuts will do?

38 years. It began with the [Grand Mosque seizure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_seizure) in 1979.

>Saudi King Khaled, however, did not react to the upheaval by cracking down on religious puritans in general, but by giving the ulama and religious conservatives more power over the next decade. He is thought to have believed that ""the solution to the religious upheaval was simple: more religion.""

Don't wish him the best, he is a war criminal who realizes that their economy cannot be propped up by oil forever so he is trying to show western investors Saudi Arabia is ready for foreign investment. It's still a dictatorship that continues to fund extremist groups and export wahhabism around the world.  

&&He's consolidating power for himself while changing laws like this to keep the people on his side.&&I'm not sure how sustainable his 'reforms' will be. There is no evidence to suggest these reforms are encouraged by a genuine respect for the rule of law. These changes are part of a series of cosmetic changes that are politically motivated. Saudi Arabia's repression of minorities, human rights record and support of terrorism especially in the wake of recent mid-east conflicts is reflective of their Wahhabi values that have no place in the 21st century.&&Kudo's to him for opening Saudi society up.

The Caliphate wasn't just any empire.  From a handful of nomadic tribes it Mohammed lead the Islamic armies it to defeat both the Romans and the Persian empires simultaneously, and grew to span from the Atlantic to India in less than 150 years. 

This history is a core value for people living in Saudi Arabia.  Regaining that historic power is very attractive.  Efforts to modernize Saudi Arabia and make it just like the Western nations that have dwarfed it, were violently resisted.   These feelings of restoration drive Saudi millionaires to spread Islam throughout the west, fund ISIS, and generally be dick heads at home.&&Purely “haram” and “distractions” causes, man.

I went there one time on Eid, it was HORRIBLE..

Shops close (or forced to close) on intervals because of prayer times... So you had around 2/2.5 hours each time to visit a shop you want, and you should hope that you reach it before prayer is set, people from the “Hay’aa” will come to you with a policeman and tell you to go pray, and I dare you to say “later”...

Places like KFC have lines for women and children, and lines for men.. We just stayed in the hotel and ordered room service.

So, imagine that, but a 2/2.5 hour movie with no interruptions. I wouldn’t be shocked if they have “prayer breaks” in the middle of the movie...&&They ALWAYS leave early, when the gun fights and car chases end, you see about 30 of them get up and leave.

Full grown adults in their 20s and 30s pull middleschool tactics like kicking chairs, throwing popcorn/napkins, touch your head with their bare feet and laugh about it with their friends. When they get caught, they instantly switch on their adult mode like ""Oh. So sorry, sir. Please xcuse me. Accident."". Then go back to making fun of you. For some reason they assume anyone not visibly Arab doesn't speak the language.


It all comes down to them knowing they're above the law. The legal system is corrupt as fuck. Natives can fuck with someone, start a fist fight, and lie and get away with it while you get charged, lose your job, maybe jailed for 6 months, then deported. A system like that is just inviting people to never mature and treat expats (~80% of the population in KSA and UAE) respectfully.

(or wherever he was from)&&I'd like to clarify a misunderstanding about saudi arabia and radical islam which is actually called Wahhabism. 

  Wahhabism (strict version of orthodox islam) did not begin 38 years ago but was founded in the early 1700's by a religious leader named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He was living in a time when certain forbidden acts such as praying to saints, worshiping idols, were considered acceptable within society. Abd al-Wahhab being the fundamentalist that he was, was completely against anything other than the Koran (word of god) and the Hadiths (sayings of the Prophet). So he made a religious-political pact with the leader at that time Muhammad ibn Saud aka Ibn Saud patriarch of present day Saudi dynasty, who was the Emir of Diriyah (later becoming Saudi Arabia) that he as a ulema (scholar of the religion) would legislate the ummah (muslim community) while Ibn Saud would handle the day to day politics needed from a leader.  He helped him consolidate his territory and the Ibn Saud would create alliances with his family members where power would be shared, which is how they have ruled since minus the new crown prince who has consolidated power. That agreement has for the most part been abided by ever since.

 What happened after the Grand Mosque Seizure was more of a doubling down from the Saudis rather than implementing anything new. Many thought the attacks would give the King and the royal family the opportunity they needed to finally take the domestic power back from the ulama but Khaled much like any saudi royal was smart enough to realize the ramifications of acting against the religious scholars in a country holding the 2 holiest cities in Islam. Plus they've always lived by double standards, regular citizens having to abide by strict laws where it is publicly known that many royals drink, have female entertainment, etc. As long as they kept that part of their lives relatively hidden from the Saudi public the Ulama would pretend it never happened. Hate to break it to you but there wasn't a liberal revolution in Saudi Arabia like there was in Egypt or Iran, that would have taken a secular government which never existed. &&Just wanted to add that while the King was Khaled, it was his successor, Fahd who was basically running the Kingdom. King Khaled was just a mild mannered dude that loved camping in the desert and falconry. He was even once reputed to have told Margaret Thatcher that if she wanted to discuss polcies, she should talk to Fahd, but if she was into Falconry, then he's all ears.

Khaled was old, tired of politics by that time and had bad health. He really didn't want to deal with this shit anymore. Unfortunately, Fahd was a moron.&&Can one stupid king who is called president ruin everything?&&And bisexual atheists like me, but I'm not keeping my hopes up.

3) Both violence and sexuality are OK, it's just movies

This is now the heir taking over and reforming the society.&&We were the ones who fucked Iran as well.&&You want examples? Here are some.

1) Iran. [This is what it looked like](https://imgur.com/gallery/pZAyj) before the US fucked them up. They had a promising democracy. But they didn't suck US (and UK) cock enough, so they enacted a coup, destroyed their democracy and installed a brutal dictator. At some point the people revolted against the shah, leading to the shitty theocracy we have today.

2) Afghanistan. The US was obsessed with fighting against the Soviet Union no matter what, so they ended up supporting (financially and militarily) muslim extremists like the mujaheddin, including Osama Bin Laden himself. Surprise surprise, when you help extremists, they gain power.

3) Iraq. Saddam was a jerk but he was relatively secular. The US destroyed the country and its government, disbanding the entire army. ISIS was born in the US prison camps and thrived because of the power vacuum created by fucking shit up and then leaving.

4) Syria. The US wanted to see the Russia-aligned Assad gone, so a lot of cash was poured into support of rebel groups, often consisting of extremists. A lot of those groups defected to ISIS. And the extreme destabilization of the country again provided fertile grounds for shit like ISIS.

5) Saudi Arabia. It's the primary exporter of extremist ideology across the region (like Wahhabism). But they do suck US cock, so they get endless financial, military and political support. What do you think that leads to?

Of course nothing is as simple as ""X caused Y"", the middle eastern mess is quite complex. But you can't keep destabilizing country after country, while pouring endless financial and military support for shitty people, and then wonder why the region has problems. Saying it's their own fault is like a bully telling you to ""stop hitting yourself"".&&They didn't get bombed backwards, not sure why the guy said that. But they didn't completely do it to themselves either. It's an indefensible position to try and separate US (and other western powers') influence from what's happened and is happening in the Middle East.

From the early carving up of the Middle East into nation-states by the British with no nuanced regard for ethnic/religious differences (and from the very beginning, Western interest in the Middle East was about OIL), to the US-led coup ousting a democratically elected leader in Iran (leading to the revolution that brought in the Ayatollah), to proxy wars being fought in Iraq and Iran by the US and the USSR...well, it's a bit naive to say ""they did it to themselves"" in a way that washes blood off the hands of the US and other powers that objectively, *majorly* influenced events in the region.&&Today? Every day!&&The Disaster Artist movie just came out, so it's on people's minds again. &&Yeah essentially Saudi Arabia needs to get ready to face the rest of the world, in a competitive marketplace/service economy.

This. So many people think oil rich countries don't know that their economies are largely on borrowed time. Oil does run out/becomes too expensive to extract and the world is moving away from petroleum in many aspects of economic activity. Many oil rich countries know this, and vary wildly on how they attempt to deal with this problem. 

I remember a quote by a prominent leader from the UAE who said something along the lines of ""My father rode a camel, I drive a Ford, my sons will drive Ferraris, but my grandson will ride a camel.""&&He took the advice of Wu-Tang Financial.&&With all the sun talk (solar powered conversions and discussions on them), i think this would benefit the middle east considering, ya know, the sun beating down on you like a drunk father on his one year old kid who does bad things on purpose.&&Remember when Saudis drove down the cost of oil to fuck over US fracking?  Well US fracking nover got fucked over and today they are punching holes as fast as ever.

Their plan, called the Neom project, is to diversify from oil and create a manufacturing and tourist hub similar to Dubai on the Red Sea. Funding it will require selling 5% of the shares of Saudi Arabia's oil company, Aramaco.

This most recent oil price fall was an attempt by SA to shake up US production. It failed, simply because we don't rely on our oil industry for economic stability.

Idolatry is strictly against the tenets of islam. Abd-al Wahab just advocated a strictly iconoclastic and puritanical brand of Islam that was condemned as being too extreme even by his father and brother (both also religious scholars). Plus, despite the money and geopolitical influence behind Wahabi Islam today, it is still the minority Sunni sect (even though the Deobandi sub-sect of Hanafi Islam is similarly ""radical""). 

Also, assuming that Islam was monolithic before the 1700s is naive--it still isn't, far from it. Practices varied widely from one part of the Dar-ul Islam (Islamic world) to the other so much so that Ibn-e-Batuta who traveled across the Islamic world in the Middle Ages, commented on the the variance in practices. They were depicting the Prophet in miniatures in Islam in Persia while such depictions were forbidden by Arabian rulers. It's just a ridiculous notion to suggest that until Abd-al Wahab came along, millions of Muslims were praying to idols and switched tracks, when Islam had spread all the way to Indonesia by that point. Just because Saudi Arabia bulldozes the tombs of the Prophet and his family because they think it leads to idolatry doesn't mean their paranoia has ever been warranted.&&Depends on the continent.

Many oil rich countries know this, and vary wildly on how they attempt to deal with this problem.

It's not so much that the oil is running out but instead that the price of oil is now so low. In decades past all Saudi governments based future GDP projections on oil that was $100 a barrel. The past few years has seen that drop to $50 barrel and the days of $100 are never coming back. The writing is on the wall and the math doesn't add up.

The only way to keep pace with growth is for them to open up the country to foreign direct investment and it turns out that many investors don't want to put money into a totalitarian, backwards regime. That's the only reason they're 'liberalizing'. They haven't suddenly found jesus.

By the way to correct your point about the veneration of saints it was considered shirk (association with god) in sunni islam. To use a person or an object as an intermediary between god was taken to be the same as if you were to consider it an equal to god. The logic being why can't you speak to god when you know he can hear you and see you all the time, basically there was no need to take that extra step.

> ""And they worship other than Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, ""These are our intercessors with Allah "" Say, ""Do you inform Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?"" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him"" -

In Pakistan, where I'm from, it's true that some people truly do treat saints as intermediaries but by and large, educated Muslims only go to those shrines to pay respect to people who were instrumental in spreading Islam to the region. Whether that constitutes idolatry or not may be a matter of debate for some (I for one don't think it does) but no way do the Muslims who hold those views consider it to be idolatry. 

From a secular perspective, Wahabiism is similar to evangelical or puritanical movements within Christianity that came about as a response to what people felt was a Catholic Church straying from Christianity. It's one thing if Wahabis believe that that was the case and Abd-al Wahab saved Islam from the brink of idolatry, but one should acknowledge that the rest of the Muslim world doesn't necessarily agree with that logic. At some point all religion boils down to the other sect is wrong and my sect is right and to me, outright saying that before Wahabiism, the Muslim world was practicing idolatry, falls in the same category. I don't think it's quite as black and white as that. 

On another note, I think that saying that Wahabiism is responsible for militant Islam is also ignoring the nuances of the situation. The only reason why there's an overlap with Wahabiism and militant Islam is that it was the sect that, for geopolitical reasons, got weaponized oftener and more easily.&&Opening credits, establishing shot, ending credits.&&Not to be confused with the Gothic Castle&&Wahabiism in a nutshell&&Jesus this is horrible...

There is much more obvious shit that gets pushed on reddit.&&I remember seeing all the front page posts. Then I watched the movie with my girlfriend. Both of us thought the movie was alright, but Gal Gadot wasn't a very good actress. She's just a pretty face.

My gf was even making comments about how she's terrible, while we were watching the movie.&&Wonder Woman being the first Superhero movie between MCU and DCU that stars a Female Lead Superhero. I'm not surprised of its or her success either..

You could make a case for Jennifer Lawrence being the first lead female 'superhero/villian' as Mystique in Xman, but I would argue she played support for Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. Plus that cast was more an ensemble compared to WW leading solodolo.&&Haven't heard about this-- did she charge fans for a meetup or something recently?&&Highest-grossing means how much the movies she starred in made not how much she personally earned. &&175 dollar dollar?

Edited to add  links since I'm getting down voted for some reason&&[deleted]&&So close&&She really has got it it all, you wrote&&Most likely not. Looking at his IMDB, he doesn't have much on the cards for 2018 besides the Marvel movies, so anyone in both Black Panther and Infinity War likely has him beat. Ant-Man and Wasp is apparently this year as well, so someone could appear in all 3. I imagine Chris Evans has a scene or 2 in Black Panther. 

Josh Brolin is going to do very well also. Infinity War and Deadpool 2 are out this year. And he's got potential cameos in Black Panther and Ant-Man and Wasp. But without a doubt, Stan Lee wins with cameos in Black Panther, Ant-Man and Wasp, Deadpool 2, Infinity War and X-Men: Dark Phoenix. &&[deleted]&&They've consistently said Avengers 4 is a two-parter.  I imagine Avengers 3 will end on a down note, likely Thanos getting 2-3 of the gems if not all of them, and then we'll have a year build up with more movies, to prep for Avengers 4 when Thanos gets beat down. 

I'm sure they'll be pieces missing to that, likely someone has to actually die, but 3 and 4 have been pretty clear that they're both infinity war.  

Which also means Thanos has two movies to actually get some development.&&Avengers 3 will be a story of defeat and lost. Avengers 4 they will beat Thanos. It's not a surprise why they named those films part 1 and 2 at first. They still gotta do quite a bit of build up before kicking it and there's supposed to be so many battles, including a war. Unless they want a JL type of mess, or a 4 hours movie, they're gonna split it in 2.&&Yeah dude, Warner Bros has consistently terrible CGI. I don't know what labor farm they aren't running properly, but they need to realize Marvel Studios has their CGI down pat.

Regardless of which universes you like better, Warner needs to get their act together on their visual element. It's funny how a visual medium seems to keep failing on the visual part of it.&&I admit I was skeptical with her as WW at first so she didn't bring me to BvS, but she was the best part of the movie and the reason I went to see Wonder Woman. Also why I had any faith in Justice League. 

IMO she's the best thing in the DC movies, by far.&&I'd watch a three hour infomercial selling mayonnaise if Gal Gadot was hosting it. 

She is my all time number one celebrity crush, I can't even tell if you if she a good actress because I can't be unbiased and impartial. It's the accent. And also the everything else. Gal goddamn Gadot. &&Her WW scenes were 💯

Go turn off your X station64, it's time for dinner.&&At Comic-con. It's pretty standard fare for big actors, though.&&This apparently happened at ACE Comic Con. According to [this article:
](https://batman-news.com/2017/12/04/gal-gadot-henry-cavill-autograph-photo-ace-comic-con/)
>The cast will be signing autographs and taking photos with fans, but they won’t be cheap. Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill are each charging $175 for an autograph. Want to take a photo too? That’s another $175. If you’re on a budget, you can just hang out with Cyborg. Ray Fisher is only charging $50 for an autograph and $65 for a photo.

But it's not just Gal and Henry, it seems to be the entire cast of Justice League:

>Here is the pricing info from ACE Comic-Con’s website:

>**AUTOGRAPH PRICING:**
* Gal Gadot – $175.00
* Henry Cavill – $175.00
* Jason Momoa – $80.00
* Ciarán Hinds – $55.00
* Ezra Miller – $60.00
* Ray Fisher – $50.00

They also charge for photos, and this all is apparently a very normal thing for big stars to do at these events. Makes me think though that it's more the actor's managers that organizes people be charged more than the stars themselves to demand to be paid.&&Eh, its nothing new if you're familiar with the convention scene. Pretty standard fare for these types of appearances. I actually expected Gal to charge more or not participate in signings/photo ops.

Usually your typical voice actors/small time comic writers will be there charging between $40 - 
$60 per autograph and same for a photo. But getting any type of A-B list actor/celebrity and the rates go up significantly. And the crappy part is they only take cash so there are plenty of ATMS scattered throughout, haha.

For example, I went to Awesome-Con in D.C. over the summer and Stan Lee was there charging $120 for an autograph/pic (thats for each one) and an extra $20 if you wanted a Certificate of Authenticity for his signature. The lines to see him were still significantly long so I'm not sure about the theory its to ""weed out"" the riff-raff. 

This Spring, for the next Awesome-Con, some of the GotG cast are going to be there and I'm sure the Marvel rates will be in full effect. So to get Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementiff, and Michael Rooker's autographs will probably run right around $600 and double that if you want selfies. lol.&&ALL celebrities do. If they just gave them out they would be mobbed, especially at cons. Pictures and autographs are expensive, but it helps turn an all day event into a few hours of pictures and signatures. If it was free she would never get a break. I saw Sam Jones charging 50 bucks at SVCC&&> We didn’t even get the fucking Christmas bonus.

The real tragedy.&&When will they reboot spiderman again?&&Kind of. But it started with like 1 spidreman every 2 years, a hulk movie, and a few batmans over the course of like 5 years. Not thor, justice league, Spider-Man reboot #3, wonder woman all in the same year&&Lol I love The Rock, ngl. I don't care how cheesy he is.  &&With the likes of Christian Bale, Michael Fassbender, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, etc... filling out roles in superhero movies, yeah, there's a high degree of acting ability on display.

Gal Gadot has a pretty face. That's it. Her acting is mediocre at best. Won't stop the masses from fawning over her, though. &&Agreed.&&Of the $1.4 billion? I can live with that much money. &&Or what if that actress was in a cheesy [interactive phone app before Star Wars?] (https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/lifesaver-mobile/id633999639) 

Edit: Adding the interactive [YT video for those w/o iPhones] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csl6Ll2hOt0)&&*BUT* you're making ""unknown new actress alongside Mark, Carrie, and Harrison"" money.  I'd still take that money, but didn't Harrison get something like 50 million to Daisy/John/Oscar's 300k?&&According to Jimmy Fallon's interview with Daisy Ridley last year (am on mobile will add link soon) Star Wars was her first official film, never did any indie films before that.&&I'm shocked too.

He really deserves the title.&&Why didn't people see blade runner ffs?&&*grabs pitchfork* Are we bashing the DCEU? Whew, thought I missed it.&&The film broke even.  It wasn't an economic success or failure.

Valerian was the largest failure this year.  It was such a failure that people don't talk about it.  The film had a budget similar to Justice League but only 1/3 the gross.&&This is how Stan Lee is one of the highest grossing actors of all time.&&That link is just baseless speculation. I mean, there was barely any merchandise for the WW movie, and they think a tiny cut of it will put Gal’s income from the movie up to multi-million dollars? When they have no reason to think merchandise was even part of the contract, especially when, as they say, it’s about leverage?

Additionally this article suggests multi seven figure which even if it were credible it’s still way less than $50 million.

And if you are including proceeds from WW2 in that $50 million, well that isn’t that impressive when it’s across movies that stand to make a combined $2000 million in box office alone.

Perhaps you have a better link? Because that one has some pretty weak arguments.

In saying all that few people expected WW to do as well as it did (hence lack of merchandise) and with that in mind $600 000 wan’t unreasonable when the contracts were being drawn up.&&Fair enough,

I hope it's Avengers Infinity War 2: Electric Boogaloo&&Yeh, 4 is Infinity Wars part 2&&WB did Blade Runner 2049 and that had the best effects of the year imo&&[removed]&&Disney doesn't own ILM out right, but they work pretty much side by side on everything the former produces. It's my firm belief they make the difference.

I can't be bothered with CGI that looks like a cartoon. &&[deleted]&&> IMO she's the best thing in the DC movies, by far.

As a casual fan of all the comic book movies, she is certainly the best to look at.&&IMO Christopher Nolan was the best thing to happen to DC movies next to Tim Burton, but I’m going to assume you’re referring to the Justice League movies specifically. &&I'm right there with you.  She is stunning.&&For me it’s Daisy Ridley.

&&Yeah they’re not going to cast some butt ugly actress as Wonderwoman&&And ruin my chances? Hell no.&&Or Supergirl&&Oh shit you are right my bad. How could I forget about Halle Berry.

I feel ashamed. Maybe its because the new era of superheros have been all men though. I know that motivated me to watch Wonder Woman, not only am I a fan of Gal's but a new perspective was refreshing. &&Historical revisionism. That's it.&&Hahahahaha &&Yeah that’s likely more about crowd control than money grabbing.&&Someone else has said it elsewhere here, but it's often more to do with crowd control than actual money making. They found a smart way to do both, so do.

It's probably tied into the comic con itself. &&I enjoy movies. Movies are entertaining and fun. But WTF? I don't get why anyone would do that to be honest.

^(* *some assembly required*)&&Thank god I got here in time, I've missed most of these and the aftermath is always hilarious.&&> Valerian was the largest failure this year.

Wow... I didn't even realize that movie was released yet  and it came out in July. I don't know if that is a PM failure or because of the quality of the movie&&It's pretty rare that I'll start watching a movie and just not finish it. But Valerian did that to me. I just couldn't take the shitty acting and zero chemistry anymore.&&Valerian didn’t cost nearly as much as Justice League because you have to factor in marketing. Which Valerian didn’t spend nearly as much as Justice League in. &&[deleted]&&Exactly and it's why Vin Diesel is the #1 of the year. Sure I'll give him Fast 8 but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2? He said ""I am Groot"". So he gets to claim that entire success? It's such a bullshit metric.&&Don't think he gets top billing though or paid for his appearances.

That's like saying any extras who starred in multiple blockbusters are top grossing.&&Barely any? Not sure where you’ve been looking, but I’ve seen dolls, action figures, play sets, hot wheels, etc. It might not have had as much merchandising as Thor, but it seemed pretty close. &&Yeah but Villeneuve is almost a god so he had complete control. Once WB execs get into a production's business, they mess it up real good like it's their goal.&&For the record, while ILM can still be contracted for work, they are entirely owned by Lucasfilm and therefore entirely owned by Disney.&&Jason Momoa is pretty easy on the eyes as well.&&I agree entirely. The Batman series by Christopher Nolan were superb. Good actors, filming, as well as portraying Batman as he should be portrayed. Not trying to make him something he’s not. (Marvels kid friendly superhero comedies)&&Nolan was the best... And worst thing. He brought Batman back to the big screen in spades. WB took the wrong lessens from his trilogy, though. They saw the gritty movies and though, ""let's do this to everything, starting with Superman."" No. It worked for Batman because it matched the character of Gotham and highlighted every character that existed in those movies. Current DC movies devalue the essence of any character because they're going for the same tone as the Nolan trilogy without the character focus. &&Shirtless kylo ren ftw&&[no](https://kinobody.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/henry-cavill-body.jpg)&&How were you busted? &&Private Internet Access will solve that. &&Gary Busey&&More like there's not that many ugly actresses period, but yeah. &&[deleted]&&Good ol’ supply and demand&&Why not both?&&Almost 200 for an autograph and it's not mostly about money grabbing? &&##Go them, keep the peasants out.

The riff raff shouldn't get Gal Gadots signature with bonus photograph for anything less than $349.98&&Yeah I'm sure it gets even more ridiculous for MCU promotions and RDJ&&I bet you're not allowed to touch them.&&True, I went to Emerald City Comic Con back when it was a lot smaller and all the autograph lines were manageable except for Wil Wheaton who wasn’t charging anything. His line was absolutely insane. &&She deserves it though. She's fantastic as Rey.&&Have you guys seen her audition for the star wars video? She nailed it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.unit9.lifesaver.android.mobile&&Reminds me of Jonah Hill. During Wolf on Wall Street, he took the legal lowest amount you could get as a union actor in that sort of role (only $60,000) because he wanted to be in it that badly. Both due to wanting to work for Scorsese, and for the role itself.

And it paid off for him. He was nominated as best supporting actor at the oscars for it. Between that and moneyball, it lets him have some reputation in more serious movies going forward. Well worth the pay cut.

It was a good pick for the director and producers as well. Definitely a standout role. Hill is very serious about his roles, and it's great to see him succeed, where many comedians don't make the transition. I bet working with top level actors like Pitt and DiCaprio is a great influence for him as well&&Yeah, this is their plan financially speaking: 

Be in a a Star Wars brand movie, take any $ they will give me.  They'd probably work for next to nothing.

Then, since the Star Wars brand will undoubtebtly be successful, leverage your necessity as a character to boost payment on future films.

Same thing Gal did with Wonder Woman.  Took a ""small"" paycheck to get that role, and now had all the bargaining power for the sequel.&&Shit, I would have paid money to have a bit part in Star Wars.  Screw being paid to be in it.  Just being in it is enough.

Just let my character come in for no reason and say ""I have a bad feeling about this"", and then exit stage right, never to be heard from again.  I'd be that random guy in the lore that with no backstory, and people making up stories as to who I was and why I was there.&&Not the smart ones, the smart ones will read the script and decide. Star Wars fandom has killed careers before, and will again. You could argue, if you are already unknown anyway, there is no loss in getting your non-existent career destroyed, but if acting is the only thing you are half-good at..&&$300k is probably the most money she ever earned in her entire life. Let alone having a main role in a fucking STAR WARS movie. I'll pay $30k if they let me have a main role in the franchise. But I'll probably fuck up the franchise.&&Óscar Issac had a lead in a Coen Brothers film under his belt.

John Boyega's biggest work beforehand was Attack The Block, which wasn't the biggest blockbuster.

Daisy was just your standard bit-part actor in British TV.&&He wanted Solo to die because he felt it was right for the character, and would be a huge growth moment. He's stated this in several interviews.&&Bruv 300k is nothing compared to the revenue their faces generate. Disney is making billions of profit from paying them 300k. It *could* turn into Jon prospects for the actors, but don’t give them shit when the Disney executives are making millions.&&> time shifts and British accents.

&&The worst thing about that movie is how good it could have been. The concept and world building is amazing, a ton of fresh/novel sci-fi ideas, and they are all wasted on a lackluster script, and worse acting than most porn movies.&&But then again, an actor's pay also isn't a measure of a film's success.

Terrence Howard was paid more than RDJ for Iron Man, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't his performance that made the film (and the whole MCU after it)...

Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs only had a few minutes of actual screentime but he's also the most memorable thing about it...

Any way you slice it is going to be bullshit to some degree&&To be fair to Vin Diesel, he also did motion capture in the second film (was casted too late into the first film for motion capture). And even though it was kinda a silly gig, he took the voice acting pretty seriously. Even wore stilts to be more in character and took speech lessons in order to properly deliver the line(s) in several languages.

https://youtu.be/zsCJ0JH_XrU&&He has prior experience though for the Iron Giant. I don't think you could get a better actor for that role.&&For Vin Diesel it was only for Fast & Furious and XXX.  His number was $1.6bn gross and $1.2bn of that was F&F&&Normally I'd agree, but fast 8 made 1.2B.

I'm not sure his place on top of the charts is all that bs.&&They didn't count guardians and he was still number 1 lmao&&Needs more robotic spiders &&**Aquaman v Wonder Woman: Dawn of Just Us Two**&&Henry Cavill too&&As a straight male watching Justice League I couldn’t fucking figure out who was more attractive. Jason Mamoa or Gal Gadot. Jason’s got his shirt off the entire time and Gal is wearing this teeny tiny mini skirt. Like come on! dude. Give us a break &&Oh yeah The Dark Knight trilogy wasn't kid friendly at all, it was an adult only capekino.&&I think it’s also kinda what sent the DCU spiraling out of control. They tried to keep it dark and gritty, but none of the writers (or Zach Snyder I guess) could do it as well as Nolan. Then they kept that tone through each movie and it’s just gotten old and kinda shitty.&&Does anyone think there would ever be a possibility of seeing Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan work on a Batman movie where CB is Batman again? Honestly... No offense to Ben Affleck, but I just don't personally enjoy his Batman, I know that many mocked bales voice, but (given I'm a young fan that grew up with Van Kilmer, Clooney, and Keaton's Batman's) to me it is just the most enjoyable performance.&&Mr W I D E&&We're all winners in this comment thread.&&He busted a nut. &&They send a letter out. Based on other forum responses on this, it seems like the letters don't really matter and ISPs only do it to legally cover themselves from knowingly allowing it to happen.&&[removed]&&Second PIA, fantastic VPN.&&Gary Busey is the most beautiful actress in Hollywood and nobody can convince me otherwise.&&so sarah chalke then?&&Lena dunham&&Barbara Streisand by Duck Sauce popped in my head when I read your comment with Gary Busey as the lyrics &&I wish I didn’t know it existed.&&I imagine if actors didn't charge, they'd be there for hours signing autographs. If there's a fee, it might limit the numbers some. Plus, it's a great way to make a buck at a big time event like Comic-Con. Who knows.&&Well yeah. Do you think they need 200$ an autograph lmao. If it was about money then it would be quite a bit more, because they can charges much as they want. &&Yes. This is how the world works with pretty much everything that is valuable and scarce. In this case, the valuable item happens to be Gal’s time. 

Let’s say there are 100,000 people who want to get a free autograph from Gal. The best (not perfect, but best) way to figure out who the really big fans are is to charge a decent amount of money to meet her. So instead of 100,000 people, you have a more manageable ~300 or so who are really big fans and will get to have a quality experience with her.

Yes, poor people get left out. But poor people *always* get left out of really cool experiences. If you’re going to attack Gal for charging money to meet her, then attack the NFL for charging people lots of money to attend the Super Bowl. It’s the exact same thing. &&Stan Lee was charging 200 at the Portland Comic Con.  The line was still over 2 hours long at its peak.

If they gave the autographs away you'd see people camping out Black Friday style.

&&If you make it cheap then everyone would go&&Payday loans on offer @ the door&&Yeah well maybe she's not allowed to touch me!! HUH DID YOU THIN OF THAT :-)&&Honestly, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley give the best performances of any of the main cast in any star wars movie outside of maybe Ewan McGregor. Say what you want about JJ but he put together a hell of a nucleus for the sequel trilogy.&&I can't imagine anyone else that would be more perfect for the role, so glad that they casted an unknown actress and I think the move has payed off brilliantly.&&Oh yeah. Her casting was spot on. &&Then you get that Comic con/convention circuit money for the rest of your life if anything. And if you wait long enough, you can get cast in the sequel again&&Mileage may vary. The big three new names in the new trilogy are all getting some impressive roles. Meanwhile, Hayden Christensen's filmography is a list of films you have never heard of. The only actors who came out of the prequels well, were actors who were already doing pretty well before the prequels. &&
>Then, since the Star Wars brand will undoubtebtly be successful, **leverage your necessity as a character** to boost  payment on future films.


She undoubtedly signed a contract for the trilogy not just one film.

>Same thing Gal did with Wonder Woman.  **Took a ""small"" paycheck to get that role, and now had all the bargaining power for the sequel.**


I want to clarify Gal Gadots contact was for three films as well (Batman v Superman, Wonder Women, Justice League) not one. &&Ah, the ol' ""do it for the exposure"" scam to get schmucks to work for free.

It can work in Hollywood (we never hear of the ones that don't work out) but way too many assholes try to get free labor in every other field and it never works out for the good of the worker, only the one getting work done for free.

Blame Superman for not being happy even though 5 years ago Reddit was complaining Superman was too much of a boyscout.

Blame Superman for blowing up cities even though he does that in every medium he is in.

Batman can't kill people even though the Tim Burton Films had Batman drop someone in a sewer with a grenade also burn someone with the Batmobile exhaust. 

CGI monsters even though the new Avengers will have a CGI monster. 

Shit on anything Zack Snyder has created. 

&&I'll give you a topic: Zack Snyder..... and... GO!&&Howdy&&I found it pretty funny that one of the only things I enjoyed in that film was Rihanna who I am absolutely not a fan of. &&I did Netflix DVD. For ""free"", it was ok. LPT: Get a little tipsy when you think the movie might be bad. It helps. A lot.&&Hopkins got 16 minutes of screen time and 1 academy award for Silence of the Lambs. &&You're hired.&&Hopefully it doesnt turn into flashpoint paradox.&&I’m not mad at that at all&&Something like [this](https://youtu.be/LxsBlWp-MDQ)&&Watchmen and 300 were both dark movies as well and they were great imo, but keeping that tone for the entire universe at first is what killed it. Suicide Squad was the worst movie I've ever seen. &&What I wouldn't give to have that woman sit on my face.

&&Lol I've gotten literally dozens of those letters over the years. fuck Comcast&&They turned off my service for about 20 minutes when they ""caught"" me. 
&&Id fuck her even before the motorcycle crash.  &&Movies?&&They already are there for hours even with the fee&&Or she could just sign autographs for a set period of time, and on a first come first serve basis.

There. Problem solved without resorting to absurd prices. &&Ok I guess you've never heard of Chewbacca&&Ian McDiarmid gave a stellar performance as Sheev Palpatine. &&Ewan McGregor perfectly captured what Kenobi was and what he was supposed to be while also bringing new life and depth to the character. He did this in three movies not specifically centered on his character where he was surrounded by relatively subpar directing and acting.

The quintessential Jedi of the old Republic as well as a complex and believable person; Ewan McGregor’s Obi-wan is my favorite Star Wars character and in my opinion the most impressive performance of the franchise to date. Those others are good though.&&Hamill in TLJ yo.&&I can't agree with that at all. Alec Guiness, Ian Mcdiarmid and Harrison Ford at their best outperform those two&&I think Harrison was better in the OT than Daisy. He played the charming rogue who’s also somewhat noble perfectly. Daisy seems like she’s reading from cue cards most of the time to me. For some reason i think her acting was better in TFA than TLJ. Ewan’s definitely the undisputed king though imo.&&Is it just me or does Daisy Ridley come off flat in a lot of her lines at least in The Last Jedi?   There are scenes that she's stunning but there's are a lot of scenes (particularly with Luke) where the line reading is weak as hell. 

That being said. Ford and Darth Vader (up to you if you want to credit James Earl Jones or David Prowse for it) and.. god help me because I might have to remember something from the prequels but Ewan McGregor also did a fantastic job that I think these two don't live up to quite yet.

I think Driver's flaw is his character isn't well defined, he throws little tantrums that seem out of place, and that's more on the director/writer than him, but it makes it hard to really appreciate him when he does act because overall his acting isn't as demanding as I see people make it out to be.&&i'll disagree entirely about Daisy. I find her performance flat and boring. Adam Driver i completely agree with though. &&I couldn't disagree more, but I do generally like Daisy and Adam in their roles. It's just that their roles aren't very good (that goes much more for Daisy). Kylo is an interesting character but TLJ has put him in a weird position of being the big bad, but not commanding much respect (a bit too flawed to be scary or believable as a commanding presence).&&I have to disagree, the entire cast of Rogue One says hi.&&> Say what you want about JJ but he put together a hell of a nucleus for the sequel trilogy.

Damn I mean the cast is great, but what about *undermining the entire plot of the original trilogy just for the sake of soft-rebooting the franchise*. To me, that's the nucleus of the sequel trilogy and it's broken beyond belief.&&> I can't imagine anyone else that would be more perfect for the role

But isn't that mostly because you only know the role as played by the one person? Which by definition has shaped your opinion of it and who could play it...&&By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.&&But other than Hayden most were established actors. Ewan, Sam Jackson, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, etc&&She negotiated for way more money on the wonder woman sequel because they didn't lock her into a contract for more then one. 

Like you said they confirmed her for batman v, wonder woman, and justice league. &&Even in Hollywood, something like Star Wars is really the only way it even works with any degree of reliability. &&It'll look good on your resume!&&Ah, the Prince Harry/William trick&&Said James Bond.&&The older actor left the industry out of choice IIRC. Has a farm he runs or something&&A lot of voice actors really get around though. Guys like Steve blum.&&How many more times are they going to let him crash his plane before they take away his license or at least re-evaluate it? &&Free review model. We don't call it paid endorsement here.&&Dude those are in limited supply. I'd keep it under wraps if I were you, don't want people nabbing it.&&And watch out when things drop into slow motion. If you're not the one looking cool, it means you're about to get slammed.&&I just hate how so many of the dcu movies have no ""setting"", everything goes down in some dark alley, basement, factory, roof.  then its in the midst of rubble.

Not sure why this bothers me...  but it does.&&*Why did you say that name?!*&&They took your job! &&Because even with her stale performances she is still leagues beyond the two wooden boards of the lead roles.&&[deleted]&&Judi Dench: Hold my beer.&&Yeah and because of his role he got more credit and praised than anyone else in that film. &&Suicide Squad was a horrific patchwork.  They made two movies, one super dark and gritty and the other was more in line in tone with Guardians of the Galaxy.  Gave it to test audiences and then took all the bits audiences liked from both movies and edited them both together.  Atrocious.&&If she did that you'd have people lining up for hours on end before she starts signing, and that would be a space problem for many convention venues. I agree it's a shame they charge that much but I imagine the convention also determines a lot of the price.&&[deleted]&&Umm R2-D2!? Do you even speak binary??&&Not everyone follows hip hop.&&*Ian McDiarmid gave a stellar performance as the Senate.*
&&it's really no surprise. McGregor is a very talented and well seasoned actor.&&Ewan is an excellent actor, but I disagree completely. He is neither complex nor believable, and his dialogue is wooden as fuck in these movies. But his over-the-top ham-and-cheese performance—especially in III when Lucas stopped giving a fuck—is a delight to watch.&&I mean, pretty much every major character who wasn't named ""Rose"" gave a good performance.

But Sergeant Salty definitely takes the cake. A performance to define a generation!&&nah, I felt like Hamill just played Hamill instead of Luke.&&Adam Driver is easily the best performance in the series. Kylo Ren is hands down the most realized and three dimensional character in 9 movies.

I love prequel Kenobi, but Kylo is the benchmark now. It’s a shame we can’t get a movie with both. &&Completely disagree on Daisy. Having said that Im willing to entertain Harrison Ford being up there. I guess the material Adam and Daisy have make them stand out more but Hamill is great, its just more subtle.&&Daisy was definitely way more convincing in TFA.&&It took me a while to warm up to Daisy because every time she smiles I see Jake Lloyds face and it freaks me out. Her acting seems cold and wooden.  &&Especially if you compare her to Felicity Jones, who did a fantastic job in Rogue One, and probably should have been cast as Rey instead

&&I’m glad somebody isn’t on the loopy juice. She’s not had much in the way of other roles and it shows. She’s incredibly wooden. &&It's almost like that's the point. 

He's flawed. &&> not commanding much respect

I don't know if I agree. Hux seems to be the one that get's no respect. (See Captain of that Dreadnought for an example)... They fear Kylo sure but I never seen any one show him any disrespect. &&THERE'S NO OTHER WOLVERINE THAN HUGH JACKMAN!!!&&That is true, though there is also Jake Lloyd. Natalie Portman also wasn't exactly established. As far as I can see, Phantom Menace was her first huge role, though not her first movie. Even the OT cast had a couple of acting credits beforehand, especially Harrison Ford. &&Yes but that was because the studio didn’t have any faith in Wonder Woman. They didn’t expect it’d do well enough to justify a sequel. 

Star Wars? I’m sure they’re locking people into multi-film deals. Disney would rather lose actors than pay them more, they’ve shown that in their Marvel films. &&That is the same thing that happened with rdj for marvel. DC probably didn't have much confidence in wonder woman&&What?&&Is it a moisture farm?&&He has or had a farm but no he still wants to work he's just not a draw for crowds. He's doing nick cage level work now. &&Theyve definitely reevaluated it.  For the most part he's been found not at fault in these events,  aside from the taxiway landing.   It is a concerning pattern though. &&Now use your free pitchfork to take the rest of the pitchforks.&&Thats the beauty of pitchforks. Someone tries to steal it, they have to approach. Thats when I stab them with the fork they are trying to steal&&Most importantly, have fun.&&Probably because most of the DCU is just made up locals. Metropolis, Gotham, Central City, Jump City. &&:(&&That movie pretty much singlehandedly sank Peter Berg's career.&&Anthony Hopkins won for best leading actor, though, and judi Dench won for a supporting role. 16 minutes of screen time and being considered a lead character is impressive. &&To be fair, it's Judi Dench. She's not about to trust you with her beer, she'd neck it instead.&&The worst part is that it changes the type of person lining up. No fee equals a bunch of young women and kids, $200 fee equals a bunch of adults.&&I like how they are progressively giving less of a fuck about translating what he says.&&You haven't seen Shakespeare until you've seen it with an all-Wookiee cast.&&When he said ""aggghhhh"" I broke down.... It was just too much!&&- George Lucas, after filming the holiday special&&*Beeps in R2D2*&&I would really like to see what he says in subtitles.
&&Samuel L Jackson gives a stellar performance as Not Yet&&He must be Frank your majesty&&I thought his name was “treason, then?”&&>But Sergeant Salty definitely takes the cake.

Pretty much the one thing aside from Adam Driver's physique that's keeping /r/sequelmemes in business.&&Rose is a Hayden Christiansen issue. She can act, some of the moments and facial expressions and timings she had to do are very tough. It was just shittily written and a character that people cringed every time she had to be on scream because she was SO extra.&&>I mean, pretty much every major character who wasn't named ""Rose"" gave a good performance.

I don't think that's fair I thought her performance was just as great honestly. The lines she had to deliver are something else entirely 

&&Curious what your problem with Rose's performance was. I doubted the sudden love art the end but that's a writing issue&&I felt she played her character well actually. A bit like a crazy fan girl put into a star wars movie and that meshed with her characters motivations. Even with her weird kiss I see it as intentionally weird, as a commentary on the common trope of the hero kissing the girl after saving her. Finn is understandably confused but the point is that it's odd that in other movies it would almost be a given that the hero would kiss the girl. Their plot line was the weakest but overall it did sirt if wirk in it's own way&&When rose wakes up ,kisses fin, then faints is the worst scene in the entire movie.(magic space flight leia was super cringe too.) Then fin magically drags her half a mile on foot, somehow outpacing a fleet of walkers... wtf

Edit: don’t forget the girl kicking the ladder in the intro to get the bomb drop remote down although the film gave no indication that she was injured and couldn’t just climb back up. THEN the fucking remote falls past her body with her arms at her side and a millisecond later she’s reached out and caught it... So many stupid immersion breaking decisions in an otherwise awesome movie. &&Adam Driver crushed any acting competition in the movie, even Hamill. Kylo steals every scene he's in. I'd watch him eat a sandwich and be completely enthralled.&&He played a very different character, sure, but he was supposed to be. I don't think there's any way of playing the part in TLJ as written like Luke from the original trilogy.&&Agreed, Kylo is what Anakin should've been.&&A Star Wars time travel movie is the answer.

They'd have to go back to the beginning, to stop the dark / light dichotomy, picking up legendary heroes along the way.

Takes a couple decades of the travellers time, this also explains how Obi Wan ages 40 years in the 19  years between RotS and New Hope.

This would be a terrible B movie. I would love it.&&I'm still hoping they cast him in the Kenobi stand alone. &&I really didn't care much for Kylo in TFA  but he's definitely winning me over since TLJ.  I hope it finishes on a high note&&>Kylo is the benchmark now

But Kylo's actor clearly takes his character and the performance seriously, while Kenobi and palpatine knew they were starring in a cereal commercial, which is why their performances are masterclass and timeless.&&This was my biggest takeaway after watching TLJ&&I think you missed the point. Kylo being flawed is great from a character perspective. It makes him interesting.

Problem is, they've now made him the main villain, and he's as threatening as a kitten.

So he's an interesting character, but a terrible villain.&&I’d also be fine with Danny DeVito. &&Portman was fairly well known from Leon: The Profesional and Heat&&Natalie Portman was a movie star several years before The Phantom Menace came out.&&DC doesn't have much confidence in any of their live action movies which is why they are hot messes&&They're somewhere in the Last Jedi as faceless Stormies&&So... God-tier?&&This is my exact problem with it. Gotham, Metropolis, Central City, etc all feel like real places in other mediums. Other writers have spent considerable time making these places unique, it's one of my favorite things about the DCU. Marvel's Earth is much smaller and (in my opinion) more boring (why do so many heroes operate in New York?). It feels like the DCEU isn't taking advantage of it's amazing setting at all&&It's just lazy over reliance on greenscreen studios. 

Get a permit.... geeze&&its not quite that... I mean, I dont know what airport the civil war fight took place in... but it was a place...

I was cool with the car chase scene that opened the BvS.  but the later scenes where batman hits sup in his car, nameless dark back alley, the big fight, random abandoned dark roof top.  Even the final wonder woman fight devolved into a green screen fight.  And nearly every fight happens at night!&&Peter Berg is that you?&&I’ve never been to comic con. Do many young women and kids really attend? That shit’s expensive and it’s mostly waiting around in lines the whole time. If someone is already paying to get into the convention, and they really want to see a high profile celeb, I’d imagine it wouldn’t phase them to pay more to get an autograph, especially if they’re guaranteed a spot among thousands of other attendees.&&",2017-12-30 16:42:27

&&Wow. This was expected, but I'm still very disappointed. I'm genuinely very worried about how much Disney has been consolidating the entertainment industry, no one company should have so much control over our popular culture. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies (who doesn't), but at the end of the day, they're still a company, not your friend. The more of an industry a company controls, the more they view you as a number on a sheet.

Btw besides spiderman is there any major part of the marvel universe not under marvel entertainmemt now?&&I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Disney starts petitioning the government to repeal the law that prevents them from owning movie theaters.&&Reposted from the other Fox-Disney thread: 

A view of the horizontal merger (and that's an important concept) from someone actually affected by it and of the precedent this sets.

Fox is not a small fish operating in the entertainment pond - this was the top grossing studio (box office year to date) only three or four years ago. It was one of the bigger fishes with still profitable assets and aspirations in film AND television. Even its independent wing, Searchlight, has been operating at a high level after a down 2016 - just look at the Golden Globe noms this year.

Now, this big fish has been enveloped by the whale that is Disney. What happens when Disney gets hungry again and suddenly sees the franchise potential in a smaller fish (currently weaker asset) such as Paramount or Columbia Pictures (it's only Sony so long as Sony maintains their ownership)? Those are easier deals to make for the wigs of those companies and, considering the likely windfall of Disney's upcoming streaming service and merchandising, for Disney to offer whatever those owners want.

People are saying this is a monopoly - it isn't... Not yet. But, it is a horizontal merger (business consolidation that occurs between firms that operate in the same space) that could lead down the road of there being one. Fox wasn't some entity being rescued from solvency by Disney; this wasn't a wounded animal being taken down. This is one of the top studios being enveloped by the biggest studio.

There are mitigating factors that prompted the Murdochs to sell -- in fighting with the shareholders, arrests of certain princes and a fear of being unable to compete in the digital domain with the likes of Disney and Netflix decades from now... They're selling the company at its peak valuation or at least before it could take a hit.

People will say, ""well, Comcast was the other suitor so lesser of two evils, right?"" Is this November 2016 again? Neither suitor was suitable or would have been good for the industry - either way would have two major studios folding in on one another (Disney or Universal and Fox) in a horizontal merger. 

This isn't to say Fox needs to stay under 21st Century control, but there are other players that could have been tapped with the Murdochs wanting to sell - Apple, Google, even Amazon could have been suitors as they look to expand their businesses into a realm that they have been trying to establish some standing in. This would have been more of a vertical merger that would ultimately keep Fox around in the same capacity as Sony owning Columbia or Gulf Western owning Paramount back in the day.

Content-wise, aside from Bob Iger dictating about a third of what enters theaters and your televisions, consider what this means for the other studios - how do you compete with Disney? You fucking reboot reboot reboot... Everything is going to be created with the intent to franchise so buh-bye to the last semblance of adult-oriented content from the majors, you're being pushed aside for a sorry attempt at reinvigorating this or that old ass property.

The only hope are the A24 and Neons of the world, but there will always be a cap on their ability to load content into theaters at least in a wide capacity. This is especially true when you have Disney swinging its dick to make deals with the chains, like showing Star Wars in your biggest theater for a month and not a day less, or not showing it at all.

The last thing, and this should be a bit scary for those of you on this sub who were thinking of getting a job in the studio system, this will cut out one of the major employers in Hollywood. Not everyone at Fox is getting laid off, but there is going to be a human toll - there will be redundancies and experts/analysts have already said that Disney will look to trim $2.5 billion from these ""synergies"" once they swallow up Fox... That's a lot of people... Again, that's a human toll and those are jobs that will never come back.

So, enjoy your X-Men and Fantastic Four fighting in ""Avengers 6: The Quest for More Money,"" but I hope it doesn't blind you to how this is a seismic moment in the industry... At some point, and I know it seems like it will never happen, but there will be a lull in the comic book craze and I hope this will all still be worth it.

- Chicken Little (you can probably guess who I may or may not work for)&&The mcu will actually outlive me at this point im certain and im only 21.&&Here we go... This changes the entire game now. Everything changes. In a few years we'll see the consequences. 

Hopefully Lionsgate gets bigger and becomes the 6th big Studio again. &&I, for one, welcome our new mouse overlords&&Alien Queen is now a Disney Queen lmao&&Just in perspective, Disney bought Lucas Films for $4 billion and that was considered a lot.&&As exciting as it is that Marvel will have X-Men back under their wing, I'm very nervous about this purchase's implications for the movie industry. 

I'm not so sure it's a good thing for Disney to own everything. In fact, I think it could have a very negative impact on the industry. &&##[Please read Disney's full press release first](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock/)

Safe to say, he's pretty happy with how it went down.&&[deleted]&&Can they now replace J Law with someone actually mystifying? &&Who’s ready for Disney’s Deadpool, Alien vs Princesses and Archer on Disney Channel?&&This whole thing reminds me of the franchise wars mentioned in Demolition Man where Taco Bell bought up all the other restaurants in the country and so all the fancy restaurants were still called Taco bell. Soon enough everything is gonna be either Disney, Wal Mart, Amazon or Google&&On the one hand Disney is a step closer to having a monopoly on media, on the other....the MCU is gonna be off the chain. &&“We are the Disney, lower your stock and surrender your company. We will add your intellectual property and copyrighted material to our own. Your corporation will adapt to service us, resistance is futile.” ~ Mickey Mouse 2017&&Can someone help me get $52.5 Billion and we can buy it from Disney?&&So Disney will now own all the shows that come on Fox broadcast channel but it won't actually own the channel?

Will they try to screw over Gotham?&&I can't wait for the New King Of The Hill movie to start with a 22 minute Olaf cartoon.&&I see a lot of people worried about what's going to happen to their favorite content under Disney. I'm more worried about the abuse of market share and rapid monopolization Disney is undergoing throughout the entire entertainment industry. Monopolies are by nature uncompetitive and result in a decline in the quality of the product provided. This WILL end badly. &&It's **a lot**.

Hmmmmm.&&The biggest thing most people miss is that they now own a large stake in Hulu, Netflixs main competitor.&&https://www.foxmovies.com/movies

Grand Moff Iger: The Big Six will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Mouse has dissolved the majority shareholders permanently.

With mouse ears.&&""They can't do that! Regulate them, or something!""&&UNLIMITED POWEEEEER!!!&&I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of franchises suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.&&Netflix? Pretty sure Disney bought out Fox's share of Hulu, so i'd expect them to toss a lot of stuff on there.&&I mean, they essentially bought controlling stake in Hulu with this, too. They don't really need netflix, imo. &&They don't need to buy Netflix. I do wonder what they'll do with their Netflix shows cause of their stake in Hulu&&With this purchase disney doesn't need netflix. With their own content and fox content they can take all their properties off netflix and run their own.&&So no more J. Law? Reddit must be thrilled! &&Why do we suddenly have to assume that Disney is going to blow up everything at Fox? If New Mutants/Dark Phoenix and the next Deadpool wind up being good Disney has no reason to mess with the formula. &&That's impressive. What else have they predicted? &&When you guess so frequently eventually you get a few right. &&CONFIRMED: The writers of the Simpsons are the precogs from Minority Report. &&One of the major reasons Disney seemed keen for this deal to happen was to help set up a streaming service with more content and diversity they could do on their own.&&Because those people have this Left/Right, corporate/small guy, suits vs creative narrative they try to apply to every fucking thing. 

I had this very argument with a very big fish in the industry just last week, having to point out that Disney wants to the deal partly because it would allow them to release films that don't fit the ""Disney branding."" 

Mark my words, even on the Fox logo for, say, ***Avatar 2*** in very small print will be something like ""A Division of Buena Vista, Inc."" and not ""Walt Disney Pictures."" &&#SYNERGY
&&[deleted]&&It's not gonna be very dynamic once Disney owns everything.&&Yes, everything but fox news, fox sports and fox business according to bbc http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42353545&&Kinda wish they would distribute Star Wars under 20th century fox so we can get the same fanfare before the lucasfilm logo and opening crawl. &&Is this legally what had to happen for this to be possible? I would love that, they can re-canonize them.&&Over at /r/starwars someone mentioned that Pablo Hidalgo tweeted that it's not the distributor that's keeping the theatrical edits from being released.

They're speculating that it was a stipulation from George Lucas in the sale to Disney that they not be released. IDK why he's so adamant about it. People want it...&&That singing anteater in episode 6 really pisses me off.&&Not at all. Lucasfilms was star wars, indiana jones, and Red Tails. Fox is an entire studio and multiple tevevision stations. Its like quicksilver vs flash. One is just waaaaaaaayyyyyy beyomd the other.&&IIRC, it was a steal&&George sold it dirt cheap for whatever reason, its probably the best value purchase Disney will ever make. &&Fox Searchlight is definitely a concern. Disney has pretty much given up on non franchise fair. I hope they at least let Fox Searchlight continue to operate independently as they have a pretty good track record, especially at winning Oscars.&&If they don’t I’m sure Netflix will. There are going to be a lot of movies not on Netflix anymore. &&Do you mean second high budget Daft Punk music video?&&Just give me a 90 minute montage of Olivia Wilde dancing in a skintight suit to Daft Punk.&&##WE WANT TRON!&&Yeah come on Disney, we want more Tron!!!!&&I second that notion!&&It’s already happening; going to be directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of the Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman movie Oblivion. They originally abandoned Tron 3 after John Carter didn’t get the returns they wanted, but somewhere along the way acquired billions (I wonder what franchise from the 70s helped them out with that) and figured they’d give it a shot.&&Give us Tron 3!&&Remember, the Mickey Mouse copyright act is due for renewal soon&&I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Disney starts petitioning the government to repeal the law that prevents them from owning movie theaters. They're getting bolder and making a lot of power plays.&&While I wholeheartedly agree with you. The only other option in this purchase was Comcast. The good guys won here, even if it is still bad overall. 

Edit: I get it guys. Poor wording on my end. The better of the two options won. I never said the situation was ok, quite the opposite.&&You dare slander our Disney overlords you degenerate!? 

(Earning mickey's favor before he takes over the world) &&Let’s just get rid of the century-long copyrights that Disney themselves have lobbied Congress for. Copyright started out as 14 years of exclusivity, followed by publication in the public domain. And yet after the 1974 and then 1998 copyright acts, now it’s up to 140 years, and public domain has become a joke of what it should be (no recorded songs, repeat NOT A SINGLE SONG, has made it reliably past copyright and into the public domain, due to complex relationships between pre-1970s state and federal copyright laws). If those fuckers are gonna first protect the “artists” by pursuing copyright litigation, then buy up all of the world’s intellectual property themselves, so that they become the protected business for another century, I think the people have a right to fuck Mickey Mouse right in the mouth and pirate every Disney film and Mickey Mouse club graduate’s discography. &&Fox wanted to sell, and the other potential buyer was Comcast. I'd say Disney is the lesser evil.&&Technically universal still owns the Hulk rights and Sony still owns the Spider/man rights. Sony is sort of loaning out Spider-man, while at the same time still pursuing their own ""spideri-verse."" For example, they are doing their own Venom film without any reference to Spider-man, which just doesn't work IMO. The Hulk rights I think only include standalone films, which is why there hasn't been any serious talk of a new Hulk film, and why the Planet Hulk storyline was in incorporated into the latest Thor. 

What I would like to see happen with all this is for Disney to make deals with these studios to trade off properties that don't really fit their brand, such as Alien and Die Hard, in exchange for those rights and truly get all the Marvel characters under one roof.&&I agree, but Hit & Run was quite a fun game. &&EA already make Simpsons games.&&Hulk, She-Hulk, Namor are complicated as they cannot have standalone films due to rights and shit. Sony still owns distribution rights to the Spidey Roster.

Edit: Spelling.&&Hulk is still iffy on distribution rights, and there are a bunch of characters in the Marvel Universe that do not belong to Marvel, i.e. micronauts, ROM Spaceknight and other smaller stuff like that.

Actually, I'm not sure if the F4 are with Disney, since they weren't at FOX proper, but at another company that belonged/reported to FOX, but they should be with Disney.&&I’m not sure what marvel are gonna do. The X-men franchise is trying their best to get a universe going, will we see it get dropped in favour of a fresh reboot?&&Namor / Hulk are the only ones not fully at Marvel now I believe.&&Yes. Scott Summers as a strong tactician and leader, and not a one dimensional third wheel in a love triangle as he's been portrayed in all the X-men movies.&&Aren't those all owned by two or three companies already anyway? Industry consolidation is happening everywhere these days.&&I imagine that film companies have already been doing that since the law was put in place.&&So much this. One company now controls a disgustingly large amount of the content that we consume, and they’re driven by profit, not artistic drive. &&All they care about is ""Do we get the 20th Century Fox Fanfare in Star Wars again!? ZOMG!""&&Imagine a cinematic universe as long-lived as the comics universe.&&what consequences? &&Its funny thats their logo and Mickey and friends are the lowest profile characters of theirs. Why not make some more cartoons too?&&Can’t wait for Alien Versus Punisher&&LucasFilm had limited IP and Franchises though. 21CF has thousands of IPs, series, distribution deals, ownership stakes in Hulu and Sky, and so much more.&&>Disney bought Lucas Films for $4 billion and that was considered a lot.

Actually it wasn't. That's less than what Disney paid for not only Marvel, but Pixar as well. Disney got a steal with LucasFilm, specifically because George wanted to sell to Disney and not shop it around. &&[Also, please read one of the actual reasons why Fox selling itself to Disney, it is fascinating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7jayit/foxdisney_deal_to_be_announced_on_thursday_cnbc/dr5h5f4/).

The main points by /u/shempwaffles:
> 
> - Fox owner Rupert Murdoch wanted Fox to be the next Apple, but can't make deals happen to save his life
> 
> - American shareholders backstab Murdoch after wrestling control away from him as a side effect of some random unforeseen mass-arrest of their richest shareholders in Saudi Arabia  
> - Shareholders, now the majority owners of Fox, decide to use their new power to sell off their highly profitable franchises and assets - *that COULD push them forward as a company, which is what they want, by the way* - for much less profitable ventures on cable news which will inevitably collapse Fox News as a whole to it's demise.
> 
> It's basically the Harry Osborn subplot of Amazing Spider-Man 2 reenacted in real life. This explains why stock value skyrocketed when the deal is announced and why we know so much ""insider"" information to begin with.
>  [Here's more information about the Saudi Prince fiasco.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html) Check out the date, it's a week before the ""rumors"" began to surface - In quotations, because it was clearly meant to broadcast their intentions in advanced.&&This is how I feel about this. And since net neutrality was just repealed, if you want to make your own show or movie in this world you're basically fucked. Well thanks for dousing my dreams in kerosene corporate America. I'll just lube myself up so you can control every faucet and free will I have in my life.&&Disney has been dominating local and state politics for decades. They're now at the nation state level in terms of influence.

NAFTA and future trade deals will be built on provisions to protect and extend Disney's influence. &&What's wrong with Jude Law? &&> Alien vs Princesses

Will still be better than the Alien vs Predator movies.&&People said the same about the Lucasfilm purchase, ""who's ready for Darth Mickey"". Disney can own everything but at the end of the day they still know how to make movies and keep franchises.&&Wait, does this mean that Lana Kane is now a Disney Princess?&&Here we go. This is ALWAYS the argument. Pretty Sure the punisher tv show is pretty mature. I think it will be alright.&&They bought Fox just in time for Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart to say 'we're done with this'... Though I guess Marvel won't have to substitute inhuman stories for mutant stories anymore...&&Imagine the headlines lmao

*Reddit users fund raise enough money to buy 21st Century Fox*&&“Will they try to screw over Gotham?” 

Why would they?” It’s theirs to make money off of now, even if it is DC&&i thought they only own the cable channels like FX and FXX and such
&&This deal won't complete until 2019. The odds are that Gotham will be nearing it's conclusion by then anyway.&&Wow, Disney new streaming service just got a whole lot more interesting &&Interesting note; FOX lost it's production studio, but not it's broadcast TV stations. Heavily scripted/produced TV shows currently airing on FOX, like Empire, will likely move to ABC (or cancelled entirely) while FOX returns to focusing on news and live sports. I work in a station that houses both an NBC station and a FOX station, so it'll be interesting to see how things change over the next few years. &&Princess Dee?&&They've always had a stake in it (ABC), but yeah it's larger now that they have Fox's as well.&&Avatar is not on the list, cause the sequels didn't release yet. But it's probably the biggest name after X-Men.&&How will the Mouse maintain control without the bureaucracy?&&""The only big six that will remain is The Big Hero 6.""&&They will make it legal.&&There is still Netflix and asia. And sometimes europe, but most of that stuff is just dark or british.&&Reducing competition tends to fuel things that are currently awesome, but of course make others unable to compete. It's the same reason the average Joe will love net neutrality getting removed -- you can pay for unlimited Netflix, Facebook, and Reddit, and just a little bit of data for everything else on your phone, people will think that's awesome at first! It'll probably be cheaper too! But then all you have access to is Netflix, giving them an insurmountable edge over would-be competition. But Joe sure does love watching Netflix everywhere, so he's happy.&&Disney land- literally space mountain edition. &&It's like a million shareholders cried out in panic and were suddenly silenced.&&They also now own a sizable chunk of Sky which broadcasts satellite across Europe and has its own streaming services (Sky Go & NowTV)

Edit: [Here's](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/sky-stake-changes-hands-in-39-billion-disney21st-century-fox-deal-36408380.html) an article about Sky and Disney.&&According to Wiki it was previously shared between Disney(30%) Fox (30%) NBC (30%) Tine Warner (10%)... So this makes Disney the majority owner of Hulu, is Hulu just going to be their new streaming service? I mean Hulu is already a well recognized name, couldn't they just started calling it Disney's Hulu and pretty much double the subscribers on there.&&With the amount of things they own, Disney is very likely to offer their own streaming and make all their big stuff exclusive.&&Hulu is nothing compared to Netflix. Ask someone in Europe about Hulu.&&Well they just renewed Punisher for a second season the other day, so I think they are still going to produce Netflix shows... for now at least.&&I believe they already said the Netflix exclusive content would stay there. I imagine Hulu will be Disney's new streaming service, though. &&No more Fassbender/McAvoy :(&&What's wrong with Jude Law?&&Deadpool is really the only thing I want them to leave alone.  Reboot X-men in a few years into the MCU with a whole new cast and for fuck’s sake put out a good Fantastic 4 reboot.  &&I suppose the thought process is that Disney will have to nuke everything and start again to integrate them into the MCU.&&iirc they predicted Trump as president&&A lot. But they have also had a lot of ""predictions"" that didn't pan out.  When you spend nearly 30 years throwing stuff at the wall, it's inevitable that some of it will stick.&&/r/simpsonsdidit &&http://time.com/4667462/simpsons-predictions-donald-trump-lady-gaga/&&[911](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140516232716/villains/images/0/05/Simpsons9-11.jpg).&&Either that or there is the possiblity that with a weekly episode for 30 years that eventually they will predict everything, it's like the infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters eventually writing shakespeare thing.&&That is actually a smart move I didn't think about.  Right now they have Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney/Pixar films to headline their service but those all hit specific (if large) audiences.  Getting Fox and especially Fox Searchlight broadens out there library quite a bit.&&Hulu. They now control Hulu. &&#CONNECTITUDE&&And Fox network&&Yeah I agree, it always feels like somethings lacking if I watch the new movies. It's just so ingrained in my head to hear the 20th century fox music, then BAAAAAAAH&&They will make it legal.&&Yes. Disney owns 1-3, 5 and 6 but Fox holds the distribution rights to 1-6 until 2020 and Fox fully owns 4 in perpetuity. In order to get this released prior to this deal, they'd have to have brokered a deal with Fox for A New Hope and lose a lot of revenue in the process.&&I would not be surprised at all if that was part of the sale. George has a particular contempt for the fans.&&So who is more powerful quicksilver or flash? Not that familiar with flash.&&George was pretty much done with it and wanted it off his hands.  &&Probably since the budget of those films is less than a drop in the bucket for Gisnep.&&I feel people are forgetting that Disney also owns things like Touchstone Pictures, which still makes stuff like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies, often in a co-production with another studio.  
I see no reason their newly acquired Fox division shouldn't also have some of it's assets transferred over to the more adult pieces of the Disney Corporation, with only the more kid-friendly parts going under the main Disney banner.&&i want to watch movies on actual theaters&&I'm ok with that&&I wonder what Michel Gondry would do with a billion dollars.  &&I absolutely love the first one. &&As much as I'd like another one, I think Daft Punk stated that they weren't interested in scoring another film due to how Disney handled their music after release.&&You say that like it's a bad thing.&&Don't forget about Interstellar 5555, the Japanese-French animated adventure fantasy science fiction musical film.

You ever seen Interstella 5555?&&Hoping this country will get it's shit together by then and vote in politicians that will end this circus act.&&Hell, I support copyrights, but I still want Disney to lose the rights to original Mickey Mouse just out of spite.&&They basically own the theaters already with their ridiculous Star Wars screening requirements.&&Yeah, they definitely have the money to lobby for it.&&Disney is about *smart* decisions involving revenue streams. The last thing anyone wants to own right now is a theater chain. Mostly thanks to the average person on reddit....&&I guess you're right, the lesser of two evils happened. But dang, it's still an evil&&The *good* option would have been no purchase at all, by anybody.&&Let's be real here: the creative side of Disney are definitely the good guys, but corporate Disney is as evil as they come, and have been for a long time. They're just not *as* bad as Comcast, but let's not forget that Comcast and Disney work together frequently.&&[deleted]&&It's really less about Disney being evil or not and more that *any* corporation being this big is bad for whatever industry it's in.&&I've always dreamed of a sequel to that game, with graphics that look like *The Simpsons Game* and actually have the whole city (and not split apart). They could just listen to the fans and actually use [The Simpsons map](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/f/f7/Map_of_Springfield.png/revision/latest?cb=20100117045534) that was made.&&Hit and run was a lot of fun. Hell I wouldn't mind a Ubisoft Simpsons game.&&So technically they could make a Illuminati movie at this point with Namor, like with Hulk atm&&Sony still owns the film and TV rights to Spider-Man.

They're published by a different company now&&I think it would be a good introduction to ""Hey, let's cross some dimensions"" in the MCU. I think the X-men are the perfect team to bring a more surreal side to what Marvel has done and could be a good middle ground between the Dr. Strange mysticism and the more mainstream and cosmic stories. &&Huge difference.  If they allow studios to own theater chains again then those studios can decide to only show their own movies.&&Not consequences but ‘aftermath’. Fox makes some excellent R rated movies (not talking about Deadpool and Logan). Hopefully Disney will keep taking risks and not Disney-fy everything, &&They do make new Mickey cartoons, and honestly it's a much better attempt at merging old and new humor than anyone else has tried.&&Well those characters are around a hundred years old.

Because they aren't completely throwing stuff on the wall. Often they go with stuff that actually does have a possibility of happening. 20 years ago, it was possible that in the future Disney would buy 20th Century Fox.

Its not impressive they just don't know what they are talking about.
    
Yes this is a pet peeve of mine, why do you ask?
   
The *real* reason they aren't close is that Quicksilver has traditionally been merely like ""jet fighter fast"" which is still pretty damn fast against Marvel's most famed properties but say probably doesn't merit the whole time stands still treatment the movies have done. 

And Flash of course has pretty much always started at being so stupid fast he breaks reality into little bitty pieces and does whatever the writers want. Even after they invented the Speed Force to try and justify that nonsense. &&Huh, does marvel has a speedforce equivalent? I know the flash can break physics thanks to that (like how every part of his body isn't crushed by the G forces he has to deal with thanks to his speed) but what's Quicksilver's excuse?

I don't read comics, so excuse me if it's a dumb question.

Flash is a fucking stupid superhero.&&There's no Speedforce equivalent. Quicksilver's body is just durable enough to withstand the speed.&&They answered this question pretty definitively in the (now *super* hard to find for what I presume are publishing reasons) Avengers/JLA 4-part series they did just over a decade ago.

In short; Flash is far, *far* faster than Quicksilver in the DCU because of the Speed Force, and try as he might Quicksilver just can't tap into it himself. But in the MCU there *is* no Speed Force, so Flash retains whatever momentum he had when he enters the MCU for as long as he can hold onto it, but once it wears off he's literally just a regular guy who Quicksilver delighted in finally getting to run laps around.&&I don't think Marvel has anything like speedforce.   I believe Quicksilver's excuse is that he's a mutant born with the innate ability to vibrate his molecules really fast.  &&God that's so sad. The remix album is very impressive too. So many artists that really brought out their own creative guns to pay Daft Punk some respect. It's definitely a shame Disney wasn't more open and accountable, because that could have been a serious win for all parties involved.&&It sucks that they did that, but the remix album is pretty fantastic.&&Do people do this? You go to the movie theater without figuring out a show time first?&&[deleted]&&Yes but Spider-Man was only in Civil War with the permission and cooperation of Sony (and vice versa with MCU characters in Sony films, like Tony Stark, Happy, and Pepper Potts in Homecoming).

I think that DC probably retconned this, but it's the one thing that bugged me about that scene in JL/Avengers

Now, what is going to suck is the combination of lots of content owned by a few companies who are also owned by ISPs and net neutrality is gone combined with annual only streaming contracts. 

Then, pirating will see a resurgence like a motherfucker. &&As of today. With the erosion of net neutrality the packaging of Internet content would likely give way to bundles. And unlike Netflix, Disney has been bundling content and selling it to different channels of distribution for *decades*. 

With their vertical integration there would be only two parts of the business of watching outside of their control: the provision of Internet service and hardware used to play it. They have an excellent relationship with one of the top hardware sellers in Apple, and they have the financial muscle to reach whatever deals the ISP give them, or even enter the business themselves.&&While they're at it they should start supporting 5.1 surround sound.

The 'Lost Boys': Hollywood producer Gary Goddard accused of sexual misconduct by 8 former child actors,37755,7l1b1b,http://beta.latimes.com/politics/la-fi-ct-goddard-accusers-20171220-story.html,2561,1513775608.0,,"Completely mis-read the title.

I don't suspect he would just toss around any false claims.&&If there’s one things about living in Hollywood I never could stomach. It’s all the damn paedos. 

Edit: To whomever gave me gold for this I thank you for validating my already over-inflated sense of self worth. 

Joking aside, to anyone else who wants to buy me or anyone else gold, please just give it to charity instead. Is it good to financially support a website you enjoy? Yes. But Reddit doesn’t need the money. It’s backed up by incredibly rich venture capitalists. The concept of Reddit Gold only exists to create a false sense of community to keep you all coming back. Same with the Reddit Santa thing. Just give the money to charity. 

Or just do whatever you want ‘cos what the fuck do I know? I’m just a twat who’s seen Lost Boys too much. &&It's just so damn disturbing that all of these accused counterargue against the crimes committed with this appalling attitude of ""this is such old news"". No. That doesn't erase the years of trauma you've brought upon the victim. These were young kids moreover, mind you. And you ask why they're (victims) are bringing this up now? Because it was such injustice and they've finally found the courage and voice. So a big fuck you to all you pedo bastards out there.&&Welp, looks like Corey Feldman doesn't need that 10 million anymore.

EDIT: Um, actually Goddard had nothing to do with the movie the Lost Boys.  He directed a traveling play of Peter Pan, hence the Lost Boys headline.  But he did direct Masters of the Universe, so he's got that going for him.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&What's up with guys named Gary G and being into kids?&&I was having cocktails with a cinematographer friend of mine some years back. He was telling some story or other from the set of Deep Blue Sea. I asked him how it was working for Renny Harlin, who has a reputation for being troublesome to work with. I expected to hear an anecdote from the set or some calamity. Instead, my friend didn't skip a beat and said, deadpan,  ""He's a fucking pedophile."" Caught me completely off guard. 

Edit: Not the cinematographer from Deep Blue Sea, Stephen Windon. I didn't mean to imply that. Another camera crew member who will remain nameless.&&Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, hide yo husband's cause they rapin everybody in hollywood&&Okay I think this is a perfect opportunity to shed some light on *why* these allegations take so long to appear. I hear way too many people say ""if theyre telling the truth why didn't they say it sooner?!""

Imagine you're a kid. Your parents thrust you into this big confusing world and suddenly some producers and directors are making you uncomfortable. You talk to the other child actors and they all get uncomfortable as well. You don't like what's happening but no one else seems to be talking about it or bothered by it and you're just so happy to be the star of a Hollywood movie, so you do your job hoping to eventually put it all behind you.

Fast forward to Harvey Weinsten and Bill Cosby, and one of the other 7 stars finally says, #MeToo. But it was a long time ago and you're mostly over it by now. Sure you've never had a healthy adult relationship but that doesn't matter. What matters is they're finally getting busted for it. So you pick up the phone, call NPR and say hey, #MeToo.

*That's* why we hear nothing, until suddenly we hear *everything*. There's power in numbers. Enough of this ""crimes should be reported when they happen"" bullshit. That's hopefully the future. We're currently dealing in the past, and if we want the future to be better, we have to fix the mistakes of the past. &&The cesspool in hollywood is long overdue for a cleanup. Hopefully this keeps rolling right over the rest of the scumbags and pedophiles.&&This is crazy. My family was in the special effects industry and knew Gary pretty well in the 90's. His name was a household one, although I never really knew any of his movie work. Instead, it was always veiled or blatant jokes about how he liked little boys. Growing up in LA county everyone 'knew' how Hollywood worked. All these allegations are no surprise.  


So, the story goes that my dad and his business partner would bring their sons to work with them. They made video games and special effects, so the office was like disneyland. Full for toys and the newest video games for us to play with in a giant theatre. Gary would stop by the office from time to time, so of course we met. Apparently, from my dads account, I instantly didn't like him. I guess he tried to buddy up to me and I smacked him in the head with a toy. This caused Gary to never really like me. 


The family joke now goes that I saved myself from Gary by hitting him with that toy. And that my friend, the business partners son, wasn't so lucky. 


I'm interested to see where this goes. Hopefully he gets all the justice in the world delivered to him. Go to hell Gary.

&&I believe these boys. Like female rape victims they have nothing to gain from admitting to this. The stigma of being raped/assaulted/molested is horrible and has only recently been something people can talk about openly in the public eye. I think there are many child actors, especially boys, who have been molested and raped by trusted adults/mentors in their lives. Very few come out to confront their abuser(s) however. Especially being a straight adolescent, if you were assaulted by a man you respected, it would make you question allllllll kinds of things about yourself. Whether there was something about you that meant only men would like you, whether you deserved the advances, whether you should tell anyone, who would believe you..... it’s crazy. Kids are innocent enough that they can still love (as a friend) and respect someone who occasionally does bad things to them. That’s what’s so unforgivable. That trust you have in a person who everyone likes, who is competent, who is in a role of power, who repeatedly violates your personal space. It’s so easy to say “it was nothing,” and tell yourself it won’t escalate. It’s possible to like the qualities of a person but abhor their actions toward you. I think that’s the most confusing part for victims.

What this man did is actively pursue young boys. He preyed upon the ones that held him in highest esteem to protect himself from being found out.&&May his rice instantly transform into maggots for the rest of his lifetime&&""His publicist Sam Singer."" Not that this makes Goddard guilty, but it's worth noting that when you have a public relations or potential legal nightmare on your hands, Sam Singer is the man to call.  This is true not just of celebrities and Hollywood A-listers, but also CEOs, big corporations, and even public governmental agencies that are in some kind of trouble with the public they serve. I worked for a public transit agency that used Singer's services when they were in a couple of tough spots.


Singer specializes in ""crisis communications."" I doubt he is Goddard's regular publicist.

This shit happens everywhere, the only difference is the famous peoole end up in the news paper.&&And police forces, fire departments, schools, restaurants, etc. 

Sexual abuse and assault isn't strictly limited to a couple of industries - it's in *every* industry where there are people in a position of power. It's about power, it's about control. 

The scumbags are everywhere. Let's give the victims or persons likely to be victims the knowledge to recognize the signs of abuse/power & control and show them where they can get help to prevent it, to stop it, and to help others who may not be able to. First off, let's stop blaming the victim and thinking this only happens in rich worlds. It happens everywhere. &&The church too. Can't forget them.&&Sports, schools, children's groups.&&Fuckin hell man, seriously. Like enough. Stop ruining children’s innocence and abusing women. Why do we have to ask our government and the people that run the entertainment industry to be DECENT fucking people. Not that hard to NOT be a scumbag. If a normal citizen that wasn’t integrated into politics or rich would be in bars because that shit is terrible to do another human. It’s evil.&&...life. &&Don’t forget fashion! All those designers and photographers have pretty much unlimited access to the world’s most beautiful women and men, and most models start getting into high end modeling at 14 or 15. These are young, naive girls and boys, desperate to make it big, spending hours with men they don’t know who could change their lives. 
Edit: added men and boys because they are also at risk for sexual assault, and it’s abhorrent either way. &&And retail, and service industries, and law, and medicine, and engineering, and science, and oh it's everywhere huh?&&how about getting them out of everywhere? i'm upset that people care so much about these predators in the media industry but were ignorant to the issue beforehand. sexual assault occurs to the average citizen as well, where's their support?&&I want people like this out too, but accusations are accusations until proven otherwise. Sets a bad precedent for our due process system. &&And reddit, there are many subreddits grooming people to be abusers and teaching them to get away with that shit. It's *primarily targeting men to abuse women and preferably young*. It's even more rampant over at Voat and by extension 4chan,but reddit needs to keep an eye on the ""sexual extremists"" and their recruiting... &&If you do that there will be no one left in Hollywood, Politics or the music industry.

I've always felt a strange kinship to Anthony Edwards, so this hits particularly close to home for me. 

&&Why do victims need to above normal character to prove themselves to be taken seriously over a fucking pedophile? Why do you people hold pedophiles in such a high regard over their victims? This I find as disgusting as the pedohphile themselves. &&can I say something without getting bashed? I feel like girls have less credibility than guys when accusing someone of sexual missconduct. It's kinda sad.&&I’m glad you said this, but I also wish something like this was said in the top comments of any of the posts where women were the accusers. &&Anyone read his piece on Medium?

&&It's the same argument pedo and rape apologists have. They've never been through it, so they have the luxury of not understanding why it is so hard to come out about this stuff.

I mean these guys would send each other pictures of the boys to ""recommend"" certain ones, it's disgusting... I'm really starting to believe the ""Pedophile Ring"" Feldman spoke about, it makes sense that when you like to do something so hideous and illegal you'd make friends with others with the same interests to share and help each other out... this is so disturbing... &&The Corey Feldman $10M thing sounds so shady.&&Courtney Cox is at risk!&&*talk to me Goose...*&&Revenge of the Nerds, Top Gun, ER, Zodiac… the guy has had quite a career. &&You leave [Gary Gygax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax) alone!&&*da nah nah nah* **HEY**&&Gary Gergich?&&I do not want to be in his gang.&&Hey you leave Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons and Dragons, out of this!&&They like the glitter?&&Kinda like serial killers having the middle name Wayne. &&Do you want to be in my gang?&&They thought they'd get away with it forever but they are so dumb They are really dumb.

I think you mean, you're conditioned into believing that this is the best possible thing that could be happening to you right now.   
  
But yes, it's not just power in numbers, it's weakness in singularity. One random actor, however famous, is no match to some producer that can tell every agent he's in contact with to shut up about it, under the threat that all actors under that agent are forever kept out of the loop, ending several careers. Not to mention tell the same agent and/or any other agent, to tell their (other) actors, to come out and say what a wonderful person he is.&&Your dad knew he was like this and still chose to do business with him? AND bring you around him?!&&Ayyyy fellow SOAD Fan&&>  Kids are innocent enough that they can still love (as a friend) and respect someone who occasionally does bad things to them. 

In families this is how abuse can go from one generation to the next.

Tragic.&&Guess what I'm eating man&&May he step on a Lego every day of his life.&&Not sure if you are aware and just making a joke about the title or not. But the article is NOT about the director of the 1987 horror-comedy ""The Lost Boys"" and is about some producer who did musical productions when he was younger, one of them being Peter Pan and the ""Lost Boys"". Title was made deliberately confusing for some douchebag reason that I cannot comprehend.&&Did you know Corey Haim? That sounds like you knew him&&It's true.

Miller, just because of the anonymity and lack of corroboration.&&And don't forget people making the accusations under their own name.&&They're inspired by the courage of others coming forward about their experiences. Not all assault is reported immediately for many reasons- fear of retribution because the abuser is in a position of power, mainly.&&Most predators carefully pick their victims. It is why they are able to go thru life, often times never being exposed. &&These people had Mossad agents killing anyone who would talk.&&If God’s punishing pedophiles with fire why isn’t the Vatican just a pile of ash?&&It doesn't make a lot of sense to burn all of SoCal for a group of child diddlers. Individual lightning bolts/anal hounds from hell would be just as effective. I know many good people in SoCal who aren't in the business of using their business to get up in kids' business.&&It's still incredibly callous and stupid. And somewhat ignorant of SoCal geography, since why the heck would you categorize all of SoCal as ""Hollywood""? Not to mention that the whole damn world should be ablaze, if that's the case.&&No, it's still callous and stupid.&&How can you possibly feel conflicted over the idea of innocent people having their houses burned down because some of their neighbors have been accused of crime? You have a moral compass, I'd recommend you use it.&&You're conflicted about it? Are you fucking serious? SoCal is an ignition-limited ecosystem: the canyons that cut through the transverse ranges align pretty well with the direction of the Santa Ana winds and turn into funnels. It's a tinderbox. Los Angeles burned before there was a Los Angeles, the only difference now is the amount of people living there. Set an intentional or accidental fire and the only thing that'll stop it is the Pacific Ocean. No God's hand necessary. 

If God wanted to punish people who hurt kids, why doesn't he burn those responsible for war and starvation? 17,000 children die every day of preventable causes, and you think the culmination of God's wrath is handful of creeps in Hollywood? How fucking first-world-problem of you. 

Don't you dare listen to those lunatics. First you start listening to what the religious zealots have to say about pedos, next thing you're going to start listening to them when they talk to you about God punishing gays, or jews, or whomever else they disagree with. If there is a God, you will know his works through reason, not through idiots parroting their Facebook groups.&&[deleted]&&My brother tried telling me that the California earthquakes a few years ago were God's punishment for the porn industry filming out of warehouses out there.

That is where the movie got its name from after all. So it could be that this person took the fact that some of the boys in question were playing the Lost Boys in a Peter Pan production and used the name as a fitting description of the situation. But it also could be deliberate, I don't know.&&If you look up ""The Lost Boys"" online (IMDB or whatever), Goddard is not listed as one of the producers, nor does Lost Boys show up in his list of credits, so the reference may be misleading.&&I'd be fucking livid if I was the producer of the Lost Boys.

Because it is a common allusion.&&Unsuprising, given Hook's predilection for trying to get his ~~hands~~ hand on little boys. &&sick ass-fort&&Two chaperones are protection for the adult.&&[deleted]&&Like the Flintstones, they had a gay ol' time.

Edit: I'm just making a joke. I realize this is a sensitive topic. I don't mean to offend anyone, gay or straight, and especially not Flintstone's fans. &&I try specifically not to when I read about shit like this. I've experienced a hostile work environment before but I can't imagine my career, dreams, livelihood etc. depending in any way on what I do or do not let my boss do to me. Hollywood is so fucked man I hope the huge group of people victimized by that culture get their justice.&&It's interesting...  If you look at all their IMDB profiles you immediately see that these slimeballs follow each other around from movie to movie. &&It would've looked like the scene in The Matrix 2 fighting off swarms of Agent Smith&&Probably not too far off from most other sets in Hollywood. This goes deep.&&[deleted]&&Pretty sure with the recent Fox acquisition by Disney, Singer's at least done.  Disney would be fucking stupid to bring him back for more X-men movies.&&Until they get to prison where their Hollywood experiences are limited to being Shawshanked.&&What was Bryan Singer accused of?&&For some reason Bryan has been untouchable despite it being known for years.&&Bryan singer parties (where Bryan rapes little boys) have been a staple of the xmen franchise so probably not.&&They are. &&rumor on the blog world is shit is going to hit the fan for him in 2018&&like Geffen records?? dang&&Dan Schneider is next&&Is this because he was involved with DEN? Just asking out of curiosity here as this is the first time I've seen his name come up in rumours&&Especially considering no one has presented a credible accusation against Singer.

In fact, most of the accusations that werent from people he supposedly molested were pretty much gay bashing.&&They did the same thing to Ian McKellan the other day too.  He was speaking out against abuse, but the title gore made it sound like he was being accused.&&I work in the hospitality industry, and this shit is so rife with this crap it makes Hollywood look amateurs.   Servers with Restaurant mangers to get jobs, hotel managers with maids keep their minimum wage job (& throw in a language barrier here too)  Chefs & staff of all departments just because they're assholes & can. &&Fact is, the United States are very susceptible to what celebrities do and say. So, if the “famous people” are fighting back against sexual abuse it could spark a sort of shift of mind for the average Joes, so that they start fighting this back as well.

It’s sad that celebrities have that much power on the psyche of a people, but at least now it’s put to good use.&&fuck yes. at least these rich people assaulted have the money to pay for the therapy and medication for the trauma they experienced. sadly the server at the local bar doesn't have the income for that and has to face her assaulter every day at work.&&Hell, I've worked at a restaurant for 3 years and one of my bosses blatantly sexually harasses me, sometimes in front of the owner, and then everyone jokes about it. I'm a guy, so they don't take it seriously. There's one person there who stands up for me, and even though it's not much and nothing has changed, I'm grateful for her to be there when things like that happen. &&exactly. this is the truth. this whole upset over celebrities being assaulted bothers me because until it was their favourite celeb accused, no one cared to talk about it. and once hollywood is clean of these people, everyone will go back to not caring.

and how many people here accessed those nude celebrity leaks of the fappening? reddit was all over that. hypocrisy at its finest.&&Exactly.  It bothers me that people want to demonize a few industries without acknowledging that this stuff happens in virtually all industries.  It doesn’t always reach the headlines in less glamorous fields, but it happens.   Let’s make this less a “Hollywood is evil” and more “sexual misconduct is evil. ” &&We need to be careful about conflating different types of sexual abuse. Adults that abuse children are ALWAYS in a position of power. Their power dynamic is nothing like between two adults. &&Nah, let's just transfer them to other parishes.&&Cardinal Law of decades of Boston Archdiocese abuse cover up died today. In luxury in Vatican City while holding one of the four official basilica priesthoods. But at least he is now dead.&&Just that fact that it's 8 accusations should be enough to not be taken lightly.&&I hear your point, but tbf I don’t think any allegation like this should be taken lightly. Innocent until proven guilty, but anytime sexual misconduct is directed at children, it needs to be thoroughly investigated.  &&Dude was great in Zodiac.&&Never take accusations lightly. &&As cool as Maverick and Iceman were, Goose was always my favorite&&Plus, many predators target victims who will be considered less believable on purpose.&&On the one hand, a person with a good moral character is more easily believed when accusations come out. If you have a low moral character, the tendency is to think, ""If they shown poor morals before, perhaps they would also stoop low enough to lie about something like this."" If you have a high moral character, the tendency is to think, ""This person has consistently shown high morals, so I give them the benefit of the doubt in this accusation."" I think that makes sense.  

On the other hand, we don't *really* know anything about any of these people, so who are we to say who has high or low moral character? It's all a little ridiculous. &&It's not ""over a fucking pedophile"" unless the accused individual actually did the things they are accused of doing. Just like with *normal* rape, there are false accusations in these kinds of cases too, and we wouldn't want to convict an innocent person, now, would we?&&I think you are assuming way too much to take offense from that dudes post. He just said one dude was known to be a really nice guy, not that the others shouldn't be taken seriously.&&We live in a nation founded on ""innocent until proven guilty"".

Case closed.&&I think that its a good thing we have high standards before we start to believe accusations. We dont want a return to a time when a random accusation of witchcraft was enough for a death sentence.

Looks like your computer has chicken pox&&Work in Hollywood, Fl . Red flags all over this bitch. App is great( if it’s the same one) shows pics and crimes also.&&[deleted]&&I like to think that the majority of people that subscribe to the apologia are ""slippery slope"" type people and with rape and sexual assault often happening when there aren't witnesses or tangible physical evidence, it means often times (especially in cases where the claims are made years later) in order to ""believe"" someone, you have to accept a claim without evidence. Doing that short circuits some people's mind and I think it's easy to see why if you believe in law and the justice system as a principal. However, considering the fact that sexual assault and harassment often happen under circumstances where proof is near impossible, it would seem improbable to ever deal with sexual assault claims in a satisfactory manner, at least if satisfaction equals taking criminals off the street. Too often, I think people will see a criticism of the justice system and react as if that critic is implying that everyone involved is rotten to the core and needs to be shot. Reform is not revolution, after all. 

At least, that's what I hope. I hope every loud proclamation of ""what happened to innocent until proven guilty"" with tons of upvotes are just people paranoid about the ""slippery slope"" of societal guilty verdicts without trials. I hope they don't just lack empathy. I know some people do or else these the abuse wouldn't be happening in the first place, but I hope the majority that buy their apologia are just trying not to get caught up in a mob, even if it can be at the expense of nuanced thinking at times.&&It’s referencing the Lost Boys from a production of Peter Pan he did, that some of these victims were a part of. It’s right in the article. &&I would agree with you if it weren't for the fact that he's been trying to do something about this for a few years now, and the only response he would get from the media was ""Think of the industry, what are you doing to the industry"" and so on.   He's gotta be jaded at this point.  Can't really say I blame him for wanting a payout, personally.&&He won't get the $10 million, but since he set it up as a flexible campaign he'll get some quick money without any strings when the campaign ends in a few days. Right now it's over $270k.

It sucks that the guy's had to face what he has in life, but that doesn't mean what he's doing with that Indiegogo and other things aren't shady.&&How?

Edit: speaking of shady, the comment I'm replying to smells EXACTLY like astroturfing. It's literally a comment trying to discredit an accuser based on feels with no evidence.&&It absolutely is.

edit: just wanna add -- I believe the guy too. I 100% believe whatever he says about being molested by whichever pedos in Hollywood. But the asking for 10 mil on that particular website for a docu-drama film about it? Yeah, that's just fucking weird. Doesn't mean he isn't also telling the truth tho

guys -- you can have more than one thought in your head at a time. Corey isn't some huge piece of shit, and he isn't some perfect creature.

Like your neighbor is having an affair. If you hear your boss is racist do you quit to teach them a lesson? He never left me alone with him, public meeting with lots of people in business offices. But he was never a part of our lives, just business connections. &&maggots?&&No, I did not know him personally. I was just an obsessed tween madly in love with him back in the day. When License to Drive came out there were rumors that he had been raped by an older male mentor (I always suspected David Geffen) either during Lucas or on Lost Boys. His drug problem started around that time and he just spiraled downward. It was horrible to watch.

The claim now that Charlie Sheen raped him while filming Lucas doesn't pass the smell test for me. Sheen is an ostracized dirtbag pariah easy to blame. I always suspected (as did others) that it was someone very powerful in Hollywood. Someone who is still there, who has hurt others, and who hopefully will be brought down now that accusers are being listened to.&&Dan ""hold her tight, or else she'll bite"" Schneider&&My rule of thumb applies regardless of the anonymity of the accuser(s).   I fully support anyone who chooses to remain anonymous.  Way too many victims get attacked by idiots with axes to grind.

Have you listened to him speak about other things? Have you seen his act? His band?
Do you take him seriously? Do you believe all the other things he says? 

Those are the reasons why UNFORTUNATELY.

Do not misunderstand:
I hope people believe him and he gets justice. He's just his own worst enemy at times. (And yes I get that may be due to his being molested). I feel for the guy. He seems like a sweet kid. But a little out there which doesn't help his case &&I don't know a lot about this, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Feldman came forward too soon.

Obviously that's a terrible thing to say, I know, sexual misconduct should be reported as soon as possible. That being said, at the time when he first started talking about it, Hollywood as an institution was a lot less nervous about this sort of thing, so Feldman was easier to discredit.

But now there's a lot of it all at once, which makes it impossible to ignore or cover up, had Feldman joined in now, things might have gone differently.&&Or goonies or gremlins...probably ghoulies too just because they can’t remember the names right.&&Just think of all the people that will read the title and never make it far enough into the comments to realize they misread the title (like I did).&&Lost Boys is Santa Cruz, a few hours up the coast.&&He sort of did, on Dr. Oz of all things&&So that's why he calls his penis The Trebuchet.&&Relevant XKCD https://xkcd.com/37/&&Exactly. I'm not going to sleep over with kids. Like, not even family, unless there's some accountability involved.

&&Depends on how mouthy you are with the cop. It can go from public urination to indecent exposure with one smart ass comment. &&probably should stop peeing in public, then.
&&It only lists level 2 and 3 offenders.

Level 1 offenders (low risk of reoffense or minor offenses) aren't listed.

&&Don't know about nationwide, but where I live, only level 2 & 3 sex offenders show up on the website.&&I love how reddit's always so fast to remind folks of this fact.&&Which app are you talking about? Just searched in the App Store for Megan's Law and the only thing that came up is one of those helicopter mom apps where you can track the locations of your friends and family &&I guess you can get put on the list for public urination, but I've never seen that. It's used for sex crimes like rape, public masturbation, child molestation, etc. It shows the name, mugshot, crimes they were convicted of, and where they live. They can't live near schools/ playgrounds and such.&&I live in a small town. I just did a search for anybody within two miles of my address, and here's what I came up with.

* 2 Statutory Rape-2nd Degree
* 1 Statutory Rape-1st Degree (Under 14)
* 1 Sexual Assault-1st Degree
* 2 Sexual Assault 2nd Degree
* 1 Sexual Misconduct with a Child
* 2 Forcible Rape
* 1 Attempted Lewd & Lascivious Conduct with a Minor
* 1 Sodomy (This one would have also been statutory rape; older case.)
* 1 Sexual Activity with a Minor
* 1 Child Molestation-1st Degree
* 1 Sexual Misconduct-3rd Degree

It shows their name, address, picture, description, age, date of conviction, crime, and age/sex of the victim.

Only one sent up a red flag for me...a guy convicted of sexual misconduct with a child, where there was an age range for the victim, who was also male, which *could* have made the victim only a year younger than the guy on the list. This could have been a case of homophobia leading to a criminal conviction for something that would be fine today, since it was an older case. Or not, since there was an age range.&&I have a feeling that the public urination sex offender meme is just that. A meme.&&The resources I've encountered usually show name, address, birth date, a mug shot, and description of the offense as well as the ages of the victim and the individual at the time of the offense. There are also mapping capabilities available.

While it is possible to show up on the list for public urination, the majority of those on the list that pulled up in a 2 mile radius around my residence (large major city) were unfortunately for rape or sexual assault. On the extremes, there was one child murder and the ""least offense"" was someone who got nabbed for soliciting a minor over the internet. Most of the victims were around 13-15 years old while the youngest was 5. It's pretty eye opening.&&wait, reddit links to articles?!

>a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime.

Its not a confession. Feldman didn't commit a crime. It would be a record of his accusations.&&> Cory Feldman

Unfortunately, Feldman is pretty *out there* so a lot of people took his accusations with a huge grain of salt for a long time. Now, however, with all of this coming out, I think more and more people finally believe him. 

I give Feldman a lot of leeway with his behavior. He's a childhood sexual abuse victim, and I know how much that can fuck someone's mind up.&&It bums me out that other child actors who are still well-respected have spoken about pedophelia in Hollywood and acknowledged it is a problem, whether they were victims or not, and they’re to be believed but people still ignore Corey.

Certainly not so weird that I'd think he's delusional or making things up.

Other states don't differentiate and in then the list is more equal.

Also, look at the year if crime and the age.  Rape of a minor sounds bad, but if they were 18 when the crime happened it might have been a 15 year old girlfriend whose parents called the cops.  If they were 45 when it happened, then you can be sure they are a predator.&&Well that makes me feel better. &&I asked a judge, and he said it doesn't happen.

Mouthing anyone is a bad idea just like being a bully with authority is not an appropriate response to immaturity.&&It's only for public urination if in an eyeshot of a school or daycare center. Or if kids are visible present. Had an issue a long while ago...&&It is a lot, though. For comparison's sake, OJ: Made in America was made for $1 million. Citizenfour was also $1 million. &&this might sound bad but it wasnt until women started coming out that the media finally gave a shit and people started to actually care so the men were able to start talking too&&Except it wasn't going to be a documentary. It was going to be a bio pic, about him.&&He doesn't even want to make a documentary.

The point is that Terry is a saint. &&°__°&&I believe “testimony” is the word they were looking for&&his band is SUPER creepy. I don't have to like the guy to take him seriously. &&Elijah Wood specifically referenced what happened to Feldman as an example of the fucked up things that were happening to kids in Hollywood.  Sadly, it took Elijah Wood taking Feldman seriously before anyone else did.&&There's an excellent novel by Bret Easton Ellis from the fucking 80s called *Less Than Zero* where the characters are more or less children of hollywood and it touches on pedophillia and sexual depravity.

Although most people probably didn't take it seriously because it's Bret Easton Ellis.
&&Part of the problem is that if you make a complaint against a producer/director/studio head or whatever, you aren't working for that individual again, and with blacklisting, you might not work ever again.

Well done. &&All the way in the distant future- the year *1997!*&&No, that's what got us into this mess.&&That only worked because Polanski is a French citizen so there's no extradition. As an aside, Polanski wasn't truly safe but for the fact that California and the USA refused to give French prosecutors their evidence so that France could prosecute him locally (that's the agreement between the USA and France regarding protocol for French citizens who committed crimes in the USA but are in France). Anyway, most of these guys are only American citizens, so it'll be harder to hang out somewhere that isn't a total craphole that would not extradite. &&They would be extradited. Polanski was protected from extradition because he was legally a French citizen and because the judge of his case screwed up and the legality of the trial is questionable. &&Fair point.&&Steve Harvey?&&[This a##hole for sure](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThmYTkxZDYtMWM5NS00NGExLTgyN2YtNjg1MzUxZjcxZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDEwMjgxNg@@._V1_.jpg)&&There are more recent victims, I guarantee it. Hopefully this leads to a real investigation.&&That applies to rape.   Some of these allegations do not fit the definition of rape and that law wouldn't be retroactive.  It would apply only to rapes committed after the law was made.  So as I said ""Unfortunately they might not be able to charge them, there maybe a statute of limitations on their crimes."" &&Those laws can't be retroactive.  They only apply to rape cases that happen after the passing of that bill&&That's wonderful for everything after that date, however the US Supreme Court has already determined that it is unconstitutional to backdate such legislation. So from 2016 onwards there will be no statute of limitations, but for everyone before 2016 convicted, statute of limitations still apply.

There's good reason for such a ruling. You don't want the government going and making something illegal and then arresting everyone that took part in such a thing for the last 50 years, and oh yeah, all those arrested just happened to be the political enemies the very people who pass the legislation.&&most people don’t even know that the real version of Days of Future Past only got a home video release, it wasn’t really marketed. it’s called “The Rogue Cut” and is like 30 minutes longer, and makes the already great film like 10 times better.

The US and [France](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/184239.pdf) do have an extradition treaty also one with the [EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:jl0053) and also [Switzerland](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/104th-congress/executive-report/32/1)

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case)

>On 12 July 2010, the Swiss authorities announced that they would not extradite Polanski to the U.S. in part due to a fault in the American request for extradition. Polanski was no longer subject to house arrest, or any monitoring by Swiss authorities. In a press conference held by Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, she stated that Polanski's extradition to the U.S. was rejected, in part, because U.S. officials failed to produce certain documents, specifically ""confidential testimony from a January 2010 hearing on Mr. Polanski's original sentencing agreement.""[citation needed] According to Swiss officials, the records were required to determine if Polanski's 42-day court-ordered psychiatric evaluation at Chino State Prison constituted Polanski's whole sentence according to the now-deceased Judge Rittenband. Reasoning that if this was the correct understanding, then ""Roman Polanski would actually have already served his sentence and therefore both the proceedings on which the U.S. extradition request is founded and the request itself would have no foundation.""[99]

Also 

>On November 27, 2015, Poland decided it will not extradite Polanski to the U.S. after prosecutors declined to challenge the court's ruling, agreeing that Polanski had served his punishment and did not need to face a U.S. court again. Preparations for a movie he was working on had been stalled by the extradition request from last year.&&the usa would rather have him free than in a french jail?&&If anything, he should at least be punished for that awful mustache.&&My bet in our office pool. #Harvey 2018&&Impossible, his moral barometer is too well calibrated&&I'd love him to get taken down just for his harmful, bigoted beliefs.&&Dudes a predator.

However, there are huge loopholes that usually allow most anyone to bring up a sexual abuse lawsuit even after the statute of limitations has expired. ""


[this source](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/california-statute-of-limitations-on-sexual-abuse.html) seems mostly focused on child abuse, but it seems like there are still ways to charge people even if the statute of limitations has technically expired.

&&That cuts both ways too. A lot of our drug offenders are still in jail for drug laws that have changed. It sucks&&Wait is this real?&&> “The Rogue Cut” and is like 30 minutes longer, and makes the already great film like 10 times better. 

As a huge fan of the movie (own it on Blu Ray, rogue cut Blu Ray, and UHD), after I saw the rogue cut I totally see why they removed all scenes involving ~~the~~ Rogue.  In my opinion it detracted from the main plot, the actress seemed like she was barely even acting ( did she even have any lines?), and the movie flows better without.  I would never recommend it. Though the scene with the professor and magneto fighting the sentinel was cool.  

They made the right call cutting Rogue entirely out of the movie.

&&Whoa holy shit...I need to check this out. Is it possible to give a spoiler-free reason why it makes the movie so much better?&&Thanks for that info!

I'm not saying you, or your friends--just the majority of the population, because it's the way we see men and women. Men are viewed as the agents in our society, the doers, the aggressors. Women are the done-unto. A glance at movies, at the news, at basically any informational source will tell you that much. Even movies with strong female protagonists are far more often than not just a way to counter the 'norms' and stand out.

He served that (served 42-days, then was released), then the judge spoke about further punishments in the sentencing hearing, which led him to flee.  If true, then Polanski already served his time.

California contends that sentencing terms were not laid out in the plea agreement, so he hasn't served his time.

So, French, and then Swiss, and then Polish judges demanded that the US provide documents relating to the plea agreement, to determine whether he's served his time already or not.  California has not released those documents, which is why the extradition requests have been denied.&&Let's hope not, that's where he hides his moral barometer. &&What harmful bigoted beliefs does he hold?&&Yeah, I referenced that in another of my replies.

 https://www.wksexcrimes.com/statute-limitations-child-molestation/

>California allows perpetrators to be prosecuted within one year of when the crime was reported to police regardless of when the crime was allegedly committed. This law essentially makes the statute of limitations for child molestation moot. However, this does not mean that all allegations of PC 288 can be charged at any time. For this exception to apply, the following requirements must be met:

>* There must be independent evidence that supports the alleged victim’s claims

Guillermo del Toro here (here= on Reddit and in NYC doing all sorts of stuff around The Shape of Water). It’s been a few years since my last AMA so I’m excited to be back with you to talk movies, monsters and everything in between. Alright AMA, vamonos.



Proof: https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/937153893749919745


edit: I am being told I have to wrap it up, so- Adios amigos!  It was great being here. Now, back to real life out there!","Shape of Water almost feels like an indie film. Would you rather do more smaller films like this one or large productions?

Also, why is Doug Jones always a monster?&&Hello, Sr. del Toro. I'm a big fan

My question is: Is Ron Perlman as nice as I hope he is?

Also, do you have a favorite film of yours?&&What are some movies you're looking forward to catching up on, now that you might get some time?

Thoughts on Mad Max : Fury Road? I know you're going to be interviewing the great George Miller . &&Thanks for taking the time to do this, Guillermo! Huge fan of your movies! Any news about another collaborative project with Hideo Kojima? I was crushed when Silent Hills was cancelled. Thank you! &&Hello Guillermo,

Some of your films like Pan’s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water are made on budgets that are considerably smaller as compared to mainstream big-budgeted films, but they have the most amazing production values. Do you find the small budgets constricting or are you able to work around it?

What are the films that have inspired your work, narratively and stylistically?

PS: Would love to see a Lovecraftian horror film/TV project with your involvement.&&Hey Guillermo, what are your thoughts on the new Hellboy? 

Bonus question, what's an obscure horror film that you recommend for a horror fan who's seen almost everything?&&Hi! I got the chance to see you at the Q&A last week in NYC, I loved your insights, learning more about you and perspective in life, Thanks for sharing, it was super inspiring. For a question, did you manage to see Coco yet? &&I just wanted say thank you for Pan's Labyrinth , I don't partake in many fairy tales but Pan's Labyrinth was just perfect. I shed a tear at the end. What do you think the legacy is for the film?  &&Where do you get your inspiration for your endless monster designs?&&Tell me about death stranding &&What was the film that took you by surprise this year? And why was that the case?

P.S. Solid decision in choosing Alexandre Desplat as composer for The Shape of Water. He did a phenomenal job!&&Hey Guillermo!! Hope you're doing well. 

Do you have any advice for a 17 year old high school Junior? How were you when you were my age?&&Hi Guillermo! I still have that Cthulu sketch you drew for me on the back of my high school schedule on my wall: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPH7nnZWsAU3vdG.jpg I've now graduated from college, have a screenwriting manager and hoping to get something produced soon. Your work continues to be an inspiration to me (especially as one of my current projects is about monsters).

A few questions:

1) How is Death Stranding coming along?

2) I know you hadn't seen Evangelion when making Pacific Rim, but have you watched it since? Thoughts?

3) In the past few months there's been a lot of revelations to the public about how terrible a lot of powerful men in Hollywood have acted. Some of these revelations were semi-expected, others have been shocking from my outsider perspective (as someone whose childhood dream was to work at Pixar, hearing about Lasseter was the biggest shock to me), but it's all been depressing. How do you process all this and any thoughts on the general situation?&&Your films speak volumes to me, they are often beautiful, disturbing, or both at once. You are, in my mind, the most imaginative filmmaker working today. 

I have a few questions for you. The first: Which of your films have you been most passionate about throughout the entire creative process, and which do you think came out most true to your artistic vision?

The second: I’ve always loved the idea of you making a movie based on the works of Lovecraft. Do you think we’ll ever see that happen, and is that something you would still want to do?

Thank you so much for your time and for all of the amazing art you share with us!&&Which of your creature concepts did you enjoy developing most? Thanks!&&What advice can you give to a young mexican filmmaker trying to get funded?&&What's going on with the adaptation of Monster?

Also, how did you become friends with Hideo Kojima?&&How involved are you with Pacific Rim 2?&&[deleted]&&Years ago during the Hellboy 2 commentary, you promised if HB3 never got made, you'd tell everyone your story for it in a commentary. Do you still plan on saying what it was in a commentary or can you say it here?&&This AMA should have been bigger, what a great AMA with some really good, personal answers.&&Hey Guillermo, was wondering if you could ever shed some light on what happened with ""At the mountains of madness""? Being a huge fan of yours and and huge fan of Lovecraft that movie is like a dream come true to me!

Have a great day!&&Mr. Del Toro, 

Long time fan, when I discovered Pan’s Labyrinth I watched it every night for a week. Thank you. 

I was wondering about your notebook process. Each project gets its own book correct? Do you start at page 1 and fill it just with whatever comes to mind? Or is there a system to it? How many notebooks are you currently writing in right now? 

Thanks for all your films, they really mean a lot to me. I cannot wait for The Shape of Water. &&Now that your schedule is open...would you still be open to directing Justice League Dark?&&How was it working with the great Micheal Shannon ? What sold movie sold you on Shannon's talent as an actor? &&You mentioned it in the title, so I have to ask - what are your favourite tequilas? Also, absolutely love your films and can't wait to see The Shape of Water! :)&&What shape does water actually have?&&
Hello Del Toro, I love your movies. I'm going to see The Shape of Water on the 14th. I want to ask...

1. What was the inspiration behind The Shape of Water?

2. What are a couple of your favorite movies? Favorite this year?

3. What are you working on next?

Thanks for taking the time to answer questions!

&&Hey Guillermo. Ever since I heard you were offered the Dark Universe I've been lamenting for what could have been. Can you give us any insight on your early ideas for the style or progression of the movies you had in mind?&&What happened to your reboot of Disney's Haunted Mansion movie? I really want to see it!

When that project was first announced it seemed too soon after the Eddie Murphy movie, however now enough time has passed that it's a good time to try again.&&Do you have any advice for an aspiring film director?&&What are your thoughts on Net Neutrality?&&Hi! Just wondering how your always sunny role came to be. Love me some pappy!&&Would you consider directing anymore comic book movies? I quite enjoyed Hellboy 1 and 2!&&What is your favorite camera angle to use and why?&&Awww man! Was waiting for this one for a loong time.   
Can you tell us something about In The Mountains Of Madness?   
That was the one movie that i thought was a match made in heaven, why didn't it work out?   
Also, Silent Hills?&&Hello, Mr. Del Toro.
First of all, I’d like to thank you for the incredible work you’ve provided us. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, it is always so humbling and inspiring to see your art. I have not had the chance to see The Shape of Water yet since it has not come to my area yet, but I am eagerly anticipating it.

My question has to do with your artistic process in general, particularly your writing. When I watch your films, the way you draw from such an incredibly wide variety of influences (mythology, fairy tales, classic monster movies, gothic literature, etc.) to create something wholly unique and truthful is always breathtaking. When I write, it is hard for me to find things I’m truly interested in expressing (let alone the actual difficulty that comes with expressing them), and when I do, I can’t help but feel like I’m being extremely derivative, whether I’m consciously trying to channel something or not, and so I’m often extremely unconfident in my own writing. I apologize for how unfocused and vague this question is, and I know that this stuff isn’t supposed to be easy, but is there advice you can give me and other amateur filmmakers to help get past this feeling and be able to become better writers?&&Fuck I'm always late &&Everything I've seen about this movie seems absolutely fantastic! Where did the idea of it come from? And how did you get to be involved in it?&&Hey there, recently went to your At Home with Monsters exhibit in Toronto and really really loved it! Found it incredibly inspirational and bought myself a sketchbook afterwards to start drawing out my film ideas (although my drawings aren't yet as good as yours). 

Anyway, I have dreams of making films on quite a large scale, adventure films set in mystical worlds and ancient lands where giants roam and creatures live, akin to the works of Miyazaki. What advice would you give for a filmmaker who wants to get into the industry to make such inventive films but obviously has to somehow make smaller scale stuff first so a lower budget can support it, and how to adapt their vision? You've had quite the rise from low to high-budget filmmaking yourself so I was wondering if you'd have any advice there. Thanks! &&What is your favorite creature from cinema?&&If you had directed The Hobbit, would you have made it 1, 2, or 3 movies? How long would those movies have been?

Also, I haven't watched many Spanish-language movies but I'm definitely interested in trying some out. What are some Spanish-language movies that you would recommend?&&What is it like working with Hideo Kojima? He is my personal hero and I've always wanted to meet him. 

Thanks&&Hello! 

I heard rumours that you were hoping to open a studio on my hometown of hamilton, Ontario. 

As a film school grad hoping to get Intro the industry this really excited me. Is this true, and if so, is it in the works? 

Thanks! &&You signed the petition for Roman Polanski. Care to explain that decision?&&do you have a favorite fish? sexiest fish?&&Do you think it is even possible to make an H.P Lovecraft story into a movie at this point? Many of the stories have influenced so many movies that certain plot points are almost cliches at this point, and the way that Lovecraft tends to conjure up horror by not showing things instead of showing things doesn't seem like it would necessarily work for a movie. 

Do you think we could ever get something like At the Mountains of Madness or even Dream Quest for Unknown Kadath in movie form?&&Second season of Trollhunters please?!?!?!&&Dear Mr. Del Toro, how involved were you with the Hobbit trilogy and what would you have done differently than Peter Jackson? &&Were there any story details planned for Silent Hills? For example, was P.t. to be directly connected to the game or was P.T just displaying what Silent hills was to be like and who was the protagonist in P.T./SHs. Also who is the ""J"" character mentioned in P.T. and finally what is the bloodied bag in P.T and what does it cryptic messages mean and is it friendly? I know P.T is dead now but if you could maybe answer some things to ease a (still) grieving fan? Thank you.&&Death Stranding.  How's that coming along?&&Hello! I am a big fan and, since other people covered other your projects, I wanted to thank you for 'Trollhunters' which I love and to ask what are the plans for the universe. Another book? How many seasons? Maybe something else? Regardless, thank you for your work (art)!&&It costs what an indie costs but the scope is quite grand.   Doug is a living wire armature and a super gifted actor-  a rare combination! Hard to resist!  And we have an incredible short hand as actor/director&&I saw this article about him recently, is pretty good https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/movies/the-shape-of-water-meet-guillermo-del-toro-doug-jones.html &&Doug Jones is amazing! &&Ron is NICER than anyone can ever imagine. I love him. Anyone should.  But he is an artist, so he has his most adorable imperfections, as we all have.  THAT is the reason to love him more. &&Ron Pearlman is the shit. When my sister died, he saw what a complete wreck I was and gave me the faded jeans jacket off his back and draped it over me and told me not to give it back to him. Incredibly kind, gentle person. The jacket is comically large on me, but I still wear it occasionally. &&I worked on a tv movie that Ron Perlman was in and one time I was carrying a pop-up tent and I swung around and almost nailed him in the head. Thankfully, he dodged it and then immediately said ""whoa! You gotta warn a muthafucka!""&&It's a masterpiece. In many ways, SO kinetic, so dense, as to be digested slowly and in repeated viewings.  A God at work.&&Fun fact: 

When Guillermo del Toro was asked by a German journalist and presenter Gregor Kartsios (Rocket Beans TV) during a movie event lately about [""any spoilers for Death Stranding?""](https://youtu.be/HIngn7ZNQLY?t=1m44s) he just answered with **""What the fuck do I know, I just recorded the stuff and Kojima can do whatever he wants, he can have me fuck a donkey or something"".**

The interview footage itself wasn't released yet, but when it's on video I will post it somewhere.&&No news. Soon Kojima San will unveil his plans to the world.  I hope he doesnt make my digital Avatar suffer great horrors.&&And as a follow up, would you be able to divulge some of your ideas regarding Silent Hills?

Silent Hill is in my top 10 favorite game franchises ever and I'd love to know how the plans to invigorate the franchise would have gone. &&I’d be surprised if this wasn’t the top question here.&&I think your ambitions should always exceed the budget and ypur reach should be to deliver something that looks and feels much, much bigger.  The Shape of Water costed roughly what Pan's Labyrinth costed a decade ago (19.5M) and the scope is MUCH bigger.

FIlms that inspire me vary from time to time, but I am a big Gilliam admirer because his vision doen't diminish with his budgets.

 He is a master.

PS Me too!&&Haven't seen anything other than the still. But it's in great hands. Neil is a very gifted guy. 

I would suggest the Korean film The Wailing (2016)&&Loved Coco. Love its success. The MORE World-themed stories, the better for all us storytellers.&&It seems to keep going.  We recenmtly remastered it for the TRILOGIA box set for The Criterion Collection.

These notions clashed big time and the project derailed, even with Cameron as one of the producers and w Tom Cruise as teh star.&&No. It's random.

Like Love. Both are gentle, malleable and yet, they break through every barrier. 2) In the film, ""The Asset"" is the shape of it&&1)  It started when I was 6 years old and watching Creature From The Black Lagoon and how it broke my heart that the love story didnt end well.  I tried to get a romantic take on the tale through the 90's without finding a good way to do it. In 2011 (while starting Pac Rim) Daniel Krauz and I had bkfst in Toronto and he discussed his idea to set it in a secret government facility through the eyes of a janitor woman. This was the key. 

2) Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Greed, EL (Luis Bunuel), 8 1/2, A Serious Man, No Country for Old Men, The Fallen Idol, The Red Shoes, Taxi Driver, 2001, AN AMerican in Paris, etc, etc, etc

I am still catching up w many this year. But Ladybird moves me deeply.

But you have to preserve your purity in terms of storytelling, so it's a hardr combination to preserve.&&Should remain free.  Should not be controlled. &&The scene from the McPoyle Ponderosa Wedding where he jumps out of the chair and starts ranting about his spawn is one of my favorite things ever&&When we did HB's films (as when Blade II happened) I was doing it because these movies were scarce and -I thought- a rarity.  Today it's different.  I am different too.  I think my interest lie elsewhere.  I still like the big arena films because I essay a great deal of things that come in handy on the smaller films, and it's fun to take alternative vacations from each mode of directing.&&Not such a thing.  Although I must say that compositions in spaces work better at a lower height- the diagonals become more pronounced.&&It didn't work out because Universal wouldn't commit to a big budget, r-rated Lovecraft movie.

I then ran into him at Comicon years later and he remembered me and asked after my brother.   &&Haha hope Ron sees that you called him adorable.&&I covered the press conference for Trollhunters at NYCC and got to see/photograph Ron bringing Guillermo out a cake and singing happy birthday to him.

You could just tell that the friendship is so genuine. Ron has a gritty demeanor, but he’s very warm, honest, and would probably give someone the shirt off his back.

Thanks Guillermo for all your work and for championing passion projects.&&The few times I've met him, I'd 100% agree with ""NICER than anyone can imagine"". In Chicago, he didn't even have a line a few years ago before Sons of Anarchy got popular (I think it was Season 1 at that point) and I asked him to sign my Hellboy hand, and even though he looked slightly exasperated for a micro second (it must be SO MUCH HARDER TO SIGN than something flat), I saw him cradle that hand in the way I've seen any man cradle a baby, and with absolute care and delicacy: he signed it. The fact that I saw him sign it with such care meant that much more to me. I also had him sign a poster that day and his signature is hard to read, but on the other hand (pun intended), you can clearly make out every letter of his name on the Hellboy hand. When I gave that same hand to Mike Mignola to sign, he saw that Ron had signed it and treated it with the same respect. I'd like to think that's a bit of Ron rubbing off on other people. 

My lifetime mission is to get Guillermo and Doug Jones to sign it, then I'm going to encase that Hellboy hand into the most archival perfection known to man.&&Is that what we're doing tonight?

Dude. You were born to depict the cosmic horror/lovecraft genre. This would be phenomenal &&You have never made a bad film. My least favorite of yours was Pacific Rim and I've enjoyed it immensely&&speaking of budgets, Justice League had a budget of $600M (with marketing) and is having difficulty regaining it back.

What are your thoughts on ""visionary director"" Zack Snyder and what path he should take after having difficulties on 3 huge movies?&&Also 19.5M in 2017 is less than 19.5M in 2007. Thanks Janet & Mario!&&Wailing is on Netflix. Great horror movie. &&Whoa, Guillermo del Toro just answered my question. &&The Wailing was, to me, the most unsettling film since It Follows! Masterpiece!&&I've been trying to get my friends to watch The Wailing after seeing it last week. Please tell them to watch it! Lol&&The Wailing is one of those films where not a single scene feels out of place or overdone. Even for its length, the film feels perfectly put together. &&I hope this comment helps introduce people to The Wailing, one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.

For anyone interested: don't look it up, just watch it.  Stick with it.  It's a deeply unsettling, beautifully haunting and strangely engaging horror movie that takes its time getting you to care and then twisting the knife slowly.  This one will stay with you for a long time.&&>I would suggest the Korean film The Wailing (2016)

For those of you skimming this movie is exceptional, its one of the only horrors that are done right.&&The wailing was incredible. Haven’t seen a spiritual horror movie that good since the  exorcist &&I don't normally watch Horror films (couldn't stand the tensions and the jump scares) but The Wailing was amazing. I only watched because I saw the director's name and the ravings on reddit, not expecting his best title to date.&&The Wailing is fantastic.&&very happy to see sentiments like this echoed from a director i really respect, really looking forward to Shape of Water now&&But what did you think about the short?&&[deleted]&&Then why not join us over at r/criterion? (Hey, it was worth a shot.)&&The *Pan's Labyrinth* Criterion remaster looks amazing!  The new color grading gives the picture a breath of fresh air, and the 35mm film really gets to flaunt it's sharpness and fine granularity.  I love that it has both the original 5.1 surround mix and the alternative 7.1 surround mix for us 8-channel viewers!

Criterion all the way!  Keep an eye out for their new *The Passion of Joan of Arc* release; that new 4K master is truly something else.

Thanks for continuing to do what you do!&&For the uninitiated, the Criterion collection includes tons of classic art house movies, such as the masterpieces Armageddon and The Rock by true movie auteur Michael Bay&&What do you think of Junji And HR Giger?&&Not Abe Sapien?&&I just want to say, you do it right. I see so many movies today where the monsters or creatures are just so bland and unimaginative. Every single movie you make, you create unique and timeless creatures. The Troll Market scene is one of my all time favourites, I could just watch that in wonder for hours.

Argh its frustrating to know you guys were in my own backyard so recently lol&&>Kojima San scanned my body over an entire day

That, and the outtake from Blade II calling the villain ""this Michael Bolton-looking mofo"".  

Everything that comes from him is charming and interesting.  &&I have to constantly remind myself that the creators I look up to didn't just shoot out of the womb and start doing amazing stuff. 

Hearing that Guillermo del Toro took until he was 30 to have things pop into place too, that helps a lot.&&Thats what i was looking for and didnt know. Ty for this words&&As someone currently in that age group and struggling with some issues this was very great to hear. Thanks Guillermo.&&It’d look great in the kitchen!&&If you put a black piece of paper behind it, that will help to hide the text on the back.  
Edit: Please don't use glue! My archivist sensibilities implore you. Thanks.&&Seems Del Toro had limited time and stopped answering before he got to mine, but if he has time later...

Though at least he answered my first question in response to other people (he has no clue what's happening, just had his body scanned for the game and keeps getting presents in the mail from Kojima).&&Pacific Rim's main inspirations were older mecha anime and kaiju films that inspired Eva. Travis Beacham saw EVA while making Pacific Rim and took some inspiration but Del Toro himself said he hadn't watched it.&&The main inspiration was that on a foggy day Sydney Oprah house looks like a Kaiju attacking.&&What is evangalion? I YouTubed it and found an anime. Is that it?&&Give us some HP Lovecraft movies, please!!!!!

You are the only one who I would trust to do it. With your storytelling capabilities and the creatures you create, you are perfect for the job.&&Thank you so much for answering! You’re an inspiration and I can’t wait to see The Shape of Water!&&Devil's backbone is incredible, one of my favorites.&&Hellboy 2 felt like how I wanted Star Wars to feel. I really felt like I had visited another world.&&If you can explain it, what attracts you to the idea of having protagonists and so many major character being something other than human?&&Holy shit this feels like a dream, thank you for answering! &&I've honestly been searching for an answer on the adaptation of Monster for years since it was announced, last I heard was it had been scrapped. So what does being developed mean, is it currently being worked on? written? how many years away! I'm hoping it'll be the first great anime adaptation to ever exist :)&&Casting Johan and Anna seems like it would be one of the toughest parts of adapting it to live action.&&I am so happy to hear this!  I was thrilled to read an article a couple of years ago that said you were considering adapting Monster. but hadn't heard anything about it since.

That is definitely in my top 3 favorite anime series and I think you'll do an amazing job with it!&&What?!? Are you doing an adaptation for Monster (the anime)? Im getting major goosebumps right now. Holy shit.&&I'm very excited for it despite all the gloom that the internet portrays. &&I absolutely loved Pacific Rim. It's legitimately the only film I've ever gasped out loud while watching in theatre's.

""It has wings?!""&&I'm sincerely stoked for Shape of Water, but I think that stepping away from PR was a mistake (for us). What I've seen so far in trailers looks pretty comical and completely different in style, tone and animation from the first movie, which was in my opinion pretty much perfect. I just hope I won't have to be saying: ""Boy, that should have never been made""... :(&&The Neil Marshall reboot probably kills any chance of it happening, though.&&With the recent successes of several R rated movies I'm sure movie studios would be more open to the idea again. God I want to see this made!&&Next time you decide to pitch that project, please tell whichever execs that I really want to see it. You can mention my reddit name and everything.&&Thank you for not budging at least. Too many times people compromise on their vision and the movie loses it's soul. I think something like ""At The Mountains of Madness"" wouldn't be as great as it could without being R-rated.&&Keeping trying, if you can! I've been dying for a proper Lovecraft adaptation to hit the big screens, and there's no one I'd rather have at the helm than you. &&>The budget was big ($150M) and I insisted on it being ""R"" rated.

Thank you for maintaining the ""R"" rating of your movie despite opposition.

Does that include marketing?

Man fuck Bitcoin, I would've put all my money into shorting DC Live action movies, they will never learn their lesson.&&From what i heard it's production budget was around 300 million, marketing costs are never included in the production budget listings though, with that in mind the film could easily have costed the studio 600 million like you said BUT you need to separate the production budget vs marketing costs because usually noone outside the company knows how much a movie costs to market.

Personally i think the marketing cost is more around 150-200 million with a movie this size (given that you usually say that you double the cost with the marketing on blockbusters, and blockbusters today are usually around the 200m mark and not 300m, and marketing costs don't magically go up just because it is an unusually expensive movie to make.&&> Justice League had a budget of $600M

I watched it and thought it was ok. Not that scary for a horror movie. &&There's a lot of deadpan comedy in that with the police character, which seems to be a common theme in Korean cinema.

>**Can you give me an update on the status of 'Monster' project for HBO?**

>**Guillermo del Toro:** We are going to other companies to pitch it and see if anyone wants to do it. We finished writing a couple of the episodes, and so we have a sampler. We're going to go and see what happens with that, but very likely that will happen somewhere next year.

>**It's still at HBO?**

>**Guillermo del Toro:** No, it's out of HBO, and now we're going to take it to other places but it's not active active until we pitch it.&&Monster...like the anime?&&I think that the solution is to have them be played by identical twin women. Johan's actress can be made to look more masculine with makeup and such and her voice can be altered. Johan's voice wasn't very deep in the sub or the dub, so it wouldn't need to be changed too much.

The wailing. US &&Are you using the U.S Netflix?it's definitely there, I'm not sure about the other regions though.&&So I've heard. I'm definitely watching it tonight! Big fan of Korean horror flicks.&&It's on Netflix UK. There should be some decent subtitles around.&&I'll have to give it another shot. 

I tried watching it a few weeks back, and there was in fact a lot of wailing. Between that and the bumbling cop/dad, I just got annoyed and stopped watching. Perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood.&&The most enjoyable aspect of the movie was that I simply didn't know what was going to happen next. As a horror fan, after consuming so much western horror you basically become familiarized with the common tropes used - this is a zombie flick, exorcism, ghost, etc, and you can pretty much guess amongst several possibilities what the ending might be.

I didn't know anything about shamanism coming into this so that was refreshing. And I love how Korean directors fuse zany comedic situations with serious moments on the turn of a dime, along with the bumbling detective/cop trope. When you couple that with how the movie spent a year on the editing floor, for most of the movie (and even after the end) the viewer goes through a similar experience as the cop protagonist - suspicion, anger, relief, confusion, and doubt. I never knew where the story was heading, or whether No Name or the Japanese man and mudang were the evil doers, especially in the frenzied climax where the mudang was performing the exorcism on the girl, where three different scenes are edited to unfold at once. 

Another point I appreciated was how unobtrusive the music was. To compare it to another horror I saw recently, ""It,"" I couldn't immerse myself in the movie because so many of the scenes had upbeat music pounding for the happy moments and scary music playing for the reverse. It's nice to watch something that  doesn't shove what you're supposed to be feeling down your throat.

Tldr: refreshing asian horror, well edited, didn't know what was coming next, and threw your emotions into a rollercoaster &&Everytime I read about Silent Hills I get more upset. Seriously.

Not only was the camera work good, but the fact it was actually full of color.&&This is correct. Interesting tidbit, the Abe Sapien we saw in Hellboy is largely Guillermo’s take on the character - Mike Mignola’s original character is much different. The psychic powers, affinity for rotten eggs, and genteel nature don’t exist in the comic. Those things were all Guillermo.  
The framework for the Amphibian Man was based on the Black Lagoon creature, but lots of additions as far as personality and physicality come from Guillermo - I wouldn’t call them as being taken from Abe for the reasons I listed.&&I've met him twice briefly and he's a bit off-putting but came a cross as a decent guy.

One thing led to another and my circumstances flipped around, and now I have a pretty nice life, and I'm happy. For the past couple of years I've dealt with not knowing what to do with my life, but a couple months ago I sat down and really thought about it. I came up with a step-by-step process of what I want to do with my future, and at the moment I am working towards that goal. 

If it means anything, I believe that your life will get better, just like mine did.&&I dunno. But Guillermo was real, and i'm a Flamingo. So that's 2 out of 4. Are you really a Staypuft Michelin Man?&&I agree. It's too bad that HBO passed. It's such an amazing material...&&To be fair, the Monster anime was a panel-for-panel adaptation of the manga. 

If you've seen the anime, you've read the manga.&&Man... I wish it could have some special, unique, and amazing story. I really do, it would make me so happy. But it just...doesn't. Monsters show up. Humanity bands together and builds giant mechs. Monsters get stomped. That's the whole movie. There's no amazing authentic dialogue, there's no Dumbledore-level devastating deaths, it's just...a really good action movie.

I will give the movie a ton of credit for skipping a big romantic story outside of a bit of flirting, but that's pretty much the only out-of-the-ordinary thing PR does, story-wise.

What makes the movie brilliant is the art direction, sets, Kaiju and Jaeger designs, and the fight choreography. The worldbuilding is also astounding. I love Pacific Rim. It's my favorite action movie by miles. But the story is a basic bitch, there's sadly no denying it.

&&Tbh it was ok in the 1st one but they took it to absurd levels as the series follows.&&I got to see Michael Shannon at the premiere of the shape of water and was in the audience for a Q&A afterwards. Before the movie he signed autographs and did some red carpet interviews. From what I saw he seems uninterested in signing autographs/interacting with fans/answering press questions but didn't come off as a dick. He's definitely not a people person or social butterfly though. Michael Stuhlbarg (who plays the scientist in the movie) was also there and is the complete opposite socially... he loves talking to everyone and interacting with fans. During the Q&A michael shannon seemed a lot more energetic though, seems like he loves acting itself way more than all of the other stuff that's part of the job, and it's really apparent.&&Tres Generaciones Anejo and Don Julio Blanco are my go-to's. &&I SHALL TURN YOUR FLESH INTO MY LIVING WIRE ARMATURE&&/r/consensualplatonicmanhugs&&And he whispers in your ear, ""Raaadiator"".&&""I'm guessing this one had a bunny but not anymore""&&I'm writing all of this down!&&Goon-guhs.&&What is wrong with your faaaaaaace?&&Put nanobots in it and its perfect! &&But goddamn if MGS3 isn't a masterpiece &&In 2010 my dorm mate and I were on omegle to pass the time.

Edit: Thank you for the gold!&&A lot of people don't seem to understand this but Lucas got 2 billion dollars worth of Disney shares, which means that a part of profits from SW goes to Lucas.&&That's not how this works.  
     That's not how any of this works. &&[deleted]&&Lucas donated all of his proceeds towards building a Star Wars museum and sold not to the highest bidder, but to his friends (Kathleen Kennedy used to work for Spielberg, already had a relationship with Lucas etc.) Dude did not sell Lucasarts to make (more) money&&Lucas sold for about a third of what it should have been sold for. Disney will have a decade of predictable billion dollar movies, plus merchandising and cross branding at their parks. &&I wonder how long they can keep the gravy train rolling, before Star Wars fatigue sets in? I feel like at some point they’ll have to take a few years off to get the anticipation flowing again.&&*In movie box office, but not in movie profit.

Also, they probably made those four billion back in toy sales since then, so it definitely already paid off for them.

EDIT: a word (thanks u/santaliqueur)&&Toys make more money than the movies do&&meh. They remade that 4 billion easily awhile back just on merchandise.&&They probably crossed that line several times on toys and merchandise alone ... &&Disney: ""That was easy""&&It'll be interesting to see the first BO bomb for a Disney's produced SW film&&Can someone explained how Lucas was paid? Was it as simple as Disney handing him a $4B check?&&I’d like to point out I’m still not buying a Nissan Rogue. &&But if George Lucas had stuck all that $4 billion in bitcoin, he'd now have $5345 billion or 1336 times what he was paid. Checkmate, atheists.&&And through the magic of Hollywood accounting the film's lost money so tax breaks all around.&&I remember when I went to Anaheim, Disneyland and walking around Tomorrowland and just watching the Star Wars shop being flooded with people every single day.

If anything Disney got a fucking garage sale bargain. Also, gross vs net, etc. HR is being very lazy with this article.&&But the real profit is in the licensing.

You think Disney is gonna pay 4 billion and not get a huge return? How about when they announced a Star Wars film every year for, forever? Merchandize? What about costs?

Seriously, this whole thing is a farce&&This will be lost in oblivion, but a friend who is in the industry had a good way of explaining: blockbuster movies are just long commercials for all the products surrounding the franchise.

&&Well he gets an increase in the value of shares and any dividends issued by Disney, some of which is fueled by Star Wars, but he gets none of the profits directly. &&They could have said “box office grosses for Star Wars stuff (ignoring costs) is now a bigger number than Lucasfilm’s purchase cost for Disney (ignoring profits)” but then they would have missed some sweet karma (and clicks).&&The article even includes this after their own click bait headline.

>It doesn’t, of course, account for the hundreds of millions spent to produce and market the trio of films. Conversely, the box-office milestone doesn't include lucrative ancillary revenue streams, merchandising sales or theme park attractions.&&Welcome to modern news headlines where the sentences are made up and the words don’t matter &&They are looking at ticket sales and ignoring the rest of it... like my niece's god damned R2D2 waffle maker lol &&“MERCHANDISING!!” - Mel Brooks&&They also did not include the revenues from merchandising sales , theme park attraction, and ancillary revenues&&Or that theaters do get some of the ticket money. Box office gross is an easy measure of popularity, but not at all useful on it's own for determining profitability.&&They're acknowledging that the ticket sales of TFA, R1 and TLJ have surpassed the 4.1 billion that Lucas sold the IP for.

That's it.  It even specifically says in the article like 2 sentences in that the number doesn't include the cost of making/marketing the films nor does it include the massive amount of money they make from merchandising.

It's simply a ""hey, here's a cool thing about Star Wars"".&&Yeah he still made a  great deal of money (with half of it being in stock that can continue to rise) and at the same time he sold it to who he believed would be best suited to grow the Star Wars brand and image in a positive light.&&Haven’t ever heard of that. Is it in California?&&Pretty sure Lucas just wanted to be free of it. Everyone knew at the time it was too little but he really became a pariah to his own fanbase. I just think he was tired of being the villain. It's almost as if that money was so dirty to him he couldn't even keep it.

Let someone else run his franchise into the ground and maybe people might stop to acknowledge the parts he did well.

He is plenty rich and probably doesn't lose any sleep over the amount he got.&&If Candy Crush was worth $8 billion, there is no way Star Wars was only worth $4 billion. &&$4B is plenty for a franchise everyone thought he was ruining.  There was never any doubt of the money making potential, but no one thought Lucas had the potential to make good movies.  The deal was best for both parties, especially at that price.&&When you -a single person- are making literal **billions** off selling your IP that you've long since hated and have gotten nothing but shit on for decades about, who cares how many billions it is?&&[deleted]&&Half of the $4 billion was Disney stock, so his ""take"" from the sale is growing with every positive quarter Disney reports. &&It was never about the money. He was sick of being tied down by Star Wars. He even said in an interview afterwards that his primary motivation for selling the franchise was that he wanted to make other movies and work on independent projects but the shadow of Star Wars followed him everywhere.

It's also worth noting that he has said in multiple interviews after the deal was signed that he regretted this decision immediately because he no longer had control over the direction of the story or how the brand was marketed. And if you've been paying attention since then, you can probably understand why Lucas would be upset with the way Disney made a shameless move to exploit the franchise he had worked for more than three decades to carefully protect against exactly the sort of predatory marketing that we saw immediately after they picked up the franchise.&&Sure. Reports say Alien sequels (fox properties) are currently on hold. I'm sure Disney has a bunch of franchises they wont invest on for a few years. They will come back to fill voids when other currently popular franchises will show signs of exhaustion.&&[deleted]&&fatigue will set in only if Disney can't get their standalone stories out of the OT era. There are only so many gaps you can fill in before people want to see new stories with new characters and settings. I hope Obi Wan is the last OT era standalone they do. I'd be fine with sequel trilogy and prequel era but obviously am ready for new stuff (I still think RJ's new trilogy is going to kick ass)&&It's been nearly 10 years since Iron Man came out, and Disney seems to be going in a similar production direction to those movies. It seems reasonable to say that we won't hit Star Wars fatigue until 2025 at the earliest.

Alternatively, there have been 17 MCU movies so far. If they restrain themselves to 1 Star Wars film per year, they could probably sustain it until at least 2032.

Both of those estimates are based on the assumption that we are seeing MCU fatigue and that the superhero bubble will burst in the next year or so, which we have no real reason to believe. Also, one film per year is likely FAR less fatigue inducing than the two+ per year that the MCU is doing.&&The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rolling since 2008 without any sign of slowing down, at a rate of 2 movies per year. Star Wars is so far only rocking one release every 12 months so there's no reason to expect any significant changes in demand any time soon, but who's to say?&&It took me two weeks to see TLJ because I felt *obligated* to see it, so I've already hit that spot

But I feel like my saturation point is lower than others, so YMMV&&The last movie was so bad I expect a healthy % of fans to fall off. Not from fatigue so much as from bad story telling.&&Don’t forget general licensing. People like to laugh at the Star Wars oranges that get posted here, but keep in mind Disney isn’t packaging oranges a company is paying Disney to put their logo on the package. &&Especially with having SW merch at their theme parks.&&*Emperor Mouse will be most pleased*!&&I think Star Wars is too popular a brand for one of them to actually bomb. Underperform, sure, but bomb? I think they'd have to release several really terrible movies in a row and drag the quality of the franchise into the dirt before a Star Wars film release faced the possibility of bombing.&&I don't think Solo is going to bomb but I think it will for sure under perform. I have yet to meet a Star Wars fan who is truly excited for it. Most people want to see it out of morbid curiosity because it was such a train wreck of a production. &&so next year&&credits will do fine&&Money and stock options are usually how these deals are done &&He got 2 billion cash and 2 billion stock options. Which the stock is worth even more today so he is profiting as time goes on.&&Bitcoin&&Disney issued roughly 37 million shares and made a cash payment of $2.2 million.&&I had the lovely experience of driving a Nissan Rogue as a rental recently. What an enormous piece of shit. &&Try cashing it out mind&&I fully agree with this. Its like Abrams set all the pins and Rian just came in and kicked them all down, yelling, ""This is dumb! lets do it my way!""

I liked both movies but they dont line up. TFA was classic Star Wars, TLJ is a deconstruction of classic Star Wars. Theyre polar opposites.&&I think that was the intent.  They deliberately made 7 a very safe movie so that the could buy good will from the fans after the backlash toward the prequels.  The result was a movie that was a bit too similar to 4.  That left them with a choice: have 8 and 9 be a bit too similar to 5 and 6, or have 8 totally throw everything for a loop in the interests of telling a more original story with the trilogy.  

If you look closely the continuity has been preserved, but its been intentionally obscured for the sake of unpredictability. &&It's hilarious to me that people just accepted a canonical reset. The entire struggle of the OT, all for nothing. In fact characters are worse off now than they were before. Watching the OT with these new films in mind feels so hollow now because you know that nothing matters.

The Thrawn books felt like actual sequels, building off the concepts and groundwork set in the OT, but this feels like a cynical reboot disguised as a sequel (because, surprise, it is).&&:(&&I mean they weren't going to live forever anyway&&Maybe he’s born with it?&&The Kylo Ren concept and the word ""body"" shouldn't be used in the same sentece for at least one decade.&&Everyone who joins the dark side has great hair: Kylo, Ani, Jar Jar...&&> amazing body

Isn't 'ignoring costs' redundant after already saying 'grosses'?&&Let's just put the profitability of Star Wars for Disney into perspective.   If Kathleen Kennedy is heating her 300 bedroom home by burning Thousand Dollar bills and living in the northern Alaskan wastes, well..... the greedy bastards who sit on the Disney board of directors are still not complaining. 

Same goes for Kevin Feige's program of basting wads of cash directly into the Sun.  At the end of the budget year, Disney is still making shit loads of money.  &&It makes me wonder if this is how they justified butchering things, like LucasArts.&&And finding out those numbers would take longer than 10 minutes that has been allocated for this in-depth investigative report by the 20-something minimum wage journalist.

&&Merchandising is an enormous part of Star Wars' profitability.  I wouldn't be surprised if that alone meets or exceeds box office earnings.&&And Star Wars Land, which opens next year, is going to be a huge draw at the parks.&&the Star Wars museum is still a work in progress, and the current locale is So Cal.&&It will be in Exposition Park in Los Angeles. Here are the renderings:

https://la.curbed.com/2017/5/4/15551724/george-lucas-museum-la-renderings&&Hell, he donated a metric fuck ton of money already and, in fact, has so much fuck you money, he's building low income housing on his own land to spite his neighbors. &&If I recall he gave most of the money away. I don't think you're far off. &&> Pretty sure Lucas just wanted to be free of it.

So I'm sure no one will believe this story (though I have a photo) but I met George Lucas at NoMi in Chicago in 2012, he owns a place in the Park Hyatt (plenty of news stories confirm this.) 

Anyway it was an odd hour and we were literally the only two tables in the restaurant and he was talking to the other person he was with and I could hear their entire conversation. The summary of it was the he sold because he is getting old and wanted to make sure the franchise was in good hands in case he suddenly passes. He even said ""what if my jet goes down one day?"". He didn't want an estate war over the brand. He said he sold it to Disney because they are essentially the best at maintaining franchises and brands.

And for what it's worth he didn't care about the money, he donated ""the majority"" of the proceeds to charity. &&One positive thing that I can say about TLJ and TFA is that they do make you appreciate that the Prequels, while poorly written, flatly acted and having production value that makes everything look sterile, plastic and lifeless, actually have consistent and more coherent storylines and character arcs.&&But if candy crush costs are 1.0% of revenue, and Star Wars costs are 60-70% of revenue it is easy to understand.&&> Candy Crush was worth $8 billion

1. This was for King, the producer of Candy Crush, and not just for the rights to produce new Candy Crush games. The price included everything the company owned, i.e. all other games, rights, operations... so it isn't really comparable. Disney still had to produce those new movies, Candy Crush is an already existing game.

2. It was actually 7 billion (IPO).

3. They made 2 billion in revenue each year and were growing quite fast, so 7 billion wasn't that crazy (less than 4x of revenue). 

4. Profit margins are quite important. Candy Crush is quite low cost / low risk relative to producing and marketing a movie. I think King used to make like 600 million profit each year.&&Jesus TIL candy crush is worth a shit ton of $. That's ridiculous . &&Sure, but who the fuck is going to turn down $4 billion? It doesn't fucking matter how much you get, it's already billions. You're never gonna spend all of it anyway.&&For real, if I was making something and getting (some) shit for it, I'd gladly leave it in other hands and take $4b

Jesus Christ that's a lot of money.&&$4 billion was NOTHING at all when you consider that it also gave Disney the merchandising revenue. Merchandise from one year alone will generate more revenue than that $4 billion price tag.&&I agree that it was smart for both sides but the price is off. If someone says you will get an asset that will bring back a billion in profit per year (the estimated profit being 700 million per film plus merchandising, park benefits etc. ) you would expect an 8-10 time multiple- meaning 8-10 billion on the low end.&&I'm still waiting for *Steamboat Willie vs. Predator*.&&Wasnt Scott doing Prometheus 3: ""now this is the true prequel""?

I love the Alienverse, but the only good media it produced on the last 30 years was the Alien: Isolation game&&I would argue that Marvel is in a better position because they have several interesting characters that are basically demigods. Each of the Avengers have enough content to fill multiple movies. 

How many more side movies can Disney branch off of the main 9 films? Fans will show up for a Han Solo film and an Obi Wan film. Who else can carry a movie?

I would personally like to see some movies about the old republic, but Im not sure others feel the same. &&> the superhero bubble will burst in the next year or so, which we have no real reason to believe.

I really do wonder what will happen after Infinity War Part II/Avengers 4/whatever they end up calling it. That movie is THE event for superhero films and i'd argue that will be the peak of the superhero genre. 

But even then, just because the next wave of movies may not be as big a hit, there's no reason they stop being profitable. I don't think the superhero movie should worry until they end up grossing less than half a billion. That's probably when it's time to give them a break but who knows when that will be. With properties like Fantastic 4 and the X-Men now back at Marvel I can see that adding some additional hype after Phase 3.&&The only thing is, SW films (to date) have a narrower “flavor profile,” for lack of a better term, than Marvel films. Even including Rogue One, they’re space-set action adventure films with a side of comic relief. Whereas the Marvel movie palette is broader, with some straight-up comedies like GotG and Ragnarok to provide variety.

Or hell, I loved Rogue 1, some more stuff that doesn't focus on Jedi would be great. 

All pipe dreams but still&&You don’t want to see a JarJar Binks film?&&>Who else can carry a movie?

Well Rian Johnson just got his own trilogy set in the Star Wars universe, so my bet is on something possibly new (something a little closer to the original Star Wars in tone, where it's a squadron of fly boys), but that's not to say there aren't a few characters left on the table:

- Vader film between 3 and 4 where he hunts remaining Jedi

- Han as you said

- Obi Wan as you said

- A young Qui Gon film

- A young Yoda film

- Darth Maul since by Disney canon he is alive

- Boba Fett if they go with the ""he flew out of the sarlacc"" stories

- Cad Bane (or really any Bounty Hunter film) would be awesome

- Old Republic which could consist of any number of characters

- Any character that they have developed on the cartoon shows they currently have. By the time they reach this level of the list, you can bet those kids will be adults or at least teenagers.


And the **real kicker** is in each one of those films, they have the opportunity to build the universe and establish more characters.

And they only need one of those films to land a solid original ""Break out"" character, which could potentially get more movies surrounding them.

Not to mention the old EU was pretty comprehensive, they can cherry pick a few stories.&&If I see a movie about Revan in my lifetime then I will die happy. It's a shame the greater public doesn't know much about the Old Republic stuff, because it's seriously awesome. &&Lmao people said the same thing about Ant Man.

They have pre prequel legends, they have prequel stories, clone wars stories, they have rebel stories in the star wars era, they have post main series saga with the destabilized empire and rise of the first order and they'll have stuff after the sequel saga ends. That doesn't even include random shit like boba fett and the bounty hunters.&&I could definitely see them making reboots of these franchises, cycling them through over time and keeping it up ad infinitum. Wait like 5-10 years and people will be ready for another version of Iron Man, I'm sure. Not to mention the potential for gimmicky one-shots, there are all kinds of weird story lines in the comics after all. Like, who is to say they won't do Planet Hulk and/or World War Hulk somewhere down the line?&&They already have a Spider-Man sequel and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 planned for after The second infinity war movie. Pretty sure they’re going to keep going with it&&This is something they will definitely have to change. They need to create different flavored stories for Star Wars if they want to keep going. &&I had no interest in seeing Rogue One, but went because it was Star Wars and I like going to the movies. I loved it. Maybe those tempered expectations made the movie more enjoyable for me. 

I was so pumped for TFA and, to me, it delivered. But that was 10+ years of no Star Wars movies and 30+ years of waiting for a sequel to the original trilogy. I had high hopes for TLJ, and though I liked it, it wasn't up to the hype I created for it in my mind. Not a bad movie to me, just over-hyped by me.  &&It's weird too; Han Solo? Probably my favorite character of all time but I... have next to zero interest in that movie. I think part of it is the fans are getting a little tired of Disney retreading the same ground over and over. That and we're probably pretty gunshy about the Solo movie in particular after a troubled production, the feeling of ""Disney-fication"" of Star Wars in ways that don't fit thematically and all that.&&The trailer will make or break it. If Aldon Erhenreich doesn’t convince people he’s Han Solo in the trailer the movie will not do that good.&&let us not forget that Rogue One, while it did have extensive re shoots, the director was not fired and the entire movie was not re shot. It is rumored that Ron Howard has basically re shot the whole thing. I am sure though if any of the Lord and Miller stuff appears in the film, you will be able to tell that it is Lord and Miller. I don't think any of their footage will show up personally.&&Nah. I think it'll do respectable Marvel numbers, but not monster Star Wars numbers.

It seems the local government is trying stop him though.&&Clap. Clap. Clap.&&For me, all three of the Disney films fall into the mindless category for various reasons.

TFA was the best of the three.  It started really well, and then spiraled downward into nostalgia oblivion.

Rogue One was an interesting idea, but the main character is barely developed, and her sudden switch of allegiance feels very contrived.  The rest of the cast is just there.  They aren't even characters, but caricatures.  We learn next to nothing about them, so how am I supposed to care when they die?

It was a very clever idea to suggest that the Death Star had its weakness built into it on purpose as revenge by the builder, but that wasn't enough to make up for the general nihilistic tone.

TLJ is schizophrenic.  It can't decide if it wants to celebrate the past or shit all over it.  Whether to answer questions from TFA or just ignore them.  In the end, it says nothing except fuck you, pay me.
&&Ok you can shit on the prequels all you want but my man Ewan as Obi-Wan killed it, and he also definitely had a character arc. &&Didn't know that, but it makes sense.

In the purchase of large parts of Fox entertainment they just bought all fox sports regional sports stations. The goal being trying to pivot from a national type broadcast to being a more regional sports business. For example lets say your favorite football team is the dolphins favorite baseball team is the yankees and favorite basketball team is the warriors they theoretically could tailor your sportscenter experience to in depth highlights and analysis strictly for those teams. The problem they ran into is people dont need to watch highlight shows like sportscenter anymore you can just get the highlights on your smartphone but a tailored experience could bring people back.&&no way disney does an obi wan film without ewan mcgregor, especially given that he's expressed interest in reprising the role. if disney does an obi wan film without ewan mcgregor, i'm never watching star wars again&&Hello there.&&*Disney doesn't cast Ewan McGregor in the Obi-Wan movie*

Stormtrooper FN-2187 found himself trapped at the end of a one-way hallway on Starkiller while on sanitation duty. This in and of itself would not be so bad, except that there was danger fast approaching in the form of who he recognized as the First Order’s resident spitfire, Kylo Ren.

FN-2187 had not yet seen Ren or his lightsaber before, but he recognized both the moment he saw him stomping down the hallway. FN-2187 used to think that Nines was laying it on thick when he described Ren’s cataclysmic temper tantrums. He could see at that moment that there was no need for exaggeration. With the largest swipes of his blazing lightsaber, Ren roared at the walls like they had said something to personally offend him. The smell of melting durasteel filled the hall.

FN-2187 stopped mopping the floor and stared a bit in awe before the realization set in that he was right in the way of Ren’s warpath. Anyone else that may have been in the hall earlier had the sense to clear out. He dropped his mop and turned to run before belatedly remembering that Ren was coming from the only exit. FN-2187 turned back, feeling the all-too-familiar sweat start to build up on his forehead beneath his helmet. As if to emphasize the stormtrooper’s doom, one of the wild lightsaber swipes hit the lights. The far dimmer emergency lights kicked in, but they only served to emphasize the ghoulishness of Ren’s approaching figure.

There was only one choice. FN-2187 set his jaw. He would have to run and try to dodge by Ren. He waited until Ren got close, then made a break for it.

His plan—though it was almost too simple to be called that—fell through spectacularly. For, in his haste, he had forgotten about the area he had just mopped. FN-2187 only had time to let out a sharp, startled “Whoa!” as he slipped on the wet floor and then face-planted against the chest of the master of the Knights of Ren. Before he could fall the rest of the way, Ren dropped his lightsaber and caught him by his biceps. The lightsaber dropped to the ground with a clunk and hiss as it deactivated.

FN-2187 started sweating even more then and his breathing bordered on hyperventilating. Dead. He was dead and he had not even seen battle yet. To his surprise, though, Ren did not throttle him right then and there. As a matter of fact, if FN-2187 had to best describe the way in which Ren wrapped his arms around him and clasped him against his black-clothed body in the next moment, he would say he was hugging him.

“U-uh. Lord Ren, sir?”

Crushed as he was against his superior officer, FN-2187 could plainly see the frayed quality of Ren’s woven capelet with far more clarity than he ever wanted to. He attempted to extricate himself from Ren’s hold, only to have Ren more or less crush him and lift him a few inches off the ground. FN-2187’s air supply lessened as the already restricting armor cut further into his body. He ended up face-to-face with Ren’s inscrutable helmet.

“Be silent and don’t struggle if you value your life,” Ren said, then added, as if to validate what he was doing, “I need this.”

Needed what? A bunch of plastoid stormtrooper armor digging into him through his cloth robes?

In an attempt at appeasing him, FN-2187 nodded. Mercifully, Ren set him down, making FN-2187 realize in the process how kriffing tall he was.

As if nothing had occurred, Ren went back to hugging him with the same fervor as before. FN-2187 tried to decide what to do with his hands, feeling awkward with his arms dangling at his sides. After much debate, he ended up settling them on either side of Ren at the hips, ready to pull back at a moment’s notice.

“Don’t just do it halfway, trooper.”

And so FN-2187 ended up wrapping his arms completely around Kylo Ren’s waist. They stood like that for a while. Ren’s mask did not pick up the sound of his breathing, but FN-2187 could see the rise and fall of his broad chest right in front of his visor. It started out in harsh, quick swells with each breath, a testament to his residual anger and exertion from going berserk with his lightsaber, but slowly they became less pronounced and even as Ren relaxed.

The trooper’s stomach turned over when Ren leaned down, adjusting his position to tuck his head over FN-2187’s shoulder. Startled, he turned to look. The resulting clack of their helmets and Ren’s reprimanding snarl had him looking forward again, this time over Ren’s shoulder. He stared down the corridor, praying that no one important happened along and saw his predicament. The only witness to the spectacle ended up being a mouse droid working on a maintenance panel not three feet from them, who FN-2187 decided he trusted to keep a secret.

Meanwhile, Ren used his fingers to investigate the slots between the pieces of FN-2187’s armor where the body glove stood out. FN-2187 concentrated on trying not to flinch or giggle when Ren hit on the ticklish spots. Best not to chance that Ren would think he was laughing at him.

Maybe it was one of Ren’s mind tricks, but the longer the hug went on the more comfortable with the awkward and highly unprofessional situation FN-2187 became. He settled further into Ren’s hold until he was all but boneless. The stormtrooper ranks did not offer many opportunities for public displays of affection beyond the occasional high-five or congratulatory punch on the shoulder. Although it was with Kylo Ren, FN-2187 could appreciate affectionate physical contact like this. It was one of the few times in his life he could remember receiving it.

“The Supreme Leader does not believe me ready to complete my training,” Ren said suddenly.

Even with the voice scrambler, FN-2187 could hear the sulky quality to Ren’s voice. That explained what he had been upset about, then, but FN-2187 was not sure that that explanation justified the level of havoc Ren had wreaked on his workstation.

In a misguided attempt at comfort, FN-2187 said, “I’m sure you’ll be ready someday—”

“I do not recall giving you permission to speak,” Ren snapped. “That aside… even you, a lowly stormtrooper, do not think that I’m ready.”

FN-2187 bit the inside of his cheek. Ren pulled his head back and stared him down for a moment. FN-2187 imagined he was probably glaring at him. It did not help that his helmet gave him a perma-angry look.

The hug ended in a less climactic way than it began. Ren shoved him away and turned on his heel to leave. His dropped lightsaber soared to his outstretched hand. FN-2187, after a moment spent gawking at his first experience with the Force, tried to muster up something to say.

“I’m glad you were just hugging me and not squeezing me to death”? “You’re really warm, you know, I could feel it through my gloves”? Nothing he came up with seemed appropriate, so he let Ren keep walking. Oddly enough, though, Ren paused for a moment, back to FN-2187, and said something himself.

“Thank you.”

FN-2187 blinked.

“I may be requiring your services again soon,” Ren said, then continued on his way.

Services? He made it sound like the hug had been a transaction. Or something incredibly sexual. Nevertheless, FN-2187 felt a small thrill at the idea of doing it again.

As soon as Ren was out of sight, FN-2187 uncrossed his arms from around himself, realizing with a twinge of embarrassment that it was an attempt to replicate the gesture from the enigmatic knight. The mouse droid, who had long since finished with its work, tittered in what FN-2187 could only assume was a mocking fashion.

“Oh, shut up,” FN-2187 grumbled, picking up his discarded mop and minding the area he had slipped on earlier.

He went back to work, wondering whether or not clean floors would matter next to the wrecked walls.

&&Lmfao. I pushed air out my nose quickly.
&&You see his lightsaber? Pretty cool, right?&&It makes sense considering a lot of their stuff comes locally from Florida.&&Someone explain the attraction of Publix to me. 

It just seems expensive to me compared to Kroger.  I live in an area where I can grocery shop at Publix, Wal-Mart, or Kroger (excluding Sam's, Costco, Trader Joes, and Whole Foods, which are all different animals.).  

I rank my cost at these stores from least expensive to most as:

1. Kroger

2. Wal-Mart

3. Publix

The store seems to be a little nicer at Publix.  But as I have no loyalty to any of these stores, I want to shop at the best one.  Why is Publix better than Kroger?

The only new tech was the salt-speeders, the ""battering ram"", Rose & Finn's little shuttle thing, and some capital ships that are going to be Lego sets that no kid can afford.  The only really ""star-wars-y"" toy that you could pull from TLJ was the A-Wings (which were pretty heavily emphasized in the opening battle) and the sort-of-B-wing-looking Bombers.&&There aint nothing different about our love!

That said, in my experience working there, many customers do not care what they're paying, they love the experience (service and cleanliness)&&Publix was less expensive than Kroger when I lived in Orlando and in Nashville. In one city Kroger had a better deli and in another the Publix won out. It may just depend on the city and the specific store. &&Their deli stuff is the best out of all three in my opinion, although I have very limited exposure to Kroger’s stuff. I think this is why the younger demographic likes it the most since it’s more convenient for a single person to just get a rotissiere chicken or something and make their own sides. If you can get the fried chicken within an hr of them coming out the fryer, they’re pretty amazing, especially at the price. &&Nicer store, they treat employees better, higher quality in-house food, and they are literally 5 minutes away from where I live.&&I've never been to a Kroger but saying walmart is better than publix just because their average prices are lower is a sorta weak point when other things are taken into consideration. Walmart doesn't do sales, bogo's, or 2/3 for $X, they just have a lower average price. So if you're looking for oatmeal and you buy it $2.50 a box at walmart, publix could have it BOGO at $3. Obviously you'll save more if you buy the same thing every time at walmart, but publix can make experimenting with new foods affordable. The publix name brand stuff is surprisingly good and rivals the price you'll see at walmart while being higher  in quality. You also get actual butchers that will custom cut steaks and will fillet/deskin your fish. A deli with really good cold cuts and cheeses, not even talking about their fried chicken and subs because those are given. An in house sushi chef if your store has one that serves pretty damn good/convient sushi for a supermarket. Employees will ask if you need help unlike walmart where they avoid eye contact. Publix doesn't blare really dumb country/pop/rock music 24/7. Their produce is some of the most affordable while being the freshest around. They have a decent selection of local and niche products for sale as well. The store is clean/organized (no having to squeeze between an isle and a block of unstacked inventory to get to something). They have a nice return policy, if you don't like something you can literally just return it and they'll give you the money back but i'm sure most places have this. Their pharmacy offers like 7 different drugs for free, thought it's not like they'd break your bank anyways.

Yes plain white paper but with StarWars packaging and a really cool StarWars cardboard box.&&Branding the produce has been a huge help in getting picky eating children to eat more fruits and vegetables.

)&&The two main issues were ""lack of Rey toys and sales"" for Episode 7. Before Starwars episode 7 came out all toys did not focus on Rey and all trailers showed Finn holding a light saber. she was not included in any prerelease toys or figures and when she was she was listed as ""scavenger"". So she sold worse than most other toys thinking she was a sidekick not the main. There was also this backlash with her not being in any merch when the film came out. Again this was because they didn't want to spoil the movie. She came out very very strong 2-3 weeks after the movie was in theaters but nothing really before then. They always showed Finn more prominent and even had her listed as ""scavenger"" on some box art and had zero images showing her with a light saber, flying or doing anything. 

At this point there is a huge downtrend in toy sales overall and toys that sell better are not best for the Human characters of star wars. Besides Pop Vinyls human figures sell poorly. Even when they do sell people want the droids and cute animals for their kids. Think about how many star wars pillows and stuffed animals are Poggs, RSD2, BB8. Collectors also learned from episode 1 that the toy value didn't go up at all.&&There was very little merchandising tie ins before the original Star Wars trilogy.

Lucas practically invented it. 

These days everything has a merchandising tie in. The line between what is a show and what is just advertising for the merch is blurred if it even exists.

There is a hell of a lot more competition. &&Kind of circumstantial but my kids who are 8 and 10 years old and their friends have zero to little interest in star wars. They like Ninjago Guardians of the Galaxy and spiderman so it's not a anti scifi fantasy thing. I know their are kids out there who love it but it does not appear to me to be the mass amount of kids into star wars like my generation. I think it's a story that was never designed to be expanded or over explained (midichlorians for example). Even the Greeks knew to never over explain a story and to leave them wanting more. On top of all that and probably the most likely problem with the franchise is that kids just want to do and have their own thing that was not their parents thing as a child. &&Because people think Rey is the future for young girls. She’s an inspirational character but girls still want to be Princesses. 

I work on an initiative that pushed the existing Princess franchise into more of a strength role, called Dream Big, Princess, and its been accepted extremely well.

The Rebellion crushed the Empire at Jakku, because that is where one of the last Super Star Destroyers was, and then didn't care to try and find the Eclipse, Palpatine's personal Super Star Destroyer? 

The Rebellion, which was known for it's espionage and intelligence divisions, just stopped caring about a ship that was equipped with basically mini-Death Star lasers? Also, if a bunch of people that were partying on Canto Bight were arms dealers who were selling to both sides how did the Republic not keep tabs on them?!

And then when The First Order became a threat again and LEIA, one of the most important people in the New Republic, is taking it seriously enough to join up with a resistance movement they still do next to nothing. 

I guess the New Republic could be super inept but holy shit. Makes me think this whole thing was an inside job. X-FIGHTER FUEL CAN'T MELT KYBER CRYSTALS&&Check out the book Bloodlines by Claudia Gray, I just finished the audiobook on overdrive and it helps fill in some of the political bits and explains why Leia goes on to form the resistance.

I just watched that Toys thing on Netflix which states all this. But I have always heard about the thing you're replying to (Lucas forgoing money for merch rights - something the show didn't mention at all).

Now I know Im pretty but I aint as pretty as a couple o' cigarrrs&&You're not supposed to inhale,  Gary.&&>During the production, he puffed so many of Churchill's beloved Romeo y Julieta Cubans (at least 400 of them, at $50 a pop, with $20,000 of the film's $30 million budget literally going up in smoke) 

>As far as Wright's concerned, though, the poisoning was a small sacrifice to make for the greater good. ""It's Winston Churchill,"" he says. ""You can't have Winston Churchill without a cigar.""

Nothing but respect for Oldman, but man, I think the performance would of been just fine if he smoked faked cigars. &&Gary Oldman :  I got the results of the test back. I definitely have lung cancer.&&>But there remained one giant problem: how to give Oldman Churchillian girth. Gaining that much weight for the role was out of the question; Oldman didn't want to risk his health. 

Won't get fat for role in the name of health.   
Will smoke 400 $50 cigars in the name of accuracy.    

Uh huh I see what's going on here. I wonder which his physician would have preferred. &&LPT: When Googling Gary Oldman,  be careful not to accidentally drop the “r”.&&My favorite is still Jonah Hill getting pneumonia from snorting so much fake coke on the set of WoWS

You never go full Daniel Day-Lewis. (unless you're actually Daniel Day-Lewis)&&Incredible range of roles and always delivered seamlessly. I think Gary Oldman is one of the greatest film actors of all time.

He made True Romance *even better*.&&Go easy on the cigars old man!&&Story time:
About 8 years ago I was fresh out of high school. Fairly popular but not romantics wise with the ladies because of my low self esteem.
Went with some good mates to the hottest club in town.
A really hot chick from school was there that I got along with well. She was flirting with all the other guys except me, which doesn’t really bother me, probably wasn’t her type and I’m not a fedora wearer. but what pissed me off is that we were sitting in a circle and she offered every guy in that circle a cigarette, clockwise, but skipped me entirely.
I don’t even smoke, but to stick it to the man (or woman on this case) I went to the smoke vending machine, chose the most expensive pack of cigarettes there, hung out with a different group of friends that were at the club as well, and smoked every single one like I was The Smoking man from X-Files in 3 hours.
I was in bed with nicotine poisoning for days.
Haven’t touched a cigarette in years.
Hormones makes you do stupid things.&&[deleted]&&But could he pull off a Snoop Dogg biography?&&When can us Yanks see this movie?&&-How many cigars do we need for this movie?
-All of them.&&1. I'm not sad.

2. 100% of non-smokers die too.&&I’ve experienced nicotine poisoning when I was 15 in Jerusalem. Shat my pants while I was asleep....twice. &&I smoked 20000 $ of weed where is my front page&&This seems like probably an apocryphal/dubious story spread by publicists to draw attention to Gary Oldman's Oscar baiting during voting season&&The guy at the back, far right. Old Will Farrell&&Nicotine poisoning really sucks.  Once when I was about 18-19, I was working at a UPS sorting plant so my shift started at 11:30pm, and I had been up since about 7am that day.  I wanted a little pickmeup before work, so I stopped at a gas station and picked up a can of winterberry skoal.  The drive was about a half hour, so I did a dip, and was feeling pretty good after about 15 minutes.  So good in fact, that I figured, what the hell, I'll take another dip before I get to work.

Well after showing up at my sorting line it took about 10 minutes before I started to feel a little wonky, and then within another 5 minutes I had turned pale as a ghost, my stomach started to hurt, and I got really bad flop sweats.  My boss saw me and told me to go to the bathroom.  I went there and started to feel very nauseous so I sat on the toilet, but things didn't get any better.  At that point I was getting dizzy and sweating like a madman, so I laid down on the bathroom floor (yup, it was gross).  After about 5 minutes my boss walked in and was just like ""Oh wow, you look like shit man, once you're feeling a bit better you can just take tonight off"".

After about 10 minutes I felt good enough to stand up and walk, so I headed out to my car and started to drive home.  Finally after about 10-15 minutes my mouth began to water uncontrollably, and I knew what was coming, so I pulled over, stumbled out of my car, and threw up in a ditch for 5-10 minutes.  Afterwards I felt great again, AND I had gotten a night off work!

Seriously though, fuck nicotine.&&The guy is a method actor. It makes sense to me that he’d insist they were real&&I'll be real, actors are fucking dumb&&Bring me every cigar. 

Whatdaya mean every cigar? 

EEEEEEVVVVEEREERRRRRRRRRRRRY CIGAR !!!!!!!!!&&Gary Oldman's become old, man.&&Which would make it all the more hilarious if he lost Best Actor to a guy playing Tommy Wiseau.&&Worked on an indie feature film and the lead actor was method acting the entire time he was on set. He wasn’t a smoker but smoked so many packs of cigarettes. It’s an art for them. &&I hope it was in the form of two 10,000 dollar cigars!!!&&So that puts him on pace with Churchill then?&&I feel sorry for when he does the Keith Richards biopic&&It must be noted that Winston Churchill was kinda eccentric (well in general, but also) when it came to cigars; he didn't quite ""smoke"" them all. 

Citing Cigar Afficionado:

""Churchill typically smoked between eight and 10 cigars per day, although he did not constantly smoke his cigars but often allowed them to burn out so that he could chew on them instead. In this manner of consumption, the cigars often became mauled and frayed. To address this problem, Churchill devised what he called a ""bellybando,"" which was a strip of brownish paper with a little glue on one end. To prevent the cigar from becoming excessively moist and to keep it from fraying, he would wrap the bellybando around the end.""

The bellybandos also made it somewhat easier for Churchill to smoke so many cigars every day, because they limited direct contact with the tobacco and, therewith, Churchill's intake of nicotine. Churchill smoked his cigars down to about the last one or two inches, and, later in life, when he spent much of his time in the country at Chartwell, his staff would save all of the ends of his cigars in order to give them to one of the gardeners at Chartwell, a Mr. Kearnes, who liked to break them up and smoke them in his pipe.""&&He's dedicated to the craft.  Gotta respect that.&&Probably because he got snubbed for [his role of a lifetime in ""Tiptoes"". ](https://youtu.be/LX21fA9wUnE)&&Nothing screams Devotion to your character like lung cancer... &&They did exactly that with the other Churchill movie this year. I saw the movie and a Q&A with lead Brian Cox and this director earlier this year and they used different sized electronic prop cigars.

I didn't really like the movie but I thought that was interesting&&I always thought they had some kind of fake smokes in Hollyweird...&&It’s Gary Oldman. Mr. Method. There are no such things as “props” to him. &&*Stunt cigar walk in, slapping asses*

Does this come back?&&>I definitely have lung cancer.

You know most people aren't sitting around inhaling on cigars right?&&Technically, obesity related illnesses kill more people than tobacco related illnesses, so he has a point. &&In all honesty the cigars he smoked, Romeo y Julieta, are amazing.  I'd totally smoke those instead of getting fat.&&My gut instinct tells me that putting on weight (Which would take a significant gain period, or a *very* unhealthy short term push to get from Oldman > Churchill size) would be significantly worse. The time it takes to gain / loss is probably the big one there, he can stop the heavy cigar smoking at the end of the shoot, and start at the beginning, the weight gain would be around for a lot longer. 

While 400 cigars is bad, I'd wager that its more the time in which he smoked them that would prove more of an issue. In terms of the great scheme of things, I cant help but think that's actually not that much. It's only over one a day for a year; something that most doctors would tell you not to do, but I don't think it'd be enough to guarantee any real health issues.

Nicotine poisoning is probably the worst thing he was *likely* to suffer. Although I'd be interested to know if rate of smoking has any difference on health. If I smoke 100 cigarettes in a day, is the lung cancer risk higher than if I smoke 10 for 10 days? I mean, you'd be coughing up horrible black shit, but in terms of long term? &&Gary Oldman had no problem playing a midget by getting on his knees. Couldn't he have just puffed out his cheeks and walked around in a slow exaggerated fashion while someone off set played the tuba?&&Hmmm......

At least there are some actors not abusing their status and power in Hollywood.&&Prop cigars are usually just herbal and those have definitely been around way longer than Hollywood.&&Gotta appreciate the dedication.

Cigarette smokers inhale, and cigarette mfgs go to great lengths to make their smokes ""smooth,"" more easily inhaled.  Cigar smokers don't bother, and so cigar smoker is harsh on the lungs.  You don't make that mistake twice.

You can get a nicotine buzz from holding smoke in your mouth-- your mouth absorbs it, as does some of the saliva you swallow. If you're drinking booze, the alcohol can absorb even more.

True ""method"" acting is a traditionally American style of acting which has actors depicting characters by essentially manipulating their own emotions and memories to ""become"" the character. This contrasts from the traditionally British ""technique"" acting, which has actors essentially mimicking people.

What most people think of as ""method"" acting is probably better to be considered ""extreme"" method acting, which is when you see actors staying in character off camera.

However, the term originates from the acting philosophy of Sanford Meisner, who developed his own ""method"" as a reaction to the perennially popular ""system"" of Russian director Constantin Stanislavski. The basic difference (and I'm vastly simplifying here, so other acting nerds please bear that in mind) is that Stanislavski says ""use your imagination to act a role"" whereas Meisner says ""draw directly on your real life and memories to act a role"".

Meisner technique actually differs substantially from the traditional “method” approach. 

Both approaches were derived from Stanislavski, but Method as we commonly think about it (psychologically) was taught by Lee Strasberg. METHOD is the one that encourages drawing emotions from real life experiences and applying them to the current role. 

MEISNER technique differs in that it wants the actor to actually stop thinking internally so much and to react instinctively to the environment around them. This is why its exercises focus so much on word repetition, so that the actual meaning of what is being said comes through instead of focusing on what the words are. 

TL;DR

Method: recall relevant moments from your past and apply how you felt then to the present scene

Meisner: get out of your head and react in real time, focusing more on the meaning of the dialogue behind the words rather than the actual words themselves

Source: I’ve taken acting classes focusing on both approaches 

Now all of this is pretty different to the “method” acting undertaken by big stars who stay in the character 24/7, a la Jared Leto as the joker. That’s something else. &&And then you had Meyerhold over there going ""FUCK IT, CARTWHEELS AND EXAGGERATION FOR E'ERYBODY!""&&I bought them once to try and quit smoking.

they vary wildly by brand but some aren't awful. i hear ecstacy are good and honeyrose has some good ""flavors"" but right now ive got some amazon Nosmoq(?) that are kinda gnarly, and some from a high-end kind of alternative shop called Catchtilly that you hand roll. the Nosmoq are Korean originally from what I can tell and they're 'rose flavored' but you can't really tell. it burns faster than tobacco and it smells like a bonfire alright.

the catchtilly are chamomile, mullein, and mugwort. they're labeled for ""relaxation, respiratory support, and body purification"" but really i prefer them because the herbs are way closer to tobacco in feel. there's definitely a lot of options for different herb blends and tastes out there.

  Another note is that he seemed like he pushed Kaufman too far. It was Danny DeVito's testimonial that made that apparent.

This isnt and never was a health things, it's a practicality thing. &&f(ಠ‿↼)z&&Upvotes all around, this is a better explanation than I gave. Which, as I said, was a simplification.

There's a terrible understanding for the layman, because famous ""Method"" actors like Daniel Day-Lewis aren't Method at all, he's said he uses Stanislavski.
&&This is more correct, but I'd still like to add things. The Method in older texts refers to Stanislavski because that is where this all came from. But the key bit we're talking about here is affective memory / sense memory, which is what Strasberg is known for. Stainislavski used this early on but later in his life abandoned it, this is what Stella Adler found it when she met with Stanislavski, which Strasberg was not happy with. 

What we're talking about here with Affective Memory is the emotional prep side, with Meisner it is more about daydreaming. And this is all meant to be for preparation, once you're in the scene it is a different story, and in this respect of being open and honest Meisner and Strasberg didn't really disagree on. &&Oh wow, what a nice informative post. Thanks. &&Just recently finished the Sam Wasson biography of Bob Fosse , and there was this nice bit in it about Meisner:

*While Lee Strasberg sank his students in psychoanalytic mires, Meisner emphasized clear, task-oriented objectives, actions as simple as opening the door, closing the window -- in his words, ""living truthfully under imaginary circumstances."" It was simple to understand and difficult to execute. To a performer asked to play a character in fantastic or ridiculous circumstances, like those in musical theater -- or, even more ridiculous, like those in musical comedy, with its cotton-candy logic -- Meisner's technique offered a way through: be you. Truth and simplicity were always there, and any performer, regardless of his gifts, could harness them.*

&&They dont like that miller has creative control of their money maker. They know its a franchise with potential so they want to turn it into a meme machine.&&> This makes zero sense at all. Miller's got two scripts ready to go. Fury Road was a massive hit. Warner Brothers is literally sitting on a blockbuster franchise and they won't make it because they're bickering over 7-10 million.

Warner Brothers has plenty of franchises, Miller has Mad Max and both he and his cast will be aging irreversibly as those sequels are delayed on and on again as this lawsuit continues.

Warner also has to watch out not to set a bad precedent where their producers and directors can sue them quickly into submission every time a contract dispute emerges.

So it makes plenty of sense. Both sides have plenty to win if the sequels are made, but plenty to lose if they concede the lawsuit. So the game of chicken is on.&&It's not the 7 million that's the problem.

It's the co-financing right-of-first refusal deal the studio didn't honor that is worth 12.5% of the film.

Between that and the other 7-10 million, it's nearly 50 million dollars.

That's a big chunk of change.&&> Fury Road was a massive hit

I just want to point out, it cost about the same money as The Mummy with Tom Cruise and made less money overall. People jerked themselves raw about it, but it wasn't really that big of a hit.&&Seriously...

Mad Max FR was great but I actually don't want to look forward to only sequels.

He didn't plan on Fury Road being the last.&&Without Miller, a Mad Max film won't be appealing. Even Fury Road still had that classic charm from the old series of films that made it unique. The way he tells the story has this Australian influence that I'd hate to see disappear (and turn Mad Max into generic Hollywood dreck).&&Perhaps they're speculating in Miller's old age. &&They just don't seem like a very creator friendly studio at all these days.&&On the one hand, George Miller could use his creative genius to make another super entertaining oscar-nominated summer blockbuster.

On the other hand... *MEMES*.&&How stupid can they be. Mad Max is a money-maker *because* Miller has creative control. As soon as it gets taken over by Warner Bros. suits penning the script by committee and focus groups it will stop being anything meaningful.&&They don't like that Miller has creative control.

They want to be able to cast and recast it, shift around the directors and other creatives, rewrite the script five or six times and make sure the main star IMMEDIATELY wants out after the jumbled mess that is their vision hits the big screen.&&Yeah, better ruin this too and make it into a Marvel franchise reskinned with an outback lawless montage!!

Yeah!!~!~!!!&&This is the best explanation for why WB doesn't wanna cave. They know they'd make a lot of money off the franchise but the also know that they have a lot more films they could make and they don't want anyone else getting any ideas about screwing around with them. They want to cultivate the ""we don't need you but you sure as hell need us"" atmosphere in the film industry to protect their bottom line across the board &&In addition to getting the message out not to sue them, they are also getting the message out not to work with them.

Fury road was wildly sucesful, one of the best action films of alltime. He shouldn't have to sue for earnings: he should get a bonus ffs.&&I would rather they not make the goddamn movie than make a fucking reskinned Marvel movie.

Star Wars in the middle of nowhere on Earth. yay.&&He could easily walk away and make ""Desert Dylan: The Lightning bubble's Revenge"" and I think the audience would still show up. &&The problem for WB is that the lawsuit is in Australia and laws differ in Australia which is probably why they tried to argue that Australia wasn't the place for the lawsuit about an Australian movie should be heard.  &&""Made less money"". The Mummy took a 95 million dollar loss.&&Mummy made 410 global and Max only 380


BUTTTTTTTT. Mummy had 90 mill from china, where studious get notoriously low % of the money back. Whereas I don't think Max was ever released in china. 

Also, Max got double the box office gross in North America, where studious get a high % of the money back.

So the studio would have got more from Max, probably quite a lot more. 

I also imagine Max will do better on blueray etc than mummy.&&Reports vary on the budget for The Mummy. Some publications reported figures well in excess of $200m, possibly as high as $345m when you include marketing, but I haven't seen any estimates for Fury Road over $160m, and I doubt it was marketed as heavily as The Mummy. The Mummy may have made $30m more, but that isn't much to brag about when you factor in the reviews, awards, and public perception. You would have to be stupid to greenlight another Mummy movie, but people are begging for more Mad Max.&&Fury Road became much more popular after it left theaters, the box office for a sequel will likely be substantially higher.&&But come on, it won 5 oscars out of 8 in which it was nominated. People care about this franchise. &&My friends dad worked on the Fury Road production. The thing about Fury Road was that the budget was massively inflated due to continue delays in production (it was in production hell for a long time before it was released. Also, they had to move their entire shoot to a different country because of changes in climate). If they made a sequel it would probably cost significantly less knowing what they know now. 

Also Fury Roads marketing budget was $43.7 million in total*. The movie grossed $378.9 million dollars worldwide on a reported budget of $150 million. An average hit - probably just broke even in theater release and made a profit on VOD/DVD/Streaming 

*http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/summer-movie-ad-buys-mission-821043&&Peter Jackson has sued WB/New Line over LOTR profit sharing and Sylvester Stallone is currently suing WB over profit sharing from his early 90s movies. &&I know, right? Why can't they recognize that the thing is a money printing press?

👉😎👉zoop&&We all know franchises like Harry Potter and star wars are worthless flops. It's a charity that studios make their movies.

&&Actors actually don't that often. Some do, bit they learn fast.

Usually the studio preys on naive people who trust that they will get paid on actual profits. Or they just strong arm folks.

It seems like what happened here was fine, then the studio found a loophole and exploited it. ""sure you'll get a bonus of you keep costs under zzz million. What's that? You're 1 million under budget? Well let's me add in something right here... And there. You're over budget.""

To be fair, Tgis deal isn't hm half as scummy as normal. At least dude got paid.

I might’ve been ina weird mood because I missed the intensity.&&Scott Cawthon is a really nice guy, but I'm pretty sure even he knows that no one besides MatPat gives two shits about FNAF these days.&&Wasn't Fury Road  a biopic based on Harvey Weinstein?&&Wait, you're hoping for more sexual assaults in hopes of better movies? 😕&&To be fair, Mad Max isn't so much a ""universe"" as a film version of a short story collection starring very similar protagonists. No movie is really a sequel to any other in the franchise, though Road Warrior is the closest you'd get to a sequel to the original.&&One of the most crucial parts of story-telling is ending it. 

I think, in part, that some of the profit derived from ""universes"" movie making, is that people WANT to know The Ending of a story... I am no longer invested in these movies because if I wanted bullshit cliffhangers, I'd watch tv!

I feel the same way about most Fantasy-Adventure books... I don't bother with chronicles unless I know there's a conclusion (ie three books or even five... but 12+ books and STILL not concluded?! Feggeddabouttit! It can't be GOOD, if has no ending... upwards of a third of the story is missing) 

As a kid, I used to think ""this movie was AMAZING... why hasn't it won more awards?!"" But, as I get older, I now think things like ""I'll wait till it's on dvd... maybe even not until it's sequel is out. It ain't a good story unless it has a good ending!"" The storytelling aspect has to be tight, or it doesn't get my money. 

... unless it's something my wife really wants to watch.  Oy vey. &&I'm tired of everyone trying to start a universe because they always fuck up and do it wrong. They want a sweet piece of that Star Wars/Marvel pie but they're too shitty/lazy to take the time to do it right.

You can't just build a universe with one shitty movie. DC's been trying that for years.&&I could understand that to a movie which still hasn't expanded on it, but this was the 4th mad max movie. &&The WB are some of the oldest money-grubbing clueless fucks around. Everyone else in hollywood's big are killing it creatively, but the WB is falling way behind. Why?

[This is the same studio that made Swordfish, one of the most shameful pieces of corporate trash in the last 20 years.]

Kinda like how Marvel owns the Hulk character but any Hulk movie has to be distributed by Universal&&You'd think part of that contract would be him getting paid, no?&&Everything needs Keanu Reeves.&&People mock Waterworld, but I loved that movie. I just think they're afraid of the ocean. &&Or ""Surf Nazis Must Die""&&Mad Max and Waterworld cancel each other out.&&There already was a Point Break sequel. I envy you for not knowing about it.&&Warner Bros is just being cheap as shit.

Just give George Miller as much money as he wants/needs.&&If it's a choice between this or a Furiosa Prequel/Origin story, then I'd much rather the series end with Fury Road. I lost all interest hearing it'd be a side-character prequel origin story. That's not what Mad Max is about, at all, it literally can't be a Mad Max movie without Mad Max. We don't need to know her history, what happened, etc. That's the kind of thing left better to mystery.&&A Bryan Singer production...&&The magnum opus! Praise be!&&Fury Road 2, starring Adam Sandler, Kevin Hart, and Melissa McCarthy in their first lead roles in an action drama. &&WB is so stupid. Seriously, how do you let Zack Snyder control your flagship franchise ***after*** BVS and then treat George Miller like he's disposable?!?  Are you really that lacking in judgment and taste?&&I generally agree with that. It is possible someone talented tries to pull a Villeneuve later, but I really really doubt it. This is Miller's child and I am hoping that maybe he will get to finish the films he has planned.&&Franchises often have momentum. After a very good movie you can make 1 or 2 sequels that arent good, and because it takes awhile for people to realize there has been a change in quality, keep making money on them.

As divisive as this statement may be, I feel Star Wars has been the poster child of this. They could make 2-3 lemons and still have people come out for record weekend openers for them, until people really internalize the drop in quality&&you'd hate to see it but you'd still see it, so why should Hollywood care?&&But we have to add marvel quips and reference current politics!!!!&&As much as I liked Fury Road i felt it did not have quite the same feel as the first two.  I'm not sure how a film approached like them would fare these days. They were slower paced and Max himself was more reluctant hero with deep down good nature, rather than pissed off moody hunk. 

 Beyond Thunderdome also was significantly more Hollywood esque.&&Yeah I think they are banking on him wanting to release his vision before he dies and assuming their lawyers can outlast his patience or his body.&&Damn that's fucked up. You're right too&&:/&&He will ride gloriously to Valhalla&&Nolan gets to do whatever he wants. I don't see why it's so hard for them to see the same potential in Miller. Fuck the potential, he's already proved it. &&And I don't understand that at all. 

Miller gave them Fury Road, which was a runaway success (critically, if not financially). Why not trust him to handle the sequel however he wants?&&[deleted]&&He could have already done that if Happy Feet didn’t come out in November &&He’s done it so many times with everything from Babe and Happy Feet to Mad Max. The dude just makes really good films. &&memeiocre!&&> They want to cultivate the ""we don't need you but you sure as hell need us"" atmosphere in the film industry to protect their bottom line across the board

Why it's so important for the directors to stand firm.  Patty Jenkins getting to negotiate and get a higher price for Wonder Woman 2 and areas like this are so so important.&&So Miller makes ""Rad Rex"" with paramount and we all win.

The only continuing character is Max, and he can change his name for legal issues, in or out of universe.&&That atmosphere permeates pretty far beyond the movie industry (even in skilled labor). Welcome to the working class damn-near everywhere else, Hollywood. We're rooting for you.&&Yeah, that's working real well for your DC films lately, Warner.&&Isn't that already readily apparent? Is WB in danger of shutting its doors if the next Mad Max a huge hit?&&> He shouldn't have to sue for earnings: he should get a bonus ffs.

If it was that one-sided, the lawsuit would be over instantly.

Miller wants his bonus for not crossing over a budget threshold, **which he crossed over**. But he did it, he claims, because the studio made changes to his production that caused the overage.

So the lawsuit is basically a giant ""whodunnit"" regarding who's to blame for the overage, and should the bonus be paid or not.

&&All true, but OP's point is that Mad Max wasn't a furious hit, which is also true.&&I'm curious what sort of theatre release deal it originally had, and if that severely limited it's financial intake. I was surprised that Fury Road only played for a couple weeks in the Pittsburgh area at only a couple theaters (some local mainstream theaters never carried it at all) and then was gone forever while it was still in the top 3 nation wide box office numbers for like nearly 2 months. I don't know what kind of theatre distribution deal it got, but It seems like it got screwed/could've, would've made a shit ton more $ if it's distro deal had been better. Also I didn't see any local advertising or press. I think our City Paper reviewed it and that was it. I've never seen a shorter run and less-publicized movie that successful (nearly $400 million!!) in this area or any other I've lived in. I'm still curious about how and why it played out that way.&&A side effect of a deeper problem in the industry? &&IIRC New Line was basically going out of Business before LOTR basically saved everything for them financially. Pretty shitty of them to try to screw over Peter Jackson&&and also his expendables movie.&&What sucks about this even more is it's in the wake of the big Disney/Fox merger. When you're WB the last thing you want is to be delaying movies and handling lawsuits while your biggest competition is growing and expanding.&&On a similar note you know why it got over 10 years to get Super Troopers 2 made? Fox Searchlight claimed that the movie they bought at Sundance for under 3 M (ST) didn’t make a “profit”  after more than 60M in revenue. In the meantime they held the rights of SP2 hostage. &&Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman should be money printing presses, and they managed to fuck that up.

If they're interfering with Mad Max at all, I'm betting even Miller can't save it.&&The stupidity of having a money fight with a 72 years old. It's like killing the golden goose over a quarter of a egg.

&&They can recognize a money printing press without wanting to share it.&&Once they made the Hobbit into 3 movies I knew it for sure. It could have made two great movies are even one long one. The 4 got Maple edit is phenomenal. I love it.&&It's not just WB executives. It's all of Hollywood. Need I remind you that Disney tried to trademark Day of the Dead. They tried to trademark a holiday.&&I thought it was a reboot &&Which is even more disgusting, considering all the local tax credits studios get by states trying to entice productions &&Nah. Those movies are just very big ads for their merchandise, they should give market results of that.&&The change in tone is easily explained because it was a bad movie. &&The change in tone was due to there being 2 directors for the movie.  During pre-production, the producer died in a helicopter accident while scouting locations.  He was a close friend of George Miller, and he gave up directing part way through the movie after the grief became to overwhelming.  Another director took over, and basically did all the bits after Max goes to the place with the kids.  
  
I might have mixed up some facts, but I believe that's the gist of what happened.  As you noted, there is a sharp change of tone, and it's generally attributed to the change of director.&&I am the Niiiiiiightriderrrrrr. I am a fuel injected suicide machine!&&It's fucking stupidity either way &&Yeah that's not uncommon.  I really liked Fury Road but there are some movies that I watched the first time through and disliked, only to go back to them and say ""What the fuck was I thinking at the time??""&&I'm envious that he can still keep milking the fanbase&&I honestly think a FNAF horror movie could be really well made and good. I really enjoyed the whole weirdness and originality of the first game. Once the second came out I was kind of tiring of it and a fan base with a negative stigma was not helping it's case. 


I think the ""idea"" of FNAF is cool and animatronics in the dark with the right lighting are always creepy.


If they made it a niche movie like babodook that doesn't follow the awful trends of the present horror movies I would enjoy seeing it. But then again I would be happy to see any horror movie that doesn't follow the present trend.&&I see FNAF memorabilia across the grade levels at the elementary school that I work in, which SHOCKS me. I tried the game, freaked me out, went full on nope. Second grade student tells me it’s fun and not scary. 🤷🏼‍♀️&&It wasn’t faithful tho, in the film there were far too many witnesses &&Mad max is the campfire stories post apoc grandpa tells the post apoc kids before bed. &&Idk if I've read this somewhere but that's definitely how I saw it in my mind. Like if I was reading about Odysseus. Yeah some of that stuff may have happened to a man, but maybe not all of it in that order or whatever. &&Look, Batman is still the best selling comic book in the world. Think about that. One of the oldest superheroes out there. Damn near everything you can do with the character has already been done, and people still lap it up. Go onto r/comicbooks and read the weekly pull list every week. The top vote-getters are inevitably some played out stuff like Batman, Spider-Man, Captain America, Thor, etc. Literally the same stuff that's been pedaled for 50+ years. Publishers like Image and Dark Horse are at least somewhat trying to introduce some cool new stuff to the field and some if it sells reasonably well, but for the most part the fanboys just grab their same Mavel/DC titles each week. 

We can pretend that people want new and exciting things, but in reality there's more allure to something that's familiar and comfortable. It's like restaurants. Does McDonald's sell the best hamburgers in the world? Hell no, but if a stranger drives into town, they might go to McDonald's instead of the local Mom-and-Pop burger joint because they know what to expect.

Isn't Infinity War the most viewed movie trailer ever? We all know what that movie is going to be. A bunch of superheroes punching each other for 130 minutes until some token character dies and then Thanos escapes to set up all the sequels until he's conquered. Yet that movie is probably going to outgross every indie film to come out next year...combined. 

You can't really fault studios for being so thirsty for ""franchises"" when that's what gets all the buzz at Comic-Con and in the box office every year. &&If Harry Potter 1, Monsters Inc, Shrek, Spy Kids, or Spirited Away was a person, they'd be learning to drive right now.  Toy Story 2 could vote.&&Yeah. 

They're going to actual Pandora to film the sequel. &&Actaully, cameron said he's now doing 12 sequels, with the last four being shot entirely underwater, inside the titanic.&&Look on the bright side... every time you have to deal with them, there's one fewer to worry about...&&Those funerals sound fucking awesome, to be fair. 

Bad for you, amazing for everyone else. &&Sounds like a lot to deal with. Hang in there buddy!&&Filming at the same time does not at all result in a subpar product. LOTR was filmed back to back. &&One would think,  but Hollywood. &&Woah&&never has there been a more truthful statement&&Just like how Skyfall was one of the best bond movies and won Oscars and so what do they do when the next one comes around? They cut the budget and look what they get.

Edit: Oh boy looks like I was horribly misinformed. Thanks to all the people who have corrected me. I’ll be speaking with my University professor as well as the dean to have this misinformation dealt with accordingly! >:(

Edit 2: I feel horrible for misinforming people. I was mistaken. I believe what actually happened is the production schedule was shortened, not the budget. Don’t hold me to it, but I’m pretty sure that’s what happened.&&Like if it was anything else, fine, I get you're trying to run a business. But the more money you give this guy, the more money you're gonna make back, guaranteed. They're just being cheap and cutting corners, people making this decision are useless out-of-touch turds. &&Starring Kevin Spacey&&Oh no, here it comes... the MIGHTY DUSTER!&&IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD MAD MAX GAME. &&I can see the trailer as clear as day.

&&Mad Maxine, all female cast.&&When you realize that the majority of deals in Hollywood aren't actually about the projects, it makes more sense. It's a bunch of entitled creeps scratching each other's backs. There's little room for independent filmmakers between all the backscratching. Thankfully they sneak by occasionally.&&>  Are you really that lacking in judgment and taste?

apparently.

WB have proven they're fucking retards at making movies... &&The only problem I really have with Snyder's work has been the editing. The director's cut is almost always worth the time with him, and the theatrical release is almost always disappointing because WB's afraid you're going to ask for a ticket refund because you drank too much soda and missed the special effects from the trailer or something.

---

For anyone interested, here's some Director's Cut differences. Wrote this up for a different discussion, but it fits here, I think.

**From [Phil Owens' article on The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/batman-v-superman-extended-cut-adds-in-all-the-scenes-that-make-it-make-sense-commentary/) (spoiler tagged, in case anyone cares):**

>In the theatrical cut, the whole thing with Lois’ trip to Africa and the subsequent framing of Superman for some murders there seemed like a weird tangent because it never went anywhere and there was never any explanation given for why anyone thought Superman had randomly murdered some civilians. [In the Ultimate Edition, the trip becomes the entire lynchpin for the story, as it folds into Lexcorp’s larger ploy to destroy Superman.](#spoiler)

>[It turns out Lex Luthor’s people had paid that woman to lie that Superman committed those murders, essentially to mess with him and give him some self-doubt. Lois does more journalism and unravels this greater plot — including the hugely important fact that Superman couldn’t have known that Wallace Keefe’s wheelchair was filled with explosives because it was lined with lead, and his X-ray vision can’t see through lead. It’s a ploy that we can actually make sense of with the evidence at hand, instead of by filling in the gaps.](#spoiler)

>We also have more Superman and Clark Kent in general. I knew the theatrical cut hated him — it actively tries to prevent you from understanding him as a person and thus cuts off any attempts to empathize with what he’s doing. But it turns out the theatrical version of the film hated him even more than I realized, given the scenes that were restored for the Ultimate Edition. [Here we have several scenes of Clark going out and doing journalism.](#spoiler)

>We have what might be the most important scene in the entire movie for Superman as a person: [After the bombing at the Senate hearing, he actually helps people in this version instead of simply flying away. He stands outside, surveying the carnage, feeling immense guilt about not being able to save them. His comment to Lois, included in the theatrical version, about how he couldn’t prevent the bombing because he wasn’t trying to, holds emotional weight rather than communicating apathy. Lois’ later discovery about the wheelchair being lined with lead means Supes was outplayed, not that he didn’t care.](#spoiler)

**Stuff I noticed that Phil didn't mention:**

[There's a scene showing Superman finding distaste for Batman because there's news of Batman himself instigating gang violence; he brands criminals with a bat, and other criminals attack them when they land up in prison.](#spoiler)  
Later in the film, [we see Luthor's lackey paying off inmates to attack bat-branded criminals; not enough strategic-Lex stirring the pot in the theatrical cut, imo.](#spoiler)

Re: ""Martha""  
During their fight scene:  
[*""I bet your parents taught you that you mean something, that you're here for a reason.  
My parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all.  
They taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to.""*  
And then, after they're both thinking about parents being in trouble, and Superman looks to be losing a chance to save a human being that he loves & cares for; ""Martha.""](#spoiler)  
On Batman's reaction: [Take it as an adrenaline-filled half-thought of *the alien knows about mom?!* or just as an emotional trigger for a man that tries & fails to save his parents every night for his entire adult life, *whatever*. At least it didn't come out of nowhere, and whether or not you like it at this point, you should at least be able to see how it makes sense as a complete scene.](#spoiler)

It's not a perfect 10/10, but it's definitely an entertaining, re-watchable movie that I felt was totally worth my time. I'm still pissed that the theatrical cut was hot garbage, since I bought a ticket and everything, but I'd be faster to blame Brenner than I would Snyder.&&I enjoyed blade runner 2049 but there is a certain charm that would be missing that Miller brings to mad max. I know you didn't mean Villanueve specifically but yeah. I wouldn't want to it to just be some marvel movie &&Fuck it, I’d watch a Villeneuve directed Mad Max any day. &&“To pull a villeneuve” I might just use this.&&I wouldn't watch it though. At least not legally.&&Don't fuck with Immortan Miller&&Tom Hardy be like: “I wondered what would break first! Your patience...*OR YOUR BODY!*”&&I was wondering which would break first myself.&&I was wondering what would break first. &&Old men in Australia can be stubborn old bastards, I'd be prepared to wait a while if i was Warner Bro's lawyers lol I mean my pop is a prime example, has just about everything wrong with his body and still insists on going when he ""damn pleases"" and no doctor is going to tell him otherwise. Must be the Italian blood in him lol &&It honestly seems like Miller got into some serious arguments with the brass at WB. They have no logical reason to not pay him and could easily make money off that decision. It has to be something we're not seeing here &&But also I believe that I read that Nolan comes in under budget for every one of his films which is almost unheard of these days. The studios love him because he’s under budget and his movies make a lot of money. &&Well you answered your own question &&The two situations are exactly nothing alike. 

Patty Jenkins delivered a hit out of a floundering expanded universe but hadn't committed to a sequel - her negotiation and getting a higher price is standard practice.

Miller (and his production company) have been screwed out of legitimate amounts because:
1. his clause for a bonus hinged on his management of the film's budget, yet higher ups made decisions which effectively took that out of his hands - in doing so violating the terms of his contract (as if those costs aren't include, the film budget meets the criteria of the contract where he had control over aspects of budget)

2. they ignored right of first refusal for co-financing the film.

Patty Jenkins' negotiations are standard. Miller's lawsuit is far more important because it is a lawsuit about honoring the terms of a signed contract between creative partners. &&Peeved Pete. Annoyed Andy. Vexed Vlad. Furious Fred. Irate Ian.&&My name is Max, I ain't mad, I'm spewin'.&&According to the internet, Fury Road cost $150 million dollars to make. The bonus was dependant on being under $157 million. 

Even if we agree that the first figure is probably wrong, they couldn't have went overboard with more than a couple million. Warner Bros is just playing it dumb. &&To clarify, the issue arose when the suits decided to spend extra on marketing for the film which pushed it above the budget. Totally out of Miller's control.&&It’s hilarious they had the whole cast do a photoshoot together and then abandoned the entire universe. &&I am SO glad to hear the Dark Universe is dead. It was a stupid idea from the very start.&&I like the idea of The Dark Universe in the style of the Brendan Fraser Mummy. They should start over. Pretend they never made the Tom Cruise Mummy. &&Rob Reiner and the cast of Spinal Tap are currently suing based on the complete lack of Payment they’ve seen from Royalties. I don’t want to misquote the number they’ve been paid, but it is laughably low. 

Studios are very worried about this lawsuit, as they don’t care about the money, and won’t settle. They’re doing it out of principle. I’m eager to see how it will play out, because it sounds a lot like they’re going to win and the studio has been doing everything they can to stall.&&I'd assume so. It speaks volumes when even the successful need to sue to get what they are owed (I'm not sure with the Mad Max issue but I know moving the whole shoot from Oz to Africa wouldn't be cheap and WB gave money for some reshoots in Oz). The people I've mentioned can afford good lawyers so the average person would be fucked. &&The Nerdist podcast has an episode with Jason Alexander (he played George in Seinfeld) where he talks about how the show was making millions per episode in advertising, but wasn't ""profitable"" yet so they didn't get any royalties.

So, they all demand $1m per episode recorded of new seasons. None of this ""profit-based income""  shit anymore. 
And they got a lot of media flak for it, for being greedy to demand so much money for so little work. But a show making millions each airing was not in the black on the books. 

The cgi studio behind Life of Pi went bankrupt while the movie made $600mil at box office on a $120m budget. &&base greed.  Its not an industry problem, specifically. 
&&From what I have read over the last 10 years or so this is common.  The studio will try to fuck you and expects you to sue.  I guess they net a profit for people who don't.&&New Line was very B-level hit or miss before LOTR. LOTR made them huge players. The biggest thing they had prior to that was The Nightmare On Elm Street series. To fuck over Peter Jackson after he literally took them to the next level..scum. &&Correct, they (NL) have been folded into WB. &&And then they kept on making shitty movies cause they didn't change and that's why the Hobbit got made.

And stretched into two parts.

And then three.

With no respect for Del Toro's vision and they cast him off and came crawling to Jackson cause it was too big to fail & whole thing was a trainwreck.&&Part of the reason they were going bankrupt was because of LOTR, which they spent a fortune on.  The guy who greenlit the movies was fired.&&> Pretty ~~shitty~~ expected of them to try to screw over Peter Jackson

Ftfy.
&&Really? I remember reading that Bruce wanted 3 mill for 3 days work so they got Ford for 2 mill for 3 days work instead. Sly gave BW shit on twitter at the time. &&Yes it can easily falter. The awesomeness of the last movie made me feel like a 12-year old kid in the cinema again, being constantly impressed and wowed by the unpredictable scene-switches.

I can totally see how an incompetent company could ruin it all by Hamstringing Miller and tying his hands, totally oblivious that they are slaughtering their golden goose because they think that it was *they* who caught lightning in a bottle, not Miller.&&You can read The Hobbit in the time it takes to watch one movie from the trilogy.&&The whole Hobbit thing was definitely disappointing but what WB has done with the DCEU has been downright pathetic. JL turned out to be exactly the kind of failure it deserved to be, WB execs thought they can keep making dumpster fire movies like Suicide Squad and people will keep watching them, fucking morons. &&It was [to fill a hole](http://cad-comic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cad-20120801-bce33.png)&&They realized they couldnt trademark Christmas or copyright Santa Clause so theyre trying to replace Christmas with Star Wars. For Ep IX theyre going to pay Target $500mil to have all their cashiers say ""May the Force be with You."" all December 2019 instead of Happy Holidays. &&Sort of, but only sort of.  The Mad Max movies are supposed to be basically a bunch of legends involving a certain guy, who's more of a mythical archetype than a well-defined character.&&[deleted]&&Remember when that bad guy gets hit by a train, and then re-appears on that train in a scene that's almost ripped straight out of looney-tunes (and not in a good way)?  

What a ride. &&It was bad in such an awesome way though. So many memorable scenes. Like when the sax gets shot with a crossbow bolt. And it's Tina Fuckin Turner for God's sake. And the idea that they are powering this town with pig shit is a somewhat believable post apocalyptic scenario. Don't know where food is coming from, but I don't remember that ever being addressed in any of the movies. In the latest one, I don't understand what the deal is with the enormous pipes of water. Where is that water coming from anyway?&&So bad that they abandoned the franchise for two decades.....&&The last fnaf game was released entirely for free. So while he could easily milk the fanbase for more, he does it because enjoys making the games for people.

I dont play the games myself, but it's very admirable.&&If I was MatPat, I'd hate having to do fnaf theories because of how hardcore that fanbase is and and how much crap you have to sort through for one video.&&I was thinking just before the last FNAF came out, that I was more excited for the theory than the game. I'm kinda glad the last game was the final one though, it was getting a bit drawn out. &&It won't work as a horror movie because FNAF isn't scary. Jumpscares aren't horror, they're temporary involuntary excitement. FNAF works as a puzzle game, not a horror game. After the initial shock of the jumpscare-deaths wears off, you're just irritated every time it happens.&&Fuck, *nice*&&The part where he locked beautiful women in a vault was pretty accurate&&True!

Your mention about Batman needs only ONE response... the story is simple. And really, to be the kind of story that I think is epic, up to his first battle AS Batman, and maybe the bat signal in the sky IS the conclusion... the rest is episodic. And, just because a bunch of people run blindly off a cliff, it doesn't mean it's the correct thing to do!

&&Not helping &&...those all came out in the same year? Huh.

Good year for movies.&&That's interesting. I'll bet that made acting as if they'd been on an exhaustingly long journey much easier haha. &&Never knew that is what happened. Explains a lot. The whole movie didn’t make sense once it was over&&I'm not sure where you got that from because the budget was upwards of $250,000,000 by numerous sources. Actually, because of production, the film was estimated to be higher, around $300m because producer went overboard, particularly in the Mexico sequence.

They certainly didn't cut the budget.&&Spectre was garbage because the script was garbage. Visually gorgeous but you're not allowed pop up and tell everyone that you're responsible for every bad thing that every happened in their life without any foreshadowing.&&[Skyfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyfall) had a 150-200 mil budget, while the next movie, [Spectre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_\(2015_film\)), had a 250 mil budget. That's an increase of 50-100 mil.

Are you talking about some other movies?&&""Spectre was estimated to have cost around $245 million, making it the most expensive Bond film and one of the most expensive films ever made.""

Are we talking about the same thing?&&Profitable sequal syndrome. There are a lot of ""shitty movie 2"" films out there because it's pretty much a guaranteed cash cow. Why would a studio risk money trying to make a good thing when they found IP to milk dry?&&Paid for by Harvey Weinstein and additional casting by Adam Venit. &&A-Are you in one of those loooong journeys inside your brain? A-Are you well enough to drive?&&Saint! If you're lookin' for the *favour of the gods*, Crow Dazzle's not far from here!&&I know, right?! I mean going in with very low expectations sure did help and besides the awful melee combat system, the game is kinda of a hidden gem.&&Mad Max... Is a dog?!   

This summer, WB shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth, with Mad Max: Furry Road: Dog Wars.

It'd be a combination of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and the Westminster Dog Show, but to the death. &&I hate this because I can basically see it happening too. &&Leslie Jones, seeing approaching marauders: ""Ah, hell no!""&&Needs more Amy Schumer&&Wow, you have created a movie I never want to see with less than 100 words. WB should hire you immediately.&&My god that is so vivid&&But wasn't fury road close to being that already 

Edit: (yes I know the titular character and immortan joe and nux and co were there but women had like 75% of the dialogue)

Edit again: and I'm not bringing it up as a bad thing the movie was amazing I'm just adding this because tone doesn't come across well on written medium&&From the recent news, it is closer to entitled creeps scratching each other's balls.&&The issue is they are co-producing with so many studios that it feels like they have no fucking control or vision for anything they are doing and I question how much control they have and whether they are just taking random jobs.

They made Lego Batman, Wonder Woman, The Disaster Artist, Dunkirk, It and Blade Runner 2049 in the same year as Annabelle, CHiPs, Geostorm and Justice League. Each with a totally different combination of studios.&&WB is the EA of film studios.&&Don't distract him from Dune. No one's pulled that book off on film. The best Dune movie is a documentary about not making a Dune movie. But after 2049... Villeneuve could be the one who was promised. The director who can look where we can not...&&Honestly he's one of if not the best current director &&Alright fair enough.  But a lot of people would.&&Warner Brothers are going to hire Jar Jar Abrams to reboot it.  Totally new stuff guys, seriously.&&""It would be *extremely* painful . . . For you. . .""&&I wouldn’t be surprised if the studio was just greedy and doesn’t want to hold up their end of the bargain.&&There's plenty in the article, although we'll never know the details. During production, WB interfered with production which added to the budget. The studio then turned around and said, because you went a little over budget, we get to keep these millions of dollars.

As the cherry on top, WB partnered with Bret Ratner in violation of an agreement to give Miller's company first dibs on co-financing.

Miller's only real recourse is to refuse to make another massively profitable, popular, and acclaimed movie. Good for fucking him. I'm sad about the sequels, but

FUCK THE KING&&[deleted]&&Well, no. It wasn't a *massive* success, but it was profitable enough to warrant a sequel, hence the sequel being greenlit prior to this lawsuit.&&Slightly Upset Steve.&&Miffed Miller&&Just basic hollywood accounting, fuck the creators out of money to increase the studios worth.&&Warners executive likely Went over budget on purpose so that the exects could keep the money&&Thats just photoshopped all together. Non of them wer in the same room /place at the same time&&>Russel Crowe, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, Sofia Boutella, 

>The next film was supposed to be a Bride of Frankenstein remake starring Angelina Jolie as the bride and Javier Bardem 

There's the problem, seems they were more interested in securing A-list stars to sell the movies rather than actually working on making quality movies. 

&&Do you have the picture handy? I'd love to see that&&Not that funny, they weren't all together in the same room.&&I thought they had changed their mind again and it's back on. &&It would had been cool if it was all in 1930, and super over the top hammy with no effects but with still serious competent acting and writing.

Movies are about characters.  You don't need shit if you got good characters.    &&I hate when companies try to shove a shared universe down our throats before they even establish a single story in said universe. &&I think it's a great *idea*. But they kept trying to start it with terrible movies. They've gone through 3 full films trying to start the damn thing and cancelling it every time because the movies are so bad.&&It’s stupid but I really wanted it to be good. I love the idea of rebooting the classic monster movies. I liked Dracula untold. But I feel like they missed the mark with The Mummy. The original one was campy and i once saw someone describe it as the Pirates of the Caribbean of the 90’s, and I feel that is very apt. I was hoping to see more movies with that in mind. What we got was a quasi Mission Impossible: Egyptian Curse. &&The way studios can get away with declaring a movie that returns one billion dollars on a 200 million dollar budget and 100 million dollar ad campaign ‘unprofitable’ is nothing short of criminal. The whole system needs to burn.&&Took 20 years for Prouse(dude in the Vader suit) to get paid for return of the Jedi.&&Aw that’s a shame about LoP CGI studio, arguably they made that movie believable and contributed to its massive success&&Do they just not have the bargaining power to ask for, say, a percentage of the box office income, or a flat fee, whichever is larger?

That way you're going to get paid the flat fee, but if the movie is a runaway hit making back ten times its budget you're not stuck with a tiny fraction of that profit&&Yea. I wish Jackson had made The Hobbit around the same time as LOTR. The technology to do Smaug was around and they might not have gone all crazy adding shit and people that never fucking existed. The Hobbit should have been 2 movies IMO but NL got greedy&&which made them the money back several times over... &&i'm sure the pay was all screwy. but sly said that expendables one, even though it made a decent amount of money he got paid zero for it. because he took a percentage of profits or something instead of normal pay. then because of hollywood accounting they claimed the movie made zero dollars so he got paid zero.&&I may be a bit of a fanboy on this one but Fury Road is not the lightning in a bottle; George Miller is. And their hope is that they keep him in their bottle.&&Oh man thank you for this. One of my roommates read this to me a half decade ago (without sourcing it) and it's been bothering me ever since (since Google doesn't index web comic text).

Too bad the rest of the movie couldn't live up. &&Its MatPat, researching through internet crazies just makes him more powerful &&I’m pretty sure he is kinda tired of them &&Calvin and Hobbes would be in their 40s, maybe 50s.&&Warner Bros is being run by morons.  Just look at the shit mess they've made of their DC properties.&&That, topped with there having been too many writers are in my opinion the two major problems with that movie. Surely it wasn’t Christopher Waltz because that was great casting!
Edit: The casting part is not sarcastic. Even though it kinda sounds like it haha.&&Warner Bros. basically doing the opposite of what's made good franchises continue.  Usually you get a ""sequel budget"" (look at the Hunger Games special effects and Pitch Perfect 2 even breaking the 4th wall mentioning it in the movie itself) but they've tried to push money to fund hits and then try to maximize profit.

Whereas the best way to do that is to keep making good movies...basically you get the feeling it's less truly a company and more that the executives are just meddling to the point where if making money and a profit is that big of an issue for the company whoever's driving the wagon's gonna run it into the ground.&&Yeah it suffered a lot of rewrites. Plus I can't help but feel that they wanted to Marvel Cinematic Universe it a bit by going ""oh yeah *everyone* Craig faced was part of Quantum/SPECTRE this whoooole time"" (even though it makes no fucking sense for Skyfall).&&Yeah, budget was the least of Spectre problems.&&*IT WAS ME BARRY, ME*&&People like blaming the studio but honestly sometimes the script is just bad.

Mr. Sunday movies talked about this during the fan4stic discussion. A bunch of people were trying to blame the studio for reshooting and ruining the movie, but the movie was garbage regardless. Especially with that movie where the reshoots obvious, the original parts were just not good. 

Spectre wasn’t reshoots, but a studio meddling can only damage something to an extent. A lot of the times the vision just isn’t good. Not every director can throw out a citizen Kane &&This.  Lots of good stuff in the movie, but the massive retcon job they did just because they finally got the full rights to Spectre was wholly unnecessary.&&If you're going to do that you also have to make the villain convincingly menacing. With an actor like Christoph Waltz it should write itself, but apparently not. &&I believe I was given false information. Thank you for correcting me.&&Yeah it’s like hey the last one was great so this one doesn’t have to be because people will see it. But then you have to try harder the next one.

And it is disgusting. &&Anyone remember how Peter Jackson was more or less blacklisted for a few years after the wildly successful LOTR films?

Them!, anyone?&&Also, for some strange reason they keep making sequels to these moves that don't turn a profit after grossing +800Mil&&If I used Hollywood accounting for my paycheck, I could be making $1,000 an hour and still sue my employer for not paying me minimum wage.&&Good call. The shit thing is that the music industry is far worse even if the same main 5 companies run both. Look at Sony music and the guy who sold them distribution rights  to the Meatloaf Bat Out Of Hell album, he died while trying to get them to open their books, his Son gave up and couldn't be bothered going to war with them. Even getting back to movies, Paramount got sued for stealing an Eddie Murphy movie pitch, they made Forrest Gump that made no money for the author while Hanks and Zemeckis got around 50 million each. When Gump, ROTJ, and some Harry Potter movies make no money on paper you know something isn't right with the system. &&This isn't just studios, this is just big business accounting.

That's part of the crux, so what they owe you money; do you have the cash to lawyer up enough to make them pay?&&People have been saying you gotta do percentage of gross for years. IDK why he'd agree to that&&I like it when people back themself so they should get their financial  rewards for risk and effort. Burn Hollywood Burn. &&Yes. I really hope he perseveres and gets both free reign to do another epic film, and that the damn shoot doesn't run in to the same violent problems they had on set, with storms and local belligerents.&&I think the whole thing was just a clusterfuck, honestly.  If you remember Peter Jackson was actually a last minute stand in for Guillermo Del Toro, who backed out rather late form directing _The Hobbit_ to pursue another project.

Here's a quote from [here](http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-jackson-hobbit-movie-problems/):

>Because Guillermo Del Toro had to leave and I jumped in and took over, we didn’t wind the clock back a year and a half and give me a year and a half prep to design the movie, which was different to what he was doing. It was impossible, and as a result of it being impossible I just started shooting the movie with most of it not prepped at all. You’re going on to a set and you’re winging it, you’ve got these massively complicated scenes, no storyboards and you’re making it up there and then on the spot.

I can't remember where I read it, but I'm almost certain Peter Jackson said he called for the third movie because they had no idea how to actually do the big battle at the end and that they needed time to put that together that they did not have for the second movie.

EDIT:  actually I think this is speaking about that from the same article:

>Eventually, Jackson called off the shoot to finally clear his head and work things out properly, giving the team a year to revisit the situation. Unfortunately, the Battle of Five Armies film was the worst received Hobbit film by critics.&&That's quite the theory you have. A GAME THEORY THEORY!

Create a corporation (that you run) that hires you out to companies. The price that your corporation just so happens to charge you for finding you work is the amount of money you earn.

Of course, you want to make sure you're an S-Corp not a C- Corp so that way you're not double taxed.

They then create a second company B, and company B funds the movie. A then owes B a billion dollars on paper. A makes a billion dollars, minus the 300 million to make the movie and market it. They then have to give B all of that money, so A is 300 in the red. The actor's contracts specify profits from company A and not company B, so there aren't any profits for the actors to get a share of because B is making all the money.

There's too many qualified applicants, not enough jobs, and with the rise of automation and other technologies that continue to make it easier for one person to do the work of many, it's going to get worse.

So people agree to the lowest wages just to get a job in their field, seeing as how they can't very well go on not working what with the massive student loan debts. They grow desperate, and desperation is what the corrupt and the greedy prey on.

It's why minimum wage exists. 

""You want 13 dollars an hour? I can find someone hungrier than you that'll do it for 8. Do you want the job or not?""

It's also why such a thing as unpaid internships exist. People are so desperate to find jobs in their field they will literally work for nothing because it gets their foot in the door. No one with bills to pay can get into companies that do this, and it drags the whole playing field down to who is willing to whore themselves the most.&&That's a shame. I'm in mograph and animation.

**Notable Box Office Stories:** 

* **Star Wars: The Last Jedi -** Disney had a lot to celebrate this week, from their historic merger with 20th Century Fox to what was always expected to be a massive opening weekend for The Last Jedi which achieved the highest highs it could... except always just a notch below The Force Awakens. The 8th film in the saga and 10th theatrical Star Wars film overall opened to #1 this weekend with a staggering $220M, the second best opening weekend of all time. Second best is what The Last Jedi has to settle for a lot this weekend, as the film constantly was just under TFA in terms of all time lists. First up on Friday it made $104M, second only to TFA's $119.1M making them the #2 and #1 best single day gross ever respectively. The there's the weekend gross where TLJ's $220M conquered previous #1 holders like Jurassic World, but couldn't match up to TFA's $247.9M, making TLJ the second highest grossing opening weekend ever. Then overseas the film scored $450M (despite not opening in China until January, though that country has not been too excited for Star Wars fare in the past) where for once it wasn't second on the list but rather fifth overall in terms of all time worldwide openings. So while the film is a downgrade from TFA it still shows that TFA was not a fluke and that the market is incredibly excited for the classic characters and the continuing story, with the extra $30M likely more do to the fact there was more hype for TFA than any film in history and TLJ is just the natural degradation of a franchise, similar to Age of Ultron. And let's note the film opened $70M higher than last year's Rogue One, showing there's not a Star Wars burnout yet and this particular saga has a huge power over audiences. But there's of course something more sinister on the horizon, a dark force known only by the name of...Star Wars Fans.

* **Star Wars: The Last Jedi (cont.) -** The Last Jedi was always going to open well, that much was certain, but unlike The Force Awakens which opened to good reviews and mostly positive audience reaction at the time, the  divide between critics and audiences for this film has been huge. Currently on RottenTomatoes the film has a 93% rating from critics but a 56% rating from fans. IMDB scores are also down from TFA's and Rogue One's placement on their first weekend of release. Why many fans hate the film will be the source of literally 8 billion videos, podcasts, reddit threads and articles (hell just note that *already* TLJ's official discussion has 3x as many comments than Rogue One's) so instead I want to talk about the power of the internet in terms of box office. If there's one thing I hold true, it's that more often than not the internet thinks it's a lot more important than it is in terms of affecting box office. This isn't too say that the internet never kills a film's box office, just this year social media backlash destroyed the run of All Eyez on Me. But that was a much smaller film appealing to a devoted but fickle audience. This is the second biggest opening of all time, so for fan reaction to kill it would be something truly surprising. What adds mystery to it all is Cinemascore, the audience polling system that despite many flaws does seem to be one of the last ways to poll general audiences without fear of brigading from very vocal supporters/haters. And it seems general audiences just really really like Star Wars as the film scored an A on the service, the same score that The Force Awakens and Rogue One received and higher than all three prequels (all of the OT came out before Cinemascore existed). And the weekend seems to not show any immediate backlash affecting returns, as TLJ had a better Saturday drop than TFA (38.9% to 42.7%) and had a comparable but higher Sunday drop (11.3% to 19.9%, though Sunday's numbers are expected to be higher than reported). However there is a full weekend to get through before Christmas so let's discuss what we are dealing with in terms of legs.

* **Star Wars: The Last Jedi (cont.) -** The most likely range we are looking at in terms of second weekend drop is somewhere between The Force Awakens and Rogue One. The insane thing about TFA was that it opened like a summer movie but held like a winter movie, dropping just 39.8% for its second weekend. RO on the other hand functioned a lot more like a summer movie dropping 58.7% for its second weekend. It should also be noted that both films had the advantage of their second weekend falling on Christmas weekend, a luxury TLJ does not have. Plus three new wide releases come out next week including Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle which is tracking a lot better than expected. So we could potentially look at a drop even harsher than Rogue One. While RO's second weekend drop was sizable, it still had great legs the rest of its run. To figure out by the end of all this where TLJ will land, if it has the same hold as TFA we are looking at over $800M domestic, if it's more like RO then around $750M, and if it holds likes The Avengers or Jurassic World (the only other two films to open over $200M besides TFA and TLJ) we are looking at over $650M. Now for those wondering what's the worst scenario in terms of fan and audience backlash that really kills TLJ run we are looking at around $430M domestic, which I got from calculating the multiplier from Batman v Superman, still the worst legs ever for a film opening over $100M. It will be interesting to watch the weeks ahead, especially as the backlash becomes backlash to the backlash (which has already started) and the inevitable backlash to the backlash to the backlash begins and I give up the internet forever. Whatever happens it will be fascinating and like BvS the effects may not be known even until Episode IX. Cinemascore can fail us (previously mentioned All Eyez on Me had an A- on Cinemascore), RT audience scores can be brigaded, forums can be hiveminded, so it's hard to say where the overall, global audiences land. The numbers will speak for themselves though so now we just wait and see. 

* **Ferdinand -** It's always fascinating the films that decide to go up against Star Wars, because often they are hoping at best to be overflow fillers. That might explain why despite carrying a pretty hefty budget of $111M, the animated film Ferdinand opened at #2 to just $13.3M. That marks the worst opening ever for Blue Sky Studios, the animation team mostly known for the Ice Age movies, but that feels almost expected when you tackle with the second biggest opening of all time. However all may not be lost when you compare Ferdinand to its closest peer in terms of release and content, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. For those who don't remember, this was the brave soul that faced The Force Awakens head on and while that film secured the title of highest opening weekend ever, Road Chip managed to score a #2 opening with $14.2M, fairly close to Ferdinand's opening numbers. The notable thing about Road Chip is that while it opened low it basically repeated those numbers for 2 more weekends, dropping just 8% for week 2 and 3. That's sort of what Ferdinand is aiming for here, hoping to be the choice for very young kids who may not be old enough for a PG-13 Star Wars film. However Road Chip never passed its $90M budget domestically and it's hard to think that Ferdinand will be so lucky especially with Jumanji possibly taking up other kids markets. Blue Sky always expected a rough opening, but it's hard to say right now if they are going to quietly ride this low level until the end of December or if it's the start of a truly disasterous run. 


* **Oscar Movie Round-up -** While everyone else was watching Star Wars a few people caught some of the Oscar favorites this week (probably after watching Star Wars) but things weren't looking up for everyone. First up is **The Disaster Artist** which after having great plays and expansions faltered this weekend as it added 170 theaters but dropped 58% to come in at #8 with $2.6M. That's a steep drop for a film just now hitting theaters and could either speak to its core audience just picking Star Wars instead this week or just burning through its audience rather quickly. Unless it makes a major turnaround it seems Lady Bird will become the highest grossing A24 film and stay that way. Meanwhile **Shape of Water** marked its last minor expansion before going wide next week. The film's theater count climbed to 158 to come in at #12 with $1.7M, a per theater average of $11,000. This marks a good potential for Shape of Water that audiences aren't too hesitant to see a mute woman fall in love with a fish man. Meanwhile despite **Darkest Hour** not having the all encompassing march to Best Actor many thought as Timothee Chalamet has been taking a lot of the wins away from him in critics groups, the film keeps expanding well, adding thirty theaters to come in with $855K, a per theater average of $10,119. Speaking of Chalamet **Call Me By Your Name** is finally starting its relentlessly slow crawl to expansion as after three weeks of per theater averages over $30L, the film got into the double digits of screens. This weekend it was in 30 theaters where it made $491,933, a per theater average of $16,398. The film is going to be adding a lot more theaters next weekend and is finally going wide on January 19th. Finally it seems I was right that audiences just aren't interested in Woody Allen this year as **Wonder Wheel** expanded to 536 theaters this weekend but only made $472,216 (notably less than CMBYN which is in 500 less theaters), a per theater average of just $881.

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **Coco** - Coco is steadily marching its way towards $500M worldwide, and while certainly a strong US run has helped the biggest single country gross for the film is actually in China, where the film has become a major surprise hit and this week surpassed the US domestic gross ($150M) with $152M. In fact the film is such a surprise success over there that the Chinese film board has granted a rare extension for the film. For those who don't know, China only allows US films to play for a limited run, but occasionally fans will demand a film stay so much that the board grants an extension. This is no small extension either, as it will allow the film to run until January 23rd, a full month extra. With this much expanded room it's almost certain Coco will pass $200M in the country. 

* **Justice League** - I guess every weekend since it opened has been a rough weekend for Justice League but this one particular stung on two fronts. First this marked marked the first time that Wonder, the film that opened the same week as Justice League, actually made more than Justice League weekend with Wonder at #4 with $5.4M and Justice League at #5 with $4.1M. While Wonder certainly has had incredible legs, let's not forget that Justice League opened $65M more than Wonder so for it to already be beaten by it is rough. If that wasn't enough the film closed in China to $104.3M, which to give perspective is lower than what Ant-Man made in that country ($105M). Justice League will probably go down as the highest grossing box office disaster ever. 

**Notable film closings** 

* **Dunkirk**  -  The latest from Christopher Nolan proves once again he has an incredible rare talent to be a critical and box office darling as his WWII drama closed to $188M domestic and $525.2M worldwide on a budget of $100M. There was concern going in that Dunkirk was finally the film where Nolan would take it on the nose in terms of too much ambition. From discussing a moment in WWII history not well known outside Europe (though this year saw not one, not two, but three movies about Dunkirk) to the unique time dilation effect of the narrative the film seemed like just too much for general audiences. However people went for the film hard as while the film opened to a very good $50M, it held remarkably well over the summer months. As expected Nolan's home country went crazy for Dunkirk, where it grossed a massive $75M, though it also surprisingly was a decent hit in China as well grossing $50M over there. Despite this clearly being WB giving Nolan a favor for him making them all of the money, Nolan proved that he's pretty much unable to make even his most experimental film not be a hit. 
 
* **Happy Death Day** - It's been a damn good year for Blumhouse who closed out the year with a great October low budget hit, as this high concept horror film closed to $55.6M domestic and $114.1M worldwide on a budget of $4.8M. As with any BH film that is a remarkably low budget for such a good return, and while not quite at Split or Get Out level it's a good example of BH really capturing a smart high concept idea and marketing the shit out of it, very similarly to their Purge series. While critics didn't love the film's Groundhog's Day meets Scream pitch, audiences did and it opened very well and held fine. Now that almost certainly the studio is looking at their second Best Picture nomination for Get Out, they have really become a massive powerhouse force in the industry.

* **American Made** - While Tom Cruise's latest didn't quite live up to his heights, it still showed there's enough love for him out there as American Made closed to a decent $51.3M domestic and $134.8M worldwide on a budget of $50M. The film which tried to recapture some of that 1980s Cruise magic with his beloved director du jour, Doug Liman. The film didn't make much of a splash at home but managed to scrounge up enough here and there for a solid hold, if nothing remarkable. With two films this year just barely justifying their existence it feels like Tom Cruise is holding on to the last legs of his box office stardom, and it's not clear when exactly that's going to really end. 
 
* **Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween** - The sequel to Madea's surprise success didn't come anywhere close to the first but did manage a solid pull of $47.3M domestic and $48.3M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The original Boo! last year was a major hit, scoring $73M. Not only did Boo 2! open $9M less but it also had stronger drops. It's not enough to say kill the whole franchise but if this drop continues for Boo 3! I would say kill the franchise ASAP.&&How in the shit does **Ferdinand** have a $110M budget?

What a disaster for Blue Sky.&&It's not just Star Wars. Coco is still out too. Ferdinand might have had a chance in the summer, but not against the combined might of Disney.&&Damn, Happy Death Day budgeted 4.8M and made 114M. That's one hell of a good investment.&&I didn't realize TLJ would be so long... kept expecting it to end at a pivotal moment as a cliffhanger.&&I always find it hilarious when Star Wars is compared to other big movies. Like how Justice League has made over 600 million and Star Wars is released one weekend and it's made 450 million. &&Definitely curious to see how close *Avengers: Infinity War* comes to challenging this number in a few months. Man is it ever mindblowing what Disney has achieved with their properties. &&Shape of water was only playing at one theatre in all of Austin with barely sny slots. 

It was pretty good&&Huh, apparently nobody saw John Cena.&&How can you people choose to watch Star Wars over a bull that is voiced by goddamn John Cena?? You disgust me.&&I wanted to see Diaster Artist, but none of the multiple theaters near me are even showing it.&&[deleted]&&TLJ is no surprise. Even the people I see who say they hated it are saying ""well, I'm going again soon just to make sure.""&&TLJ will be fine because people who love it or hate it are both saying ""go see it and form your own opinion""&&I saw both Star Wars and the Disaster Artist this week, and thoroughly enjoyed both. Money well spent all around&&The Force Awakens was also the first Star Wars film in a decade, so it was always going to have a higher box office. &&To your point on the internet killing movies. I only check reviews or scores on something I'm on the fence about seeing. If it's a great director, writer, or a new star wars movie I'm going to see it and then after I look at reviews. All Eyez on me I was already skeptical so that just sealed me not seeing it&&TLJ had some of the best scenes of the franchise and some of the worst of the franchise.&&I think it is interesting to see the performance of Star Wars: The Last Jedi on its second weekend.

RT, Metacritic, and IMDb user reactions were negative but the general audience reactions from Cinemascore and comscore.com are postive.

According to Cinemascore, it earned ""A"" Score and it earned earned an 89% overall positive score and a five-star rating from moviegoers on Comscore.com.

EDIT: Clarifications&&Glad that Thor: Ragnarok is doing so well (Marvel killing it with Spider-Man, Guardians 2 and Thor all grossing more than $800 million).

I'm a little disappointed with how Coco is doing financially, especially when compared to almost everything from Pixar. Coco was an excellent film and I'm hoping it will earn significantly more, although that seems unlikely at this point.&&Disney’s going to have to start printing their own money soon 

Edit:Disney Dollars here I come&&I don't think the online backlash will influence TLJ's legs too much. My friend who's only seen TFA and TLJ liked it a lot, and she probably would recommend it to her friends. I liked it enough, and I would recommend it to others. I think it will do fine.&&I honestly don’t understand why Fox keeps shoving their kids movies in a Star Wars opening weekend. They did the same thing with Alvin and the Chipmunks back in 2015, and I believe it underperformed. My guess is the studio execs have the assumption that their movie will be for kids too young for Star Wars. Unfortunately, I think most kids even as young as three are going to be more interested in Star Wars than some kids movie. Not to mention, Coco was already occupying that role. 

I think they should hold these movies until January, release them the first or second week. The Star Wars hype will have mostly died down, and parents are going to be looking for something new for their kids to watch. Also, competition will be super low because that’s when every studio releases their “meh” movies. It still might not do great, but they could at least break even instead of bombing. &&I think the people who made Ferdinand should have maybe pushed the fact that JOHN CENA is in the film (other than on WWE TV) and chose any other week to launch.

In the adverts in the UK, there is zero mention that John Cena is the actor behind one of the main characters. Surely if they promoted this alot more kids would have wanted to see it.

Regardless, it will probably make way more than it cost in the long run. Give it a year and it will be a Christmas tv movie staple for decades to come.&&Just asking because I don't understand but how exactly does 'tracking' work broadly?&&Awesome for Coco, especially since its run has been extended in China! 

Also wonder how the second week of SW8 will be, given the different polarising views of audiences I have read about it online (40% hating it, 40% loving it and 20% having no idea whether to love or hate it).&&I'd be very suprised if the fan reaction carries over to the general public. From what I've read, their complaints mainly relate to ""Star Wars"" issues- how it treats certain characters and plot points- rather than actual flaws in the quality of the film.&&Damn disaster artist didn't even make the list? I loved that movie, I really hope it doesn't bomb.&&I LOVED and HATED it. They pushed Finn into a pointless side story during a terribly boring 18 hour ship chase. That shit isnt compelling. Thats fucking awful and made me want to leave. 

But then you have the 3rd act, and it is haunting, mesmerizing, powerful, beautiful, and pure Star Wars. No dumb jokes to ruin the drama. Just storytelling.&&Amazing number for The Last Jedi. 

Controversial opinion perhaps: I personally thought that Rian Johnson did a very good job with the movie, and I thought it was a better film than The Force Awakens. 

[The hyperspace ship ramming scene was incredible and was one of the best Star Wars scenes ever, IMO.](#spoiler)

*Runs and hides* &&I saw TLJ twice this weekend. I'm a huge SW fan and loved parts of it, and disliked other parts. I did enjoy it more the second time. Not sure what that means, if anything. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&&Well no shit. If you try to open on the same weekend as a movie like Star Wars then you're asking to fail.&&Why even mention Ferdinand in the title, of course it couldn't compete.. opening against Star Wars is complete insanity.  They must have lost the opening day sweepstakes or something.&&""But there's of course something more sinister on the horizon, a dark force known only by the name of...Star Wars Fans.""

Or as they would say ""The REAL Star Wars Fans"" because apparently to them, if you like TLJ you aren't a real fan.  &&Given the half and half reception of the movie I'm interested to see if it has staying power or if the box office tails off much faster then its predecessors.  It is undoubtedly a movie that any fan will see once, but a decline in repeat viewings might coincide with the low user review ratings.&&I can sort of understand the hate for TLJ but I fucking loved it. Except for the Casino and Mary Poppins parts, this is everything that I wanted from Star Wars and Rian Johnson Marriage. I am also definitely hyped for his trilogy.&&Disappointing to see blade runner not doing so well. Fantastic movie.&&RIP Ferdinand. I never got a chance to know you. &&Literally never heard of Ferdinand until just now. Meanwhile I took a dump this morning and was shocked to see a Disney™ Star Wars™ logo on it. Truly marketing geniuses, they are&&$100 million spent on John Cena.


Lol nah I'm playing but animation is expensive, and animators routinely get underpaid so I guess the only positive take away is hopefully the animators got paid.&&I don't know why anyone would think it's a good idea to release a film the same weekend as Star Wars.&&I've heard a lot of great things about this *story* (not this particular movied).  From what I've heard it seems odd to me that the trailer I saw for this consisted of a bull rolling on the ground and making farting noises while wearing gloves.  I don't know about anyone else, but I think fart jokes now a days don't go over as well.  It was weird when I went to see Coco and both Ferdinand and Gnomeo and Juliet both had long fart scenes in the trailers.&&I only saw one trailer for Ferdinand and it was a trailer with the real life actors talking about it.  So after a minute of this ad, I had no idea what Ferdinand was really about (or that it was an animated film).  I guess by seeing the actors say ""I am Ferdinand"", I was supposed to have interest in seeing it.  It was an odd trailer for an animated film.  &&This was a terrible time to release Ferdinand. There was a period from late July to October where this movie could have easily done well, the only kids competition at that time was The Emoji Movie and Lego Ninjago Movie. &&And Coco was really good, too. One of the best Pixar film in awhile. I would never release an animated movie within 3 months of a Pixar movie.&&Yeah. Sounds like a kiddo double feature that us wanna be adults would like.&&And soon, after they buy Fox, Disney will own Ferdinand as well.&&Horror movies are in general a GREAT Return on Investment.&&That movie was an unexpected gem.&&Isn't it a blumhouse movie? They regularly make huge return on investment&&I knew how long it was going to be but it still felt like it had 3 or 4 endings. I'm like, what is this, Return of the King?&&I left the movie feeling like this was an end to the series,  there wasnt anything that really made me wish I could immediately see the next movie, which sadly was a first for me.&&It was long, but at the same time I didn't want it to end. It definitely didn't feel long at least which is all you can hope for&&That's what I loved cause I didn't feel robbed by the end! Usually movies show you so much then cocktail block you at the end with ""till next time!"" bullshit. I actually felt like we got an ending where I'm not begging for another 1-2 hours of movie but rather content with what we got till next year&&Regardless of the reaction to the movie, I think we can all agree that it's strange the movie had almost no dramatic building to Episode 9. 


Absolutely nothing changed in Episode 8 other than the rebel's ranks being depleted. The movie killed the mysteries brought up in Episode 7. There's very little narrative forward momentum going into this last film. &&Yep. Felt like they tied it up pretty well then went “Fuck we forgot the snow battle! Second Star Wars needs snow! Quick get that shit in there!”&&They showed the film with 40 minutes of trailers when we saw it... Stretched it to well over 3 hours. Just too long... &&At this point, Justice League has yet to surpass the box office of the Thor sequel.

Not Ragnarok.  The Dark World.&&More importantly, TLJ *outearned JL's entire domestic gross to date* ($219,456,347) ***in its opening weekend*** ($220,047,000).&&I forgot Justice League even came out.&&If the numbers I saw were correct TLJ has made more domestically in one weekend than JL has made so far in a month domestically. &&For sure. Trailer for Infinity War makes Avengers 1 look like a school play in terms of scope and scale. &&*Infinity War* will have HUGE numbers — had many more views for their trailer in 24hrs than *TLJ* did. But their momentum could come to a halt once *Solo* is released at the end of May. That’s what I’m curious to see. &&Disney has purchased smart. It's that old ""Takes money to make money"" adage.  They saw the success of X-Men, Spiderman (the 2002 one) and Iron Man, and moved to buy out the rest of Marvel's properties in 2009.  It then got Star Wars in 2012.

Disney hasn't ""achieved"" much of anything.  They've just been very smart and opportunistic with their acquisitions.  &&Did she fuck the fish?&&Jealous&&I am actually looking forward to this movie more than any others.&&Does anyone really ever see him?&&*Are you sure about that?*&&How can you even watch what you can't see&&Username checks out. &&To be fair, he was also in the FRED movie as his dad.&&[deleted]&&Obviously you’re forgetting the Christmas Special. /s

In all seriousness, they’re probably including The Clone Wars animated movie.&&Maybe they’re counting the one they did for *The Clone Wars*? Or the 3D run of *The Phantom Menace*. I’m not sure which one it is.&&Came here to ask this. Googled the shit out of it and came up with nothing. Did I somehow miss a Clone Wars movie?&&Going to be a very interesting second weekend.&&It's weird because, even though I think TLJ is a great movie, the whole ""I'm going again to make sure"" mentality is what people had back when the Phantom Menace came out. This is one divisive movie.&&[TLJ haters irl](https://imgur.com/88GY8Qy)&&I've never wanted to see a movie a second time as badly as TLJ. I feel like I've gotten venting about my expectations for Rey/Snoke/etc. out of my system and can enjoy it for what it is next time.&&It is like Comic Book Guy in the Simpsons: ""Worst Cosmic Wars Ever. I would only see it 3 more times. Today.""&&I'm not a big star wars fan. I do like these new ones a lot though. 

I saw TLJ on Thursday, wasn't sure about it. Saw it on Saturday and I loved it, there are some really great moments and I found the scenes with [Rey and Kylo](#spoiler)  to be riveting. 

It also helped me decide that the plot line with [Finn and Rose](#spoiler) was shit haha. 

Also that moment when [the rebel cruiser light jumps into Snoke's ship? Holy SHIT did that look amazing](#spoiler)

There were lots of great moment throughout the film, I really liked it. &&It may be bad in some parts but for the good parts alone it's worth seeing.&&I saw Star Wars, Disaster Artist and Coco this week. Amazing movies, all of them! 

Going to watch Star Wars again tomorrow. In imax! Coco floored me. Went in blind, just impressed so much with Pixar.&&TFA was a once in a generation event, and quiet possibly the last time it happens to Star Wars. &&I won't go deep in reviews at all for a star wars flick, but I'll check the tomatometer. It's not to decide whether or not I see the movie, so much as to manage my expectations with it.&&Gamers have long ago learned that metacritic fan ratings are utterly garbage. RT audience scores appear to be following that trend&&DisneyCoin

^^Inb4 ^^it ^^exists ^^already ^^and ^^I ^^get ^^sent ^^to ^^DisneyJail ^^aka ^^Gooftanamo ^^Bay&&Not that this is a scientific poll, but while I liked the movie and thought it was flawed, my 14 year old says it's the best Star Wars ever and ""really liked how it was done.""  My eight year old described it as ""Epic."". They really want me to take them again and they've never reacted like that with any other movie.&&The online backlash seems to be, in my opinion, limited to parts of the moderate / hardcode SW fandom. I don't think the general public agrees with (or cares about) most of the critiques flying around the interwebs.

I am only basing this off of what I've seen on Reddit / Twitter / etc, so who knows.&&Agreed. I don't think the general audience finds it as polarizing as the online fans do. Maybe it won't have as much staying power at TFA, but it's not going to completely drop. &&Probably a lot less repeat-viewings than TFA though.&&There was a trailer in the USA that practically showed more live action of John Cena (promoting the movie) than the animated movie itself. So over here at least they pushed him pretty hard.&&Sort of a variable of things, from early pre-sales tickets to social media response and search engine traffic. Not a definite science, but usually fairly accurate. &&Re: Episode VIII I think the internet's influence is largely overblown. ""The Internet"" (if you'll allow me to look at it as a singular entity) loved BR2049 and it didn't really help the box office. The hate for the Last Jedi won't really hurt it, I think. But who knows?

All I know is that even though I'm not the hugest fan of the movie, pretty much everyone else in the theater from kids to young couples to older fans were going crazy for it. I think the general audience will really go for this movie despite the backlash from a lot of hardcore fans.&&I'll gladly take that over '100% meh'.&&It got an 'A' Cinemascore, so it seems like people like it overall.&&I think the Finn/Rose storyline was a bit contrived and should have been edited down, but I think back to it, especially with the busy-body, and that it was a semi-homage to the Mos Eisley cantina... but in a different way that was different from the one run by Maz Kanata... and pushed forward one of the themes of the film: failure and granted-taking. In previous films, things always seemed to work out for the heroes, conveniently. In this one? All bets were off and it was showing that sometimes you gotta play the hand you are dealt. &&That's the thing about the movie though, it really does have amazing scenes but those scenes don't connect to each other well.&&Most of the issues I had with the film were due to JJ Abrams setting up a bunch of “mysteries” that we didn’t really need. It’s also because of Abrams’ story that Luke abandoned his friends and was hiding on an island with a bunch of frog-nuns. Johnson did a good job of untangling all that after 7 (a film which I liked, don’t get me wrong, but it left the story in a difficult spot.)&&Crazy that it's a controversial opinion to call a pretty good movie good. &&Oh I completely agree with you that it was a better film than TFA. TFA, in my opinion, simply felt like a nostalgia-fest with it's reintroduction of the Millennium Falcon, Han, Chewee, Leia, Luke, and just the general ""epic space battle vibe"" that constitutes Star Wars movies whose only purpose was to reinvigorate the populaces passion (and nostalgia) for the Star Wars franchise. Meanwhile, TLJ felt like a movie that deviated from the norm just enough to keep it unique but still entertaining. TLJ felt exciting, new, and while it wasn't perfect (why was it so long??) I thoroughly enjoyed it and left the theater even more excited for the future of the franchise than I did after watching TFA.&&I saw it on opening night and felt pretty indifferent. I guess I definitely LIKED it, but I didn’t love it or anything. I haven’t seen it a second time yet but I bet if I did I would like it quite a bit more. I just don’t know if I want to sit through the first act again&&I think the fact that it wasn't very straightforward at all may play to repeat viewings as people try to go back and track the parallels.&&Almost poetic it suffered the same fate as the original. &&Illumination produces movies for $75 million, and their movies have a much bigger box office take. But then, they might be paying under, I don't know any of that... but this seems way too expensive for the output, unless Cena got a large portion.&&The experimental technology to render John Cena visible was really expensive.&&I feel bad for the people at Blue Sky.  All the uncertainty about what will happen to them with Disney buying Fox, and now this.  

The *Ice Age* franchise seems to have run its course, no one is clamoring for a third *Rio* movie, and they said from the start that *The Peanuts Movie* (which I loved) was a one-off.  What else do they have?&&Animated feature just cost a lot to make. Hundreds of animators making lots of money, working on a film for 3 to 5 years. I think Blue Sky is like Disney and Pixar, all of their animation is done at their home studio. Burbank for Disney (although Zootopia was in Studio City because they were renovating the Burbank studio), Emeryville for Pixar, and Greenwich, CN for Blue Sky. These studios don’t offshore animation. And their animators aren’t the underpaid ones. 

Many animators are underpaid. They get stuck on crappy production where half of the movie is offshored. Many animators work movie to movie, with big layoffs and big hiring between productions, and lots of animators get desperate and work for cheap on crappy productions when they don’t get picked back up. They need to keep their portfolios fresh for the next hiring, even if that means long hours at low pay. 

Big studios don’t do that. They keep their animators and automatically have them moved to a new production once the old production has wrapped. They have a whole team of people whose jobs are to figure out where to move animators between production so there’s no downtime. So those animators don’t get underpaid (and they’re all unionized). &&I work at a theater. Can confirm the only people who saw Ferdinand where the ones who didn't want to waste a trip when they saw Star Wars sold out&&Maybe a Christmas themed movie... maybe. &&Counter-programming. 

Kids too young to see lightsaber action? How about a goofy cartoon that plays it safe?&&Maybe it offers an easy excuse for a bomb?&&[deleted]&&Fart jokes are fine, but they serve a very specific audience. I love a good fart joke, but it's not gonna convince me to spend the money on a night at the movies. Young boys are the only ones I could see this working with, and if I was a parent, I wouldn't imagine it being too hard to convince them to wanna see Coco instead.&&They were pushing John Cena so hard as the lead. Imo, you shouldn't base an animated movie off the cast, but off the story.&&Considering its also a hispanic themed movie it wouldve paired well.&&In early October there was only the My Little Pony movie for kids movies, they should have released it then. &&Kids movies leg out ridiculous multiples during the holidays.  Opening weekend gross is much less important.  It will likely see its grosses rise next weekend.  Still I don't think this movie would be profitable at any release date.&&To be fair, Coco's success and domination weren't expected at these levels.&&That's why we got so many Paranormal activities. They cost pennies to make and have big returns.

I think the original has the best ROI of any movie ever. I may be wrong though&&Was it? I haven't seen it yet but the trailer made it look like a fun ride. It looked like a groundhog day/end of tomorrow mixture.&&Return of the last Jedi, Again.&&That cracked me up. I remember watching it for the first time and was like how many endings are there? They tied up literally every loose end there was.&&This movie didn't answer any of the questions that TFA brought up. It's dumb of them to set up the next generation when they haven't even done anything with this one.&&Well A New Hope ends on a pretty good note and it could have easily been the end. Nobody imagined they would make a sequel let alone have it be one of the best movies ever made.&&Found it really disappointing overall. So many missed opportunities I feel. More than once something cool could happen but didnt for no reason. Felt like this was a film not made by a star wars fan.&&Yeah I kept thinking ""wow this is long.. which is good this movie is awesome""&&If was waiting for it to end. Maybe I'm getting too old for this, but everything about this movie was pretty uninteresting to me.&&>cocktail block

""sorry, movie's over for you but have this gin and tonic I made""&&Definitely feels like they could have used some of that side-plot screentime to hint a bit about [where the hell the Knights of Ren are.](#spoiler)&&Wasn't it salt? But yea, it was very Hoth-ish.&&[deleted]&&Trailers are fine, but not when the length is doubled by commercials &&Jesus. You mean the Thor sequel I know I watched but literally can't recall anything about? &&Oh wow&&Ouch. That's just salt in the wound.&&Good payback for Synder shit talking it back when Man of Steel was coming out.&&Lmao, I remember an interview form like 2011 where Zack Snyder said something along the lines of “the fact that we’re getting a Thor movie before a Justice League movie is ridiculous, and I’m going to do something about it.”

Cut to present- the third Thor movie is one of the standouts in a year filled with amazing superhero movies, and meanwhile Justice League is universally panned and probably isn’t going to make their budget back.&&There is a running joke among the heads of Marvel Studios that The Dark World is their crowning achievement and the most complex masterpiece they have ever produced. 

*Maybe they're not wrong.*&&> Not Ragnarok.  The Dark World.

I’m crying right now. I did not expect to hear that today lmao 😂&&Holy crap. Now that was a forgettable movie. This is so embarassing for DC.&&Now that's some perspective right there. &&That’s really sad. I’m a massive DC comic book fan and that just makes me shake my head in disappointment. &&What really blows my hair back is how much money the THIRD Thor movie made compared to the projected total for JL. That's gotta sting for WB/DC.

It was supposed to be their flagship superhero team-up movie and they couldn't even come close to Thor 3.  2 years ago it probably seemed like a slam dunk.&&I'm a Batman cosplayer and I forgot it came out. &&Dude really. I watched coco yesterday and while walking out I saw the door for justice league and I was like ""oh yeah. That's a thing.""

I really don't give a flying fuck about the DC movies. Zero interest in any them. &&With multiple comic movies a year, it just feels like this years COD or Madden &&That just says to me that Justice League made way more money than it deserved to.&&> Trailer for Infinity War makes Avengers 1 look like a school play in terms of scope and scale.

Makes you wonder how they're going to utilize the full cast without making the movie feel like a chain of cameos rather than a coherent storyline.&&Made it look like Shakespeare in the Park.&&I'm still expecting Solo to be pushed to December. &&I don't know man, anecdotally I haven't seen much buzz for Solo with the people I interact with day-to-day.&&Domestically yes, but unlike Star Wars China fuckin loves The Avengers ($240 million for Age of Ultron).&&> had many more views for their trailer in 24hrs than TLJ did

It's worth remembering that Star Wars probably has a lot more older fans than Avengers does. The difference in YouTube views could be more down to demographics than the actual number of fans.&&How is it possible that Solo will be released in 5 months, and there has not even been a teaser trailer yet?&&Either way, Disney wins May, I don't think they will be disappointed. But *Solo* will be closer to Rogue One, and will already have passed the first few weeks of Avengers I think the Avengers movie might be similar to The Last Jedi, I think there might be more hype now than *Age of Ultron*&&They turned around a dormant Star Wars franchise. &&Yup. Full penetration shot and everything. And that fish dude is fucking hung.&&She did fuck the fish. But you don't see it. You do get to see her nude though. &&🚫🎺🎺🎺🎺🚫&&His last name is technically spelled ""see? nah.""&&That's why he voice acted it.&&He's already won several awards and it's up for a couple of Golden Globes. I expect at least one Oscar nom.&&I tracked that Christmas special down a few years ago.

I didn't finish it. Some things should stay buried.&&[deleted]&&Animated, yes 👍 &&well, I'm going again soon just to make sure.&&It has Christmas Eve to contend with


Edit: Christmas Eve is a notoriously bad day at the box office. It’s a fact. It’s not an opinion. TLJ’s second weekend will be hurt by this fact. Its Christmas Day Monday, however, will be boosted.

Edit2: As a bonus you can see 2014's across the board Christmas Eve drop [here](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2014-12-24&track=starwars2016.htm&p=.htm)&&Could you or someone explain (spoiler free) what makes this movie so divisive? &&That Trekkie gif is like salt in the wound. Love it. &&Lol so true though!  No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans.&&That was how I felt going into my second viewing, and I really loved it the second time.&&Yeah, I'm going for my second round this weekend.  I really really enjoyed it, but I want to see how knowing the twists beforehand will affect it on repeat viewings.&&I liked it way more the second time. I think it's because the meat of the story I actually really enjoyed, the dumb humour and unnecessary scenes just ruined it for me. But when you already know they're coming, they don't ruin the flow as much.

I'd probably have given it a 5/10 on first viewing, second time it was at least an 8.&&That's what I thought. The good parts were terrific, but the bad parts were REALLY bad. There didn't seem like much of an ""in-between"" with this movie, the part was either good or bad.&&Most movies have the same plot over and over.

This one had a few moments I could have never predicted.&&I'm going for Coco tomorrow, half because I wanted to see it and half because I wanted to wait for the Frozen short to be removed.

I really want to see the Disaster Artist but no theatre near me is playing it! If I wanted to see it I would have to travel to Toronto. :(&&I think it's interesting because the divide I'm seeing is that casual movie fans (like your kids) and hardcore *movie* fans (""cinephiles"", critics, etc.) are pretty much in agreement of this being great, while people that are mostly hardcore *Star Wars* fans - not necessarily cinephiles in general - are the divided audience.

EDIT: I'm generalizing people. These are trends I've noticed. I get it, you loved it and love Star Wars and movies. You hated it but you love movies and not Star Wars. Your aunt Sally who hates everything has attended 10 times just to see BB-9E's scenes. You're all special but I *don't care*.&&I've noticed the dislike comes from the biggest Star Wars fans. While I'm in the fan camp, this is the 9th live action star wars flick, I was up for something changing in the mix.

I really think the hate is fueled by fans not getting what they expected.&&It was going to always have less. The force awakens was coming off a ""no star wars for a long time"" bonus and the curiosity of what disney would being to the star wars universe. So you had curiousity, fandom, and a marketing giant fueling the viewings. This movie, pretty much everything is a known commodity - how disney makes a star wars movie and what to generally expect. It's also a sequel, which generally rates lower than the original movie. Most of those factors generally lead to lower gross. Plus I don't think you can really top the insane hype that the force awakens had.&&I’m actually expecting *more* repeat viewings, from fans who “just have to make sense of it” or whatever. If there’s anything Star Wars fans love, it’s rewatching the movies to find more flaws. It also has MoviePass on its side this time. &&Personally I saw TFA once and never had any reason to go see it again, whereas I want to see TLJ about 2 more times to process it lol&&That's interesting because over at Rotten Tomatoes only 56% of audience liked it, with an avg rating of 3.3/5.

Is there a brigading situation happening with the audience scores on RT?

This is one of the more dramatic discrepancies between critics scores and audience scores I've seen for a blockbuster film.  Usually these >90% critic score <60% audience rating movies are critically-lauded films with no attempt at audience appeal.
&&This absolutely. It’s undeniably a beautiful movie with some epic scenes. The movie has fundamental problems in terms of story, script and unnecessary humour as well as some cliches though.&&Some people calling it terrible and others calling it one of the best films of the year makes me even more excited to go see it.

Largely divided opinions make for a fun movie, if anything.&&That's the reason I'm seeing it again. I saw The Force Awakens so many times cause it was so much fun but this I feel like I need to see it another time to fully develop my feelings towards certain aspects I was a little muddy on in my initial Star Wars hypenight.&&The style of their animation is super cheap. At a first glance they look up to par with other animated movies, but look closer and you'll see the same assets being reused in their films and stuff like that.&&> unless Cena got a large portion.

I'd expect he did. He's probably a savvy enough business guy (politicking in wrestling is huge), he has a pretty good control of his image, and Cena seems pretty popular with a younger crowd. I'm not in a big WWE market but when I take the bus I see kids with Cena merch pretty often, especially after WWE has been in town. 

I can bet some executives did the math and figured kids would beg to see the Cena animated movie.

But I can also bet kids don't care too much about who the voice actor is in their animated movies. I always assumed the point of getting big name voice actors is to give your movie a sense of credibility with the parents that will be dragged to see a kids movie. &&Illumination operates under the idea of making animated movies as cheap as possible, so they're not a fair comparison&&\>minions&&They had to invent an algorithm that divides by zero and resolves just to ensure that he was visible.&&I hadn't seen that Peanuts was a one-off. That's disappointing, I thought it was spot on.&&I see only 2 real outcomes for Blue Sky Studios. Either Disney turns them into a sort of Illumination clone, pumping out cheaply made animated movies with decent stories backed by huge advertising campaigns.....or Disney simply shut's it down. 

Blue Sky never really put out a real animation masterpeice, their only decent movies were Ice Age, Rio, Peanuts Movie, and Horton Hear's a Who. &&they could try some original IP&&There is a second Rio movie? Wtf I just checked and there are 7 Ice Age movies.

I just didn't see anything about them, completely escaped my radar.&&Well it's a strategy.&&I work at a theater as well and we had loads of people coming to see Ferdinand. It didn't do nearly as well as Star Wars obviously, but it definitely has an audience.&&A kid's movie still would have done better in January with relatively little competition&&Non mainstream movies would do fine in my opinion, anything aimed at kids or teenagers is going to fail though&&Young girls too. From age 4-8 farts are fucking Oscar worthy. Gender makes little difference until later. &&I know it's probably a little self-righteous or whatever, but damn do I hate low-rent  toilet humor.&&And yet it can't really shrug off the ultimate Hispanic movie, Coco.&&I thought the movie was pretty decent but they just picked THE WORST time for opening weekend. &&It's the highest grossing animated film in Mexican history&&I think you are right, it made 195 or so million on a 15000 dollar budget.&&It's Groundhog Day as a murder mystery. There's actually a joke about that at the end of the movie. &&That is accurate. I feel like it was an entertaining movie that didn't try to be really deep or serious, just a little scary and whodunnit. Like, Get Out this is not. But it is funny and scary. Great popcorn flick.&&Part deux&&Well except for the whole defeating the bad guys part.&&Yeah, I felt that. The  passing to the next generation was fine in theory, but MAN it was heavy handed and cheesy. They raised fun world building questions that made these new characters interesting in TFA (Rey, Finn, Snoke, and Kylo in particular) only to not answer them and kind of shit on the audience for even asking them. I feel like they really mishandled legacy characters to advance and prioritize new ones, which was just bad writing.&&I agree. I wished they would have focused on finishing this story before trying to weasel in the future of the franchise.. I didn't hate this movie but I did leave feeling a bit deflated and unsure if i liked it or not.&&Same but at the same time I wanted it to end cause I really needed to pee&&Like the dark knight?  How much more can happen!&&We know it was salt thanks to Lieutenant Plot Exposition who tasted it and exclaimed, “Salt!”&&I didn’t mind, I thought the salt looked real pretty&&Facts. Rose was just forced.   
  
Also the red and white was used to show Luke didnt leave footprints ;)&&Not even battle...just lectured him...&&There was all that loopy, Mjolnir-flying-through-portals fun, though!&&It's that one where Thor ~~loses his hand~~ is completely fine.&&I remember Loki being 110% Loki and a bunch of jumping through portals during the final battle. That is all.&&DC cinematic universe is pretty much dead right now, too much mistrust from so many terrible movies and I imagine the management structure of those with rights to the properties is too corrupted by stupidity. 

They were given an amazing platform and direction by some of the best flat-out movies of all time, the Nolan Batman trilogy, and what they've done with it could only be described as a monstrous abortion in the most pleasant of terms.&&See, if Snyder wasnt so much of a fucking snob and was more open about it, he'd be like ""If Marvel can make a successful Thor movie, why dont we try to make a Shazam movie.""

Also i hate to reiterate what everyone is saying but if they didn't rush straight into Justice League within 4 years of Man of Steel, DCEU would still be salvageable.&&Man, I do feel for you. There's no reason why characters with such a rich, celebrated history should do so poorly. Really hope WB and TW straighten out this mess.&&If it makes you feel any better my favorite Marvel comics are probably Inhumans and Iron Fist. &&Warner Brothers just has no idea what they're doing. They should have stuck to what they were good at, and not tried to compete with Marvel one-for-one, but instead, gone with an asymmetric strategy. Theatrical *Animated* features!

They should have handed the reins over to people like Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, and Paul Dini, years ago, and brought in their best writing talent from the comic book side to consult. It's not like they're lacking for talent and source material.

Stop trying to be Marvel. You're not Marvel. You're Warner Bros./DC. You have a long and storied history as one of the greatest animation houses in history. You can figure out how to make half a billion dollars with LEGO, but you don't know what to do Superman and Batman?

You guys made Mask of the Phantasm. It was never planned for theatrical release, made with a small budget, had very little advertising, which killed it at the box office, and is now a criminally underviewed cult classic. It's arguably the best Batman movie, and, all around a fantastic animated film.

Do that, but don't half-ass it.&&I don’t have anything against DC but they can’t get a movie right to save their ass.&&DC's been cursed with great content but shit directors..

&&Snyder in 2000:

>“[Superman] is the freaking […] biggest superhero on the planet. He’s the father of every superhero. [Deborah and I] were just talking about this – I’m like, really? Thor? Thor has a movie? [Laughter.] Really? I mean, come on. And there’s no Superman movie? This is, like, the world’s out of balance. It’s like, we’ve lost our minds here, people, come on.”&&Also there are so many high billed actors in it how are they ever going to make money and pay all of them&&They are telling their story over two movies released, what, a year apart? So they have 5 hours (I think assuming each part is 2 and a half hours is reasonable) to do this. I'm assuming the plan is they'll pick out what are the major character conflicts that need resolution (obviously Iron Man, Cap, and Bucky will be a big one for the first movie) and that for less important arc the idea will be token resolutions tied into that bigger arc or to add wrinkles into existing characterization that can be tackled in the solo movies.

That's my bullshit guess, but that'll probably effectively dictate how they utilize the cast as a whole. Ant Man, as an example, will get screen time, but in terms of meat, how expanded will it be from his appearance in Civil War?&&Why did you quote his entire comment in your comment if you were replying to it anyway?&&Or that Matt Damon Loki play&&When I see 5 weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in the middle of the park in full view of 100 people, I shoot the bastards. That's my policy.&&doth mother knoweth you weareth her drapes? &&I thought that's a given considering the circumstances&&Based on all the drama I’ve heard about behind the scenes, most of us are predicting that Solo is gonna be a train wreck.&&Because it's just unnecessary. You would think with the prequels they'd learn not everything needs a back story, but gotta keep milking that cow for all it's worth I guess. &&Donald Glover is literally the only thing that's going to get me to walk into that theater and pay $10 in May. I'm a pretty big Star Wars fan but I would honestly have skipped this one otherwise&&As long as they dont put black panther on the poster ads&&There's also fans like me that did not watch a single Star Wars video prior to watching TLJ. The Marvel movies pull the majority of its content from the comics so there's not as much fear of big spoilers on the trailers. &&Wow, I just assumed it was coming out in December 2018. Had no clue it was set to release in May. The fact that there isn't a trailer yet for its May release makes me think they're definitely going to push back the release date. Plus, it doesn't make much sense to cannibalize their own movies and release it so close to The Avengers: Infinity War&&If it gets a trailer this week, then it'll be like Infinity War (3 weeks ago it got a trailer, it releases 3 weeks before Solo).     
That being said, I would not be surprised if it gets pushed back to Christmas. &&Because Lucasfilm doesn't release teasers until after the next Star Wars movie has been released. They probably don't want *Solo* distracting from *The Last Jedi.* They did the same thing with *The Force Awakens* and *Rogue One* (though there was more time between those two movies).&&Simply because a trailer for another Star Wars movie right now would just confuse audiences. I would bet we dont see anything for it till February or March after TLJ has run it's course.&&Not sure if serious but now I want to see this movie. &&jebaited &&I can hear this comment&&I saw the Best of the Worst episode about the Christmas Special, they show like 2 minutes of footage from it and that's enough for ten lifetimes.&&Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.&&I better go again too so I can whine about it more &&I loved it, but guess I should go again to make sure to!&&im going again just because i loved it. okay canto bight aside, i loved it.&&Alot of people dont know what to do during the holidays anyways and watch movies becaause having all your estranged relatives over is weird sometimes.&&Here's most of the things I've noticed being repeated across Reddit and other social media;

* Pacing issues, particularly in the first act
* The subplot with Finn and Rose is somewhat pointless
* Some character inconsistencies, particularly with Luke
* A few of the loose ends from The Force Awakens are subverted very unexpectedly, leaving a lot of fans kinda pissed off

I can look past a lot of the problems because I feel they worked in a self-contained movie, but I guess when considered as part of the entire saga, it might leave a lot to be desired.

> EDIT: The humour irked a lot of fans too.&&Data reaches across the Star [Blank] aisle, he's that awesome.&&*spits* salt&&Cannot wait for TLJ reaction gif of the ""Salt"" line&&Funny to find this statement in reply to a Star Trek gif, we say the same thing on /r/startrek &&[deleted]&&Idk how to spoiler tag but spoilers don't keep reading if you haven't seen




I really felt like the bombing run in the beginning was absolutely incredible.  But how Leia lived being blasted into space made 0 sense. &&I didn't think any parts were REALLY bad. Just uninteresting. It's not like Jar Jar Binks [showed up from underneath a Praetorian guard outfit and said ""Wesa get outta here okieday?""](#spoiler)&&You'll really enjoy Coco I think. It was what I was hoping Kubo and the two strings would be, but wasn't.&&This is a good observation. I'm a hardcore cinephile and a hardcore Star Wars fan and I loved it. It comes down to expectations. I did not want to see just Luke fucking shit up for 3 hours; I wanted a film.&&I'm not a cinephile, but I'm not filthy casual. I'm also not nostalgic for Star Wars, since I didn't see it until High School, and started with the original trilogy.

I have found people in my grouping feel the same about it. Had great moments, but realized it's huge flaws. &&Fans had built up these wild expectations to the mystery boxes that JJ left (which is a lazy way to get people caring about your movie, by the way), and then they got mad that Johnson didn't have the same concern or care for the mystery boxes.

[I liked that Rey's parents were just nobodies. The idea that every great Jedi has to be a descendant of Anakin Skywalker completely goes against the message of the original trilogy about regular people doing extraordinary things and the consequence of your birth having nothing to do with your potential. It's also not like they actually hinted that her parents were some well-known bad asses or anything, that was just an expectation that fans created for themsleves.](#spoiler)&&Plus TFA was the first true sequel to the original trilogy and had the original actors. You just can't top that much hype. &&Can't you only see a movie once with moviepass?&&Yea, TFA was completely straightforward...I can't think of anything in it that I thought was ambiguous.

TLJ is the opposite if anything. Lot of shit happened, and I'm still not sure what I think about parts of it. Was that fucking brilliant, or was it wholly pointless? Over and over again things fail to work out the way they're *supposed* to...That's fucking bold.&&I can't say for certain that there's a brigading situation but it's a lot easier to astroturf an online review site with people who haven't seen it or fake accounts than it is to brigade a system that asks people in person as they're leaving the theater.&&[deleted]&&This so much. This is my new favorite way to describe it.

Because you do walk out with ""man...X was EPIC... this other scene was sooo epic!"" but then you had so many scenes in the middle that were ""... why?!"" Like why they were insistent on cutting tension with shitty jokes over and over.  

Like you said, the story and script were very  ""meh..."" but several scenes were just so well done, and felt so grandiose, that you walk out SO torn on how you feel about it.

Ive never watched a movie that had me so ""OMG! I loved...and hated it""&&The audience score on RT is shockingly low for a blockbuster film, and especially for one with such a high critic's score.&&My daughter absolutely loves ""Rio"", and it didn't take me long to realize that every human in the movie is one of about 10 designs.

Edit: I understand that Rio is Blue Sky not Illumination, but it is true for both studios.&&I'm sorry but I don't see how this would be possible.  Most of the people in avengers make like 6-10 million with the exception of RDJ who gets a % of everything I believe.  No way could a movie with that big a budget and a big portion of it being for Cena.  It's voice acting for crying out loud.  He should make no more then a few million dollars I would think.  &&I've been passing down my fascination with voices and voice actors to my daughter. She's actually starting to tell me that x character sounds like y and we'll look it up if we don't know, or discuss differences in accent and things. She's actually found her first ""I know that voice"" guy across multiple properties and it's amusing. &&It was lovely. We picked it up for our Peanuts obsessed kid and for my husband and I to have a nostalgia bomb (though we had low expectations). Other than a few weird voice takes, it was really impressive imo. &&I guess Disney could sell Blue Sky to another studio (while keeping the rights to Ice Age for itself).  Does Paramount have an animation division?  

The Empire already has DisneyToon studios for lower budget animation, like the Planes movies.&&Ice age was so amazing though. And I still see Merch for it. I wonder if they only
release at these times because it’s cheaper to and they just want sell other things&&Or not release at the same time as Star Wars&&Right, I feel like it is one that would have paid off a lot better back before there was such a push towards preselling tickets, and so much hype about the fact that star wars sold out in hours.&&It’ll likely have a decent Christmas break attendance. Animated movies tend to do well then. I’m not saying it’s Frozen, but at my local theater Frozen was hardly busy until Christmas break and then exploded&&Yeah it might just be the nose in the air but it kills a movie for me. It's basically the reason I refuse to watch a movie that features Melissa McCarthy.&&Coming out before it probably would have helped a bit.&&[deleted]&&Reloaded&&Take a look at Blade Runner 2049 and see good writing IMO and how to do things the right way with characters after 30+ years. That movie should be exhibit A on how to sideline the original main characters (Deckard) as now, supporting, while also building up new characters by making them just as interesting and also keeping up the themes of the original and giving the original characters a nice, consistent story arc in a long movie. This movie failed in that regard and instead acted like this was the ONLY way to write them. I didn't even have fan theories but you can't tell me that Snoke, Phasma, and Luke (this is debatable but I feel he is) aren't wasted.&&Seriously. I was like ""come on bladder, you can hold out a bit longer!""&&It's called a catheter you filthy casual&&Excuse me, his name was Sergeant Salty.

Edit : and no, [I'm not kidding. ](https://i.imgur.com/QVvpzJB.png)&&He was a brave soul, never knew what became of him because no one explicitly explained it... Maybe in the next movie &&They had already called the place a ""mineral planet"", too. I think it would have been much cooler if they had just let fans realize on their own, maybe not until after the movie, that that was salt and not sand. There was more than enough hints in the scenes there.&&Wait... What? How did i miss that!?!?&&Fact: Finn dragged Rose about 4-5 miles while the First Order and its walkers just watched.

And before you ask, this is before Luke showed up.&&MEW MEW!&&I've always wanted a strong DC Film Universe. They should have had it easy because DC has DECADES of solid stories on which to build. The animated DC universe was like a proof of concept that millennials grew up on. They could have just ran with that. WB really showed their true colors in how they mismanaged the DCEU. It should have been an easy win with the right talent involved. &&I agree. They tried to jump direct to what should have been the 6-7th movie. And that cost them. This universe is neither dark nor humourous, just since wierd shade of grey&&The Nolan trilogy, albeit amazing on its own, was the worst thing for the DCU.  Because every movie after, they had this weird idea was that dark and brooding was what works.  They didn’t realize that that only works for Batman.  And they let that misplaced belief ruin the entire series.&&Avengers (2012) happened 4 years after Iron Man (2008). Avengers was the sixth movie (IM, Hulk, IM2, Thor, CA:TFA, Avengers) and Justice League was the fifth (MoS, SS, BvS, WW, JL)

The problem isn't the amount of time or movies that WB spent before Justice League, but that they didn't spend the time properly introducing us to the characters. Suicide Squad had nothing to do with Justice League and more than half of BvS is spent on Lex Luthor constructing a reason for Batman and Superman to fight. Which means we effectively had 2.5 movies to introduce and make us care about Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. The first three were actually well established, but only Cyborg of the last three were properly handled and Superman was missing for most of JL and when he did pitch up they had to retcon him into a nice guy instead of broody Superman. So our last two heroes are totally underdeveloped, then the villain still had to be introduced, their plan and motivations explained and two battles shown

They run out of time because they didn't plan the character arcs properly. The secret to a team up movie is that all the characters need to be where they need to be development wise *before* they team up. If you have to waste half the movie making a character into what they need to be for the team, then you'll lose out somewhere else. If you haven't even introduced all your characters before the movie, it just makes it worse

Marvel had Black Widow and Hawkeye in Avengers without giving them their own films, but they had been in Iron Man 2 and Thor respectively so we had gotten to know BW well enough and Hawkeye was written into the plot in a way that the movie itself made up for his motivations when added to his shallow background. In Avengers he's essentially jist a secret agent who's friends with Black Widow, then he gets brain controlled and after being released he's out for revenge (until an alien army invades and everyone HAS to fight). This IMO is also why a lot of Age of Ultron focuses on fleshing him out more

This became more of an essay than intended, so TL;DR: Marvel avoided the pitfalls by setting up characters before hand and limiting the amount of characters that needed development in Avengers while WB tried to introduce or develop the entire team in Justice League and then still had to focus on the villain and plot&&Pretty sure he was following WB's agenda. They wanted JL fast. That meant ""Dawn of the JL --> JL"" right after MoS. I'd argue that we needed WW, Aquaman, Flash, then a Batman standalone or mix with Superman, before a JL.&&Always disliked Snyder's attitude since Watchmen was coming out and an interviewer asked him about Alan Moore disowning it. He said words to the effect of ""Worst case scenario he watches the DVD in his flat in London and it isn't his thing. No big deal."" Like in Snyder's own mind the most hated his films can be still involve purchasing and watching them. Also Moore lives somewhere far up North of London. 

I don't dislike his film as much as others. Justice League is okay. But dude has a bit of an ego.&&They've got to stop using Zack Snyder.  He's not a great director/filmmaker.&&I can think of several reasons why it did poorly. 

Man Of Steel

Batman vs Superman

Suicide Squad

Wonder Woman

I enjoy DC heroes in cartoons/comics far more than Marvel ones and the only film of those I saw in the cinema was Man of Steel. I saw the others on TV/blueray.&&You mean Danny Rand, the immortal Iron Fist and sworn enemy of the hand?&&Aww buddy, sorry for your troubles. &&Now we know you're lying, no one likes the Inhumans.&&I think the problem is their studio structure. Marvel studios isn't ran like a film studio, it's ran just like the comic book company. Kevin Feige is Editor-in-Chief and he simply assembles the talent to flesh out his game plan. But he calls the shots. Who calls the shots at WB? It's just a bunch of suits making demands and butchering films, with no one with an ounce of comic acumen to step in and say what works and what doesn't. They lack vision. &&When your video games have better stories and acting, and then get turned *into* great comic books, but your movies can't, you've got a really weird problem. Like, Arkham City and Injustice were great. Then the Injustice comic was even better and the Arkham animated movie did the Suicide squad perfectly before the live action movie was made. TBH there animated movies were amazing until they rebooted to try to create an ongoing universe too, it seems they're just missing some sort of Fiege figure to make things mesh. Maybe Geoff Johns hasn't had enough time to make the difference, but something has to change.&&I would assume most of them are in an overall deal and so their prices aren't as high for the avengers movies where they have less days shooting.&&The first Avengers made over one billion dollars, I don't think that paying actors is going to be a problem &&I read somewhere that Infinity War and Avengers 4 (the two movies are being filmed and edited back to back from what I understand) have an estimated combined budget of 1 *billion* dollars. I imagine most of that is going to actor salaries, and the rest is going to special effects.&&My guess is the first movie will be about reconciling the two Avengers factions. They’ll attack separately, get their asses beaten, realize the power of friendship and how to work together as a team, and it ends with Cap saying “Avengers Assemble” for the first time.

Second one they’ll create like a Power Rangers style megazord mish mash of all their powers to punch Thanon in the face.&&This was my favorite cameo in all Marvel lol, so unexpected.&&It makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughy Nurses 2!&&That was a Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar, you moron! You killed 5 actors! Good ones!&&Joss sure knows how to quip a quip.&&What circumstances? &&Wong in the forefront on every poster. I’d watch it &&Spoiler stakes are also nothing compared to Star Wars, no one wants to have the Darth Vader moment spoiled but there's nothing like that to Marvel&&I did the same, I didnt want even a hint of what was going on. I limited myself to 2 trailers because I wanted to be blown away by the movie without having expectations. That ended up working out beautifully because overall I really enjoyed it&&Star Wars is a different animal.  The Rogue One and The Last Jedi trailers were both released almost 8 months prior to premiere, and The force awakens was over an entire year prior.  Being within 5 months and having no teaser is bad news bears.&&Adam Driver is so good.&&And what better way to break that weirdness than a trip to the movies?&&Honestly, as somebody who really didn’t like the Finn/Rose subplot (I didn’t even like Rose as a character) I find the complaint that their subplot was “pointless” a little strange. Sure, it was inconsequential in terms of plot development, but I don’t think it was ever really about that. I think it was about building suspense and developing Finn’s character. Someone in a different thread reminded me that in TFA, Finn really didn’t have any true allegiance to the Resistance and that he never had any reason to in this one either. I think there was even a line somewhere about “we can’t fight because we hate what we’re against. We have to fight because we love what we are fighting for” (not verbatim). Finn was only ever fighting because he hated the first order, not because he wanted peace in the galaxy (or at least not primarily). So Rose was written as this way to show Finn that this whole thing is bigger than just him and Rey. This is kinda similar to how the purple haired commander lady was written in as a foil to Poe to help teach him a lesson. Although I ultimately agree that it wasn’t necessary for the plot, i think it was setting us up for a whole different Finn in Episode IX.&&Ahhh. Thank you for the great response&&You forgot the humour. The ever-existing scene-ruining Marvel-esque humor.&&>The humour irked a lot of fans too.

That's an understatement. Disney cannot stand to make a single serious scene without adding some sort of joke or visual gag. It's absolutely disgusting. The Rogue One ending is the closest we'll ever get to a serious moment in new Star Wars.&&> A few of the loose ends from The Force Awakens are subverted very unexpectedly, leaving a lot of fans kinda pissed off

Shouldnt that be a *good* thing?
&&Now there's a gif that I need right this very minute.&&Im laughing because this backlash by fans is so similar to what we went through when Discovery came out. 

I liked both this film and that TV show. Maybe I'm weird. &&I think they could cut like 30 minutes out of the film and it would be greatly improved.&&Yea. I'm still laughing at that part. ""I'm half dead, but I'm going to propel myself through space with the Force."" 

No. &&That's a good recommendation, I really loved Kubo last year, I was sad to hear it didn't do well&&I've always said that these new movies are not marketed to the ""hardcore"" Star Wars fan. Disney wants to establish its own universe which is why they cut 99% of the EU and made that into legends because there was just too much stuff going on there. I took my friend who has only seed the movies and he thought TLJ was amazing, my brother who is your typical EU purists will hate this movie more than he did TFA. &&I'm noticing too that people who avoided trailers and the like seemed to like the film more for some reason- maybe we didn't get too much into our own expectations?&&It was fantastic that Hamill Himself said that.  ""Do you expect me to just go out there with a ... laser sword ... and cut things up?"" 

*grumps away furiously*

His character direction was beautiful.  He finally understood his first lesson.  ""Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter."" &&I'm shocked that there are more hardcore fans than me. I cried like 3 times in that film. Loved it.&&That's what I wanted :(&&and it was specially formulated to be a nostalgia machine, from the marketing to the New Hope quasi-remake pacing.

It was designed to be Pepsi's taste test. Win on extra sugar, knowing it wouldn't hold up over the long haul.&&A couple years ago, but you can repeat viewings these days with it.&&once per day, im about to see the last jedi for the third time because yeah...freedom&&Yeah it took a lot more risks and chances than Abrams TFA (which is ridiculously safe) but I still found it a bit formulaic at times (the whole Finn x Rose part being that). I thought it was a fun movie but nothing really that special. 

Though Adam Driver had a fucking great performance and Kylo Ren is one of the best characters in star wars (he's what Anakin should have been).&&Metacritic audience scores are equally atrocious. 4.9 audience score, with an 86 critic score. 

It's one of the largest discrepancies I've seen.

I saw the film yesterday, and the would probably give it a 6/10. Which is odd, as many of my favourite critics loved it. I suppose there's no replacement for watching a film yourself, but I don't have time to watch them all.&&Exactly! I loved and HATED it. They pushed Finn into a pointless side story during a terribly boring 18 hour ship chase. That shit isnt compelling. Thats fucking awful and made me want to leave. 

But then you have the 3rd act, and it is haunting, mesmerizing, powerful, beautiful, and pure Star Wars. No dumb jokes to ruin the drama. Just storytelling.&&Yea its the same with ""Sing"" they only have like one model for any animal species that isn't one of the central character species&&Incredibles did that too, but that was about 10 years ago so I can overlook it&&Yeah, no way is John Cena able to command RDJ amounts.&&Some legit voice actors can command decent money. That said, he wouldn't really be paid for a level of performance that would be expected of a true VA, but more to smack his name on it. I just hope he has done decently and does take me out of the story when my kid and I go see it. &&>	weird voice takes

So basically a typical Peanuts cartoon then. 

I kid, Peanuts is my most favorite of IP, even more than Star Wars or Star Trek or Marvel or Disney.  That being said, the voice acting has always been quirky and somewhat clunky. That was the reason its endearing though, as I believe it was the first cartoon featuring children to be voiced by actual children. 

I’m glad the new one has the same feel while being overall “better”. 

&&For real. How many people take their kids to two movies the weekend before Christmas? You know the first choice for all but the toddlers is Star Wars. &&I doubt it.  Coco was not far behind Ferdinand so that remains to be direct competition.  Star Wars is obviously a huge draw with kids so most families are seeing that for the next month.  Jumanji opens on Wednesday so that will take most of the customers who don't want to deal with Star Wars crowds.  Then you have Pitch Perfect opening Friday which will be a big hit with female audiences. 

I'm not suggesting Ferdinand will be a financial disaster,  but it really needed to have a stronger opening for it to go on to success. &&[deleted]&&Yeah it is now&&Electric Boogaloo&&Man the pee I released after getting home from the theater was one of the most blissful feelings I have ever experienced lol &&I had to pee so much that by the end my piss had *become one with the force*, felt like I could hold it in forever.&&Welp, you're not the only one. &&Cut every scene with Finn and Rose, and the movie works just the same, and would have made me like it a lot more.&&Lolll this has been hilariously overlooked.  

Also, how did rose knock finn's ship over when he was on a straight line to that gun and she woukd have forced to swing out wide to the right? &&A tragedy, for sure. The most aggravating part of it being that they even seemed to know that the right direction was the one Nolan had pointed them in, of DC's darker and harder side of morality in neo-noir/postwar storytelling; Bruce Wayne watching in horror as people he cares for in his company die to collateral damage in Superman's fight with a villain, the abandonist fatalism of the Suicide Squad trailer. And then it's just ""Oh, you guys knew what you should have done... but said fuck it? Comic book movies just make money magically, screw the effort/talent/time/money to make a great movie? What?""&&I think you hit the nail on the head there. It seems like they tried to rush a team up movie, possibly to keep up with Marvel, but it probably would have benefited them to take their time, maybe do other solo movies first (The Flash? Aquaman?) It didn't feel to me like there was any build up, it was just ""hey have a Justice League movie""&&Or even just 20 more minutes with Aquaman in JL to flesh him out a bit.

I actually liked Justice League but I could just feel the better movie underneath the studio meddling.&&I don't think he's the only problem, or even the main problem, most likely. A lot of the humor in the DC movies feels shoehorned in, and ultimately it seems like its the studio producers wanting the movie to be more Marvel-y, because most of the marvel movies are funny. Unfortunately they're not very good at it, and DC characters just *aren't that funny.* That's not their lane. Batman was at his most successful when he was at his least funny. DC, for better or worse, has to take itself more seriously, and not try to copy Marvel's formula. Marvel characters are heroes out of the Iliad and the Odyssey. DC characters are the Gods. They embody and represent big, meaningful themes in idealized scenarios. Superman can be a boy scout, but he's interesting when he's asking the question 'Why should I help you?' Batman can be a cool gadget guy, but he's interesting when he asks 'What is justice?' Wonder Woman was a great movie because it asked where the evil in Men's hearts came from. Big, important themes are a space that Marvel can't occupy, but DC can. Its disappointing to see them giving up their theater the run in Marvel's lane. &&You'd think WB wold have learned after Sucker Punch and Guardians of Ga'hoole, but *noooo*&&Wonder Woman was a smash hit tho &&Wonder Woman did not in anyway contribute to how poor that film did. Sorry, but if anything it helped it do at least that “well”. &&I've been on a DC animated movie kick and it just blows my mind how much better they are than the recent live action ones, with the exception of Killing Joke and Teen Titans vs The Justic League. Like how can you consistently pump out some of the best stories dealing with these characters, and then misuse them sooo badly in live action.&&I nearly walked out of BvS twice, lol, and the only  reason I sat through SS was because a co-worker's brother worked on the VFX.&&Wonder Woman was the *only* good one on that list. And for that matter it was very good. I don't know why you'd say it's one of several reasons why it did poorly....

I haven't seen Justice League but apparently it tossed out a lot of what was good about WW too (including the costume design and art direction of the Amazons).

DC is on self-destruct mode, sadly.

I'd like to have seen Batflek get a serious shot at a good movie.&&Yeah, first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of Kun-Lun. &&Could be worse. I haven't seen Runaways yet but it's getting decent reviews, so I'm happy for that. Some of my other favorites (X-Statix, Nextwave, Superior Spider-Man) are almost certainly never getting MCU adaptations, but at least they're safe. &&[deleted]&&Yea I'd add to that that there's probably like a merchandising profit cut that goes to the actors or something like that, where if the franchise overall succeeds, the actors profit. &&I saw someone say when the trailer dropped that they hope the first one ends with Thanos getting the last stone then snapping his fingers and killing half the universe like in the comics. Then just cut to black and roll credits, super dark ending and very bleak. 

I think I'd like that assuming the build to that moment was handled well.&&I actually didn't believe my own eyes. The literal thought running through my mind was, ""Is that fucking MATT DAMON? WHAAAAAT?""

It's even funnier when you realize he often makes secret cameos in movies where his character dies.

&&Naughty Nurses 2 gets shit on so much, but it was honestly refreshing to see a film that didn't take itself too seriously. &&Well how the hell would you know, Gerald!??&&One of my favorites was from Nick Fury:

""Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on.""&&To avoid one Disney film from cannibalizing returns of another Disney film&&The circumstances that the last few star wars movies were pushed to December and Disney would want to space them out accordingly.&&I did the same thing, and it was so worth it. It made TLJ even better&&Plus all the other stuff coming out of Solo. Changing directors, reshoots, nobody wanted this in the first place. That kind of stuff&&Well if it wasn't for Finn and Rose the hacker wouldn't have told the FO about the cloaking sweep and the resistance would be mostly intact. Not inconsequential.&&[deleted]&&It just felt so weird.  It's like they rolled out of a moving car in the middle of a chase scene with the fate of the entire galaxy on the line and went to a casino and stopped to ponder questions about animal cruelty, war profiteering, and wealth disparity when they should have had a lot more urgency.&&Purple lady coulda just told him and avoided a ton of trouble&&It was in the movie because it failed. It’s the whole theme of the movie. Yoda even says that “the greatest teacher, failure is”. Every single character in this movie fails. People who think that it was pointless are failing (lol) at seeing the overarching theme. Poe fails, Luke failed Kylo, Rey failed at turning Kylo, Snoke failed at killing Rey, etc.&&I totally agree and I wish they had hit those thematic beats harder for Finn because that's not fully as obvious as it should be. And his suicide run at the end felt like manufactured suspense.&&> the purple haired commander lady

respect.  &&However note that many people think the character ""inconsistencies"" with Luke are less inconsistent, and more character development. Was my favourite part of the film personally &&I've seen the humor critique countless times which is interesting - I never even considered it because it didn't bother me a bit&&I'll often see people say ""well of course Star Wars fans hated it, they'll never be happy"", yet I'll also see ""well of course Star Wars fans loved it, they'll like anything Star Wars"".  There are too many variants to simply generalize the fanbase.&&i don't think you're weird. im a huge fan of stars, both trek and wars and the problem seems to be that these people arent 10 years old anymore. they demand the impossible: ""just make it exactly as magical as when I was a kid and put new stuff in too, but only new stuff that *I* agree with ""&&That was so corny it hurt. &&I enjoyed the animation for Kubo but the storytelling was rather lackluster. Coco did a much better job of integrating in cultural aspects as well as the music into the overall story. &&I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan, and while I love parts of the EU, I understand and actually like that the movies go in a different direction. Are there things I'd change about the ST? Sure, but there's things I'd change about the OT too.

I try and go in with an open mind, and so far I've really enjoyed the new movies. TFA was fun, TLJ was 2/3rds of an amazing movie. R1 is the SW movie I've always wanted since I was a kid.&&I avoided all talk and previews of the movie, and I disliked it. I think the real divide is between people who like Star Wars for the mythology and those who enjoy it regardless of the mythology. That *seems* to be the divide in our group between those who liked it and disliked it.

The weird part is that there really isn't any middle ground. &&And that's exactly why so many people don't like it. The hardcore fans have spent decades imagining what a sequel trilogy would be like, and now that it's not meeting their expectations they're disappointed.&&Gotta admit, in TFA, I thought Kylo Ren and Snoke were the most generic emperor/vader fill ins possible, like they were the Great Value of the Vader name brand.  Snoke was still shit this time, by Kylo Ren actually got some depth and it was a good performance.&&[deleted]&&Well, the kiss scene in the third act was really stupid and made me roll my eyes.&&100%. Never seen a movie that I hated and loved so passionately simultaneously.

So many scenes were ""FUCKING STAR WARS! WOOOOOOOOOOOO"" and SO many scenes were ""WHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYY..........""&&the elephants are literally all the same model scaled differently with some added textures&&That dang crocodile was in every frame!&&And this is why those movies cannot compete for Best Animated Feature ala Zootopia, Kubo and the Two Strings, Moana, etc.&&You're going to criticize Illumination for reusing assets and not mention god dang Minions?&&Does anybody know the typical budget of a pixar movie? Being typically the most carefully detailed and breath taking animations I've seen.&&The thing that's interesting to me about *The Incredibles*, is that while the movie looks extremely *dated*... it still looks quite *good*.

I mean, the models and textures are *immensely* more simplified than in more modern movies, and let's not even get into the various custom effects (lightmaps, fur/hair/foliage, etc, etc).  But the whole movie, every character and every scene and every background seems to have been carefully chosen to give us a cohesive, attractive whole, even when using 'old CGI' or whatever you want to call it.&&But the Incredibles is amazing.&&Yeah, the universal man! I think that was part of the DVD extras. Always thought it was cool. Modeling, rigging, and texturing a character is a LOT of work. &&I still remember the ""universal man"" segment from the Disney Channel&&Oh yeah his name would definitely be for name recognition but who honestly goes to see any movie because Cena is in it. He doesn’t command that real acting star power. Just my opinion though. This movie also isn’t some block buster cgi flick. I just can’t see him sucking up a ton of money &&I have a 6 and a 4 year old. Did I take my kids to ferdinand? Of course not, I got a babysitter and went to see star wars lol. &&You had to pee really bad but waited until you got home?&&Actual footage of /u/CRAZYC01E racing home: https://media.giphy.com/media/mIsyzR1FtGdb2/giphy.gif&&[Here's a pretty good article that shows where Marvel went right, and DC went wrong.](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/marvel-looks-back-at-iron-man-the-movie-that-started-it-all)

The essence of it was that they weren't trying to launch a cinematic universe, they were just trying to make a good Iron Man movie, and considerations about building on that came second, not first. Iron Man was a huge success and Robert Downey Jr. was suddenly massively popular. They had the foresight to tease us a little, but The Incredible Hulk was also a standalone movie, and the next ""MCU"" movie after that was Iron Man 2... a solid 2 years after the first Iron Man. We've all forgotten how sparse Marvel's offerings at the beginning used to be, as they made their movies carefully and tactfully, bringing it to a crescendo with The Avengers and then sprawling in all directions from there.

DC seems really desperate to skip that whole ""years of foundation-building"" part... or, heck, just ""years of good movies"" part. They tried to wire references and cameos in at every opportunity trying to artificially inflate their cinematic universe, while Marvel built theirs just by making a string of movies people actually wanted to see.&&It doesn't help either that now that theyfinally want to make a Flash movie, they want to make it about Flashpoint. You can't do a Flashpoint movie before building Central City and the Flash world enough for him resetting the world to actually matter. No emotional stakes...&&Thing is, DC heroes don't have to all be comedians for us to like them, just don't make them all gloomy and depressed. Batman, Martian Manhunter and Cyborg are more serious and dark, sure, but Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern and Green Arrow have absolutely no business being dark characters. Barry, Oliver and Hal can crack a few quips at each other, Diana and Clark can be confident and Arthur regal and noble. And stop filtering out all the colour of the shots. All of a sudden audiences don't have to take anti-depressants just to get through the film and I guarrantee that the movies would be infinitely better received&&And more importantly it had a coherent story that was watchable.&&Actually I sorta saw Wonder Woman as being the exception that proved the rule. Wonder Woman was great, and it had a different director and felt a very separate film. In my mind it somewhat solidified the idea that the other movies were bad and so we couldn't expect JL to be any good.

I do think SS was the big killer though, so much advertising budget, so much hype, amazing trailer, and people haaaaaated it.


If BvS killed the DC brand, SS killed the brand of marketing itself.&&A lot of the times people pulling the strings for live-action films are of a lot different mindset than those working in animation. Some of my teachers have worked in both film and animation and they say the culture is entirely different. 

One of my previous bosses worked at Pixar on Monsters University and she said the producers were a lot more hands-off than in film.

Anecdotal so take that as you will.&&Because they give them to people who don't understand them Snyder. Whereas animated movies are small scale thing, so they are given to (or based on works of) people who actually know hat this Superman thing is all about&&I nearly walked out too and I was on a fucking 767 over the Atlantic. &&>King of the Sandals and Fist Men&&Found the One True King of Westeros.&&Jesus Christ that'd be..controversial.&&Wait wait wait.

Makes sense. &&Yeah, I am immensely glad that I watched absolutely nothing Star Wars related for the last six months, except for TLJ itself. Having no clue at all about what to expect, I was very pleasantly surprised.&&I had forgotten about that when I wrote the original comment. Their whole subplot has very big consequences, which makes the complaints even weirder!&&And if it wasn't for Dr. Sadler repeatedly refusing to address her clearly panicking crew and reassure them that there was, in fact, a plan, Finn, Rose and the hacker wouldn't have been on the ship to get captured in the first place, because Po would have calmed the fuck down. I wouldn't say it was an inconsequential mission, no, but it damn sure was unnecessary.&&I agree with you, I thought their whole subplot was a slog to get through, but because it failed horribly, that's what made it worth it. It wasn't just another ""hey we have to do this really unlikely thing, oh shoot so many coincidences are happening for us to succeed, and we did it narrowly! nice!"". It also helped Poe's character quite a bit, since his plan failed, and he should have listened to his superior. &&[deleted]&&[Precisely, and he got to fight Phasma, and they also fucked up the transport escape by talking about it in front of the codebreaker, which, surprise surprise, was a key occurrence in moving the plot towards a final showdown between Kylo and Luke. Poe and Finn grew a ton out of the whole casino situation as shown by Poe turning away and saving his crew in those land speeders and Finn willing to sacrifice himself rather than run away. Watching it the second time really cleared up a lot for me.](#spoiler)

[There are so many nice parallels to the original trilogy. Snoke's death at the hands of Kylo vs. Palpatine and Vader, Luke's death vs. Obi Wan's (both died using a force they probably haven't used in decades against a former pupil to buy time so that the future of the Jedi could escape an almost inescapable situation), AT-AT land battle, rebels suffering heavy losses while on the run. I thought it did so much very well and I didn't feel any of the pacing issues.](#spoiler)

[My only real complaint is that I thought Rose's death saving Finn would be a real fitting way to close his story line in the film.](#spoiler)&&The whole movie was filled with tactical fuckups which I felt was the point of the whole movie, even if they didn't hit the thematic beats right in all instances.&&Totally true! I think sometimes we have these expectations that everything in a film needs to serve the plot directly, but this was more indirect. In fact, if I’m remembering right, it did greatly affect the plot because if they hadn’t done it the First Order wouldn’t have known to blow up the transport ships, right?&&I have mixed feelings on that scene. On the one hand, I completely agree with what you just said. Still, I also feel like it was kind of the culmination of his development throughout the film. At the beginning of the movie, he was about to desert the Resistance, and now we see him prepared to give his life for the cause &&Fucking people, its as if we each have our own opinions on things!

*Its time to stop*&&Wait. Are you trying to tell me all star wars fans don’t have a collective consciousness...I was certain they had some sort hive mind controlling them all.&&You’ve articulated what I was thinking for the longest. It’s really hard to recapture magical moments because everything that went into them, the time period, the mindset of the artists creating it, the mental disposition you had upon viewing the art for the first time... it’s all fleeting.  However, I do believe that you can have scenarios where you give the fans something different but familiar...that kind of bounces to the same beats but isn’t just a rehash. It’s difficult but not impossible.&&Totally agree, the story could have used some fine-tuning, the animation is absolutely incredible, seeing [the practical effects on the skeleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ZFlLAJ6QM) blew my mind.&&Those in the middle are not vocal, or don't give enough of a shit to comment.&&I love the expanded lore and mythology of it all, but all still loved it. You can't find a universal pattern here.&&He's really what Anakin should have been and he's a really brilliant character. If anything Rian Johnson really did well with developing Rey and Ren, I'm really intrigued to see how they do in the next movie (it's the rest of the movie and characters that I don't care about). &&Kylo Ren had plenty of depth in TFA--TLJ merely doubled down on it.

You should go back and rewatch TFA--your reaction to him may be far better than the first time.

I've been saying for two years that he absolutely stole the show in TFA. He was insanely polarizing because he seemed to be everyone's favorite or least favorite by a long shot. I'm really happy to see people shifting over to ""favorite"".&&I agree, which is why I tend to ignore audience scores. I check the metacritic score (RT doesn't tell me much), and if it looks polarised, I see what my 'favourite' reviewers think. 

I happen to feel the film was a 6 or 7 out of 10, but that's within a couple of points of what most critics thought, so that seems about right.

Audience scores tend to come from the most 'vocal'. The film (IMO) had some plot issues, I wasn't a fan of the editing and pacing, and I thought the humour was out of place at times, bit I don't know how you can give it a 'zero'. &&Best example: when leia was blown out of the ship I gasped. It was beautifully shot and was such a strong shock to me. Then.... I'M MARY POPPINS YALL!&&I noticed that when my kid watched it yesterday. While I enjoyed Sing for what it was, it was weird to look up and be startled seeing what I thought was a main elephant but it was a background character. They just looked so similar. &&I mean minions is the epitome of illuminations' laziness. Both in that minions is just an entire movie of copy pasted characters and that the movie doesnt even feel like it was wrote down at anypoint, and they jst made that shit up as they aninated it.&&Close to $200M these days.&&Nothing compared to the stampede in the lion king. That shit was tight.&&There was a lot of care and effort put into the movie, and Brad Bird, something Illumination doesn't have.&&Toy Story.

Toy Story looks pretty awful compared to modern CGI but it doesn't matter because of how they used it. The bright colors and plasticky textures work well because... Well, toys are bright and plastic. It's heavily stylized which works great.&&Might as well call it incredible&&The marketing piece that ran before Coco was like 20% about the actual movie and 80% JOHN CENA IS IN THIS.

He was on-screen for a large portion of the ad, so they're definitely trading on his popularity and image.

Whether that translates to a huge paycheck, I don't know. &&WWE has also been doing advertising for this movie in their programming. So Cena also carries with it some advertising in WWE's programming (who knows what the deal on that is, though).

But I suspect the kid that goes to a WWE event and ends up walking out in a ton of Cena merch would love the chance to see a movie with Cena in it.&&Some people just hate public restrooms.&&Oh yeah I saw that article a couple of weeks ago, really good read. I don't think anyone at Marvel really expected the level of success they've achieved, they just wanted to make a good movie. People also seem to forget that before Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr was still a recovering addict, and he wasn't exactly a moneymaker at that point in time. DC on the other hand seems to expect that if they put out any old superhero movie, people will flock to see it regardless of its quality. Really disappointing, as I do want both franchises to put out good movies.&&I really liked Nigel Thornberry as the God of War&&> And more importantly ~~it had a coherent story that was~~ **it focused entirely on Gal Gadot, who is infinitely** watchable

  FTFY&&DC has amazing characters, and WW proved they can have successful solo films.

I think they just felt they needed to catch up to Marvel in terms of Cinematic Universes. Except Marvel had 5 movies to build up to The Avengers where you got to see everyone team up, they didn't start with ""Iron Man VS Captain America"". Seeing conflict between the Avengers took THIRTEEN films to build into why it was so awesome.

I think they should have just left Batman on the side for a while. Flesh out your other characters in solo movies, and make references to Superman in Metropolis. Then when you've done Wonderwoman, Aquaman, The Flash, Cyborg, etc, THEN introduce Batman in the Justice League.

Everyone was still in love with the Christopher Nolan films. It was too soon.&&Yea, I don't see them doing it because of the outrage. Especially if there were no post credits scene, I don't doubt we will get to see Thanos kill shit tons of people but I bet it ends with like a Captain Marvel cameo or something to establish that everything isn't totally fucked yet.&&Damn, five years.&&r/usernamechecksout&&But how will people be able to watch TWO different movies in a six month span?&&I feel like those both appeal to different audiences though, Star Wars and Avengers largely cross over in terms of fans.&&There's also some parallelism between Finn/Rose [going off to find the legendary codebreaker and having to settle for what they find](#spoiler) and Rey [going off to find the legendary Jedi and having to settle for what she finds](#spoiler).

Thematically interesting, but the narrative execution could have been better.&&I think for me the main point to it was Poe's development. He got slapped down as the cocky pilot who can do and get away with anything as long as his plan ultimately succeeds, up to and including mutiny, and getting half the rebel fleet destroyed. Well his plan didn't succeed. He learned some humility and learned he needs to trust others. The story itself might not have led to much but the point was pretty strong IMO.&&Its a great change of pace from TFA where the main characters end up coincidentally bumping into eachother across planetary distances too many times&&>All this unfair criticism of the subplot makes me wonder if people just want to see the same stories acted out again and again instead of something fresh and different.

The movie is one giant critique of that mentality, so I guess it's no surprise that those fans feel insulted. &&I really agree. Also even though he is a main character and ""safe"" at least until the next movie, with the way this movie went, I wasn't actually certain that he would survive, which is quite an achievement I think. 

A lot of people are saying this movie tosses out a bunch of things that TFA set up, but I actually think Rian Johnson was very shrewd in using TFA as a jumpoff point, continuing the story in a way that feels like a genuine sequel, but also ended up being possibly the most self contained, stand-alone second chapter of a trilogy that I've ever seen. The lack of a big cliffhanger at the end was quite refreshing too. &&Also he has just inadvertently gotten most of the resistance killed because of his fuck up on the super star destroyer. Probably feeling a bit guilty about that. Might explain why he was willing to sacrifice himself. &&Yeah, there's always a need to start putting people in buckets over this thing. I've seen some particularly vocal Star Wars fans on Twitter going insane over people who like TLJ. Saying that the critics who like it are Disney shills and fans who liked it are not true SW fans.

I'm a huge SW fan, with a resume that stretches back to Heir to the Empire in terms of engaging with the universe. I loved TLJ. I can see why people might dislike it, but I think people are way over correcting with their criticism. &&Honestly, I hate to say it, but she should have died there.&&Although, to be fair to the creators, all real-life elephants look identical to me as well.&&*Sing* was mediocre, but I'd be up for a spin-off about the English gangster gorillas.&&Listen if it works, run with it lol&&But even their ""bombs"" come out 1.5-2x budget. They don't over-saturate, the animation is top quality, I don't know if maybe a couple weaker stories were the problem or if they opened against strong competitors, but they continue to make money. &&Roll credits&&I credit the director Patty Jenkins. As Ebert was fond of saying, actors can't save a movie without an effective storyteller.&&>

Seeing conflict between the Avengers took THIRTEEN films to build into why it was so awesome.

I think part of the problem is that DC had to rush for the exciting team-up movies because the standalone films weren't doing as well.

Marvel's early movies had a distinct advantage in that they were generally well liked by critics and fans alike. DC has had mixed results.&&Yeah I need a gap of at least 8 months between watching movies&&Going to must see Disney movies is going to turn into weekend long getaways.&&And therefore basically a critique of the movie that directly preceded it, which is actually kind of impressive for a movie of this size.&&Yep and that is why I loved it, it took the movie in my head and smashed it to pieces and gave me something new and unexpected, I loved the answers it gave and the ones it didn't.&&I thought she would and I don't understand why she didn't. What purpose did she serve other than that? She spent most of the movie in a coma. &&Crediting Patty Jenkins seems correct.

Man of Steel, Batman vsSuperman, and Justice League were all directed by Zack Snyder and they all sucked.

It's unclear to me how the guy still has a job.&&There's also fans like me that did not watch a single Star Wars video prior to watching TLJ. The Marvel movies pull the majority of its content from the comics so there's not as much fear of big spoilers on the trailers.&&I've been thinking about that aspect a lot since I saw TLJ on Saturday, especially with Abrams now coming back for IX. I can see a ""Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis"" type structure, but I wonder if that was the plan all along. &&I think my brother put it well. He said ""Everything in that movie was designed to make you say 'They wouldn't do that in a Star Wars movie!'""&&Just from a production standpoint, I'm pretty sure the intention was to feature Han a bit more in Episode 7, Luke in Episode 8, and Leia in Episode 9. Leia was kept alive so she could be featured in the next one. Obviously, that really isn't possible anymore, but I'm guessing Disney still wanted to stick to the original script for this one, and just make the changes to Episode 9.&&",2017-12-18 10:42:59
Documentary 'Icarus' Returning to Theaters Following Russia Olympics Ban,32355,7l9lu3,http://variety.com/2017/film/news/icarus-russia-doping-theaters-1202642255/,897,1513864721.0,,"I've recommended this documentary to so many people. It feels like you're watching an insanely impossible story about espionage and secret practices, but it's real. &&I'd still kinda like to see the documentary that this started out to be. The end result was serendipitous, and good, but still...
&&This documentary made me so mad and I don't even care about sports.&&I enjoyed this documentary a lot, would highly recommend.&&Must watch! It’s an absolutely insane documentary! &&If you enjoyed this documentary, I recommend listening to the Joe Rogan podcast with Bryan Fogel (episode 1019). It goes into some further detail on the doping practices and how he met Grigory Rodchenko. &&As a former athlete who was among those circles for a short time:

*""Everybody knew""* was the mood.

There are countries that *everyone* looks at askance, automatically. Russia is basically the top of that list in large part due to suspicious domestic performances in so-so fields from athletes who never compete on the international circuit, and are only seen at major championships.

Athletes training in places where international testers are just flat out not allowed to visit, that kind of thing. Athletes who never leave Russia, are never subject to testing at European competitions. The rash of DQ's *prior* to Beijing, from athletes whose IAAF tests turned up different DNA from their Russian tests? That was the tip of the iceberg.

These weren't  just ""suspicious performances and sour grapes"". These were suspicious patterns and behaviours that lent an air of illegitimacy to their performances and ""clean"" status.

Hell, folks cry about the Jamaicans... but the Jamaicans at least are  on the circuits *constantly*, trying to make a living, and subject to testing there.

Cheaters among them? Sure. People freelance their cheating all the time. 

USADA even doesn't have clean hands, but there's not even a proper structure of National funding. A lot of filth has actually been laid at the feet of Nike and other sponsors wanting to boost their squads....

But Russia is at the level of the East Germans... and higher, as it seems Russia conspired *directly with Lamine Diack*.

Direct corruption running to the top of not only their country, but reaching out to the international governing body as well? Fun stuff.

None of it is invented. None of it is fake news. It's been going on a long time, and *yes* they do care that much about just winning medals.&&I'm not a sports guy, but this seemed more like a scripted movie than a documentary. There was a lot of tension and drama. The documentary started off as one thing and part way through it morphs into something else much bigger.

Really great watch.&&I watched this documentary and it is eye opening and enlightening to say the least. It is extreme state sponsored cheating. Imagine the FBI helping athletes cheat to win in the Olympics because that is what is happening in Russia with the FSB and Russian athletes.

The thing that really struck me is that if they are willing to go to these lengths just to win some medals at the Olympics, then imagine the lengths they are willing to go to for other more important geopolitical reasons, like rigging an election.&&Wow, I watched it yesterday. Was bored and decided to watch a documentary, found a recommendation on reddit and then watched it on netflix. 

2 hours just flew by and had my heart pumping at the end of it. Feels like you are watching a fictional movie, but you have to remind yourself that this just happend months ago. 

[I both hated and loved Grigory Rodchenkov at the same time. A pure mad scientist](#spoiler)
&&*entire crew found dead in a ditch*&&That moment when you are like 3 quarters into the movie and you remember that you started watching a film about some random cyclist who wanted to try getting juiced up to win a race ! :)&&Breathtaking documentary and so important to watch, especially in light of the current geopolitical tensions. And not just for people interested in the Olympics, cycling or sports in general - it illustrates beautifully how the urge to win and stay on top at any cost has led to the disintegration of all moral considerations.
On that note: I just read that the two finalists of the German Masters (Darts) both tested positive for illegal substances. (Source in German: http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/doping-im-darts-double-out-beim-german-masters-a-1184473.html ) I didn't even know that was a thing - doping in darts?&&I watched this on a plane.  It's captivating at times, though it's a stark contrast between the first half when he thought he was making a blood doping documentary, and the second half when he ended up in a near real world spy thriller.

Seemed like it worked out for him though, because his blood doping plan failed to net any significant results in his bike racing which would have tanked his original documentary.&&Just watched this yesterday. 
Holy shit, it just got better and better with each passing minute. 
Truly a great documentary! &&Careful Icarus.&&A question I had after watching that documentary was how nobody's asking how the likes of Great Britain (in particular) beat a state-sponsored doping Russia at the 2012 Olympics when they hadn't managed it for decades before. I would love for this sort of question to have been touched on more, as it seems like the natural thing to ask.

It was interesting hearing Don Catlin (one of the pioneers of anti-doping) basically say the tests mean sweet fuck all. We've [heard that before from convicted dealers](https://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/index.php?threads/probably-the-best-ped-insights-you-will-ever-see-in-this-interview.412846/), but with Catlin saying it, and Justin Gatlin's coach being caught offering 'undetectable drugs' to take ""[just like every other sprinter in America](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/42409433)"", it seems pretty obvious that this problem goes well beyond the Russians.

&&The turn the movie took was good, but I'd still like to see a movie dedicated entirely to seeing how high up the ladder someone can climb when juiced to the gills.&&EVERYONE IS ON DOPE!!!!!!....EVERYONE.  

I would recommend watching the ESPN 30for30 on Ben Johnson.  

It ends with Dr Don Catlin (same American Doctor from Icarus)

He took 2000 samples from the 1984 Games, and re-tested them in 2000s.  The results disturbed him. &&After you watch the movie listen to the podcast he does with Joe Rogan it's really enlightening.&&Also been recommending this like crazy. Only movie I saw at Sundance last year and so happy I did. What a crazy story shift.&&Please let Russia be banned from the 2018 World Cup.&&Careful Icarus &&I'm hoping to win a few Krusty burgers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVQkOc73uJA&&That documentary was dope&&Just watched it on Netflix! Recommend. &&Amazing doc.  Watch it.&&Joe Rogan just did a podcast where he interviews the director and they go though tons of details that wasn’t in the movie. &&funny thing is that it's not only russia or even china...

it's the whole system: the IOC (international olympic committee) 

they claim they want to build a better world through sport but infact are accepting and maybe even encouraging doping.
it's all a big deceit.
the focus should be on the institutions that run this flawed game.

plus it's not only the olympics but every other sport aswell: football, tennis, MMA and so on...&&Russia should be banned from the Olympics until an independent commission has decided there is some chance their state sponsored cheating is forever done.

So, maybe a long, long time. Also they need to take away way more medals, going back decades.&&This [Article](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=3&hl=cs&ie=UTF8&nv=1&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=de&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://m.spiegel.de/spiegel/a-571031.html&usg=ALkJrhgpwDS9oNpRa9wLGf4haQmNCHBX-w) of one of the biggest performance enhancing drug providers to elite athletes is an easy read and very informative.

Don't go pay to see this in theaters if so.&&Watched this, so good. Also insane story.&&Biggest plot turn in a movie I've seen in the last year. &&When they were talking about placing untainted urine through holes in walls in special places without cam coverage....I was like “damn! This sounds like some BS Mission Impossible script”. &&That movie took me for a wild ride.&&I've never heard of this and now I want to see it. &&Reading this thread, I'm soooooo glad that so many people saw that movie&&Very good documentary, highly recommended.&&Oh, im disappointed.
I thought iCarly was back.&&Maybe they should release a documentary about Lance Armstrong, don't see too many of those in cinemas.&&Just shows you how far Russia will go. This is just sports, and you think they wouldn’t do more to mess with politics? You got to
Be kidding&&One of the best things I've ever watched. &&I heard about this on Joe Rogan's podcast. It really fascinated me, i'm going to sit down and watch it on Netflix over the Xmas break.  &&Great documentary , I still wonder why the head of the russian doping agency did this.
I can only think that either he grew a conscience or someone   close to him had a problem.
&&This story is better than any spy novel&&Wow glad to see this doc doing so well, it had a lot of buzz at the film festival where I saw it but I had not heard much about it otherwise.&&Talk about one helluva rabbit hole.&&If you want to know more about the documentary, Joe Rogan did a podcast with the guy behind it. It's fascinating and really illuminates just how deep this doping stuff goes. The idea that *no* *one* is clean.&&I read this as Icarly&&Am I the only one who wants an Olympics where drugs are allowed, just to see how crazy we could get.&&Just watched this last night out of the blue. BRILLIANT filmmaking and the skill of storytelling is phenomenal. Will make you question ""why didnt I hear more about this, this is HUGE!!!""&&This is my favorite movie of the year.  Incredible filmmaking.  Crazy story.  Do not miss it!
&&Great film.&&I did not enjoy the doc maker in this or the general editing choices. The subject is fascinating though. &&I watched it for the first time last week. Unbelievable how this happened for all these years and WADA had no clue. &&After you watch the movie listen to the podcast he does with Joe Rogan it's really enlightening.

&&This documentary makes the 1980 Olympic hockey team all the more a miracle. Bunch of kids from Minnesota and Boston beat the best team in the world, which was massively doped up &&So what was the point of cheating? They still got their asses kicked and could barely beat the dutch and they don't even have any of their own mountains.

I guess they put all their effort into troll farms and Trump support.&&“Returning to theaters” in this case means playing in a closet in Brooklyn.&&I put a link on my facebook to this doc the moment after I watched it. Probably the most riveting documentary I’ve ever seen. I mentioned in my facebook post that watch this movie and then tell me that Russia wouldn’t go through the trouble of trying to rig an election for a candidate that would lift sanctions on their country. 

Got crickets of course. &&this documentary is eye opening to the systematic attempts by Russia to become number 1 in every arena.  Putin is a megalomaniac who needs to be stopped.&&this doc was sweet, but i cant help but feel like they could have dispensed with the whole, i wanna be like lance thing at the beginning. i get it sets him on this path, but it just kinda seemed like a typical Boulderite with too much time and money on his hands wanting to be the fastest cyclist around. the doc eventually left that storyline entirely behind, yet we still get to watch him race two races doped up. &&This story is deep..... and sad &&Everybodies on steroids &&this was a great documentary but it is a heavy propaganda against russian while every country’s team is using steroids&&Still salty that the trailer song hasn't been released yet.&&Relevant old SNL skit

https://www.hulu.com/watch/4090&&I just watched it last night in Netflix. I'd recommend it.&&Amazing documentary!!!!&&I couldn't leave my wife and family behind. Especially if I feared for their safety. I'd stay with them.

Of course I wouldn't run an entire countries drug cheat program either, but that part of the docu never really made sense.

Otherwise enjoyable and well made. Not surprising in the least. I'm naturally skeptical anyway about this subject.&&I thought the most fascinating part of this documentary was that he went through this full doping program trying to improve his performance in an endurance race and wound up doing worse than when he was clean. Granted, he's not an elite level athlete...but it kind of made the whole doping thing seem pointless. To add to it all the trickery and bribery and danger these athletes and coaches put themselves through, there doesn't seem to be an advantage. &&Thought we were finally getting the Icculus documentary. &&I thought Netflix doesn't do theatres.&&This doc is intriguing and very appropriate to the times, but I really didn't think it was all that well done. I think its content is overshadowed by its filmmaking.&&I’ve watched this, can anyone explain the whole beginning to me?  What was his purpose in doping the bike race, was the movie made only after he met the Russian ring leader?&&Did Russia ever release a response to the ban? I Goggled it but can't find anything with reports earlier this month saying they were expecting a response, but I have not seen any reports since suggesting so. &&I just happened to watch this 2 days ago. What a ride. It's like I kept thinking , is this really happening , as I watched it. It's more like a crazy spy plot than youd imagine.  Brian fogel kind of stumbled into a jackpot of a story over what he was intending to film, although the theme he was going for would also have been interesting.&&Did anyone ever figure out what song plays in the original trailer? It was an awesome cover of ""The Distance"" by Cake.
&&I didn't care much for this scandal and don't watch any sports, but I found myself watching this one day whilst trolling Netflix, and ended up discussing it with a semi-pro cyclist I know at work for half an hour the next day! This is literally 'the' most intense documentary ever made! &&Professor McLaren had a bunch of researchers and writers at my school, and i was (and still am) good friends with one of them, who I watched Icarus with, which made me like one step removed from one of the people in the flick which was pretty cool.

It's one of the rare movies (like Weiner) that changes course dramatically and becomes an almost different movie midway through. &&Same here, really interesting how he starts on a plot line and accidentally discovers the m.o. of a foreign country that in turn develops into a global scandal. &&It was a great film. It really gave me a new perspective on the whole ordeal&&I don’t normally plug Joe Rogan but he did a 3 hour chat with Bryan Fogel the director of Icarus. It adds a lot to the documentary. Check it out [JRE #1019](http://youtu.be/P2FCBIpKCdI)&&It’s fantastic. The second half feels like a claustophobic thriller. &&I watched this literally yesterday.  Couldn't stop talking about it to my wife.  Not sure I conveyed how awesome it was or she's just not interested.&&You should also check out Tickled. It starts similar, just a journalist looking into competitive tickle fighting and ends up being a scary ride involving mafia like groups and very real threats. &&This movie goes from 0-100 real fucking quick. I always describe it as a documentary that starts out about PEDs in cycling then turns completely into something else. Seriously unbelievable.&&Plus there are dogs.&&[deleted]&&I was looking forward to the simple but interesting cycling doc... had to buckle in!&&I watched a documentary a while ago on Netflix about an amateur cyclist who went into doping to prove how easily it was to do and to see what the effects were. 

Then when I was looking on Netflix last week this came up as a new addition. It looks like it has the same amateur cyclist in and also the same doctor who was helping him dope but the description mentioned about the Russian Olympic team and I can’t remember any of that from the first documentary I had watched. 

Are there two documentaries with the same person involved in similar themes or am I just being a complete moron and can’t remember the Olympic stuff from the first time I watched it?&&The transition from  
""Okay :) :) that sure is an interesting story Mr Russian Guy""  :secretly does the he's crazy gesture:  
to 

""Jesus fuck... he's completely telling the truth and...  it's actually... *way* worse. ""

was what impressed me most. 

I'm not sure if it was intended to be like that, but I was pretty fucking skeptical about all of Grigory's promises and stories at the start.&&I just watched it for the first time and was blown away. Totally agree. &&Same. It’s one of the best movies I’ve seen. Top 10 films for me. Just a compelling documentary. &&The part that I don't understand is why Gregory would help him in the first place knowing he's being video taped, and then act surprised when he is ousted. It doesn't make any sense.&&i just find it amusing that people seem to think its just certain nations doing this, i can guarantee you every single major state is doing something, either state sponsored or not its happening on such a large scale they might as well just make using performance enchaining drugs legal in the Olympics and be done with it.&&After this movie and the director, Brian Fogel's appearance on Joe Rogan Experience I no longer believe any athlete I see on TV is clean.  

It's not the focus of this documentary but Grigory is unbelievably smart when it comes to his field of expertise.  on the podcast Fogel would explain the new ways of disguising PEDs that Grigory engineered.  &&Fella sucks at cycling, decides to roid under the guise of documentary, meets a scumbag mastermind behind the implementation of russian doping program(who was doping himself and others decades before Putin even came into power), tries to portray him as the ""victim"", if not outright as the protagonist of the movie, because he is supposedly a likeable fella. All i got from this ""documentary"" is that Bryan Fogel is an unpleasant man who doesnt even try to remain unbiased. &&Is it on Netflix? &&It's such a good movie. It starts off in one direction (which is still interesting) then takes a hard right turn into insanity. Such a good watch.&&It's a very well done documentary.  I started it off as a casual slouched over high as fuck sunday time waster.  By the end I was dying to know how my buddy Gregoriy was doing.&&That's because of the sensationalized editing. They did a good job blending Hollywood type cinematography into a documentary &&Did not think it was going to be as hot as it was. It felt more like a spy movie. &&Expln&&I just watched it after reading about it here. 

Wow. Why did I never see this? This is so good. &&You should check out the book, “Red Notice” by Bill Browder. &&I listened to a podcast with Brian (the creator). He said that the most difficult part was deciding what story to tell. He said they have hundreds of hours of footage that they left on the editing floor. I'd love to see some kind of directors cut or bonus footage &&Well we did get it in a way. It seems like it would have been a pretty shitty conclusion. He was hoping he would place better in that race while he was doping but he didn't. So his big pay off for the doc failed. He still could have shown how easy it would be to get away with doping and how testing would show him clean but i think he was very upset hat he placed lower in that race because he knew it made his documentary not work.&&It ended up not even being about sports. Great doc. &&Same here. I also loved how the documentary started out for one reason and completely evolved into something entirely bigger. Fantastic documentary. &&Haven't watched it but why? &&Where to watch? &&Since you used the word insane I'm now gonna watch it.&&Where can I watch it&&Will do. Is it 3 or 4 hours long? ;-)&&[Joe Rogan Experience #1019 - Bryan Fogel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCBIpKCdI)&&""Jamie pull up that video of the moose getting hit by a truck.""&&[deleted]&&Rich Roll podcast as well very succinct &&RemindMe! 6 hours&&The part that struck me most about the podcast was the description of the sacrificial lambs that Rodchenko had to give up. Because if there were no positive tests, that would be suspect, so the ministry would make the decision that certain people would no longer be supported by the program.  Then the ministry told Grigory and all of the sudden, the athletes in question were testing positive and then banned from competition / training.  These were frequently people that Grigory had known for years that essentially had the carpet pulled out from under them.  &&Wait, Fogel from Superbad is involved in this??! Dayuumm..&&Done.&&Bryan Fogel would not shut up in that episode.&&He did another podcast with Victor Conte five or so years ago which called out almost everything that happened in Icarus. Check it out if you're interested.&&This wasn't insinuated in the documentary, but one of my biggest takeaways is that the US must just be better at hiding doping.

There was all the stuff with Lance and the other US bikers and then the American doctor knew exactly the guy to send him to when he wimped out of administering the doping regimen. &&> Russia is at the level of the East Germans

[For reference: East German women's track athlete.](http://tfs.ucoz.com/2011-Images/Athletes-pix/Legends/Marita_Koch.jpg)&&This is why they need to go all in and make doping totally legal, even encouraged.  Would be interesting to see what kind of monsters each nation trots out to compete. &&Such a good point about how the athletes never leave Russia or go to any events where the testers can go. &&My go to for showing how effective steroids and other PED's are is East Germany. People don't realize it, but the are *still* in the top 10 most gold medals and total medals all time in summer olympics history.

East Germany. A country with only 17 million people, competed in only five summer Olympics and had such poor living conditions that people regularly died or were killed trying to escape. It's just not anything close to a fair playing field for those that don't want to do that to themselves.&&On the same note, it's important to remember that documentaries are primarily made for this purpose, i.e., to entertain. This can lead to some liberties being taken while filming/ constructing the story. In this case, I'm guessing the filmmaker knew about Grigory's situation beforehand and started building the story from there. It doesn't really affect the underlying issue in this scenario, but it's always good to keep a skeptical mind when watching a doc. &&Yeah I just commented the exact same thing.

So if Russia is willing to go through that incredibly complex system of cheating just for sports, don’t you think they would try to rig an election for a candidate that would lift sanctions on their country? Not even a little bit?

Posted that on facebook and got crickets of course. &&What I'm about to say is just a tin foil hat theory:

Maybe they are building super soldiers and using the Olympics as a testing ground&&One thing not acknowledged at all about this documentary is how at first it was the US anti doping head that was going to help him beat the tests. Definitely raised suspicions that Russia is not alone
&&You mean to tell me that they would probably go to great lengths to sabotage the presidential election of the leader of the free world and put someone in power who would most likely make questionable decisions that could potentially destabilize the current power structure of the world??? /s&&Simultaneous heart attacks, comrade. &&In competitive shooting and archery they dope with things like beta blockers. Beta blockers reduce the physical effects of stress like shakiness/tremors, fast heart rate, high blood pressure etc. They are also sometimes used by musicians for stage fright and even surgeons to steady the hands. I would guess that might be what they were doping with.&&I agree with you. If they are willing to go to these extremes to win some medals at the Olympics, then think of what they are willing to do politically, like rigging elections.&&I dunno what they tested positive for but something adderall can greatly improve concentration which is considered a performance enhancing drug. For example if I play league of legends or even pool on adderall I'm a much better player because I'm much more focused so I could see these guys using something like this in darts to improve performance  &&Careful Icarus, with your wax wings and your Van Dyke beard!&&Reddit always delivers.&&Great Britain? Surely not by sending jiffy bags filled with ""medicine"" via Publicly funded employees to a cyclist the week of a race? Oh and then losing the records just in time for an investigation that then cleared them anyway. 

Or also a country that had their highest medal total ever in their home Olympics especially in events that specifically benefit strength and power performance (swimming/rowing/cycling).

I won't even get into the sports personality of the year and his coach who has very bad links to peds&&Almost every athlete competing in the olympics is doping. They train so much they have to dope or else they fall behind due to injury or recovery down time. &&The alleged prevalence of doping in the cycling space (based on say: Lance Armstrong’s testimony) would mean that you would perhaps not be able to get very far, because a significant part of the other competitors would also be using doping.

I would assume that when at others are using it too, it comes down to potential, talent and skill, so it’s likely that someone wouldn’t just dominate because they doped.&&The difference is of course WADA made this program specifically designed to catch people by having separate containers for the same specimen so that even if one is cheated, you can go back to the other one and double check.

Then Russia used state paid FSB agents to steal and replace those backup specimens (with the help of the head WADA tester, the guy in witness protection in the US now) so that when their athletes who won medals were re-tested after having already faked the original tests, that their urine would come back clean.

The FSB (Russian Government) literally bought a building next to the games that they converted into a urine storage facility and would have agents transport the 'clean' urines from the athletes across the street to the lab where they used a false power outlet to pass and replace the dirty urines with clean urines WHILE THE SOCHI GAMES WAS HAPPENING.

""Everyone cheats"" narrative isn't even remotely at this level.&& They're hosting, so that's not happening. &&Lol FIFA is way worse than the Olympic committee.  If they aren't moving the Qatar World Cup in 2022, where migrants ""workers"" are being used as slave labor to construct the stadiums, Russian doping isn't even crossing their minds.

Edit:aren't&&I am from russia and i agree&&I scrolled all the way down just to find this. Well done sir&&It’s a stew. &&Go and listen to the JRE episode as well. &&Source? &&Ban then until putin is no longer dictator.&&You should look harder. There are plenty of documentaries on lance.&&Straight from Sundance to Netflix will do that.&&Russia did dramatically better in that Olympics, than in the previous one... the cheating paid off big-time for them, until it was caught. They went from winning 3 gold medals in [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics_medal_table), to 13 gold medals in [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics_medal_table). (Four of those gold medals have now been taken away due to cheating, though.)&&But her emails!&&I loved that part. He has an idea and the documentary starts and after 45 minutes or so the whole thing gets blown up and here we are. 

&&I'm halfway through it and don't understand why this man has been so co-operative and ready to talk to the narrator on recorded video.&&> Of course I wouldn't run an entire countries drug cheat program either, but that part of the docu never really made sense.

Doesn't it? The guy is a pawn. He had no real choice. He got directed to cheat and in Russia you do it or you're replaced.

Seems like eventually the weight of the guilt overwhelmed him much like some serial killers who decide to confess. Seemed like just the act of telling someone else about all the shit he had done helped to vindicate him to himself.&&The point of that was to show you have to dope in order to compete and to show how easy it was to get away with it. 
&&Not much of a response apart from total denial. 
&&that shocked me. When someone recommended it to me I was told it was about doping and how not to get caught, no idea about anything with russia. The it popped up in the movie and I was dumbfounded, it was a total accident.&&In a similar vein (but completely different subject matter), the documentary Tickled on HBO sucked me in. I started watching late one night intending to fall asleep to it and never finish watching. It took a complete left turn and became increasingly bizarre. I couldn't stop watching and ended up taking in the whole documentary that night.&&[deleted]&&Like a sweater, you pull the wrong thread and all of it just unravels.  I was engrossed and stunned at just how complicated and commited the cheating was..&&And we see Russia essentially assasinate anyone with knowledge of the program.&&This shit is so good! Go watch now! The director was also interview by joe rogan recently, worth the watch/listen.&&Is it like 'capturing the Friedman's' where he starts off a documentary about New York's last clown then it turns into the debacle of his dad being a child molester and his brother assisting him?  &&SEMI SPOILER (but it is real life so.. ) Same here, the almost throwaway comment by Girgory about Putin's approval ratings dropping, athlete doping, swapping samples, subsequent ratings rise, and then Ukraine invasion made a ton of sense. He said he felt guilty and that even seemed like the catalyst, yet it was maybe mentioned for 5 min max. Plus all those construction contracts... 

Side note, gotta watch those Wiki edits for Grigory and doping in general. Noticed that some stuff was getting deleted right after I watched the documentary. &&Yeah this is an excellent chat. 

Look into it. That's all I'm saying&&I almost pulled my dick over that podcast! &&Joe Rogan isn't the most interesting podcaster but he has some of the most consistently interesting guests.&&Thanks.  Just saw this doc.  Can't way to listen to this.&&Maybe she's on the juice and you're too close to finding out.&&Yeah, it's something you have to ""make"" people watch, because describing it doesn't convey the peril and tension you feel watching it.  I had the same experience telling people about it.&&She needs to see this. &&Tickled was SOOOOOOOO unsettling. Guh. Shivers. &&[deleted]&&That's what Russia is willing to do just to win some games. Imagine what they're willing to do when it comes to international politics. &&[deleted]&&of COURSE all the big countries have tons of doping.  As the documentary points out, the doctors know when the athletes need to finish their regimen in order to see the most gains but still test clean at the event.  The only difference for the Sochi Olympics was Russia said ""OK guys, we gotta win all of these so don't worry about stopping your drug regimen, we'll make sure it's not a problem.""  It's impossible to keep athletics clean, no matter what regulations and testing are put in place.  People will always figure out the optimal way to work around the system.  &&Perhaps but the comparison could also be like comparing a stealth bomber to a Hyundai.  State sponsorship and leveraging of their intelligence resources and home soil advantage.  Compare that to what is going on on the street level that athletes do themselves.  What Russia did was allow them to go balls out on steroids during the games with no taper or smaller dosages.  Also, I would think if America were to pull something like this we would actually feel some sense of shame/remorse.  While the Russian response has been the now very typical ""we completely deny this, this is all made up.""  It's like if your wife comes in and finds you in bed with another woman and your response is ""what woman?"".  This is an important difference between US and Russia.  &&Doping is rampant in athletics. There’s a great 30 for 30 documentary covering Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis in the 1984 Olympics. It was widely rumored the USOC covered up Carl Lewis’ positive test results. But it’s a far stretch to compare an Olympic committee to receiving direct orders from the president.&&It's definitely there in football/(Soccer For NA) &&There have been dozens of PED busts over the years, many in cycling, for instance.  

Look at athletes from 100 years ago compared to today.  What?  Today they just ""work harder""?  Sprinters didn't start looking like body builders until the '70s.  

&&Do athletes dope? Yes of course they do there are plenty f examples throughout the history of sport. But are there many more examples of state sponsored doping at the scale and level of sophistication that took place at Sochi, unlikely.&&Icarus showed it's not about the olymics and doping, it's about Russia pouring money into doing whatever it takes to retain approval ratings.

doping, bribery, murder.

Then they get a slap on the wrist about it so they can carry on doing it.&&Anythign that isn't illegal to take is being taken by the boatload by any athlete who wants to get to the next level.  When  Iplayed HS FB in the late 1990's, three guys on my team did multiple cycles of roids, and offered me to get in on it with them (I was a scrub).

I politely declined, but kept my mouth shut.&&This documentary came out months ago. You are a moron and are talking about the same documentary&&I remember watching this a while ago, could be the one. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05zhqvk
&&Yup&&Why don’t movie editors ever tidy their floors? I’m forever reading about clipping left on the floor&&He placed lower because of having issues with his bicycle not because he was performing worse. &&One of my takeaways was ""What goof rides in a race without charging his Di2 gear?""
 &&well like gregory said that was entry level stuff. The plan was for him to live in russia and do even more hard core doping and race again&&[It says in this interview](http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/icarus-bryan-fogel-russia-doping-scandal-olympics-netflix.html) that he would have finished 12th or 13th without the problem with his bike, but the bike issues cost him an hour. So he would have improved only SLIGHTLY from the previous year in terms of actual placement (he finished 14th the year before). 

With that said he did say at the beginning of the movie that there was a huge performance gap between him and the top 10 or so riders, so even with doping its quite possible he just couldn't bridge that gap. He is 40 years old now, I'm sure even if he drugs himself to the gills he isn't going to compete with world class 20 year olds who might even be on drugs themselves. 

He also says in the interview that the year before, he was completely destroyed by the race and took a month to recover, but on drugs, he was pretty much ready to go right away again.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&State-sponsored cheating is such a brazen fuck-you to every other country. It goes all the way to the top and was approved by if not ordered by Putin himself. Every single Russian athlete in the Olympics was on performance enhancing drugs. And even with a mountain of evidence against them, they basically just flat out deny anything happened. Russia's (Putin's) solution is to have the people a few levels below killed. It's maddening.

I don't want to spoil it too much, but the documentary ends with the central person being put into the US's witness protection program to prevent him from being killed by Russian operatives.

Watch the doc, it's seriously good.&&Basically if Putin was willing to go to such insane lengths (including having government officials and scientists straight up murdered) for some gold medals, it doesn't paint a very comforting pictures of what he's willing to do for... other stuff. Like getting back the frozen assets of this supporters. &&[deleted]&&https://youtu.be/fOgwTW8I6OM?t=5&&[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80168079?trackId=13752289)&&It is man, it’s on Netflix and worth a watch. The lengths the Russians went through to cheat the system is just mind blowing. Like spy movie shit!&&Watching it right now due to the promise of insanity. 

Edit: holy shit this is insane. &&Netflix&&Honestly I love the long form style. It's perfect for putting on when you have some mindless task to do for a while. &&It's under 3 hours. &&Here are some of the timestamps for this documentary btw, since it is very long.

I think Grigory needed an escape plan (or he thought he might need one), and this seemed like his best bet.&&I assumed Grigory was being paid to consult. &&I can't see if anyone answered this question so I will. The documentarian actually mentioms that this was a bit of editing to speed the pace of the movie. He had been conversing with Grigory for something like 6 months at that point and they were on very friendly terms. He says he debated about including it but it was hard to include without messing up the pace of the movie.&&The last sentence. I’m now annoyed I had to read all that for you to answer your own question.&&Yeah, if you listen to the Joe Rogen podcast with Brian Fogel, he mentions this. They had to cut a lot of the first discussions with Grigory for flow. Essentially, yeah, Grigory knew something was going down and wanted someone he could use as an escape to the states. Brian wasn't aware of it at the time.&&Honestly people in his position sometimes just lose it and go AWOL.

Perhaps he was bitter about how he was treated by the Russian services. Perhaps he felt his excellent skills weren't getting enough recognition. Perhaps he felt guilt and simply wanted the world to know the truth.

Honestly there are so many reasons a human being could do what he did I didn't even question it.&&The guy was an amateur cyclist, so he asked people in the business if he could dope and try to intentionally beat the system. The American former-head of WADA couldn't help, but recommended the current Russian head, Grigory.

The guy states that he began filming/talking to Grigory before German television released their info about state sponsored cheating in WADA, and before Grigory even knew the guy wanted to try and dope past the system. So they basically became close before the shit started to really hit the fan. When guy finally asked Grigory about helping him test his samples, he seemed to think that it might be an interesting thing because he was an amateur and ""wasn't a big deal"".

Either way, the guy got the impression that Grigory was involved in helping Russia cheat from the start, just not necessarily to the extent it went.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCBIpKCdI&&This is the interview I listened to.  Rich also talked with Lance Armstrong. Both interesting. &&The big difference is the *systemic* corruption, literally people inside the system.

In America if it's widespread, its freelancers. People getting drugs from wherever and trying to *beat* the testers. Doper/drug testers still an adversarial game

All of the dirty groups that have come to light have been *extremely* dependent on small circles, and focused on non-detection (BALCO, Oregon, etc) with undetectable drugs.

USADA has definitely had improprieties, like forgiving a rash of stimulant tests at the 88 trials (stimulants that would have gotten a no-questions-asked ban had they happened at the games) but I'm not aware even of rumors of active complicity. With no conspiracy, there's no thread to pull that could unravel *an entire nation's program*.
&&The US isn't necessarily better at hiding it - we have no centralized state sponsored doping program specifically because our athletes are not employees of the government.  But just because we do not have a state level doping program does not mean our athletes are universally clean - individual s certainly to cheat with PED's.  But it is on an individual or at most team level.  So if one person is caught, it doesn't spread out from there.  It stops with that athlete because they are organizationally not connected to the rest of the US athletes.

In Russia, they are all basically on the same team, and move in lockstep.  That sets Russia up for an all-or-nothing type approach.  One leak gets out or one test fails, it has the tendency to spread to the entire country's team because they are organizationally connected.

Centralized organization vs. de-centralized organization!&&I read this factoid once about one of Lance’s first victories in the TDF. 

It was along the lines of if you removed everyone who was eventually busted for doping from that race, something like the guy who finished in 26th place would have been the winner. It’s pervasive in nearly every sport. &&Absolutely. There’s been plenty of US riders in the post-USPS/Armstrong that have tested positive, but their actions have been largely spun as individuals. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s still some suppression of positive results from the big name guys. Most of the recent positives have come out of the amateur ranks, and there’s been much more testing in the past few years. My teammates that have been tested wear it like a badge of honor; they’re stoked that they’re racing well enough that people care to check them. 

Unfortunately, I know too many guys who treat doping much too closely like something that, if they take the burden of health issues/getting caught then the results will be worth it. Like taking a corner too aggressively and chopping other riders, they think that the risk of crashing or getting relegated is worth the position gain. I’m just glad that most of them don’t have the connections or cleverness to actually cheat. Most people are caught in really basic honeypots lately. One dude used a work email with his full name to discuss a full doping schedule for masters nationals. &&Holy shit.  I think there's some clitoral enlargement going on.&&Some of the genuine reasoning for the prohibition really is safety.

The East Germans, for example, did some severe damage to some women's bodies in particular. And you know for sure that with  green light many people will not only choose to push the drugs that hard, but could also be *forced* to.

&&Konstantinos Kenteris (Greek, 200m champ in 2000 and 2001) iirc was notorious for racing *very* seldom as well, iirc.... And also believed to often be unavailable for testing. 

Then ""skipped a test"" at the 04 Olympics (scooter accident that was believed to be a farce)&&I think the general consensus is not that the filmmaker knew beforehand, but that Grigory did. So Grigory started doing it for that reason and as time passed and events unfolded, the filmmaker also started shaping the narrative more into line with that. Which was in turn was only possible due to Grigory being keenly aware of everything and how it is going to unfold.&&It's important to remember this documentary had an angel investor and lots of funding as a result. Can't really remember the details. Maybe they knew they had the story at the time of funding?&&You could make the argument that setting up a doping ring has lower stakes than rigging a foreign election. When they got caught doping athletes, what was the consequence? They got banned from the Olympics for one year, and will probably be back within a few games. No wars are started, no missiles are launched - it's a pretty consequence-free crime. Especially since it boosted Putin's approvals.

But if they're caught with their fingers in a US election, that's a full international incident that easily rolls over into a military conflict.&&No, Russians are just taking any type of competition extremely seriously, especially an international one. They think that it’s a very big shame to lose such a thing and that it will show the country as a bad and weak one. Every time their national football team loses (and it happens all the time lol) they take it as a personal insult.&&Time to create Captain America&&Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But mistake! Yakuza boss die! Yakuza very mad! I hide fishing boat, come to America. No English, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car and new woman. Darryl save life.

My big secret. I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. Beta blockers always in system! The best!&&I need some beta blockers &&It's the same principle, exactly: discard all respect for the established rules, prioritize your own profit and agenda, shut up or ignore all critical voices etc etc. &&>willing to do politically, like rigging elections.

Willing? Putin has blatantly rigged their domestic elections multiple times.&&This is what a large chunk of the esports community do. &&[deleted]&&Oh shit, I never noticed that connection in the types of events they won. I definitely suspected them, esp. with recent team sky controversies. &&oh definitely. Lance might’ve been a giant douche, but he also had potential and work ethic. &&Some people can’t distinguish from “doping” and “state sponsored doping”


This is like if the FBI was helping American athletes cheat. &&Also FIFA is probably the most corrupt sports authority so yeah, game on&&In fairness, I watched them at the Confederations Cup earlier this year, they won't be in it for long. All the PED's in the world can't save that dogshit excuse for a football team. It'll take a miracle for them to get out of their group. &&They should be banned from hosting too. They bought off FIFA. What an openly scummy country. The world community will not forget.&&[deleted]&&FIFA has to be sorted out I would actually like to see UEFA split from FIFA and start their own rival to the World Cup.  Anyone can tell that Qatar and Russia bought their events.  And now now other country wants to touch them with a barge pole because of the risk of being accused of corruption.&&the ties of IOC head thomas bach to russian government and the obvious: doing nothing about the incidents at sochi. except from banning a few athletes. no fines, no stripping medals, he himself is still the head of the IOC...&&yeah its not entirely without merit, it was interesting to see that in addition to massive amounts of doping, you also had to be a supreme athlete to beat other dopers. and when the premise of, im going to dope and win and prove a point gets blown up, thats a real wrench in your plans, and he was able to still save a film.

one thing i still dont get, he wanted to meet Grigory so that he could have samples that would pass tests. but the way that Grigory was getting clean tests was by manually fucking with the samples, not some sophisticated way of actually producing a clean sample. so im not sure what Fogel set out to prove with his wanting to get a clean sample. but i digress, and overall the doc was badass, and i would recommend it to anyone. &&That scene where he dumps the folder on the council's desk and they just sit there with their jaws dropped.

It's like showing a bunch of people that America is really lizard people.&&I sort of didn't notice the transition from just trying to not get caught during an event, to exposing an international scandal until it had ended and I was thinking back on it. &&I had the same experience. I was really bored one night and figured I watch this Doc about doping. Then it turns into this insane story about the Russians and the Olympics!. I dont think i paused it for the entire duration.&&That reminds me of the docuseries called The Jynx about a guy who has been the suspect of a few murders. I expected it to end rather ambiguously like Making a Murderer but the accidental finding at the end left me floored.&&That someone gave you the right pitch. It’s much more shocking that way&&I totally second this, its a wild ride. I still have trouble explaining the story without it seeming so creepy, just watch it without knowing anything about it.&&HBO docs have some really great ones that have the unfolding of events. MY personal favorite is the Paradise Lost trilogy, and obviously The Jinx. I think a lot of the greatest documentaries of all time have that element of real life unfolding in front of them, i.e. Thin Blue Line, Hearts of Darkness, Grey Gardens&&The podcast The Dollop did an episode about it. I think they made it when the article came out before there was even a documentary. That story just got progressively weirder and weirder. I've been wanting to watch it forever but I couldn't find anywhere to stream it. Now that you reminded me I need to look again.&&Anybody wanna let me borrow their HBO login?  (But seriously, I have to look into a subscription.)&&Where can a simple Australian find this to watch?&&I might not be remembering correctly but wasn't the main guy's poor performance attributed to something on his bike breaking?&&which would be nonsense when the whole point was we can never know, since they prove we've failed at detection for even the most well known contenders, an entire olympic team, and so many of the people involved have a reason to look the other way.

what they did make clear was how he had absolutely no hope of competing without it, even as a dedicated athlete his times were nowhere near good enough, though he did have definitive gains from it.

pretty sure they were just setting up a premise for why someone might get into steroids, and how prevalent it was. you are supposed to ask, is it the steroids, is it the training, some kind of genetic advantage, who knows? this is why they compete, and also why they cheat
&&Well, the doping regimen was still being tweaked, but then the world started caving in.&&Not to get too political in this sub, but it goes to show Putin's true nature. Everything boils down to ""how can he use this to become more rich and more powerful?""&&Easy there Edgy Bravado&&He's an excellent host.  People feel comfortable talking with him.  You get a side of personalities that generally won't come out in an interview or talk.  IMO that's a really important trait.  The dude may not be the smartest guy in the world, but he is reasonably intelligent.  He may not be an expert in a few fields, but he generally tries to educate himself on something before making an opinion.  These traits make for a refreshing and interesting podcast.  

That being said, I'm not gonna watch his podcast to educate myself. It's enjoyable and educating on a basic information level&&Him and Marc Maron.  I just listened to the one with Darron Aronofsky.  It was good, but the one with Paul Thomas Anderson is still my fave!&&Explains the rage :-\&&I can't even imagine how that dude was feeling when the Russian scientist started telling him all this shit. Probably, ""What in the fuck have I gotten myself into?"" Started with a pretty decent idea for a documentary then unravels a global conspiracy.&&Yeah, I have almost zero interest in the Olympics or sports in general (all I remember hearing about during Sochi is the shitty athlete apartments) and this movie was still fascinating and really scary. Russia is terrifying and Putin is... very bad.&&His point still stands. Don’t you see how much of a blissful ignorance it is to attribute these actions to the person of Putin? So he’s the only politician in the world who uses his influence to gain more money/power? 

It is about olympics because olympics are pure politics. We have Russia China and the US as the 3 major powers in the olympics who invest TREMENDOUSLY in Olympic sports in the last 30 years but somehow you think that all this traffic of influence is only related to Putin? 

So we are to believe that all these athletes competing evenly with superhuman Russians are just the Rocky’s of their sports facing the malevolent Drago’s? 

It baffles me how every doping scandal only serves as a scapegoat for everybody else. If I have 10x the amount of testosterone you have and train just as much as you do because I’m a state sponsored athlete, how the hell am I barely beating you in a given competition that is a display of physical capabilities? &&It wasn't as much for Sochi as for the whole Crimea thing. The fact that he fulfilled long existing irredentist ideas with a well-executed land grab was much more paramount. But of course the Olympics were close.

2011-2012 were probably the ebb of Putin's approval, people definitely became more negative about status-quo. A good part of that was due to Medvedev's term corruption scandals, especially ones related to the military (Serdyukov's performance as a Minister of Defence was a big source of outrage among conservative russians, who were and remain a majority).

My thought, this whole controversy of being banned from the Olympics doesn't have potential to damage Putin's popularity any sensible amount. Not after the shock and recovery of 2014-2017, with the key political events de-facto won by Putin (Crimea bridge, Donbass, Syria & the whole Middle East, 2016 US elections).&&You don't think that happened in China?
&&""Even if there is another woman in this bed, and there's not, are you suggesting I would be so low-energy I couldn't handle you both? Only Jeb would be so pathetic. Sad.""&&Wasn't me.&&Ha, reminds me of a story Dennis Rodman (or Carmen Electra) told not the Howard Stern show.   She walked into his hotel room to find him in bed with 2 women, and with the most serious of faces, he explained that he had no idea how the girls got there. He said that they must've fell from the sky.&&It's been said that US anti doping tries to catch cheaters while Russian (and the rest of the world) anti doping tries to help cheaters.&&[It Wasn't Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75fyFAh29XY)&&[deleted]&&Always knew I was a bit of an idiot. Thanks for the confirmation. &&They need sweepers like barbershops do for hair clippings. &&Yeah, wasn't he in the top ten of the race before his shifter broke or something?&&Yeah but the documentary would still be fucked. &&>He placed lower because of having issues with his bicycle 

My first instinct was that he roided out and threw it at someone in the crowd.&&Yeah, i know that but he needed to place higher to make his point for the documentary. He probably would have placed higher and even if he didn't, there's no doubt his training was enhanced and he was stronger. It just doesn't make for a good documentary if he has to say ""Well i felt better and i would have placed higher i think"" rather than showing the results.&&Mmm no, not entirelt. He admits in the documentary that he was just ""never meant to be a world class bicyclist"". &&I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking that.&&More money = better PEDs

The richest athletes are the best ones.

Usain Bolt, Mo Farah, Michael Phelps and Conor McGregor are all probably on steroids that the people making the tests don’t know exist yet so can’t test for them&&No, comrade. Fellow american here. Putin great leader. Putin great people. These are lies spread by bad free press here. Putin so good he fixed that problem in Russia

Obama is weak. And Clinton is crooked. We are better with Trump now. MAGA&&So are we to not connect the dots then?&&Makes sense. Obviously tons of athletes from every country dope but in a lot of cases it's hard to tell if it's a state program or just down to individuals. &&>  And even with a mountain of evidence against them, they basically just flat out deny anything happened.

Putin is the type of person where if his wife catches him with someone else on his dick he would still deny it happened. &&Aren't pretty much all “highest achivement sports” athletes use PEDs? It's just a matter of barely clearing the allowed percentages on tests. I doubt any non-juiced person could compete at the olympics.&&[deleted]&&Ehm. I don’t remember a single day in the past twenty years when a person would change their views on Putin. So, no, the majority of Russians were still pro-Putin before Sochi. &&It really is par for the course for Putin. A consistently predictable pattern of corruption. Coincidence and controversy abounds around this sadistic ego-tripping scapegoating denialist. A modern Stalin no better than the spoiled puppet dictator Assad he protects. 

- Involvement in their missiles downing the civilian airliner MH17? Deny. Have state-run media conduct internal investigation. Big surprise it absolves them of blame despite Dutch Independent Investigation report pointing the blame wholly on Russia.

- Denial and scapegoating of links in the Panama Papers.

- Involvement in the coup on parliament with Yeltsin. 

- Involvement in the stolen money that was supposed to feed the starving in St. Petersburg

- Convenience/coincidence surrounding the assassination of opposition leader growing momentum against Putin.

- Convenience/coincidence of Russian apartment bombings that just so happened to help Putin rise in popularity.

- Blatant lying regarding troops in Ukraine

- Blatant lying and denial of involvement with the assassination of Russian FSB agent, Alexander Litvinenko (largest most expensive investigation in Scotland Yard's history pointing the finger at Russia and specifically Putin).

- Numerous journalists who were critical of Putin murdered.

- Blatant lying about directing cyber-attacks in America.

- Blatant lying about directing the doping scandal (that led to the embarrassment of being banned from future Olympic events)

**It really makes me wonder why Putin who purports himself to be such a strong leader is too cowardly to be upfront with his actions**.

Appealing to fear and *using* fear as intimidation and leverage is commonplace and well-documented. It's an oligarchy with a mafioso crime boss at its head. This is not a conspiracy, this is evidence that continues to mound. For anyone interested in delving further:

For The Shock Doctrine, I recommend the thoroughly-cited book, but I linked the full doc Klein's husband made that's a good summary. [Here's the 6 minute trailer](https://youtu.be/EuyRdJupbvU). It doesn't just focus on Russia, but uses them as a case-study for the thesis.

The Russian state is ranked poorly on government [transparency andcorruption](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016), and on [safety for Journalists](https://rsf.org/en/ranking)—in both cases, the bottom 20th percentile in the world. Not exactly where a superpower wants to be in rankings.&&Yeah when they found a way to open the unopenable piss bottles without being detected until well after...crazy.  Part of me thinks they built some jig out of metal or something and twisted it&&I don't listen to Joe Rogan's Podcast (I just haven't), but I love the longer form interview podcasts like Marc Maron's because they seem to really relax the interviewees. Feels like real conversations instead of press tour stuff.&&Hang on — we talking about the same Joe Rogan Podcast here? *Under* 3 hours? Was the studio on fire?&&Oh a brief one. Perfect. &&Or he just had been doing the exact same thing for hundreds of athletes for years and didn't mind sharing a glimpse into the doping antidoping world that he had been thrust into. 

Exposing this double life probably was a natural progression once he was on Putin's hit list.  Grigory knew the system is broken and that >99% of Olympic/Tour de France athletes are doping.  I bet he wanted the ""it's so easy to cheat/the system is flawed story to come out,"" but I find it hard to believe that he wanted the ""I have been helping a state sponsored doping program, take all of my property and force me into exile away from my family"" story to come out.      

If he wanted that he and his family could have left much sooner and he could have helped the initial German investigation instead of trying to cover up and help hide the program. &&Not me! I jumped to your comment then back to his answer &&hey, he's just thinking aloud! sure, he could have gone back and deleted 80% of that once he figured it out. but, there's something to be said for preserving your inner monologue and not deleting information &&Yeah that's a pretty big distinction, good point.&&How could you know the US doesn’t have a similar program? It’s not like it would be out in the open.&&Also, if you're a fading athlete, why not write a book and blow the whistle on the whole thing for one last payday? You can do that in the US and not die, unlike Russia. &&Cycling is a most likely the worst though. It's common in many sports, in cycling it's endemic. &&> Some of the genuine reasoning for the prohibition really is safety.


Its not really though.  All testing does is drive people to use newer, untested drugs, that are developed primarily for the ability to not be detected. 


If they were allowed to use drugs, then everyone would just use the most effective, and safest drugs. 


>with green light many people will not only choose to push the drugs that hard, but could also be forced to


That is already happening.  Allowing drug use would only make it safer, and allow athletes to be better monitored by doctors. &&Of course it’s much lower stakes and the consequences will hopefully result in more athletes second guessing whether they should dope or not. 

A military conflict would have to be initiated by a Republican controlled congress if the ongoing investigation finds collusion. You think the U.S. and it’s citizens would ask for military conflict with Russia? I just don’t see that happening. At most strengthen our current sanctions on them. &&Putin has invaded or fostered civil wars in multiple Eastern European countries without any real consequence.  He's had people assassinated on other country's soil with no repercussions.  I don't think its out of the question for him to feel that he could get away with it, or that the blow back would be worth the risk.&&Weren’t they caught riggering with a US election like last year lol. &&Winning international competitions is also a fantastic way to boost the morale of the nation. They've been having economic troubles for quite some time, so this is another incentive to run their doping program. &&Winter soldier*&&Where is this from?&&You just have to look at the majority of the British press' reaction to Froome's failed test.

(not to mention David Walsh's general love in with Team Sky since they brought him on tour with them).&&Absolutely, I’m sure he was an amazing athlete to begin with, and then he took it to the next level by using all those EPD’s.

Would he have been able to win without them? I guess we’ll never know.&&Easy comrade, every team they face will just accidentally get some sort of serious flu, or maybe unstoppable diarrhea the day before the matches.  &&they are in a easy group, so they can still get out of groups, Uruguay is first for sure, but i hope Egypt gets second place.&&waka waka eheh eheh&&UEFA is just as corrupt as fifa is, even tho he has been removed, Platini shows this.  So nothing would really change.   Not really sure if there's a way to fix this without letting it up to chance...but even then some countries would have more more slips of paper ""mistakenly"" put in than others or their ball would be weighted differently or something.  There's just too many greedy pieces of shit in the world willing/wanting/trying to take advantage the ridiculous amount of money in soccer.&&Which ties? &&That part was absolutely not clear, I agree 100%. That said, I believe we simply never got to get to that point because of the events that took place. Lance *did* pass tests from multiple places and I believe Grigory was working towards setting up Bryan with information he needed about how the drugs were metabolized in his body to know when to change doses/stop/continue. I do not know this, since it became necessary for the doc to go in another direction though.

However I very much enjoyed that aspect about the film, I really appreciated this build up of new questions and loose ends only to have it focus in on my biggest one, who is Grigory Rodchenkov and why is he helping this man he doesn't know pass a drug test, and leave me anxiously hanging on the others. I would like to see a film about how Lance did it, and this film did act like it was going to be that film, but it became another one out of necessity and I am all the happier for it. I'm glad they kept the beginning, in a huge way it builds mystery and tension, it sets the stage for what the normal behaviors and activity of it's characters are and in so doing shows us just how far off the deep end things go once they start sliding into the abyss. &&I thought people already knew we were all lizards in disguise over here. &&Best scene in the movie. In the rogan Interview he said it was like telling them the easter bunny, santa clause and tooth fairy don't exist, all at once. &&That was an incredible scene indeed. Crazy how some of that council were nearly in tears.&&One of the things I pulled out of the documentary is how on the surface, you may see some light brushing of illegalities or maybe even things you know shouldn't be happening, but underneath those light brushings is a entire other painting. An entire other portrait displaying an entirely different time line and message. 

It's almost equivocal to modern day politics where we see these illegalities happening but in time we come ~~toheseimeo~~ to realize that what we see is only the surface and the extreme complexity of these hidden paintings and messages are sometimes far too unbelievable for the human mind to comprehend.

In the documentary we saw this.

Nothing is as it seems.

Edit: apparently autocorrect isn't as it seems either. How it got toheseimeo from ""to"" is beyond me.&&How is that even possible? &&That’s because it’s a very well made documentary. &&The podcast ""The Dollop"" did an episode about it before the movie came out and it's hilarious. I think it's like episode 2 or 3.. if you lied the movie, I recommend listening to that as well. &&Checkout ""Chicken People"" blind too, wow what a world..&&Forbidden lie$ is an unbelievably good documentary along these lines. If you haven't seen it you should check it out. &&I think that's what made Restrepo so hard for many people to watch.  It's one thing to watch thousands of extras get cut down in the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan - watching grown men on the verge of a breakdown talking about a firefight their friends didn't survive is totally different. &&I saw it on Netflix&&Yeah, his shifter breaks and he's stuck in a single gear for one of the stages. They didn't really cover whether that was the main reason for his overall performance, as the Russia stuff had become the main point of interest by that point and the race result was more of a footnote.&&Yup. The derailleur - the mechanism on the rear wheel that shifts gears - broke and he had to bike a good distance with it broken. 

Physically the doping improved him a lot.&&Yaa, his derailleur broke which made it impossible to shift gears. Try going up a hill on a bike one gear too high, nevermind a mountain.&&Yes but previously he had performed really well and was going well until the bike broke. 

I think the loss of hope and frustration impacted the later stages because it seemed as if he gave up and just wanted to finish. &&I believe all pro athletes “cheat” and/or walk the fine line. It’s amazing how all athletes have high testosterone levels, just not enough to say “doping!” When your livelihood and millions/billions of dollars are on the line - you do whatever it takes to win. There’s a reason no pro nfl players get caught doping, it’s because all teams are really good at hiding it.&&I wouldn't be that cynical - it's more like ""How do I appease Russian billionaire oligarchs while also maximizing Russia's (and therefore my own) soft power on the international stage?""&&So does Trump, lol&&I agree. Unlike many podcasters he's having people on to have a conversation with them. Not to espouse his own views most of the time. Don't get me wrong he expresses his views but he's more interested in talking to the person rather than trying to make some sort of point out of each podcast.

&&He handled that shit with grace too.&&Definitely suggest listening to his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. He breaks down how it went from a doping documentary to ""oh shit, Russia doped everyone.""&&[deleted]&&How did a terrible olympics facility lead to a leap in his ratings?&&My main thing with all of this is, if the Russians are doping, the US and everyone who has ever medaled in the last decade is doping too.&&[deleted]&&Yep. 

http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-23/sports/sp-30338_1_drug-testing&&Sure about that statement?

https://www.ocregister.com/2009/08/01/early-effort-to-drug-test-olympic-athletes-kept-secret/

""Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency and a International Olympic Committee member from Canada, criticized the informal testing program, saying the United States “was running a drug counseling program.”""

There's plenty of former top dogs that have testified that the United States ran doing programs that allowed athletes to use gear.

""“There was a feeling at the USOC that the Russians were getting (away with doping) and that we should be getting ahead of (the issue),” Dardik said. “But I also remember a lot of USOC meetings talking about testing there were a lot of people concerned ‘if we do this are we going to ruin our team?’

“It was really political.”""

This was written in 2009 btw....&&:)&&I think he was, but what was surprising was that he actually finished in tenth during the non-PED race. 

Edit: he finished in 14th&&IIRC ran out of battery. Modern high end shifting is electronic, but you have to remember to charge it up every few rides. &&Not really, the whole point was to prove how easy it was to dope and get away with it when you have the right team behind you.

The result would matter if nothing happened to his bike, but he still proved the point. &&He roided out and bent his bicycle over his own head actually, deleted scenes are good &&TBH he placed higher than he would have without the doping, so he partially succeeded&&You only have to charge it like twice a year...

There is more to it than that. Its all about Genetics. Some people respond better to drugs than others, they get more out of each Unit they take, and tolerate the side effects better.  Some guys will turn into a sweaty, acne-riddled, insomniac  with no appetite at 2000 ng/dl of test and orals, while others can tolerate twice the drugs and be just fine.

&&[deleted]&&Well, if you skip past the 20 minutes of plugs he starts the show off with, it's just under 3 hours.&&Yeah I made it about halfway through his first paragraph.&&US Olympic teams are organized differently than in Russia.  It's not that our teams of athletes and organizations are saintly, they don't have the Federal government bankrolling them.  The US Gymnastics team and the US Basketball team are not organizationally affiliated or under a single ""umbrella"" of the Federal Gov't.

In Russia, the athletes are all literally employed by the Russian government - it's one big team.  So their basketball and gymnastics teams *are* centrally organized and they do report to a single entity in the Russian government.&&[Good idea!](https://www.amazon.com/Juiced-Times-Rampant-Roids-Baseball/dp/0060746416)

[Armstrong one too](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Race-Inside-Hidden-France/dp/034553042X)&&Actually cycling is probably the least worse now.

The anti doping protocols they're all subject to is pretty intense. Way more strict than other sports due to The history of PEDs in cycling. The biopassport is pretty hard to beat for blood doping and the classic PEDs just glow in tests.

But there's still cheating. It's more marginal but it's still there. See most recently with Chris Froome who likely was taking asthma meds to lose weight and increase recovery.&&It actually is, and was one of the leading reasons for initiating the prohibition to begin with.

And if they were allowed... They'd use the most effective. Desperate people *will* take rat poison if it could give them an edge. 

You'd have a case of desperation driving harsher usage. Because if you're using but not making it, someone else must be busing something else.

It could get very ugly very fast. 

Remember the cyclists having heart attacks from EPO? Yeah. Like that. 

You fail to realize that the *vast*majority of athletes are training on limited resources. They're not going to have teams of doctors monitoring them. 

I don't see safety improving, tbh, unless there is a *small* permitted list of low risk drugs that are highly effective. &&Not on this level. A equivalent would be like they send thousands of agents into every level of electorate and change the result to whatever they want.

Quote of the day&&Yeah I don't know either. I mean the dude was in witness protection and likely had people out to kill him. They stopped talking about cycling less than half way through. &&What I mean is, the two parts sort of blended into one while I was watching.

The second that guy started telling the story about sneaking into the labs to replace samples is when I would have said, ""Fuck this, I'm out.""&&What are you talking about? It's the Crimean annexation that boosted his rating, not the Olympics.

that is a depressing statement&&Putin could still pull this off, he never lost support, and most probably never will within the span of his life.&&Russia hosted and won the most medals. &&Sorry, that was just an example of how little I pay attention to sports. According to the movie the doping stuff was a really big news story at the time, but I was totally unfamiliar with all of it. &&There's difference between US or French athletes doping, and Russia having a state sponsored doping program using the anti-doping agencies to pull it off.&&>They didn't have 10x the amount of testosterone, or anything even remotely close to that number...... that is physically impossible.

That's not true at all.

Say you're on the spectrum of normal with 400-1200ng/dl of test. If you're on the lower end of normal and have around 400ng/dl, but you're supplementing with 500mg/wk of Test E you'd be sitting around 4000ng/dl blood value. This is a totally generic one compound with no stack to up anything else. You'd be sitting at ""10x normal"" in relation to the hypothetical (but very real possibility) of someone who is on the lower range of normal. 

I forgot to mention that 500mg/wk of Test E is a standard ""bulking"" first time dose. This does not account for elite level competitors who likely have been using AAS/PEDs for multiple years. &&> I really don't know what you're talking about. If you can show some proof of state-sponsored doping programs by any other country, I'm more than willing to read it. Where's the report?

We didnt have proof about Russia until all of this happened. It is silly and naive to think that Russia is the only powerhouse nation with a state sponsored plan. &&They’re not saying it’s not related to putin they’re saying Russia is not the only one. 


He doesn’t need proof to suggest a theory. That’s literally like saying “Arnold never tested positive for steroids so unless you have proof I think he’s clean”&&14th&&It's also a LOT easier when you know when your test is going to be, VS random testing. Not that random testing stops guys 100% either, but you need to change the way you dope in order to reliably beat it.

For reference, check out how many fighters have been busted since the UFC started working with USADA. Guys are getting popped all the time now whereas back in the day you had dudes like [Ubereem](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L3iNi6fJ79g/mqdefault.jpg) fighting for *years* without getting caught by anything other than the eye test. &&although he was also struggling with his radio just prior so maybe it was that and the derailleur. &&Thanks!

Overtime I believe the Oligarchs have learnt that Putin can still be pressured through damaging his political image within Russia even at the expense of going to jail. &&That implies he isn't the richest Russian.&&He does. Russia's current ruling class has a mob structure. Putin knows his power is strong as long as the most powerful people in the country are loyal to him. He makes sure not only to punish disloyalty, but also to generously reward loyalty, as mob bosses usually do to keep the morale high. The bulk of high profile government corruption in Russia is basically the redistribution of wealth and power within this multilayer mob structure according to these basic relations.&&You can't let one of the nobles become too powerful, and it is easy to take put one who threatens to establish the nice situation for everyone else (among thr nobility).

I don't think it goes all the way to our President tho lol cuz that's not how it works here.&&Yea scheduled tests are easier to beat.

I’m a big MMA fan myself, you see how badly it affected people, Victor Belfort a good example too.

I do still think they are using, most of them. They just found better ways to beat the test. Like Paulo Costa is definitely on stuff, DC too.

I say DC because, he has been wrestling at the top level for 20 or so years, his body should of been broken down by now. But somehow he started a new sport in his 30s that’s really hard on your body and still fights at the top level now.

Plenty of examples of those guys. 

It has cleaned up the sport to the public eye with USADA, but I don’t think it’s very clean... I don’t think any sport is clean anymore. &&Young Jamie, pull those suggestions up &&What is up, mothafuckersssssssssss????&&I'm not criticizing. I would rather he gets it out of the way up front instead of interrupting the show later. &&Isn't a double tap included in the Mozambique drill? &&Nambia salutes you.
&&A well thought out and well crafted message, only to be brought down by autocorrect.&&Playing the long con.&&... by forbes lists from official sources. &&How do you know that? There certainly is more than enough public interest. Unless the opposite is proven to be true Russia's doping remains unique for it's scope and state influence.

I also don't doubt one bit that doping is done in western countries, China, African nations. But it remains to be seen whether it occurs on such a government enforced level.&&No sport is clean and honestly, I don't have a problem with that in most cases outside of combat sports where your main goal is to damage another human. If somehow all PEDs disappeared from sports within the next year and everything was 100% clean, performance would drop off so hard compared to what fans are used to athletes and teams everywhere would receive so much hate.

We want to see guys performing at the levels they are when they take PEDs tbh. I don't give a shit if someone like Messi or Ronaldo or Zlatan or Federer/Nadal are on PEDs, they are simply incredible players to watch.&&I am just saying that on YouTube he doesn't plug anything just a few Google ads&&He has such a good voice I don't even care.

7mins of pure chase glory!&&That’s kind of a dick move. The reason permits exist is because someone could have died just racing through the streets. &&This is one of the bits of trivia I go oh that’s really effective in the movie but also it’s not okay.

Oh what crap!  Several of the car-chase sequences were staged (including at least two times that Hackman's car hits other cars - plus the time he hits the cement wall - you'll notice that the cameras were placed perfectly to capture these supposedly random accidents, telling you that the crew knew in advance that they were going to happen).

The guy basically was the best stunt driver of his generation, and is credited with helping create the art of the movie car chase as we know it.

With the aforementioned chase sequence in French Connection, an accounting from Hickman I read said that he allegedly sprung it on Friedkin as a surprise of sorts. Friedkin wasn't happy with the way Hickman choreographed the car chase for a closed set setting, so Hickman told Friedkin to climb in his car, and then drove like a maniac down public roads while Friedkin shot from the open trunk, not knowing what the hell Hickman was going to do next.

Also, morbid fun fact, Hickman was James Dean friend and first to the scene of the fatal car accident that claimed Dean's life.

Oh my.  Are these the next batch of people that we're going to talk about?&&So...none of this is a good thing. Like, shouldn't there be a huge number of lawsuits involved about this, possibly even criminal ones rather than just civil ones?

> Discussing the Brooklyn-filmed chase, Friedkin said he got permission to shoot on the elevated train after giving a New York official (who said the production was “crazy”) $40,000 and a one-way ticket to Jamaica.

Isn't that admitting to bribery of a public official, among a number of other crimes?&&He directed *To Live And Die In LA* which opens with a fantastic montage of a counterfeiter printing money. When they filmed it, for authenticity they got a real counterfeiter to walk through the steps while they filmed - engraving the plates, getting the paper and ink, running the press, cutting the bills, artificially wearing them... and somewhere during the process someone asked ""Has it occurred to anyone that we are actually counterfeiting money here?""&&The part in the chase where Hackman hits another car and keeps driving involved a non-actor who was leaving his block to go to work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrKYf2yNBf0&&Friedkin is a gifted director who has made some absolutely stunning classic movies, and also is a psychotic asshole who lost every friend he had in Hollywood ages ago.

You've heard of the ""method"" actor?  Friedkin is the ""method"" *director.*  If the script called for the actor to be in terror, he fired off guns randomly on set.  If the script called for the actor to be hurt, he would hurt them.  If the script called for the actor to be angry, he'd slap them.

The results were good...but not nearly good enough to justify that kind of treatment.&&Highly reckless and selfish.

Irregardless of how cool it looks/ed.

A different time huh ?&&i'm surprised nobody mentioned bullit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31JgMAHVeg0&&My sister does special effects and makeup on film and they are made to go on a course about safety when filming and why it's important to get permission. An example that was given was a director that wanted to film a hospital bed getting hit by a train on tracks. So when they did this without permission or any safety regulations a piece of the trolly managed to catch someone in the head, killing them. The director or producer I think was sentenced to prison for involuntary manslaughter.

The film is Midnight Rider I think. &&Damn, that's reckless. What if they had run down a pedestrian? No film is worth that risk.&&Just watched the chase scene on youtube.  Was way more terrifying knowing it wasn't staged.&&One of the best shots in NY film history. It really shows you the nitty gritty of 1970's NYC better than any film. Man I want to watch this again tonight.&&Friedkin was very candid about it on Marc Maron's podcast, sounded pretty ashamed of himself: a recklessly ambitious young director who cared more about the shot than people's safety. He considered it just dumb luck that nobody was killed.&&Watch it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEloJ5venk

I don't see any sequences at 90mph. Barely 40. Some of it is not shot from the car at all but from a dolly. Friedkin is nostalgicising this. &&top that nolan. on a serious note tho, the chase didnt seem that impressive when i saw the movie, probably because i'd seen other chases with modern movies. &&I have a real hard time with people boasting about or championing this kind of reckless behaviour.

I assume that he tried to convince the cameramen to do it before he realized only he himself was willing to do it.

Fun fact #2: The shots of De Niro behind the wheel were actually shot in a modified right-hand-drive car; the vehicle is being driven by a stunt driver to De Niro's right and the speed is REAL. The same with shots of Jonathan Pryce in the back of the car, the shots over McElhone's shoulder, etc. And man does that really make the scene.&&The screenplay was written by david mammet under anothet name.

The article talks about how he was invited to document a real exorcism with the church, much more recently.

Edit: I would like to highlight something he said in an interview about the Blu-Ray transfer:

""Because the Blu-Ray laser reads and writes closer to the disc than the DVD you get more detail. The color is richer.""

The Blu-Ray laser is more narrow, allowing for more data on a disc, it's not closer. It also sounds like he's saying that image detail on a given disc format is reliant upon how close the laser is.&&No love for Bullitt?&&One that you missed is the original ""Gone in 60 Seconds"".  It stars H.B. Halicki.  It is available on Amazon Prime.  It may be the longest car chase in movie history.  And, lots of shots of Ocean Blvd. in Long Beach, CA.  &&Tarantino's Death Proof has some amazing car chase moments as well.  &&The original Luc Besson Taxi deserves to be in there as well.&&I'm also a fan of the last quarter of Deathproof.&&The Seven-Ups is so good. The car chases from Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven-Ups were all coordinated by the same guy, making them some sort of ""car chase trilogy"".

I would also recommend The Driver by Walter Hill, which has some pretty great chases as well.&&""The Blues Brothers"" - at the time the most destructive car chase ever.

And if it ends with Illinois nazis* plunging to their doom from an unfinished bridge, so much the better.

*I _hate_ Illinois nazis&&You should watch To Live and Die in LA another movie directed by William Friedkin with an incredible car chase scene.  Starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe.

Also, *video of the scene in youtube*, for people who ctrl+f like me.&&Hickman is involved in three of the greatest film car chases, besides The French Connection, he was the driver in the famous Bullitt chase, and my favorite, the chase in The Seven Ups.

It was full of strip clubs, adult movie theatres, hookers and drug dealers; I went there next time in 2006 and I had my wife and 2 yo daughter with me. There was a Disney store there. I wouldn't have gone there with family members in the late 70s/ early 80s without at least two handguns on me.&&The chase in The French Connection is better than the entirety of most modern action movies.&&GL with a comment like that in this sub.  

I totally agree, though, after having just watched it.  It might have been intense for its time, but it was a guy essentially driving in a straight line, with a shitload of cuts.  

The fact that it's 'real,' doesn't make it better, you could make the same scene with a bunch of different shots, and you wouldn't have to put innocent people at risk to do it.

I mean, seriously, one of your detractors mentions that one of the problems with modern scenes in this vein, is that they have too many cuts, and this one has at least 2 dozen.&&Because they were married and had children, it was decided that it would be too risky for them to film certain dangerous shots.

(it's also why I'm glad for the use of cgi for certain special effects. does it sometimes look a bit more ""fake""? imo it does.

but I still prefer that over stuntmen and stuntwomen literally endangering their lives - and sometimes the lives of others - doing the most outrageous stunts just to film a product of entertainment

e.g. something like the Rick Sylvester stunts for the Bond films)&&I'm not defending him, and Friedkin has even admitted he would never pull these types of stunts again...but The French Connection is really that cool.

when it was released it was just called star wars&&I have the magazine that was written in. It also says to make Jaws, Steven Spielberg edited together footage of actual people being eaten by a great white shark. Word is it was much cheaper that way than to stage all the shark attacks depicted in the film. Thanks to this approach only 2 real actors were eaten by the shark in the film by the time it was completed, which at the time was hailed as a monumental achievement in workplace safety.&&You might be thinking of Apollo 13 which was filmed in free-fall.&&George Lucas had to sacrifice his first born to the Lizard People just so they'd look the other way while he blew up Alderaan&&I read it was filmed long ago, in a far away galaxy&&Gravity did it first....https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4117970&&Well, every movie is filmed in space&&Lucas originally wanted to make a WWII film called Desert War. 3 months into shooting the producer said he wanted science fiction so Lucas was forced to stop filming and go into post production for adding science fiction scenes. He added scenes with Peter Cushing and a few extras, and some plannned shots for the sequel Jungle War, but please don’t let these facts distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.&&Well everything they had on film did take up space.&&big (and empty) if true&&Wait, what?&&Don’t forget the horror of Zuzu’s petals&&It says the video is blocked in my Country, and I'm *French*&&Jesus Christ that was insane&&Just don’t mention Ghostrider, mainstream reddit is sometimes really anti-motorcycle.&&Oh yeah.

It's come high time for you to explain The Flintstones.&&I can't even fathom how he's making Ready Player One. &&No he went further than that.  You know all those Holocaust deniers?  Well, they are right.  They still have memories of the original time line.  For some reason, when a Spielberg-Undervair temporal unit is used, some retain memory of the unaltered timeline's events.  The rest of the world who accepts the revisions think they are crazy.


Spielberg was persecuted as a child by a German boy at school.  He was relentless in torturing poor little Spielberg.  Spielberg vowed to have his revenge.  He used his father's temporal unit and went back in time, convincing all Jews to financially decimate the Germans.  He gave the Jews information on financial markets and other world events to build their fortunes.  But the grandfather of the boy who tortured Spielberg was one of the few that retain original timeline information.  His rage and anger grew at the temporal changes he saw taking place.  At first people ignored this foaming at the mouth madman.  But then they started listening.  


To Spielberg's horror he saw what was unfolding and decided he had to film the events as a warning to never use a Spielberg-Undervair temporal unit again.  This is why Schindler's list is black and white.  It is the level of camera tech Spielberg had access to.


Schindler's list is Spielberg's warning to the world of trying to revise history to your gain.&&>  To Live And Die In L.A

Great movie.&&Is that Grissom?&&The Seven-Ups is also worth a look [at least for the car chase alone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vACWV5sRcY) (Thank Bill Hickman) It had pretty much the same crew minus Friedkin.

I'm pretty damn interested in the reason behind that.&&That was way better than the one in The French Connection.&&What about Bullitt?&&The BBC liked to use where I used to live to film because it's near London but can double for a small village in the countryside. They did some shots of car chases not too far away and apparently a lot of it was camera work but could be because they couldn't risk the cars. 

I think the project got cancelled though because no one knew were the footage showed up and usually they let people know afterwards. We got a few letter in to tell us what would happen at what times to not get in the shots or call the police etc.&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&How hungry you must have been!&&>**When** Gene Hackman didn’t just get nominated for *The French Connection*. He won. 

Like that?&&OTISBURG?!&&[deleted]&&We shoot NYC in LA once in a while cause of the obvious expense of going out there.

They have footage of the old Gumball and that scene is incredibly accurate minus the cops.&&Same with ""Bullit"" in SF. The streets seemed so empty back then. &&Well he died filming the 2nd one, so you can see how that worked out for him.

He was a shit driver honestly, I’m glad the film exists but there’s very little of it that’s impressive from a driving standpoint by Halicki.&&And yes, that’s a 42 minute car chase across 1974 los Angeles. It’s historically interesting too.

I've lived in Long Beach my whole life, and it was awesome to see so many familiar sights! It's crazy that even though so much is different, so much is still exactly the same. &&Why is the video quality better than most smartphones&&Lord have mercy&&But ""All hail SAG"" doesn't work.

Too much reality kills the joke.&&The really ironic part is that using the real thing is actually less authentic than using a prop. The reason old guitars sound the way they do is that over time the body pieces fuse together to make a really distinct sound. I.e. The artifact wouldn't have sounded like that during the time period it was supposed to be in the movie. &&What happened?&&Yeah, I'm a huge Tarantino fan but that was such a douche move. A museum let them borrow it and he went out of his way to have it smashed. Why, dude? Just swap it out with a prop for that one shot. &&yes, but it's still ridiculous. I mean, it's just a freaking movie. nobody should almost be dying (and in some cases: not just ""almost"") for it.

&&so am I supposed to bring out my pitchfork or not?&&I thought Hackman did the driving himself? Am I thinking of a different actor/film?&&Not sure that makes him a madman or a purist. Can I get a James Cameron up in here? Woot woot!

But one thing still irks me after all these years: ""color timing""? Is that something like 12 parsecs being a distance instead of a length of time?

And let's face it, if you could warp space enough to bring the Kessel Run down under 12 length units of anything, you'd definitely be fastest.&&I'm actually watching that right now on modbro... deja vu&&Well thats quite harsh :/&&Fair enough.

The police turned up to the premiere and arrested the director. He successfully argued that there was no evidence he was driving, and the crew all remained silent.

The police were soo furious they petitioned for the film to be banned.

&&Yeah, the sound is from a Ferrari while they drove a normal Mercedes road car.

He might have wanted a genuine reaction that doesn't fit than an appropriate reaction to a guitar being destroyed.  Having said that, I despised that moment myself and I'm sure he chose to manipulate his actors and destroy a historical artifact because it got his rocks off, would capture headlines and because he's a giant asshole.  A talented asshole.

Edit: Yea, I should clarify: there are rumours that Quentin wanted that, spurred by the fact he kept the shot in the final film, but that's all they are as far as anyone knows, rumours.  However it would not surprise me to find out Quentin orchestrated it.  But as far as anyone knows, there was a plan to switch it and due to carelessness it never got switched, and Kurt Russel thought it did.&&whoa that is so true, didn't think about that!&&[This](http://mashable.com/2016/02/05/quentin-tarantino-guitar/#rGuad_kbZqq3)

&&Hackman did do a good portion of the driving, but a stunt driver took over when the script demanded driving at 70mph or that little jump near the baby carriage.

His only solo game there was a failure. Metal Gear, ""his"" claim to fame, was actually a project he inherited from a senior. 

Now you can defend what he did with the franchise and all subsequent titles all you want, but creating ""good"" work doesn't make him not an asshole. He would lie constantly about the budgets for his game and then when he expended all the funds Konami gave him would ask for more knowing he'd receive it due to sunk costs. The end result was that despite his titles popularity they barely turned a profit because he would spend enormous amounts of money on the weirdest shit. To boot he was incredibly stand-offish and confrontational with pretty much everyone in the company, including employees in his department and under him. He even outright refused to pay one of the English voice actors for the game. Konami finally had enough and let him go, which caused ignorant fanboys everywhere to lash out against the company. 

I remember when the outrage against Konami first happened I didn't understand, it being unfamiliar with both the company and Kojima, so I spent some time researching it. For a while I had a much better argument against him laid out with links and resources to verify everything I've said. I'll try and find it because boy do I hate that asshole and what a dick he is/was to the people who raised him up from nothing. 

He does not deserve the praise and love he gets. 

**Edit**: From a previous post:

[Here](https://youtu.be/l1Dtr6SuKB0?t=6307) a video where they talk about the issue a bit. It starts out an 1:45:00

[Here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/06/02/understanding-what-has-really-happened-at-konami/#1f523d131b5f) is a pretty unbiased article from Forbes that focus on the high production cost and low return of Kojima's titles.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODkjJWe4su8) is an interview where they talk about his origins within the company. He had a difficult time finding a job before Konami hired him and he did a few games for them before he inherited the Metal Gear Solid title from another developer.

In the first link provided I believe it's one of the sound artist who talks about his ego being problematic for development and quite a few other people who have worked with him say similar things. Combine that with how he plasters his name all over the games in numerous credit sequences between missions it's not hard to see just how high on himself the guy is. 


&&The analogy doesn't hold, a better one would be fly Los Angeles - Moscow in 100s of kilometers less by going across the north pole, a flight path that gives little room for error. And from their reaction I think it also fits, they seem reinforced in the idea that he is reckless, something a stunt like that would very much prove him to be and it also fits his smuggler MO. 

Anyway, we're talking this farther than it holds so to speak :) It's fun discussing though!&&",2017-12-17 17:39:45

Many people say it can't be understood. They are wrong. There is a clear story hidden there.

Here is an explanation that I wrote several months ago.

#This is all SPOILERS for Mulholland Drive

----

I saw it because it was highly rated. I realized I was totally lost near the end, and started looking up explanations. I saw a few that were garbage, but then a couple that were onto something. Finally, I found a website with a huge analysis. I think it may have been [this one.](http://www.mulholland-drive.net/analysis/analysis01.htm)

I'll try to give a summary of it, because it's huge, but I haven't seen it in many years, so I might mess up a bit.

----

First, you need to understand that most of the movie is a dream, and that's what makes the movie so great. You have this story about a woman named Diane that you will mostly understand through dream analysis. There's no clear demarcation of present day, dream, or flashbacks, which makes the movie (deliberately) confusing.

Diane came to Hollywood to be an actress, but she didn't get anywhere, and is presently working as a waitress. The movie starts off with her having just switched apartments because she is trying to hide from detectives who are investigating a murder. The victim was an up and coming actress, Camilla. This was Diane's best friend and lover. Diane was in love with her, and she had naively believed that the feeling was mutual. But she feels abandoned when Camilla begins spending a lot of time with a man.

Mulholland Drive is the focal point of the story because Camilla invites Diane to an event there. Diane thinks that she is finally getting back together with her love, but instead, it turns out that this is her worst nightmare: Camilla is getting engaged. We can see that Diane is shy, lonely, and weak. She feels out of place, and she suspects that a new, similar looking girl at the party, has replaced her in Camilla's life as a female lover. This leads to Diane becoming self destructive, and hiring a hitman to murder Camilla. She soon regrets this, and hates herself and what she has done. We learn most of this through a flashback later in the movie.

At the start of the movie, we see Diane drop into her bed. That's when the dream starts. Diane is now ""Betty"". Betty is the alternate life that Diane wishes she had—her fantasy. So, by analyzing everything that happens to Betty, we can determine what things went wrong in Diane's life.

* Betty arrives in Los Angeles in a limo. So, Diane's arrival was likely far less glamorous.

* Betty has two older people with her who are quiet and smiling. So, maybe we can assume that Diane was raised by people who were perhaps always bickering and unsupportive, and loud. Their age implies that perhaps she was raised by her grandparents, suggesting that her parents were fuck-ups. i.e. not a good upbringing.

* Betty is staying at her aunt's beautiful condo. In reality, Diane is working as a waitress (and prostitute) to pay bills, and likely started off in a rough part of town.

* Betty is loved by everyone in the industry and it appears she will go far. Ultimately, things fall apart because of some evil-looking conspiracy against her by the elite of Hollywood. This is what Diane wants to believe. She doesn't want to accept that she wasn't good enough to be successful. It must have been a conspiracy against her!

* Rita is Camilla's dream-equivalent. She is about to be assassinated in a limo on Mulholland Drive, but she is saved by a serious car collision, though it leaves her with amnesia. In real life, Diane was brought to a house on Mulholland Drive in a limo, to an event which was, in a sense, a traumatic collision. (This is what's great about the movie. The relationships between dream and reality.)

* Rita is confused, weak, scared, and in need of help. Betty is shiny, pure, beautiful, and in a position to help. In reality, the situation was reversed. Diane was the weak one that latched onto Camilla.

* A new hitman is searching for Rita in the dream. He is a bumbling idiot. This is because Diane regrets hiring the hitman, and is hoping that he fails in assassinating Camilla. This manifests in her dream as incompetent hitmen.

* The restaurant has a psychic who is killed by something horrible he sees. We see later in the movie that Diane (recklessly) meets her hitman at her work. She speaks too loudly, and a restaurant patron (the psychic) appears to hear what she is saying. This manifests in the dream as a ""psychic"" because ""he knows"". The shock on the patron's face when he realizes what he is hearing is mirrored by the shock that kills the psychic.

* The restaurant has a horrible monster behind it. In reality, Diane's hitman tells her that they won't meet again, but he will place a blue key near the dumpster behind the restaurant to indicate that he has finished the job. We see this key on Diane's table in her apartment (indicating that Camilla has been assassinated). In her dream, (this one is interesting) the key is manifested as the blue box (because what else would a blue key open?), and the act of the assassination is manifested as the monster.

In the dream, Betty hides the box away when she finds it. She is afraid of it. It represent reality. Ultimately, she comes back to it, and opening it collapses the dream, ending the fantasy. She accepts that she has killed the woman she loves, and that the police are close to finding her, so she kills herself. Just before she dies, we once again the see the old couple. Now they are nagging her, perhaps telling her that she is worthless and will never amount to anything, which is her last thought before dying.

There are many other things that show up throughout the movie that have meaning. Some subtle. For example, Diane sits waiting by a phone next to a lamp with a red shade and we see an odd scene with a man answering a phone in an odd manner. This is supposedly how call-girls used to operate. This is supposed to tell us that she was working as a prostitute. I believe it's implied that Camilla got her into the business. 

It is true that there is *some* interpretation to be made. That's the beauty of it. Your mind will fill in the blanks as you interpret the dream. But the basic story is clear. There are key points that happened. Everything outside of the dream sequence happened. You just get to interpret what the elements of the dream represent, and (for me anyway) it creates a very powerful story. You can feel all of Diane's life-story through the inverse of her fantasy.

I don't think there's ever been any movie like it.

I was blown away by everything, but perhaps by Lynch's sound design most of all.  I can still _feel_ the sound of that final shot in my spine. &&I've often wondered if filmmakers can decide to make their movies have a bigger dynamic range, and make the max volume higher, to make gun shots and other loud elements relatively louder&&I wonder if that has anything to do with how his character in Twin Peaks featured that hearing problem...&&Homeless man scene with loud audio = loud.&&Yes! I watched Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me in a theatre an when they had the [Pink Room](#spoiler) scene. I felt like the sound was coming at me from all sides. It was so loud and disorienting! It was incredible as an audience member to feel my hearing senses getting flooded by sound while trying to listen to the bits of dialogue and have my visual senses be blasted by light and fog. It was so immersive and moving.&&I don't know how I would react if some one asked me to make the audio 3dB louder. That shit is expensive and tuned.

I work with DJs and everyone wants to be louder than than the previous one. And it baffles me that they don't know the basic concept of audio clipping, when all the meters are in the red all the time.&&[deleted]&&Lol that's hilarious. I remember waking up the next morning still thinking about it and finally decided that it must be a great movie if it had fucked with me on that kind of level.

Then my dad came down and was like ""I have decided that movie we watched yesterday was excellent"". He was doing the exact same thing as me.&&I understand some screenings had a leaflet explaining things to pay attention to. My DVD copy had the same. 

Did you get one of those?&&You have to admire plain-faced honesty. &&[SPOILER, of sorts]

I was the same way, then read an analysis (after watching the film) about how the first half (3/4?) were the irrational dreams of Naomi Watts’ character, kind of like a Wizard of Oz, where all the characters were someone else.  That helped a bit.

The one other thing I noticed after watching again was the incredible way Lynch dials up the sexiness of the two actresses throughout the film. It’s subtle, but by the theater scene they look nothing like their first appearance.

And the diner scene. Still the creepiest daytime scene ever.&&I have never see Mulholland Drive.

Should I?

I already have a hard time understanding people in loud environments, and they sing every word of dialog in that play as though it were an opera. There's even a scene where three people are simultaneously singing different words, and I totally gave up trying to understand.

As soon as the lights came on for intermission, I turned to her and was like ""who the heck were the two people on the roof?!"" Turns out they were the main female character and the main villain.

This guy directed a bunch of movies with some gimmicks that would be added in theaters that played his movies.  For house on haunted hill he wanted a skeleton to pop up from behind the screen to coincide with the skeleton in House on Haunted Hill.  For 13 Ghosts he gave the audience these glasses which enabled you to see the ghosts in the movie and if you got too scared you could take them off.  There was another movie too where he had a ""Doctor"" on standby in case people suffered a medical emergency from being too terrified of his films.&&I am a projection booth manager. A lot of movie distributors send info like this for their films. Disney does it in particular for most every movie they make.

“DONT FUCK THIS UP.”&&Nice cover letter. So what were the instructions?&&It's very hard to read the text, could you please get a better picture or paste the text? &&But where are the actual instructions?&&I went to see this film when I was 15 with no idea who David Lynch was or what the film was about. It was an intense experience. The   girl I was with who was a Lynch fan wasn't happy and called it a lipstick lesbian fantasy, I wasn't bothered by that aspect one bit. 

I most distinctly remember the 'turn the corner into the back alley' scene, an amazing subversion of jumpscare horror. 

That and Pan's Labyrinth were my two favourite cinema experiences. &&I'm sure it is screened from time to time in most big cities. There is a wealth of underground cinemas that play old movies that are culturally relevant if you know where to look.&&because of the all caps i read it like his character in Twin Peaks lol&&Not just in his voice, but YELLING in his voice.&&I TOLD THEM TO FIX THEIR HEADROOM OR DIE&&It kind of adds to his creepiness in a way. He is so friendly it’s surreal. &&I’ve read a lot of breakdowns of Mulholland Drive.

That was the absolute best one, by a long shot.&&Yeah I don't get the people claiming that the movie was not meant to make sense. If you're told after the movie what happened and why it happened, it makes perfect logical sense. Despite that, some people just don't want to believe that it was intended that way.&&This is a fantastic summary, but you forgot a crucial aspect of the movie. Every scene and sequence is a parody of a common Hollywood trope or cliche. 

The movie is ultimately Lynch’s commentary on the film industry. For example, the hitman scene is a satirical depiction of Tarantino’s style of blunt and unabashed violence, parodical in the absurdity of the bloodshed. This is manifested in the camera style, unlike any other part of the movie. Betty as the youthful Hollywood cadet is a satire of the innocent young actress trope; this quickly leads into the following Nancy Hardy partner detectives cliche with Rita. 

There are more that I won’t go into, such as the horror genre subversion and others. The movie is exceptional because it not only tells the complicated story that the thread starter mentioned, but also encapsulates Lynch’s critiques of Hollywood.&&Now do lost highway.&&Thx for this. Lynch really is an amazing artist. &&That is what i like about Lynch's films, they are like windows into minds where the lines between dreams and reality are blurred. Lost highway is my favorite of his films.&&Unpopular opinion warning:

So a few months ago, I watched MD, and understood the broad strokes of it, and thought it was kind of cheap and overly complex for complexity's sake. I just found in pretentious because Lynch clearly thought he was being super deep,  but the story within the complexity is really basic and there were a thousand better ways to tell it.

I read a long, multi-page explanation of the finer points and I watched the movie again, only realizing that I hated it even more. 

In my defense:

I realized that my feelings about the movie versus others is just about aspects that I desire from storytelling.

David Lynch is a great filmmaker, and MD is an extremely impressive movie because its complexity is airtight, probably not a single line is wasted or contradictory, and Lynch fans love that skill that he has.

I just hate that style of storytelling where everything is purposely obscured from the viewer, not as a mystery to be solved, but purposely to be confusing. I don't think the audience should be spoonfed, but Lynch has a style that wants his audience to walk away confused, or feeling uncomfortable at the very least.

The impressive thing about this is that it's not all nonsense. He knows exactly what story he's telling. My problem is just that he tries his hardest to keep that story from his audience, which in my perspective, is not good storytelling.

Fans aren't wrong to enjoy it. He's extremely impressive at what he does. It's just not a style I enjoy.&&[Let the man himself tell you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKiIroiCvZ0)&&#GET REAL&&That's such a sadness.&&THE ALL-CAPS CERTAINLY HELPS, FRIEND.&&I saw Justice League opening weekend and it was dangerously loud to start. I had to sit through the trailers with my hands over my ears because it  painful.   Luckily the parade of people complaining got them to turn it down.&&NO, I DON'T DRIVE A ROLLS ROYCE.&&Lynch? Hard of hearing?[ Nah...](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53f91163e4b0a085e8d24e89/53ff4d37e4b079d3f1874449/569d14de8b38d4c31b2a644c/1453302094724/?format=1000w)&&His stuff is both way too quiet and way too loud in my experience. Forget trying to watch it if anyone in the house is sleeping. You either have no idea what was said in one scene, or the person sleeping wakes up hearing ""BABY WANTS TO FUCK!"" in another scene. &&One of the few directors that I actually enjoy being shoved in movies/TV, because he usually treats himself like shit in hilarious ways.

Him and Peter Jackson, who is always some sort of hobo or insane person.&&[deleted]&&What'd you think of the ending?&&I look for horror. I always try to find the most frightening music, movies, and video games and the last 5 seconds of season 3 honestly shook me.

I thought the entire final episode was brilliant after a day of reflecting.&&Oh god that scream at the end.&&> I can still feel the sound of that final shot in my spine.

Word. I've heard a thousand screams in films and TV over the duration of my lifetime, and the only 2 that have made the hair stand up on my neck have been from Laura Palmer.&&Am I the only one who wants *less* dynamic range? I'd like to be able to hear low dialog clearly without having my ears blown out during action sequences.&&That’s basically what David Lynch did here.  The average levels of the sound recording are lower than typical.  He’s asking the projectionist to boost the levels, so things like dialog are the usual volume and the loudest sounds will be that much louder.&&Movie theatres are calibrated to a specific sound level (when everything is as it is supposed to be), so the max level is something you generally cannot do anything with for normal screenings. I suppose you could send a note to the projectionist, but not being Lynch, movies being digital, and projectionists going out of style I wouldn't expect too much. However the standard levels that exist should be more than enough for most of us, and most certainly loud enough to get people complaining about it. Experimenting with loudness, perceived loudness, and contrasts is something that is very much a part of the sound designer's toolbox.&&In Dunkirk every time a gunshot went off, I thought I had been shot.&&Maybe the scariest jump scare ever, even though you have every reason to expect it. &&I've used dB math for things like radio/EM waves. Is it the same thing in sound? So the 3 dB increase he's asking for here is double the normal volume?&&I think David Lynch has been quoted as saying that you shouldn’t be able to talk about a movie after you watch it – it should just be the feeling you get afterwards that determines whether you like it or not&&I think David Lynch is perhaps the modern master of telling a story with a coherent enough **plot** to keep you interested enough to keep watching, but without any trace of an intelligible **story**. 

In other words, the sequence of events that unfold are engaging, interesting, and visually compelling. But the details of **why** those events took place, and **how** are intentionally absent. 

It's like the movie version of a Jackson Pollock painting or an Allen Ginsburg poem. &&Yeah we watched this movie for a weekly class in college. The week after we were supposed to discuss Lost Highway, but none of us felt like we had discussed Mulholland enough to move on. Really a good thinker of a movie, easily my favorite Lynch's movies.&&Roger Ebert had a cogent explanation. I think you can find it online.&&I hope that your dad announces what he thinks of every movie that way haha&&Towards the beginning the Naomi Watts 'Betty' character is showing 'Rita' around the apartment and says its her aunts and that she just does two commercials a year to pay for it and spends most of her time travelling.  At that point i knew everything the Betty char said was a lie.  It helped me understand the rest of the movie much better.  Somebody should start a thread about foreshadowing in movies.  There is a lot and its not well documented.  Also its not really a spoiler because it happens early in the film.&&I’ve had those feelings recently with his magnum opus, Twin Peaks: The Return. An 18 hour masterpiece that is beautifully, frustratingly bizarre and wonderful.

Some of the clues are just fluff.&&Lynch is heavily influenced by the Wizard of Oz.

It is interesting reading some of the bad reviews, though. Many critics claimed it was just Lynch attacking the movie industry because he's not popular. So, Lynch made a character who was a bad actress that believed there was a Hollywood conspiracy against her, and those critics were so lost in the movie that they thought that was Lynch complaining about a Hollywood conspiracy against him.

&&It's been a while, but I'll do it.

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!:

Lost highway is best views as 3 different parts.  2 of the 3 parts are not real.  So let's start with the part that is real... 

The second part: reality

We suddenly find Fred (the wife killer) in an interrogation room talking to the cops saying that he killed his wife.  This is the only part that's real.  Fred coming to term with what he actually did and him going to jail.  This part is short in the movie, so it'll be short here.  Now let's delve into the events leading up to this realization.

The first part: recollection 

The events leading up to the realization that he killed his wife is him recalling the events leading up to the murder of his wife.  The movie starts with the mysterious message ""Dick Laurant is dead"".  I'm on the fence on this one.  I believe Fred murdered Dick an doesn't realize he did it. Most of this part deals with Fred denying his actions and making up fake events in his mind to hide his actions from himself.  He and his wife receive a set of video tapes of somebody going through the house.  This represents the truth/reality.  This is something that his subconscious is trying to force him to come to terms with.  This is him going through the house.

He and his wife go to a part where the meet the “Mystery Man” (MM) for the first time.  He does a trick where he calls Fred’s house and the MM answers.  He represents the actions that Fred is going to do later.  Murder his wife.

The next day Fred gets another video showing his wife’s mutilated body.  This is the moment he snaps into reality and realizes the he’s the one that murdered her.  The videos forced him to face reality and he’s sentenced to murder.

A few details about this part.  

* There isn’t much detail in any of the scenes.  All the settings are minimal.  It’s like a person trying to remember something, they remember what’s important, not the little details.
* The videos were black and white.  This wasn’t stylistic, they represent surveillance videos.  Surveillance videos capture real events.
* We learn that Fred plays jazz, this will come up later.

The third part: (Fugue state)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state]
>Dissociative fugue, formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder.[1] It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality.

In his prison cell, Fred goes through a transformation where he turns into Pete a young auto mechanic. 
Pete is release and we notice some major changes.  The details of the scenes are more complete.  We have logos, brand names, music in the background, art.  Fred has created a completely new (believable) reality for himself. 

Pete is a great kid, smart, handsome, great at his job, caring parents and girlfriend.  Everybody loves him, including the gangster customer (Mr. Eddy) who will only trust Pete with his car.  Pete has a great life and is loved by all.

Pete meets Alice, Mr. Eddy’s girlfriend who looks just like his murdered wife.  He is immediately smitten by her and they start to have an affair.  This is his real life sneaking into his fantasy life.  This is where it all starts to fall apart.  Alice is really his wife “Renee”, and represents her in the fantasy.  
There’s a lot of symbolism that I can’t remember (it’s been years) but here are the key points in this part of the movie.
His past/reality keeps trying to sneak in.  

* At the garage, jazz music is playing and it bothers him so much that he has to turn it off.  
* He keeps having flashes of light and headaches.  These are usually triggered by something unpleasant, like the feeling of rejection

Then the finale where he and Alice/Renee have sex in the desert.  During this scene he says over and over “I want you”, at the end she says “you’ll never have me”

He stands up and he’s Fred again.  Her ultimate rejection forces his mind to go back to Fred.  Then we encounter the mystery man again.  Once again, he represents truth.  He tells Fred that Alice is really Renee, then asks Fred what his name is.  He’s forcing Fred to deal with the truth and starts chasing him with a surveillance camera that’s been rigged to work as a camcorder.  Again, surveillance camera is here to represent reality.

Fred runs away from reality, both literally and figuratively.  He jumps in the car and starts driving trying to get away from the truth.



&&Lost Highway is actually super similar to Mulholland Drive, almost as if they're companion pieces. Fred and Pete are a personality split. Fred can't get it up, Pete fucks everyone, etc. Fred only realizes the personality split too late after he kills his wife. The last scene kinda ties it all together with the morphing face of Fred driving away. There's a lot more details but I'm on my phone right now, but that's kinda the gist of what I got out of it.  Also if you wanna go into psychoanalysis, Lynch fuckin loves that shit and it all fits super well with characters falling into the places of Anal Father, Phallic Mother, the personality splits n all. Mulholland Drive works too. &&What are the odds, almost seems clairvoyantly staged by you three. Are you tipping a hat to the movie here?&&That's how I feel watching Interstellar in 720p&&WHAT WAS THAT COOPER?!&&I pictured him screaming this announcement at the projectionist. &&MODUS OPERANDI&&WHAT THE HELL?&&Sounds like he likes having a high dynamic range in his films. If he cranked the theatre sound by an extra 3db, perhaps the whole film was mixed 3db quieter than normal (so most of the time it sounded the same) but he's given himself an extra bit of headroom to play with for loud moments.&&Bro put this on his twitter. &&*otherworldly whooshing intensifies*&&This right here is what I love about David Lynch.&&Oh weird. Did it sound like your ear became a broken speaker? I've had that since I was young.&&I’m not the guy but I fucking loved it&&Perfectly, transcendently tragic. It wasn't quite the same crescendo as the last few episodes of Season 2, but it was all the more haunting for it. Seeing Coop possessed was bad, but seeing him truly _lost_ was worse.   

There were a few aspects of Season 3 — Audrey's bit, in particular — where you really feel Lynch toying with your desire to understand. And he just pulls that understanding away from you in an excruciating way. I loved every second.    &&“What year is this?”

The way Cooper says this and the scream. So unsettling. &&As someone who lives in an apt, I’m with you. Normal tv has gotten a lot better about loud ads, but streaming sites are awful (looking at you CW app ~_~). Movies are hit or miss on whether I’m going to blast my neighbors when action sequences start.&&It’s all in the execution. The *Transformers* films do sound like so much metallic white noise, of course. Alternatively, playing the *Mass Effect* trilogy on home theater audio mode, there is plenty of weapons fire, all of which sails under the dB reserved for Reapers.

Well, it’s not **all** in the execution. Properly calibrated audio systems treat dynamic range better than TV speakers or cheap sound bars, and you can always boost the center channel. &&For the theater mix I want as much dynamic range as possible to make use of the nice sound system. For the home mix then yeah, I want to hear the dialogue without waking up the neighbors. &&Same. Love the show, but hate having to babysit the volume.&&It's double the power, but since hearing is non linear it's not double the perceived volume, that takes around 10dB increase.
&&Reminds me of Roger Evert's review of *The Grey*

[After ""The Grey"" was over, I watched the second film for 30 minutes and then got up and walked out of the theater. It was the first time I've ever walked out of a film because of the previous film. The way I was feeling in my gut, it just wouldn't have been fair to the next film.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/the-grey-2012)&&[deleted]&&Like with *The Road*.

*The Road* is one of the few movies I have seen in my life where I just didn't... want to talk about it afterwards. I know it's ""just a movie"" or whatever, but goddamn. Very few times has any kind of art ever made me *feel* something.

For those rare few of you that don't know -- *The Road* is about the most realistic depiction of how the world would operate in a GlobalCatastrophe scenario. The post-apocalypse movie-scenario. It was a bit too realistic.

Seriously, it made me rethink things, about how society is and how it would be if it ever just broke down again. You do not want that to happen, trust me. It would not be fun.

edit: I just want to add -- *The Road* is one of a handful of movies that I consider ""great"" but I do not and will not ever watch them again. It's not that it is *that* impactful, it's just that it's not something I really want to think about again. I think a lot of people feel that way about *Schindler's List*. Great film, important film, but not something you just pop in the ole blu ray player while you're making dinner.&&[deleted]&&Mother! may be the exception to that..&&When I saw Grand Budapest Hotel for the first time it just sort of stuck in my brain. There was this feeling.. I still feel it just thinking about the film. I can totally understand what he means by this.&&Agreed.  I walked out of There Will be Blood in disgust.  The next few days I couldn't stop thinking about it and now it's on my top 5.  I like movies that stick with you like that.&&That's the exact feeling I got while watching Twin Peaks.  &&[deleted]&&I'm nitpicking here, but *italics* show emphasis, bolding shows **volume**&&[removed]&&>This is a movie to surrender yourself to. If you require logic, see something else. ""Mulholland Drive"" works directly on the emotions, like music. Individual scenes play well by themselves, as they do in dreams, but they don't connect in a way that makes sense--again, like dreams. The way you know the movie is over is that it ends. And then you tell a friend, ""I saw the weirdest movie last night."" Just like you tell them you had the weirdest dream.

[Full review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mulholland-drive-2001)&&I don't think ""lie"" is the right word here, as it's more what she thought or dreamed it would be like, she's lying to herself first and foremost... but yeah, well spotted, I sure missed that.&&I'm confused at how you knew that it was a lie in that scene? Could you please explain?&&It's sort of a spoiler, though, because now I'm going to watch it with that in mind and not trust anything her character says.  &&This was included in the original DVD:

http://www.timebetweenthenotes.com/img/images_md2001/clues.jpg

I recall seeing it in newspaper ads for the film and I’ve heard that leaflets were placed on the seats at some screenings.

The DVD is also notable for having most of the controls locked out. There are no chapter stops and the film can’t be fast forwarded. &&Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who thought it was terrible and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

Nobody likes hearing about other people's dreams. I don't like people who talk about their dreams.

It's like when you're waking up and you're having this semi-lucid dream. And you're sure it's like the best, tightest plot ever and you're totally going to write a book that is this dream. And then you fully wake up and the dream was about Macho Man Randy Savage poisoning pancake mix and feeding it to Native Americans for unspecified reasons. Mulholland Drive is what happens if someone goes ahead and makes that movie. It's really well made but at its heart it is total nonsense.&&>  it's the lack of a linear storyline, and the fact the is devolves into (literally) a bizarre dream sequence, 

Have you only seen this movie once? It gets better with repeat viewings. The thing about this movie is that you have to realise that the first 80% of the movie is a dream. The last 20min is the ""real life"" . Naomi is a failed actress and is at the end of a failed relationship. She has a dream of how her life could have been different....better but then it starts to turn into a nightmare. 
When she wakes back up the first thing I notice is how most of the color is sucked out of the movies and how disheveled Naomi looks. You are hit in the face with reality while her real life unfolds in a stream of conscious. 

The movie IS fairly linear up until the last 20min where Naomi's life is revealed.  &&Highly recommend this article to help understand Mulholland Drive. The caps lock really helps. 

Edit: forgot the link like a nincompoop....
http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2012/03/04/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs-the-genius-of-mulholland-drive&&Oh, it's not all that hard to follow once you realize 2/3rds of the movie is a dream, including the very beginning. Honestly, the wikipedia entry for the film does a good job of summarizing the plot.&&Hello there &&I have never heard of this, but I was diagnosed this year with ADHD. A few seconds of googling has told me that CAPD and ADHD have a very high rate of comorbidity.&&If you understand a single bit of a David Lynch project, you've misunderstood the entire thing.&&Most of the movie is the main character's dream, some of the tangents in the film are some of the people in her dream having their own dreams. 

You can either say it is lower levels of her subconscious or make some kind of Jungian argument that they are other real people and there is a raw collective dream that they are all buying into... 

Which also describes LA and filmmaking in general in a lot of ways. &&http://www.lynchnet.com/angrydog/dog7.jpg&&There was a new season of Twin Peaks this year.&&I heard he hasn’t washed it in years.&&DEAR TWITTER FRIENDS&&It's like when he used to release the weather reports.  I remember thinking, ""Oh this should be interesting"", then, nope, [it's just him reporting the weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raF6k444MWs).  I think [this one was about as ""David Lynch"" as they got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD27a2iZFHE).

I really enjoyed his [Interview Project](http://interviewproject.davidlynch.com/www/).  I wish he'd continued that.&&He stayed at the hotel I worked room service at a few years ago. Everyday he'd order no food and 4 cappuccinos at 9am like clockwork. Other than that just a polite guy with a weird voice.&&Yeah I remember one was ""here's a picture of a chair I built today. What did you do on this fine Saturday?""&&I mean, is he wrong?&&I saw Inland Empire on my Ipod. and I'm not talking about the touch lol&&He's like grumpy Mr. Rogers&&[deleted]&&If I remember right, the first half is pretty much the pilot. ABC decided not to pick it up to series and instead of moving on, Lynch decided to go back to the drawing board and turn it into the movie.&&The original concept came from Mark Frost pitching the idea that they do a Twin Peaks spin-off about Audrey moving to LA in the early 90s. The idea stuck with Lynch and he retooled it into the basic setup of the movie about an actress taking in an amnesiac. They started filming it as a TV show before ABC passed on the project, then retooled it again into a feature film. There is a pilot cut out there somewhere that’s listed on IMDB, but I have no idea how to watch it. &&It was intended to be an Audrey-led spin-off of twin peaks. She's in the theater scene. &&What is a dowser and how does opening it affect picture fade-in?&&This is super cool. Any idea if projectionists followed this? I feel like in today's world it would be thrown out&&You’re probably kidding, but Kubrick is at the mercy of the labs on that one - technicolour and deluxe struck release prints that often had these kinds of stuff ups.&&Seriously, they didn't call him ""One Take"" Kubrick for nothing.   
He made Troma films look meticulous.&&Barry Lyndon is best Kubrick.&&[That sounds like a movie that would have a great poster, so I had to look it up.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/c9/b8/83c9b87780a1517f5e11feb62eb36ffe.jpg)&&Most of the time, my projectors will automatically adjust for the picture requests, but the sound requests are required to be done by hand. My theatre runs our sound at ~6.0dB, so for them you request a 7.0dB or higher, I have a hard time turning it up that loud. I know the director wants it a certain way, but the audience of your film is primarily old people or kids, then why would I turn it up and risk hurting their hearing. Especially when the most common complaint I get from people is, ""Can you turn it down? It's very loud.""&&The rating card is the MPAA rating card. It does go all the way at the end of the film. My theatre is in the US, and that is how it has always been. Makes more sense for it to go before the film imo. &&I can't explain it, but somehow knowing the English language lyrics to Crying, but having it sung in Spanish, added to the emotionality.&&Really appreciate you typing that out, thank you. &&>  called it a lipstick lesbian fantasy

She wasn't wrong.&&There's probably some Lynch fan who only likes Inland Empire too...&&""A lipstick lesbian is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a greater amount of feminine gender attributes relative to other gender expressions, such as wearing make-up (thus, lipstick), wearing dresses or skirts and having other characteristics associated with feminine women.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_lesbian

So I think the criticism is that she thought it appealed to the male fantasy rather than being an authentic lesbian romance tale.&&Mainly the lipstick&&""lipstick lesbian"" is a term for more feminine lesbians.&&Bruce Campbell actually seems like a dude who has embraced his celebrity for a single character in an amazing way. A way I wish Harrison Ford had. :-(&&His interviews are still so great though. He's such a strange character and everything he says is so interesting to me.

I see why you're confused. Without the other character's line, it's entirely indecipherable. Goes like this: 

Man:""Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!"" 

Woman:""Mommy loves you.""  

Man:""BABY WANTS TO FUCK! GET READY TO FUCK YOU FUCKER'S FUCKER! Uuuh uuuh oooh. DON'T YOU FUCKING LOOK AT ME!""&&Too many characters&&That he's able to catalyze medical diagnoses through his media?&&[deleted]&&I am the guy and I fucking loved it too.&&It’s the saddest thing I have ever seen in TV. 

My favorite character of all time was in a stupor for 16 TV hours. He finally pulls through, only to get lost in time and space because of a cosmic miscalculation. The bad guys win (?). 

I fucking loved it lol my jaw was on the floor for an hour. &&Exactly. I was alone and in complete darkness when I  watched it.When the episode jumped to black after the scream I stood up and just thought for 10 minutes. The somber credits at the end were absolutely perfect.

Edit: that coupled with the recognizable call of ""laura"" from the pilot episode gave me chills. Then the lights in that reality burned out... Oof.&&I hate having to sit with the remote in hand and police the volume constantly if I'm watching a film late at night. &&Well, now I want to replay Mass Effect to experience the Reaper sounds again.&&The grey was one of the first movies my father and I watched together upon learning he had terminal lung cancer thatd metastasized throughout his body to the liver, spine, pelvis, femur and that he had it in his best interest to get his affairs in order immediately. Holy fuck, is what i think we said after. I think we even watched it sitting in his bed together.&&Never before have I been so thoroughly surprised by a movie as with The Grey. 

It was so poorly marketed that I went in expecting Liam Neeson to punch some wolves to death and instead I got a haunting meditation on death and how we come to terms with it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Even now years later I remember each character death and how I felt. The plane crash, the snowstorm kill, the fall, the fire fight, the riverbank, the drowning. 

The shot of the one character from behind, he’s accepted death and he’s just watching the mountains and waiting. The whole shot is a slow zoom, nearly silent. Finally just as the viewer nears the back of the characters head, you hear a split second of the wolves panting and it smash cuts away. 

The acceptance of death and our fate as influenced by our lives and experiences. Shocking, beautiful, sobering, horrific, and surprisingly deep. A+&&Sounds like Lynch to me.&&The movie paled in comparison to the book.  I know this is /r/movies, but has to be said.&&Totally agree with you. There’s no way I could watch that move again. Even now after seeing it almost a year ago I can still remember how it left me feeling and I don’t want to feel that way. It also made me think if this is how the world ends I really don’t want to live through that kind of horror. &&Requiem for a dream fits that classification for me. It had a profound effect on me, but is definitely not something I want to experience again. The character arc of the mom as well as the final consequences for each of the three friends was a bit too much for me to handle. I will be able to carry the vividness of that experience through my life with one view thank you.&&>For those rare few of you that don't know -- The Road is about the most realistic depiction of how the world would operate in a GlobalCatastrophe scenario. The post-apocalypse movie-scenario. It was a bit too realistic

I would put ""It Comes at Night"" in that same category. It's not quite as brutal or unrelenting as ""The Road"" but it also doesn't pull any punches.

Riley Keough deserves an oscar for [that scream at the end of the film when her son gets shot](#spoiler). I'm a paramedic and I've heard that sound from someone for real... and she fucking nailed it.

It's one of the only films/performances that actually made me think about leaving the theater because I wasn't sure if couldn't handle it.&&Weirdly, I felt that way *reading* the Hunger Games, but the movies left me cold.  

And as a kid, the scariest movie I ever saw was a sci-fi non-horror movie:  Gattica.  I have asthma and other health issues and I realized I would be culled.&&Requiem for a dream had the exact same effect on me. Would not watch again but damn is it good.&&That feeling of awe and disgust mixed together, which you don’t care to ever experience again, is pretty much true of everything Cormac McCarthy has ever written.&&*Blindness* with Julianne Moore is similar, a realistic part of a pandemic scenario. Seeing it once is enough for a lifetime. &&Yeah...a friend of mine took a girl to see The Road on their first date, not knowing what the movie was about. Surprisingly, they did marry each other eventually. &&The road was great

Except for that kid&&There's even a whole edited book, by philosophers, about that movie. Its titled The Way of Nature and The Way of Grace&&Some of the best movies I've ever watched have defied my attempts to explain and categorize them. They just elicit such a strong emotional response that you can't help but like them. Some things don't need to be understood to be appreciated&&I think we could be friends.&&The tree of life got me too,  big time.&&With The Tree of Life it had more of a tangible impact on me because it reminded me so much of my childhood, so it wasn't as much about a particular je ne sais quoi. &&I saw Tree of Life at an open air screening on a rooftop. The movie was projected onto a fabric screen, that billowed slightly in the wind, adding another dimension to the visuals. From time to time, I would take my eyes off the screen to see the full moon, or a flock of birds flying past at some crucial juncture, or some other atmospheric. It was mesmerising.

Honestly, most of my friends thought the film was pretentuous. Maybe if I'd watched it on DVD in my living room, I'd agree. But viewing the movie in that setting completely transformed my experience of it. It was one of the few movies I've *felt*, rather than watched.

Edit: I can't spell. And I really shouldn't be awake&&Malick’s movies don’t work as movies. They’re more akin to poetry, as cheesy as that sounds, meant to evoke. He’s not my favorite, but I’ll never doubt his pure genius. &&Well especially with the Tree of Life. It's not David Lynch weird, if you're a movie person that doesn't not feel like you've wasted your life for 2 hours just ""Experiencing"" something, that's what it is.

The Tree of Life is extremely high quality technically, it's just supposed to be a visceral experience of living these people's lives, like you were just dropped in, with a handful of random narrations and overarching themes. &&I saw Tree of Life on a date. Cried during. I never saw or spoke to that girl again.&&I've always felt like Malick's movies are oddly similar to Lynch's - not in terms of content or style, but in the prioritization of emotional experience above all else. They both refuse to make movies that tell you *what* to think, but instead create a space where you can have your own personal reaction and feel things that defy the usual categorization of ""happy"" or ""sad"" and instead layer various emotional experiences atop one another - it's like sinking into a body of water and drifting in its eddies and currents.

Movies like that I'll probably analyze and pick apart eventually, but what's more important is that initial primal, emotional reaction.&&Oh my lord, I had such a sense of confusion and I didn’t know if I liked it. But 15min in the car ride home discussing it with friends, scream every revelation we sequentially had. I decided I loved the film after a discussion, and the many that came the next day &&Loved it myself. Clearly a very divisive movie though.&&The Return especially. Had no idea what was going on half the time, but I enjoyed the hell out of it. Might actually be my favorite TV season ever.&&Doubly so when watching The Return. I had no desire to dissect or deeply understand what was going on after because the damn thing had moved me on an emotional level so much.&&My plot is so strong they cant cancel me yet.&&I love that&&No sarcasm, that is super deep&&Though sometimes it can work better that way, to appreciate the later work all the more when it’s all fresh and isn’t retreading anything - and then looking at the earlier version in an academic way to see what the later film derived from. &&that really nails it and most of Lynch's movies&&God I miss him and his reviews.  Even the times I didn't agree with him, most of the time you had to respect his thoughts on a movie and how he expressed them.&&At the time I noticed it I just labelled it a lie.  When I'm watching a movie like that my mind is going down quite a few rabbit holes.  When i notice something I keep it simple, if its too complicated then I'll start missing new stuff that I need to be paying attention to.&&Because I've been to LA and a place as nice as the one she was in would go for big bucks.  and that somebody would only have to do 2 commericals a year to make so much money they could travel all the time is a joke.  Her aunt would have been an older woman and older women have a really hard time getting work in Hollywood. Anyone who makes money in hollywood has to hustle.  the whole line made me laugh. Also, movie scripts are based on short stories and a rule of short stories is everything in a short story is supposed to have a purpose in advancing the plot or it shouldn't be put in.   There was no real reason plot wise I should care how Betty got a great apartment, a rich uncle or sugar daddy could be paying for it, but for it to be a point of conversation means its significant in some way.  The fact that the story was so implausible made me suspect something was off with Betty.  Some writers, directors can put meaningless stuff in movies but it can make a movie tedious and boring really quick and they don't get away with it for long without professional critics giving them a hard time.  A David Lynch movie might have a lot of mood setting visuals and strange plot twists, but a straight up comment like that means something.  &&It isn't because that info is just a nudge. Lynch made her innocence and eagerness over the top to give you that same sense about her.&&its a different kind of spoiler.  Knowing that might makes you work harder while watching because you need to assess whats she's saying and try to figure out what parts she's lying about because she will tell some truth just to be convincing.  Knowing how the movie ends just makes you a non participant in the movie.  Also having some forshadowing pointed out to you will make you a better detective for it in future movies.&&I feel like I understand the movie pretty well but I don't get the meaning of most of these clues. In fact, my understanding of the film may have been decreased by reading this. Perhaps this was Lynch's intention.&&Thank you!&&Needs more jpeg&&LOL, I had one of those dreams the other day.  When I woke up, I was sure I had a solid script for the best, funniest action movie ever.  Then I started to write about it, and realized it was total shite.&&I often have this happening to me, and I think those dreams would make really great movies. Creativity is at its best when you're sleeping. The only problem is, by the time you get out of bed you've pretty much all forgotten it. Plus the filmmaking talent required to actually replicate the feel of those dreams would have to be immense.&&I like people talking about their dreams. So you're just wrong on that part :p

And it's never the story that is interesting when you dream, it's the feeling. That feeling you never felt in real life. And why not try to make it into a film ? There would be no other way to feel that feeling again. &&Hey great write up! That movie....I saw that while studying abroad in Australia, and I....just one of the few experience you have where you'd follow something artistic anywhere, you know? I was completely overwhelmed by it. 

Lynch is a master. I didn't 'understand' the movie the first time watching it, but I had absolutely no problem with that. I think the problem that people have with Lynch is that they compare him with someone like M Night Shyamalan. M Night's movies are often constructed deliberately as puzzles, designed explicitly to be solved/deconstructed/unraveled. 

I feel that Lynch's movies resolve no way upon a trick or conceit. The ""it was a dream"" aspect of Mulholland Drive or ""he's made a fake fantasy life for himself"" like in Lost Highway isn't the point, or the plot whatsoever. It's just the reality that is lived in. In other words, the movie itself reveals how the conceit is revealed. Not a character, not dialogue, not an actual element of screen action or dialogue. The entire movie itself is the 'thing' you have to examine to figure it out. I really don't think people get what a total master of the form Lynch is. &&[deleted]&&Reading this right now, and this paragraph made me chuckle because of how relevant it is to the crackpot fan theories I've seen about the *Song of Ice and Fire* series of books (Game of Thrones).

&&Wait a second...&&Essentially, everything from the main credits with the limo drive, up until the scene of Rita putting the wig on in the bathroom, is the two-part pilot. It runs almost exactly 90 minutes if I recall correctly, so it’s just about right for a two parter on TV.

The couple of opening scenes before the limo drive and everything after the wig scene is the additions to round it out as a film. If you’ve seen the film you’ll know this means the original story would have been quite different.

You can kind of tell that the actresses look slightly different between the wig scene and the next one when Betty goes to bed, and not in a normal continuity kind of way, but more like a “this is moments later in the movie but months later in the production” kind of sense. &&She's not in the theater scene. It's a Ronette Pulaski look-a-like sitting next to Laura Palmer look-a-like. &&Never heard about that yet I read a lot about this film. Is this a fan theory ?&&A dowser is the movie projector equivalent of a lens cap (though it's inside the projector right in front of the bulb, not over the lens). Close it and no light gets through.&&Shutter. Dowser is closed when you want 0 projector light going through the lens.&&... where are you getting that from? He looked for ""one take"" but only the one he wanted, if it took them doing a scene a dozen to 80 times he'd not move on to the next until he got exactly what he was looking for. I believe Matthew Modine lost his temper on the set of Full Metal Jacket and yelled out ""What the hell do you want from me?"" only to be told ""Better acting. A good take. Start again."" and so they did. &&Hah!  Nice find!  And it's got the guarantee!  xD

I like the theory that [Cooper 'won', but only by sacrificing himself, Diane, and Laura to **n o n e x i s t e n c e**. Diane had to fuck Cooper to lure Jouday into whatever dimension they drove to - because Cooper had raped her, the act created the negative energy to draw her to them. Then, Cooper tried to get Laura to meet Jouday - Laura being the being of white light when she took her face off, as opposed to Jouday's darkness - in the hopes that they would annihilate one another. Jouday isn't there in the house, though, because they're *inside* Jouday, in a way - that's why the ""Laaaaaauraaaa?"" seems to come from nowhere in particular. As soon as they realize they aren't where, or when, they need to be, their ""spirits"" naturally try to leave - via electricity, like Agent Jefferies in FWWM when he discovered what year it was. Jouday can't handle Laura's unbounded spirit, and it overloads her in the very last frame. Cooper is likely lost to the void created - callback to Season 1, when Donna says that Laura's death was sucking all of them into it like a black hole.](#spoiler) &&Jesus fuckin leg cancer

It was fantastic and I'm glad I watched it, I just don't feel like being put in the depths of despair again.&&JUST YOU WAIT FOR THE RESOURCE WARS, BOI!&&There really needs to be some kind of record for ""Movie with the most consistent review"" because 99.9% of the people I've seen comment on *Requiem for a Dream* say ""It's an incredible movie that everyone should watch. I'm never going to watch it again.""&&One of my favorite movies that i can’t watch. Watching Requiem always sounds like such a good idea! Woo amazing film with drugs and crazy effects! Ya! Then you get all the way thru and feel like your heart and your soul have been crushed, dragged, shredded, tortured. I had two firsts one night in early high school; first time watching Requiem, and first time trying Adderall. I was so laser-focused on each and every moment of those 102 minutes, i wanted so bad to look away or turn it off, but i couldn’t. I have never to this day felt the horrible, crushing black sadness that i felt by the end. I love that movie, it is amazing, but i don’t think i will be watching it again any time soon.&&People always cite this movie, and I always think Dancer in the Dark was the more devastating film that year.&&I think that is one of those movies that I read about (and spoiled for myself, of course), then decided not to see it.

You really have to be in a certain mood to enjoy movies like that. I don't know how to describe it, for me personally anyway, but I have to be in some certain weird mood that I'm rarely in.

edit: i just wanna add, both Blade Runner and 2001 are movies that I had to be in a certain mood to enjoy. I had seen most of those movies and never ""got it"" or enjoyed it. But on the right occasion I happened to sit down and watch both those films -- they both seemed like they were over in like 30 minutes. They sucked me in -- tractor beam. I was like 28 years old when I finally understood why the hell they were so lauded.

Sitting thru 2001, and that ending, holy shit it was like a religious experience. Just had to wait till I was in the right mood and at the right age, I guess, to finally get it and care to watch it the whole way thru.&&I'm not sure if I would enjoy that book, but I'd love a book written by philosophers about ***Badlands***&&Reminds me of a story that Pete Townshend told about how he developed his signature ""windmill"" guitar playing style.  He showed up early for a Stones show and saw Keith Richards warming up with raw energy, expressing his true inner artistry and showmanship by doing the same ""windmill"" move.

Years later, Townshend told Richards this story and got called an idiot: Richards said he was just stretching his arm before the show.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&The whole build up part of the film before shit gets *intense* was wonderful, I thought.  It kept me tense, worried, and completely unsure of what was going to happen...but in a really, really good way.  I was glued to my seat and totally on edge.

Once shit started going down...my feelings changed.  At first they changed into a ""Uhhhh, what's happening?  This is weird.  All that buildup for *this*?"".  I was disappointed during this little stretch.  Then I was just absolutely aghast for a couple scenes (which anyone who has seen the movie will know...) that just hit me hard.  And then the ending sort of disappointed me.

I still don't know how I feel about it totally.  I've mostly accepted that since 2/3 of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and hooked and another 1/6 had me utterly shocked and in disbelief and confused in a really entertaining way and that I still find myself talking and thinking about the film as a whole...I guess I liked it.  Maybe even a lot.  But as soon as the movie let out, I just felt disappointed.  Like all that excellent build up was for something that I didn't feel was worthy or fitting.  I still have mixed feelings on this film, more than maybe any other I've seen in recent memory.&&119!&&Absolutely agree. I studied music at university and found it works better in that order. We worked backwards from contemporary art music through to romantic period music and all the way back to Gregorian chant etc. It was a much better way to trace back the things you like and dislike about the current music rather than seeing how things develop. Made us much more involved and passionate about the whole topic. I imagine it's the same for film.&&Yeah pretty much. Except for Eraserhead. That's just like a fever dream you don't want to remember. &&With the exception to the rule being ""The Straight Story"".&&Same here. I disagreed with him on plenty of movies, but he's one of the few reviewers who could actually *compellingly* explain why he didn't like the movie. I rarely could say I found him unfairly hating on  a movie, because he explained his issues with it so effectively. &&He was a great go to for people who insist movie reviewers are out of touch art farts - I think it was a Bond movie where he said something that in short would be ""It's a great Bond movie, but a mediocre movie movie."" With great props to people seeing movies for different reasons that my summary may not convey. I care about many things in my movies but I know what Bond movies are and I only care if, among Bond films, it is a good or bad Bond film.&&TBH I thought something was off with her from the very start. She was way too happy, like in a fantasy land. I thought, “this won’t end well...”

However, that’s about as far as I got with the predictions. By the end, I was ....... for days.&&Here's my take, if you're interested!  Been a little bit since I've watched it, so a few details I can't quite remember.

1.  Before the credits are: the jitterbug dance (which shows a young Betty/Diane beaming alongside the elderly couple) and a POV shot that goes to bed and descends into a pillow.  For the former, I've got a lot of thoughts on the significance of the elderly couple (I think there's subtext that Diane was sexually abused by a family member back in Canada, and that the couple ties into this), but on a surface level it shows that Betty/Diane knows them in some way, which is contradicted by the next time we see them, where they've just met each other on a plane.  This right off the bat lets us know something is awry with the reality we're seeing.  The latter is more explicit: it shows someone falling asleep, and what follows is a dream.

2.  The red lampshade is in Diane's apartment, we learn in the last part of the film.  We see it once (maybe more, can't remember) in the first part, when there's the chain of phone calls regarding Rita still being missing after the failed murder.  The call goes up the chain until it reaches the phone by the red lampshade, belonging to the one who's ultimately behind the hit.  Who of course is Diane.

3.  Kesher is auditioning actresses for the Sylvia North Story.  Near the end, we learn that Diane met Camilla while auditioning for this movie (although in reality it was Bob Brooker directing/casting it).  Diane talks about how she didn't get the part, while Camilla did.  In the fantasy, shadowy powers force Kesher to cast an undeserving actress named Camilla Rhodes (instead of someone deserving, perhaps it might have been Betty, from the way Kesher was captivated by her), which helps Diane cope with why she didn't get the part in reality.

4.  The car accident happens on Mulholland Drive, more specifically at the location that Diane was dropped off before attending Adam and Camilla's dinner party where they announced their engagement.  This was the end of Diane's rope, where any hope of being with Camilla was crushed and she fell over the edge into putting out a hit on Camilla.  The trauma of the car crash mirror's Diane's emotional trauma.

5.  The hitman gives a key once the job is done, that is to say once Camilla is dead.  In the fantasy, the key opens a blue box.  The box represents terrible reality that has been contained and hidden away while Diane lives out the fantasy.  Once the box is opened with that key, the fantasy collapses and Diane is again confronted with what she did.

6.  The last part of the film is not in chronological order, and the bathrobe (which goes from clean to dingy), the ashtray shaped like a piano (which Diane's neighbor takes back at a certain point), and the coffee cup (hmm... not sure about this one) help you keep track of chronology.

7.  Club Silencio represents how we allow ourselves to believe things we know to be false, even if only temporarily.  We are told repeatedly that all the sounds are pre-recorded, yet it is incredibly easy to forget this during the performance of ""Llorando"", because of how passionate the performance is, until the illusion is rudely shattered.  This is a metaphor both for Diane's fantasy and how it will inevitably collapse and also for movies/Hollywood and the fantasy surrounding them, which the film is highly critical of.  I also think Club Silencio factors into the sexual abuse subtext.

8.  Well, Diane certainly seems to think that other factors helped Camilla.  In the fantasy, Camilla hams her way through her lip synch audition but gets the part because gangsters are forcing the director's hand.  Diane on some level believes that real Camilla's success is at least partially unearned, because this helps Diane rationalize why she was not as successful in her acting career.

9.  The man behind Winkie's represents the evil that Diane created when she put the hit on Camilla (which she did at that Winkie's).  In the fantasy, the man who observed her at Winkie's has some inkling of something evil afoot, but he is killed so there are no witnesses (putting the evil out of mind) and the fantasy can proceed.  At the end, the man behind Winkie's unleashes the elderly couple to torment Diane, making her finally face what she did before she kills herself.

10.  Aunt Ruth is filming in Canada (I think?) in the fantasy.  In reality, Diane tells people she came to Hollywood (from Canada) because her Aunt Ruth left her some money.  I believe Aunt Ruth is a fiction (A Untruth?) that Diane uses to conceal the real reason she came to Hollywood: to escape her familial abuse in Canada.&&Yeah I didn't get any further insight in knowing any of these clues. It's a great piece of history but I'd rather not let my own interpretation get bogged down with extraneous details.&&> hort summary like this for Inland Empire?

No. I haven't seen it enough. Its an offputting movie in a good way. Really bizarre and unnerving.

There are cues you can put on the film to open and shut the dowser.&&Yes, but not to the layman. I probably should have made mention of them not technically being the same.

The dowser is a mechanical flap or arm that, when closed, blocks all light emitting from the lens. 

The shutter (frequently used in consumer video projectors to mean the dowser) is a spinning metal disc with sections cut away to alternatively allow and block light from being emitted to the film or between the light source and the image element in some video projectors. This is necessary because film stops for about 1/48 of a second (so half the frame rate of film) in between the light coming from the lamp and the lens assembly. In the next 1/48 of a second, the film must advance by one frame. The light is blocked by the shutter during this movement, otherwise this sliding of the frame would be projected.&&Oh, the kids are definitely bringing back the infighting. Look up 'ace discourse' or 'bi discourse' and bring some eyebleach. &&I'll bet she did!&&Dude I read it all in in one go without stopping.

>But never again.  I drank those demons back to where they belong and they ain't gettin out again.

That's actually really beautiful man.  That should be the chorus of some desolate and slightly old school county folk anthem.  

Get on it. Please keep it acoustic though. 

*I gave a compliment to a stranger. Don't pretend that I live in a vacuum and have never heard music before.&&Yeah its hard to describe to someone how beautiful the book is but how awful the story is. McCarthy is masterful as usual with his onpoint prose but used to devastating effect particularly for The Road. The movie did nothing for me sadly. That they avoided the baby scene though, very wise...&&Go ahead and read *Blood Meridian* by the same author (McCarthy) and pray to baby jesus they never make it into a film.  The Judge should never be made into flesh. &&I have this exact feeling when it comes to Requiem for a Dream. One of the best movies I have ever watched, but I refuse to watch it again.&&If you're exceptionally depressed one day but feeling like watching something, give it a go. It's honestly pretty great, and having read the book and understanding the language used with its lack of names and such, you'll get a lot out of it.
 
 
I could never conjure a good picture of the father in my head while reading. The intensity and quietness of Viggo Mortensen really fit the part. He was great in showing the inner emotions of the father with so little dialogue.
 
 
It's also arguably easier to stomach as a movie I think. Reading the words hit like a ton of bricks. The movie was a bit of a side step to that as you didn't have the time to process the horror of certain parts like you might after finishing a chapter. &&This describes my experience perfectly. The movie did the desolate bleakness fairly well but the book just punched a gaping hole right through your chest.&&So you're saying that there was no baby in the movie? &&You are a psychopath.

I like you. Have an upvote.&&That reminds me.  I need to rent it on Sunday to show my autistic 11-year-old.   He'd love it.  There's a kid in that movie that's about his age.

Grave of the Fireflies is an all-time great tearjerker. &&I usually just end up crying whenever I try to describe that movie.  And then nobody wants to see it. &&I now have new keywords for my porn searches.&&That movie destroyed me when I saw it.

&&I find Eraserhead to be probably my favourite Lynch film because of this. It has a very clear plot, a story, with relatable and coherent themes.

Can't wait.&&For those worried, (from Entertainment Weekly):
> What’s also interesting is how even this still photo has a rather different feel than images from Justice League, which introduced Aquaman to audiences last month.  Director James Wan (Furious 7, The Conjuring) says you can expect many more differences to come. “It’s going to look very different, it will feel very different — aesthetically, tonally, story-wise — it’s my own take,” Wan tells EW. “It’s a much more a traditional action-adventure quest movie.”

> Momoa reveals we can expect to see a tale that spans details Curry’s difficult childhood as a half-human, half-Atlantean to eventually becoming king.
“Justice League was only a weekend in Arthur Curry’s life,” Momoa says. “This is a totally different beast. In Aquaman, you see when his parents met and what happened to hem. Then the little boy being raised and finding his powers and going through that and never being accepted on either side. And then becoming this man who puts up all these walls. You just slowly see this man harden up and be completely reluctant wanting to be king and not knowing what to do with these powers he has. I think James Wan just killed it.”

I really hope not.&&I wonder of they are going to talk to each other under water.&&He looks badass. Can't wait to get to see the first trailer. I hope Wan goes all out with the underwater world. This has got so much potential, the underwater world is something so rarely explored in superhero films. I hope they nail it, visually this could end up being a real stunner.

&&I can live with it.&&What if Jason Momoa was also driven around by a Turtle? &&Jason Mamoa has it in him to be a great Aquaman. I fear Snyder leadership and the meddling of idiotic movie executives will prevent any DC movies from ever reaching their potential.

WW is the best they've got. The first act was great. The second act was decent. The third act was severely less watchable due to an idiotic villain and bad sfx.

I hope they give Patty Jenkins complete freedom to make a great second movie but WB's track record suggests it's unlikely. &&the only way to tell the different roles jason mamoa plays is the amount of tattoos he has.&&You make it sound like that’s a bad thing. &&> ""Well we probably have plenty of topless photos of Jason.

Which will be explored in his movie.&&He was like a unit from Red Alert.&&I wasn’t sure whether I was laughing with him or at him in Justice League but it was definitely entertaining.

[Go Into the Water by Dethklok.](https://youtu.be/IDggqnnNuDo)&&As mentioned in the movie 'the water does the talking'&&This rendition of Aquaman was all Snyder's idea. There was an interview where Mamoa talked about it.&&AquaBalor.&&Feels like he's wearin' NOTHIN' AT ALL - NOTHIN' AT ALL - NOTHIN' AT ALL&&Roman REIGNS!&&Bitch you are now&&You're gay bruh&& Roman Reigns &&This summer - the *under*taker goes... *Under*water!&&I love the uhh.. [aesthetics](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/mediaviewer/rm763177472) as well&&> This is a totally different beast. In Aquaman, you see when his parents met and what happened to them. Then the little boy being raised and finding his powers and going through that and never being accepted on either side. And then becoming this man who puts up all these walls. You just slowly see this man harden up and be completely reluctant wanting to be king and not knowing what to do with these powers he has. 



Isn’t this just the first half of Man of Steel?&&for one the background isn't fucking CGI&&New age, new blood, right direction.  All the buzz words in the world doesn't change the fact that they're making movies with shitty characters.  I mean what's Auqaman but a glorified Spongebob?  Wonder Woman?... gimme a break.  Hollywood needs to get back to making content strong movies with good actors like Pauly Shore and Paris Hilton &&I wonder how a Snyder movie would be if there was no studio meddling. Each movie had more and more interference, so MoS will be the closest we'll get I guess (no surprise it was the best so far).

Should have specified DC, but I guess it's too late.&&Got my fingers crossed for this one.&&Well because its sexi these days and  as one of the reasons I thought it could have been because of how polynesian mythology screams sea king more than blondie guy in orange shirt. &&What DC did was, essentially, consider their characters in individual bubbles. Some characters are American through and through, so Batman, Superman, Flash and Cyborg can't really change much.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman though? Wonder Woman's *entire* origin consists of Grecian qualities. Her being portrayed as essentially American is really quite odd, considering she came from an island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. So, there's space to change her appearance and look.

The same applies to Aquaman. Aquaman is supposed to come from a uniting of the surface world and Atlantis. Who is, really, most likely to come into contact with a Queen of Atlantis, and could swoon her? You'd need someone who'd have deep knowledge of the ocean, who's culture respects and cares for the ocean, and someone who can swim *extremely* well. With all that in mind, Samoans and Hawaiians are a *perfect* choice. Part of the culture means he has tattoos, so their son has tattoos.&&I was expecting more like http://jrichardstevens.com/aquaman/Aquaman10.jpg&&This is his aquatic yard&&I love it when /r/squaredcircle leaks in other subs&&Would mark out&&Vintage Aquaman &&Big dog eats my ass&&THE BIG FISH IS HERE&&Where's Poochy?&&Run Barry!

They've basically given him Aspergers. &&Huh, today I realized they never called her 'Wonder Woman' in her solo film. Do they call her WW in BvS or JL? I can't remember.&&WB Execs: ""Good idea. Let's go with 'Seaman' instead.""&&(Opening scene) Aquaman appears and looks into the audience breaking the fourth wall. 

Aquaman: “I’m the Aquaman. You may remember me from such films as Justice League and possibly Game of Thrones”

Edit: Sorry all I never watched Stargate Atlantis, only the original movie with Kurt Russell and thin James Spader 

Edit 2: added another scene that might be gold as well somewhere in this thread&&100% this.  Keep the aquaman motifs, but never call him Aquaman.  Break up the existing associations with the name & character and they can practically start tabula rasa.&&No you see, I find this to be a bullshit cop out. If you want to make a superhero movie, don't be ashamed of embracing what makes the superhero great, including their fucking name.&&Aquaman has been a badass for a long time.  Basically any variant with a hook arm is quality shit.  &&He's always been a badass.&&A++&&Like looking into a mirror.&&It's the old Saturday morning cartoons that did it really.  The more you make him 1970s child consumer friendly, the harder it is to portray him as something other than a guy who doesn't need a scuba tank.&&even with a good actor he seems a touch redundant. He's not there to fill out the party, he's there because he's there. Flash is fast, Batsy is the planning guy, WW is the muscle, and Donatello does machines; aquaman is just another warm body. unless the ocean is involved he's just ""quite strong guy, but not as strong as other team members"".

Although when he was patrolling the midwest with a semi full of fish; I'd go bankrupt watching that movie.&&I mean I agree with you but the cartoons didn't help. My nostalgic memory of Aquaman is a dude using sonic chirping noises to summon fishes and mammals and riding dolphins. Even if that's wrong, that's all I remember about him from when I was like 7. &&Aquaman drowning europe!

I guess another example would be Simba when he was living with Timon and Pumbaa. Like, he's got some heavy shit going on at home that he's blowing off.

Edit: Yes, I know it’s arc not arch. Forgive me.&&That sounds like what he said on Graham Norton.

Another reason I'm totally ok with changing a character's ethnicity IF IT MAKES SENSE for the character, and the character's ""core"" stays the same. Some characters need to be updated or compared to more real world standards. Plus, as much as I loved the JL cartoon and the comic, how boring is it that as a kid I thought most of the League (Flash, Batman, Superman, Aquaman, and from the comics Hal Jordan) could've been played by the exact same actor (as an adult I know it's not quite that simple). &&> Pacific Ocean.

Spider-man wants to be a star, so that name makes sense, aquaman has no reason to claim that title and nobody has a reason to call him that. considering he has no secret identity just going by his given name makes the most sense. &&I disagree. With someone like superman that makes sense, but with most other (DC) characters they are trying to reinvent them so this tactic makes sense. Think the Dark Knight trilogy where they called batman ""the bat"" or even ""the batman"" and obviously ""the dark knight."" Its a great way to add depth to the character and also to distinguish it from previous portrayals of the character... But that's just like my opinion man&&There's no hook in the photo&&I actually really don't like the hook hand.  It comes from a time where they were going *hard* trying to make Aquaman ""cool"" and, imo, massively overcompensated.  

Aquaman is a very fun character when done right and I think he works best when the writers stop trying to sell him and just go with the flow.  

&&Morrison's JLA Aquahook was a badass

Basically any Aquaman not golden age and not Super Friends was a badass&&Not on Saturday mornings.&&Batman was ridiculous back then too.  Times change.  &&Well, DC tried to make him more badass with the New 52 comics. Those were pretty sweet.&&I think if you break down superheroes in that way, they all seem silly.

It's up to the writers to work with what they've been given and not shy away from it. 

I think Justice League did an alright job but missed a huge opportunity to do a great establishing, superpower, scene in the water with Aquaman. Something akin to the Injustice video games, perhaps? 

&&Nah. He's bulletproof and his trident is strong enough to injure Superman and Darseid. He's a badass. &&Well he also comes loaded with the entire Atlantean military.

The looks, (with some hair and effects), and more importantly, his charisma.  &&Looking good!&&I’d argue he’s the only one in the JL that fits any of those. Makes him unique in the group. He’s like the wild crazy one. Before, Aquaman wasn’t that unique or different than anyone else in terms of tone. If anyone could afford a makeover it was him. He may have been a badass to hardcore fans but to the general public there was no attachment and he was a dude who was weak to his own pee. &&You're welcome!&&There are no straight men, just men who have yet to be sexually awakened by Jason Momoa&&Every man is a Mamoasexual. &&Straight af, but can appreciate the look and also why it makes people sploosh. &&Eh.

It's the other way around, but yes, you are right that both become better kings and have better understanding of responsibility.&&Although WW had the advantage of being the first big female led superhero movie, but people weren't making comparisons to BvS because they marketed the tone and style of the movie pretty well.

*Say that again?*&&This is the movie I want. &&Iron Fist, on the other hand, won't shut up about being the Iron Fist.&&I swear I did hear several characters call him Daredevil.

I also loved how he never got the costume until the very end of season one&&well, danny does say ""I know who you are, you're daredevil""&&It makes sense for characters whose names describe the symbolism they intentionally project - Batman, Captain America etc.

Aquaman is obviously tied to the sea, but he isn't *dressing up as it* the way those characters are.&&Spiderman also works well for the new movie since he is just a teenager and not quite a man yet.&&But those three names have been used to refer to Batman since like...always.&&Yeah when are we going to get the Adventures of Hal Jordan&&We all know it's coming.  It fits his characterization too well for them not to do it eventually.&&I agree, he was the worst character in the Justice League cartoon. He had no personality except for ""edgy bad ass"".&&Hell, he was a badass in the New 52, as well.&&Give Peter David some credit for it, he was the guy who decided on Aquaman's hand being eaten off and also came up with the idea of Magneto ripping Wolverine's adamantium off of his bones during Fatal Attractions in X-Men #25. He's a fantastic talent who innovated a lot of changes in the 90s for both DC and Marvel characters, including the merged ""Professor Hulk"" and ""New Savage Hulk"" after Banner went to the Heroes Reborn universe following the Onslaught crossover.&&Didn’t young justice come on Saturdays also Justice League and Justice League Unlimited ?&&You're not wrong.  I was more pointing out that the general perception of Aquaman leads back to that time, and little impact has been made since then.  Aka- the whole reason why an Aquaman movie is considered so difficult.&&Batman: The Animated Series- and other titles- did a lot for the public perception of him. Aquaman hasn't had something that mainstream to change how he's viewed by general audiences.&&He needed this [scene](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82914/3262432-4277828774-28597.png). But if they save it for the solo film, then I'm fine with it.&&Riding around on a Krakken also ups his cool factor.&&he's an 15 century sculptor who's patrons are the Medici family. and he does machines.&&He can do tech shit and he's a useful ranged attacker.  

Tbh, he works better as a Teen Titan, imo.  He's not really powerful enough to be one of the seven JL members and GL and Bats cover the vast majority of his niche.  Batman can be the tech guy when needed and GL is a way more interesting ranged attacker.

He was only really brought into the league as a founding member at the start of the New 52 to add some diversity.

I get it but what bugs me is that if they wanted a diverse, interesting line-up why get rid of the green alien dude and why fuck up the original line-up at all when Jon Stewart exists?

That said, I always liked Hawkgirl in the JL cartoon so I suppose I'm not opposed to mixing-up the line-up.  Still, Jon Stewart.  Could have been cool.  

&&I mean he was pretty important in the movie considering his connection to motherbox tech.&&No Mercy&&For the sake of your people, you must go back. 

For the sake of your sake, you must indulge. &&do it. i think season one is the best season in the whole series. &&You say that a lot.&&Indeed.&&This is true...&&You are right that Aquaman doesn't personally have the power control water but, his trident does give him the ability to.

The protector of K'un-L'un? &&And Frank Castle got called the Punisher a lot. Which fits really good though.&&There is a scene in the series where someone says ""calm the fuck down!"" to him. It pretty much summed up the whole thing for me&&If my name was Iron Fist, I would make a point that my name is Iron Fist&&Slight tangent... but this kinda thing is my one gripe with the Netflix style ""binge"" shows.

If Iron Fist was running like a normal 1-episode-per-week show, they might have picked up on audience reaction early in the series, and realized that Danny Rand is an absolute tool and his show sucks.  They would have plenty of time to try and adjust course... or at least change the script for the next series so that he isn't such an integral character.  Cut your losses a bit.

As it stands, by the time Iron Fist dropped, they were already halfway through filming Defenders, so they just had to roll with it.&&They did. Definitely 100% in Defenders, which I just watched a few days ago. I’m almost positive they called him Daredevil by the end of season 1 if not in 2. &&Referred to as Selena Kyle throughout, except when they mention she's a cat burglar&&the woman of cats&&yeah me too, I always wondered where half the superheroes got their costumes from.

If the name doesn't have a connotation that goes with the character, use other things that people might realistically start calling the character after becoming aware of their existence.

In the Throne of Atlantis arc, Arthur laying down the law and staking the claim is one of my favorite Aquaman moments of all time: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uE_lo2mHPhk/Uof0GrNJAFI/AAAAAAAASwU/r-JSRcqzzaM/s1600/e98996709ee5daefb4fde00fcf24cb63.jpg

&&he also protects the world from mother fucking cthulu&&I thought he was some kind of turtle?&&Geoff Johns is the reason why. He basically reinvented the Green Lantern mythos in the 2000s (he created the concept of the Emotional Spectrum) and is a massive fanboy of Barry Allen and Hal Jordan.

The dude's a good writer, but the man has too much influence at DC, to the point where the GL books were the only ones hardly affected at all by the New 52 reboot.&&yeah i remember season 1 and 2 moving real slow, which is kinda the way it should be with that show

the last season was disappointing to me. It's like it is wrapping up and I am getting these epic pay offs, it's just... I don't know how to describe it. You can tell that the people that make the show are kinda just going thru the motions.

""well I guess we have to finish this fucking thing"" and all that. just my opinion tho, maybe people love it&&I hadn't noticed.&&in the comics aquaman can fucking flood a city, and in jl he struggles against water in a gutter.

aquaman in the comics single handedly took on the jl, including superman and superman level threats like wonder woman AND martian manhunter at the same time, and they barely won, granted, they were trying to capture him alive.

in the movie we see him struggling against common fodder.

wonder woman is at the very least ~~just as strong as superman (if not a tiny bit stronger)~~(edit: did my research again, apparently she is just very slightly weaker), not to mention way better trained at hand to hand combat.

and we see superman throwing her around like a ragdoll with one arm.

they gimped the cast so hard so superman can shine.&&Doesn't he have the trident when he holds back the water on the movie?&&> He does control water in the movie.

That kinda sucks. He's enough of a legit badass in the comic books.&&>*'Who am I gonna play?' And yeah, he said Aquaman, and I was like, 'Come again. Pardon me.' And then he explained why, ""And I was like, buddy, I got your back.'*

Cracks me up that Jason Momoa was just as confused as the rest of us but also all for it&&Now I'm sad. :(&&Yes!&&I thought that was tarantino's thing... as he has a thing for Uma Thurman's feet specifically&&*for you*&&Indeed&&6 years... and you're still not getting any love.  &&Hell yeah, it has held up remarkably well. The whole trilogy is good, but TDK is just about perfect. Begins drags a bit because they need to retread the origin story we all know for the umpteenth time and Rises just kinda lost its way I think. Still entirely entertaining, but TDK is so laser-focused and the acting so great that I sincerely doubt we'll get a Batman movie that tops it in my lifetime.&&#**HULA**&&Yup yup yup&&He just stares at the woooorld

*budada, budadah, budadah*&&Judging by production vs final product of Justice League, this might as well be from that. So much changed or removed. &&Never (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻&&Snyder movies are good when they stick to the source material&&That in itself is worthy of note, though...especially 300.

Thank you for not forgetting this.&&Played....&&He also made a star wars reference in the new series while being the trickster. Well...I thought it was a reference. It was a dramatic ""I am your father""&&In that specific episode yes he was sort of a joker analogue but on Earth 1 where the main show takes place he's basically the same trickster from the 1990 series&&And, being the voice of the Joker... he got to ""fight"" BOTH Joker and Trickster in this [Justice League Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL-VHe_4GmE) clip by impersonating them to the point where the two fought each other.&&Has its moments but it's full of CW relationships drama&&So that’s it, huh?

FTFY

&&The immortal Iron Fist, thundering dumbass&&And sworn enemy of the hand! &&Did you know his parents were killed ???&&It works real well in his case precisely because it was *other* people constantly calling him that, specifically the media.&&It also suffered from the 13 episode order bloat that most of the Netflix Marvel series have had. If they could break away from traditional television orders and contract a story instead of a season they could have had a much sharper 6 or 8 episode arc that left people curious for more. Instead they forced an origin story, a corporate boardroom drama, and an underwhelming continuation of the Hand that felt like it was only there to prep the Defenders series. &&The article at the end of season 1 calls him Daredevil I'm fairly certain&&You mean she was someone who burgled cats? Huh, TIL.&&The Woman of Cat's Kitchen &&I really liked the montage of the evolution of Deadpool's costume in the movie.&&Do you mean Danny Rand, the immortal iron fist and protector of K'un-Lun, who's parents died in a plane crash?&&I’m game&&It would totally make sense if they explain how bright colors work like camo under water, so underwater he’s like an angry ninja, and when he’s out of water people just giggle at his bright suit and he should be like “what do you mean”&&i kinda agree. these last couple seasons have lacked in the depth and nuance that we got in the earlier seasons. i mean i get it, you cant exactly start introducing a bunch of new characters and plot lines when the show is almost done, but the writing has definitely been lacking recently.&&this was the biggest problem imo, the whole movie they struggled with steppenwolf, then superman shows up and just dicks on him without any real effort. the justice league is more than superman and friends&&>in the comics aquaman can fucking flood a city, and in jl he struggles against water in a gutter.

I think in Justice League they did a bad job of explaining that he went off on his own for a while. That whole scene with Mera basically was about how he deserted them and now he has to fulfill his obligation. It's possible that was just his origin strength, and as he learns more and grows into the king, he gets more powerful.&&*snaps*&&Well, it's not like somebody gets to call dibs on that. &&Hes specifically really into redheads and feet 
In fact, the two redheads in the avengers both are shown to be barefoot in their introductory scenes 

He always has redhead girls in almost everything he makes 
And bare feet are constantly shoed in (no pun intended) into a lot of his projects 
There was an old picture I saw online of just how many times we see the girls in Buffy barefoot. Not to mention how EVERYONE in dollhouse walked around without shoes on. 

DC has or had him slotted to make Batgirl 
50 bucks says she's gonna be barefoot at some point and there will be a shot of her feet. &&I mean yeah, McKay was a beast &&I honestly have TDK up in my top 10 movies of all time, not only because I’m a comic fan but because the acting, storytelling, and character development are so perfect. In a movie that could easily be over run or feel clogged by two face and joker they manage to compliment each other and make joker the unpredictable and terrifying character that he deserved to be and in the end leaves us with a broken hero because he was right all along. It’s an amazing movie, with an amazing director, and one of the best scores of all time and I think it’ll hold up for a while. &&If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat...&&90% sure he says ""Luau!""&&┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)&&Sufferin' succotash Batman&&AQUA MAN THE GUY WHO JUST DOESNT CARE &&BIG DOG EATS MY ASS&&So The Architect is Batman, since he was the architect of the League.

The OT maybe provided a sensible chuckle from time to time, but there was never anything slap your sides funny like they are trying to do now. Why does everything have to be a comedy, Rogue one had the occasional chucke for K2-SO but the rest of the movie was real drama and plot. That is why it feels like the only true addition to the series, even barring the prequels. 

(Edit) I am going to just clarify here, I know the OT has humor in it. However, the key difference I am trying to point out is that I feel like these new movies expect you to go through the whole thing laughing. Where as the OT had some comic relief spliced into what was an action sci-fi epic. &&Is it that they took it too far, or it was too off brand? The humor in TLJ was the most glaring problem with it imo. Maybe Lord and Miller were trying to make it humor that wasn’t so pedestrian.&&What I remember reading was that it wasn't necessarily that L&M made it too funny, it's that they deviated too much from the script Kasdan wrote. They'd film a scene and have the actors improvise for further takes, and Kasdan (& co) were realizing more and more that the movie they scripted wasn't the movie that was getting filmed.&&Lord and Miller likely wouldn't kill a character on demand.....of the mouse.&&Just as fun to see your family member in a star wars movie if they were dressed as a storm trooper.

Looks like they're just going to be more shallow, goofy one-liners.

edit - The one-liner, in case anyone wants to skip the article

>""I know who you are…. FN 2187!"" Hardy's character says. ""Damn boy, I never took you for officer material!""

Said in a thick southern accent by a Stormtrooper.  Lol.&&disney is spreading this formula into every single one of their movies and its annoying &&The tone is wrong for Star Wars. A few jokes is good, but they should always feel surprising when they show up. &&I don't think it's on Hardy. Splinter Cell probably won't happen because AC flopped *hard* and Ubi probably will pull out of the movie market.&&CHROME DOME&&I feel the main problem is that it feels like none of the main characters are taking it seriously, and they even are given plot armor just for a cheap laugh. 

Opening scene: [ace rebel pilot flies a lone strike craft to the star destroyer.  Both the logical, and typical star wars response would be to send strike craft to take care of him.  Instead, nothing happens.  They don't even open fire despite being the fucking Empire.  Next, after making those stupid jokes, he then proceeds to destroy all the turbolaser towers alone...without using proton torpedos even, the only weapon capable of efficiently taking down towers that size.  Strike craft are still not sent.  It's worth noting that a Star Destroyer is essentially a battleship and a carrier fused together; there is not one scene in all of Star Wars that an attacking Star Destroyer has not deployed strike craft, save in Empire Strikes Back when they are deploying landing craft, and when they are disabled by ion cannons.  Then, he apparently pilots the x-wing like a borg cube and can apparently defy any previous convention as to how they work.  No one in the entire series, jedi or not has done that with a craft.  Especially not with X-Wings, which let me remind you are NOT the agile spacecraft of the Star Wars series; they are a medium strike fighter.  The moves he pulled off would only make sense with an A-Wing since the whole point of it is speed and maneuverability sacrificing all else.](#spoiler)  

While I did go off on a slight tangent because that scene was just annoying to me for so many reasons, the point is that a character was given plot armor for the sole reason for telling a ""yo mama"" joke - and it's only the first of many times that this happens in the movie, where the characters are actually parodies of themselves [oh and dont forget when 90% of the Republic died in The Last Jedi just because the moron captain pulled a ""BECAUSE I SAID SO"" and didn't so much as try to keep an eye on him; half of the movie was ""OH FUCK WE DONT HAVE FUEL"" and cutting to Finn and friends not only getting nothing done in futility, but even killing off 90% of the Republic when the vague instructions on how to proceed land them in oh so many situations due to ""oh we can track through hyperspace and it's not something that makes sense like having a mole or tracker on board""](#spoiler)

It's not like Star Wars is absent in humor; I recall one of my favorite amusing scenes was Han chasing stormtroopers down a hallway yelling only to find an entire division standing in formation, then running back with a somewhat higher pitched yelling.  The difference is; there was no slapstick, and it didn't put a kebash on the dramatic tension.  He didn't stop, and go ""Aw come on boys, you were celebrating the holiday and didn't invite me?"".  He fucking panicked and ran for his life.  In TLJ when the characters are in the shit because of how terrible they are at being even remotely heroic, the plot armor kicks in to diffuse the situation, or even kicking in so that they can throw their stupid slapstick one-liner while everyone is dying around them.  &&He was in the movie?&&Two instances of a certain accent is hardly obsession.&&Yeah, which is why the tickling Rey with the leaf was actually funny, as she was taking it so seriously.&&Now it's just people not taking their situations seriously. I really hate Finn now.&&The thing that bugs me is they didn't cut a single bit of Carries scenes. They really had an easy way of killing her character off. She wasn't integral to the plot at all. I understand they didnt want to cut any of her final performance, but man they had a good shot&&*cough*casino*cough*&&I've heard that the original cut was just over 3 hours long. I have no idea where they found 30 minutes to cut, as the final version felt about 30-45 minutes too long to me.&&Damn, shots fired&&Don't remind me.&&Yes I'm very glad to see major Hollywood stars who are active in other theatric universes appearing in star wars and making me think, ""oh look there's the guy from these other movies"" and remove me from the moment

A bit of comedy was brought out through the character itself and made sense, C-3PO, K2-SO having dry but completely understandable comedic moments because they're fucking robots...

TLJ had slap stick humor pasted into the world itself. It wasn't natural and took you out of the film.

Finally, we get this moment of redemption in which he's going to sacrifice himself for the greater good and Rose ruins it. That was the moment that I really hated her. Her speech at the end comes off as really narcissistic.

But the movie didn’t have “a few bad jokes” it had mostly jokes. All the way up to the end. While Kylo SHOULD have been having this severe emotional moment at the end, we got slapstick humor pushed in. 

Plus this huge sacrifice of a character I knew precious little about and mostly identified it as the actor and not the character... because the character had precious little development. Bleh...

Seriously. Reading that kinda got me hyped, but then I watched TLJ. There was loss, but it was all... temporary. The movie didn't end on a down note like Empire did. It was still hopeful. The reviewers that put that tagline in knew exactly what they were doing, they were playing off the love that fans have for arguably the best SW movie.

&&The leaf tickle was fantastic because of Daisy's and Mark's deliverance, it was also great because it was in line with Yoda's old joking around in the original movies.

Or, let me rephrase, it's not hard to make a blockbuster that's financially successful and receives good audience reviews. Critics can hate it, and it can be objectively terrible, but face it, between the Marvel movies and Michael Bay, there's no excuse. If Transformers films can continue to gross more than their disgustingly large budget, there's no legitimate excuse for making a terrible movie. 

Now, with this argument, you're obviously going to wonder why there's so many terrible blockbusters if it's as easy as I said. And that's simple: Hollywood is run by total morons. The only people with the brains in their head to figure out the formula are either working for Disney or making Transformers films. Think about it: Disney has had so many successful blockbusters lately that it no longer is logical to say it's difficult. Between Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and everything else they do, they pretty much ought to just buy the Federal Reserve at this point. If the people making these films weren't total idiots, they'd do fine. Stop trying to make video game movies. That's a stupid way of thinking. You don't make book movies, you adapt the plot of the book into a movie. Remember Ang Lee's Hulk and how it took the concept of a ""comic book movie"" stupidly literally? That's the problem with video game movies. Take the plot or the universe as a whole and adapt it into a film. Halo did it pretty well by making it an original story in the universe. Making a Splinter Cell movie would be easy. Get people known for making good spy movies and adapt the characters and plot into a movie. Bam. Hollywood is just stupid. &&Who's scruffy looking?&&I guess it's just odd because Leia is still out there. It wouldn't be in character for her to just retreat and disappear after handing off the Resistance to Poe. The only reasonable option would be for an off screen death, which is kind of disrespectful to Carrie.

^^lol jk, shit was dumb^^

But yeah, I agree. It does seem pretty forced (no pun intended) that this is still a story about a vastly overpowering militaristic empire vs a small faction of rebels. It just doesn't make sense.

Like, the Empire was defeated and the galaxy instituted a Republic. Yet the Republic just fucked off a let the Empire remnants do whatever the fuck they want? Becoming a massive force that is somehow able to wipe out this new galactic Republic in 2 seconds, with one laser beam spanning the whole galaxy?

And then, why the hell is there even a resistance? If they won, shouldn't they just be the Republic's military? You're not the ""resistance"" if you're on the winning side that supposedly rules the galaxy.

It's like the original trilogy didn't happen.&&#***TLJ SPOILERS AHEAD TURN BACK NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT***

I think that TFA set a nice tone and basis for a new trilogy, since we were shot forward about 30 years from the end of the OT. It would make sense that there was an awakening and some new heroes were formed and the rebellion kickstarted. Of course I didn't want a repeat of the OT of simply rebels and empire back and forth, which is why I was excited at the bit where Kylo and Rey are fighting together and he offers her a chance to start everything over forgetting the rebellion/first order/Jedi, I feel like it could have taken it in an exciting new direction. I did enjoy TLJ in the end but I do feel that the tone didn't entirely fit with the star wars genre and a few characters annoyed me.&&[deleted]&&At least Abrams nailed the spirit and energy of a Star Wars film. TLJ feels like a chimera of marketing research and Rian Johnson’s power trip.&&

>I most of all resent Abrams for hitting the reset button when he started off the whole trilogy, making sure to lock Star Wars into the dichotomy of Empire vs. Rebels again for no reason at all.

That's one of the few major complaints I have with how this trilogy is turning out. Have your opinion on the prequels, but at least the concept of Star Wars ""politics"" was different than the traditional empire vs rebels  and opened up the opportunity of a wealth of stories and lore. The movies weren't very good on their own, but damm it if I don't love the Clone Wars era.

&&Rogue One was the only movie to give me that Empire feel. The new trilogy is good but there was no feeling of dread and loss quite like Empire.&&Yeah I have to disagree. The resistance went from a fleet to one ship - the Falcon.&&that was hilarious &&[deleted]&&the last awakens?&&I think TFA was much better at balancing its humor.  It had some gags that were genuinely funny, but it didn't use them to make the movie a comedy, it used them to make the movie feel optimistic.  It used them to make the growing bond between Rey and Finn more believable.

This movie completely dumpstered General Hux as a comedy relief character when he was the new Grand Moff Tarkin, and it was tonally inconsistent across the board.  The humor mostly didn't land and it was misguided in the first place since it disrupted any sense of dread they were trying to build.&&> the leaf tickle scene was absolute gold

I loved this too. Not only was it hysterical, it totally seemed in character&&My biggest laugh was the ""ok that is nowhere"" line&&I totally forgot about that steam iron scene, but it got me laughing. When it happened it made me think of a post on here where someone was showing that the ships from Star Wars were based off household appliances or something like that.&&Chrome dome was dumb as fuck though.&&I laughed, but still thought it was stupid and took away from the movie.

Major characters played for comic relief was kinda sad and out of place.&&> The intercom on-hold convo

That was cringe-inducing to me, and took me right out of the movie.&&Yeah, that gets me too. There's a lot of good jokes in that movie that hit really hard after all these years. &&C3PO was a joke machine in the OT. I don't get how people don't remember that he was also in humorous situations. In ESB all he did was complain (humorously) about being on Chewie's back&&C3PO and Jar Jar were both annoying joke delivery characters, the difference was that other characters seemed to be aware C3PO was annoying. In the OT they ask if he has an off switch and tell him to shut up multiple times, whereas with Jar Jar you feel like you're taking crazy pills since nobody acknowledges he's irritating and a complete buffoon. &&i liked jar jar... i was like 7 tho&&He almost certainly means [Benicio del Toro/Codebreaker](#spoiler)&&Isn't that a large part of the problem with the film? Problematic dialogue that turns good scenes into awkward scenes and sequences that don't actually lead to anything?

It's why people have such a hard time rating TLJ, it's a fantastic film with a shocking amount of execution problems.&&Except that sounds exactly like what it was. My goodness.&&Congratulations on being a dolt.&&Thats literally what the scene was tho u hating so much u forgetting context.&&I kinda liked that bit cause it showed that the stormtroopers aren't just idiots :P&&[deleted]&&Seriously. Everyone above is arguing how an funny/unfunny line got cut. Humor had nothing to do with it; Disney saw a racial joke in this political climate and noped right the fuck out of there.&&""😂😂😂😂WHOS MANS IS THIS?! 😂😂😂😂""&&I think this is one of the biggest problems. Catering movies for easy dubbing and subtitles. &&I agree, though I wish Thor Ragnarok did some of the serious bits better. The deaths of main characters at least.&&I'd rather kiss a wookiee&&Haha literally when I went to the toilet, I could see nothing great was gonna happen. I have no idea how they escaped the casino jail, when I came back they were letting a space horse into the wild &&That was a huge theme of this movie.  Kilo is not as pure evil as previous Star Wars bad guys and the heroes, including Rey, Luke, and Poe are not as pure good as previously thought.&&Yep their arcs were pretty great.

As was their relationship...which weirdly enough went pretty far down towards fanfic lane, one might say their chemistry is a bit too good.&&Danke.&&I mean it *does* rain in deserts even if its rare.

But for all intends and purposes we can assume she hasn't or it was so rare that its something really special for her, like for LA people.&&There's coconut milk.&&they could've just made leia sacrifice herself, after purple hair's failed, also take out that leia fly scene, what the flying F was that.&&The 2017 humor was so out of place. The silliness of Yoda was great though. They should stick to that.&&Throne room was awesome but made no sense, no way in hell should Rey have been skilled enough to take those ultra elite guards on, the light speed kamikaze was beautiful but broke the lore, why doesn’t everyone do that?&&Why couldn't they just use a few ships and lightspeed into the death star?

Why not just keep a few ships piloted by droids and have them lightspeed into any enemy ship that appears? 

They gave starwars a instakill anything weapon and you can have a droid do it. That bothers me

They wasted like 4-5 bombers and dozens of rebel lives when they could have just sent one ship to lightspeed into that fleet killer in the beginning&&Did we have to have a scene where he milks a tit and then drinks it while looking directly at the camera though? He couldnt just have a jar of blue milk in his hut? Like that was a choice they made.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Not only was she a bad character, but they gave her some awful dialogue to boot. I thought she was just a bad actor but when I saw it a second time, she nails some parts, she just has trouble turning the shit they were feeding her into coherency. 

Like, the word is WAR PROFITEERS. Use the term WAR PROFITEERS.&&Chewie's homeworld is Kashyyyk, you bigot.&&There's No Country for Old Men&&So business is slow? &&Woooosh, a new hope my man. &&As someone else noted, if she survived the events of the TFA her armor can repell blaster fire, so falling into a big fluffy fireball seems like not so much. If they did get rid of her I feel like Rian is giving a finger to all the work of Kasdan and Abrahms in trying to build an OK villain.&&I reckon she did. She could have easily died in the trash compactor on Starkiller base but escape that. &&I wish we could have seen the First Order as an rebellion. Have Kylo be the shift in the Republic keeping it contained. Then it creates a need for someone to match it. &&How often has that happened on earth? It would  be like the US gaining independence and banning a military afterwards. &&I servery disliked how small scale TLJ felt, Star Wars has such a massive universe and I feel like we hardly see any of it&&Rogue One was one of the best films of the entire franchise. Maybe not ESB but a strong contender for #2.

The film wasn't perfect (like, I couldn't figure out why Forrest Whittaker's character was in the film at all, and the opening 10 minutes were so insanely rushed I had no idea what was going on or who was who) but literally all of that was forgiven just for *literally* the last one minute and fifty seconds of the film.

Jesus, if anything Rogue One's worst part was that it had such likable characters but the film - by its nature - required it to end the way it did and was 'standalone'. &&In a 9 movie story arc can you expect anything else?

Episode 9 will be some form of reconciliation between the light side and dark side.  I think there are 2 likely scenarios for this:

Scenario 1:  The light side and dark side reach reconciliation through mutual destruction,   Kylo and Rey start their own force school teaching both the light and dark side of the force.  The Skywalker prophecy is fulfilled in that Kylo is the descendant of Leia and Rey is the last pupil of Luke.

--Hard to say where the new trilogy takes place as the conflict throughout the Skywalker arc is resolved.    

Scenario 2:  Kylo is betrayed by Hux and joins the Rebels.  Kylo teaches Rey about the dark side of the force, Rey becomes his moral balance and it is revealed by Leia that Rey is in fact a Skywalker.  Rey and Kylo revert to old school Jedi ways and master both sides of the force.

-- New trilogy is focused on what becomes the New Jedi order years later amidst a struggle with the ""Second"" Order and a vengeful trade federation.&&Would you rather have a hundred Falcon-sized fleets, or one fleet-sized Falcon?&&It was like 4 ships to begin with.  The entire resistance apparently was a single person from every inhabitable world.  The scale started in TFA is just terrible &&I was under the impression the years of solitude of dagobah and his old age had made him just a bit loopier than he was before the fall of the Republic.&&Dude is in the Force now, he can do whatever he feels like now. &&I didn't think he was 'crazy Yoda'. He burns the tree and acts that way to distract Luke from the fact that Rey burgled the tree of the Jedi books. Yoda can still have a bit of a sense of humor. Charming isn't the opposite of wise.&&Maybe because Luke thought he was being wise, and Yoda needed to try a different approach than ""wise master"" to help get his head out of his ass&&The Last Airbender by M. Night Shamalamadingdong&&I mean, that is actually an old joke, but I agree it worked in the context and was funny. It made a place we really don't know about, Jakku, seem more relatable. &&Mine was Rey saying she'd rather not do this right now and Kylo Ren responding ""Yeah, me too"".&&[deleted]&&Kinda fitting considering how dumb the phasma character is&&I agree it's kinda silly, but I didn't even think of it as a joke as much as just passing dialogue. &&chrome dome crystal critters

new band name&&To me, it felt like something her subordinates had been saying about her behind her back for years.&&Obi Wan pointed out he was an irritating idiot.&&He didnt sacrifice himself though? [He sold them out? Which was to be expected because he was clearly a heroin addict or something.](#spoiler)&&""*THAT'S HOW WE SAVE EVERYONE, SILLY!*"" - says the girl after she prevented the destruction of a weapon that seconds later blew a hole in a Rebel fortress and allowed the First Order to slaughter everyone inside (slaughtered, if it wasn't for Luke).&&I mean, problematic dialogue is a Star Wars staple right?&&No a large problem is that Rian Johnson liked to subvert expectations so much that he did it at the expense of the plot.

&&Plot twist: /u/Featherwick is Rian Johnson.&&It didn't feel forced to me, though looking at it empirically it should have. And it isn't even a romantic chemistry that they have, but you do get a sense of this really *intense* connection between the two. The exchange in the throne room after the fight, that *please*, that was probably my single favourite thing in the entire film.&&De nada &&Mary Poppins y'all. &&Its pretty clear that Leia was going to be a major part of IX before Fisher passed. Killing her off at any point in VIII would've fucked up her reunion with Luke.&&Should’ve made Ackbar fly through space. Now he’s just a frozen corpse floating in a vacuum.&&Yep. People will continue to hand wave this away because they liked the movie. It is ok to like the movie AND admit the hyperspace scene opens up a can of worms, but a ton of people who liked the movie will just keep defending it. It was a bad play by whoever okayed it (be it director/producer/Disney).&&Goofy aliens are not new to the series&&Yes, it shows that he gives no shits anymore, like Yoda when we first see him on Dagobah&&What term does she use? Only seen it once.&&Yeah, I was reading an article on the difference between good acting vs good writing. Sometimes we love an actor, but they were terrible and the only reason we liked them was because the character on its own is great. Other times , like in this case the actor can be amazing, but if you give her dumb lines she will be annoying.&&Ha! Get a load of this stupid *space liberal* you guys!

Uh oh, we better call Wookiestan by the right name or else you'll shoot us with your **PC BLASTERS** haahahaahaha shuttup nerd.

#  /r/EmpireDidNothingWrong&&A proud Kashyyyk-American. &&What, do we just dump them out in international waters? &&Yeah, those are rookie numbers. &&Ever get that feeling o deja vu?&&But the broken helmet... 

If she survives that, she'll be a female Zuko.&&Good point.&&how the fuck could the Disney creative dept. factory not conjure something like this up! the premise is exactly what was needed. the empire/First Order needed to flip to the rebellion (underdog role) and guess who put them over the top, Kilo turns- gaps, and then empire/first order goes on the offensive to reclaim its dominance...i dunno, something like that would have been better than A New Hope 2.0 and i dont even know that the fuck that Marvel movie was called TLJ &&Yeah.  I like the new films (could have been a lot worse, imo), but I'm kind of perplexed as to how the First Order is so powerful.  I would have thought there would have been a kind of role-reversal, like the Alliance trying to stamp out the last pockets of the Empire and then Kylo Ren shows up and rallies them making them a serious threat.&&I'll take it one further: I *liked* Forrest Whittakers character. I liked the whole idea of a side that was technically with the rebels but they splintered because they were psychotic and cruel. I like how weird he was. I like how he trained her and that explains why she is so good as a soldier. 

The only part that was dumb was that whole brain reading octopus part. That was a dumb part.&&I thought R1 had, by far, the least likable characters in the entire saga. But that's me. 
&&Oh, I totally disagree. Kylo probably redeems himself somehow at the end but I don't think the whole ""light/dark"" side dynamic changes. Kylo just joins the light.&&i just became aroused&&Carrier has arrived.&&Also, Mark Hamill was probably the best thing about that movie.&&Seriously, after her basically doing nothing in The Force Awakens I assumed they were gonna flesh her out in TLJ. Nope still didn't do shit. She feels like a last minute add in to sell toys and put in promo stuff.&&Finn doesn’t strike me as the wisecracking-while-in-danger type of character.&&It reeked of a Pirates of the Caribbean type of dialogue. I think smart ass remarks should be restricted to certain characters within the Star Wars universe.&&In retrospect, I think OP was referring to [Admiral Holdo](#spoiler).

[The Codebreaker](#spoiler) was the only character that came to my mind at the time that everyone refers to by by the actor's name.&&By far the dumbest part of the movie. &&Finn's speeder was already melting he would've died without changing a thing.&&*You overestimate my scriptwriting power*&&The ""please"" is what makes the movie for me. It's so choice. Obviously the whole throne room scene is meant to evoke Vader asking Luke to join him, the lines are almost identical. The ""please"" is more indicative of the movie's theme of letting go of the past than Kylo straight up saying ""Kill it, if you have to.""

In that moment, Kylo goes from being intimidating, projecting power and authority, to absolutely begging Rey to save him. It's powerful.&&Fucking hell maybe I actually *did* like the movie.  I'm gonna have to see it again.&&[Superman.](https://streamable.com/9ftxc) Spoilers, btw. &&[deleted]&&Fun fact, the suffix -stan means ""land of"" so saying Chewie is from Wookiestan, is basically saying Chewie is from land of Wookie.&&/r/The_Senate&&[deleted]&&Yes, and it's a really reckless endangerment to the ocean. Please take the time to sign the petition for Pro-Soilent Green legislature.&&Not a bad thing to add to the universe.&&Only if she suddenly starts redirecting lightning somehow. &&I swear to god&&The think it’s because the most recent films were the prequels which already did that with the Sith taking over. They wanted the heroes to be the underdogs again but Return of the Jedi didn’t set them up for that. They could have just had the Resistance be the Rebellion army in TFA and became known as the Resistance at the end of the film or start of Last Jedi. 
&&After seeing TLJ I firmly believe that there were no long term creative decisions planned or made. Disney wanted to buy lucasfilms and thats as far as they went, theyre making the rest of it up as they go.&&Sounds a lot like the prequel trilogy&&Its hard in story telling to have the villain in the underdog role. People like to root for the underdog. Dont want to see heroes beat up on weaker foes, it makes them look less heroic. Its why in lots of fights the hero is disadvantaged somehow, outnumbered, wounded, ect...  
Not saying it wouldnt work, its just harder to make work. &&They kind of lay the ground work of like a ""military industrial complex"" that keeps conflict going in the Galaxy for profit. Watch the Canto bight scenes again. I don't know if they will expand on this premise or not. That kind of answers your question on how they are so equipped. When war is for profit, how can peace flourish sort of deal? Pretty much mirrors what is happening in real life. Could be interesting commentary on modern Life if they take it that far. &&> The only part that was dumb was that whole brain reading octopus part. That was a dumb part.

It made sense, they didn't trust the pilot. What didn't make sense is for them to not trust the pilot even after the brain reading octopus did it's work.&&I literally forgot about the brain octopus... why the hell was that even in the movie? 

I liked his character too but we weren't given any time to learn anything about him, what he did, or why he did it. It was a bad case of 'tell not show'. I think there was a lot of potential there to explore what he was about (a terrorist more than anything). Instead he just kind of opens the hatch (I literally thought he was one of the Deathstalkers at first since his armor looks almost the same in that first scene) and then... uh... that's basically it, then we're back to the girl and Saw is nowhere around.

From what I understand, he was largely there because he was in that Clone Wars thing I never watched. I can't feel that that's not 100% my fault, you shouldn't be forced to watch something that isn't connected to the movies to 'get' the purpose of an entire character.

**EDIT:** That said after Rian Johnson's fucking disaster of a film, the brain octopus is far from the worst example of something that didn't need to be in a film. &&Yea I haven’t seen Star Wars rebels but the character does show up in clone wars as a youn man. So they are working this whole giant story’s from the ends to the middle now. So I was willing to watch him knowing that at some point the character and his presence is going to mean more than it does now or at least at the time R1 came out. &&BOR GULLET&&Everything he said that was meant to be funny was. It was like whoever was directing and producing the movie (bit Rian Johnson) decided to stick their dick in everything but Mark Hamill. &&I get the feeling they created the character thinking she'd naturally find a place in the story, and it just never materialized. Recently, when asked why she wasn't really featured in the movie, Johnson basically just said there was no time for her.&&I don't understand why they bothered bringing in Gwendoline Christie for that role. It could have been played entirely by a stunt performer. Seems a complete waste of a talented actress.&&What the hell do you think Boba Fett was? He was on screen in the original series for like 15 mins then died a pathetic death. C'mon now. &&What you mean someone raised from birth to be as killing machine and suffering from severe ptsd shouldn't be cracking wise?  It's treason then. &&I keep telling my friend this movie felt too Marvel-y to me. I was half expecting the Guardians to show up in an after credits scene.&&It actually would have been an amazing scene if she had rammed Finn out of the way and charged the laser herself. Even the same line would have worked, just delivered over radio right before she hits it &&It's a message that would have been fine had a REBEL COMMANDER NOT JUST COMMITTED SUICIDE HEROICALLY TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THAT SCENE&&The only saving grace of that scene (which even then not by much) is that it looks like Finn is just as surprised and thinking ""Are you fucking serious right now?"" as much as the audience. &&Nah, dumbest part is that after they both crashed their planes, one is unconcious and being carried by the other, right under the first order sights...they still manage to reach the rebel base, UNHARMED and FASTER THAN THE FIRST ORDER THAT'S ON SPACE SHIPS AND AT-ATs

HOW THE FUCK? FINN had fucking beskar plot armor on this movie&&Should've been followed by a wide shot showing that Finn was nowhere near reaching the weapon. Like, hilariously far away.&&Why did he fly through the beam the whole time? Shoulda just flew parallel until he got closer.. &&Why wouldn't she just shoot then? He already tried to, so they were at close enough range. They were like right in front of it. The cannon was massive, bigger than an AT AT body, so she definitely could have hit the back of the cannon at an angle not directly in front of it.

And when they crashed, they were directly in front of the walker line and pretty far from the base. They should have been completely obliterated realistically. Her firing and destroying the cannon would have kept both of their speeders intact so they could get back quickly/safely.

And, again they were super close, and it took a few minutes until the cannon actually fired. He definitely would have made it in to suicide bomb the thing.

Whole scene made no sense.&&He was also the only one still charging at full speed. Everyone else fell back, meaning she literally couldn't have caught him anyway...&&He was going to ram the cannon. Maybe it was getting deformed, but the mass remained the same, and at that speed... doing any damage would prevent the shot.

PS: why was the speeder melting but not his skin wtf&&The complexity of his character fueled by Driver's performance makes him one of the most interesting features of a billion dollar franchise with space jets and magic powers &&[Do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRW0RM4V0k)&&The second watch through is amazing. Admittedly I loved it the first time, however going back with a series of theories and watching it through that lens was amazing.

 Also am sexually attracted to John Williams music. 
Source: am music major. &&Except for misspelling wookiee&&Sooo, instead Wookiestan we call it Wookie**ss**tan and everything is fine?&&Yeah but that would take something we like to call: an original thought. And JJ/Disney don't do that.&&im pretty sure rian johnson confirmed this in a tweet&&The prequel trilogy had the two forces fighting on equal ground (Republic vs CIS).

The OT had an underdog good force vs the powerful bad force (Rebels vs Empire)

This was the perfect opportunity to have powerful good force vs underdog badguys (Republic vs Last Order).

Disney dropped the ball there, I think. 

Picture this for the first scene in TFA:  Instead of a dangerous and powerful Empire force invading a peaceful settlement and pushing their shit in, have a secretive task force made up of shadow trooper type agents sneaking into a New Republic installation.  Taking out troops stealthily, planting bombs, and other clandestine shit.  They get caught towards the end of their mission, a small firefight breaks out.  That's when one of Luke's pupils shows up.  The Jedi Order, while far from its former glory, is finally starting to resume their roles as peacekeepers.  The Jedi drives the Last Order back, only to be confronted by Kylo Ren.  A short lightsaber fight, and Jedi is dispatched.  Kylo finishes off the rest of the good guys, then turns to his troopers and tells them to start the timers.  The bombs are activated, Kylo and co. leave in stealth as the installation blows up behind them.  

That would have blown my socks off for a beginning.  Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but that would have hooked me immediately.&&agreed- the new movies were simply unnecessary bc there was nowhere for the fundamental plot to go unless u repeat the past-empire and rebels could merge and a new resistance could be found? everything is a cycle and Star Wars 1-6 displayed the cycle. &&You can trust the pilot to absolutely believe *what he believes* after mindrape-topus did its job. You can't trust that the information he had was legitimate or given in good faith.&&Lol in every Star Wars film, you have stupid shit that just shouldn't be there and feels out of place. The brain octopus was, thankfully, very short.&&the brain reading octopus originally had more time in the movie that would have made him make a bit more sense but it got cut out i believe&&I think there is a theory the brain octopus had more influence on  the plot before the reshoot. Something about it resulting in the Middle eastern/ Indian guy losing his mind over the rest of the film. &&It kinda felt like Mark Hamill was just like, ""Look, I'm Luke Skywalker, you can't do this movie without me and I'm going to be the best Luke Skywalker I know how to be."" Whatever the reason, though, I really appreciated his performance.&&She would've taken valuable time away from the critical Canto Bight side quest /s&&The only reason Phasma exists is because she was originally concept art for Kylo and Kathleen Kennedy saw it and said ""that has to be in the movie"". &&That's true, I feel like he at least worked better than Phasma because he was at least established as a badass in those 15 min like the scene at Jabba's place. In the TFA phasma is just taken hostage and used as a plot device and in TLJ she just gets her ass beat. &&Fett is never around because he's not actually part of the Empire, he's just hired to do a job and he manages to take down a main character while looking totally badass (then dies pathetically). Phasma is supposed to be part of the Imperial leadership but is never around and never actually does anything successfully. She's just Finn's manager.

EDIT: Plus; ""no disintegrations"". Even Vader thinks this guy is a bit too violent. It sets him up perfectly.&&But he has the same aura about him as Vader. We don't really see Vader do a lot of bad ass things. It's just the fact all the other characters are terrified of them, and they are shown to be cunning, like Boba following the falcon after the asteroids. Phasma never does anything bad ass, in fact she caves and does exactly what the good guys tell her to do and the star killer base is cause she wouldn't take a bullet or even try and fight.&&Nick Fury comes in and recruits Rey to join the Avengers.&&This. Wow that’s so much better. She’s a pointless character that didn’t need to be saved at all. 

Hot take: I definitely think they wanted to include an Asian character that was central to the story solely to make the universe more diverse and to appeal to the Asian market overseas. Guess it’s all about $ these days. &&That would be perfect. And she doesn't even have to die. She could drop out of her ship with the floorboards giving way before the crash. It was already established that these ships are flimsy. &&That would have made so much more sense. Now i basicly hate her character for that scene, the one you propose would have made me love her.&&She was clearly a little delirious after crashing though&&Holy shit, didn’t even realize this. Lmao &&How did one ATAT not hit either of them when they were firing? Why weren't they shot at after the crash when they were right there next to the enemy like sitting ducks. How the hell did Fin drag her all the way back without getting shot at? Plus that's a long ass time and a lot of work to drag her all the way back to the base. Nothing made sense. &&Finn's skin is actually 40% dolomite. &&The mass was definitely not the same, all kinds of shit was falling off that thing.&&",2017-12-22 12:02:50

&&Overall just a strange trailer. 

What was the point about Blue being alive? 

Why show the Carnotaurus getting killed?

Obviously that explosion scene isn't the climax, as Claire and the intern facing down that dinosaur has lava coming from the ceiling, but why focus on that scene? Why is Rexy killing when all the other dinos are running?

Can't they just make new dinosaurs?&&Did I just watch a trailer for a single scene? &&[When the Goldblum is just right](https://i.imgur.com/ONoyrlL.gif)&&Underwhelming? &&Jurassic Park: I DONT KNOW WHAT WE’RE YELLING ABOUT &&So they voluntarily took children back to the island?

*Edit* Apparently the ""[girl](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4427331/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t12)"" in the trailer is 30. And the other kid is in his 20's.&&That trailer was...weird...I really didn't understand what the narrative was...very underwhelming and just weird...&&The original Jurassic Park trailer didn't even show the dinosaurs. This trailer appears to reveal many of the plot elements in addition to the which dinosaurs are included.


I'm glad the T Rex appears to still be the protagonist though. &&It seemed all over the place, I don't know. That's the impression I got. Then again, it is a trailer. &&So they're taking dinosaurs off the island, AGAIN?&&That trailer felt like Geostorm, but with dinosaurs. &&I love Jurassic Park and this trailer did nothing for me. Hope it was just a bad first trailer and not a sign of the movie &&I guess I shouldn't be surprised Hollywood can ruin Jurassic Park, but wow, they are going to go ahead and do it.... again&&I was hoping this movie was going to be the courtroom drama for the criminal negligence case against Bryce Dallas Howard. After seeing this trailer, I seriously think that would've been a better direction.&&Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies ever and Jurassic World was fun and entertaining enough in comparison to the original sequels... but this, this looks absolutely terrible.&&Either Chris Pratt has super-powers and can survive pyroclastic flow, or he is dead. So.... RIP Chris Pratt.&&Ooof, this looks almost like a parody of Jurassic Park. Like the Sharknado of dinosaur movies.&&I am soooo not into this&&Just posted this in r/jurassicpark. I hope this isn't too unpopular of an opinion, but this trailer sets up really bad expectations for me. The BRoll teaser released the other day had an interesting, darker, horror-esque element and tone to it that seemed really interesting, consistent, and necessary for story progression: the potential for something more serious and tangible, rather than the off-set tone and unrealistic nature of ""Jurassic World."" This trailer feels so off, and showcases too much of the one volcano scene, too much of the ""Remember Blue?!?!?!"", and too much of random scenes, rather than give a sense of the film as a whole. If the whole film is explosive set-piece after explosive set-piece, I can't help but feel that Trevorrow and Connelly don't understand what people enjoyed about the original, or even ""Lost World"" and ""III"" to an extent - they are about realistic plausibility in the established scientific story world, with tangible and realistic characters. This trailer hints at nothing but Michael Bay-esque set pieces and grandeur. It feels wrong. Positives, though - I love Bayona, and I am stoked to see him at the director's helm. He is an atmospheric visionary, and will likely bring some excellent elements to it. I just fear for that script, mannnnn. Also, as much as I pick it apart, of course I am gonna be there opening night, because I am a fucking avid consumer of JP, and I have got to see everything that comes out of the series with eager eyes.&&I wouldn't have showed the Carnotaurus being killed, but I'm still hyped for this.&&So... it's basically the fan film version of what Jurassic Park 2 would've been had The Lost World never been written? But with shittier characters?

I imagine a lot of pitches in 1994/95 were exactly what Fallen Kingdom looks like, but swap Grant and Ellie for Pratt and High Heels. 

Also, isn't this the plot to Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues on sega?&&jurassic world was terrible and this looks somehow even worse&&The people who put that trailer together are probably going to be fired. I enjoyed JW and you can't judge a film by its trailer but that trailer was very, very sloppy. One of worst seen for a blockbuster in sometime.&&This is a high budget B Movie folks&&Volcanoes and dinosaurs? How do they go more over the top? I look forward to Jurassic Armageddon. Another asteroid is coming to finish what it’s brother started 65 million years ago, but this time the dinosaurs are ready! Chris Pratt and the velociraptor train to be astronaut oil drillers who will destroy the asteroid before it can impact the eart, but things get crazy when they find out that a T-Rex has stowed away on their spaceship!&&What a terrible trailer. Like, that was really, REALLY bad. Not even Bayona directing can get me excited because that trailer was just a massive fail. &&What a bizarre trailer... I felt really weird watching that.&&Pretty sure I just saw the whole movie. Thanks for saving me the ticket money! &&So the island Jurassic World was built on was in fact an active volcano?...

Either they were incredibly stupid planning that, or the reason its blowing up has to do with some subplot about the island's geothermal power plant and its abandonment somehow causing the volcano to erupt?

&&""We want to have dinosaurs fighting each other, but ALSO have a volcano erupting at the same time. So the dinosaurs fall off a cliff! We'll call it FALLEN Kingdom. Get it? FALLEN!""

****cigar falls out of Legendary Execs mouth****&&A group go to an island full of dinos heavily armed to capture said dinos among the ruins of a park and research facilities, and also Jeff Goldblum is in it.  Why does this movie feel so much like Lost World?&&Maybe they used up their CGI budget on the trailer, and 2/3 of the movie is Jeff Goldblum sitting in a Senate hearing. Judging by the trailer, I would actually rather go see that.&&Spared no expense&&In both books and The Lost World movie at least, they make it a point to say that the islands run on geothermal energy, and that the island chain they are a part of are volcanic in origin. Geothermal doesn't really exclude an active volcano, but it's still weird for one to be their choice of construction site.&&To be real pretty much any oceanic island is a volcano. The real question is ""did they build it on a dormant volcano instead of an extinct one.&&Yes, as the near surface geothermal properties allowed endless free power, and the system was spared no expense, down to gold plated turbines to resist corrosion. (Lost world, they cover it when they find the power plant at Site B) 

The entire island chain of the 5 deaths are volcanic in nature.&&Call me a dinosaur,  but I prefer the original Jurassic park story line.&&So down for a new disaster movie called Voldino. Mountain full of dinosaurs spewing all over the place on a small north western town. &&Dante's Peak AND Volcano. I forgot about those two movies. Thank you&&Dante's Peak > Volcano

admit it&&Only thing missing is to have Tommy Lee Jones as some old park ranger.&&But are back together by the end of the film... for survival. &&if parents who send their kids away to a dinosaur island during christmas to get divorced can get back together, so can 2 lead protagonists with no chemistry&&Gonorrhea cant see us if we dont move. Wait! I was wrong I was thinking of a T-rex!&&Exactly the first thought I had, but I did just watch that episode. So a bit fresh in my mind.&&I thought the T-Rex was trained to follow the flare.  If that's the case, her actions in this trailer would make sense too, since it is trined to be around humans.&&Well we all sympathize that T-Rex cannot jerk off&&Well after everyone bitched about the Spinosaurus killing the one in JP3, yes it probably is. &&And they say hollywood doesn't have strong female leads.&&I've said before and I stand by it. Chris Pratt and the others are fools for training raptors instead of T-Rexes.

The T-Rex has time and time again saved humans for no reason other than shits and giggles. In the last movie she coordinated with both humans and raptors despite being locked in a steel box while humans and raptors learned to coordinate.  She's outlived two Ingen CEO's, a fuckload of tourists, and is more compelling on-screen than Bryce Dallas Howard.

This series has been a matriarchy from the very beginning. Long live the queen.&&As she should be!&&The protagonists are the morally bankrupt people in charge of the park. The T-Rex is a result of their bullshit. &&They paid a lot of money to have Ryan Reynolds voice-act as the T-Rex.&&Jurassic Origins: Rexy

Coming Summer 2020&&In Jurassic World 3, the T.rex is going to be hired by the US government to train a new breed of elite special forces team of weaponized dinosaurs to fight terrorists and part-take in dangerous missions.&&I felt weird watching it. It felt like a 3rd party youtuber made it using footage from the movie, but with no context on what the movie is about. &&Agreed, it lacked focus. Like it was unsure of what tone it wanted to show off. In the end it just looked quite generic really, with over the top blockbuster moments lacking any subtlety or tension. 

Give me a movie full of raptors in the kitchen/cornfield/Rexy in the rain/Spinosaurus by the plane level tension. I couldn't give less of a fuck about the CGI explosions and theme park ball shit. I know the characters won't be in danger here. It's all spectacle with no substance.

&&ಠ_ಠ someone for the love of god rearrange all those clips in a way that makes sense !!&&I don’t even get it. Not only was the pacing off, but the content... it feels like the most unnecessary sequel in years. The first JW gave us something new, this just feels... random.&&Yeah, it was all over the place. Even managed to make the excerpt of the theme music annoying with the stopping and starting. Hopefully it's just the trailer. I do think another sequel can be good and I'm rooting for Bayona.

Edit: Rewatching it, I think the music's a big sign of why it feels so weird. You go from upbeat vinyl song to creepy music to violins to action music to silence to volcanic explosion and action music, back to the violins, then some more action music before finishing up with some violin theme. Like TheJoshider10 said, it lacks focus.&&Who would have guessed everything with the dinosaurs would have gone bad again.&&> Crichton creates Malcolm, Crichton destroys Malcolm, Goldbloom embodies Malcolm, Crichton ham-handedly revives Malcolm, God destroys Crichton. Crappy sequel brings back Malcolm

someone on A.V. Club&&Wasn't he on Law and Order at some point?&&you know what... i'd actually totally dig a movie that was basically just an inquest into InGen.&&The trailer was basically a scene from the movie rather than a narrative trailer that gives a sense of the full story. I can't really even guess how far into the movie this would be? Maybe 40-45 minutes?&&This movie looks like a bummer, I don't want to watch a bunch of cool dinosaurs get killed by a volcano/drowning :|&&Exactly! I was robbed of a fantastic moment. You know what I remember from the trailer of the first Jurassic Park? A foot. That’s it’s fricken trex foot.  And I was terrified.&&what? you're saying a bunch of smoke can kill you?

> reaching speeds of up to 700 km/h (430 mph). The gases can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C (1,830 °F)

*oh*&&Thanks for reminding me what that was called. When I saw that I was like: well he's deader than shit. Of course he'll survive somehow in the movie which makes no sense at all.&&> Chris Pratt just ran through a pyroclastic flow.

So fucking dumb. &&At least in dantes peak they had to get inside a mountain&&Audience: ""Well, there it is""&&I CLAPPED BECAUSE HE SAID THE THING THAT I REMEMBER &&I'm more hyped to see some morality dialogue in a courtroom with jeff goldblum than dinosaurs causing chaos.&&https://youtu.be/iBxgAmdPQWg&&Also life finding a waying&&[Chris Pratt](https://streamable.com/b0yk4) needs to attend a Tom Cruise workshop on action running.&&Because they shouldn't have any freaking grip on most surfaces due to its shape and ultra smooth surface texture is just dumb. Plus in a jeep you can get plucked out of and eaten, so there's a sense of danger when driving around in T-Rex country. These are more or less safe until it gets kicked somewhere by some big dinosaur and they get stuck and can't get out or something. &&Me too. I was thinking ""oh at least they aren't riding in those glass balls again"" ...next shot:""aw dammit!""&&OMG I HOPE JIMMY FALLON COMES ON THE SCREEN AGAIN&&I hate the whole fucking trailer. &&I know why, for me at least. They look way too goofy and nonsensical in the midst of this super intense action sequence-thing they’re going for. Totally kills the vibe. &&I came here to say this too. I think it’s the fact that the writers thought they were so cool they had to bring them back for this movie. They’re not that cool.&&I got you fam [Here](https://youtu.be/lc3hGGXVokY)&&I need to see this version of the trailer now. &&[Official Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTZCjCYsytM)&&It was a fucking committee and focus group, you can be sure of that.&&Nah, the other guy. The guy that lives in Hell.&&Not to mention that one scene with Pratt and the raptor.  They tried to make it look like the raptor was about to go for Pratt's hand, but all I saw was it simply calling for backup or getting hit by something offscreen.&&Most of it felt like the first act and then the third act. It felt like it was missing parts from the second act.&&I agree! Don't know what it was about it, it just felt off. Might need to rewatch it a few times&&I guess Blue being alive gave Chris Pratt a reason to actually go back, I think he doesn't really care for the island other than the raptors he raised. &&“Oh awesome, I love Carnotaurus, can’t wait to see how badass it is in the movie!”

...

“Well fucking never mind then.”&&Yeah I mean what is the point of this movie going to be? They're going to go to the island to save dinosaurs and then the volcanoe explodes? And I swear to God if they bring the T-Rex to the mainland like in Lost World I'm going to slit my wrists in the theater.&&Dinosaurs had their chance, and they were selected to be rehashed in franchises for eternity. &&That Ankylosaurus falling in the water looked cool though&&Cowabunga dudes!&&I honestly think I might avoid this movie because I don't want to see dinosaurs dying, it's sad.&&[deleted]&&My deepest hope is that the scene we just saw is all the prologue to the actual movie, wherein Chris Pratt is vaporized, Bryce Dallas Howard drowns, and the several dinosaurs that are either able to safely get off the island or are taken off the island go through a difficult legal battle while being kept in a common space. They enter a sort of legal limbo, and the vast majority of the movie takes place inside the courtroom and the pens where the dinosaurs are kept.

Think ""A Few Good Men"" meets ""The Terminal"", but with dinosaurs.&&Why does everyone seem to know this dinosaur's name?&&John Hammond.&&The books cover the use of geothermal power. Probably for that.&&>Who decided to build a park on an active volcanic island?

$20 says this exact quote is in the movie. &&Isn't the whole state of Hawaii a volcano? Isn't Yellowstone just one big ticking time bomb?&&Well yeah, you didn't expect them to let a real person get that close to a raptor, did you?&&I felt like the same retouching was done in JW.  His face looks too... clean?&&[For comparisons sake. Left seems to be Phris Cratt with Chris Pratt on the right.](https://i.imgur.com/akr864a.png)&&You know what, I think it might be covering something crucial for the full release, maybe his face is supposed to be all bloodied up in that scene after being attacked by Blue or something.&&""We have to find their queen! And then get her chase a school bus!""&&I was so hyped for that movie that I read the novel that takes place between the two movies. Then the novelization of the movie came out two days before the movie and I banged it out in a day. And I was like ""ehhhhhhhhhh maybe it'll be better in the movies...""  
And it was worse. &&I originally saw this linked from Facebook and legit thought that was what this was at first.&&So glad he’s gone from Star Wars I really don’t know how he ever even got that gig&&Your comment motivated me to read [the wiki page for this movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World:_Fallen_Kingdom) and the early ideas sound more interesting than what is teased in this trailer.

>Trevorrow hinted that the next film could involve dinosaurs being used by other companies for non-entertainment purposes, possibly in agriculture, medicine, and war: ""I really like the idea that this group of geneticists aren't the only people who can make a dinosaur […] when you think of the differences between Apple and PC—the minute something goes open-source, there are all kinds of entities and interests that may be able to utilize that technology.""

> Trevorrow confirmed the film would not involve ""a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island. That'll get old real fast.""&&Soft reboot&&That was a way more interesting story.  Hammond's investors trying to harvest the dinos to get on with their plan after his failure, plus a badass hunter dude living out his dream of taking down history's greatest predator, while a bunch of animal rights activists sneak in to secretly sabotage their operation, and the dinos just fuck everyone's shit up.  At least I find that all much more engaging than 'Let's go save the dinos from a volcano and flirt.'&&I’m fairly certain I read that margarita man is actually jimmy buffet’s cameo in JW which makes it 100x better.&&You mean actual Jimmy Buffet?&&bring back barstool guy from sharknado!&&Haha, yeah he will put a big branch in his mouth and use it to steer&&Ugh...&&Or rides Bryce&&It's like when Iron Man saved the boat in Spider-Man: Homecoming. That was shown in the trailer as well. Lame.&&Good thing he's wearing his plot armor.&&I kinda love how *that's* apparently survivable but the Wall Of Cold from *The Day After Tomorrow* is not.&&I mean... we don’t see him in the water do we? Pretty sure we just watched the main character die horribly in the first trailer.&&I'm really digging the Goldblum renaissance lately &&“Hey this whole series is vaguely about technology going awry, let’s use that song from that Black Mirror episode!”&&Well, there it is&&How did it take this much scrolling to get to this? How? &&You’re watching a trailer to a sequel to a secret remake of a franchise that makes it the fifth part of the series, originally is not welcome here.&&I feel the same way.  Watching them panic and fall of the cliff was not entertaining for me.  &&I know all this trailer did was make me sad. &&My favorite dinosaur is a Triceratops. I was like ""YES! I see they have multiple Tricer....nope. Now they are having them throw themselves off the cliff to die...NOOOOO"" The better save some of those mother fucking Triceratops. &&right? i can't believe this is the best they can come up with. what a let down.&&I really hope there's more to the movie than that volcano scene.&&Just like Jurrasic World!&&looks bad, Chris Pratt running from the dust looked like something out of the Tom Cruise Mummy movie.&&Yeah, it’s one of the strangest edited trailers I’ve ever seen.&&I assume that was the point of the court scene.

&&He’s gonna come flying off the island on a dinosaur &&Yeah, I thought that bit was a little much. Would have been pretty tension filled in the theater had we not seen that part. &&Yeah that ruined what was probably going to be the ""fuck yeah Rexy!"" moment. The appearance in Jurassic World was one of the movies few good points for me and it wouldn't have been the same without the surprise.&&I'm just fucking excited they have the Carnotaurus finally in these movies. If only they had the camouflage bits from the book, but they probably won't...cause Indominus.&&I’m honestly with you. I grew up with the original Jurassic Park. That movie was just a classic. Jurassic World felt like the fast food version. 

I think my main gripe is that the message of Jurassic Park is that man does not control nature despite how confident in himself he may feel. But in Jurassic World, we saw man actually taming dinosaurs like dogs. That’s fucking lame if you ask me. The T-Rex was this huge threatening beast in Jurassic Park and then it turned into the fucking good guy in Jurassic World. In my opinion, the latest film went against everything the original set out to be.&&A bunch of people passionately debating about the ethics of what happened at Jurassic Park and World with Jeff Goldblum? Hell yeah I'd watch that. &&A lot of the cgi budget went on Jeff Goldblum's beard if I remember correctly.&&One of my favorite aspects of the original Jurassic Park is that Hammond **clearly** cut at least a few corners.

His claim that they ""spared no expense"" is challenged at least three different times in the original film, alone.

The reason shit got so out of hand is because the park **clearly** skirted a few safety measures and a few contingencies to get the park ready for profit.&&what about the ford explorers?&&People live on Hawaii... That's a chain of active volcano's&&Not surprised. The recent movie and this sequel just give a vibe of milking a franchise dry. At least back then those movies had some originality to them, now it's just flashy cgi and loud noises with a few humbling quotes thrown in.&&You're thinking too small. We need dinosaurs raining from the sky, but one so big we need a ragtag team of deep sea oil drillers to fly into space, drill into it, and blow it up.

Dinogheddon&&Get that guy who did Sharknado, he'd be all over it.&&But this time, Chris Pratt is wearing the high heels while he runs away &&Well, up until Chris Pratt gets enveloped in the [pyroclastic flow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow) and melts.

I’m sure he’s fine...&&As though anyone could possibly give a fuck about those two. One cared about his job not so much but mostly dinosaurs. The other cared not so much about the dinosaurs and mostly her job. Then they decided the best time to makeout was when pterosaurs were eating people all around them.

Great. America's favorite romantic duo! Chris Pratt Dinosaur Guy and High Heels Business Lady!&&They dont need chemistry, they are hot.&&Fun Fact: the bacteria that cause gonorrhea and bacterial meningitis are from the same genus, Neisseria &&And that rex was a nobody. This is THE trex. The OG queen of the dinos. The one and only. &&That fight was bullshit though, the Trex gets spino by the neck and somehow this doesn't kill the dinosaur.&&I hope she gets nominated. &&They also say there’s no roles for women over 40 but there is Rexy proving everyone wrong.&&T-Rex comes forward, claims Chris Pratt made unwanted advances during the filming of the new Jurassic park&&At the same time, she wasn't fighting for the humans.

She only fights carnivores who fuck with her turf. She's immediately eaten humans as well.&&Right? Saves everyone's asses all the time.&&This movie better end with Lady Rex devouring the main characters &&[deleted]&&The first one basically revealed the plot twist, I think they tried too hard to cover this one up&&Or they took all those teasers we got this week and made a full trailer out of them.&&I posted this elsewhere but I guess it's appropriate here too:

I feel like the mistake this trailer makes is to showcase stuff that made JW weak. It opens with the god awful unnecessary romantic subplot (A), and then the majority of the trailer is spent with elaborate largely and noticeably CG creatures and backdrops (B). Then the trailer kinda just ends with those two negative qualities that imo plagued the first film.

They even play the Rexy as a superhero card *again* in the same trailer. They make it seem like they didn't learn anything from JW and that is worrisome.

Oh well, at least we have that awesome BTS reel instead. Somehow I feel like they released *that* for those of us who they know wouldn't really enjoy this trailer as much as they maybe expected the general blockbuster audience would.&&Did they go too fast? They went too fast. They did a flyby.&&$$ Bro. First one was a mega hit, had the record for biggest opening weekend ever before Stars Wars beat it last yr&&Both books mention volcanic activity including the park running on geothermal power. Since it's been years after JW it makes sense that the volcano could reawaken &&There's a TON of fan service so I guess they're banking on nostalgia.&&Aside from new genetically altered dinos, JW wasn't really fresh. It too felt like an unnecessary sequel...&&Not me, I thought it finally went well for once. &&did they ever explain why the pterodactyls don't just fly over to nearby south America.. even for just a brief moment?&&Oh wow, I'd actually forgotten Malcolm died in JP. &&Crappy sequel flops...

Malcolm inherits the earth..   &&He did a season or two of Law & Order: Criminal Intent. He played Detective Jeff Goldblum. &&I hope this is in the first 30 minutes and what we didn't see was a giant rock, expelled from the volcanic explosion, impaling the T-Rex. 

The stakes need to be high(er) and if that means having them escape from an exploding, lava ridden, dinosaur killing island for the rest of the movie then I'm all for it.&&To put it in perspective, when Mt. Pelee released  a pyroclastic flow in 1902 that blasted through St. Pierre - every. single. person. died. (in the city proper). All 28,000 people. 

Except one - a prisoner in an underground bunker. irony at work&&He gets lung cancer and dies 30 years later.

Edit: HEEEEEEE&&Well Indiana Jones survived a nuke by hiding in a refrigerator.......&&Goddamit Chris Pratt, get your shit together.&&Man this movie kicked ass. And it came out around the same time as Volcano, which was just awful shit and a kids tv show by comparison.

Also, nice job on getting it out so soon.&&Yeah we're just gonna have to go ahead and throw that trailer away. This is something we can all get behind. &&https://youtu.be/clU0Sh9ngmY&&I'm guessing it's all the first act. They're in an animal rights rescue mission apparently that seems to be decided in court. They're there with lots of gear and people. The series is about a handful of people surviving on their own, cut off from real help/civilization and that fall in the water most likely is the start of their little adventure&&I think there was no flow to it. It starts off with a character moment, jump straight to the island, quick random shots, then a huge chunk of the trailer focuses on ONE particular scene....that volcanic eruption and the dinosaurs/characters running from it. **Seriously, almost half of the trailer was showing us an actual extended (yet edited) clip from the film. It was kind of jarring.** 

It didn’t even have the classic Jurassic Park theme in all its glory! You’d think the fifth movie would make the theme stand out in the trailer. One of the best moments of the Avengers Infinity War trailer was the epic Avengers theme playing at the end. &&The music seemed off to me too. Like the score seemed to build up tension with no release.&&Exactly, Chris Pratt character was the one that in the original cared for the dinosaurs and Claire is trying to persuade him to save them, using blue, the one that saved him once (while I believe she has her own not so good motives to want to do it) &&oh god i think you just predicted act 4&&Hollywood, uh, finds a way.&&If I was to create a movie about condors on this island, you wouldn't have anything to say.&&Yeah but theres no way that poor guy can swim :(&&The Jurassic movies are popular because every kid at some point had a ""dinosaur phase"" where they had a shitton of toy dinosaurs and knew all the names and the movies play to that nostalgia. At no point does watching all my favorite dinosaurs getting obliterated by a pyroclastic flow or slowly drowned trigger that warm nostalgia feeling.&&I believe her last location was an isolated lagoon, so probably not going to happen.&&Go on.&&The Carnotaurus played a role in the second Jurassic Park novel, The Lost World. [It wasn't a HUGE role...it never had any direct interaction with the human characters, but it had the ability to camouflage like the Indominus in Jurassic World and was fearsome enough to scare off raptors.](#spoiler) So fans of the book series have been waiting for it to show up for a while.&&Because the Carnotaurus is an awesome carnivore. Horns, bony skin protrusions, vestigial arms, and not to mention the trademark short, bulldog-y snout. They've been in pop culture a while, but usually on the fringe. They were also in the second Jurassic Park novel.&&I play Ark&&Popularity from the Disney's ""Dinosaur"" movie.&&We, uh, may have spared some expenses.&&There's geothermal spots everywhere, doesn't mean there's a threat of an erupting volcano.&&Hollywood was drunk on all that Jurassic World box office.

Edit: This one.

Dr. Ian Malcolm: Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me.

Donald Gennaro: Well thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different then you and I had feared...

Dr. Ian Malcolm: Yeah, I know. They're a lot worse.

Donald Gennaro: Now, wait a second now, we haven't even seen the park...

John Hammond: No, no, Donald, Donald, Donald... let him talk. There's no reason... I want to hear every viewpoint, I really do.

Dr. Ian Malcolm: Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.

Donald Gennaro: It's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations...

Dr. Ian Malcolm: If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now
[bangs on the table]
You're selling it, you wanna sell it. Well...

John Hammond: I don't think you're giving us our due credit. Our scientists have done things which nobody's ever done before...

Dr. Ian Malcolm: Yeah, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they *should.*

John Hammond: Condors. *Condors* are on the verge of extinction...

Dr. Ian Malcolm: [shaking his head] No...

John Hammond: If I was to create a flock of condors on this island, you wouldn't have anything to say.

Dr. Ian Malcolm: No, hold on. This isn't some species that was obliterated by deforestation, or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot, and nature selected them for extinction.

John Hammond: I simply don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. I mean, how can we stand in the light of discovery, and not act?

Dr. Ian Malcolm: What's so great about discovery? It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores. What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.

Dr. Ellie Sattler: Well, the question is, how can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem? And therefore, how could you ever assume that you can control it? I mean, you have plants in this building that are poisonous, you picked them because they look good, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in, and they'll defend themselves, violently if necessary.

John Hammond: Dr. Grant, if there's one person here who could appreciate what I'm trying to do...

Dr. Alan Grant: The world has just changed so radically, and we're all running to catch up. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look... Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?

John Hammond: [laughing] I don't believe it. I don't believe it! You're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters, and the only one I've got on my side is the blood-sucking lawyer!

Donald Gennaro: Thank you.&&Then at the end of the movie the island blows up and all of it was a waste of time.
&&And he didnt want to pay the only dude who knew how the computer system worked...&&No expense was spared&&Also Iceland.&&And the way the t-rex bites the smaller dino right at the last second is pretty much right out of the original movie.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RZi6NCuLbQ&&please god&&I'm betting a raptor picks him up, and he comes riding out of the cloud on its back.&&The George Lucas method &&That wasn't fun.&&Her name is Rexy!&&I personally like to believe that the JP3 Rex was the infant from TLW. &&I can't remember, did they explain why she and the rest of the first movie's dinosaurs didn't die from lack of lysine after a couple days?&&To be fair, that was a lawyer. Lawyers are often compared to animals that have reptilian traits, as are dinosaurs, despite not actually being lizards.

T-Rex is just a sister with no name who is trying to save humans from scaly, carnivorous threats.&&Now I want the jurassic ____ movies to just have the main characters get in more and more ridiculously precarious situations, only to have that same T-Rex show up at the last second to save them in various zany ways

Edit: [Suffer ](https://youtu.be/KcIfDp-S72M)&&Except for Chris Pratt. They become buds and ride off into the sunset together. &&I'd imagine the film would still carry over the idea of militarized dinos from the previous one.  Perhaps the dinos getting evacuated are secretly going to be shipped to a military facility that Dr. Wu is in charge of, maybe for further breeding or more hybrids.  And when the protagonists find out, they break out the dinos from their cages and stuff just like Vince Vaughn did in Lost World.

 But what I don't get is why go through the danger of taking dinosaurs from Isla Nublar during a volcanic eruption.  Couldn't they just go to Isla Sorna, Site B?  JW never mentioned that island, I hope this movie does.  Either Site B is also in danger from the volcano, or the Spinosaurus from JP3 ate everything (as it was bred in secret, as implied by Grant in that movie)&&The dinosaurs intentionally made the volcano go off to have a crew get them to the continental United States for a takeover.&&Yea but JW made over a $billion so of course they're gonna double down on that shit. Blockbusters are made more for Chinese audiences now.&&It's written by the same guy who directed and revised the script for JW, Colin Trevorrow. He is a proven hack when it comes to film, and the only reason he's even relevant in regards to this property is because no matter *who* wrote/directed JW, they would've had a successful hit on their hands because of the nostalgia factor. 

This movie is still going to make a nice bit of change, but it's still going to suck. Calling it now: 55-65% on Rotten Tomatoes, 40-50% on MetaCritic. It's going to be a CGI-fest with zero character substance, much like the trailer.&&This is the only answer that matters. They give zero fucks if the movie is good or not. Put a bunch of CGI dinos on screen. Sprinkle in some chris Pratt. Slap ""Jurassic whatever"" on the poster. Profit. &&And they didn't think to...foreshadow this at least in Jurassic World? Not even a mention? I didn't even realize there was a potential active volcano ON the island.&&They got all my nostalgia last time, so they can’t really sell me personally on that front.&&JW gave us the Park actually working as it was intended to. Something I really wanted to see.



This shit looks like it could’ve come out alongside the original Jurassic Park sequels 15 years ago.&&Would actually make for a more interesting movie at this point. &&The next movie after Fallen Kingdom is just a two-hour mockumentary *a la* Planet Earth about the dinosaurs living peacefully once they're free from the confines that humans created.&&In the book...   not the movie&&I was about to call bull but then... yeah, forgot that in the book Malcolm died and then Crichton retconned him back in. 

Side note, I did enjoy the second Jurassic Park book. Much more than the second movie anyway.&&And it was amazing because Jeff Goldblum is Jeff Goldblum.&&Holy shit imagine being that dude emerging among the wreckage.&&There were other survivors (via wikipedia):  

> The only other survivors in the town were Léon Compère-Léandre, a shoemaker whose house was on the very edge of the pyroclastic flow, and a young girl called Havivra Da Ifrile, who ran from the lava, got into a boat and survived when it was washed out to sea.
&&That's cool that you're in the movie too.&&The movie was written while the writers were drinking shots.&&Stupid Crisp Rat&&Audience: *sigh, shakes head* ""I really love that man""&&[deleted]&&YOU BROKE NEW GROUND &&A cat, uh... grows claws!&&Extremely hydrophobic coating?&&All the dinosaurs are girls. Girls don't poop.


Not an issue.&&[deleted]&&Yeah I'll pay $12 to watch a movie with Goldbloom laughing over everyone's dialog. &&The one with the raptor and Pratt was super hilarious&&It seems like it's going to be an obvious retelling of the same plot from The Lost World. Go in to rescue the dinos, meet second team with the same goal but opposing view point, dinos get loose in populated area. This time it'll be militarized dinos getting lose instead of one t-rex. &&Like, there's no way that that's the climax of this movie, right? They showed wayyyy too much of what seemed like a pretty cool scene regardless of where it lies. &&The fucking music. Or lack of music. Literally three notes played by the strings (listen at [1:36](https://youtu.be/vn9mMeWcgoM?t=96)). It's heard across ALL OF THESE FUCKING TRAILERS. 

Compare to John Williams' original score:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEZh88vz8b8

Now we get Bb->A->Bb like they could only afford to pay the composer for one measure of music. I think it's attempting to riff off of [this part of the original theme](https://youtu.be/oEZh88vz8b8?t=111) but holy shit it's not even close.&&I like how no one recognizes that Chris Pratt’s character actually has a name. It’s just Chris Pratt. &&I expected it to show that in the trailer when Goldbloom said ""finds a way""  
Just hard cut at that final line to a bunch if Dinos swarming into a city.&&No, they're actually famous for the fossils always being found on their backs. They fall in the water and can't swim&&Actually in ARK they are surprisingly strong swimmers&&Jeff Golblum plays a star witness for the prosecution, which doesn't want to allow the dinosaurs into the country, but B.D. Wong plays the star witness for the defense, a particular corporation that wants to allow the dinosaurs in for continued testing and experimentation.

Following an arduous legal battle, the dinosaurs are allowed into the country. We **then** discover that the plans for the dinosaurs are based on grants provided by government *military* contracts, as I believe was eluded to in the first Jurassic World.

Learning of this, Golblum and his rag-tag bunch of anti-dinosaur brethren break *in* to the facility where the dinosaurs are being kept. They inadvertently trigger an alarm, which has them beset upon by crazed, militarized dinosaurs. This culminates in a 1-on-1 showdown between Jeff Golblum and a velociraptor, but this time Jeff has what he believes is a full proof advantage; an exosuit ALA Aliens, with fully loaded weaponry. 

BUT, just as he believes he has the advantage, a laser guided missile system emerges from the dinosaurs back. Shocked, Jeff Golbulm is pushed back in his exosuit. He's on the ropes, there's no way he's going to survive... 

BAM, MOTHERFUCKING T-REX TO THE RESCUE, BITCHES! THOUGHT THAT SHIT WAS DEAD ON THE FUCKING VOLCANO, HUH!? HELL NO!

GOLBLUM BLOWS UP THE FACILITY, CREDITS&&Yep. I believe even the T-Rex was a little skittish passing through their territory, it pretty much ran in, musked/marked up a Jeep full of people, and ran off. Like when a bunch of dogs take turns pissing on the same bush like, ""NO IT'S MINE.""

They -did- actually interact with it, though. The whole gas station sequence, they scared it off with the flash-light by forcing it to constantly change its camo to adapt to the changing lighting until it got anxious.

Then the dust clears and a bit later we get a big reveal of the rest of the cast stumbling across the burned ash coated body, and you hear some kind of muffled yell.

Then everyone is super shocked as you hear a clearer yell while they freak out and pry open the mouth to get him out. Immediately after big bad dino #2 shows up (the real bad guy of the film) but now the rex can't save them again, so they have to run and never address how the fuck the other thing survived the ash and super heated pyroclastic flow.&&The stealthiest animal to ever roam the planet.&&To Kill a Pterodactyl.&&I read the book when I was in 7th grade right before the movie came out.  I remember more of the movie now than the book but I really think this sums up what Crichton was saying and what is the most profound concept of the franchise.  It's also why I think each new movie doesn't really offer anything unique although they are entertaining.&&This is what made the first one so great.  It felt real and asked important questions.  This was my least favorite scene as a kid, but my favorite one now.  Truly science-fiction.  The new movies are just dinosaur action orgasms made to sell tickets...&&It's amazing how when this film came out 25 or so years ago, to the first grader watching it, this was the boring scene at the beginning you had to sit through to get to the dinosaurs eating people. Now as an adult, it's the standout scene of the film.&&[Do we have the clip? Let’s go to the clip.](https://youtu.be/4PLvdmifDSk)&&There was no sparing of expenses&&Indonesia &&Almost exactly like what happened in the first reboot when the water dinosaur attacked the other.

Still tho. T. rex.&&So a T-Rex, Starlord and a raptor with blue streaks walk into a bar&&Transportation must be hard though, seeing they've gone full primal. Good point!&&> But what I don't get is why go through the danger of taking dinosaurs from Isla Nublar during a volcanic eruption. 

Maybe the eruption got triggered by something or happened earlier than expected. I bet they thought they had plenty of time to get the dinos off the island and as they lollygag and go at a chill pace the eruption happens and causes chaos and scrambling.

I bet two kids go off exploring the island because they totally bring kids with them on a dangerous mission like this.  they go behind the ""Do not enter. Warning. Danger. volcano inside!"" area and decide to throw dynamite into it because why not? and that causes the movie to happen. &&Wow. Vince Vaughn was in The Lost World. &&Would've been the easiest throw away line to place. Just have someone mention a report of the ""geothermal power planet issue to due to a lava spike that that is under control""&&They probably weren't planning that far ahead. &&But..But..but Jeff Goldblum says his line!&&> JW gave us the Park actually working as it was intended to. Something I really wanted to see.

Except they completely wasted it. 

They spent the majority of the time in the jungle, the park guests didn't even SEE the Indominus Rex (let alone know it existed) and as soon as they're attacked by the Pterodactyls, the park is evacuated.

I can see it now. The “other team” will be led by Anti-Crisp Rat, another roguishly handsome young dude who will flirt with BDH (probably be the ex-bf she talks about in the trailer), adding another layer to why Crisp Rat goes against logic and releases the Dinos on the mainland.  &&Apparently there’s another hybrid dinosaur thing running around.

Goldbulm:""but not today!""

BLAMO!&&OP delivered. Fuckin’ take my upvote, and a beer if we ever meet IRL.&&Yes, I do remember that. What I meant was that they didn't actually attack or kill anyone. Though now that I think about it, I actually think it may have been implied that Diego was killed by one at the beginning of the book and Levine was attacked by one. I always read it as a raptor attack, but now that I think about it, it may have been implied somewhere that it was a Carnotaurus. &&Those guys scared the crap out of me in that movie.

YOU HAD ONE JOB HOLLYWOOD.&&Except stay married&&Unless there's a glass of water nearby.&&A few good claws&&That was Crichton's thing when it came to sci-fi. His books were generally about what's hot in the technology/scientific fields, and questioned the ethics/dangers of those things. He did in Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, Congo (to an extent), Prey, and less impressively State of Fear.&&Jurassic World felt specifically like it was meant to appeal to kids. Jurassic Park on the other hand I think appealed to all ages. I loved it as a kid, because there were dinosaurs, and they seemed totally alive. As an adult I love it for the same reasons, but also for the serious tone and believable characters. Jurassic World I liked more as a nostalgia kind of thing, but the dinosaurs in the movie all looked horribly fake (I think someone made a YouTube video explaining why this happened) and the parts of the movie focusing on just the two kids made me feel like I was watching an episode of Goosebumps or something (One Day in Jurassic Horror Land) and most of the characters were entirely unbelievable. Chris Pratt in particular was very much stereotypical movie hero guy.

I don’t really know where the franchise is going, but I don’t particularly like it. Things seem way too kid friendly and inspired by the sort of comedic action adventure movies of the Marvel universe. The ethical questions of JW seemed kind of glossed over and they did not stand out like that fore mentioned JP scene were Ian Malcolm is tearing into Hammond for what he’s doing. &&No spare was expensed&&I can see Mt. St. Helens from my house.&&It also happens in Star Wars: Episode one.. albeit underwater.

They hid it from marketing until after release.&&Is the Raptor's name Mary Poppins Y'all?&&and there's also the reasoning behind Claire's willingness to return to the island.  Aside from being a main character that goes for the sake of plot, I can't imagine why she'd be involved.  She looked at the dinosaurs as ""assets"" and cared more about profits than seeing her nephews and people's lives.  If they were smart, they'd give the character a secret agenda that she hides from Pratt, like the idea of militarizing the dinos left on the island&&Yeah, like, even something like that.

Again, the fact that I didn't even KNOW there was a volcano on the island is kind of a bad sign of writing. (Not to mention bad world building).&&And the T-Rex says his too!&&He says it, but he doesn’t sell it. His delivery seemed pretty meh to me, as though he was bored. He definitely sounded more invested in his Thor Ragnarok role, which gives me the impression that he’s just in this for fan service and won’t be much of a supporting character. &&And they kill the only interesting actor in a throwaway gag to release the pterodactyls.  So they have any reason at all to show the guests again.

There's a white Australian acting as a black American. There's a super masculine rapper who's actually homosexual or bi. There's Jack Black. And Tugg Speedman is every over the hill action hero as acted by Ben Stiller, who wrote and directed the movie. 

I can't think of any comedy that has this many oars in the water, so to speak, both comedically, satirically, and also as a mockery of Hollywood itself. ","> There's a white Australian acting as a black American.

At one point, it's actually a white American actor playing a white Australian actor playing a black American soldier playing a Vietnamese farmer.&&""there is jack black"". That makes it sounds like jack black only can play jack black in movies and that's hilarious.&&The fact that Robert Downey Jr. got nominated for an oscar for this movie is hysterical too lol&&The facial expressions and dead eye stares that Robert Downey Jr. throws around after some of his lines is enough for me to keep it on every time I come across it.&&The satire of Hollywood is perfect. From the 'trailers' that open the movie and every actor nailing a perfect Hollywood stereotype it just hits all the right notes.

As for best quote; ""I'm a lead farmer, mother fucker""&&Matthew McConaughey as the agent focused on the pampering of his star client poked fun at the spoiled brat image of stars and those that enable it.&&You never go full retard.

RDJ is spot on perfection in that movie.

&&I just saw this with the cast commentary and RDJ switching from his Lincoln voice to an Australian accent in the commentary was the funniest thing I've seen all year.&&I want a scene for scene remake of Fury with the cast of Tropic Thunder so much.&&""First, take a big step back... and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE!""&&For your information, my revenue stream currently generates 2 million a year in charitable contributions for my community.

It's up there with Caddyshack and Anchorman.  I hope Ben Stiller gets back to directing another original ^(key ^word, ^there) comedy soon, he does a great job at getting a great cast and using them well&&Come on dude... you more shredded than a Julienne salad, man&&Nobody gonna mention Danny Mcbride.

But once he realized he dropped character he tries to transition back to it and I clinically died of laughter.&&""I can't think of any comedy that has this many oars in the water, so to speak, both comedically, satirically, and also as a mockery of Hollywood itself.""





Blazing Saddles&&HEY. What do you mean *""you people""*?&&I laughed really hard when tugg held up the directors head like it was a fake stage prop and the guys in the jungle thought he was insane. Too good&&I remember watching this movie and my first thought was RDJr deserves at least an Oscar Nomination for this

My second one was Holy Shit that was Tom Cruise !!

Such a great comedy no way they can do a sequel of this masterpiece &&I need to watch this.  I've seen clips but never the entire movie. &&Suck my unit&&The real question is...










Where can I buy me some Booty Sweat?&&One of my favorite Robert Downy Jr. movies! A white actor doing black face could have gone *very* wrong, but RDJ made it work and it really shows what a talent he is!

""I don't drop character till i do a dvd commentary"" LOL love it!&&> Someone help me out here. There are multiple levels to the film: It's a movie, of course, about making a fictional movie which happens to actually be the movie. Which is based on a book which turns out to be all lies... It has a play within the movie of a fake movie within the movie. 

You're almost describing Adaptation.&&Fun fact: The first thing you see in the film was the last thing that was filmed.

The booty sweat video...  The day before Thanksgiving... at 3am. Yay Hollywood.

Source: I worked on Tropic Thunder&&This is probably one of my favorite comedy movies. I absolutely love Robert Downey Jr. as he plays Kirk Lazarus. One of his best roles in my opinion. &&There will honestly never be another movie like it. That cast was fucking genius.&&Gilding this for Tropic Thunder love. My favorite comedy along with The Dictator but yes it’s completely perfect. Don’t forget that RDJ is an American playing an Australian playing an American. The trailers in the beginning slay me every time. 

WHERE THOSE JELLYBEANS AT?

Edit: forgot to mention, one time I saw Ben Stiller at a party and he refused taking photos with people. When I walked up to him and raved about Tropic Thunder he smiled and told me it meant a lot to him because he feels that he never gets enough credit for it - and I got a great photo with him!&&Agreed. I think this and Hot Fuzz are perfect movies. I mention Hot Fuzz because it takes notes from 80s/90s action movies and references those movies in the film. &&Tropic Thunder might be my favorite movie of all time barring LotR. There are so many subtle gags and multiple levels of humor to each scene, and the cast is amazing. I died with laughter when Nick Nolte was on the beach and saying something incomprehensable to the director, and he's listening and agreeing and then an an awkward ""...what?"" It really is a perfect comedy. I can't believe it's been almost 10 years!&&Oh fully agreed! This is a fantastic movie and one the funniest original satirical comedies I've seen in years.&&The trailers at the beginning set the tone of the movie, all while providing perfect background information for each character/Actor. Both hilarious and added so much depth. And  cruise to maconaughey both add a lot with their roles. 

This also came out in what was a truly great era for the genre. One of my favorites. &&Robert downie jrs best performance ever. 


Hands down funniest role ever played, and Robert fucking nailed it. &&Best movie about Hollywood, for sure. Tom Cruise's finest performance, imo.&&Bill Simmons old ESPN website Grandland did a great oral history piece on Cruise's character in Tropic Thunder. Titled ""The Making of Les Grossman"", it's a worthwhile read with multiple studio execs, producers, co-stars which discuss Cruise, his role and his approach at this later point in his career / for this film. 

You can find the 2015 article here: http://grantland.com/features/the-making-of-les-grossman-an-oral-history/&&I went to film school and one of my favorite professors and I were discussing possible subjects for a class of his next semester. While I always respected his opinion, we very different taste in movies.

However, when he brought up the topic of teaching a class on “war movies”, I immediately brought up the concept of showing Tropic Thunder as an intro, or the first movie the class would watch together (I had seen it recently). 

I remember he smacked his desk and said, “Holy shit, I had the same idea. How fucking great is that movie? ‘Never go full retard!’”&&How could you forget the best part?

I'm gonna need you to take a step back and literally

# FUCK YOUR OWN FACE

^(*sidenote: hilariously, my mobile keyboard auto predicted that bit*)  &&Because of this thread I'm rewatching it. lol

""From Fox Searchlight...5 time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus...
and MTV Movie Award Best Kiss winner Tobey Maguire."" LOL


And it's even funnier because the Tobey M. best kiss award is real!&&[deleted]&&""DON'T JUDGE ME! ""&&The scene where the director steps on the land mine cracked me all the way up.  Wasn't expecting it on my first watch.&&But it's an American that's pretending to be a white Australian acting as a black American.&&Tom Cruise killed it in that movie.  Loved his scenes.  I lose it every time Bill Hader says, ""Welcome to the goodie room!"".&&Did you notice when Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) was pissing and Kirk Lazarus (RDJ) comes up and starts talking to him he also starts pissing.

Then Tugg Speedman (Stiller) comes up, he can't start peeing so he pours some of the pussy juice out to make it sound and look like he is peeing.&&I'M A LEAD FARMER, MOTHERFUCKER!&&He's a dude playing as a dude disguised as another dude!&&Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for an Oscar for this role. I just think that's crazy given how rediculous his character really is. For his character to be funny, he really had to do a great job. I know an Academy Award/nomination is not always indicative of good quality, but his role really provides a lot of laughter throughout the movie, and it wouldn't work with a mediocre acting job.&&What's hilarious is when he's trying to convince the other asian guys that he's a farmer, he can't hold back his african american affect and throws his arms and says ""I diversify"", but you only see it quickly from a side angle.  I can't stop laughing every time I watch that scene.&&I mean, it's that for most of the movie, considering RDJ is American.&&If you watch it with the commentary on RDJ does it in,character. And then changes his,character accordingly when it changes on screen.  Jack black and Ben stiller are on it as well.  Solid commentary.&&One of the most understatedly talented things an actor could do is play a character who is in turn playing another character. For example, [Mel Blanc](https://youtu.be/1G8Xlx7dfT8) once did a Looney Tunes cartoon where he voices Bugs Bunny impersonating Daffy Duck, AND Daffy Duck impersonating Bugs Bunny. That scene in the link is basically “voice acting porn”&&At the Oscars that year, Hugh Jackman delivered this little tidbit on RDJ's nomination for best supporting actor

""The Academy loves range. Kate Winslet is here tonight. She's an English woman who played a German woman. Nominated. Robert Downey Jr. is here also. An American who played an Australian who played an African-American. Nominated. Whereas I who am an Australian who played an Australian in a movie called Australia. Hosting.""

Never fails to make me laugh&&A dude playin a dude disguised as another dude&&Well he did just kill playing a teenage girl in jumanji. &&If t ain't broke don't fix it.&&Well...&&The Fatties trailer in the beginning is hilarious for multiple reasons.

For one, it has potty humor (and who doesn't love potty humor?).

But it also pokes fun at the American Public for elevating such low brow humor, because this type of movie has been made before into a successful franchise (Nutty Professor).

Even in the movie they call the Fatties ""wildly popular"", just like the Nutty Professor irl; just in the movie they turn it up to 11 to show how easy that humor is, and how easily entertained America is.

It's beautiful. A fake movie parodying a real franchise to show that low effort can produce high profits because people are dumb and laugh at fart jokes. I feel pretentious even writing this but it's so meta and I love it.&&“They only love me for my farts.”&&https://imgur.com/BDi2IEc&&It's not to say he didn't deserve it, but the Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"" that year was completely wrapped up by Heath Ledger almost immediately when the announcement came out.&&the part where he’s pretending to be a Vietnamese farmer was too good. it wasn’t like RDJ was pretending to be the farmer, he was pretending to be an australian pretending to be a black man pretending to be vietnamese. somehow he incorporates all three characters into one mess and i love it&&Can you imagine if he did the acceptance speech in blackface/Lazarus character. Holy shit, the drama. Edit: yeah I get the context of RDJs character&&SURVIVE!&&Had The Dark Knight come out a year before or later, RDJ would have an Oscar right now. I'm serious.&&It reminds me of in Zoolander how Ben Stiller makes a hilarious little facial movement after every line of dialogue, it never stops!!&&'i'm just like a little boy... Playin with his dick when he's nervous.'&&Yes! Exactly what I came here to say. [This one line in particular](https://youtu.be/SwkCXz_Kohs?t=4m24s) always has me rolling. His manic grin followed by his intense stare is absolutely golden. I honestly think he flubbed his line and couldn't help but crack a smile and it makes it so much better.&&My vote's for the Tom Cruise dialogue.

> Okay Flaming Dragon, fuckface. First, take a big step back... and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE! Now I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Asia Jack, is my territory. So whatever you're thinking, you'd better think again! Otherwise I'm gonna have to head down there and I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you! You're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you. I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker! I will massacre you! I WILL FUCK YOU UP&&Another thing that struck me last time I watched it was how perfectly the main cast played a stereotype that fit them on the surface but simulataneously contrasted the real actors.

Jack Black may have a niche as a goofy comic character actor, but he's not a shallow hedonist.

Robert Downey Jr. re-booted his career as a serious actor, but he's never been a pretentious DDL-wannabe.

Similarly Jay Baruchel, while working as the ""straight man"" trope, is mostly known for stoner comedies - where his character here is subtly ""above"" all the wacky antics.

It's like another layer of meta humour in the casting. Such a clever film! &&Don’t forget the awesome mockumentary that came with the DVD too!&&A bold statement, bold. I'd like to counter with ""Man, you never go full retard. Ask Sean Penn, 2001, 'I am Sam.' Went full retard, went home empty handed.""&&Seeing it in the theaters when it came out was the best. No idea those trailers were gonna happen.&&>As for best quote; ""I'm a lead farmer, mother fucker""

See, I'm preferential to, ""BIG ASS TITTIES!"" (Explosion)&&Why don't you take a step back AND LITERALLY FUCK YOUR OWN FACE!!!!&&Thank you! Every time someone mentions this movie, I laugh and say ""I'm a lead farmer, mother fucker!"" Then they look at me confused, I say, ""You know, from the movie...?"" and then they say they don't remember that line in the movie. I thought I somehow picked out the least memorable line from the movie and made it hilarious in my mind or something. Was beginning to think I was losing it &&That's the theme song to The Jefferson's!&&Try saying ""I'm a rooster illusion"" randomly to a coworker one day. Then take a mental snapshot of their facial reaction, because the look on their face will be funny until the day you die.&&Don’t forget Matthew McConaughey as the agent. He was amazing. &&- I killed one, Rick. The thing I love most in the world.

Man, don’t scare me like that!&&~~Fun~~ Movie fact, Owen Wilson was supposed to play that character but he had that break down and McConaughey stepped in to take his place. &&I love how he saves everyone at the end with the Tivo&&At least you get to pick yours...&&I think this might be the most underrated role in the movie.  It's almost a love story within, and dont forget the TIVO saved everyone's life on that chopper.  &&I love how his character knows exactly what to do on how to handle dead bodies. It's like a reference to American Psycho.&&Also when he runs off into the jungle like a bat out of hell is one of my favorite parts in the movie&&It still blows my mind that RDJ played blackface so well they nominated him for an Oscar because of it. He's just that good.&&Add the fact that he did the entire DVD commentary in character.&&Dustin Hoffman in Rainman? Autistic, but not full retard. &&“Still not enough? Remember Sean Penn, I Am Sam. Went full retard, went home empty handed. Never go full retard.”&&For some reason the for tv edit of that line, ""You never go full special,"" always cracks me up. Probably wouldn't if I didn't know the original, but it's one of the few tv line edits that isn't completely dumb.&&Much of my professional and volunteer life has been in disability rights and that scene always leads to some arguments. Some folks don’t like the use of the word retard as a pejorative in any context but I think the use here is actually warranted. The characters aren’t knowledgeable about or hostile towards people with disabilities and the whole point of the scene is to criticize Hollywood for using disability as a prop to create drama and “award-winning” performances.  Moreover, Hollywood, for the most part, is only willing to reward sanitized or easily digestible depictions of disability and doesn’t appear interested in giving actors in with disabilities opportunities for those kinds of roles. It wasn’t a subtle scene by any stretch and probably went on a hair longer than necessary but in a comedy movie criticizing the industry I think it worked well. &&Ben Stiller is also magic in this scene. When RDJ starts talking, Stiller’s eyes are questioning. But when RDJ says “you really don’t know” and starts the full retard monologue, Stiller’s eyes subtly change to fear. 

I remember the controversy about using the word “retard” before the film came out. There were calls to cut the scene. But the entire movie hinges on this explanation, which isn’t about mocking the disabled, it tells Stiller the one thing he didn’t know about Hollywood and that has killed his career. After this Stiller is redeemed. &&I don't drop character till the DVD commentary. &&""Wait till you see it.""

Superbad came out the same year. 

Arguably 21 Jump Street is a classic and 22 because of [this](https://youtu.be/sQCfWXoMLi0) scene, but yeah still based off an existing tv show.

Mel Blanc was freaking awesome.

In this vein, I'd also give props to Tatiana Maslany in Orphan Black.  Not only for playing a half a dozen characters, but from time to time, there's a scene where one clone is acting as another.  She handles it quite well.&&Jim Lahey in Trailer Park Boys was a master of acting drunk. In one season, his character pretended to be drunk while being sober the whole time. In another season, his character was acting sober and dry while secretly being shitfaced.&&My single favorite scene in the entire Harry Potter series is when you have Helena Bonham Carter having to perform as Emma Watson's Hermione pretending to be Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix.

Watching it I originally I actually thought they just had Emma Watson do the role and just used really good makeup and/or CG to make her look like Bonham Carter, that's how good she was in that scene.
&&I think tropic thunder and jumanji are his best roles, he kills it in both movies.&&Fr I saw the movie yesterday and Jack Black did amazing as playing a teenage girl.

There is just something so special in the sheer indignation of that delivery.

This is *flaming* DRAGON!&&big dick playaaa&&I’ve got a theory on the dancing scene. 
  
Stiller said that Cruise asked to do it. Stiller was bemused, but was like “sure... ok...” and was kinda laughing at him, rather than with. If you rewind a few months, Cruise was on Oprah, and as the end credits rolled, he was dancing in the background. Proper white guy at a wedding dancing. And he got mocked pretty hard. My theory is that he spent some time learning some dance moves and couldn’t wait to put them in a movie. &&Tom's performance during that scene, including the dancing, was entirely his own idea. Tom knew what the character needed to be.

Cruise is a less than tolerable human, but a phenomenal actor. &&WTF! I never realized this. His name is LITERALLY Grossman! He's a fat, hairy Hollywood producer with anger issues named Grossman. My mind is blowing in so many pieces right now. &&yeah after rewatching it recently i was amazed at just how apparent it is that les grossman is harvey weinstein&&Hate to break up the revisionist circle jerk but it was largely based on a different producer Joel Silver&&Michael Cera is so good in that. “Sippy time.”&&I should give that that movie another shot.

Because he doesn’t drop character til he done the DVD commentary.  Voiced by what suppose to be Justin Theroux’s Jacques Cousteau-esque french documentarian.

I would pay good money to watch a movie full of Les.&&> Also Tom's idea. 

Harvey Weinstein could sue Tom for plagerism.    Comically big hands.   Half beard.   Epic foul mouthed rants.  Cruise was method acting Weinstein.

&&This is my favorite conspiracy on Reddit. &&Oh shit, that is a very Tom Cruise thing to do. It did ding his image as uptight perfectionist. But of course he would fix that in such an upright perfectionist way.

I mean, the rumors are that he gets his girlfriends arranged and slightly altered to specifications (Nazanin Boniadi).&&I had heard before the movie that Cruise had a reputation for being a good dancer though. Apparently he likes to go clubbing.&&No.  Everyone knows Jamie Foxx taught him how to dance then took his woman Katie Holmes. &&""I want fat hands, and I wanna dance!""&&I gained a lot of respect for him when he was on a red carpet and a man threw some liquid in his face or something similar. Tom quickly grabbed his arm as the person tried to run away, and he said “Don’t run away. Why would you do that? Why would you do that?” I just liked the way he handled the situation. He didn’t give the person a free pass, and he showed poise as well.&&Lol many people pointed this out when the movie came out. It’s totally Harvey Weinstein. Everyone knew what he was all about.

They literally hired on a black actor yet didn't give him the black character's role, and he calls this out, especially when Lazarus goes into full stereotype mode. 

>""You're *Australian...*  be Australian! Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.""

And Chino himself looked to be a full on rapper stereotype who was just taking the role for exposure and money, and then he points out

>""For your information, my 'revenue stream' currently generates 2 million dollars a year in charitable contributions for my community.""

So he turns out to be the only one there for not-completely-selfish reasons. And the scene where they figure out he's gay/bi is just genius.

'Kingsman 3' Already In the Works with Director Matthew Vaughn,27770,7jft8p,https://www.cbr.com/kingsman-3-confirmed-director-matthew-vaughn-returning/,1685,1513129535.0,,"The 2nd one would've been better if they introduced Whiskey's beef with druggies and drug dealers earlier. Like initially frame it as motivated to stop Poppy because of her role in the drug trade, and then switcharoo towards the end. For some reason Harry felt out of place too.&&If Vaughn's planning to do another region, like how he did America this time. I hope he picks Australia. The Hemsworth Brothers can finally star in a movie together and Hugh Jackman could come in too. It would be pretty fun. &&Indian Kingsman with Dev Patel, old Kingsman group forgotten after Britain left India &&I was thinking the franchise might be dead as for some reason I thought the sequel drastically under performed from the original at the box office but I just looked it up and it only did $19 million less worldwide ($395 million vs. $414 million).

Edit: Shameless plug to /r/BoxOffice for those - like me - who are inexplicably concerned/obsessed with discussing the earnings of multi-billion dollar Hollywood corporations.&&Oh boy I hope this time we get a CGI interior of a butthole &&I hope they bring in the Canadians.&&So real talk here: I enjoyed the first one a lot. The second one seemed to be a bit of a misstep but still fun. That being said it got mediocre/rotten reviews and this brought my thoughts back to Kick-ass. People always say he would have made a much better movie than Kick-ass 2 than Jeff Wadlow but I’m not sure now seeing Kingsman 2. Maybe Vaughn should stick more to creating one off movies like First-Class, Kick-ass or even the first Kingsman could have been. I hope he brings something new and fresh to the table because Kingsman 2 felt lacking in that area. Also a villain that doesn’t just chill in one room the entire movie.&&Well I'll watch it, I've enjoyed them so far &&They better not pull any BS like killing off the Statesmen in the first 5 minutes. That irked me so much about the The Golden Circle. &&I’d like to see them go to Australia and meet the Bushmen, right Aussie blokes played by the Hemsworths&&I'd still love to see a sequel to Stardust.&&I hope it's more like the first and less like *gestures at everything else*&&Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong, West Virgina, mountain mama, take me hoooooooooooome. &&I'm looking forward to this, but I really hope they don't underuse the Statemans again &&Good. While I share in the common consensus that the second film was disappointing compared to the first, it was still an overall positive experience for me, and I would be glad to see a third one.&&Well it can only be an improvement on the second one. Honestly I feel like people were way to easy on it, they killed two great characters from the first one in a dumb way, stretched the suspension of disbelief even beyond the imagination of the previously established world, packed too many things in one film without doing any of them justice and above all it was just cartoonish style with zero substance that only heightened the flaws of The Secret Service. &&Thanks, Bruv&&I read that he wants Dwayne Johnson as the villain, which would be fantastic. &&Only recently watched the second one and while I was in the Vaughn-can-do-no-wrong camp, I'm didn't enjoy the second one.

It lost some heart and all it gained was more CGI. It felt like a different franchise.&&More Bond-like over the top gadgets and more interesting choreography & camera moves like the first and beginning of 2.

Less of the over the top yet boring villans and incredibly awkward sex. &&I am a lot less excited about this than I was when they announced the second one.

The first movie was damned near a masterpiece. It was beautiful. And while the second movie was far from *bad* it simply lacked that special something that made the first my favorite spy-movie of all time.

I'll probably still see it, but I'm not going to be particularly hyped for it.&&More anal sex jokes please. &&This is the one franchise that I will be pissed if it doesn't continue after Disney ends up buying Fox.&&[deleted]&&What annoyed me most about this film, is that they had built up this world of the Kingsmen in the first one and that now Roxxy and Iggsy had become proper members, they should have explored that more - in the same way John Wick 2 did with  the assassin world. Instead, they destroyed everything cool about the first one in the first ten minutes and tried to add a new world that nobody cared about.  

&&Bring back Roxy. Roxy is bae.&&Loved Kingsman 1 hated the sequel.

From my point of view they went more towards the American in your face style of comedy rather than the subtle British humour that made the first one hilarious.

Channing Tatum in it seemed weird and as others have said killing Merlin was ridiculous&&I know it’s unpopular but I actually loved the second one. Really happy to get a third &&I really hated the second movie outside of some of the action scenes.

The first is one of my favorite movies. &&I would be more excited if they would quit killing all the secondary characters I like, and replacing them with far less interesting ones.  &&Until I see bodies, I still think Merlin and Roxy lived.

Merlin was blown away by the blast and not splorched.  We saw in the first movie someone with prosthetic legs.

Roxy looks like she was ducking for something, a hidey hole perhaps?&&They're gonna kill the fuck out of this franchise by shitting out so many movies in such a short time&&I hope they do a better job with 3, because the sequel was pretty disappointing. The girl playing his fiancee couldn't act, I don't understand why she was even there. He had anal sex with her at the end of the first, so what, they needed to be in a relationship in the 2nd? For morality reasons? He's a spy, he needs to be single. Also, Channing Tatum was in a coma the entire movie. Could they not afford him, but still wanted his name on the marquee? And the Harry amnesia thing was just awful. Just have him reappear and relate what happened. Maybe they realize there is some unseen person helping them for part of the movie, etc... And all of the people being ground up was overkill.  The only shining light of sequel was Moore's performance. She was great.&&I wonder what the asshole joke is gonna be at the end of the movie 🙊&&Can we please not have a finger bang scene. Thanks. -humanity&&I like the cinematography in the fighting scenes.&&Kingsman 2 was a royal mess and not a good movie, withou CF it'd been 10x worse. I don't think Vaughn should be allowed to do the 3rd one. This is a original IP franchise with a lot of potential and its been turned into a comedy fest.&&Omg, please, No!&&Please no. The first one was interesting and entertaining, the second one was awful.

It felt like it was written by four 12 year olds.&&Wow, the comments here are *really* hating on 2.  I liked it pretty well, though not as good as the first.  if the first was, say an 8.5, the second was at worst a 7.5 for me, though probably an 8.  While there were some missteps, I still found it a fun movie, and given how bad sequels can be, I thought it was a decent followup, and I'd happily watch a third installment.&&The original was OK.  I think the problem is that its trying to be both a nudge-nudge wink-wink self-aware parody of the genre while at the same time embracing whole swathes of the genre its trying to parody.

The second just wasn't very good.  Although you do get to see a [fairly realistic demonstrating of getting to third base.](#spoiler)

I can't imagine the third being better.  They set it up with Halle Berry and tatum channing, but still, I think its going to continue to regress.&&The whole Merlin thing ruined it for me. They have magical technology that can do whatever they want with but can't diffuse a remote controlled bomb?  Or come up with a plan? Ridiculous... The whole second movie was just blah and a bore. I was so disappointed.&&LOVED the first one. Massively disappointed in the second one. This is gonna suck.&&Yeah because people were dying for this.&&Why the hype?

My girlfriend and just watched Kingsman 2 and turned it off after 45min.  The action was mind numbing and the pacing was all over the place.  We turned it off at the scene where one of the US spies explains to Eggsy that he needs to stick his finger in some girls vagina in order to implant a tracking device or something.  So then he calls his girlfriend to explain to her that he needs to have sex with this woman in order to complete the mission. Seriously.  I think the script was written by a bunch of 15 yr old boys.&&Ha, I'm watching the first one right now. And just read the newest issue of the latest mini series.

So bring on the 3rd! &&I guess I was the only one who was bored watching the sequel. Although like the first movie there was good action and humor, plus some serious ethical social issues to think about.... the sequel just dragged halfway through...

Plus, there was that awkward sex scene that many women have taken offense to, understandably. &&Just watched the second one recently, I welcome another with open arms.&&Only just watched the second one the other day. Really liked it, but was hoping for a realistic look into the state of the world after the events of the first movie. That being said, this kind of movie isn’t the type to delve into the political or philosophical conundrums of most world leaders dying haha&&I really liked the second one. I think it got hated on because it wasn't quite as original and was just more of the same. Personally, I don't mind more of the same.&&I liked the first one, but the sequel was _really_ fucking awful. Cringe after cringe.&&I honestly hated The Golden Circle so I have no interest in a 3rd one.&&Roxie should come back as a villain (since they can just use the old amnesia plot).

But frankly they need to up the cliche and ridiculousness. Some jumpsuits for the villains at least.&&Statesman will be the next one &&I really enjoyed Kingsman 2 and am suprised to see it so maligned, went to see it with my friends after an exam and it was honestly one of the most enjoyable experiences (so funny-particular Elton John). 

Admittedly I haven't actually seen Kingsman so my standards from a Kingsman movie are undoubtably different. &&stop making this movie. &&Can someone explain why these movies have a serious following? It's like the British version of the XXX movies.&&The First one was so well done. The second one sucked big fat bawls.&&I would've been absolutely fine had they kept Harry dead and focused on Lancelot instead. &&I just didn't like how they introduced him as a sympathetic character but his demise is being shoved into a meat mincer. It felt out of place and kind of awful considering he was one of the good guys for basically the entire movie. It should have been poppy being put into the mincer.&&Or throw a curve ball and reveal whisky's really agent Javier pena who got promoted to the statesmen.&&The whole movie was an ugly mess. And it is in no way an adult Film despite the r-rating. I found it almost disturbing in some ways. The message is is quite regressive if you think about it. Eggsy the once-upon-a-time underdog is now marrying into a royal family. He is shown how to behave, how to dress and all that in order to please the elite. Only after he is seen worthy of his girlfriend's parents is he allowed to marry into the high family. The world depends on some private secret services, a few powerful figures, to make the important decisions. His earlier friends from the underclass are painted as idiotic stereotypes who behave so we can also look down on them. And then they are disposed. The past is here to help you in the form of old clothes, traditional whiskey and ancient role models. 
It's the ultimate regressive message here. It's like our hipster world in a way. Everybody longs for the good ol' times, with big beards, handmade things, woodworking, retro cars and *manners*. 
But at the same time we are keen to let technology companies rule us in all kinds of ways. Let algorithms decide things instead of us in the form of filtering out virtual (and increasingly real) environment. 
Apparently we just want things to *look* like in the good old times, but are entirely disinterested in how they really are. That's what I saw in this film - everything is invaded by new technology - quite literally with this woman at the festival - and we just care about it looking nice and vintage abs familiar. That's what was bothering me - this film is suppedly for adults, but it treats us like children. There's nothing adult besides it being a little more bloody than usual. 
Down vote me into bloody hell now.&&I was pretty disappointed that instead of building on the 1st movie, they just tried to remake it. At the end of the 1st movie he matures into being a kingsmem then the 2nd he's back to being a punk kid again, totally killed the momentum of the franchise &&""Kingsmates""&&""Kingsmen 3: Thunder Down Under"" pls&&The Bushmen.

What would be fantastic to do for that would be bringing in legit Bollywood talent.

Yeah it was a little extra campy, but everything that made the first one great was still there. Great action, interesting characters, cool set-pieces, smart humor, tons of references to classic spy films, unconventional storytelling, cool tech.

It wasn't perfect, Elton John was a bit too flamboyant, the CGI was a little distracting at times, the story had to stretch plausibility at times, but I certainly had a great time watching it, even if I'd rank the first movie above it.
&&Except the second was worse, so the third will likely see a decline in earnings unless it's really good.&&I was really disappointed with the sequel. Didn't have the charm or storyline of the first. &&The first one was a really good movie but the second one was nothing in comparison even if it just earned 19 million less&&The first movie was funny and clever and had good action. The second movie was farfetched, unrealistic and corny. I'll probably skip the third.&&The sequel was bad and very cliche, the original one was fresh while the sequel seemed to be all the rejected plot devices from the first one. &&It SHOULD had done more, but the movie itself was kinda awful.&&It was word of mouth.  Many people (everyone I know ) said it wasn't as good which gives the idea that it underperformed.  

In truth a sequel should make significantly more as the brand now has fans and is established.  See transformers, pirates , marvel and every other recent franchise for this.&&Why didn't he just offer her some cocaine with the tracking device in it? The nose was the first place he thought to put the device.&&I went to go watch this movie with my family; *that* scene in golden circle was so awkward with them :/&&If they do I think it would be hilarious to parody the fact that Canada’s secret service CSIS is comparatively unknown in the media. It was created in the 80s but has originating ties to both the US and Britain way back to before the American  Revolution. So having a Canadian actor like Reynolds or Gosling be this weird rogue that supposedly keeps on getting killed protecting the others yet keeps on coming back from the dead to help would be a somewhat hilarious. 

As a lover of the genre and history of spies I think Canada would be a good spy agency to add. &&Moosemen. And Justin Truedau shows up for 2 secconds. &&It would not be more difficult to make a better movie than that dumpster fire of Kick-Ass 2.

Kick-Ass is one of my favourite comedies, what the fuck happened? Who approved that stupidass shitting scene? &&I felt they didn't spend much time developing the villain into something believable. The first had a villain that actually believed he was helping save the world, by killing people. The villain in the second just wants to make more money, but ironically killing off the very people she makes money from. It makes the character feel more sloppy than anything else. Also on a side note, what's the point of the randomly evil president? I get they might be referencing the ""Obama"" cameos in the first one, but they play the president like a megolomaniacal supervillian, with relatively long scenes full of cackling and monologue, and almost no direct connection to other characters in the plot. &&imo, and strictly imo, kingsman 1 subverted the genre of superspy, and that's why it worked.

2 tried to not become a clone of 1, while attempting to subvert 1 at the same time, and ended up leaning way into the superspy genre in the process. it could work if they made the movie more self aware that they're doing that, but it played just a little too straight.

villain sucked too. whose idea was it to make 4 villains anyway. (druglord, president, rogue agent, rival)

the action scenes and camera work are still choice though. colin firth, mark strong, and jeff bridges carried the acting so hard. also elton john.&&It wasn't directed by Vaughn but **Red** had the same issue, where the first movie was such a big surprise and the sequel was such a disappointment.

I group Kick Ass with Red because of that, and now I have to add Kingsman to it...&&Unpopular opinion here. (sorry for poor grammar) 

I remember that he said in some interviews that if he was the one who make the second movie of X-men, he would have focus more on Logan part and put Day of Future Past at the finale. He wanted to be the only one who writing the script and control everything but he can't, so he left. 

So imo, I don't think it will come out great as everyone says and I feel like he can make a great movie if it's the first but not the second. &&I think it was just too long. Great, fun afternoon watching it tho.  I think the first one just surprised so many people with the exploding head massacre and you just can’t really ever top that in a meaningful way. Even if you did something better it still wouldn’t be surprising because you now know that that is possible in these films. To me the ending was kinda flat and they missed some sort of interesting opportunity while she was dozing from the heroin. The whole side story of the one guy not having a memory and the butterfly thing just added to the length and not the substance. Still, a better than average action movie with a great cast and a surprising amount of heart with the John Denver song part. :(. Not as good as the first but they can’t all be Aliens. Oh yeah, and Roxy dying was stupid. &&Kingsmen 2 was just too over-the-top. 

I felt like the first one still had just enough reality to it to keep it fun without rolling your eyes. While watching the second Kingsmen, I was rolling my eyes in the first scene and the rest of the movie was just down right cartoonish.&&For me, and I think I'll get downvoted for this, being English then it didn't feel like a real Kingsman film, but a film that was pandering to the American studios/backers. A bit like how some blockbusters now have to go to China to get the revenue from there.

It felt, to me, like a spin-off for The Statesmen than a Kingsman film.&&I love the series and what it stands for. Im hoping this could open the doors for other genres to explore the “wacky” style that kingsman embodies&&I did too.  I feel like the 2nd one delivered what it was supposed to. &&They literally killed off the only strong female character right away.&&I'm still fucking pissed that Roxy was killed off. &&Ahh don't say that.

Also who in their right mind signed off on making a tracker that could only be used by inserting it into someone's mouth, nose or vagina?  Why would they do that?  &&second was ok first was was awesome&&The second one had issues, but I still loved it. It was just pure fun, and I did not expect Elton John to give me some of the biggest laughs in a theater. I also thought the climax was on par with the original.&&Mark Strong had a surprisingly decent singing voice&&*nods*&&Betting we hear nothing about Statesman at all.&&Yeah, I can totally agree with all of that. I was so pissed at [Merlin's death](#spoiler). Such a great character, going out in such a bitch way. What I really, really wanted to have happen - because it would have been brilliant - was that during his solo number, the henchmen are on the radio back to the boss telling her what's going on. Then, at the climax of the song, she turns off the mines, he's rather shocked when nothing happens when he steps off it, and the baddies grab him, giving us both a *wonderful* subversion of expectations in the scene and a hostage to raise the stakes. Plus, it keeps him in the series and he was easily one of the best parts of both movies.&&To be honest I really don't believe those two characters are really dead. I mean, we've already seen someone survive a bullet directly to the eye. Stepping on a landmine and living doesn't seem too farfetched. &&Agreed, it became more Austin powers and less recent James bond. Any film with Halle Berry just seems to become instantly hot trash. I had never heard of the kingsman before I saw the first, loved it. The church scene was unreal. The second I was so let down, the deaths of Merlin and Roxie, casting Elton John, it almost became of parody of the first film. I think they tried to be too funny, decided to get an 'all star' cast and failed miserably. What was the movie from about 5 years who with all the big names with small parts in? Movie 43? &&How about the part where elton john starts flying through the air kicking people? So cartoonish, how can anyone take the franchise seriously after that. It felt more like an austin powers movie.&&They should get Hugh Grant or Pierce Brosnan as a former, dishonorably discharged Kingsman agent to be the bad guy 

But I have faith in Matthew Vaughn to deliver something great &&I'm willing to bet Roxy comes back. That tuck and roll, though.&&What about Roxy’s off screen “wait, she’s not actually dead is she?” Death? They tried to make Merlin’s into a joke and it felt like Roxy was given brain cancer in a 70’s soap opera. &&Ikr. The second movie was crap compared to the first one.

The first one was great and blew me away as I went in with low expectations. It set the bar higher for the sequel and I absolutely hated a lot of it. Mostly the villains and Elton John. &&Why did you hate it?&&23 Kingsman Street featuring Jonah Hill as Channing Tatum's bumbling sidekick&&Or if they didn't kill off every other member of the kingsman.&&I agree with this, but I thought it also could have worked had they brought him back with way less plot surrounding it.

I liked having him back but that whole side plot kinda gummed up the works.&&[deleted]&&Yup. *SPOILERS* As soon as they introduced the miracle gel that could fix fatal head wounds, all sense of jeopardy went out the window.&&I was so sad we didn't really see them together. It would have made for such a good movie. 

No way to bring her back though. &&I don't know, the whole tone was over the top in the way bad bond movies do and not like how good bond movies and the original Kingsman did it.&&I liked Harry but at the same time I would've been totally fine watching Roxie and Eggsy team up. But it seems inter-gender platonic partners only works if your a rabbit and a fox.

I do agree though about adding Whiskeys subplot earlier. I hope in 3 they address the ""partnership"" between the kingsmen and the Americans as well as actually seeing the kingsmen rebuilt. In both movies thus far the entire Kingmen org is wiped out but like 3 people in both movies.

I wonder if they could get a former Bond villain (non-Craig villains so they're not that recent) cause that'd be awesome &&I think he should have had a turning point. Somehow Harry and Eggsy could get to him and he would sort of have an emotional turn over, dropping his weapons and they would all head home, Whiskey stepping down from his position and living the rest of his days in peace. &&Holy shit yes.

Edit: but also thinking about it, I'd guess they'd still be called Kingsman if they were under British control, so perhaps they go into the history of why they changed it and were forgotten; but maybe they kept it and kept out of Poppy's intel &&I'd be down, I honestly just want to see India represented and it was a cool location in the James Bond film Octopussy, really the only redeeming part of that movie &&I think that's a fair point.  I loved the first movie and felt the second was bad in comparison. I didn't really enjoy it.  But watching it again I think it was ok.  I'm not sure how to feel about a 3rd movie at this point though.&&Listen here. I like anyone else went through phases of awe, disappointment, and ultimately hilarity as [Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth, Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal, Elton John all showed up.](#spoiler)

The movies make fun of themselves many times but the first floats on the edge of being more serious, the second you just have to roll with the punches and enjoy it for what it gives you. I was rolling when they revealed [Eggsy would need to use a finger condom to implant a bug](#spoiler)&&It was also much worse. Which is really a shame. I loved the first one. The second one was just.... stupid, I guess?

Nicely done!&&Yea it’s a trap many movies and shows fall into where they self reference too much to the point they become a kind of parody to itself.

I like the first one so much, I'm okay with an homage to the first one lol&&Marginally. 94 million vs. 104 million. But it's still a very healthy profit for the movie. &&Yeah that's the eternal problem isn't it. We have movies like spy kids that don't have a drastically larger budget and they're able to churn out several ones, even with consistent or lowering performance. Now if you make less money and you spent more well then you're screwed.&&What's wrong with it being campy? I never though the first Kingsman took itself too seriously.

I agree, I like the movie a lot. I can recognize that first one was better, but the second one was fun. I'm not exactly looking for plausibility and realism in this franchise.

Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I thought the [head-exploding](#spoiler) scene from the original was hysterical.&&A little campy? That's like saying RuPaul wears a little make-up. 

The second one was one long head blowing up gag from the original, oh with a relationship plot device added in for eggsy. &&Different strokes I suppose, but I thought *nothing* that made the first one great was still there.

For instance, it seemed like the action sequences were trying *very* hard to recreate the church scene from the first movie, but with half the fun and none of the surprise.  In fact, that pretty much sums up how I felt about the whole movie.&&Although there might have been a few laughs here and there, I cannot agree with you. Everything felt short and unsurprising. The first movie had me going crazy and I got so hooked on the franchise I even had to go read the comic books because I couldn't get enough. In the sequel, either characters are killed quickly or introduced characters are just irrelevant. I don't know if its because they couldn't pay A list actors for more screen time but holy shit was I disappointed. I wanted to see more of Channing Tatums characters skills, even Roxie and Julian Moore's. Really the ending was so meh. :/&&The heads exploding into different colored mushroom clouds to “pomp and circumstances” wasn’t farfetched enough for ya? &&Both were farfetched, unrealistic and corny. The second was moreso, and overall I didn't like it *quite* as much as the first one. But overall its style was pretty similar and I got roughly what I expected.

Edit: The scene with the John Denver song was great. I don't care about the logic of how they could have dealt with land mines.&&I really liked most of the first one. It struck a nice balance between absurd, witty, spy action and realism. Then the very ending let go of that balance and just completely shit the bed. The sequel clearly built on that last little bit, and I honestly hated it.&&I didn't enjoy the sequel at all, it's like they saw how successful the first one was and the execs went 'holy shit the crowds loved all the super far fetched spy shit we put in let's double it'. &&Kingsman 1 was as unrealistic as the second.&&The first one was corny too. It was part of its charm. Tge sequel was just long but otherwise just as good as the first&&Yeah it kills me because honestly Kinsmen might be one of my personal top 10 movies all time. I love it that much. 

But 2 was so bad and so dumb it burned all good will with me. I won't give the 3rd a chance unless I hear amazing reviews.&&ROFL did u even watch the first one? The point of these movies ARE to be that farfetched and unrealistic. Its meant to be fun and comical to watch. Not every movie has to be ""realistic"". Its a movie for crying out loud!&&I thought the same, but for some reason every casual movie goer i asked thought the second one was the better movie.&&Wow that would have worked so much better. They were definitely trying to shoehorn in a Bond-type seduction scene. But it was so unnecessary. &&It would have made a lot more sense. That way she would have a better excuse for having to call her ex boyfriend to get the antidote other than ""it was a music festival""  &&Oh I can assure it was awkward for everyone period. That had to be one of the dumbest and most unnecessary additions to an action-spy movie ever. I guess it was a supposed to a hilarious shock-factor joke? It just came off as pure cringe, whole theater was dead silent during that scene. I was sitting next to my grandmother for Christ sake, wtf.&&Took my l girlfriend at the time to see this on our  first date, I could feel the akwardness during that scene &&Not the hamburger? I'd say hamburger was much worse in any way although it was cartoony as heck. &&Holy whiskers that was awkward.&&I'm Canadian and I sometimes forget that CSIS is a thing.

Also they only wear plaid&&I’m Canadian and I totally forgot CSIS existed. I guess they’re just THAT good at being all spy-like and low key. Please bring both Reynolds and Gosling. I originally had them mixed up and I think a few number of people do too. So that’ll be fun to mess with in the movie &&You know damn well It would be some Dudley Doright levels of RCMP with spy flair.&&And their produce is ~~Canadian goose~~ maple syrup&&Just as a note, the source material for Kick-Ass 2 was also way worse than the first one, Mark Miller has issues with sequels and goes for shock over substance because he usually wraps up his character arcs pretty well in the first take&&Kick-ass is the most fun I’ve had at the movies over the last decade. The style and comedy was good and they just obliterated it in the second one. Sorry but why the fuck does his girlfriend dump him because there was a rumor of kickass having a thing with hit girl when she, of all people, would not believe it?

That was such a forced way to get them to break up so they can force a weird pedo relationship between Kickass and Hit girl. &&The flaw was the source material and the different approaches to it. Kick-Ass 1 went out if its way to fix a lot of the flaws in the first Kick-Ass book - redeeming Big Daddy especially. It was an adaptation that was only as faithful as it needed to be, and managed to bring forth the full potential of the story that the source never managed. The same goes for Kingsman, actually; the book is incredibly average, but Goldman and Vaughan managed to work wonders with it just like they did with Kick-Ass.

The second Kick-Ass book had all the flaws of the original - the cynicism, the overreliance on shock value over substance - only moreso. The movie, rather than doing what the first one did and work the flawed material into something better, just went for a straight adaptation and ended up being just as bad.&&They tried to approve a movie where gangraping a kid happens...and their solution was ""villain can't get it up and girl never goes into a coma.""&&Poppy's plan was for the president to cure them so that she could make money legally and move out of the jungle.

TIL Mark Strong and Stanley Tucci are different people&&Both Red and Kingsman 1 work better as movies because you're being introduced to these organizations. So on the one side you're discovering the universe and on the other you're appreciating the plot. Once you get to the sequel, you already know the universe, so the plot has to carry twice as much, which is often impossible to do.&&Pretty much exactly my main complaints with Kick-ass 2 as well. Sure Kick-ass had unrealistic stuff like the jetpack ending, but that mother russia chick just mowing down cops in the middle of the street, and the end battle.&&There's plenty I don't like about them but they are so very well crafted and just fun and laid back. &&Yeah that's pretty much how I feel&&The worst decision of that movie was killing Roxy and the damn dog.

Eggsy's arc in the film is about balancing his personal life with being a stereotypical cold-war superspy, so the tracker was just a plot point to force the non-womanizing Eggsy to act more like a classic spy and create relationship tension.  In concept the gag could've been funny if they handled it right, but as is it just dragged.&&Does make no real world sense but in the context of the story they had magical nanobots or something that got into the bloodstream. To avoid the first pass stomach acid you'd have to stick the thing into some other orifice, hence the dialogue about putting it up her nose. If the tiny monitoring bots could get in through any membrane it seems like you could just make a spray or something and have them inhale it. &&loooooorrrd i can't cha-a-a-ange&&yeah elton john was the tits in that movie.&&I kind of forget the movie, but I remember Elton John being funny the first time we see him, and just kind of unnecessary the second time. &&Call me tone deaf, but I enjoy his version of ""country roads"" more than the original. It's hella more cinematic, and after Merlin's death, it feels more emotional.&&One can only hope. &&I thought they were gonna try to make a separate statesmen movie &&Well considering channing tatum became a Kingsman at the end we might hear from them again &&[Roxie's death](#spoiler) pissed me off much more. At least your spoiler got screen time.&&Would you have preferred the original ending to that character where he survived, but is missing his legs and shows up at end scene with robotic legs?  Apparently the test screening for that went bad as it took away the emotional part during his solo singing.&&Probably the worst character death in any form of media I've ever read/watched.

&&Time to drag Connery out of retirement.&&Don't forget the first movie's ""save me and you can stick it in my butt"" jokes&&They had to do this so they could make the small penis joke.&&Because then you couldn't have a sexy hookup scene at Glastonbury (TM) &&I was convinced that the Kingswoman-whose-name-I-forgot was going to survive the missile strike and show up in act 3 to help save the day. &&Seriously. John Wick worked so well because it kept dropping hints and inklings of a secret high class, assassin society, and in the second movie, it built on all of that. The Kingsmen introduced a high class, spy society in the first movie, and then instead of taking the dive to allow viewers to learn more about it, took it away almost immediately. I hadn't even learned enough about the British side of this spy culture before they expected me to be immersed in an American side. Poorly done in my opinion. &&They'll find some way to bring them back ;_;&&This annoyed me. Every kingsman was at home when the missiles were sent. They weren't out at the groceries, movies, in the club, restaurant, dating, fishing with their dads. No. They were all at home. &&I actually thought they should have expanded on the amnesia thing. Have them try a lot more things to make him remember who he was, kind of paralleling the Kingsman training from the first movie. They just try to drown him once and are like, ""welp, guess he's not going to remember."" My biggest problem (outside of the use of bad CGI and way too much slow mo [and the criminal underuse of Channing Tatum. Seriously? You get Channing Tatum and give him like 5 minutes of screen time before putting him in a coma?]) was the pacing. It just felt really weird and way different from the first movie. It was just one ridiculous scene after another, and didn't have many of the quiet moments between action scenes that the first movie had. It needed some time to breathe.&&[removed]&&I went to see this movie with my dad. After the church action scene happened, the woman sitting next to us straight up left the theater XD
&&Kings men was like James Bonnd and Men in black but not James Bond and Men in black in a very entertaining way. Recommend it.
&&Ugh no please, getting sick of irrfan khan being the only indian actor in mainstream hollywood films.

Get nasseruddin shah as the ""Q"" type

Get Hrithik Roshan/John Abraham as a dumb, pretty hot agent who thinks he's smooth as hell but does dumb shit all the time- think Jason statham from spy

Get sendhil ramamurthy as their recon guy, because this dude needs more work for the talent he has.

Get Paul blackthorne as their head guy, as a nice call back to his Lagaan role, and link modern day indian to the british raj

And obvi, introduce Riz Ahmed halfway thru the movie as some double cross agent who turned to pakistan. Then have him save the day at the end of the movie to drive home the cliched ""we're all the same regardless of borders"" message&&Gotta get the best Indian actor aka Nawazzudin Siddique or Kay Kay Menon&&Is Kingsman going to be a setup for British Empire Cinematic Universe? &&Donnie yen is a high ranking guy&&That would be funny for one scene If they do it right&&Vegemiteman&&Id love to see India on Hollywood portrayed nicely for once&&I liked it, but some parts bothered me a bit. There was absolutely 0 need for Channing Tatum to be in it. Felt like a stupid shameless plug. [The betrayal felt both obvious and forced at the same time. just didn't seem to fit at all. And Merlin's death just seemed to be thrown in for the sake of a trope.](#spoiler). While important parts to the plot I enjoyed the remainder of the movie. Overall top quality acting. &&For a movie that was originally trying to be a little wacky, the sequel was just a little too absurd. If they reel it back a little I think they could make a great third movie.&&Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Kentucky
Mountain mamma...&&I think they beat the Elton John bit to death but other than that I enjoyed it.&&If they send them off to asia I swear...&&They didn’t outdo the church scene, and Elton John’s cameos were too cheesy/campy. Maybe they’d be funnier if I were British. &&Javier Pena lmao&&The character from Narcos was in it?&&I lost my shit when Elton John showed up.&&Agree on all your points.


Also every action scene's choreography and music choice felt like they were trying(and failing) to re-capture the awesomeness of the church scene.&&I love 1 and I think it's also a *good movie* but I still liked 2 a lot even though I know it wasn't exactly a masterpiece.  The second one really felt like someone said ""let's just amp up the ass kicking and ridiculousness"" and I'm okay with that. &&I also think they spent more in marketing and stuff so the performance was a bit disappointing.

I think the first one did pretty well on home-media and garnered more fans who they thought would come to the 2nd one at the cinema.&&Thank god i'm not the only one who thought Eggsy's relationship was contrived. It seems like everyone just accepted it as natural when it was like the most bullshit thing ever.&&The plot was pure garbage, too, and they threw in all these American characters that were more caricatures than fleshed out characters. If a movie is gonna be 140 minutes long, it could do a whole lot better job telling a coherent story with at least some respectable character development and motivations.

Also like everything just comes out of nowhere. Like sending the sick people to stadiums where on a week notice they have cages and cranes all over like the president was secretly the supervillain all along.  It just didn't fit right. If that was a thing Poppy did, sure. But the other way? It's incongruous. Like the entire movie was.&&SPOILERS

...and what could possibly go wrong with a secret agent man publicly marrying a Swedish princess who was abducted in the first movie *because* of how popular she was, with V even pointing out that she can galvanize people. K2 introduced a ton of characters where the only new character who got significant development was the one that got put in the meat grinder in the end. K2 killed off several characters that were an integral, entertaining part of K1.

And the villain never left her tacky little diner.

I was really sad leaving the movie theater after this.&&you're comparing the closing scene to an entire film. first had it's moments well placed throughout, the second was almost non-stop.&&That shit moved me to tears, man. Mark Strong's best performance. The third movie won't be the same without him.&&What made K1 so great was the timing of outrageousness. It held back, and then it exploded. I laughed out in shock and amusement during K1's (apparently unpopular) head exploding scene because I did *not* expect that, especially in how it was executed. But K2 was just one outrageousness after another, no breathers in-between and it really diluted the humour and the awesome factor for me.&&But it had more cohesion and characters weren't throw aways &&They literally say it in the scene where he’s served McDonald’s on a platter

> Valentine: Do you like spy movies, Mr. DeVere? Harry Hart: Nowadays, they're all a little serious for my taste. But the old ones... marvelous. Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day.&&The problem is there's no shock factor to something like that in 2017. Maybe it would have been gross-funny ten years ago but it just came across as cringy and slightly sexist. &&I can watch a scene of a man being minced and munched with my dad. I don't want to watch a close-up of a finger being slid into a woman's panties, followed by the CGI interior of her vagina with my dad. &&No, not really, it was just creepy. I kinda wish they didn’t have that scene in the movie because it was just ^^weird.&&A friend and I were constantly asking what that henchman's motivation was.  Dude, get another job, it's not that hard.  He seemed terrified to be there, had to do some fucked up things to get the job, and it didn't seem like he was being lavishly rewarded for his work, and it seems like they have a one-strike rule at that job.&&I'm Canadian and have literally never heard of them.&&How about Frontiersmen, and they make jackets or something?&&Kingsman was founded in the wake of the First World War, you know what else was founded in 1920? The RCMP. Just make them mounties and have it be the most blatant open secret and Canadians are too polite to notice.&&I hated all the Kick-Ass comics. It's been a while since I read them but they sucked so bad to me. Also Kick-Ass waking over the picture of the girl giving a blowjob to another guy was way too much for me, not really a wrap up.&&Granted there's no shitting scene in the book.&&As a sidenote: in the original, he also goes to her place and confesses that he's Kick-Ass. She pepper sprays him and kick his balls. The comic ends with her sending him pics of herself sucking a black dick.

In the second one, when the bad guys attack the residential area, they go to her place and more or less rape her to death just to piss off Kick-Ass.

Not sure if it's better or worse than the movie, but I can understand why they went a different way.&&I think they just wanted to go a different route than what they did to his girlfriend in the comic. I agree that it was a weird fuckin move but the original would have been pretty rough. &&Yes, you’re 100% correct. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that Mark Millar is great at coming up with fun premises, characters and writing kinetic action... but actually writing comics? He’s not that great. it’s all setup and no story, and I always leave his books feeling... underwhelmed. 

Just compare his work to someone like Gaiman’s or Kirkman’s: it’s like they can say in a single issue what takes Millar an entire arc.&&what the actual fuck.&&[deleted]&&That would be fine if it didn't seem like the president's scenes were added as an afterthought. The main villain is playing second fiddle to a character that is only referenced outside of the main narrative. It could have worked, but the construction was very shoddy.

Edit: But even on top of that, her plan doesn't even make sense! I'm sure if a major percentage of drug users experienced being intentionally poisoned through their use of drugs, they probably wouldn't want to buy drugs anymore, and they sure as hell wouldn't be buying drugs from the same woman who poisoned them in the first place! So she essentially just destroyed her business before it even got legally started. &&If Harry can survive an explicitly shown gun shot to the face, Roxy can survive an attack that doesn't show her dying and in fact shows her discovering the rocket before it hits and taking action.&&YES. she had literally no effect on the plot. if they moved her to kingsman instead of channing then there would at least be some form of tie in, but as it is, her role could be fulfilled by random lab tech (and test out/give a chance to a new actor/actress), instead of a distraction and wasted acting ability/budget.&&Pretty sure Roxy is alive. Reacting before the nukes hit in films usually means magical survival. Eggsy's buddy is dead because he stared the nuke in the face.

Halle Berry definitely not needed, though. I don't understand that choice at all. It was so awkward seeing both of them working the monitors that I thought it was going to turn into some kind of romance scene. &&They killed way too many characters imo...&&Yeah, can we have Roxy back in 3?&&I was pissed that they killed roxy too, but it would be cool see her survive somehow and return in the third as a villain out for revenge for some reason. I mean Colin Firth survived a bullet to the head so I think Roxy could survive a missile to the face.&&he's a good actor, but unfortunately he's playing alongside three great actors.&&Didn't really enjoy him in this film, but it wasn't his fault. When he had amnesia and started hitting on Berry it was terrible. Guy just woke up in a strange place, no idea what's going on - oh, there's an attractive woman, let's go hit on her in an uninterrupted 15 second string of bad come-ons.&&Yea that one left a particularily sour taste in my mouth. Finally, a bad-ass female spy character that doesn't end up being the love interest (she could've been the ""Hermione Granger"" to Eggsy's ""Harry Potter"") and they were lile ""lul she ded now"".&&May be in critical denial here, but I don't think she's dead. I can't explain how or why, but I feel like the brief delay between her last clip and the house blowing up is enough for me to be convinced she's gonna pull a Gallahad and be revealed to have survived for the 3rd movie. And while we're at it, the dog lived too&&It pisses me off especially since it was fucking Roxy who actually passed the final test, whereas Eggsy, especially in the second movie keeps bumbling along, fucking up and getting caught in hesitation and emotions and finally marrying a fucking princess because *that* won't ever backfire when someone wants to threaten or blackmail a Kingsman.

But no. Let's remove the fully fledged competent Lancelot with a solid character development and a whole fleet of fans because... why? For 5-minute-Channing or, what? 

I hate how Roxy was shoved in the fridge so Eggsy could have angst and 'emotional stakes'. Fuck that.&&Yeah, I was expecting her to show up at almost any moment.  Surprised they didn't bring her back during the second one.  Hopefully she'll pop in during the third one.&&That’s fair. But I’d watch almost anything written by Neil. &&Oh nevermind that's completely reasonable then. &&The inside of the mouth is also a mucus membrane, if you are into more easily accessible parts of the body. &&They can her Roxie back right? I mean her ""death"" was a lot more ambiguous then Gallahads and they brought him back.&&Can't argue with that, though it smacks of them hedging their bets so they can bring [her](#spoiler) back with a surprise reveal later in the series.&&I still think she's alive. Cardinal rule of tv/movie, they don't show the character dying, they're not dead. &&No, that sounds dumb, and a cop-out vs subversion of expectations. I like my idea better because it was already shown that the villain can disarm the mines from her desk and the payoff is more immediate.&&No, I would have preferred they change the scene entirely. They're superspies, they can't think of a way to disarm the mine or render it harmless?&&Lol watch Arrow S04&&[deleted]&&Roxy&&Be warned, thar be spoilers ahead:

I loved the first one because it didn’t have the sexist overtones of the second. Kingsman: The Secret Service actually passes the Bechdel test, shows a double amputee female kicking ass beside a male billionaire villain who subverts a lot of male villain tropes, and Roxy’s training to be a Kingsman takes the cake. No body says a goddamn word about a female Kingsman except for Michael Caine’s “At least the girl’s got balls”. She wasn’t sexually harassed, assaulted, or battered despite co-ed barracks, her fear of heights is treated as just another obstacle to overcome and she isn’t belittled for any sort of female frailty, and we have no idea whether she is the first or the fiftieth female Kingsman because it doesn’t matter to the overall plot and IMHO made it a fantastic story. 

Fast forward to the second one, Halle Berry (in arguably one of her least sexual roles) keeps getting passed over because of Whiskey’s determination to keep her out of the old boys’ club, Charlie’s old girlfriend who shows up to get seduced, get infected, and get killed. Roxy dies after basically only being seen doing personal assistant work for Eggsy and feeding him lines. The relationship between Tilde and Eggsy starts out good, but flounders a lot, especially with how passive she seems with regard to Eggsy when she was screaming and fighting to be let out of her cell in the first one. Julianne Moore is arguably the strongest female character, and she’s living in a 1950’s fantasyland in Cambodia with robot dogs and a captive Elton John. 


Also, all the characters in #2 don’t seem quite as real, despite the backstory we get on Harry and the humor that keeps movies like the Kingsman franchise from getting too dark. The thing that bugged me most despite ridiculous stunts and spycraft, is anyone in America mobilizing fast enough to stack a bunch of sick people in cages, in the middle of a football stadium, with automated rigs, when the incubation period of the disease is less than a week -.-

I hope #3 is better than #2.

TL;DR Kingsman 2 missed the mark at treating its characters like people and not shills for anti-drug virtue signaling, I like the franchise the original set up and I hope that things get better. &&Lol Channing Tatum had one fight scene, then they literally freeze his character for 90 minutes. It was like Bryan Cranston at the beginning of Godzilla. &&Ah mate, watch these with Bond films and sneak in a few Transporter and John Wick films as well.

My dream now is to live in a nice house on a hill in Switzerland, and go out on rides with my Audi S8 (transporter), wearing a totally black suit like John Wick did, only to throw cheesy lines at mates or anyone I come across really. 

Then again, I will need a Golf R with Adidas stripes, massive speakers, a chandelier hanging from my rear view mirror, a russian carpet on the back seat, and a few sets of matching Adidas tracksuits to go with it (one for each mood). Bliyatmachine.&&Can we get a Rajnikanth cameo like Sir Elton John got? It was ridiculous and fits right up his alley lol. &&Not sure who most of those people are, but I like it. &&Aaaaaaaaaaaaand I need this in my life. Especially Hrithik Roshan as the dumb, hot agent.

This is all very, very good.&&I like Irrfan Khan so I don't mind seeing him in more things. Plus, that's kind how Hollywood works. You put popular people in the movie to get better ticket sales. I remember the marketing for the Great Gatsby in India&&Perfect&&Kingsmen: The Protectorate of Zululand coming Summer 2020&&Somewhere, a studio exec just creamed themselves.&&Also SPOILERS

the chick from the first one just dying off screen essentially &&I just watched it again since it was in theaters, and while I definitely enjoyed a lot more this time around, I totally agree with what you're saying. 

Also, and maybe it's just me, but it felt like it took far too long to [snap Harry out of the amnesia. I mean, they'd already logick'd themselves out of shooting him in the head, couldn't they have sped up the process of truly bringing him back like they did only 30 minutes later for Whiskey**✴**? Colin Firth, to me, was one of the biggest reasons why the first film worked as well as it did; Harry carried the movie until Eggsy was ready to do that himself, and bringing him back the way they did, only to have him just sitting there, useless, felt like such a cock-tease that was almost unnecessary.](#spoiler)

Oh, and how could I forget about [killing off Roxy! I know that was heavily implied from the trailers, but I assumed it was a misdirect, because they wouldn't actually do that to her character, would they? I'd really hoped that she'd have played a much bigger role this time around, seeing as how she was the one who was named Lancelot, was a full-fledged Kingsman agent, and Eggsy's closest friend. But, nope: she'd served her usefulness in blowing something up in the less-exciting part of the plan to save the world, and she was no longer necessary, delegating her character forever to the category of ""Useless Protagonist."" That is, unless they really go for broke and come up with an even more contrived way to explain how she survived that explosion and was in hiding. I can't really see them doing that, as they brought back Charlie (who was presumed dead) and Harry (who should be dead), and if they keep it up then they're no longer satirizing those tropes, but actively relying on them.](#spoiler)

✴^(As was pointed out, this was actually fairly well explained, I'd just forgotten about it)&&I'm pretty much the same way. I liked it, but I had issues with it.

It definitely felt like a commercial for a Statesmen movie (which I would totally watch). And they killed characters from the first movie that were supposed to matter (Merlin, the female agent, the dog), but they just toss them aside as if they regretted spending any time developing them in the first place, as if they didn't matter at all to the audience.&&Apparently [the original plan was for Merlin to show up at the wedding with prosthetic legs but the scene test well with audiences. There are even pictures of him with a kilt and green leggings. I agree that killing him off was stupid and it was really the worst part of the movie to me.](#spoiler) I loved Elton John's parts though. The whole theater was rolling every time he was onscreen.&&[deleted]&&It really came across as a movie that kind of forgot why the first one was so good. It was still perfectly fine tho.&&I actually liked it a little more than the original. The writing was terrific IMO as a lot of the one liners were hilarious. Especially the parts with Elton John in them His delivery of almost all of his lines had me howling. 

>*What have you done to me you fucking bitch?!*

and this:

>Alarms go off

>Elton: Is it a rescue attempt?

>Baddie: Probably. 

>Elton: Yes! *begins playing on the piano* Wednesday! Wednesday! Wednesday!

>Baddie: Isn't that supposed to be Saturday?

>Elton: What day is it today?

>Baddie: Wednesday...

>Elton: Exactly!

Him kicking ass in the multi-color feather suit was also fabulous. I also thought that Julianne Moore's character was played very well. &&There was 3 movies this summer that had that as a major plot point. Kingsman, Logan Lucky, and Alien Covenant. Did some writer have a bet to get it in as many movies as possible?&&*Virginia

FTFY&&Please don't that death actually hurt me&&How do you mess up those lyrics man&&I'm actually happy that they didn't try and out-do the church scene; it would have ended up a fucking mess if they had. They may not be able to ring that particular bell twice, and I'd rather they just not try if they can't.

I agree that Elton John got tiring, though. He could have worked just fine in his place in the movie with a *lot* less screen time.&&Yeah after he finished building that fence with his dad he joined the Kingsman. &&There were some good moments like Pablo's gunslinger scene in the snowy woods, but they definitely went too far with trying to replicate the church scene. 
&&Bouncy killer legs woman was there for most of it. Not exactly normal stuff there.&&He'll be back with cyborg legs, just you wait.&&We saw a group of 7-8 kids go into Golden Circle with only a single mom to chaperone. They learned a lot about the world that day.&&Username does not check out.&&Guess that means they're doing a good job lol&&Frontiersmen sounds perfect ... and they’re funded by selling marijuana and holding pancake breakfasts. &&I'd be ok with Maplemen&&Damn, being raped to death sounds really brutal.&&In the comic, the motherfucker and his crew, gang rape Dave’s girlfriend and put her in a coma. Why?
Wackiness? I guess? &&I think they’re referring to Dave’s girlfriend/crush, which is what happens in the book. Not Nightbitch. &&In the book, it happens to Dave's girlfriend and not Night Bitch. She's a High School student.&&In the comic book it's the teenage girlfriend.&&That is true but still. &&I really think she hid in some sort of bomb shelter under the bed. i mean why show it if its not supposed to mean something. She clearly saw it coming and jumped to hide, now if she just sat there and watched it come in and said something a long the lines of ""oh shit"" or something, then i would think shes dead, but they didnt, they left room to bring her back.&&That's such terrible writing though. At least Harry 'died' just before the climax of the first one, and was the main or perhaps second main character of the movie. Hell, it was still bullshit how they managed to save him, but Roxy dies within the first 20 minutes of the second, is mentioned like once again and that's it for the rest of the movie. Are they just going to pull some 'Actually I had a secret trap door that I managed to sneak into because I had about 1.5 seconds before being absolutely incinerated' nonsense? If you're gonna pull some crap like that, don't wait for a sequel to do it.&&Indeed. I actually really liked her character/look too, so I wish she had more to do.&&Not to mention the **terrible** accent. There are plenty of Mexican cowboys; he could have easily done a Spanish or Mexican accent. Then have him use the name tequila.&&But hey! We had Channing Tatum who was comatosed the whole movie and the most absurd and completely idiotic way of bringing back Colin Firth who, imo, should’ve stayed dead. If they wanted him around, they shouldn’t have killed him in the first place. &&Not only was she an amazing female character she was genuinely one of the most enjoyable parts of the first movie for me.&&I don't think she's dead either but I do think it's scummy that she was fake killed off just so Eggsy could have some angst and motivation.&&Well Good Omens is coming in 2018- my dad just finished the seance scene and Neil was on set helping direct.&&I suspect Roxie isn’t dead and has been solidifying all of kingsmans assets.&&It's a sequel hook for the third one. She survived and rescued Merlin at the end of the movie and they're going to both show up together in a plot twist in the next movie.&&Also didn't Vaughn say they were  planning to show Merlin alive, but cut it out last minute? &&
I mean they can only do that so many times &&I mean, they *showed* Harry's death explicitly and he still came back.&&I'll be honest my expectation was that the henchmen would have forgotten to rearm the landmines after the lawyer showed up, especially because she explicitly said ""Don't forget to rearm the landmines"" leading to an anticlimactic moment.&&He didnt even call her pretty bird&&How can you make this comment and not mention the cringefest that was fingering a tracker up a woman's vagina. That was really really really tonedeaf.&&I saw somewhere that originally Tatem was supposed to be the double crossing Statesman guy, but then his schedule got too crowded with filming for other movies so they had to rewrite it and make his role smaller&&The only reason Tatum was there was to show off his bulging penis as he was frozen in his underwear.&&You know you gonna have to sacrifice a wife and dog for that right?&&Kingsmen,. 
Statesmen..
Freemen..&&Since they didn’t show it, they could bring her back in the third one. &&yeah, cannibalizing a character in that way when they don't really get a chance to even display a personality just rubs me the wrong way.

the way they handled it was pretty much on par with conveniently never showing her on screen or mentioning her whatsoever.&&ya that actually pissed me off. Like really? after all that just boom? that's all she gets -.-&&Yeah that was really stupid. Also, where are Eggsy's original friends? They were replaced by some different blokes for no reason at all it seems.&&Yeah, that was really frustrating - I was really looking forward to her in the second movie, it felt like such a waste of potential.&&Did she die? I can't even remember her?&&Her death bugged me...and the movie felt like a whiskey commercial at times.
So sad since the first is one of my favorite movies.&&have to agree with you there. it should have been a much quicker process......thought the whole [bring dead guy back to life with jell + essentially magic was a wtf moment.](#spolier)&&There were two ways I feel they could have done Firth better. 

Don’t reveal him at all in any marketing. Completely hidden. Then at least first viewing it would be cool. 

Or

Leave him dead. He felt so useless in this movie, and like...Harrison with Solo. It was clear they didn’t really have the same heart they did. &&The thing with Whiskey was they knew how to trigger him. They had no idea who Harry was or who he worked for and therefore didn't know what his trigger is. 

But Yeah, agree with having Harry useless with the butterflies was a bit much. &&Damn, really? Elton John's entire bit in the movie just felt way too in-your-face to me. I get it, superstar cameo, he says fuck a lot, how funny. But the whole bit was far too self absorbed without having the charm of the first film to fall back on. &&Introducing him before his actual role in the third movie.&&they wanted to introduce ""an american kingsman"" but they didn't want to tell the story of him going out and kicking ass because they wanted to tell eggsy's story

channing takes over as the whole duck out of water story in the 3rd installment of the film taking over as the lead protag due to eggsy being married&&An American name to help sell it in the US.&&Quite a few purposes, actually. [Showing the power of Statesmen right from the start by beating 2 kingsmen in hand-to-hand combat, showing how broken Whiskey has become if he was willing to sacrifice a presumably long-known close colleague/friend, emphasizing the depth of new bond between the two agencies - Statesmen giving Kingsmen money was probably not a big sacrifice for the US agency, but giving them one of their best agents is much more than a gesture.](#spoiler)

He's more of a plot device than an actual character in this movie, but it's okay in my book, plot devices don't have to be suitcases with lightbulbs in them.&&the first was a parody of spy movies and the second was a parody of the first movie&&To me, the second had some great moments but never really felt together enough, if that makes sense. Lots of disjointed scenes. &&I enjoyed it a lot too. I think as far as the action scenes went it improved on the first in almost every way. Twirling a revolver around your finger and having it kill everyone around you and jumping through a lasso in slow mo are just so cool. My only complaint was that it was a little too long, but overall a really fun movie.&&I had just watched Logan Lucky earlier in the week and finished Kingsman 2 today. Now I can't get that fucking song out of my head...&&And all three starred Channing Tatum!&&http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/why-is-john-denvers-music-in-so-many-movies-this-year.html

Doesn't seem to be any reason other than “people like it”.&&Yes&&Channing Tatum was in two of them. I wonder if he had anything to do with it.&&It could have had something to do with Denver dying 20 years, and this was a way for some filmmakers to pay tribute to a man who stood up against censorship, and had some great songs.&&Fix the film not my comment.&&Nah he's gonna come back. It'll happen. &&Because they were in Kentucky. It irritated me that they made that song such a feature of the film, and they weren't even in the right state. &&He honestly should be shot it's so bad&&He recovered quickly from his fight with The Mountain.&&The actual foot...blade...things were used sparingly, though&&I will laugh my ass off if that happens. Now that you mention that, I'll probably be disappointed if they don't do that.&&Yeah fair enough lmao&&Or Woodsmen maybe? Because of maple trees?&&The comic is more of a deconstruction than a parody. Think Watchmen. It is meant to show how absolutely horrible a world with vigilantes would be because bad people in the real world are really bad, and good people are never actually good. And you would actually have to have super powers to successfully be a vigilante without killing people. &&[deleted]&&Really?? I don't even remember her from the first movie. I just remember Colin Firth and Eggsy and Sam Jackson all being weird and crazy and fun to watch. She must have played it very straight.&&I don't even feel like seeing it because of it. &&Her roll away at the last second even when she knew the missile was imminent suggests a lot of leeway to bringing her back. 

E: Spelling. Don't write half asleep. &&Don't toy with my emotions like that.

#COUNTRY ROOOOAAADDDSSS#&&I wouldn't be mad in the fucking slightest. All I wanted was a movie with the 3 of them fucking rocking it. Harry's back? Even better, the 4 of them rocking it. 

I wouldn't even be mad if it was an alternate sequel. I want to see them all together &&If hes alive then they either fucked up the SFX or hes going to be part robot in 3. You can see his body go full ragdoll when the landmine explodes. I hope this is not another magic nanobot situation.&&Why not just have that be the running gag of the kingsmen movies?&&If the series had any integrity, yeah. I️ think after the second one, anything’s fair game.&&i honestly never interpreted it that way. i mean, they're kingsmen, they have a bulletproof umbrella, grenade zippos, and many more gadets we can't even begin to think off. if i remember correctly, all we saw is the gun pointed at his face and then the feed cutting out and Harry falling backwards while Valentine and Gazelle are turning away from the ""body"". As long as there is no burial there is always a chance for someone to return. If i remember correctly then they even planned on letting [Merlin](#spoiler) survive and to only show [him](#spoiler) with a prosthetic lower body. They even had this alternate ending shot, but they decided against it.  
Thats also the reason why i think that [Roxy survived the explosion](#spoiler). We never saw [her](#spoiler) corpse or any kind of mention that they burried [her](#spoiler). I always figured that a Mansion like that with an undergroud secret base, had the mansion decked out with safe rooms in case of attack/explosions.&&Yeah I saw that comment too. It's a shame, these things happen. Looking forward to more of him in the next one. Bryan Cranston in *Godzilla* on the other hand I will never forgive. &&Does it work if they are not mine?&&I’m trying to think up some way to tie in a Freemen’s offshoot group that turned evil due to moral differences, the Freemen’s Sons or as they later became to be known, Freemasons. &&Yeah it was shot weird. Usually sequences like that have the character stare blankly at the window or something else and then BOOM, so you know they didn’t have a chance to do anything.

But not only did she see the incoming missile they even filmed her hauling ass before cutting to a wide shot of the building exploding. And they made it clear that Iggsy and Merlin leave the scene almost immediately to get drunk and then from there immediately leave for America.

They definitely left the window for her to come back, even possibly as the villain because her “friends” never even bothered to look for her.&&She died off so fast that I honestly thought they faked us out and she'd survive somehow. I was super confused when she didn't. &&To his credit, Mike Myers handled the 'inconvenient girlfriend from the first one'-trope with cheerful ruthlessness in the opening minutes of the second Austin Powers movie. Oh well, Elizabeth Hurley, I hope you've now learned the lesson that 'When Mikey wants a handjob, he better get one pronto or you'll be dead by page two. Michael York didn't need reminding even once'.&&Same type of bullshit pulled in alien3. I try to forget it exists for the reason alone &&Vaughn handling a female character badly? Colour me shocked. &&All chavs look alike.&&I never gathered that Eggsy was unpopular so I figured he had more than two friends.&&And his little sister. Where was she? the mom at least was in the wedding. &&To be fair, we had plenty of time to prepare from some absurd device or retconning to bring Harry back; as soon as they released that teaser poster last January, with that Mark Twain quote about the stories of his demise being greatly exaggerated, and the pair of glasses with one lens blacked out, it was clear that they were going to have to come up with some way of fixing a point-blank head shot.

I was prepped for whatever absurd tech they were going to throw out, but [leaving Harry to just sit for about a quarter of the movie](#spoiler) just made things worse, especially once we saw that the [amnesia could be cured instanteously as we saw with Pedro Pascal's character](#spoiler). I wasn't fully expecting Harry to just suddenly be the same suave, collected man he was, and I actually liked [that they compensated for his lack of depth-perception in that initial bar fight](#spoiler), but he was almost entirely useless right up until the point where he wasn't, which [came completely out of nowhere, as he's suddenly got all his faculties to be the only person among them to suspect WHISKEY could have ulterior motives -- motives, of which, felt so thrown in at the last second. Them handling Harry as poorly as they did is pretty much my biggest gripe.](#spoiler)

Listen to me. There I was originally stating how much I liked it the second time around, only to immediately shit on it.

For those who haven't seen it, the charm and the chemistry of the characters are still there, and for its several faults with story structure, pacing, and poorly-fleshed-out B-characters, its very much got some of the same heart as the first. Unfortunately, It just seems very likely that Goldman and Vaughn didn't have nearly as clear a vision for how this was supposed to go as they did for the original, but I will say that they did their best to bring back as much of the good stuff as possible to actually make it worth watching. If you go in with tempered expectations (which I definitely did not) you'll likely have a better time.&&I was in the ""Leave Him Dead"" camp at first, too, but when I thought more about the entire backbone of the series being a mixture of an homage and satire of the spy genre, bringing a character back from the dead is one of the classics, so it was kind of fitting for them to come up with some contrived way of bringing him back.

But you're absolutely right: if they could have kept Firth's involvement under wraps, or at least not come right out and say, ""Hey, Harry's back,"" I think that reveal would have had a much bigger impact overall.&&I mean, that's basically Elton's stage personality which is why it works..&&Agreed, it annoyed me even further because the trailers / advertising made it seem like Channing Tatum would have a larger part, but I feel like we actually got more Elton John than Tatum, like he wasn't even a cameo at that point. Hell, he definitely had more plot relevance / impact than Tatum too.&&Cameos are supposed to be short because they can get the laugh while staying out of the way of the story. Zoolander is a great example of cameos used properly.

Elton John used up screen time that could have been better spent elsewhere. It make his moments feel cheap, the fights feel less cool. Ultimately K2 feels like a movie where the viewer is asked to tolerate everything about it in order to get to the end. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. They had to shoehorn Whiskey in at the end so we didn't just get an overdose and roll credits.&&I 100% agree.  The Elton John were my least favorite parts.  Just seemed way too forced.  But I still loved the movie and will see the 3rd in theaters!

Taron Egerton (Eggsy) is going places.  I have kids so I have seen the movie Sing a thousand times and he does so damn good in that movie.  I have high hopes for him.&&Fucking nailed it.&&Too many plot lines, everyone is dead, infidelity, amnesia, double agent, you could go on and on with that movie &&That's precisely it. The first flows perfectly from beginning to end. We got the gradual reveal that not only was Valentine the bad guy, but a total megalomaniac, but all of that happened naturally along with the rest of the plot. The entire movie is densely packed, and fast paced, without so much as a wasted moment or line.

But that was completely missing in the sequel. The writing was the biggest culprit, as all the other elements were there. It was just too disjointed, [the US president character made zero sense other than being a somewhat funny, but completely stale, saturation of Trump](#spoiler) and we're thrown right into the middle of Poppy's operation and her sheer level of insanity almost immediately, with zero context. Yeah, they eventually let us non-comic book readers in on a bit of her background, but she was also completely boring. That's not Julian Moore's fault, mind you. In fact, without her, the character would have been even worse, but there was nothing to her goals. 

Valentine, as batshit crazy as he was, at least laid out some highly-twisted, but believable, reasoning (that was carefully sprinkled into the story almost immediately) for wanting to wipe out a large portion of the human race, and you felt the stakes. But Poppy's plan? Even as we saw the effects of it, [knowing that there was a very simple way of not only administering the antidote, but even getting to it, totally killed whatever stakes they had managed to create.](#spoiler)

By that point, we've now had one and a half movies showing us just how formidable even one and three-quarters Kingsman agents are, and what we saw of Poppy's organization made it very clear that they'd tear through the red-shirts without issue, [and that Eggsy would find some gadget-y way to get past Charlie's new tech. Leaving the two robot dogs for which served only to add more time to final battle, and then we're left with Poppy, who had no backups or Plan Bs. Unlike Gazelle in the first one, her bodyguard was a Kingsman washout who had already been defeated by the very people she was trying to outsmart, so as soon as I saw that the answer to everything was her laptop](#spoiler), all the suspense was gone because they'd already painted such a vivid picture of how good the Kingsman are, and just how wildly understaffed and unprepared Poppy really was.

We always expect the good guys to win in these kind of stories, so my point isn't that this shouldn't have been the case, but at least make me question whether or not it's possible the evil genius' plot could actually work (""This ain't the kind of movie"" type of playing with the tropes like they did the last time around), or, better yet, just make the journey so much fun that I don't care nearly as much about the destination as much.&&Don't forget about the car drifiting through traffic at the beginning. And the journey into the chick.&&My biggest issue was the CGI, it just wasn't good. The first movie had it but I didn't notice it as much for some reason. Here it was just too obvious.&&Honestly, I didn't really think there was an action scene that was as memorable as the church scene, or as fun as the final fight with gazelle. I'll admit there was some fun stuff, but I didn't find any action that matched the best of the first Kingsman.&&Well....worse things have happened. It's a pretty catchy song. &&I knew that xenomorph seemed familiar!&&Tatum played the Alien?

Shit, that man is a goddamn Chameleon!&&That was the joke. They're from England, that was the only country song he knew.&&Merlin seemed so eager to sacrifice himself that I'm convinced it was some kind of robot prototype of Merlin who took that landmine. Or his brain is saved and put into a robot body. Or as one of the other comments suggested, he survived but lost his legs.

I mean Kingsman 2 was pretty ridiculous (in a good way IMO). I can see this kind of thing happening. The Kingsman universe is really like its own comic book universe. It's so refreshing to have a new IP that isn't afraid to be ridiculous and take a chance with pissing people off.&&Seriously, just set the statesmen in West Virginia if you're going to make that a major plot point! It's just sloppy.&&qyburn used the gel on him&&It would be sweet if they were called Woodsmen. The implications could be a comedy gold mine in the right hands.&&Can't wait to see the super stuff they use to glue all of Merlin's pieces together in the next film.&&WEAST VARGINIEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&&That was honestly probably my favorite scene of the year&&IIRC his lower body was supposed to be blown off, but they thought it made his death too comedic when they wanted it to be serious. &&Give this man his MIB card.&&I had the same reaction. I kept waiting for her to show up in the film because I thought ""there's no way they just killed her off-screen like this with just a comedic drinking / moping session as her send-off.""&&They ""killed"" Galahad in the first one. Roxy's probably coming back as their new Merlin unless they get somebody else to play him. &&Honestly, after Colin Firth survived a literal bullet through the brain, I'm not convinced anyone's died at all anymore.

Well, the people who got ground up into burger meat, probably...&&To be fair, they did it in a way that could be easily explained if they ever did want to bring her back, seeing as it showed her jumping out of the way before the explosion happened. 

If they do, I hope they make it something utterly ridiculous, like how Indiana Jones hid in a fridge to survive a nuclear bomb. &&I kinda expect her to suddenly show up in the third one and save Eggsy to then become the new Merlin. &&There's a comment thread I read for the original Golden Circle spoiler discussion where someone suggested she could come back for the thrid movie badly injured and take the spot of the other ""you know who"" that died.&&To be slightly fair they didn't know anything about Harry prior to his amnesia so they didn't know how to snap him out of it. Whiskey they knew the exact trigger as it had happened before. Not sure if the home release and the theatrical release where different but this seemed fairly well explained to me in the digital copy.&&You actually could survive getting shot in the eye like that naturally, you would just need some luck in terms of the direction path of the bullet. &&> especially once we saw that the [amnesia could be cured instanteously as we saw with Pedro Pascal's character](#spoiler)

I assumed (while I was watching it) that it was because Statesman had prior experience using it on their own agents, and therefore already knew exactly what would trigger Whiskey's memory recall.&&He was supposed to have most of whiskey's parts, but ran into scheduling conflicts so he could only do a little bit.&&Why did they spend so much time introducing Angel? Dude was completely irrelevant. I guess it was really an intro to Poppy but if that was the intent, it could've been done better.&&Having watched Logan Lucky before Kingsman 2, I feel much more connected to Logan Lucky through the use of that song. The movie had its flaws to be sure but I actually felt like that song meant something in Logan Lucky, and that it was just thrown into Kingsman because of its popularity. &&A goddamn *sexy* chameleon. &&Well....it is based of a comic book, so it should feel like a comic book. I enjoyed the ridiculousness of the second one. It wasn't as good as the first movie, but I still liked it. &&His recovery didn't even take that long. The romantic trauma he suffered when the mentalist stole Lisbon from him is what broke him for life probably.&&And the fridge Roxie survived in&&They brought back Colin Firth... I have hope they bring her back. Her character was a key aspect of Eggsy's development in the first film.

She shouldn't have been scrapped. Plus she's nice to look at.&&[removed]&&yeah. shame they killed merlin like they did. Hard to get  new actor to play the role after they blew up the old one.&&I'm sure they can put them together if kneaded. &&Jumping out of the way of what? Literally the entire house, surrounding foundation, and a football field sized area around it imploded like a black hole. They made it pretty obvious. 

Then again this movie made it so even a headshot is just a minor nuisance anymore.&&Well, there is that pneumatic tube transport that connected the tailor shop to the estate that we saw in the first movie. Roxy could have gotten to the tube and been mid-destination when everything went kablooey, and spent the remainder of the movie digging her way out of the destroyed end of the tube. The edit of the movie made it seem like she had no time. But, really, there could have been a few minutes between those shots in in-story time.&&SPOILERs

K3 is in deep shit because it has a whole new cast of characters we don't really know at all. We got bits of Ginger, then we had Tequila who had like 2 minutes of screentime before they put him into stasis for the rest of the movie. Merlin's camping out in Broceliande forest. And if Rox survived, there was *an entire movie* with no character development. 

We have only Eggsy and Harry, we know them and we're emotionally invested in them, though honestly after K2 Eggsy and his whole plot and forced moral dilemmas get on my nerves and K2 Eggsy shouldn't be anywhere near a Kingsman job tbh.

Yeah. Even months later I'm still sorely disappointed in K2 after absolutely loving K1. :((&&Merlin is a cyborg/clone/robot.  That’s why he isn’t in the field but knows everything.  They will find something that needs Merlin to be able to resolve in kingsman 4, go back to the island, find his head and create a new body.  Kind of bender-esque.&&Ah, you know what, that's a fair point, [as Halle Berry's character even says something like, ""Sorry to have to do this to you,"" right before showing him the picture.](#spoiler)

Alright, so it stands to reason it would be faster for them if they've already had to go through it. So, I guess now, I just wish [Eggsy could have made that connection to the dog faster. To be fair to the writers, Berry's character did explicitly state a strong emotional attachment is necessary to trigger the memories, so they at least laid the ground-work beforehand.](#spoiler)&&Which if it means Tatum gets to do more in the 3rd one, that's not a bad thing.  Dude should kill it in a full Kingsman movie.&&I think it also was a way to show what her actual plot was. By Elton partying with Angel, it showed the blue rash developing for the first time. &&I know literally nothing about that movie. I've heard people mention it but I don't even think I've seen previews for it. &&She was the only Kingsman targeted by the missiles that made a move to survive - I assume that means somehow she did. I mean the bad rich kid and Colin both came back from dying in the first movie.&&[removed]&&I'm thinking she just pops back up in the third one. The fact you don't actually see her die allows them to somehow write in her surviving miraculously.  Hell, dude was shot in the face and they brought him back.&&Nowt stopping him being Bond now.  We have done Gritty realism for too long.  We need Suarve, Charming Bond back.&&He is so proper and refined, that it makes it so much funnier.&&[removed]&&Mark Strong is just a phenomenal actor. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. I hope they have a ridiculous way of piecing him back together.

The movie is a big fun joke anyhow. Might as well bring the characters people love back for more shenanigans.&&It was difficult to watch the scenes with Merlin and Ginger, what with Mark Strong acting circles around the perpetually dull poor Halle Berry.&&It's based on a comic book so really is you didn't see the corpse they probably aren't dead. I will be somewhat surprised if Merlin isn't back for the third movie at this point.&&I think it’s pretty safe to say that we can’t be sure of anything when it comes to people dying in Kingsmen.

The way they had her react to the incoming missile was defensive, like she knows somewhere she can go to be protected. If she didn’t think she could survive why run? &&I mean, it's the manorhouse of a super high-tech spy organization. It wouldn't be that unbelievable to think that they probably have several secret compartments to hide in just in case of such an emergency.

Again, like the Indiana Jones fridge thing, she could've jumped inside some kind of titanium wardrobe, or some secret passageway. They showed her jumping for cover somewhere before cutting to the explosion, but it's easily explainable, imo. &&obviously she jumped in the same fridge that Jones used. it did survive a nuclear blast after all. &&In this universe they have umbrellas that can deflect machine guns and artificial intelligence so advanced  it can be giving you a makeover one minute then  attempting to destroy you and everything you hold dear with a grenade launcher the next. Believability isn't something I'm paying for with these flicks they're basically cartoons but with more swearing. &&> Jumping out of the way of what? Literally the entire house, surrounding foundation, and a football field sized area around it imploded like a black hole. They made it pretty obvious. 

She could have jumped into something like an escape pod, and gotten away.  You never know.

I don't care how she survived, just so long as Roxy comes back.&& There are set photos of Merlin from Kingsmen 2 attending the wedding wearing a kilt and greenscreen leggings. Apparently there was and alternate ending where he was at the wedding with bionic legs. 

I think it's safe to say he's not actually dead.&&I saw it in theaters and felt like it was worth price of admission. If you feel like watching Daniel Craig and Adam Driver in comedic roles, I recommend checking it out. &&",2017-12-12 20:45:35

They knew that movie wasn't gonna make money. It was mainly about awareness. It was financed single handedly by Kirk Kekorian bc he was so enthusiastic about the Armenian Genocide story being told on film. And he died before the movie was released.

I actually like mark wahlberg as an actor, but I can't get past the fact he's living a glamorous life and some innocent guy is blind because of him&&I've always felt he's the Poor Man's Matt Damon. Similar height, similar build, similar age. When your movie budget can't afford Matt Damon, you call Mark Wahlberg.

Edit: I don't mean to imply they're a similar caliber of actor. I think Matt Damon is awesome as an actor, but not so much Mark. You get what you pay for. &&I wish I was the most overpaid at my job. Seems like....a great list to be on top of forever.

&&#For the love of God STOP LINKING TO FORBES ARTICLES THE SITE IS CANCER&&I feel like he gets way too much shit for his acting ability. He's absolutely fantastic in Boogie Nights, I Heart Huckabees and The Departed, and I've liked him in Ted and all of his work with Peter Berg.

He's coming at you every year, right around that time of year no franchise is coming. He's going in theaters he's getting that 10 to 20 mil opening week. 


He's releasing that dvd. He's getting that 7/11 and Wal-Mart distribution check.


He's hitting Redbox hard on royalties. 


Then he's rounding it out with Netflix. 


The next year he hits your with a prestige movie like *The Fighter* or The Departed. 


Then the next year back to his ""everyman"" movie. 


This guy is like the Jay-Z of the movie world. This is a B U S I N E S S man. He does the prestige stuff to keep the brand in tact but he's here for the $50 million checks and the backend that won't ever stop. 


D O  N O T  K N O C K  H I S  H U S T L E&&I know Transformers doesn't count - but man, what a shit movie. If you had told me at six years old that I wouldn't enjoy a live action Transformer's movie, I'd have laughed at you. 

I was bored by a movie about giant robots fighting other giant robots. The action just looked like poorly rendered blurs with jump cuts thrown in. I'll even excuse the shit dialogue and story.

How in the world did that happen?&&Of all time if you ask me.&&I just wish I knew why we all collectively decided he was the go-to guy for emotionally exploitative movies about national tragedies.  Dude has been in like 3 in the span of a year, it's fucking weird.  

It's weird that we're making the movies at all, and it's even weirder that we're casting fucking Marky Mark as the lead role.  Dude is a straight up assclown who can't play a serious role to save his life, but somehow he's the first person people think of when they're trying to cast someone for a tragedy?   

The fuck?&&Most overpriced cheeseburger, more like it.&&I wholeheartedly agree... His acting does absolutely nothing for me and the roles that he chooses doesn’t demand a lot from him artistically. American guy playing an American role doing and saying American stuff... The end.&&Or he has the best agent.&&It's normal for athletes to make the most money AFTER their best years, no surprising that the same would hold true for actors.&&""actor""

Wahlberg was carrying a large wooden stick, approximately five feet long and two to three inches in diameter. Wahlberg approached Thanh Lam calling him a ""Vietnam fucking shit,"" then hit him over the head with the stick. Thanh Lam was knocked to the ground unconscious. The stick broke in two and was later recovered from the scene.

Wahlberg ran up to Hoa Trinh, put his arm around Hoa Trinh's shoulder, and said: ""Police coming, police coming, let me hide.""

Terrible actor.&&I always figured Wahlberg was so good in The Departed because Scorsese just let him act like himself.

His victim may have forgiven him but that doesn't change the fact that he's a piece of shit.&&I think you could make an argument that he is level headed and as unlikely a risk to be involved in a scandal as anybody in the industry, and that is something that adds security and value to the investment. He is sort of like a mutual fund. &&Not sure if it was on the actors as much as Hollywood laying an egg with audiences. We've been stuck in a world of remakes, and sequels for a good while now, and it's really hard to throw up the old excuse that it's hard to come up with a new idea when Netflix is turning out gold multiple times a year.

While I'm glad we're getting movies like Ready Player One, other titles that should have been the bedrock of great stories like The Darktower flopped big. I just don't think audiences are as accepting of low efforts any longer, especially when it comes to a series like The Dark Tower where people have been waiting a long time for such a highly liked series to make it to the big screen.

It was a little easy to swallow when movies where cheap, wages where high, and rent was low, but you're now trying to sell to a Generation that doesn't enjoy many of those things.&&""I make so much money because my movies are for anyone.  Anyone can come see them.  Jews are welcome.""

2016 no?&&Deep water horizon i loved. I didnt have any interest in it when trailers came out, then one night i was doiwn.a youtube rabbit hole about oil rig failures and [found this video about the details of the DPH disaster](https://youtu.be/9NQ8LehUWSE) and then I realized thats what the movie was about, so after learning about it more (from the perspective of the rig and the technical issues, already knew about the environmental impacts) made it that much more interesting and terrifying to watch. 

According to the people involved on DPH, the movie is pretty much verbatim what happened that night, right down to the technical jargon and depection, and they dont shy away from blaming BP. 

Im not a fan of the patriotic from disaster type movies this director usually makes, but DPH is def worth a watch. 

I thought Mark did a great job in this, espevially in the end, you seem him really exposed and traumatized and its sone of his best acting because its an emotional range you almost never see out of him.&&just watched Deepwater the other night, not bad at all. a little heavy-handed but, i mean, so was the whole clusterfuck that led up to that disaster. &&deepwater horizon is a very good movie. i enjoyed it a lot mostly but less because of Mark Walhburg and more because of the subject matter.

&&I used to be a fan of his stuff until I read about that shit. Not to mention I've seen his appearances on talk shows and I don't believe he's a good enough actor to be playing the pretentious out of touch ass that he comes off as consistently.&&I havent seen any newer movies of his but i did like him in rockstar and four brothers. Picturing matt damon in those roles gives me a little chuckle though.&&Both Boston guys, one's more Harvard, the other's more southie.&&Have you not seen The Departed? Wahlberg kills it, and he's acting alongside Damon, Dicaprio AND Jack Nicholson. &&I agree completely. Even though Matt Damon does more drama and Mark does more comedy. They both does the action, comedy and drama movies.

I like both actors but I feel that Matt Damon is a better actor. Maybe because Mark is in all kind of movies, specially big blockbuster (thats why he lives in a huge mansion) while Matt is more selective of what movies he is casted.&&I prefer Matt Damon as an actor, but Mark Wahlberg as Eddie / Dirk Diggler is one of my favorite turns for any actor. But perhaps PTA is the reason behind that sentiment, as I otherwise agree with you&&I feel that way about Dennis Quaid and Harrison Ford. If you're writing a film and have a character that you envisioned Harrison Ford playing, you hire Dennis Quaid to play him. &&I've always felt the exact opposite. Wahlberg is the better version of Matt Damon in almost every way.&&I wish I was just average paid at my job. 

and I spent that money on Mark Wahlberg movies&&> The problem is he's in way too many shit movies where he tends to phone it in.

I know cinephiles like to talk shit when actors make shitty movies. But man wouldn't I love to phone it in at work for 2 months and collect $10-20M. I'll never begrudge these people for cashing in.&&I like him in The Fighter too.&&> The problem is he's in way too many shit movies where he tends to phone it in.

maybe. maybe not. maybe fuck yourself&&Let's be real here. Mark isn't fantastic in Boogie Nights because of some acting chops. PTA cast him because he needed a sort of doofus, naive kid who thought he was going to be a serious porn actor and had that genuine innocence and idiocy to him, so he cast Mark who didn't really know what he was completely doing at that point, and surrounded him with brilliant actors and a world that he could fade into.

That being said, he was great in the movie and he's been great in lots of other stuff, but I hate when people praise his Boogie Nights performance as something super great. It's just okay.&&Is Mark Wahlberg a bad actor now too because people don't agree with his opinions, or are we saying that the movies were garbage?&&nah I'd give that title to the rock.&&He only plays one character in every movie.

Anything slightly different, and he ruins the character. &&Nobody has the possibility to change in 30 years?&&Scruffy:  ""Second.""&&I'd say this is the truth. I watched a transformers movie he was in the other day...the writing and whole plot was just terrible but wahlberg did an admirable job of making something out of it...I enjoyed his performance even if the rest of the movie was complete garbage.&&This. We know he can do better. He has comedic talent and the departed was the shit. I would have never watched the newer transformer movies if it wasnt for him.&&These are averages... The shit films he's probably pulling $2 for every dollar paid (if that).&&u/rockrulesring, I’m inclined to agree with you. I’ve read that  sometimes actors or directors will make an I-scratch-your-back-type-compromise . Or ‘I’ll  make your three lousy movies if you make my one  pet project.’

&&Hell I wouldn't be complaining of I made 4.40x the amount of money I spent. 

That's a solid profit margin that is. &&Yeah -- everybody is bitching about June, but the error here is the idea that the actor is solely responsible for a movie's box office numbers.  If somebody wants to pay me 30,000,000 to star in a movie with a shit script, I'm game.&&Well ye - he might only do 4 dollars per film or w/e but if his films budget is 200 million, dur.

Same for Tatem, pitt etc.

This is a terrible metric in and of itself.&&In the 90s Sandra Bullock used to regularly make crappy romantic comedies that didn't make massive amounts of money but made enough to keep her getting more movies.  But every penny those movies made they made because Sandra Bullock was in them.  I mean, it's not like anyone went to see  so Hope Floats or Two if By Sea for the plot or anything.  I feel like some actors do carry crappy movies and make money for a studio they wouldn't otherwise make.  Jean-Claude van Damme would be another 90s star that falls into that category I think. If you went to see Kickboxer or Hard Target you went solely because of JCVD.  &&It's a weird way to measure value. It overweights blockbusters and doesn't really tell you how well a film would have done without the actor.&&And Denzel. It may not have made a lot of profit, but he was riveting in Fences. &&Doesn't change that that he's an outstanding actor in my mind. Dude is crazy dedicated&&Does it? We all know Bale and Pitt are great actors and they have already proved it many times. What baffles me is how mediocre actors like Wahlberg and Tatum keep getting those big roles.&&The light shall burn you!&&Bloggers that sign up for Forbes blog. You can be pretty much anyone and get one.&&Yeah, this is pretty bad. Even the writer points out this glaring flaw when she notes this metric gets horribly skewed by the actors doing small budget films.

Essentially measure the lift every actor brings to a given role, and the lost revenue when going with someone else. Somewhere there is a breakeven point where the price tag of an actor is not justified by his ROR. Then, look for the ones still getting work, despite a poor ROR. Those folks are overpaid.&&I think this was more tongue in cheek  than trying to actually find out who is the most overpaid actor&&It’s a list of who is overpaid. So the smaller the first number, the less the movie studio makes, while the actor is still making a lot&&Yes, that's why it is saying most overpaid, #1 isn't necessarily the best, just most over-paid.  &&Example:

If the studio paid Wahlberg $10 and made $40 dollars at the box office, the stat would say that the box office only got $4 for every $1 they paid to Wahlberg.

But let's say Pitt was paid $10 as well but his movie made $100 at the box office. The movie got $10 for every $1 they paid Pitt.

Therefore, since Wahlberg only brought in $4 to every $1 he got paid, while Pitt brought in $10 for every $1 he got paid.

If Wahlberg was only paid $4 then he too would've brought in $10 for every $1 he got paid, just like Pitt. That's why Wahlberg is ""overpaid"".&&Yes. Which is why #1 is the most overpaid.&&Bearing in mind that you have to fit all the other people whose names you don't read as the credits roll into Wahlberg's remaining $3.40... &&It's not a 440% return. It's $4.40 for every $1.00 they pay him. So if they pay him $10 million the movie made $44 million, leaving $34 million to pay for every other production cost&&It's not his personal contribution though, it's overall movie revenue ratio.&&But they're not the only actors/workers on the films. The way I read it Wahlberg is paid 1/4.4th the return on his movies (on average), while perhaps his co-actress makes 1/6th the return, etc. Once everybody is paid, the film's at a loss.&&Use ublock origin + Adblock Warning Removal List, and you won't have any problems with forbes. &&I know, they assume the investment in him as an actor is the only cost and completely ignore other factors, which makes absolutely no sense (except when all other costs would be constant/the same in every movie, then this KPI would be ok for comparison sake between actors, but since they are not, you can't really interpret them adequately).&&If movies had zero other production costs.&&If they started in June of 2016 it makes sense to me.

None of the movies he starred in last year blew up, so it shows if anything he's a safe bet.&&This ranking does not include any film after june 1 2017.

It just means that it costs a lot of money to hire them, and there's not much return. In a movie *Fences*, which is not a blockbuster in the least bit, you're not going to get much of a return.   

If your favorite actor happens to be on this list, don't be upset about it. It's really just interesting statistics rather than something that actually matters. &&Exactly this.

The way I read it was just how much these actors are worth/paid for how much they brought in to the movie, not if they were overpaid or not.&&But wouldn't a no-name actor also have a crazy-low dollars from box office?  What's the salary metric?&&Ahh, gotcha. Thank you for the breakdown!&&r/theydidthemath&&And there are sooooo many variables. If the script was terrible and everything else was great, it could still fail. If the release date was the same day as a major storm or international event it could tank ticket sales etc etc etc. You can really only calculate the ROI of a film as a whole, you can't narrow it down to any single player in the production.

Yupp he was great. But I'm biased, I love disaster movies.&&u/PoopisAlwaysSunny, upvote on the mini comment lol.&&Its based on their salary vs how much the movie made back.

A 250 million film that makes 400m is less profitable than one that cost 20m and made 175m.  Absolutely total budget is part of it.

If an actor works for one dollar on a film thay makes a net loss, that actor, on this scale, is 'overpaid'.

It's a shitty metric.&&[The Promise](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_promise_2017/)&&Dark Knight was the second highest grossing movie ever until Avatar came along&&Denzel didn’t make them $11 for every $1 they paid him, unless you assume the movie would have made literally nothing without him. &&I like how you put it. This list doesn't mean very much at all from a business perspective. Lots of people make movies and lose money without ever paying an actor a big sum. &&Well they exclude movies that were shown on fewer than 2,000 screens and small roles so no-name actors probably wouldn't be counted.&&They are making a total of $4.40 per $1 invested in paying the lead actor. It is insane for a lead actor to be paid any more than 10% of a movie's budget in a major film.

Here's an example:

 Let's say typically, a lead is paid 5% of a movie's budget. Salaries of the other cast and crew let's say are 60%. Then we'll reserve the other 35% for props, equipment, and other production costs. Okay, so on a movie with a budget of $1,000,000, the lead actor should be paid around $50,000 (not bad for a month of work). Then you figure that marketing and distribution are another million in expenses, so you pay a total of $2,000,000 to make this movie. That's the figure that you have to hit in gross revenue just to break even. If you hit that figure and just break even, your actor was paid $1 for every $40 the movie grossed. That is a 4000% return on investment in the lead actor, but the studio still didn't make money because the lead actor is a very small part of a movie's expenses.&&2017 financial year?&&If it's the same ending point every time, it does not matter. Wait until you find out about the ""fiscal year.""

Hollywood's fuzzy math already makes calculations like this hard, but you can't expect them to also factor in movies which haven't closed internationally yet. Receipts are still coming in. June to June is a reasonable way to measure this, possibly the only way to do it reliably.&&Its fiscal year 2017.

Mark also grew up well off and even had a famous brother in a boy and get him out of trouble. He was a spoiled racist guy who assaulted a man due to his race, and acts like the victim because he can't get his record wiped so he can sell alcohol in his restaurants.

He can rightly fuck off.&&He only sought forgiveness because he was attempting to get a liquor-license for a restaurant he owned, but couldn't without a pardon.

Force you to whitelist them, or else you can't look at the site? Problem.&&It got upvotes mainly because of the strong hatred towards ads in general.&&I love how the shills are so obvious about their work. You are completely wrong, and provably so.

All ads should be treated as compromised, all sites demanding ad block shut off treated as malware distributors, and people who claim otherwise should be ignored, because they are blatantly, 100% wrong, and are trying to compromise peoples' systems. &&Good read thanks&&Cher and the members of System of a Down are also Armenian Americans. I think the larger connection between the group and the entertainment industry is that there is a very large Armenian community in the LA area.&&Or bad directing.   Mark isn't doing himself favors, but M'Night needed to say.  ""Can we do that again Mark, with less shittiness?""

On the other hand it's possible the director wanted it to be that awkward.

To give it context it's possible that he is so taken off guard that he acts like that.  Also the woman is fucking crazy and bringing something up out of left field (like someone goes.  ""good night... you're planning on raping me tonight"" you're not going to have a rational response.)

&&He was a shite Max Payne &&Are we forgetting that this was directed by Shamalamadingdong during his weakest period of films. Basically every movie he pumped our was terrible at the time, and his direction directly impeded actors, no matter their talent. 

Poor direction has a negative effect on acting. Another example of this would be Ewan McGregor or Liam Neeson in the Star Wars prequals. Both great actors but were given shit to work with like ""I saw him... killing younglings"" and ""What if I killed a Jedi and took his lightsaber""&&It was bad directing. In the Behind the Scenes clips, you’ll see Mark basically calling something stupid every other scene. &&Ha those same people probably just don’t like him as an actor or something and use that to justify it. Beating him was shitty but it sounds like all parties have moved on. Reddit just doesn’t like letting things go. People still bring up the Rampart AMA. Ha like come on.&&Are you accounting for the fact that Marky Mark asked for a pardon from the MA governor years later?  Doesn't exactly show willingness to accept responsibility to me.&&and that is why the us prison system doesn't seek to rehabilitation...&&Man I was crazy immature when I was 17, so was just about every other 17 year old I know. While I didn't attack anyone then (or ever) I'd hate to have something held over me for the rest of my life and been told that I shouldn't be immature at 17. &&How did he grow up well off? From what I've heard, and what I can see, he had a pretty horrible childhood.&&> Then again I didn't physically attack a man while screaming racial slurs at him when I was a kid, I also don't consider the age of 17 to be ""an immature kid"", you're a year away from the real world, you have a total grasp on your actions and subsequent consequences.

Don't get me wrong, he is kind of a douche. But cocaine can really bring out the worse in people especially if they are already assholes.&&This right here is what people always miss. I'm okay with people being shitheads in their youth, most of us were, but he only apologized because it was hindering him from getting something he wanted. It wasn't because he felt bad or was sorry.&&Source?

Edit: Found info on the liquor license. He came back and said he regretted requesting the pardon.&&As do many&&What's your point in that statement? The majority of prisoners serve less time then they are sentenced.&&Pretty much everyone gets out before their sentence is up.  

Source: Used to do background screening.&&And don’t forget Pluto Nash!&&It's Such a sweet sensatio.... wait wait! We're talking about acting don't try to distra....feel it feel it uuggnhh! Marky Mark and I'm here to move you!♪♫♬&&What the fuck, yo! &&I loved the first one, I was at the 2nd screening on release day and everyone was into it.

I've watched all of the transformer movies, a few of them at the theatre but I'm glad I didn't see the latest one at the theatre. It was just so ""eh"". It was like if someone with ADD wrote it and then would remember things and bring them back into the story.

Even as far as Transformer movies go it was still pretty bad.&&I liked the first 3, but I haven't seen the new ones. I was cool with just having 3. &&Inb4 Reddit tells you that you're not allowed to like him because he blinded a guy when he was younger.&&Eh, they could just call the next one 2 brothers and have it start with the 3rd dying.&&Yep. But let us not forget ""The Other Guys"". Probably the first time I saw him in a comedy. &&Yes. Also a Michael Bay film!&&Pain and Gain was something else. &&I never thought that’s what they did and I don’t think that changes what I said. Aren’t they essentially just dividing the profit by the stars salary? Unless they would’ve broken even without the star, it’s still not fair to say, for example, Denzel made them $11 for every $1 spent.&&AKA FY 2016/17&&most overpaid actor says alot. He was good in ted 2 though.&&[deleted]&&So if the article said something like:
> To compile our rundown, we looked at the last three films each actor starred in prior to June 1, 2017, leaving out animated films, movies in which the actor had a small role, or movies that were shown on fewer than 2,000 screens. Movies released after June 1, 2017, were not considered.

>We then deducted the estimated production budget from the global box office for each film per Box Office Mojo and divided that by the star's estimated pay to come up with a return on investment figure. We used earnings data from Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 ranking of highest-paid entertainers and did not include actors unless they had starred in a new eligible movie since last year's scoring period.

You'd be happy?&&[deleted]&&It’s up to advertisers to make people want to see their ads. There’s tons of product placement in movies that people clearly don’t mind seeing. A lot of TV commercials become memes too (silly dilly). It’s the advertiser’s job to make consumers enjoy the ads as much as possible if they don’t want people to block them.&&Burbank/Glendale specifically, bro bro.&&To me it felt entirely like shitty directing. Pretty much everyone felt like the director said ""act as shitty as possible.""&&a little bit of both i guess bad directing and bad acting.&&Hell, I'd go as far to say that Hayden Christensen got a raw deal from George's inflexible directing and shitty dialogue. He's not the best actor, but everything I've seen him in since then I would describe as ""passable"" or ""decent"". Certainly not on McGregor's level, but definitely not as bad as the prequels made him out to be.


&&That is true. I hate 'M. Night' (and not just because he sounds like a rapper) and Wahlberg was great in *The Departed*&&While a sound perspective, I’m going to forward my own theory: M. Night is/was a terrible director *and* Mark Wahlberg is a shitty actor. &&Calm down woody no ones accusing you of a one night stand here.&&He also got off far easier than most would in the same situation, because of his wealthy brother. Most people would have spent years in prison for a hate crime.&&Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

If that was in the article I'd be happy.&&Indeed, I do a lot of consulting for the federal government.  Travel a lot around...on business...&&Yeah. Mark's done a great job acting in many other films.

Just misguided in this instance, most likely.&&He said he wanted the pardon so he could get a concessionaires license for his restaurant business. &&The specifics are illuminating in this case. His friend, another violent thug, held that guy down while Wahlberg kicked him repeatedly in the face until the guy's jaw was broken.

I had no idea these were all from the same company.&&Also, worth mentioning that it's not opened in the UK yet either. I'm confident it won't make a massive amount of money over here, but I think with all the hype, a lot of people might consider going to see the film.&&Awesome :) It's a great movie! It's actually down to earth which seems rare for Hollywood now-a-days and it actually has a three-dimensional lead actress. It kind of reminds me of indie Mean Girls.&&A24 has moved into Pixar territory for me where I will see absolutely anything they put out regardless of whether I would normally be interested or not.  That's how consistently high quality they are. &&Florida Project, Killing of a Sacred Deer, Lady Bird, Disaster Artist, A Ghost Story, It Comes At Night, Blackcoats Daughter, and Free Fire were all this year. That’s just the films I actually saw. A24 has had an excellent year. &&Are those two new superheroes I haven't heard of yet? &&I would have thought Disaster Artist would have been on their high grosser list. &&Both were great movies. Good for A24&&I figured The Witch would be. That movie is a horror masterpiece. &&Is it about the Hill family's dog, Ladybird, from the TV show King of the Hill?&&Laaaaaaady Biiiiiiird! Come and get your din din!&&Bigger than ex machina?&&Laaaaadybirddd""- Hank Hill&&Maybe people think the movie was called ""Larry Bird"" and they left kinda disappointed&&This movie is so fucking good. I went into it skeptical and came out with it being my favorite film of the year. If you haven't seen it, go see it.

Such a big fan of Saoirse Ronan and Lucas Hedges. &&Glad for A24- but why ladybird? It’s eh———&&I hope people don't forget Annapurna Pictures. &&The great list. I might have a movie night with nothing but A24 films.&&Hank Hills dog got a movie named after her?&&I thought Moonlight was a story worth telling and it was competently made, but I just didn't find it to be a particularly enjoyable movie - even compared to other movies that people claim they don't ""enjoy"" watching like Requiem for a Dream or something like that... Moonlight just wasn't my jam.&&Jesus. It’s not that good. I guess the bar’s been lowered to the point where a movie I’d describe as very nice is Oscar material. &&Why it was average at best and most character development led nowhere, and the main characters development was at the last scene where itwas cut short and the movie just ends didnt think ot was bad but surprised it did so well&&Went to see it box office and I️ don’t know why it got so much hype. It was a shitty movie.&&Such a fantastic film. I have seen it twice. 

The relationship between her and her father really sat with me for days
&&Dissapointed this wasn't a Larry Bird movie.&&What makes it so good? Is this a movie the average viewer will like? Or is this another indie film that uptight reviewers say is the best thing since Citizen Kane but is incredibly dull for everyone else?

Edit: Downvoted for asking a simple question, must be the uptight reviewers.&&Crazy what they've done in only 4 years.&&I used to say the same thing about Lion's Gate...&&Came to say (almost) the same thing. I am cool with them releasing only 10-20 small films a year, I just want them to have the resources so they can take losses on risky films and still remain solvent.&&History suggests this is false in almost every industry. &&Best studio at the moment. Such great work!&&Didn’t Disney just buy them? Or they’re trying to?&&[deleted]&&When you're not the big guy, you take risks to make a name and make the best film possible.  Once you're big, you mitigate risk and make the most profitable movie possible.&&I hope they don't get too big honestly. I want them to maintain their quality films.&&Honestly I'm predicting it to win Best Pic. The Academy votes for how they they see themselves and a female directed film about a young bold woman is very of the moment and is a more palatable movie than Three Billboards it's biggest competition.&&Keep an eye out for the Odeon Screen Unseen on Jan 15th. Apparently there is a high chance it will be Lady bird. So you'll get to see it a few weeks earlier if it is. 

Screen unseen is an exclusive preview event of films not yet released in the UK. Odeon gives out hints so people can make a guess but no one really knows what it is untill youre seated in the auditorium and the name pops onto the screen. &&February? You’ve got it easy. April here in the Netherlands.&&Stay strong, friend.&&Here in Australia there is a weird outdoor cinema that is already showing it. Maybe look around for a niche cinema in your area?&&I mean, you don't *have* to&&A lot of their films deserve a lot more than they made.

Only $2M for **Good Time** is really disappointing. &&Seriously? From all the press it was getting I thought it made more&&I really enjoyed Swiss army man too&&That's God damn impressive. That's more good or even great films in this decade than most major studios have produced. I hadn't even heard the name before this post. &&Holy shit?! Wow, I thought Ex Machina was quite big.&&> So many good films on that list.

I would add 20th Century Women as well. It had a terrible title but was a great little slice of life not that far removed from Lady Bird (albeit from a boy's perspective). Set in almost the same time period too. 

&&I still say Ex Machina should have won best picture that year. Room sure is a beautiful movie so I'm not mad but Ex Machina is something special. 

Edit: apparently Spotlight actually won that year. &&I wasn’t into that one. But I loved ladybird &&Does that include after the theatre because I know a ton people who streamed it on prime like me&&*Enemy* with only $1 Mil - an outstanding movie and performance of Jake Gyllenhaal imho. &&And this is why we can’t have nice things. It’s the reason giant tent poles are the norm now. &&Unfortunately for me I never saw Ex Machina until I saw Joe Rogan talking about it. Wow. What a good movie.&&Really? That makes me sad. It was my favourite film of 2015. And the CGI was really well-done, so it was probably their most expensive movie too.&&Ex Machina is one of my favorite movies. I thought it was exquisitely done and was a real think piece. &&Her accent still comes through a bit here and there throughout the movie. But the transformation is amazing. &&Yeah I was actually a little disappointed in the first few minutes because I was looking forward to hearing her speak.&&She does amazing accent work in a lot of her movies&&I would add Free Fire, The Disaster Artist, The Florida Project, and A Ghost Story as well. Excellent back to back years they've had.&&Oh shit I did not realize these were all the same studio. Some of my favorite movies in that little list for sure. &&They aren't really a studio. They have only produced a couple films. They're a distributor.

The Lovers is the only 2017 movie they produced.&&A lot of these movies are not produced by A24, but only distributed, which essentially means marketed. 

Lady Bird, Ex Machina, The Witch, The Disaster Artist, Under the Skin, Room, The Lobster, Swiss Army Man, and others, were not produced by A24, so why is everyone in this comment section dolloping praise onto them as though they are responsible for these creative decisions? &&It comes at night messed me up big time.

\#7 [Indiana Pacer Chuck] Person went by the nickname ""Rifleman"" and said he was ""going bird hunting"" when Indiana faced Boston on Christmas Day. 

So before the game, Bird said he had a present for Person. 

After releasing a 3-pointer in front of Person on Indiana’s bench, Bird turned and wished him a ""merry f—ing Christmas."" 

The shot then went in.&&Most of the general public only see the boring blockbusters. Don't realize there are amazing films outside of their comfort zone. &&Indeed, I wonder if it's down to marketing and studio clout.

 Not sure about the US, but in Australia *Arrival* got a huge release, and you could find it in any cinema. Lots of advertising. *Ex Machnia's* was much smaller comparatively, far fewer screenings. *Green Room* meanwhile had a tiny release typically reserved for cult hits.&&Ex Machina whoa, didn't think it only made 24m

The Disaster Artist was released at a bad time. Thor was in theatres, Shape of Water was just released. Star Wars out in the following weeks. &&They should try getting their films in more than 10 theaters when they come out&&Yeah, as much as I love Lady Bird, I don't think it's half the movie that Moonlight was. &&To be fair, they have like 1/100th the marketing as Hollywood  blockbusters, and usualy play in much fewer theaters. &&Yeah there’s nothing like the whole family sitting down and watching a guy give a Turing test then get murdered by a robot. The kids wouldn’t shut up about wanting to get all the toys afterwards &&It was in the Regal by me.&&It was at my local multiplex in downtown Seattle.&&It was at 1557 theaters one weekend so you need to move to a city without totally incompetent theater managers.  Every large theater with ten or more screens had it in my city.&&I doubt you'll get a good answer.&&I totally got a Ghost World vibe from it but not nearly as intriguing an atmosphere as GW.&&I'm one of those folks so I'll try to explain.

You're right that when you boil the story down to a sentence, it's not that original of a concept. Personally I love coming-of-age dramas so that's more of a positive for me, but I will try to be objective here.

Where the movie really sold me was in its execution. The first thing that came to my mind after I left the theater was that I felt as if I had spent a year in Christine's life, and I think I can attribute that feeling to two or three details:

 * I think it's fair to say that coming-of-age films are often written with tunnel vision with respect to the main character, where the parents and the supporting cast exist as devices to push or pull the protagonist through their journey. _Lady Bird_ is Christine's story, but every character has remarkable depth and finely-illustrated personalities of their own. I don't think it wouldn't be a stretch to write a movie through the lens of any other character's perspective, knowing what you already know about each character. Part of my affection for these characters is probably personal, because I can see attributes of Christine's parents in my own parents, and I know a Julie, and a Jenna, and a Kyle, and a Danny. Gerwig's ability to flesh out the world shows a deftness that is so unusual for films in this genre, because it's never about ""Christine vs. the world"", and no one is ever made to take sides-- the motivations for everyone are so much more complex than that.

 * The flow of the film feels very natural, which I believe is because of the editing and the pacing of the screenplay. It's instinctive, I think, for writers to want to punctuate the decisions of their protagonist that shape the course of the plot. ""Jane discovers [new thing], Jane falls in love with it, but suddenly, conflict! Jane must resolve conflict, everyone ends up happy, the end."" And while this structure makes the motivations of the characters very clear to the audience, it's not realistic. No one wakes up one day and decides to live a new life. You don't usually *decide* to be make a new friend, or likewise, end a friendship. The core changes in your life are often gradual and apparent only in hindsight, and the shocking thing about _Lady Bird_ was how effortlessly it depicts this. I didn't realize [that Christine and Julie had drifted apart until they had their confrontation in front of the school, and it was really sobering to me because I've regretfully drifted away from old friends just like this, and it wasn't intentional, it just sorta...happened.](#spoiler)

 * And of course, I can't credit Greta Gerwig with everything when everyone turned in stellar performances. Saoirse, Laurie Metcalf, and Lucas Hedges really surprised me with the strength they brought to their characters.

Movies are a very personal affair and nowhere does it show more than in these quieter character studies. It's probably to be expected that movies like _Lady Bird_ won't quite click with everyone. You can always convince someone of a movie's technical strengths, because those are objective, but you can't force a personal connection, and that connection was a lot of why I liked this movie. Hopefully my long and flourishy explanation at least made some sense in that respect.&&I'm with you. I liked it and I enjoyed Soarse Ronan's performance but it didn't wow me like a lot of other films this year.&&You didn't really ask a simple question though you asked a loaded one.  &&I liked it because it was so relatable to my teen years. It has a lot of well-defined characters who experience growth and go through things that those around me went through. Without spoiling anything, my favorite part of the movie was that it was a film about a teenager and she was just so perfectly *average*. She wasn't a super genius, overly witty, or precocious. I watched it and swear I was flashing back to my teen years.

It's definitely not an action movie, but it's a well paced look into a year into someone's life. I don't think it's dull at all, and really, really enjoyed it.&&Gotta love these smaller(?) companies who are making money with actual quality, with lower budgets, while so many studios are going with the over 100mil with everything. Blumhouse(?) I think is one from (mostly)horror side too. &&I was checking out their filmography and was genuinely surprised at the amount of great to amazing movies they've released in a relatively short period of time. They've released several of my favorite movies from the last 4 years. &&Holy crap, it's only been 4 years????&&They produce Lovesick also, which is on Netflix. One of the most underrated romcom shows out there. Love it so much.&&And Miramax.&&When you think about it, 10-20 films per year is so much. Release weekends are already pushing 3-4 new movies each, not counting limited releases. Eventually this over-saturation has to course correct the opposite direction, right?&&As of right now it's good. Next year they have some many unique and interesting movies coming out from cool artists. As long as they keep that up, great.&&No, some fake account on Twitter was made to start that rumor for some reason.&&Well hopefully A24 learns from the past. Plus the Hunger Games movies weren't that bad.&&The Hunger Games films were widely popular and well received by critics and audiences, so... editorializing much?&&2015 ""Birdman"", 2018 ""Lady Bird"" - why not?&&Did anyone hear the director Greta Gerwig get grilled by Terry Gross on Fresh Air? It was very awkward. She was like, your partner (Noah Baumbach) cast Dustin Hoffman in a recent film and you were in a Woody Allen film, so what do you have to say about this ‘Me Too’ movement?&&> biggest competition

Not *Call Me By Your Name*?&&The top 5 is all really close in my opinion and tough to call.

Lady Bird, Dunkirk, The Shape Of Water, The Post, and Three Billboards.

You can really make a case for any of those to win Best Picture.&&I don't know I liked Three Billboards just a little bit more &&Nominated for sure, but winning? I don't see it. Although, that may be my own wishes coming through as I thought the film was good, but over hyped in general.&&Hope it wins.&&Three Billboards is not its biggest competition imo and I believe Lady Bird will have a hard time stacking up to Call Me By Your Name and The Shape of Water. Both of those films seem more like Best Picture material.&&Preferential voting will seal the deal for it. It's not a divisive film. Near universal acclaim and the ranking won't deviate much. The only potential pitfall is the front runner status. Lala land had this and people turned against it. &&I'm pulling for Get Out best pic this year. &&Especially because it's a picture set in California, I could see heavy bias in the Academy towards it.&&I honestly didn’t think much of Three Billboards. &&Thanks for the heads up! I've been to one of their Scream Unseen screenings before, and got to see Get Out a whole month before it premiered over here.

That said, the closest Odeon that does Screen Unseen, is a train ride away and we'll be showing Lady Bird in the cinema where I work, so I might just wait and catch it for free. &&Wow sounds both extremely fun and aggravating at the same time. &&The way this is written makes it come off as an advertisment.&&April in Germany as well. Already excited tbh&&Yep, it's 5th April in Brazil too. D:&&I _work_ in the niche cinema! We won't be showing it until February. &&tbh a lot of it has to do with limited release. it was so hard for me to find a theater that was close to me playing good time. i had to make an effort to see this movie within the small time frame that it was showing locally.&&Good Time was unbelievable.&&Obviously but most of their films are limited releases or play on very few screens.

Ex Machina had the critical acclaim and eventually the screens after an expanded release which was why I was shocked it didn't do better.
&&just watched GOODTIME on a plane. great movie. felt sweaty and in urgent need of a drink and a smoke just watching it. important to remember cinema box office is no longer the be all and all. i downloaded from itunes. &&Might be due to marketing? I've never heard of good time, even looking it up I don't remember seeing any trailers or anything about it and I watch a lot of films.  I've seen everything else on that list.&&Well this is the first I’ve even heard of it and I’m the “movies guy” among the people I know and work with. &&Just wanted to share a photo I took of Robert Pattinson this summer talking about *Good Time*. I have experience with the Safdie Bros—*Heaven Knows What* (on Netflix still I think) was one of the first movies I saw covering a real
film festival. They are THE filmmakers to watch.

http://i.imgur.com/aAJ87KB.jpg&&I see a lot of pretty intense love for it on reddit but have never talked to someone irl who has seen it =\&&Was it considered a good movie?&&Was going to say this.  Saw ads for this on a bunch of social media.  Usually not a good sign&&Swiss Army Man was a wild ride.  I absolutely loved it.  I don't at all mind that most stories are slight alterations of a previous story, but it was so refreshing to sit down and honestly say ""I have no fucking clue where this is going.""&&I took my gf and 15 year old daughter. Gf was upset and crying at the end and my daughter and I asked the mostly empty theater if we had just been trolled. 
5/7 with rice?&&Honestly you gotta admit that one's understandably polarizing. Once you give it a chance though, man, it's a gorgeous movie.&&Such an amazing film&&I loved Swiss Army Man! I'd seen some of the trailers and had a friend who saw it at it's festival release though, so I kind of knew what I was getting into when it finally got on screens near me. It's such a different - i.e. downright weird - film though, and barely marketed for wide release as far as I could tell.&&I think it’s their best. &&Enjoyed Ex Machina. Didn't know about it until after it was released on blu ray lol&&It's always gotta be some touchy feely, emotional movie that wins best picture. Or some goofy ass musical. &&Room? What are you talking about. The movie about Catholic pedos won best picture. 

Besides, I think Mad Max or Room deserves best picture more than Ex Machina. Also looking back, I think even Sicario was more enjoyable than Ex Machina. 

Maybe give it best Original Screenplay though. Fuck Spotlight. I dont know how that was best picture. &&I saw The Disaster Artist last night and that was an Oscar-worthy performance by Franco. I honestly forgot it wasn't Tommy Wiseau for most of the movie.&&You’re all forgetting The Green Room&&Let's not forget The Witch, and it's modern counterpart, The Killing of a Sacred Deer. 
Two of my favorite horror movies, right behind Get Out.&&Holy sht.. This studio is now officially the  best.. . Didn't realize that almost the best stuff I've seen in recent years is by one studio... Amazing&&technically not a studio, a distribution company. &&It's because they're still wide distributing these films that would likely only be seen at film festivals and indie theaters. You're right, they aren't producing them, but they're pushing these fantastic independant movies into theaters they usually wouldn't be in. This is important, especially because the film business is so stuffed full of sequels and big budget movies these days. Of course, if they weren't distributing them then someone else might be doing it, but I think it's still something to applaud. Good point though, most people aren't aware of the fact that they primarily distribute.


Edit: Words&&Yeah, I expected it to be amazing from all the praise but came out of the theater disappointed. &&I was at the Tower also! The Sac High joke killed me, because I went to Sac High.&&I live in Davis. I lol'd. &&I totally used those excuses to not apply to Davis in high school haha&&It captured every high schoolers desire to leave Sac for college lol.  The Midwest of California line, the rich girl living in Granite Bay, so many accurate inside jokes about the region.&&They'll soon own Fox Searchlight so there's really no point buying a smaller version of the same thing.&&This is a fantastic way to describe it. It reminds me of a writing teacher I had in U. 


Someone in class said ""why would we write about something boring like that?"" The teacher said something like ""every subject in the world is fascinating if the story is told well.""


I've read so many books and seen so many movies I was barely interested in by the description and was blown away by.&&I didn't think I could relate to a teenage girl going to a Catholic school in Sacramento, California but I quickly realized that many of us go through the same experiences during adolescence. 

I like to describe Lady Bird as a more relatable Juno without the quirky, pretentious dialogue. &&This is what makes it so great to me, when my girlfriend told me a little bit about the plot/setting of the movie, I had no interest whatsoever.


I went along with her mostly because she always goes when I want to see some dumb action shit, and now she can't get me to shut up about.


I've recommended it to all of my friends and coworkers because it blew my mind. It was the least ""movie-like"" movie I've ever seen. It felt like a glimpse into someone's actual life.&&It's funny to hear guys say this, because women are so used to watching movies all about men. The reverse is not true - it's rare for men to have to empathize and relate to women in media. It's one of the things that contributes to men saying they don't understand women.  But I'm so happy this movie seems to be resonating for a lot of people, regardless of gender. &&Saoirse Ronan + Gerwig + best supporting cast of the year = guaranteed success.&&Yeah I honestly went in thinking I'd hate it. I like Saoirse Ronan and A24 though so I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It was so good, loved lady birds character arc.  &&See I found most of it quite boring, and I genuinely don’t understand why people hold this film in such high regard. There were a lot of weird choices made in the film that I couldn’t really understand. Meanwhile the film itself seems to lose the main plot for large chunks of time to focus more on the side plots, only to suddenly remind you that there is an over-arching story.

I want to like this film but it just won’t let me.&&Agreed! I only saw it because my mom wanted me to go with her to see it. I was expecting it to be bored or see something Too pretentious to enjoy. But it was great, even my dad and brother loved it. &&That's what makes a great director. I don't see Lady Bird winning Best Picture but Gerwig definitely deserves Best Director&&Her movie *Frances Ha* is fantastic. It really captures what it means to be young and already feel washed-up.&&I need to finish Swiss Army Man at some point. I too love Daniel Radcliffe as an adult actor these days.

If you want to get some more dark humorish, Daniel Radcliffe, you should watch the BBC short series, The Young Doctor's Notebook. Radcliffe costars w Jon Hamm in this story of a Russian doctor reflecting on his early days as a young doctor straight out of medical school during the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution. 

&&Both are fantastic. I get chills when I describe that movie to people.&&I'm a huge Manchester Orchestra/Andy Hull fan and just recently listened to the soundtrack. Needless to say, I've probably played it 30 times since.&&A L L   W E   E V E R   N E E D E D   W A S   A N   M O N T A G E&&Blumhouse is pretty much printing money at this point.&&""Bwaaaaaahh!""&&Oh sorry, I mean we may have to put Laaaaaady Bird down.&&F R O M B R O A D W A Y T O A R D E N&&Sacra-tomato &&Ah so it’s not a feel-good-by-the-end type movie? &&Wonderful &&I’d probably watch it. &&Honestly a filmmaker could really do something great with a dramatic retelling of Bird's early life, he grew up in a really rough situation and overcame adversity through hard work and sheer talent. He was a farmboy basketball prodigy who almost gave it up to live a normal life, but persevered to become one of the greatest to ever play.&&You know it'd be awesome.&&He looks like a Ukrainian woman who just removed her head scarf &&Larry Bird used to feel really disrespected whenever the opposing team assigned a white guy to defend him. He'd just torch the guy. 

""Ben Poquette!? Are you fucking kidding me!?"" - Larry Legend to Bulls coach Doug Collins while being guarded by Ben Poquette, a white dude. He put up 33 points by half time.

[And for those of you who don't know what Larry Bird looks like...](https://i.imgur.com/08Nq7bB.jpg)&&They are really the only studio who, no matter who the director is, i'll see the movie simply because they produced it. I have NEVER done that before A24.&&It must be studio clout and marketing, it's certainly not the quality of the movies. Arrival was pretty big in the US, but I didn't have a sense that Ex Machina was so much smaller. I guess I'm out of touch with how most people here about movies. &&Well-put! :) &&Thanks for the detailed response. I saw a lot of myself in this film too, nevermind that I'm a 42 year old guy. Seeing her in school, and doing musical rehearsals, I did think was really interesting to see, and was most relatable to me personally because I was definitely a theater kid growing up. 

That was presented in a way that seemed very real. Also, the ups and downs of friendships, trying on new personalities that end up not being very true to oneself. And I miss that a lot now, even though when I was done with it...I was pretty much done. 

What surprises me most is that this movie, in my mind, seems a pretty easy target for the folks who might be too cynical for this kind of story. Yet somehow, they embraced it in a very potent way. I wish these kinds of movies were more commonly supported in this way. And I think it's telling that I myself ended up going to see the film, partially because I was curious about the hype and why it had such stellar reviews.

I still think it's weird that it caught on the way it did. It seemed very personal, and an attempt to just tell a good story that wasn't necessarily predictable. I think of all the characters, I was really impressed by the Dad. He really caught my attention, and I hope to see that actor in more and better things.

I was scratching my head a little bit at the ending, not finding it to be very realistic. Then I remembered I moved to Los Angeles with almost nothing and I'm still here 13 years later. So who's to say?&&I heard she was considered for Rey in Star Wars, and I wish she had gotten the role. &&""Planet Money"" has a really cool episode on Blumhouse and their model to keep costs under control. 

They said they follow 4 rules:

1) Cheap locations - you'll notice almost all Blumhouse movies are set in really 'normal' settings like houses, woods, etc. No crazy expensive city shoot that are an expensive logistics nightmare or exotic locales.

2) Keep the amount of speaking roles to a minimum - apparently having a line is the difference between an actor's salary and an extra's salary, so you'll notice very minor roles like waiters, cashiers, etc not speak at all in Blumhouse movies.

Blum admittedly said that this point is really obvious when watching his movies if you are aware of it.

3) Work with actors that will take % of revenue and a smaller guaranteed salary than a huge guaranteed salary that can eat into your budget. This also forces the actors to give a shit about the financial future of the move.

4) Most importantly, the agreed upon budget before filming is final and there are no exceptions. He would rather have an unfinished film than one where budget costs balloon out of control because its whats needed to finish it. This sets an important precedent in his eyes to keep everyone budget conscious throughout the whole process and stops moral hazard.

He said outside of that, he's hands-off and lets the creative people make the creative decisions.&&Annupurna, A24, Blumhouse, Bleecker Street.

They're fun to root for.&&The perks of having ludicrously wealthy businessmen and women entering the indie film game. Nice seeing that money really push film along this way. &&Actual quality is right. I don't remember the first time I watched an A24 trailer on YouTube, but then all the recommendations were for other A24 pictures, and I was like ""who are these people, where did they come from, and why do ALL their movies look so good?""&&My professor is a producer over at BlumHouse and she says that you still need to be someone before they even consider giving you your money. 

They’re killing it though. But they have a bunch of rules when it comes to how they make their films to keep costs low. &&Those 3-4 new movies per week are mostly garbage aimed for teenagers. I'm all for indie films filling a quality niche that the major studios don't.&&It's not like they make just one movie though. Oversaturation isn't a problem.&&Woah! &&I felt that the Hunger Games movies got better with each one, and the books were the exact opposite. &&[deleted]&&2021 ""Birdperson"" to sweep the Oscars, calling it now.&&With Spotlight and Moonlight in between, I'm predicting Bird of Light to win overwhelmingly in 2019&&I was actually angry when Birdman won. While I liked the movie I felt Boyhood was so innovative and powerful. Birdman fell into that ""it's about Hollywood"" trope that Oscar voters love.&&I don’t think Terry Gross ‘grilled her’. All of the Fresh Air interviewees can opt to have questions and responses omitted if they’d prefer that sections of the interview not air. I attended the Marc Maron interview of Terry Gross in NYC and she mentioned this during thier talk.

Greta Gerwig gave great answers, and was open about how difficult the question was for her to answer. She also opted to keep her answers in the aired interview. 

Sexual harassment perpetrated by entertainment industry co-workers is the elephant in the room during many interviews in this current climate, it was refreshing to hear this addressed. It stopped the questions from sitting at the back of my mind for the rest of their talk, and Gerwig’s answers left me with more perspectives to examine.&&Oh man, I couldn't finish that interview. I respect Terry for taking the risk and going there though&&I love Terry and thought the interview with Greta was fascinating, but, yes, uncomfortable. I appreciated that I was very real - much more so than we typically get with people promoting their work. It was smart of Greta to be honest about what an awkward position she was put in, and to throw it back to Terry re: her admiration of Louis CK. The situations aren’t analogous, but I think it’s good to have these tough conversations about how we view the art in light of creators’ inappropriate and even predatory choices. I love Terry’s interview style for her skill with going to some of those uncomfortable places. &&Hoffman wasn’t accused of anything at the time of production (or even release), and the Allen situation is complex and places a slightly unfair burden on young actors trying to make it in the business. I don’t think she’s involved with much hypocrisy here or anything.&&I did find it awkward. I wanted to hear more about Lady Bird.&&Gold Derby has **Call Me By Your Name** as 8th best odds to win Best Picture.

Maybe it'll build more buzz soon since it's only now staring to expand.&&Yeah that makes way more sense. *Three Billboards* seems to have been underperforming this season actually, where awards are concerned. I haven't been able to see it yet, but I'm told it's fantastic.&&I would say Call Me By Your Name is it's biggest competition. &&Not if you believe SAG stats. Missing an ensemble nod at SAG is a huge indicator that it can’t win Best Picture (people said that it didn’t matter last year when La La Land missed cause it was a small ensemble but we saw how that turned out)&&>Dunkirk

Ehhh, it's definitely the most refreshing and mature Nolan film in a long time, and makes me very hopeful for his future films because he let go of so much that was holding his other films back and did something incredibly visonary and idiosyncratic, but I have a hard time picturing it as anything more than a nominee.&&Haven't seen Post or Billboards but Get Out, Shape of Water, Blade Runner, and Lady Bird have been 4 of my favorites this year&&Call me by your name?&&I'd say Call Me By Your Name has a better chance at winning than Dunkirk

I'd say either Call Me By Your Name, Shape of Water, Three Billboards (but not as much as the other 3) or Lady Bird are the ones that have the best chances at winning&&I've seen all of those but The Post. Is it any good?
&&why is lady bird getting so much acclaim? I liked the trailer and saw it in theaters but thought it was pretty average. &&You seem to be the only person who gets this. Like if you were to bet $50 on who it will be now, you probably won't be disappointed if you pick LB, but that doesn't mean it's a 100% lock. Everyone sating Call Me By Your Name are going to be sorely disappointed.&&It's so annoying when a movie comes out months later in your country compared to wherever it first opened...  It gets to a point where you can watch it first online!&&The thing is, it was still in 650+ theaters for 3 weeks but made pretty much no money. That's a pretty wide-ish release but had terrible per-theater-averages (~$500).

I guess it was maybe the marketing/release date that hurt it.&&This is the thing, man. I’d see all of their movies if I could, but they just don’t push them out, and when they do eventually run out they come and go with no fanfare because they don’t really publicize the limited release window while it’s there. &&I was gonna go see lady bird but it seemed to leave theaters quickly &&Yeah, I don't think it ever came near me. I didn't even hear about it until a few weeks ago, when some people were floating Robert Pattinson as a longshot Oscar contender.&&Call Me By Your Name is having the same sort of issue. The only difference between its success and Good Time is the buzz. The buzz works in favor with their limited release because people are more excited to see the film. I live in a major U.S. city and CMBYN is only showing for a week, and it is being shown almost a month after its initial U.S. release. Only time will tell if this will help or hurt the budget, but I'm sure that it'll get enough buzz for at least an Oscar nod.&&I wanted to see it but honestly forgot it came out and missed my window :/&&I paid for the whole seat but only needed the edge&&Never heard of this but just watched the trailer and now want to see it bad.&&Easily one of the most underrated releases this year.&&Don’t want to sound rude but i’m pretty sure the phrase is be all end all&&Did you get the screenplay with the iTunes download&&it was marketed alot more on indie music sites like Pitchfork, because it was scored by a well regarded electronic artist named Oneohtrix Point Never &&Yes definitely &&It's a pretty stellar film in my opinion. &&[deleted]&&By most people, yes. By me and a few other miserable bastards? No, it was very pretentious. Good eye candy though.&&On this sub, yes. The general view is that it was underwhelming, but worth a watch. 

Very generally speaking, it wasn't written well enough to keep pure sci-fi fans happy, and it wasn't interesting enough to entice those who aren't big sci-fi folk.

I'm happy I watched it, it was well made, well acted, well produced, but I don't think it was very well written. It ""looked"" great, but didn't feel it over 90mins.

I recommend watching it to anyone, just don't have the high expectations many had before it was released.

7.7/10 on Imdb sounds about right to me. I would have said 7.&&Yup&&It's pretty polarizing. I saw it with my gf at the time and her mom. Me and my gf loved it, honestly one of my favorite movies, but her mom despised it. &&Oh i totally forgot about Spotlight winning. Good movie but not as good as any of the other nominees honestly. &&It was also strangely inspirational. Which I did not expect &&The Room is being wide released in theaters on the 10th of January.
Let Tommy know how much you love his awful, wonderful movie. &&LOVE Green Room, one of my favourites. Googled Anton Yelchin immediately after it and was so sad.&&Oh heck yeah, Green Room's incredible. Patrick Stewart was scary as hell in that. 

Sure, he played a racist maniac, but he at least got to do more than just stand around and make poop jokes in a boring movie about smartphones.

God, A24 is just on fire right now. Free Fire, Florida Project, Moonlight and Lady Bird were all great. I still need to see Good Time and Disaster Artist.

Also, A Most Violent Year (another A24 film) doesn't get enough love. I think that film was Best Picture worthy.&&Loved The Witch. What an atmosphere they created, which is more disturbing to me than any cheap ""jump scare."" 

That first scene with the witch and the mortar and pestle has scarred me for life. &&Thanks for the mention of Killing the Scared Deer. The Witch is maybe my favorite movie in the last fews years....and Get Out favorite film this year. &&Seriously, as someone who doesn't consider himself a big movie guy but who goes out of the way to try to watch interesting/good movies somewhat often, I had no idea that so many of the movies I was really floored by over the past couple years came from the same source.&&I've never understood the need to ""relate"" to a character to enjoy a film. Most of my favourite films are about characters that couldn't be further from my experience - and that's kind of why i like them. I know my life already, I've lived it... show me something i couldn't possibly ever relate to, now thats interesting.&&You should watch more A24 movies then or even just indie movies. Lady Bird could be a gateway drug for you!&&For sure check out Boyhood if you haven’t then&&This is so true. &&I don't see it's main strength being story. At the end of the day, the ""story"" is a high school girl preparing for college. It's not all that fascinating. It shines as a character study. Or, rather, several character studies that are all really well done.

Lady Bird definitely isn't a ""oh what's gonna happen?!?"" movie. It's a ""let me dip into these people's lives for a couple hour and just experience it"" kind of movie. I guess it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but it held my interest pretty strongly the entire film.&&While I agree that the movie itself is basically flawless in execution, to me it felt a bit boring. I appreciated it, but I wasn't engaged by it. 

I enjoy Three Billboard significantly more. And A Ghost Story is my movie or the year. &&And Adam Driver is in it&&As someone who really likes Noah Baumbach, I didn't much care for *Frances Ha*.  Frances was such an unlikable and unrelatable character that it was hard to get very emotionally invested (similarly with *Greenberg*, although I thought that worked better as a film overall).&&I love Young Doctors Notebook! Did they ever make any more after the second season?&&I think the profits on the Paranormal Activity franchise are more than any other series by a long shot. Low budget horror done right is pretty much the Blumhouse MO. &&Really good podcast on their business model here - https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/29/521950337/episode-650-the-genius-behind-get-out&&They have been for years. &&F R O M T O W E R T H E A T R E T O G O L D E N 1&&I found it melancholy, but more nostalgic/sentimental than anything, tho. Good movie about family.&&It’s not depressing or anything but it acknowledges that it’s only after your teen years and leave home that you can start to properly appreciate your parents and that’s sad but it’s life.&&It is a very realistic feeling portrayal of a family that loves one another but have their problems still. The mother-daughter relationship in the film is one of its great strengths. It is not depressing but it is true-to-life melancholy where you grow to realize how much both your place and your parents are a part of you.

If a cry is okay, I think it would be a good movie to see with that group of people. I walked out of the theater after the film was over and called my mom. It engenders powerful (positive, in my case) feeling about family.&&It’s a coming of age story of a teen from a struggling family from Sacramento California. Would recommend. 

EDIT: it is also a period piece of the 2000’s&&Old Ukrainian women, that's a fine. &&I was lucky enough to live right behind an movie theater that predominantly showed independent movies when I was growing up. Now I rarely go see a mainstream movie. &&This is interesting! Can you link me to a source by chance? Or is this something I can google easily? Just want to read more into it. Thanks!&&Regarding point #2, there really needs to be a pay tier between background actor/extra($166/8hours), and day performer/speaking role($933/8).

The jump is unreasonable, and problematic for everyone involved.&&Number 4 had a really interesting exception made for Get Out. One of Peele's interviews about the reshot ending was like ""I went to Jason and got more money to reshoot it in the wake of current events"". The new ending was more respectful to current events and the scenario depicted.&&Churning films out like that is a clever move, stay profitable and refine your methods with each project, one can only really improve that way. the question then is does the extra turnover mean less constraints and slightly better movies, or pocket the cash and keep the model the same?&&When reading this in a neutral context,  I feel like this is kind of the way they should be made anyways.  Spread the risks and personal investment a little so the end product has a better chance of being made from the heart; of course you have to hope the crew is a good mesh or you still get crap.&&Sounds like a recipe for having your best people prove themselves under that system then GTFO to do bigger/better stuff where you aren't working under such restrictions.&&Blum also had a great interview recently on the Bill Simmons Podcast
https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2017/10/11/16461128/jason-blum-box-office-hits-storytelling-horror-films&&Is number 3 really “revenue” and not “profit”? If so that seems way more honest than profit sharing schemes which had resulted in Hollywood Accounting leading to massively profitable films not paying their royalties to actors. &&Yeah it's pretty easy to tell how some of the productions cut corners. So much natural light in recent indie flicks (Green Room, The VVitch, It Comes at Night)&&He also had a really good episode on The Nerdist. I hadn't even heard of the guy before it popped up on my podcast app and I really enjoyed hearing his views.&&It's a common misconception that having a line is what makes you an actor vs an extra. In reality, the difference is whether you're given direction by the director or not.

Extras are just wrangled en masse by one of the assistant directors. If the director gives you specific instructions on how to perform, then you're an actor. Having a line just means that you will almost certainly be instructed on how to say it. Someone playing a mute character, on the other hand, would still be an actor as the director would be directing other aspects of their performance.&&IIRC, they're the guys in charge of the FNAF movie, and that's actually pretty interesting to me.&&> 1) Cheap locations - you'll notice almost all Blumhouse movies are set in really 'normal' settings like houses, woods, etc. No crazy expensive city shoot that are an expensive logistics nightmare or exotic locales.

I love that, when a movie is written for it's budget.  Like Coherence is an amazing movie in just a house.  Or The Man From Earth.&&I would put Neon in there as well, they've had a nice year with I Tonya, Ingrid Goes West, Colossal and Beach Rats&&I honestly think Blumhouse is too major to be grouped with those now. Blumhouse himself pocketed 50-100 million this year. &&Blumhouse makes a lot of shitty movies. They work on volume to capture low budget outliers.&&Annapurna also funded What Remains of Edith Finch, which is one of the most interesting games I've played this year&&They've always exist in the films business, just hope this group can stay around a little longer than the previous.&&I personally don't care for Collins' writing style when it comes to books.  I think she really is at her best in television and film writing.  

The books never feel immersive.  The concept is excellent (granted, it's not strictly-speaking hers, but it's naive to act like that's unusual in writing).  However, the writing never made my heart race the way a story like that should.&&Well, “piece of shit” it entirely subjective. If it was an incredibly popular and well received movie that would mean that most people didn’t think it was a piece of. According to any objective measures though it was actually a good movie. &&God damn it Tammy&&""Birdperson forgives Tammy, but birdperson hates the universe that created the Tammy""&&BirdKid&&Fuck Tammy&&/r/BirdsWithArms: the movie&&That was unarguably an incredible year for cinema. What a tough pick for best picture, these were the nominees:

Whiplash, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Theory of Everything, American Sniper, The Imitation Game, Boyhood, Birdman, and Selma.

Personally I think Whiplash was the best movie of the year. In my opinion, it's a nearly flawless movie that so effortlessly displays its main themes. But really so many of those movies were incredible - I've seen all of them besides Selma and there all up on my list of the best films of the 2010s.&&Meanwhile I don't think Boyhood is anywhere near the caliber of film as Birdman. Boyhood felt like the epitome of formulaic to me and while the concept was noble, it didn't add anything at all to the experience to me in terms of the actual film. Hawke and Arquette were fantastic though.

Meanwhile Birdman was a bold, bizarre, and unusual film unlike pretty much anything I've seen. I loved the Academy went with the super weird film for once. And no offense but I think it's ridiculous that people continue to discount the film simply for being ""about actors"". I think it's something like 2 or 3 films in the history 70 year history of the Academy Awards have won Best Picture that have had *anything* to do with Hollywood so where this silly strawman argument comes from I'll never know. I can understand Birdman not being someone's cup of tea, but when the main complaint is ""it's about Hollywood and so that's why it won"" that's just lazy. 

Did ""12 Years a Slave"" win JUST because it's about slavery? How about Schindler's List? Did that win JUST because it's about the Holocaust? Or any of the dozens of war films or biopics or that have won Best Picture? You can marginalize pretty much any movie if you want to parse it out like that, though why anyone ever wants to is beyond me.&&I felt the same way for the 90 seconds that ""La La Land"" won.&&Boyhood sucks don’t give me that&&But do you think it was the right place/time for that question? It felt out of the blue for me. It’s one thing as a journalist to push for tough questions, but it didn’t feel appropriate to go after Greta like that.

It’s so hard to make it in Hollywood, and Greta has managed to carve out a niche as an actress and now director. Why should she be on trial for not having a stronger stance against harassment?

I think these celebrities have to walk on eggshells or risk being blacklisted. Also tons of stars still work with Woody Allen so I don’t think it’s fair to single her out for that.

I like Terry, but just don’t understand why she wasn’t trying to be more supportive of a female director who’s debut was awesome.

Sorry for the rant.&&Last year you could have said the same about Weinstein. Everyone in the industry knows when these things happen and say nothing. People are willing to sell their humanity for fame and fortune, but want to pretend they didn’t. I’m glad the question was asked. If you are willing to condone harassment or bury your head in the sand so that you can get famous, then you should be willing to admit it. That’s it. &&This is a bit misleading, because the top 7 of the race are so tightly packed (I'm seeing Call Me By Your Name as 7th). By their estimate, Lady Bird is the favorite with 6.5 to 1 odds, and Call me by Your Name is at 9 to 1 odds. That's a fair difference, but not as much as you'd expect from ""1st vs 7th"" place. It's just a really tight 7 horse race.

Anyways, what exactly are Goldderby's methods for predicting this? Are people actually betting on this result? When there's money on the line, and it's an efficient market, the betting odds will basically always represent the best community consensus of the odds (otherwise smart sharks would bet large amounts on a positive expected value and shift the line back) However, if it's just an online game where people place their predictions,  there's no real reason to assume that this doesn't just reflect popularity, or other such biases (again, when real money is on the line, there is very good reason to think that the line is not systemically biased in such an obvious fashion). So how exactly does Goldderby come up with their odds? Do people bet real money on it? &&It's pretty good, but it's heavier than I expected. Might've been mislead by marketing in that respect, but what the hell, it got my butt in the theater so its job was done.  &&It is completely wonderful. &&I absolutely loved it. It's dark, but poignant, and the acting is top notch.&&It’s ok. Def not BP worthy IMO.&&Three Billboards is my film of the year, I think you should definitely check it out. Went and saw it 3 times (thanks, moviepass) and loved it more with each watch.&&Wow, I did not care for it at all. McDonagh seemed to going for the feeling of a Coen brothers movie but Three Billboards veered too wildly from slapsticky humor to really dark violence with no control of the overall tone. I did like In Bruge so I know he can do black comedy but this one just did not work for me. 

The big speech she gives to the priest about the molestation scandal in particular fell completely flat and felt like speechifying by the author. And the redemption arc of the racist cop felt cheap and unearned. Oh well, to each his own. &&Well Three Billboards is pretty divisive among critics &&I would have to agree. I certainly enjoyed *Lady Bird* more, but I can entirely understand the toss-up this will constitute for many critics.

Relatedly, [Timothee Chalamet right now](https://media.giphy.com/media/94EQmVHkveNck/giphy.gif)&&Same. It felt really incomplete as a movie. &&It's style was innovative and unique, and cinematically it was an incredible movie - with great audio, great acting, great cinematography, and an inticing story. 

It really is just as good as these deep heavy-themed dramas that have won best picture exclusively for the past 5 years (Moonlight, Spotlight, Birdman, 12 Years a Slave, Argo, The Artist). 

I'm not saying that these movies aren't great or important, but it's only 1 subgenre in cinema, and it's not exclusively better than the other ones. There are stand out films in other genres that never even get nominated for best picture, simply because they aren't a part of the right genre in cinema.

I don't understand why Hollywood thinks dramas that tackle heavy themes should exclusively win the Oscars every year. Dunkirk is a unique and innovative film that really is completely different from any other war film out there, and yet it still manages to keep the audience enticed for 2 hours.&&Maybe just chalk it up to different strokes? I felt that in addition to being hilarious it evoked such a strong emotional response from seeing two people who so clearly love each other being unable to express how much they care and demonstrating why LadyBird in particular was unable to do it.&&It really didn't get promoted very well. I rented it one weekend and loved it. I came into the office on Monday and not one of my co workers had heard of it. &&Dumb question but what was out at the same time as it? &&It'll probably get another extended release once Oscars come along&&It was so so so good. The trailer had me intrigued but the movie was ten times better.&&i rented it. great vibe.

Like The Witch, it's a family drama with supernatural forces. At first I didn't like it because it was so vague. But the more I thought about it, it turned into a modern Horror without revealing any secrets. It's absurd, and frustrating, but totally worth the watch.&&Not meant as a direct dig at Go_Habs or even shlopman (below) but let's all beware the dangers of ""relatable"" as a litmus for quality or worthiness. Each of our lives is but one among billions and billions. (Trillions?) ""Relatable"" should be the exception, not the expectation.

For some perspective:
http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/04/11/relatable_the_adjective_is_everywhere_in_high_scchool_and_college_discussions.html&&Exactly. Writing good a character is not about making them 'relatable' or worse 'likable'. It's about making them authentic, believable and multi-faceted, thereby evoking basic human empathy. &&I'm glad I'm not the only person who feels this way about Frances Ha. I found the character (and the entire movie) to be insufferable, and I had my reservations about Lady Bird but surprisingly ended up loving it. Lady Bird has her moments where she's annoying too, but there are at least parts of her that you can relate to and make her endearing. For me, there was none of that with Frances Ha.&&**Total Budget**: $28M

**Total Box Office**: $890M

Not bad.&&They give their directors very strict budgets, not a penny over.  But the trade off is they get complete creative control, no notes on what's trending or that actor can't sell a movie.  It's also allowed some directors breakout of directors jail: see [Rob Cohen](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/11/439632877/episode-650-the-scariest-thing-in-hollywood) and [M Night Shyamalan](http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt4972582/)

Edit: a word&&It's a good strategy. They pump out a lot of low-budget but interesting films. The ones that do poorly get close to making their money back since the budget was so low, and the few that do well make more than enough money to cover losses of the other films. &&Who needs the golden gate when you've got the guy west? &&https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/11/439632877/episode-650-the-scariest-thing-in-hollywood&&If you don’t know Planet Money, it’s one of the best podcasts around - and the only show that can make economy exciting.

That having constraints made The Visit a much better film, and that he thought the experience made him a better director. &&Planet money is best podcast! &&Where I'm from, in between Principal and Background/Atmosphere Actors is Actor (less than 6 lines) and Bit part (People who interact with Principal actors but don't have lines, so a waiter with no lines). But it varies depending on Unions&&I thought one or two lines didn't matter, but once you have three lines you ""count"" as an actor and can apply for SAG membership.&&What was the original ending?&&Based on several conversations I’ve listened to Jason Blum have these last couple years, I don’t think they have any desire to change the model for their primary slate of films. One of the other huge things about making movies for this price is that Blumhouse gets to have a cush overall deal with Universal as a distributor, but the small ball model keeps the studio hands off, because their time is better spent wrangling their tentpole films always trying to fall apart.

However, I do get the sense that Jason Blum really, really wants to make a massive, gigantic budget movie, but he’s so cautious that he’ll never do it until it’s a slam dunk project with a filmmaker that he trusts and has worked with on another film before.&&>Spread the risks

That's the thing though: studios are moving to minimize risk with big IPs and so are loathe to share the pie with people.

And, when it works, it works: Disney/Marvel has a ton of leverage against any creator and it's almost certain no one will ever see RDJ money again. They can pay less and lock actors into long-ass deals cause they know their products will likely have a base level of success. &&IIRC he's open to giving director's he's worked with before and have made him money bigger budgets. The Visit was $5m and Split was given a bigger budget because Shyamalam proved himself. I can't remember if Glass is being produced by him but I'd imagine it's a similar deal.&&Haven't seen the VVitch yet but in both of the other two I found the natural light to be a welcome change of pace.  Neither one felt ""low-budget"" in the way I generally think of low-budget trash, but more like a naturalistic way to make a movie that is a breath of fresh air in these CGI times.

NIGHT

CRAWLER&&American Sniper, The Theory of Eveything and The Imitation Game are really not up to par. Three pretty perfunctory biopics, even without taking into account the political weight of Sniper.&&You also got to remember Interstellar, Inherent Vice, and Nightcrawler came out that year.&&American Sniper is nowhere near the others&&I agree that Whiplash was the best movie that year. I disagree however that American Sniper and The Imitation Game should be mentioned with it. Those two were a tier below Whiplash, Boyhood, and Birdman.

The Imitation Game was Oscar bait and American Sniper was propaganda, though it was very entertaining.&&And outside of those:

Gone girl

Night Crawler

The Lego Movie

Interstellar

I enjoyed La La Land but was really happy that the academy awarded a movie that took risks. &&I'd argue that Boyhood is the best movie I've ever seen, so I'm perfectly fine saying that it should have won regardless of what the competition is. I'm not saying that Birdman is bad, but I just wouldn't take it over Boyhood.&&She's a journalist, ""Me Too"" is all over the news, it's not her job to be supportive.  It's her job to ask interesting questions that are on her mind and the minds of her listeners.  I'm sure that in the next few months, if she has an actor or actress who worked with Woody Allen on her program, they'll receive the same line of questioning.&&What's the ""right time"" to ask these questions?&&> Also tons of stars still work with Woody Allen so I don’t think it’s fair to single her out for that.

Everyone's been getting attacked for working with him recently. Selena Gomez, especially, but also Elle Fanning. I haven't heard Timothee Chalamet getting any but he's just gotten the spotlight.&&AFAIK there weren’t really even rumors about Hoffman until the allegations came out. What he did was horrible but not nearly as obvious or systemic as what Weinstein did. It’s 100% possible that nearly no one knew.&&It's funny you say that because it was a lot funnier than I expected, it takes it time and slows down at moments but it had a lot more laughs than I expected.&&Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, Hostiles.

Decent 2-month run for him lol.&&Lady Bird was good, but it didn't have the same affect on me as Call Me By Your Name. I saw Lady Bird in theaters a couple weeks ago and enjoyed it, but I didn't really 'get it'. I watched Call Me By Your Name a few days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. Both are certainly deserving of a Best Picture nod for sure and I wouldn't be surprised if Lady Bird did win, but IMO, I'd say Call Me By Your Name as the edge (also depending on other nominations).&&Idk I would say BR 2049 deserves it more than Dunkirk&&I think promotion was definitely an issue. I had heard of it, but it looked like some dumb stoner/nostalgia movie. I haven't seen it, so idk maybe it is, but sounds like people here have high praise for it. 

Edit: Nevermind, I was thinking of a different movie, only goes to make the point even more. &&I learned about it from reddit, and none of my friends had heard of it. If I didn't see a /r/movies thread about it, I still wouldn't know it existed today.&&I am pretty big into movies, but don't follow film studios directly or /r/movies and this is the first time I've heard of the movie, so you may have a point&&Mainly Fast and Furious 7 and Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, as well as Unfriended.&&That's essentially my point. It managed to be too ""mind blowing"" for some, while also offering nothing new for others.

Better writing would have provided better explainations for the mind blown, and more new content for the tech folk.

This needs to die. &&It really depends which specific SAG-AFTRA union contract(there are many derivations) the movie or TV show is operating under.  And of course, commercials are a whole 'nother ballgame.

Generally though, in TV and movies, whether or not you speak is the dividing line between background actor and principal performer.

&&Have not heard of Beach Rats but I’ll check it out. &&Totally gonna check out this movie now, thanks!&&Yeah because marketing a really heavy story about an abusive relationship as a goofy rom-com is sure to lead to great word of mouth.

And it's been a good year for movies.&&Wait.. as someone who doesn't follow oscars. Did The Imitation Game and American Sniper get nominated to best pic over Nightcrawler???&&That movie tore me a new one. Loved it but goddamn... &&Yeah, also they’re just Hollywood imo, they tell interesting tales in a pretty good way, but other than that there’s nothing more too it. Whiplash, bird man, boyhood, each of them had a lot of depth to them behind the exterior of the plot &&I watched Imitation Game earlier this year for the first time and was astounded by how bad it was. It was so bloated with shitty big-budget-self-serious-lowest-common-denominator-drama tropes that I almost couldn't believe it wasn't satire.

-plucky female lead, charmingly brilliant because she's too clueless to realize it, cloyingly innocent--""oops, did I get the highest score??"" pouty lips

-a by-george-I've-got-it! eureka moment in an unexpected setting in which the main character, who is supposed to be the world's greatest expert at whatever the fuck, is inspired by some pleb's unwittingly relevant or ingenious insight, and the main character rushes back to the lab to fiddle with knobs and impatiently explain to a befuddled secondary character his revelation in elementary terms meant to sound sophisticated.

-a begrudging rival gradually becomes a close friend through increasingly frequent displays of mutual generosity and respect

-the most vanilla secondary character, but not the most minor, is a spy/turncoat/secret bad guy.&&American Sniper never deserved the accolades it received. It was unimaginative jingoistic drivel that boiled down to being ""Enemy at the Gates,"" from the Nazi's perspective. &&Not sure if typo, but the phrase is ""up to par""&&Yeah, it had a lot of punchy moments, but, for example, in addition to the mother's grief that's in every trailer, there's a whole other family and group of friends/coworkers that's grieving for a whole different reason.  It's a movie about grief, and while people do respond to grief in a whole lot of different ways including humor, it's not an easygoing movie. Partly it's about the 3-4 nice people in a town full of shitbirds. &&How bout my man Lucas Hedges having another strong year?&&This is really funny to me because I basically had the inverse response. I really enjoyed both films, but gun to my head, *Lady Bird* wins without a moment's hesitation. Power of art, man.&&Nah it's the entire Paranormal Activity franchise (six films).&&I used to like Freakonomics alot. Even read their two books. Then they did a special on the Koch Brothers. The episodes came off sounding like a paid commercial meant to humanize the Kochs and made no mention of the obvious effects they have had on ecomonics.  Unsubscribed immediately after that.&&Love Freakonomics, but only after I binged on all of Planet Money was I interested enough to dig a bit deeper into economics (I believe Frekonomics is a lot more nerdy, in the best way possible).&&The Weeds is the GOAT podcast.&&Maybe in the vein of 'if you like this you'll like that', but I started on Slates 'working' about interesting jobs people do. Some really great ones. &&[deleted]&&That's the case for a lot of directors. Look at George Lucas, when he was under the gun with the original star wars, he made a classic. Then, as a producer, he was fighting tooth and nail to get empire done.

The prequels? Everyone was a yes man, no one challenged him and he had absolutely no problems getting them made. That conflict makes things better when you have to fight for it.&&Thanks, that's good to know! I work with ACTRA (The Canadian Equivalent) so a few things are different I guess. &&Sorry to get off-topic here, but is there a minimum rate for New Media?

That's still insane profit though &&yeah i gave up on freakonomics after they would just have episode after episode of how wonderful libertarians are and how they have all the best ideas and it was just boring to listen to libertarian propaganda over and over&&That was an... odd interview, it made me wonder about their bias, and my own. I wish that they had someone else to challenge Koch more, because while I appreciated the angle that he's a guy who's done his research and wants to make the world a better place (everyone's the hero of their own story) I didn't appreciate that it stopped there. There's a lot of economic policy from the Republicans that DOESN'T sound like it fits with what Koch was saying in the interview, and I don't understand how Koch would rationalize that. I didn't like how Koch claims not to care much about the culture politics that the Republicans won on, when they can't win on the economic policy he believes in. I earnestly resent that he did not support Hillary Clinton in the last election, while still claiming to hold the best interest of the country at heart. 

I have noticed I listen to Freakonomics less since that episode, but I'm not willing to throw the baby out with the bath water when I've learned so much from them. Shit, even when it's the Republican line, I'd much rather hear and challenge that than lose it all together. I enrolled in economics classes after graduating purely because of the interview about the negative externalities of pollution (the economic solution to climate change). &&Freakonomics is a good book. I've heard the radio show a few times and like it too. They probably got a nice hefty cash infusion from Koch for doing a positive piece on them.

"First Poster for Comedy-Thriller 'Best F(r)iends' - Starring Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, and Paul Scheer",26599,7h37o0,https://i.imgur.com/fkBKZTY.jpg,1125,1512228555.0,,"I saw ""The Room"" on Thursday and Greg Sestero was there. I asked why he decided to work with Tommy again and he said ""Because there's no role more perfect for Tommy than a 100 year old Mortician."" 

Edit: grammar &&Not sure why my first thought was that they look like they have some serious sexual tension...&&First reunion between Wiseau & Sestero since **The Room**.

Description:

When a drifter (Greg Sestero) is taken in by a peculiar mortician (Tommy Wiseau), the two hatch an underground enterprise off the back of the mortician's old habits. But greed, hatred, and jealousy soon come in turn, and their efforts unravel, causing the drifter to run off with the spoils and leaving the mortician adrift. An expedition across the South West introduces wild and crazy characters through a series of twisted and dark foibles as both men learn a valuable lesson about friendship and loyalty.&&It feels a bit like they are trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice, but I'll reserve final judgement for when I actually see it. &&“Johnny’s my best f(r)iend”

“I know, he’s your best f(r)iend”&&Paul Scheer probably did it just to have at least one podcasts ready in the queue&&Please tell me the line ""But you're my best friend!""

Is said about 14 times.&&So we're getting the Disaster Artist pt. 2 in a few years? &&This should be good.&&I thought it was Zac Efron on the right&&If you've seen anything Wiseau has done post The Room, you'll know he now is trying far too hard to be 'funny' because he has no idea the joke is on him. Unfortunately this won't even be 'so bad it's good' good. &&Sestero is breaking character even on the poster, with that smirk&&I'm calling it now. They're gonna try to push the ""so-bad-it's-funny"" shtick from The Room, and it's gonna fail and just be plain old bad&&It’s not a good movie. It’s naaaaaaawwwt. Oh hi reddit!&&Does anyone know the story behind why Paul Scheers character is named Malmö? Guess nothing should suprise me since it's a movie starring Wiseau. But it's my hometown so it caught me off guard.&&Wait! did this move come out&&I like that they're piggybacking off of Disaster Artist buzz. Tommy don't give a fuck.&&I've never heard of a movie described as a ""comedy-thriller"" before.&&hahaha what a story mark!&&Calling it now. Zac Efron and Willem Dafoe are going to play in the Franco directed movie for the highly anticipated sequel. The Disaster Artist 2: Disaster Strikes Disastrously... Again&&I'm still waiting for Tommy to play a serial killer in a slasher flick. It would be perfect.&&I went to the a screening of this at beyondfest in LA. It’s better than you would expect. I’m excited to see it again, but apparently the version I saw had different music than the final one will. It’s also crazy how young the director is. He seemed like a normal dude at the q&a they did after the screening.&&Just saw it two nights ago! Fun film!&&Well at least James Franco will never run out of material &&Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZXdU3iuAyI

Makes it seem like Tommy has become a much better actor since The Room. While Greg is...still Greg.&&What happened to Greg's face?&&Interesting, they're going for a Nicholas Sparks-style poster.&&Few other countries would give acceptance to a person like Wiseau, as the States has done. I know some of it is tongue-in-cheek, but the money he's making is real. Pretty cool bunch of people overall, Americans.&&duuuuude two questions:


1.) is this real?


2.) are they gay lovers?&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujfDtlEwFBk      Myyyyyy looooooord.&&Why the parenthesis,  (r)?&&Saw the trailer before The Room last night. It looks bad but not like hilarious bad&&Can Rotten tomato score goes negative? please give us an exception just for this ^^^^^^^^^^^^^lol&&This is gonna be a disaster. Can't wait to watch a YouTube breakdown of it. &&Oh hai&&Wait...thi- this is real?&&Oh hi greg&&Written by, directed by, produced by, starring Tommy Wiseau&&hes making another movie? can't wait
&&I think they may be low key lovers. They insisted on sharif hotel room for visiting the movie. And just how Franco talks about them being super close to this day and the facial expressions he makes. Idk though. Reviews for this is that it's a decent movie. &&I'm so happy this movie is coming out soon, and I love Lisa so much.&&This reminds me of my favorite movie title, *My Best Fiend*, a documentary by Wernor Herzog about working with Klaus Kinski.&&I’ve seen it at an advanced screening in London a couple of months ago (with Tommy and Greg present).  It’s a good movie if you are a fan of the Room.  However it’s Not a good film in its own right.  A bit of homage was paid to the room at times (a fantastic basketball scene between Tommy and Greg).  &&Tommy Wiseau made another movie? For real? 

Just...erm...wow. 

&&Milk it&&Why does Greg Sestero look like a porcelain doll now?&&Here’s the trailer 

https://youtu.be/rZXdU3iuAyI

Wow. &&No.&&Hahaha, what a story mark&&Okay, Tommy has to be a vampire in this.&&Wait, Greg Sestero actually wanted to work with Wiseau again???&&""Oh, hi Mark.""&&I did naaht!&&I don’t understand the title.&&I'm sure the disaster artist will go very much into detail, and I'm not entirely ignorant of it, but don't they seem like the oddest of friends? Like why is this 50-something real close with this 20 or 30-something no matter what&&I'm so happy I have you as my BEST F(R)IEND, and I love Lisa so much.&&They ripped off a Werner Herzog documentary for the title. That seems appropriate somehow.&&O hai Mark.&&Typical Tommy: didn’t think we’d get it if he left the “[R]” out. &&This was surely the most amazing drama ever written. &&Very excited, I loved the room and I can't wait to get some more tommy action.&&I literally just watched the room for the first time like a few hours ago. 0/10 wood strongly recommend&&You're tearing me apart, Greg!&&> Tommy Wiseau in a comedy

Yeah, he's definitely trying to take advantage of the recent attention he's had, and this being labelled as a comedy will now give him even more of an excuse to claim people genuinely like the movie when they laugh *at* it.&&Oh hi cineworld!&&Wiseau? Uh oh. I hope there aren’t any 15 minute long sex scenes.&&How **DID** this get made?&&I kind of resent getting caught up in all this, but given the BTS movie coming out, I now want to see *The Room*, and this looks intriguing.&&Is this real Tommy or James Franco Tommy?&&This is either going to be surprisingly good, an all-out hot mess that rivals The Room in being so bad it's good, or be so bad that it's embarrassing.   &&Looks more like a romance/drama. They are getting there Target audience all messed up.&&This can't be real right? Dear god, if it's real I need to light the fires, my people must know!!&&Oh dear god no!&&Having seen this when they showed it in London in September, I'd advise all of you to see it in a crowded screening. The movie is not like the Room where it's so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. However, it makes for quite a communal experience. The anticipation of waiting for an awful Wiseau delivery combined with all of us laughing when he did made it all worth it. We were all feeding off each others' anticipation and laughter, which kept us going and it was what made the experience. On its own the film is just a chore.  &&Saw it last night, was very funny!  Would recommend &&Calling it now. It’s a prequel to the room. &&The much anticipated second entry in the Wiseau Cinematic Universe&&I have the strangest feeling that this might actually be legitimately good. &&$$$ we sharknado now&&say what you want about tommy wiseau but he made it in hollywood, in a way. &&Why would anyone cast Tommy Wiseau in their movie? They have to know that what they make can't have any critical acclaim or be genuinely enjoyed for what it is by audiences - the man can barely speak english, let alone act. Sure, people will also watch it because he is in it, but only to see the trainwreck that is his acting. 
Just by this casting choice, you make sure that your film is never more than a joke - which seems incomprehensible to me, given how much effort goes into making a feature-length movie. &&You’re tearing me apart, Lisa! &&Greg came to Iceland and had a screening of the rough cut and I saw it then. I'm guessing that if you're reading this thread then you know what it's about and if you know what it's about you're probably going to like it. I mean if you like Tommy Wiseau then how can you not? Greg basically wrote a movie for him and that's what you're getting. &&>*comedy thriller*

 this is a thing?&&YES&&Oh, hi Mark.&&Cheep cheep&&oh hi mark.&&Who who and who?&&Seeing a screening in a few weeks of the room with Greg, and the next night a q&a and live read of the first draft of The Room with Greg and a bunch of local actors.  Tickets for disaster artist on Sunday.  Cannot. Wait.  &&Whoa in Houston? I had friends that went and saw it there. Small world.&&>a 100 year old Mortician

Wait, what? Why isn't this mentioned in the synopsis? It makes it like a 141 and 2/3 better! &&His reasoning for working with him in his book is quite funny. He thought Tommy looked so bad in his theatre class that he would look incredible in comparison when side by side. Another reason was that Tommy was an unchained free spirit that thought thought he was a genius and Greg wanted some of that to rub off on him&&This was my thought, he's made for a role like that&&He probably said than&&Don’t worry I thought the exact same thing. I think it’s because it looks exactly like a poster for a romcom.&&Anyway, how's your sex life?&&Greg better watch his belly button or Tommy's gonna fuck it.&&My partner watched The Room for the first time two days ago, and her first question was ""So the director is in love with the blonde guy, right?"" Too many adoring, lingering shots.&&It seriously looks like it ought to have ""based on the novel by John Green"" or ""based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks"" on it somewhere.&&If you read Greg’s book you’ll find out that’s exactly what it is. &&Did you happen to read The Disaster Artist? There's some *serious* homoerotic sexual tension between Greg and Tommy. 

Casting Dave Franco as Greg opposite James Franco was a weird choice in light of that. Unless they remove the homoerotic undertones in the Tommy-Greg relationship, which would make it a tad duller.&&YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE  YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE YOU ARE MY ROSE &&Well... Tommy does call Greg ""baby face""...&&OTP&&Because they probably do. &&Doesn’t hurt that Sestero is very attractive. &&It looks like it’s based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. &&While reading the Disaster Artist I spent a good chunk of it wondering when Tommy would get up the nerve to invite Greg to bed. This poster just seems to be natural progression.&&From the side, he looks like a Tammy&&Keep your comments in your pocket!&&“I did not suck his dick, I did naht....oh hi Cock”&&*I just like to watch you guys...*&&> a peculiar mortician (Tommy Wiseau)

Now you are talkin'&&I saw this at a pre release screening in London a couple months ago, not a movie that I could really recommend. While *The Room* was so bad it was good this is just a plain terrible movie. &&""I did naught touch the dead body. I did naught. Oh hai, Steve""&&haha wadda story &&> First reunion between Wiseau & Sestero since **The Room**

How on Earth can you neglect its theatrical production!?

https://youtu.be/Rqz3vrkIOhU&&If you read this in Tommy's voice, it works very well&&Tommy Wiseau is really getting the last laugh from the James Franco movie.&&Sestero is in a really strange position of being Wiseau's Watson.&&You had me at peculiar mortician&&Definitely building off buzz from the Disaster Artist&&Despite his efforts to label The Room as a ""dark comedy"" or whatever, I don't think Tommy has the self-awareness to try make a movie in any way but seriously.&&That's my first instinct too, but I think this shows some promise of success. Tommy is playing a ""peculiar mortician,"" which is the one occupation I could see him portraying. Plus, having a mainstream comedian like Paul Scheer to reign everything in gives me hope.&&I mean it's not like they are going to ruin The Room&&I saw it. There was no lightning caught&&If this turns out to be a legit best picture nominee and we all realize that Wiseau has been playing the long con...&&Strike while the iron is hot.

Edit: Friends/Fiends. Thanks. I assumed it was like stuff on Reddit where (f) is female and (m) means male when posting since they're looking sexually at each other.&&He will actually know how this got made.&&Everyone is talking about Wiseau but I fucking love Paul Scheer. He always had the best improvisation out of the guys in the League (and that's saying something when you're improing with Nick Kroll and Jason Mantzoukas).


There's this one scene where he is obsessed with his home made hummus that he keeps forcing into the conversation that cracks me up everytime.

I wouldn't too much thought into the meaning behind any of the scenes. &&I use Plex as a way to have all of my movies on a server and a couple years ago, my wife and I ""bought"" Furious 7 for our Plex server. And the great thing about Plex is that it allows you to edit most of the information about the film that matters (director, MPAA rating, genre) including the cover/poster of the film to show the movie on the server. Well we choose this poster where it's black and white poster with Paul Walker's character looking at Vin Diesel's character, who is looking down (and they are both in tuxedos) so if you ignore the title of the film, the poster looks like a poster for a film about this really heavy LGBT themed drama that is more depressing than Blue Valentine (which I shit you not will be the final nail in a failing relationship). My wife and I laugh everytime we scroll through our Plex library and we see the movie in our library because we just see these two men in a highly ambiguous emotional state that could totally be pulled off in a depressing drama about a failing relationship.&&...a ripoff of the 1999 film *My Best Fiend* about the contentious relationship between director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski?&&Listened to the disaster artist on audiotape last week and saw it in theaters last night. There’s a scene where Tommy says to Greg, “don’t you want to share the bed?” The audience gasped, thinking about the two brothers interacting that way.

Btw, the book was amazing to listen to. Greg nails Tommy’s voice so well. &&I saw the film a couple of weeks back and there is a very subtle hint at that but otherwise it's not there. Still the funniest film I have seen in a long time though&&YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST YOU ARE POT ROAST&&Tbh Greg kinda does have a chubby face. Seems to me that they're just an unusual pair of best friends. &&*Cue dramatic closeup to his face*&&Fuck Tammy&&Right? Way more believable for Wiseau than a fucking ~~lawyer~~ banker.

Edit: been a while since I've seen it. Thought he was a lawyer.&&also maybe he is vampire&&Oh hi body. Ha ha ha ha.&&Honestly one of the most appropriate casting choices I've ever heard.&& I got a question about you morticians. You bang the dead bodies? I imagine stuff like that goes on all the time. I mean, I don't give a shit. If I was dead you could bang me all you want. I mean, who cares? A dead body is like a piece of trash. I mean, shove as much shit in there as you want. Fill me up with cream, make a stew out of my ass. What's the big deal? Bang me, eat me, grind me up into little pieces, throw me in the river. Who gives a shit? You're dead, you're dead!&&Literally the role he was born for&&Actual mortician here.

...how on Earth would he be a good fit? Who the hell would trust him with their dead loved ones?&&I watched an advance screening, it was not in the so bad it is good territory and just moving on to ""pretty bad, but better than the emoji movie""

In fact, can I get that on the poster? ""Better than the emoji movie"" - Some guy on Reddit.&&Aw I did the same thing and really enjoyed it. I guess if you were hoping for The Room level of quality then it'd be disappointing, but I tried to take it as a totally separate thing that Tommy happens to star in.&&I started the room today, but couldnt finish it. I made it to the third sex scene I think. How many more of those god awful scenes with terrible music  are there after the first 30 minutes?&&I loved it, but maybe i saw a different cut of the film. it was great to see a film that plays on the friendship of Tommy and Greg, and damn it was legitimately hilarious. I legit love Tommy Wiseau, so maybe I'm a bit biased but i had a smile on my face throughout almost the entire film.&&Tommy's comedic timing is, uh, actually pretty good in this. I wonder what goes on inside his head.&&I skipped to the middle just to get a feel for it. First thing I hear, after Mark takes a hit, ""Hi Mark finally makes sense.""

Sold!&&Definitely. And I don't really blame them for that. But, I think they're somehow trying to recapture the same essence that lead to the popularity of The Room, and TRYING to do that will likely have the exact opposite effect. What makes The Room fun is those involved, in the beginning at least, weren't aware of how bad it is. It won't be the same if they are trying to make a bad movie instead of making a bad movie that they thought would be good. &&Seth Rogen went on the Nerdist podcast and Jonah brought up that he knew people who had seen Best (F)riends and they were shocked when it was actually pretty good. I'm excited to see what Tommy and Greg bring to the table.&&It's pretty clear that Wiseau has zero self awareness. I'm still not convinced he understands why The Room is popular. I honestly think he believes he made a great (in the traditional sense) movie. &&Well if you read Sestero's book, you would find that this is absolutely correct. It was a completely serious production for Wiseau. He wanted to submit it to the Oscars.&&To witty imply that they are both friends AND fiends.&&friends/fiends

I'm guessing it's like an odd couple type thing. &&Stolen from Werner Herzog's My Best Fiend in a pretty crazy doc about Klaus Kinski.&&They just finished watching Evangelion and were like yeah let's do that.&&And maybe their will be a Jacobs Ladder situation for real&&...and then he'll be able to go on ""I Was There Too"" with Gourley. &&His How Did This Get Made podcasts with Mantzoukas, his wife and their guests give me endless joy &&Ascheerio Paul&&Stephen Rannazzisi did a pretty good job improv-ing that 9/11 story&&That hummus scene was improv? Damn that was good

&&I've met him - he's nice- that felt important to share&&What's the difference between Portuguese food and Brazilian food? 'The cassava!' &&great comment but have you tried this hummus?&&*""don't worry about it""*&&uh-ha-ha-ha&&Have you seen the interviews? I don’t think he completely left - I’m pretty sure he’s part Tommy now.&&Another¿ movie!&&omfg what&&I'm pretty sure that's just industry talk for allowing him and his story to be portrayed in a movie&&So did Sestero purposefully write it badly?&&Is it laughably bad?&&I'm never sure how to tell people how terrible Neighbors was, since it's always brought up in context to The Room, which is celebrated *because* it's terrible. 

There's nothing redeeming about Neighbors and it's best to be avoided. I feel like Best F(r)iends will probably be the same.
&&I thought it was Billy from Stranger Things 2.&&I saw it at one of these pre-release showings too, and it unfortunately isn’t. If you go in expecting The Room 2 you’ll be disappointed. It definitely pays homage to it in a few places, but it’s just not the same. If Tommy wasn’t in it there would be little reason to give it a second glance. It’s not a good movie, but not ‘so bad it’s good’ either &&No, no it isn't. The camera work is bad. Not always, but when it's bad, it's bad. One of The Room's heckles during a live viewing is to yell ""FOCUS"" when it slips out of focus, and ""UNFOCUS"" when it actually goes back into focus.

They shifted crews several times over The Room's creation, and the last person to hold the camera was an amateur, pretty fresh out of film school if memory serves. It shows.

&&Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest they intended it to be ""so-bad-it's-funny,"" what I was suggesting was that in light of the public reaction since then, that in this movie they would push hard for a ""so-bad-it's-funny"" shtick.&&It’s bullshit.&&and????????&&Coen brothers kinda have a dark comedy thriller to a lot of films. Not thrillers exactly, but O Brother Where Art Thou and Burn After Reading aren't exactly dramedies either.&&In Bruges as well. It's a legitimate genre&&I thought Get Out was supposed to be a horror movie with comedic undertones.  Not a thriller.&&I watched Get Out as a Horror thriller, that had comedy moments to relieve tension here and there.

Juxtaposition I think is the term.  You can't have 1 theme nonstop for a long period of time, because it makes that 1 theme have less impact as time goes on.  Gotta break it up now and then to change emotion in the viewer, so they can start over when the theme returns.&&That's an art-house dramedy.&&Definitely fun for the fans of The Room. Not a great film in its own right though &&Hahaha what a story&&The the crappy mobile game&&It was an interview recorded by phone of James, Dave, and Seth. It was about 45 minutes long, and really fun. &&Pretty sure he’s just capitalizing on/promoting disaster artist, but him and tommy show up to showings once in a while. &&That guy that did the script reading as Johnny killed it&&Plot twist, I don't have friends 😩&&I am 57% sure that Tommy himself is at least 100&&Maybe it was supposed to be some twist in the movie that he just gave away. &&Ha ha, what a story Mark. &&🚨🚨🚨🚨GIMMIE A FUCKIN MIC🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨&&Do you understand life? Do you? &&James Franco loves you too, as a person.&&Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!&&Hahaha! What a stork Mark.&&I still can't believe he humped that dress&&Yeah, I honestly think that to some extent Tommy wants to just be like Johnny and have a lot of friends. &&The fact that Greg has lived so long with Tommy that he can do his strange accent just emphasises how close the two are...very unusual friendship they have. &&The audience gasped because they were thinking about poor Greg potentially being put in such a compromising situation. I don't think most people were taken out of the scene by that line and thinking about the incestuous aspect of the actors behind the characters doing something like that.&&I always heard it as you want pot roast&&I'll probably only hear this from now on&&I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL&&Baby face is more of a way of calling someone attractive, it's sort of like Tommy's pet name for him because he's got that model look.&&I thought he was a banker...which is even crazier&&>”All-American Hero”

FTFY&&He works in the computer business&&Wasn't he also a vampire? Or was a vampire in an early version.&&They actually never come out and say what his job is, only that he has a client at a bank and he can't tell Mark about it. Greg Sestero's theory is that he was a private eye&&God I hope he's a vampire this time &&He could have done Grima Wormtongue instead of Brad Dorff.  Wouldn't even need makeup.&&Jesus, Frank? &&> Fill me up with cream, **turn me into a canoli**, make a stew out of my ass

People seem to always forget the funniest line&&My mouth is, so dry.&&Hatched. I think the word you were looking for is, “hatched.”&&Well you know what they say ""you can't choose your parents, or your mortician""&&I picture all morticians looking like Paul Bearer. The Undertakers manager. No. I will not say it.&&I’d rather have Morgan Freemans comforting voice during such times&&Agree that's it better than the emoji movie,  just wasn't for me, most people in the cinema seemed to love it though. &&Growing up in the 90s, there was once a show that was billed as ""better than Walker Texas Ranger"" It became my family's go-to insult for almost a decade. &&Not many, suprisingly. There's something like three or four squashed almost immediately together, and then pretty much none after that if I remember right.&&You missed the whole cancer subplot!&&It really helps to watch it with a group, if you're watching by yourself the first time it's a bit painful. Having some people around while watching gives you a sounding board for all the ""wait, what?!?"" moments that are in the movie. And, there are a lot ""wait, what?!?"" moments in The Room.

It's not so much that The Room is a bad movie, it is bad. It's that Tommy Wiseau is not normal, and I can almost guarantee that you've never met someone who is the same abnormal as Tommy Wiseau. It helps if you have someone you can puzzle it out with while you're watching it. &&Any expectations you may have about cinema don't apply to that movie. No conventions are followed. In a normal movie, where the filmmaker thought about things like pacing, you'd expect to see more of those sex scenes sprinkled throughout the film after seeing so many in the first 30 minutes. But that's not this movie. Every scene of it could be in a completely different film, and essentially nothing that has happened prior to that scene has much impact on what's happening on-screen at any given moment. It's basically like they rolled one dice with characters on it and another with emotions on it prior to filming each scene and then just let the cameras roll.&&Greg Sestros gave negative fucks.&&Maybe they'll try to make a so bad is good like the Room, but all of their misguided attempts to make it bad will actually making it into an Oscar Winning masterpiece. &&IIRC, Tommy did an online show thing that flopped because it was trying too hard to recapture what The Room accidentally captured. Hopefully he learned from that.

Greg's a sharp enough guy that I think he'd know they couldn't just try to pull off The Room 2.

This absolutely could misfire, but I could see it working if Tommy just lets himself be the oddball he is and the rest of the movie just rolls with it.&&[deleted]&&That's why I didn't care for stuff like Sharknado. It's one thing if filmmakers unintentionally play out of their financial or artistic league – that can sometimes lead to really intriguing (if awful) results. Purposefully making a ""so bad it's cult"" movie just feels like a cheap cash grab to me, though.&&PLOT TWIST:  They purposely try to make it bad and it ends up becoming an Oscar sweeping masterpiece!&&I think this movie will take itself a bit too seriously.&&Tommy trying to relabel The Room as a dark comedy is evidence that he doesn't understand what makes The Room so popular, because nobody else thinks it is a comedy. We love it exactly because it is a horribly misguided and unintentionally hilarious relationship drama. &&Which is why I have hope ""Best F(r)iends"" can be so-bad-it's-good as well. 

He may truly believe he's making an oscar-level film.&&Having heard him speak many times, I think he's aware that his movie is legendary trash and we watch it because it's legendarily trash. He's a crazy person, but he's not braindead. He definitely set out to be the next Tennessee Williams, though.&&If I'm not mistaken this is mostly Greg Sestero's movie and Tommy Wiseau is just an actor in it&&He paid to keep it in theaters for two weeks just so it could qualify.&&[what an original concept for a film title](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200849/)&&Next. Level. Bonkers.&&What. Is. Happening?&&Put her in a bra!&&What is it's mission?&&Hes already been on it for Meet Dave&&Same, except for his ad copy. The dude always tries to spice up ads by sprinkling in improv and it always comes off as playing for time. Otherwise a great comic, just always feels like someone ran in and said ""make this Squarespace ad interesting"" with no warning.&&the hot sexual wordplay between Paul and June is sometimes overwhelming &&Just listened to his WTF podcast this morning. Dude had a fucked up childhood!&&""And one of the ways I wanted to help, is by making this delicious hummus..""

Yea a lot of dialogue in the show was improvised, that's why the cast is largely stand up and sketch comics. I remember reading about it in AV Club that the Hummus thing specifically was improvised.&&I’m obviously not sure of the details, but in an interview for the TIFF premier of Disaster Artist, Franco started a sentence with “Well when Tommy signed over his life rights to me....”&&He said he wrote it in four days.
&&Replied to a comment a bit further down but if I'm gonna have to be honest, it was bad. Not comically bad like The room (I love that movie with all of my heart)


Best F(r)iends just felt like recreating a miracle which wasn't possible, so felt like an awkward mess where they were constantly TRYING to make it whacky and weird like the Room. But by doing so it was a bit too try hard, sure watching it in cinema is a unique experience, but I feel like it definitely won't become The room 2.0. 

Think of it like Sharknado, where they're trying to make a weird movie, instead of a good movie which turned out bad and hilarious&&I have no doubt that it won't be good.&&You'll enjoy yourself.&&Same!&&I never said it was great, I just said it was watchable lol. &&Agree with the other commenter. I love The Room, it's so bad it's good, but this I found just plain bad. It felt very forced and it's not something I could recommend. On the other hand lots of other people in th screening seemed to enjoy it. &&Not the guy you were replying to, but if I'm gonna have to be honest, it was bad. Not comically bad like The room (I love that movie with all of my heart)

I just watched it in a cinema with 700 people in attendance and it was one of the most entertaining experiences I have ever had at the movies. Mostly because of the extreme roudyness of 700 people throwing plastic spoons everywhere and yelling stuff constantly whenever stuff happens. Its literally the only way to watch the movie.&&This is exactly how I feel about the Neil Breen movies. &&It's dangerous to watch alone.&&Seriously, what will happen to the world if both of them just deliver stunning, subtle performances to match a heartfelt, yet hilarious script?

Sounds like the plot to the producers.&&If they can or cant they dont care.

That was a TV show that he had been wanting to make for a long time. It's nothing more than a weird show cause Tommy is weird. &&Hmm, I think Tommy needs a ""straight man"" foil to his wackiness.  Greg seemed to be aiming for legit performance in The Room and it wouldn't have been the same if he was hamming it up as well.

Now he clearly knows what's going on but he could probably just phone in a ""serious"" performance and we'd all be so blinded by the glare of TW's insanity you wouldn't even see.&&The Neighbors. The original trailer had that Wiseau charm that makes the room great, but it was made years before the series was released, so it got revamped and tainted by self awareness.&&He didn't write or direct this though.&&Eh, Sharknado wasn’t so much intentionally bad as it was a stupid B-Movie that everyone knew was going to suck so they had as much fun with it as possible. It caught on because it actually did end up being fun. The Room is a completely different animal and idk if this is gonna work, but I hope it does.&&I recommend Neil Breen for good bad films if you haven't heard of him yet. He self-funds vanity projects and they are a great balance of weird and lacking in self-awareness.&&I personally hope that tommy *thinks* he learned from The Room and will try to use that lesson to make this movie good but it will backfire in a new and refreshingly hilarious way. ""They laugh at me when I ask about his sex life.""


Peculiar Mortician Played By Tommy Wiseau: So hows your emotional wellbeing??&&He didn't write or direct it.&&Tommy has made a TV show and nominated one of the episodes for an Emmy.&&Well, you haven't seen it.

Saw it at the double feature as well and it didn’t actually feel like it was trying to copy The Room to me. If The Room is trying to be a drama, Best Friends was trying to be a psychologically horror film. It was bad in its own ways but it was still enjoyable in its weirdness.&&Perfect.&&At times, it literally isn't. The football scene, when some characters are out of frame but they are still tossing the ball around, that seen is very literally frustrating to watch. 

The sharp cuts during the sex scenes, holy shit.

The camera work is atrocious, what movies are you watching?&&That's true. Tommy Wiseao is also probably not making a Coenesque film.&&Normal people trying, and failing, with usually disastrous results, to dabble in a life of crime.&&I always understood drama to be an umbrella term under which is thriller. Like, a thriller is a drama with more...well, thrills. Either way, I agree with you, but I think you could argue that there are enough thrills in that movie to qualify.&&> He also seems to fully embrace and enjoy the cult behind the movie

I saw it with a close friend of mine (a devout Catholic who didn't really care for raunchy movies) in college, and I had to swear to her that it wasn't all going to be sex scenes. She didn't believe me until halfway through. Loves the movie. :)&&Is it cut from more of the same footage?&&I remember reading somewhere the lead actress refused to do more sex scenes with Tommy Wiseau. Are they with her and Mark?&&Well.... that was the entire cancer subplot.&&I've been eyeing his stuff recently, so thanks, that's good to know. I really doubt I can talk my wife into it.&&[Take this](http://www.imgur.com/wAGRK_d.jpg)&&I mean it is 2017, my assessment of what's possible has been thoroughly shattered.&&I saw The Disaster Artist and I think they did a good job of showing that Greg is an untalented dolt, but he legitimately cares about Tommy, no matter how much Tommy manipulates him. They're kind of a perfect pair. They share similar weaknesses (being not smart or talented), but different strengths. They're an oddly perfect match.&&The entire time I was reading The Disaster Artist I kept thinking to myself why somebody would deal with Tommy's shit for as long as Greg had been&&How so? His book doesn't come off like it was written by an idiot.&&Lol, what? I've seen plenty of interviews with the guy and he seems totally normal and intelligent, if a bit introverted. You're describing him as if he's a knuckledragger.&&How do you mean?&&I have met him and the main thing I took away from it was not that he was an idiot but he was incredibly patient &&Why would you say that? &&Story time? &&I would guess they're talking about ""The Neighbors""&&ALIIIIEN PLEEEASE NOOOO&&Yeah, Greg wrote it, which actually makes it more interesting to me. Although I guess it's a two-parter now? That makes me a lot more skeptical that it can be good.&&Yeah but they made like 6 more sharknados.&&Tommy is just acting in this. It's Sestero's film through and through. &&Yeah. That's the problem and that's the reason why it won't be like *The Room*. It isn't directed by Tommy Wiseau, produced by Tommy Wiseau, written by Tommy Wiseau and starring Tommy Wiseau. &&I hope he wins&&It'd be like when Shatner won Emmys for The Practice/Boston Legal after decades of his name being a punchline regarding bad acting. &&What's up jerks&&Out of the dozen podcasts I listen to, his ad-reads are the only ones I skip.&&Aukerman's ad readings are top notch. Scheer is good sometimes but normally not great. &&His stepdad was extremely abusive to both him and his mother. Locking him in barns, throwing pitchforks at him or some shit and just beating the shit outta him. His mom created fake mail saying he won a hunting trip, with tickets and all, just so they could gtfo. &&And there's a sequel to Best F(r)iends, so he really wrote two movies in four days.&&Yeah, to be fair thriller is just drama with more suspense. You can't have one without the other, really.&&He'd be robbing cash exchange shops otherwise.&&By the way, I definitely have breast cancer &&Hello fellow American. This you should vote me. I leave power. Good. Thank you, thank you. If you vote me, I'm hot. What? Taxes, they'll be lower... son. &&>Hai doggy

FTFY&&You're my favorite customer &&> Hi doggy.

Oh SHIT what up Clark Kent&&I still don't know what's going on here.&&Wait, I thought Lisa worked in the computer business?&&Which is very competitive &&RUM HAM&&1998.&&Those sex scenes are exactly as erotic as watching sausage boil, because that's exactly what Tommy's hideous body looks like. A giant, half-boiled sausage.&&Frigging spoilers man. /s&&Annnnd scene. &&I enjoyed this exchange. It was almost too perfect, like planned out. Well done, guys.&&Soooo this *is* a romcom..&&That's what I like about them though. It's not the talent but the ambition and drive to do what they enjoy together as a team. They're the underdogs of Hollywood and I think everyone roots for them and want them to succeed that keeps them afloat. I know I'm going to watch this movie for that sake alone and hoping it'll be a hit. If not I know my money goes to someone who deserves it because they sure as hell put a lot of effort and soul into what they're doing.&&the guy was 20 or so and was doing what he could to break into show business.&&Yeah that makes sense from that angle. I guess if that's true than Tom Bissell probably wrote more of it than I thought. &&I thought the book did a great job of rationalizing it. He needed money, a place to stay, he needed tape, and he needed confidence. Tommy gave him all of those things at various points.&&Well one reason seemed to be that Tommy did that thing that abusers sometimes do where they heap generosity on you, insist that you take it (and that it's no big deal), then later insist that you owe them for everything they've given you. They set you up to feel indebted to them.&&The same reason people watch The Room. Pure, unbridled insanity is pretty captivating.&&I'm guessing he just genuinely likes him&&it was written with a ghost writer i'm pretty sure

e: it was written with tom bissell, a journalist, i would guess he did a lot of the heavy lifting.&&Neither does “The Art of the Deal”
&&He's got 200+ upvotes too. People just took his word for calling someone dumb. Smh&&Yeah. He seems very shy and nervous in most of his interviews whereas Tommy is less restrained. In *The Room* he seemed to be the only sane man - which made him my least favourite actor because he clearly knew exactly how bad the movie was going to be and every performance he gave just felt like he was rolling his eyes and waiting for it to be over. The other hired actors seemed to actually be trying and unaware of how bad the entire movie is; just following directions and doing their best with the incomplete terrible script. Greg is just a shy guy who feels somewhat embarrassed about *The Room* despite embracing its success. &&What a story Greg.&&Sestero is too normal and self aware to create a so-bad-it's-good movie. &&I hope some years after this one they both collaborate on a 3rd movie, but they make the same movie separately, and then a third party edits them together into one  film&&Jesus. Guess that's worth listening to the long version, thanks!&&You're tearing me apart LocusStandi&&Don't worry, you'll be fine. &&Haha what a story Mark!&&No Lisa was in the tearing him apart business. &&Oh you might be right I thought she was reacting to his business &&She can't support herself. For...reasons?&&hell in a cell&&A bromance, perhaps&&I wholeheartedly agree. These are two guys who, quite honestly, have no fucking business in Hollywood. What they did have was the passion, and inexplicably 6 million dollars, to make a movie. They made it and it was terrible. They could have easily faded into nothing and ended up a cautionary tale, but wrap your head around this, these dudes will be at the Oscars this year. They have a major motion picture based on their lives, a great one at that, and they have been immortalized. 

They never gave up on their dreams and it all came true for them. It's the most unlikely and improbable story in the history of film. They're folk heroes now. How could anyone not appreciate that? 

&&And then started to genuinely like Tommy on some level. &&Greg's Tommy impression in the audio book is worth whatever his cut is on its own.&&Either way the book is very thoughtful and introspective. Not something a dumb person can write, even with a ghost writer.&&I guess the "" but if you’ve ever met him"" part of his comment just indicated to people that this random guy on the internet should be trusted.

I mean, even if you haven't read the book, all it takes is a quick [youtube search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9XfZXfBe0o) to realize Greg has a good head on his shoulders.&&It makes no fucking sense. &&Don't tosh me, mudderfuckerrr. Geddout.&&Oh hai Mark.&&yeah you can say that again&&Meanwhile Mark was in the sex life business&&She doesn’t even want to talk about it. &&None of it matters. Which is also part of the fun. They might as well not have back story&&Through an announcers table&&ah deed naht heet you, it's bullshit, i deed naaaahhhhttt&&In a few minutes bitch.&&Hahaha, what a story Mark. &&And the owner of the flower shop is in the not-seeing-Johnny-there business.&&I am partial to the theory that he is an undercover cop.  It explains so much of his behavior.&&And Denny was in the eating an entire apple, core and all, business.

&&How dare she talk to him like that! She should tell him everything! Does she understand life? Does she?&&All we need to know is that Lisa is Johnny's future wife&&",2017-12-02 10:29:15
