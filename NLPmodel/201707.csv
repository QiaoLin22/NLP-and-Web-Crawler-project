"Joan Lee, Wife of Marvel Comics Legend Stan Lee, Dies at 93",73384,6lpg4d,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joan-lee-dead-wife-marvel-comics-legend-stan-lee-was-93-1018951,2564,1499380853.0,,"""When I was young, there was one girl I drew; one body and face and hair. It was my idea of what a girl should be. The perfect woman. And when I got out of the Army, somebody, a cousin of mine, knew a model, a hat model at a place called Laden Hats. He said, 'Stan, there's this really pretty girl named Betty. I think you’d like her. She might like you. Why don’t you go over and ask her to lunch.' Blah, blah, blah.

""So I went up to this place. Betty didn’t answer the door. But Joan answered, and she was the head model. I took one look at her — and she was the girl I had been drawing all my life. And then I heard the English accent. And I’m a nut for English accents! She said, 'May I help you?' And I took a look at her, and I think I said something crazy like, 'I love you.' I don’t remember exactly. But anyway, I took her to lunch. I never met Betty, the other girl. I think I proposed to [Joan] at lunch.”

- Stan Lee on meeting Joan&&Lived till 93 and was happily married for 70 years. That's one hell of a good life. &&Glad that they got to be in a movie together (X-Men Apocalypse) before she passed.

RIP Joan Lee.&&She was a great Madame Web.&&It's tragic, but she lived a long life, and honestly that's all we can ask for when we're put on this earth. May she RIP, and I really hope Stan Lee is doing well during this rough time for him. &&I was fortunate enough to meet them both about 15 years ago.

I used to be a master mechanic at Mercedes Benz of Beverly Hills.

Sometimes we did house calls for very special customers.

I roll up to this RIDICULOUS house in the Hollywood hills. The only info I had was a customer with the last name of ""Lee"". I'm assuming it's some wealthy Asian business man.

I buzz in through the front gate and roll up to the garage. An older white guy comes out of the house and hands me the keys to his car.

I'm puzzled for a second, because something in my brain clicks that I recognize this guy, and I can't quite pin it (This is before all of the Marvel movies really blew up with his cameos).

I look down at the keys and there is this really beautiful key ring. Solid gold with some fantastic detail work. It's a spider man head. It clicked.

My inner nerd squeed so hard you could hear it from space.

He says ""Hold on, I left something on the stove, I'll be right back"" and runs back in the house before I can say something.

I take a look at his car and do my thing. While I'm there, Joan comes out and asks me if I can take a look at what it will take to fix the mirror on her car.

From inside the house I hear Stan yell ""What the hell did that nutty bitch do that car this time?!"" I hear Joan yell back ""You shut up you stupid jackass! If you don't I'll tell him about the time you pulled the door off yours backing out of the garage!""

There was truly nothing but love and reverence in their bickering.

I'm happy that two such wonderful people were able to find happiness together for so long.&&I hope she is made immortal in comic form.&&""I wanted to give you the world, but it wasn't for sale. 
Don't know about perfume, well because I'm a male. 
Can't buy you jewelry, my picks would be a waste. 
I'm a dunce about clothes and you have plenty of those.
All I can do, and all I can give is my love. 
I adore you.""


One of Stan Lee'a poem to Joan. RIP&&Joan convinced Stan to write Fantastic Four when he was about to give up on comics.  Without her we wouldn't have most of the iconic superheroes we know today. RIP&&Getting to live 93 years, 69 of those by your spouse's side, isn't too shabby. Poor Stan Lee though. He probably feels like a part of himself died.&&I have Stan Lee's memoir [(It's a comic, of course. See here.)](https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Fantastic-Incredible-Marvelous-Memoir/dp/1501107720) 

I wanted to share a few bits of it about Joan. 

**Stan:** *To appreciate my reaction to seeing Joan^^for ^^the ^^first ^^time, you have to understand that I'd been drawing her for* **years!** *She was my* **dream** *girl, you see. I did countless drawings of her over the years -- and I'm not even an artist!*

---------------

*There I was in 1947 and I was a few days shy of my 25^th birthday. And what a birthday present I got. A friend set me up for a blind date with a model! I had no idea what to expect. That's kind of the point of blind dates, I guess. After three years at army camps, I couldn't wait to see her. She wasn't just a* **her,** *she was a* **vision!**

*She wasn't even the model I was suppose to meet!*

    Stan: Her name is Joan Bocock. British. From a place called Newcastle Upon Tyne. 
    I... fell in love with her the moment I saw her.
    
    (flashback to the past)
    Stan: I think I'm in love with you!
    Joan: Well, isn't that sweet.
    Stan: You want to go out? Right now?
    Joan: Wait.... are you the fellow who's supposed to be dating Betty?
    Stan: Who?

*I never actually met Betty. In a short time, Joanie and I were going steady. One of our favourite places to go was the beach. We loved the beach. Finally after a couple of dates, we just knew we were going to get married.*

*Here is the problem: Technically, Joanie was still married to someone else.*

-----------------------

Later

    Stan: Mum, Dad. This is Joanie.... My Wife.
    Mum: Welcome to the family ! I always wanted a daughter!
    Dad (to Stan): Good job son, she's gorgeous.

--------

Stan met Joanie in 1947 and he fell in love with her instantly. They had been married for 70 years, before Joanie died. I cannot fathom the hurt Stan may be feeling right now, but the fact he had 70 years with his dream girl has got to be amazing.
&&I went to a convention where Stan spoke. At 9pm sharp, the Q&A was stopped so Stan could call Joan and wish her goodnight. As a group we said goodnight. Will always be a good memory. &&Oooh boy... This is an ill omen, gentlemen. It's not uncommon for the surviving spouse to follow swiftly, especially at that age... :/

My condolences to the Lee family.&&I just saw him speak at UCLA last week. He had the energy and mental acuity of a man 50 years younger. I'm so sorry for his loss and I hope this tragedy doesn't break him.&&Damn. That really sucks, especially since elderly people who have been married a long time don't often hang around very long after spouse passes. Hopefully Stan will be around making cameos in Marvel films for years to come, but I'm sure this is devastating. RIP to the wife of a true legend.&&Former employee of Stan Lee Media here, who had occasion to visit Stan and Joanie's house several times.

She was an absolutely wonderful woman, a great hostess, one of the most charming and vivacious people I've ever met. She was lovely, and even though 93 years is a long time, I would have let her have a few years of my own if she wanted them. This really sucks, and I feel crushed for Stan.&&""When I was young, there was one girl I drew; one body and face and hair. It was my idea of what a girl should be. The perfect woman. And when I got out of the Army, somebody, a cousin of mine, knew a model, a hat model at a place called Laden Hats. He said, 'Stan, there's this really pretty girl named Betty.

""So I went up to this place. Betty didn't answer the door. But Joan answered, and she was the head model. I took one look at her - and she was the girl I had been drawing all my life.

-Stan Lee about Joan Lee 

Damn that's beautiful.
&&Ahh that sucks. &&They were so cute together. This simply sucks. &&Start preparing yourself psychologically folks.  Long time married couples tend to follow each other into the grave fairly quickly.  The shock of such a major change can be devastating to one's health, and there's a very significant chance that Stan will have a major health crises in the next few months.&&[deleted]&&I just saw ""lee,"" ""dies,"" and a picture of Stan Lee and my heart sank. 

I do feel sorry for Mr. Lee in regards to the loss of his wife; I'm sure they were married for many happy years. &&Rest in Peace, Mrs. Lee.

I know Stan may be shortly behind you, but I know however long it takes will be the most miserable, painful period of his life. 

How can one live, having found their other half and held on dearly for seventy years, and then lose her?

I don't wish that pain on anyone. I certainly don't wish it on the man who helped to make my childhood what it was. 

My condolences to the entire family.&&Shit, Stan shouldn't be far behind. Just like Johnny Cash when he lost June Carter. 
They kinda die of a broken heart... 

Ugh&&Horrible news but atleast she lived a long and fullfilling life. rip madame web&&We lost Madame Web the day before Spiderman comes out. &&Sad news, I hope Stan can make it through this.&&So sad for him. Such a beautiful love story. &&:( 

Condolences to Stan Lee and his family. 

Fuck, I wish I knew a better way to express this. ^ sounds so much like a perfunctory platitude. But sincerely, no bullshit, my thoughts are with Stan Lee and his family. 

He's such an awesome man and public figure - and I know most of us (myself included) have never met Stan Lee or his wife, but I imagine he's had a pretty big impact on most of us. It hurts to think that he's in so much pain. 

Edit: grammar   &&He spoke at my Uni a couple years ago. During the Q&A, he was asked ""Who is your favorite superhero?"" 

His response ""Well gee I would have to make  new superhero out of my wife. She is my favorite superhero"". 

Rip Joan. &&Aww, feeling sad for him. Condolences to his family&&Hate to be that guy, but once your wife dies at that age you aren't going to be very far behind. It's not like losing half of yourself, you actually lose half of yourself. God bless Joan and Stan.&&Even when people live such a long life and have such a fulfilling one, it's still depressing.  Especially for the surviving spouse.  Feels bad.&&Poor Stan. Heart goes out to you big fella. &&93. That's a full life. Can't ask for more than that. &&Please. Whatever you do 2017. DON'T TAKE STAN LEE&&I was at ComicCon in Portland last September. When asked about how his marriage was so strong, Stan's only advice was to ""marry a woman like Joan.""

Keep strong, sir. We're all behind you.&&Oh no...rest in peace :(&&Tragic, but comforting to know they had such a long, loving relationship.

My thoughts are with Stan and his family.&&My heart really breaks with this news. I once saw how Stan Lee reacted when his wife had a fall. He just apologized to his fans and said ""my wife needs me"" and left. It was just so clear how much he loved her. 

&&She didn't die the One above all has called her home.&&Kind of messed up that whenever we see things like this we take the selfish thought of, ""That sucks because it might lead to me missing out on XYZ entertainment."" I know I did that when Ledger passed away. 

Best to think of this for what it is; a sad occurrence for a beloved entertainer.&&How does a spouse go on after losing the love of their life of 70 years?&&They better film Stan's cameos in advance for the next couple marvel movies...&&STAN WE LOVE YOU. Don't leave us please. 
&&Let's stop saying ""and Stan will be next""! Let's stay close to him and Joan with our thoughts and positive energy. Stan, we love you!&&This made my heart hurt. It's always sad imagining life after a significant other passes away.&&I don't think Stan Lee is going to take this well, I hope the ensuing depression doesn't take him too.&&Omg may she Rest In Peace and hope the best for Stan Lee hope he and their family feel beer for the loss they had R.I.P Joan Lee 1922-2017 long years and a strong marriage ❤️&&Not to be morbid as fuck but when a spouse dies like half of the time the other dies right after &&My dad's parents died within 24 hours of each other. We had to have a double funeral. &&Behind every great man is a great woman. I hope that she rests easy and that Stan reflects on this loss knowing even though his wife is gone the love they shared will live on forever. &&the only reason i upvoted this is because i want to show my deepest condolences much love to Stan and bringing me much happiness throughout my life. &&This man was a goddamn hero to me before I even knew who he was. Fuck I hope he makes it through this, I can't imagine life without your spouse after so many years. &&why do i get the feeling Stan Lee won't be far behind her :(&&I feel terrible.... Because I saw this and went 

""Wait Stan Lee died?!""
""Oh phew it was his wife.""
""Wait.....I hate myself.""&&Poor stan. &&READ AS STAN LEE DIES, but this is still a sad thing. I hope he's okay &&if my wife died after being married for 70 years I'd have one foot right behind her...regardless of anything I had accomplished in my life, that marriage was obviously #1 to them.

RIP Joan, and Stan....I wish you happiness, however that may come to you.&&69 years is a long time to be married and stay in love.
Condolences Stan!&&She lived a long and an accomplished life, and that deserves so much respect. She supported her husband through a lot for up to 70 years.&&Yeah, I mean... I can't see this as tragic. She's lived a full life and was bound to die of old age sooner or later. She's lived longer than most people.&&You know, this is beautiful. They seemed to have an amazingly great life. Not many can boast a marriage of that long. What a sweet lady &&There's a pretty good documentary called ""With Great Power: The Stan Lee Story"" that features Stan Lee and his wife sharing stories about their life together.&&I can't imagine loosing your soulmate after 69 years. Damn shame.&&Sad to say..I couldn't handle that.. totally possible he goes also pretty quick&&Aw shit. I'm getting worried now. My heart goes out to him and his family. I just hope he will still be able to see the Avengers wrap up.&&F&&DC give their condolences! because that's what it's about people...not some stupid fanboy war! May she rest in peace!

https://twitter.com/DCComics/status/883118278293544960&&That's sad, I'm literally watching the end credits to homecoming right now and scrolling through Reddit while I wait for the final final end credit scene and I see this. Hopefully Stan can keep going forward even with this tragic loss right on the release of Spider-Man &&I wonder if her and Stan ever had sex dressed up like super heroes.&&That means Stan isn't too far behind. Tough to hear I know, but what's a man without his woman. Broken hearted ....&&Elderly men usually pass soon after their wife passes....sigh....brace yourselves guys.&&i'm sure she was never once disappointed in her dumb nerd book drawing husband&&Man I feel really bad for stan lee&&For a second I saw ***Stan*** Lee. I had a mini heart attack. Still very sad though...&&""Wait come back , I have so many more stories to tell "" 

Did anyone else think this scene was a little dark?  To me it was like Stan Lee knows his time is limited and he's not ready to go.&&F&&Brace yourselves &&RIP Joan and Lee. Usualy long term couples(50+ years) die within a month from each other.&&Everyone prepare themselves..the time for stan lee too go to the next life ia approaching &&That is a terrific story. Lucky Stan. Poor guy.&&It was a truly special relationship. And that's why I'm worried for Stan. This is gonna be devastating for him, and at his age, I don't know if he can handle it.&&Read that in his voice despite only hearing him speak in his throwaway Marvel roles. Great story, and seems very him. Condolences to the man. &&Classic Schmoslee&&Whenever I propose at lunch my boss tells me to eat in my cubicle for the rest of the week and the HR lady says she isn't angry, just disappointed. &&[You will all refer to me by the name Betty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz1rjq5emKY)&&> She was the girl I had been drawing all my life

That is an incredibly romantic sentence... wow.&&Upon reading this, I suddenly realise the inspiration for Mary Jane Watson. There are a lot of parallels between this and her first appearance. Hope he gets through this.&&Oh man&&I feel so sad for Stan. I too believe in heartbreak syndrome, but let's not hope that on Stan... Their relationship/personality (healthiness and liveliness) reminds me of my grandparents. My grandparents were both very healthy, lively, and loved each other so much that they would do anything for one another. My grandpa was 80 when my grandma passed away at 69. After her passing my grandpa became lost and started writing in his journal every single day about his past, their love for each other and their journey through life. It was true love. I've never seen my grandpa so quiet and reserved before this. Unfortunately, my grandpa passed shortly after my grandma. They're in a better place now, together and happy.&&""Going straight into the hard-hitting line, 'I love you.' It’s a bold strategy Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off for him.""

70-year long marriage. It paid off alright.

&&Classic Schmosbey.&&>  And I took a look at her, and I think I said something crazy like, 'I love you.' I don’t remember exactly.

Whoa, Stan pulled a Mosby.&&What a lucky guy. If I told a blind date that I drew superhero comics for a living, she'd get the emergency phone call from a friend. &&I used to draw my ideal girl all the time when I was like 10 years old. Big tits and legs. I just don't know who my dream girl is because so many women match that description...&&Face it, tiger...&&Can you imagine having your SO die after 70 years of marriage? Waking up every day seeing her for 70 years. Celebrating everything marvel has accomplished through out those years.&&And now Stan Lee will be dead within a month.&&I would have waited a bit longer than 70 years to marry him, I'd like to see see if this funny book thing actually pays off or not first.&&I wish we could do like a post-life interview. Like a life debriefing.&&This is my dream life. Just having a stable long lasting marriage and seeing each other to their end. &&That's something that's such a wonderful realization. To have someone to share your love and life with until you're old and gray. Rest In Peace, Mrs. Lee, and my heart goes out to Mr. Lee.&&Beautiful couple, too. I never stopped to notice before, but she was quite a lovely lady.

RIP Joan, hopefully you can handle a short break without Stan; we're not ready to let go of him quite yet.&&Saw it yesterday and thought, huh, what else is she in?&&Who was she in that movie? &&Holy crap, I just looked it up. She was madame web in the 90s Spider-Man cartoon?

I though she was so *cool* when I was a kid and I had no idea. &&One of my all-time favorite animated characters with a voice I could never imagine to be different.

She was *fantastic* as Madame Web and it hurts to know she didn't get a chance to play her in live action in some way.&&i had no idea. those episodes I remember even 20 years later. great character and the perfect voice. RIP.&&I think she also appeared with Stan in X-Men Apocalypse as the missles were all ejected.  Come to think of it I think that may have been her first on screen appearance. I'm not sure.&&Exactly. This is sad, of course, but how many people get to live into their 90s with their partner? It's ultimately a lovely thing.&&70 years of marriage!&&[deleted]&&I hope Stan doesn't go cause of a broken heart.. :(&&It's the opposite of tragic for exactly that reason.  A long fruitful life with a loving spouse with whom to spend most of it is a happy tale with a bittersweet but satisfying ending.

Excelsior, Mrs. Lee!&&Thanks for posting this. Great story. &&And then?.... I need more man.&&This is lovely. We should all be so lucky. &&That bickering sounds like the way my grandparents talk to each other. I can only hope to have a relationship as long and fulfilling as theirs. 

That's so awesome you met them, great story. He is truly a legend and I hope he doesn't die soon after this like many people who lose their partner after so long. &&Apparently she's immortal in movie form, she made a cameo with Stan in x men apocalypse&&I mean she's basically the first lady of superheroes. RIP Mrs. Marvel.&&Nope, Jack Kirby conceived of the Fantastic Four pretty much singlehandedly. Lee's duties would've been limited to plotting individual stories (which Kirby ended up doing the brunt of anyways) and dialogue. &&Just a reminder to follow your dreams with passion and hugs your loved ones.&&It's something everyone strives for, but rarely finds.  It's really the most beautiful love story ever imagined.&&Holy shit. She's from Newcastle? That's like an hour away from me, I'd never have guessed.&&Sounds like something out of a romantic sitcom! Very, *very* rarely do couples get to have those movie-like romance fairy tales. Glad Joan and Stan were one of the few.&&Face it Tiger, he hit the jackpot. &&MegaCon? &&I'm not crying!  youre crying!&&My wife's grandparents were together for 65 years. Her grandfather's health started declining at 94. He had to go into the hospital, but we all thought it was just a matter of time, and felt sad for her grandma. Then her grandma (93) had to be hospitalized. She was put in the same room as her husband, then passed away within a few days of being admitted. While her grandma was in the hospital with him, grandpa's health started improving pretty dramatically. After she passed, he went two weeks later. 

I felt bad for my wife for losing both of her grandparents at the same time, but couldn't help but point out how beautiful of a story it was. I think any one of us would be lucky to go the same way. &&That was my first thought too. I'm not ready. That's so terrible, they'd been married since 1947 apparently. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose someone who you've been so close to for 70 years...&&[deleted]&&met Stan Lee last year at FanExpo canada, he announced it would be his last trip up to canada as he was getting too old to travel. I'm glad i got to meet him and take a photo with the guy. i'm very saddened for him, i saw the documentary about his life a couple of times and the love he and his wife shared was exemplary, and i strive to have that kind of relationship with my wife. I wish him all the best, but i kind of agree with you. as much as we'd love to have Stan for another 93 years, I'm grateful for his entire legacy, and his contribution to the world. I hope he can find some comfort in knowing we're all mourning with him.&&You never know. My grandpa died in his early 90s about 5 years ago. (shit, time flies). I thought grandma was gonna go, but she's still well, alive and kicking. Stopped dyeing her hair though. &&thought that too. &&Yeah, my maternal grandma died in 1993, and my maternal grandpa almost died a month later from grief.  Managed to introduce him to the local YMCA and he worked out four days a week until late 2012.  His last time at the gym was two weeks before he died, lived to the ripe old age of 95.  Incredible guy and I miss him greatly.

My paternal grandpa died in the early 2000s.  Paternal grandma died two months later.  Married almost 60 years.  Grandma wasn't even remotely ill nor did she have any issues except a hip replacement in the early 90s.

Have had many aunts and uncles die where the corresponding uncle or aunt dies within three months.  I can't imagine losing someone that I've been that close to for so long.  It blows my mind just trying to imagine it.&&Well if I know Stan Lee he knows how to cope with grief. Just look at batman.&&I thought the same thing.

He may want it that way though. The less time feeling separated from each other at that age the better. &&Exactly what I just said to my wife. We have both had family member in the 80s who's spouses passed and each of them passed within months of their partner passing.&&I thought the same thing when I read the title. :/

A lot of people just leave when they lose their partner.&&Well, it's not impossible to keep on surviving. I know my grandfather outlived my grandmother by almost 20 years. 

That said, Stan's pretty old himself. Everyone's time comes eventually. &&It's going to be Carrie Fischer and her mom all over again.&&Like Johnny and June Carter :(&&This is what I thought. His rock, his life blood just left...

I hope we are wrong and he stays strong, because she would want him to&&That was my first thought too unfortunately. Especially for the man to be the survivor after so many years of marriage. If he can make it 6 months, he should be ok, but that is a big if.&&He's prerecorded a few ahead of time at least so he'll still be around :(&&I've been hoping all his cameos are the same charector, as one of The Watchers. And he is gonna have a standalone film about him traveling all around the planet to watch super hero fights. &&Stan Lee is 94 years old. He was born to poor immigrant parents, and went on to be fabulously wealthy. He lived with the love of his life for 70 of those years. He was a guy that went from erasing pencil marks on comics in a dingy office to having 10,000 people chanting his name at Comic-Con. He created some of the most iconic comic characters of all time, and he lived long enough to see them become the most popular entertainment on the entire planet. 

When he does pass, I don't think we should be sad. He had about as good a century as you can have.   &&I was in the same boat. Not to downplay the tragedy of Joan's passing, but my heart stopped momentarily when I skimmed the headline and I thought we lost Stan Lee. &&Or Debbie Reynolds the day after Carrie fisher.&&After 70 years of marriage, I don't know if I would want to live without my other half anyways. Really hope Stan is doing okay. :(&&Ferretts can die of loneliness&&Johnny Cash's health was rapidly declining due to old age and disease, that's part of why Hurt's music video was filmed where it was, in the abandoned, deserted Johnny Cash Museum. He knew his death would approach soon, and his wife, too, for she was diagnosed with cancer. Part of why he took a license to sing it.


Or at least that's what I remember reading&&How cool would it have been for her to play her in the MCU? I mean she was really old, but still it would've been so awesome.&&Carry on, true believers.&&They've already filmed a few, if I remember correctly. I think 6-8 of his upcoming cameos are already done.&&You shut your mouth! 😩&&Married 69 years to the girl of his dreams.......we should all be so fortunate. I feel for him, but we all gotta go at some point, and he certainly is a very fortunate man. &&That's so amazing. Usually when I tell girls I love them straight away, they block me &&Locked that shit down quick&&Fine line between terrific and creepy.&&Heart break syndrome is real. The next few days/weeks/months will be so hard for him.&&What I'm worried about is misguided fans turning this into a Marvel thing rather than a Stan thing; I'm hoping we can keep this to genuine and respectful condolences and give the poor guy the mix of background support and personal space he'll need.&&He's 94, so realistically speaking the world will lose him in the next few  years regardless, unfortunately. Death blows, but we can't really avoid it. &&You gotta check him in his Simpsons appearances. 

Helluva voice in additon to the creative mind.&&Checkout ""With Great Power: The Stan Lee story"" it's an excellent documentary. &&He speaks just the same basically in person and not addressing superheroes of course. I met him about 2 months ago, still has that sharp wit and pep. I really feel for him right now, what a terrible loss.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJpAXf5wyk&feature=youtu.be&t=2m22s&&His cousin's all like ""Haaaave you met Betty?""&&Unexpected himym is especially unexpected.&&The gentleman!!!&&Because you didn't propose to the HR lady. &&And if you don't do what he says he'll cut off your big toe!

Oh, that smarts!&&Fuck yes! This world needs more Kung Pow!&&Piuuuuu wiiiiuuuuu wiiiiuuuu&&But! Isn't Betty a woman's name?&&It's honestly heartbreaking. I really hope Stan is able to make it through this. The man's a legend, it would be so sad if he passes after this. &&After such a long routine and then poof, it's gone. If it was me I would be what the hell am I gonna do with my life now? Literally a piece of you is gone. &&Marveling at their accomplishments you could say?&&My grandpa died this weekend and this is exactly what my grandma told me. She doesn't know how she's going to keep waking up in an empty bed from now on&&who the fuck cares what marvel has accomplished. Why couldn't you let this be a private  moment between husband and wife &&It's honestly going to be the hardest thing Stan will ever go through. I wouldn't even be shocked if he died soon from a broken heart.&&Honestly one of the first things I thought of. Poor Stan.&&[deleted]&&DONT YOU PUT THAT JUJU OUT IN THE WORLD, /u/PostHedge_Headhog&&Don't you fucking jinx it! &&You shut your whore damn mouth&&Maybe we do. &&She was Madame Web in Spider-Man The Animated Series&&She voiced [Madame Web](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wXdYP-RkCyk/VwnrX635mvI/AAAAAAAAwcg/J0Lsg6I29MMgXuZEWF0hGSvkmkRa2diZg/s1600/1870636-madame_web_super.png) in the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon.&&Heaven. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH21Zp7ZGJ8&&Yeah, its still my favorite Spider-Man cartoon to this day.&&Susanne Blakeslee did a great job as Web, too.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Sadly, [that is a thing](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/11/science-of-longtime-couples-who-die-together.html)&&I literally just texted this to my wife. He's had a long life, to be sure. I just hope that he doesn't go out like this. For a man who has brought such a measure of joy to so, so many people, I'd hate for him to pass with such sadness. 

Our thoughts are with The Man.&&He hasn't been shy about how much he adores her too. Hope he's holding up.&&It's a perfect ""old couple"" story.&&He fixed the car.&&She was also the voice of Madame Web in the 90's Spider-Man cartoon.&&Fuckin A man. I've always heard about, and personally witnessed, people who pass very shortly after their loved ones pass. Don't be surprised if the legend himself passes by the end of 2017.&&For those that don't know:

In the early days of Marvel comics, they used what they later called the ""Marvel Method"".

1. Stan Lee creates the plot, tells Jack Kirby

2. Jack Kirby draws the comics (often ignoring Lee's notes)

3. Stan Lee then wrote the word bubbles, narration, and footnotes on top of the art.

This meant the comics were basically plotted but unscripted until the art was finished, which gave the artist a greater deal of creative control. Unlike nowadays where comics are commonly scripted and planned out before the art is drawn. There are benefits and drawbacks to both methods.

There's a long standing controversy that Stan Lee gets all the credit for those early comics where more should go to Jack Kirby. That isn't meant to diminish Stan, he is absolutely responsible for Marvel being what it is today but not really in the way people like to think he was. Kirby was the guy doing most of the work, at least when it came to actually making the comics.      &&I'm just imagining this extreme Geordie accent now. &&[deleted]&&Honestly, that is probably the best way to go. If I can choose how I want to go, I will choose to live until a ripe old age with my spouse and then die shortly after she is gone.&&My grandparents were together for over 70 years. When my grandma passed I thought my grandpa would follow shortly. But he hung around another few years. Its crazy to assume someone in their 90s will be around for a long time. But we may have some more time to cherish them.&&I can imagine. I would die. Simple. &&Jesus Christ. My dad was born in '47. Their marriage outlasted _him_. :(&&Gotta say though, that's quite a long life. Born in the Great Depression, married shortly after WW2.&&I hope he's alright...  I've met him many times at various cons and he's such a great guy and a great story teller.  Do you know if he was planning on attending Comic Con in San Diego?  I just bought tickets to his LA Comic Con in September this morning.  I always make a point to catch him speaking because he's such a great guy.  I've heard him tell that Fantastic Four story and it's heartbreaking to hear that she has passed.&&Wait, he was joking when he told Brody that story about the contest with Jagger?  &&Can you maybe tell him that we are really sorry for his loss?&&Met him there as well last year, was an amazing experience and I'm glad to have met him. &&Yeah, one of my grandmothers died in her mid 80s nearly 9 years ago, and my grandfather on that side of my family is still going at 96.&&I've heard it said that it's if the wife dies, the husband may go quicker. But if the husband dies the wife may survive the loss better. My grandfather died more than 20 years ago but my grandmother is still alive at 95.&&Insightful? Or inciteful?

Either way. Good job. &&NEEEEERRRRD RAAAAAAAAAGE&&Dear lord.&&He's gonna don a costume and beat up criminals?&&It makes sense I think. I'm not a doctor so I don't know why, but heartbreak does have physiological effects. I had no appetite for a few days the last time I experienced it. If you're a nonagenarian, who knows what effect it might have on your body.&&I dunno, two old people dying together in their 90s is a fair amount less tragic than Carrie Fisher.&&Seriously, he's had quite an amazing life. Especially coming from that background (I didn't know), marrying the love of his life, being with her for 70 years, and having millions of people across the world enjoying his creations culminating in a 22 movie, 15 billion dollar cinematic universe. Truly inspirational&&I feel like a dick because I felt the same way haha, everything slowed down for a moment.&&That's what I thought until I watched the documentary 'Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds'

She's was not doing well at all well before &&>Married 69 years

Nice&&Stan Lee seriously has one fulfilling life. I have nothing but a solid mix of envy, respect, and wonderment for the man.  &&In the fifties they just didn't have the option&&My grandfather just buried my grandmother today. He is a tough man, always stoic, even today. But you could see it in his eyes- he isn't ok, and he might never be again until he too passes. I'm worried about him. 

Stan Lee is older than my grandfather and already close to the end of most human's life spans. I'm hoping he can get through this alright but who knows :( Truly heartbreaking &&I'm going to write a letter to him. I think a showing of support from us is in order, even if it's just an assistant telling him about them. &&Mall Rats was a good one too &&""The Hulk fits right in there! Look, he's fitting right now!""&&I say ""haaaaaave you met Ted?"" ALL. THE. TIME. and no one ever gets the reference. it hurts my heart a little every time. &&Stan*&&Does this mean that, now that Joan is gone, he's going to get with Betty?&&A story about saying ""I love you"" too early is about the only time that I do expect a himym reference. &&""What would you say your strengths as a wife are? Weaknesses?""&&...recently &&That's tender!&&Thats usually what happens with spouses married for so long. It like they lose the will to live, and the pass a shortly after :(&&Yea we're all thinking it but probably dont want to say: 

broken hearts can make living a lot harder. &&My Godfather didnt last long after his wife of 50 years died.&&I really hope we don't have a Johnny Cash situation happen... 

edit: He died shortly after June Carter. People said he died of a ""broken heart""&&My exact thoughts. I will go into mourning for a full year. Possibly longer.&&He may not though. Studies have shown longterm couples even end up with synchronized heartbeat rates and other crazy physiological changes over time when being with one specific person so long. not unnormal for them to die soon after or deteriorate faster after. &&[deleted]&&Well if he makes this next year he may get a little more mileage but this is the kind of thing that weakens and kills an individual&&He's just about done.&&> The man's a legend, it would be so sad if he passes after this.

I hate to break it to you but that's literally inevitable.&&I mean, he'll eventually pass after this. There really isn't any other option.&&Came here to express same fear. Ive seen many a great men die of heartache. &&I'd be surprised to see him make it another year tbh.&&Unlike the majority of older people who lose husbands/wives Stan has a very active life, he's been winding down over the years but he won't be dealing with this alone and I think that might help him get through this better than most.&&I think that was the worst part of losing my grandma. We were all at the hospital, and in 25 years I had never seen my grandpa cry. Watching him sob over her body while all he could say was what am I going to do now? was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.

He was so mad at her, because his plan was always that he go first. He went from the jokester, 74 year old that looked like he was 50 and had the stamina of a 40 year old to a feeble 90 year old man almost overnight. He gave up when he lost her.&&My grandfather passed away three years ago. He was married to my grandma for over 60 years. 

The day of the funeral my grandma was stoic and silent. She showed no emotion and greeted all the mourners with grace and appreciation. 

About a week later we took my grandma to Sunday mass and as we were walking out one of her oldest friends came over to say hello and asked how she was doing. My grandma said, ""It is harder than I could ever have imagined.""

It's the one and only time I've heard her speak of the loss, but it's been written on her face every day since then. &&Christ..

*sigh*

 Yeah, I would say.&&DC move dude. &&My grandpa is 87 years old and my grandma died about a year ago. There's hope&&I will be devastated when Stan passes away&&That was the first thing to come to my mind too. :(&&*Ooobaaa, ooobaaa*&&Unfortunately that kind of thing just happens :(&&Oh wow, that's really cool. Not just saying this because she died but she honestly did a great job with that character. Such a distinct voice and memorable part of the show. && When I read that, I remembered the final episode where he gets to go and meet Stan Lee and they both agree that he's a 'heck of a guy' or something like that. That's when the onions kicked in&&http://i.imgur.com/0mw1I8e.gif&&Dude&&Not sure if a really sweet sentiment or too soon. &&You're not wrong.....&&[boi ](https://i.imgur.com/XHBa71T.jpg)&&Good, these wikis need updated.

Kinda cute!&&This one and spectacular are the only ones I Liked. The newer ones seems to target a younger age demographic&&(if you can afford it of course)&&Probably not, given life expectancy isn't *that* much higher than it used to be.

We've gotten very good at preventing infant fatalities.  Removing all those zeroes from the average has caused the ""average life expectancy"" to skyrocket without actually prolonging people who love into adulthood for all that much longer.

Live expectancy will continue to increase with all medical steps foreward--but there's an user limit where human bodies just can't run anymore.  I see little evidence that life past 100 will be sustainable for the majority of people&&I highly doubt it. &&Not really, unfortunately. There's a some studies suggesting that while the average age is rising, the maximum age has been pretty constant. It's possible we're just not built to last much past 100.&&I'm really hoping they find a way to slow the aging process as well. Have you ever seen a 110 year old? Now imagine that is the halfway point of your life. Plug my bird bones and tissue paper skin into the matrix once my eyes, ears and bowels go. &&Doubtful. Humans will top out at around 90ish being the average for natural causes, but not in 100 years. Even given 100 years, the only thing that will be keeping humans alive far past that would be all medical science. Natural death will reach a plateau average of around 80-90.&&born too soon :(&&Lol, I think life will be closer to MadMax than Star Trek by then. &&[deleted]&&I think he knows it's a thing, that why he said he hopes he doesn't. &&4 months after June Carter Cash passed on, Johnny followed after her. 

A couple in love for so long, it's even more hurtful living without the other. If Stan passed, I hope there's an afterlife where Joan is waiting for him to spend Eternity together. He's done a lot for the comic world. He deserves peace.&&This is too true. As soon as I read the title I thought back to Carrie Fisher and her mother.&&Man, I hope Stan Lee doesn't ever browse reddit articles. I cannot imagine how weird reading comments like this about yourself would be. &&I feel this is the case with a lot of successful franchises or whatever. Usually there are more people to be credited than just one single person, take Star Wars for an example.&&So, Stan Lee is Steve Jobs ans Jack Kirby is Steve Wozniak &&I've always heard it that Stan Lee was more like Marvel's hype man.&&Correct me if I'm wrong, but, you're not saying Kirby deserves more credit than Stan, right? Saying that Kirby did most of the work seems wrong. I mean they both deserve credit, but Stan gave those characters stories and personalities, Kirby provided the art. Without Stan's perspective Marvel's heroes wouldn't be the same. &&Where were Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster while that was going on?&&""Joan, will you marry me?""

""Why aye, man!""&&That's so fucking sad and yet I want that connection more than anything else&&Kind of reminds me of this

On the bright side, as a parent, I can say that while having a grandchild is 'a goal', I suppose.  I would be far happier seeing my child exhibit all of the good behavior I've instilled in them and grow to be someone happy in their own skin.  Even though my daughter is only three, I know one day she'll be a spitting image of me, make some man (or woman) very lucky, and have children of her own (when she's ready).  If I'm not here to see that, I'll still die knowing that fact and proud as always of her.

Him chasing me in Black Ops zombies always got the blood pumping&&This is a big one, he was the person that got zombies into popcultre. True legend for sure! &&Fun fact about the great George A. Romero, he appeared uncredited in The Silence of the Lambs as an FBI Detective in Memphis.  Man on the left [here.](http://i.imgur.com/HrGMgf7.png)&&But are you sure he is dead?  Only one way to make sure.......&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I'm happy to hear he died peacefully in his sleep, in the company of his loving family while listening to his favorite music.

He made some great films, and I'm really hoping Matt Birman turns Road of the Dead into something great that would make Romero proud&&Dawn of the Dead is not only one of the best sequels ever, it's a damn masterpiece. Too bad some people will only know him for his later Dead movies. His first three are must watch films for horror fans. Tons of people may not know of the man but he's responsible for a lot of pop culture. Rest In Peace George. &&Shit, that sucks. Rest in peace big guy, and thank you for everything.&&My mouth dropped when I saw this. I can't explain the effect his movies have had on my life. My earliest memory of watching a movie is Dawn of the Dead, since we live a few miles from Monroeville Mall. My uncle was the fat zombie who falls into the water fountain. Then I remember seeing Night of the Living Dead on late night cable and absolutely loving it. Then renting Day of the Dead and setting up two VCRs to dub a copy. Throughout my life I have bought Dawn of the Dead two times on VHS and twice on DVD including the big box set. I even have a tattoo of Bub. 
George is a legend around Pittsburgh. I've always enjoyed watching documentaries featuring him and thought he was the nicest guy. 
He will be missed......big, bloody bucket of win for him.

And not just the Dead movies....Creepshow is one of my favorite flicks. Monkeyshines, Martin, Knightriders, all great. 

Thanks to Romero's relationship with Dario Argento, which brought the band Goblin into the Dawn of the Dead soundtrack, they have become one of my favorite acts ever. I was fortunate enough to see Claudio Simonetti's Goblin last year and it was one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. &&As influential as Lucas and Spielberg. RIP&&Lung Cancer. Shit. This man got me interested in classic horror in my early 20s... At least he went in his sleep. RIP.&&A lot of people are only familiar with his zombie movies (as deserved, that original trilogy is goddamn legendary), but my favorite Romero has always been Martin. Not only his ultimate masterpiece, I think it's the greatest vampire movie ever made and one of the best movies of the 70's. 

If you have never seen it do yourself a favor and check it out. Unfortunately the dvd is out of print and there is no blu ray because the guy who owns the rights to it (same person who owns Dawn of the Dead) is a fucking ass who won't let anyone license it.

RIP to the GOAT.&&Watched Dawn of the Dead everytime I had a couple days off it's the best zombie movie created. 


Rest in peace George &&George Romero almost single handily kickstarted and entire genre/subculture; there aren't many directors who can claim that kind of accomplishment.  And it's even more impressive how his movies *still * feel relevant today; the ending of *Night of the Living Dead* still hits you like a truck.

RIP&&Many make genre films.

Few create entire genres. &&The man created the rules for what is now a classic movie monster. 

What an incredible legacy he leaves behind. 

Thank you, Mr. Romero. &&Night of the Living Dead is the best horror film of all time. Romero was a horror legend and I'm beyond sad that he's gone. RIP.&&Bub sad.&&I stood in line  for like 4 hours to meet him and get his autograph at a horror convention in Cherry Hill, NJ.  I'm really not all that into the collectibles and whatnot so I had nothing for him to sign.  I bought a NotLD poster at the convention which I though was pretty cool, and I was really excited cuz I love all the movies and he's a living legend at this point.

I got all the way up to him super excited after waiting so long in the hot sun.  He looked really disappointed at my poster and angrily yelled back to of of his staff or something ""Who the hell is making these??? These aren't ours! Where did you get this???"" 

I had no  idea what to say and I can't remember what I mumbled but he saw that I was pretty terrified to have angered him and asked my name and signed the poster and smiled..  I always think of this whenever I watch the movies and laugh.  RIP George!! &&Protect Tom Savini at all costs.&&Something tells me he'll be back...

R.I.P. George.  (For 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on which Zombie Universe we're in.)&&>Romero died Sunday in his sleep after a “brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer” according to a statement to The Times provided by his longtime producing partner, Peter Grunwald. Romero died while listening to the score of one his favorite films, 1952’s “The Quiet Man,” with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina Romero, at his side, the family said.

He died twice. Confirmed he did come back briefly as a zombie.
   &&Knightriders. 
Monkey Shines. 
The Crazies. 
Those Zombie Flicks. 

He was amazing. &&This is a sad day for me. His movies were favorites of my childhood (speaking as a former zombie-movie-loving kid).

In the spirit of a wake, [here's ""The Gonk"" from *Dawn of the Dead*](https://youtu.be/V66m52YFZBg)&&And I see he just respawned on call of the dead!/s

RIP man. You made the genre cool.

(Please don't resurrect and be a zombie)&&Beyond being a fantastic filmmaker, we might not have had The Walking Dead, Shaun of the Dead, 28 Days Later, World War Z Zombieland, or most zombie media without his influence. RIP...until he walks the earth again.&&They better cremate him, otherwise he might come back &&[deleted]&&This has ruined my day. RIP you genius&&Damn, this one hurts to hear.  He was such a *huge* part of my childhood with his 'Dead' films.  I had recently read that he was talking about doing another one too.  Sad news.  RIP.&&The guy left a huge mark on pop culture when you think about it. The popularization of zombies as undead flesheaters was huge, I mean, they're like a new modern mythical creature, but there's also a profound effect he had on the way that popular horror movies worked. After *Night* horror movies stopped being for little kids, as [noted by Roger Ebert.](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-night-of-the-living-dead-1968)&&NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&&Shit. That sucks. I've been a huge horror fan for almost my entire life and George A. Romero was a big part of it. RIP&&A true legend. RIP.&&Shit, this really sucks. Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead is a truly brilliant trilogy of films, and he was hugely influential over multiple decades. RIP&&This is awful news. He was a sweet man, and a personal hero of mine. &&RIP Uncle George.  
Please honor him by watching 1981's [Knightriders](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082622/).  
Its possibly his most personal film and an absolute blast to watch. It's about a traveling RenFaire whose centerpiece is a motorcycle-mounted jousting tourney. They are trying to exist on their own outside the grid of showbizness in the late 70s (echoes of George's own indie world) and keep it together without outside money and the influence of burgeoning fame.  
It's an intense Ed Harris in one of his earliest roles and he commands the screen and while some of the other performances have a smaller-scale shoestring quality to them I think you'll be surprised at how great legendary FX artist/stuntman Tom Savini is in it as rival to the crown Morgan the Black Knight. He absolutely holds his own against Harris and probably could have had a career as a genre action actor if he decided to go that route.  
It's one of my favorite films of all time and really digs in and rises above its grindhousey premise, even though it delivers on that premise in spades.  
Here is one of the [best scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O75VFBvXtQ) from it. &&Holy fuck, I just watched Night for the first time today and this is surreal. RIP Romero&&Absolute legend, RIP.&&What sad day. Horror just lost one of its heavy hitters. &&Rip romero, my love for flesh eating zombies started with you.&&When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth. RIP Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite movies ever. &&Such an influence. Sad to see him leave us.&&I still remember watching Dawn of the Dead on a pirate VHS when I was way too young. Terrified and excited. One of the very few cultural highlights of the 80's for me. His influence will never die!&&From a Pennsylvanian, Rest in Peace.



Thanks for making cities like Pittsburgh relevant in major motion pictures.&&A legend for sure. 

Really wish he had been able to get his Resident Evil project off the ground without being kicked off it &&He paved the way for the ""black leading man"" in his Night of the Living Dead, making sure to address race by never bringing it up in the first place. That is the first thing I noted in my initial viewing of the film, and hope that in the future lectures dedicated to his brilliance as a horror filmmaker, they take note of how socially conscious he was as a time where that kind of mindset was a career suicide. &&Invented a genre that will never die, RIP Romero, long live the zombie.&&Night, Dawn, and Day of the Dead all hold a special place in my heart. I know 77 is a good life, but I'm going to miss him.&&He came into my restaurant and I got to serve him, unknowingly at first.

It was a group of 9 people and the whole meal they were discussing filming and wardrobe and ""on location"" and other movie making terms. At the end of the meal they thanked me so I took the opportunity to ask what kind of movies they made.

Lady at table: ""Well, do you like horror movies?""
Me: ""Ehh not really.. just the classic George A. Romero type stuff.""

The table erupts in laughter and I don't understand why. The lady points to the elderly gentleman at the table and says ""That's George A. Romero.""

Went and shook his hand and thanked him for his work. Next day his manager came in and gave me a signed photo and passes to the event they were participating in that weekend. 

Sad to see him go, glad I got to meet the legend.&&""I'll never live long enough to arrive at some sort of peaceful co-existence of some kind. That's probably the only way you could end it on a note of promise, which would mean the zombies would learn how to eat Spam or chicken livers, instead of your liver. But I'll never get to that point."" George A. Romero

Awake In Peace George&&""Don't do it until you are sure I'm coming back. I'm going to try not to come back."" Rest in peace to a man who put strong black leads in films when black characters were cast as white people in black face. Who always had something to say. The world is poorer for this loss. &&No need to come back because he legacy will live on.

Good night, George. You are such an inspiration.

""You was Wooley's unit, ain't you?""

""I didn't see nothing man. I didn't see how he died.""&&Operator dead, post abandoned.&&My tattoo artist and I were talking about Romero just yesterday. Both big zombie fans, but once he started talking more about the Dead movies I could see how much he dug Romero's work.

In a 4 hour session, he told me all about the practical effects used like the screw driver scene, to the references to consumer culture, which eventually lead into it's impact on Italian horror and Zombi 2, etc,  tons of info I had never heard.  

Reading this made me feel for him, dude must have just lost a hero.&&Damn. Just terrible.

Hope you don't stay dead for long, sir.&&George A. Romero, undead at 77&&I worked on ""Land of the Dead"" here in Toronto.  It was a great honor being in the film even though I was just a background actor and didn't get to have any interaction with George.  It was a great experience being that I was a film student a few years earlier and I loved watching it all come together.  The icing on the cake... Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright were both on set that day as well and it was a long shoot but a lot of fun.  

You can see me in the background of the zombie cage fight scene and walking around a bit.  Also I got selected to be the zombie clown's body double (no nudity).  I'll remember the experience for the rest of my life.  &&Call of the dead is a great map&&I know the thread's ageing now. But here's George acting in one of his greatest movies: Martin. 

He plays a Priest summoned to perform an exorcism at the house of a superstitious old man who's accusing the title character of being a vampire. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pFg24yv4Jk&&Just saw this a minute ago...R.I.P. to one of my favorites. &&God, what a terrible loss. He was considered the Father of modern Zombie movies. Hollywood is really gonna be at a loss without him. RIP&&Sad news, RIP legend.&&I'll never forget the first time my parents let me stay at home for the night alone while they went on a date. 

Stayed up till midnight and then Night of the Living Dead came on the TV. I was so enthralled. First time I ever watched a black and white movie and wasn't bored. &&one of the greatest horror movies every made....its still fucking creepy&&IIRC they messed up the copyright paperwork and the movie became public domain. &&If nothing else watch the first 10 minutes or so. Its truly wonderful filmmaking&&I truly hope Hollywood gives him his due in the coming days. His fingerprints are all over modern horror. Greg Nicotero worked on several of his ""Living Dead"" sequels. Wonder what he is saying.....&&The movie that started it all. Not the first zombie movie that I ever saw but holy shit if it all didnt make so much more sense after I finally saw Night of the Living Dead. Thats where it all came from. My love of the zombie genre is strong and I have George A. Romero to thank for all of it. I cant wait until he digs his way out of his grave so scare us all one more time. &&Definitely watching this one again in his memory. &&I don't know, I don't think I'd want to be alone in a room with David Cronenberg...&&That's why you make sure not to shoot him! &&*So c-c-c-cold!*&&r/CODZombies mourns with you&&You can't run from me!! Well... you can... But DOOOON'T&&Man, killing him ""in game"" now would be bittersweet.&&*We're all friends here!*&&It saddens me that nobody seems to mention call of the dead and the fact it wasn't included in zombies chronicles was just the cherry on top&&Time to fire up the 360 and play that map&&Director on set!&&""Get back to makeup, you're not dead enough!""&&This is what introduced me to George. Even though in small ways, he affected me. It's crazy how an iteration of a real person in a video game is how we know some people now adays.&&
He'll be back&&Yep. If it wasn't for this guy, zombies never would've gotten popular. We wouldn't have The Walking Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland or anything.&&The ""Godfather of the Dead."" RIP.&&Didn't he essentially invent the pop culture zombie? &&all the zombie video games and movies and literature owe him a lot.&&This is the first celeb death to get a literal ""Wow"" out of me since Robin Williams&&I also feel he was very much the forefront of horror as a social and political metaphor rather than just as a 'thrill'. The ending of Night of the Living Dead remains exceedingly relevant today (unfortunately!)

&&Thanks! ive seen 'Silence' 10+ times, never picked up the cameo.&&And the main detective was Neighbor Aber from Mister Rogers. &&Double tap. He'd understand &&He will probably come out of the water in a couple of rounds though.&&He will live on as a metaphor for modern consumerism...or something...&&Removing the head or destroying the brain. &&Road of the dead right? Shame. His latest movies were so so but his contribution to cinema really can't be overstated.

&&He was right in bashing The Walking Dead. As someone I follow just said on Twitter, TWD turned his work with zombies into a McDonalds.&&Wait, what? What did he say?&&I wondering what will come of that production now&&Soap opera with zombies.  Well...he's not wrong.&&people should also definitely give Monkey Shines a chance. That movie is just super weird and lots of fun.&&I didn't know he did Creepshow, loved that film.&&Always liked The Dark Half myself.&&Knightriders is a really underrated gem.&&upvoted for Martin because it traumatized me at 12-13 and I want to spread the love&&Long time smoker living to 77 is a bit unexpected&&Martin is one of my top vampire movies of all time. Such a gem.&&Martin is probably my favorite ""vampire"" movie.&&The Crazies is my favourite film of all time. The only film to genuinely scare me. The premise is terrifying to me. Totally under rated, so am happy to see you mention it. The remake wasn't as awful as I feared it would be either, but the original has much more atmosphere & tension. &&The Crazies remake is pretty damn good. &&Martin is hands down one of my favorite movies and totally turned me onto film as an art form. Some may disagree but the atmosphere and crawl blew my mind as a kid &&I actually enjoyed Land of the Dead, it isn't anywhere near his best but it continued to create an interesting concept in the world of zombies.&&It's one of the greatest movies of all time.

It nails the horror genre, the B-movie camp, and is an incisive social commentary on 1980's consumerism and human behavior. 

Night of the Living Dead is politically and cinematically revolutionary, Day of the Dead is nuanced and intelligent, his 2000s era 'of the Dead' films are cheap cable productions that are still wise and profound - and enjoyable than most movies and tv of today.&&I love the new Dawn of the dead, it's my favorite Blu Ray I own&&Night, Dawn, Land, and Diary were all great. Shame Survival was such trash.&&Who the fuck only knows George Romero for his later work? &&The original Dawn of the Dead is one of my all-time favorite movies, and easily my favorite in the horror genre. I once wrote an essay for a class exploring its subthemes and cultural significance. Rest In Peace, George. You got life by the ass. &&[deleted]&&Yay Monroeville Mall!  It was the closest mall for me growing up. I used to walk around finding all the locations in the movie. I was sad when they got rid of the ice rink. &&That's so cool. &&My neighbor was a police officer.&&Science fiction had Lucas. Action movies had Spielberg. 

But horror? Horror we had Romero. And we are richer for it. &&Creepshow and The Crazies are my personal favorites. Much more to his filmography than just zombies &&My favorite of his has always been Creepshow. 

Horror has so many unique and insanely talented artists lurking in it, Romero is such a legend. &&I love Martin!

Check this song out by Soft Cell - Martin.

https://youtu.be/otXsKy27cvk&&Yup Martin's a classic. That ending rivals Night of the Living Dead's ending. 

The Crazies is also another solid movie. Romero's cultural and political undercurrent to all his films is top notch. He pulled it off better than anyone. &&I always liked Bruiser. Saw it on one of those free movies on demand things. Worth a watch &&Yes

You cant argue that. He started the whole modern zombie genre.&&Night of the Living Dead was also one of the first movies to have a black protagonist. Romero was ahead of his time, for sure. &&>  beyond sad

Ultra-sad prime&&For me it's Dawn of the Dead, but otherwise yeah.&&http://i.imgur.com/uINQKQP.gif&&I have a Bub portrait on my right arm and a graveyard scene below it. His movies were/are a big part of my film appreciation. &&He might have been fucking with you to get a laugh-- he famously didn't own Night of the Living Dead due to a copyright mishap. &&It's gonna feel super weird seeing him in the ""In Memoriam"" segment at the next Oscars.&&If they cremate him, all the rest of the dead might get infected. &&Now I'm double sad. Romero is dead and Ebert passed 4 years ago. Aging kinda sucks.&&Watch Dawn and Day next. Just as fantastic.&&Hollywood never wanted him. Hollywood never appreciated him. Horror is the redheaded stepchild of Hollywood. None of the greats of the genre get recognized. Not even fucking Alfred Hitchcock got an Oscar. &&""They're coming to get you Barbara""&&My all time favorite movie. Glad you appreciated it.&&I had a similar experience Kandoh. Night of the Living Dead made me become a storyteller. Sad day, but universal stories like yours make me feel better. Thanks K. &&I remember being a kid seeing it for the first time, and not realizing what I was watching when I changed channels to it... black and white... a woman in a graveyard, and a dude walking toward her.  Stumbling, not walking.  Drunk?  Nah... maybe...  

Then he catches his foot on the bottom of his suit and rips it down off of his shoulders, the whole thing falls down around around him because they slit the suit to put it on his corpse!  It hit me, i freaked, the chick on screen freaked!  

And I was glued, couldn't stop watching!

Terrifying greatness!  I'll never forget that slow ambling of the first zombie I ever saw...&&I had recurring nightmares for years after that.  It looks tame in retrospect but he had a huge impact on popular culture.

&&Barbara's death is one of the most chilling I've ever seen - you don't even see it, you just see her, screaming, being dragged into a sea of man-eating ghouls, and then she disappears into the mass. Terrifying.

The ending is pretty shocking too.&&Hence it being on YouTube and having no chance of being pulled.&&Or Roman Polanski if you are an under age girl.&&Or Bryan ""I keep James McAvoy's Hair in a Safe"" Singer.&&David Cronenberg looks like he has a human skin mask collection. He's a scary looking guy.&&Or Lynch.&&But how else will I get the Wunderwaffe DG-3 after completing the Easter egg?&&Such bullshit that Call of the Dead wasn't remade for BO3.&&You keep surprising me! &&He always comes back atleast!&&Yeah CotD was one of my favorite maps... it wasn't remastered because it didn't have the original 4 but damn did I wish they gave it the treatment they gave other maps. The Zombie Chronicles remastered are amazing.&&You can play it on the one if you have it. Or PC.&&Call of the Dead taught me that much&&...when there's no more room in hell&&And we'll have to shoot him in the head...he would have wanted it that way.  &&Would have never had Return of the Living Dead, which is one of the most important in the Zombie Realm.&&not just films and tv either, think of how video games and literature would have been affected - you wouldn't have World War Z, The Last of Us, Left 4 Dead. It's almost unprecedented.&&May he rise again and devour our brains. &&Yep. George A. Romero, Dan O'Bannon, and Lucio Fulci deserve most of the credit.

&&Yup, he at least added the undead element. Before Romero, zombies were drugged up slave labor.&&There is no zombie culture without him&&Yes, the concept of a ""zombie"" being a corpse that was re-animated with a hunger for human flesh and being bitten by one turned you into a zombie was his creation.

There would be no Walking Dead, no World War Z and no Shaun of the Dead (among many others) without him.&&He was even in one.&&Seems fitting &&Nah, that's a bit much. I'll just poke him really quick to make sur- HE'S NOT DEAD HE'S NOT DEAD&&He'd want it that way.&&Do you have any regrets?&&Rule 2 of the Zombie Apocalypse. Right behind Cardio.&&Wasn't sure if I would see a [black ops reference.](http://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif)&&Before: ""*Message? We were out in Pittsburgh making a monster flick.*""  

After: ""*The social message was all my idea, from the very beginning.*""&&[deleted]&&I'm not a big fan of his newer zombie flicks. The last one I saw the zombies had started using guns and were humanely shooting people instead of eating them. It seemed like he pulled a George Lucas, the sequels completely missed the point of what makes zombies scary, in my opinion. &&i dont know about that, but it is very stale at this point&&TWD is pretty much repeater mode. Same shit, different locations, over and over. &&To be fair, zombies were already pretty played out by the time TWD premiered. It certainly didn't help.&&He essentially said it was a ""soap opera"".&&Probably the movie of his I've seen the most times (along with *Creepshow*) because it was on cable so much in the late '80s and early '90s.  I love it. 

Be sure to listen to the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast episode on *Monkey Shines*; very entertaining. &&""METEOR SHIT!""&&I was an extra in it! Filmed on my campus in Washington PA. Got to hand out with Timothy Hutton between takes, bummed a smoke from me.&&Day of the Dead is fantastic also. The original script was apparently much bigger scale and a chunk of it was reworked into Land of the Dead.&&Land of the Dead was ruined by the fact that at some point someone actually pointed out to Romero that his films had social messages. Then he became aware and started doing it on purpose, and it just didn't work.&&It was the first Romero movie I watched in theater, and I loved it. The [intro itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ5HpO6hu8Y) did a great job of setting up the right mood and retelling the story. Also the game was awesome. Just [check the music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQIUFAcGvyk&index=15&list=PLEEB8021428DF25B8).

&&Fantastic Movie. [The intro with the Johnny Cash song is insane.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdddUJWIj_M)&&It's absolutely one of the best newer zombie movies that isn't a comedy although that zombie baby sure was hilarious. I wrote a post a bit ago about my theory on how the dog in that movie was actually the lord of zombies, and how the people at the mall weren't nearly in as much danger as they thought they were in. [I even used math and stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/6jf5lr/dawn_of_the_dead2004_mallandy_people_were_not_in/).&&He was just the writer, Zack Snyder was the director and it was above and beyond Snyder's best theatrical release. But Romero did Diary of the Dead which was great and doesn't get enough credit&&Diary of the dead has that amazing pool scene.  It's brilliant!&&HAha yep, that's him&&Wes Craven too&&As much as I respect Romero and what he has done for the genre, I'd give the honor of ""biggest horror movie influence"" to Alfred Hitchcock.  Don't get me wrong, Romero was instrumental in defining a whole new sub-genre of horror, but I don't think his influence is as far-reaching as Hitchcock.&&Creepshow is so criminally underrated and unknown by so many. George A. Romero directs, Stephen King writes, and Tom Savini on FX, it's like the holy trinity.&&He was the first black lead to ever be cast in a role that didn't specifically call for a black character&&He was indirectly ahead of the time. He wrote for the character to be just about anybody and Duane Jones simply gave the best performance. In fact if I recall, Duane Jones asked Romero if the fact that he was a black protagonist could be emphasized in the film but Romero decided not to. It was only later did Romero have regrets on not taking Jones' advice, especially after Jones' death in 1988.&&This is.... advanced sadness&&You're ignorant!&&The only movie I had seen at 15 years old to end in such a way. I literally jumped out of the chair and cheered. Favorite movie to this day and until the end of time. No movie gets me as excited as it, and if one does my rose tinted glasses would never admit it.&&Yeah the end is pretty fucked up

The Alien guy?

Damn. Guy's got an underrated legacy. &&FULCI! YES! So pleased to see you mention him. I have a very specific love of Romero & Fulci style films from the late 70s, early 80's. Have been collecting them for years. Anything that fits that kind of description goes in, hokey or not. I can't even describe what the appeal is. I prefer Romero films over all (my lifelong favourite is The Crazies, so not even a zombie film) but any one who has a zombie fighting a shark underwater gets a free pass imho. Going to miss Romero, but as I've said elsewhere , I totally hope he comes back as a zombie. It's what he would've wanted.

Edit : for spelling&&Hatian zombis, as depicted in films like *White Zombie,* were ""dead"" slaves of a bokor (a priest).

According to Hatian/Afro-Carribean lore, there are two types of zombis

* A soul without a body that the bokor imprisons in a jar.

* A body without a soul that the bokor can control to do his bidding. These zombis were mainly exiled, but they could be used for slave labor.

To suffer the wrath of the bokor in such a way, a person would have to do something terrible to the village community. They were then outcast and made into zombis.

Context: The Hatian community was made of the broken families of the slave trade. Because of the devistation caused to the families by the slave trade, the worst punishment given to a member of the community was exile and made into a zombi slave.&&[deleted]&&Rule 1: Cardio.&&Ummm Garfield
&&I'm gonna need to hit the box first...&&this is a great article and shows how destructive copyright of art can be. think of what we have gained by romeros sacrifice, intentional or not.&&That seems like a fantastic argument against copyright. Without a mistake we wouldn't have so much of our modern pop culture.&&Did you see Diary of the Dead?&&While his films were horror, they were made as social commentary more than anything. Zombies, for him, weren't a set thing. As society changed, so did his monsters. Since, ""It a Zombie. It's not human. Kill it,"" became so well known, he gradually made the zombies display more human characteristics. It makes one doubt reactionary violent action. The Zombies became less scary, but the humans became more so. The humans were always the monsters in his films. He just got a bit heavy handed at times, because the general audience never seemed to notice or care. 

That said I haven't really enjoyed much of his work since Land of the Dead. Still a brilliant man who changed the face of horror and cinema in general. &&I found it fucking hilarious every time a human would do something shitty to a zombie and that one black zombie would always see it and just start screaming &&>The last one I saw the zombies had started using guns and were humanely shooting people instead of eating them.

Yeah but if you're referring to Land of the Dead, that movie was pretty much a huge allegory for the wars in Afghanistan/Iraq and their effects - the zombies using the guns the humans left behind after killing a bunch of zombies and looting the area they were in, or John Leguziamo's character, who was originally hired to kill the rich guy's (Dennis Hopper) enemies literally threatening to ""blow the towers up"" after he got fucked over by the rich guy are just very in-your-face metaphors... I understand your criticism that it perharps made his films less scary, but it's not like he put ridiculous stuff in his movies just for the sake of novelty...&&Yeah.  I *loooved* the first season, every other season after that seems like it's from a different show.  They should have never fired the writers from Season 1.&&At this point? The pilot had promise, but it was almost entirely downhill ever since. &&He's not wrong. The zombies stopped being a true threat during the Prison Arc. It's got drama for dramas sake. You live in a world of zombies and constant fear of death, you don't need to phone in the drama. &&That's always been accurate. Think of it as a drama that has zombies and it's in an apocalyptic setting. Don't watch it for the Zombies watch it because you're invested in the characters&&https://media3.giphy.com/media/gtakVlnStZUbe/giphy.gif&&I've really been enjoying that podcast. &&Creepshow holds a special place in my heart because there is a story my dad likes to tell about me as a child that involves it. 

Apparently when I was very young (two or three) my dad and I were watching the World Series. It might have been Toronto v Cinci? At any rate, there was a commercial so my dad starts scanning channels. He comes across some apparent drama, and since I'm so young and can't make since of much, leaves it on. What's the worst that can happen? 

Well, soon he is engrossed and forgets I'm on his lap. A cuckolded husband has buried his wife and the man she has been sleeping with up to their necks in sand. When they ask what to do as the tide rolls in, he tells them, ""You can hold your breath."" 

Apparently this was all fine, but what wasn't fine was when the waterlogged corpses return from the dead to wreak vengeance on the man who murdered them. My dad had been flipping back and forth between channels, so at the next World Series commercial break, here comes a seaweed covered, cyan, wrinkled raisin monster moaning, ""You can hold your breath."" The extreme close up threw me into a howling terror of my own. My dad (who had no idea this was coming) flipped the television back over to a commercial and calmed me down by asking me questions about baseball. 

The film in question was Creepshow, and I've since watched it many times as a teenager, and as an adult. I think my love of the horror genre was somehow born as a result of that moment, and I have Mr. Romero to thank.

Edit: A word.&&""June is makin' sure all the Monkey Shines gettin' paid.""&&I absolutely adore Day of the Dead.

The claustrophobic and cynical feel to it, the ethereal music and the massive leap in the quality of zombie makeup made it one of those very memorable movies whose images are permanently etched into my brain.

The characters are brilliant. The role reversal with the strong female lead and her hopeless boyfriend was great and very different where movies where dominated by hyper-masculine leading men. The duo of the Irish radio operator (the actor's actually from my hometown) and Caribbean chopper pilot were great too, as was the mad scientist and the power hungry army captain.&&Tom Savini said that it was supposed to be the ""Ben Hur"" of zombie films. Original script [here](http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dayofthedead.txt). It's fucking amazing. 

That said, Romero's Day of the Dead will continue to be my favorite zombie film of all time. 

To Valhalla, George Romero. Thank you for my most cherished cinematic experiences. &&It's available online of you search around.    Basically the military base was on an island ruled by a former Govenor who lives like Calligula  while the military serve as muscle.  And there's scientists with an army of Bud the Zombies.  &&Remember the part in Day when that soldier's head gets ripped off and you can hear his scream get higher pitched as his vocal cords stretch? I'll never forget that awful sound.&&Yep, glad I'm not the only one who thought that. It became heavy handed after that. Still a decent movie though. &&[That jump thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6EZGMlgX0&feature=youtu.be&t=46) the little girl did in the beginning was amazing.&&That opening scene in the newer Dawn of the Dead is horrifying. The zombie child, the mad scramble through the suburb full of frantic people first thing in the morning. 

1. Nobody ever depicts societal breakdown kinds of stuff happening at 6:30 in the morning.

2. Most movies just skip over the whole breakdown part of a disaster. The 90's Stand did an admirable job but it was a mini series. &&Ah shit. I love that post. Great film and great post. Thanks. &&John Carpenter too&&And Cronenberg. &&Craven and Romero. Both gone now. I am so glad see a new generation come to fill their void in the last few years. It Follows, The Witch, Get Out. They carry the fire.&&You're right that Hitchcock is the master, but OP is correct in his comparison. You could easily point to great directors before Lucas and Spielberg like John Ford or Howard Hawks, even Fritz Lang, but for an entire generation it was what OP's three did that helped them fall in love with movies. &&Agree and disagree. Hitchcock was a master in a way that his work was genre crossing. I.E. The Birds vs Psycho vs Rear Window are all completely different levels of what's scary about them, where the horror and suspense come from.

However, I think Romero is special in that he didn't just invent zombies. He was a prototype for indie filmmakers.

Far removed from the Hollywood system(working primarily in Pittsburgh), funded his films with what he and his friends could scrap together, and what he put on screen pushed the limits of what Hollywood was showing in terms of violence and gore. 

Romero was a precursor of the independent spirit that Lucas, Spielberg, Coppolla, Scorsese and more get credited with in the 70s. 

So I think the OP's comparison is correct, as I view Hitchcock as part of the old Hollywood system. While Romero, Lucas, et al are all contemporaries.&&Great cast too.  Leslie Nielson, Ted Danson, Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris(anyone remember his goofy dance?).  The Night, Dawn, Day trilogy are considered his best works(and rightfully so) but Creepshow is my personal favorite.  ""The Crate"" segment is especially memorable with that awesomely terrifying creature hiding in the box.  Used to scare the shit out of me growing up.

He may be the most kind man in existence, but his artistic mind freaks me out as much as I admire it. &&He seems like such a nice guy in Twin Peaks. It's so hard for me to picture him making all these surreal creepy movies. &&David Lynch is essentially playing himself when he plays Gordon Cole in Twin Peaks.&&> He's just uniquely sensitive to the craziness of the world.

Lynch refused to swear on the set of Blue Velvet because he said the movie was vulgar enough as it was. Sounds about right.&&The guy practices Trancendental Yoga and has his own signature brand of coffee beans. I wouldn't say he's not entirely crazy...&&David Lynch once gave Isabella Rossellini a dissected chicken as a gift (entitled ""[How to Assemble a Chicken](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/85/77/0d/85770ddb76ffc3ba16c35019fdbf3e7e--isabella-rossellini-david-lynch.jpg)."") A nice gesture, but a little creepy-crazy.&&Didn't he once say how the entirety of Blue Velvet came to him from a memory when he was young and he saw a naked woman, half (or fully) crazed, shuffling down the street in his neighborhood and it freaked him the fuck out? I'm pretty sure I read that and it is certainly a scene in Blue Velvet. &&My trusty steed.&&YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, LISAAA&&oh hai mark&&IM FED UP WIT DIS WURULD!&&The deer would end up having three eyes or antennae or something, and it would just stare at you until it got its point across, but it would still be an oddly relaxing story.&&I got to touch a deer's antlers the other day.

Good times.&&I thought the brain eating part was actually from the voodoo myths that zombies were borrowed from...&&I think Return of the Living Dead still has the scariest zombies that ever appears on film.

God, I love World at War and Black Ops 1 zombies. Changed for the worse in Black Ops 2, but still enjoyable. &&I'm not too far down the thread yet but I haven't seen Resident Evil mentioned.&&I know i could obviously just google it but let me guess. He made the movie zombi 2?

Am i right or wrong guy?&&yea his [eye gouging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wMOYNFlaCY) and [zombie shark eating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5MIF3gqREE) scenes were classic for the time&&> The Alien guy?

You may know him as the guy who introduced ""BRAAAAINS!"" into popular culture in *Return of the Living Dead* and its sequels. Fun fact: When Russo and Romero parted ways, Russo kept the rights and to make films with the phrase ""Living Dead"" in the title, as well as the modern concept of ghouls (i.e. zombies) he and Romero pioneered in NotLD. He wrote a novel and wanted to make a movie, and so he tapped Dan O'Bannon to do the screenplay and direct. O'Bannon accepted on the condition that he could do major rewrites, and his final script bore no resemblance to Russo's novel.

So it went from Romero to Russo to O'Bannon, but O'Bannon is the guy who came up with the popular idea of zombies eating brains, as well as some other characteristics of the modern zombie in pop culture. 

And yes, O'Bannon was underrated. He was a good writer, a fairly skilled director, and brought a lot of things into pop culture that we take for granted today (He wrote *Alien*, *Alien vs. Predator*, two segments in *Heavy Metal*, and co-wrote *Lifeforce, Invaders From Mars*, and *Total Recall*, as well as doing computer animation on the original *Star Wars*) but his passing in 2009 went mostly unnoticed by the general public. 

&&I'm guessing you love yourself some Dario Argento too? Suspiria is my personal favourite 70s/80s horror.&&Fulci *&&I kinda liked Craven's treatment in Serpent and the Rainbow. It hasn't aged terribly well but the zombie-chaser element was fun.&&Rule 2: The Double Tap&&*Record Scratch*

Yep, that's me.  I bet you're wondering ""How'd he end up here running from Zombie Romero""?&&Are you a fellow boxaholic?&&Of course, all of those who have gained from Romero's loss made sure *their* copyrights are watertight I'm sure. &&With the exception that the distributor pocketed all the money from the film meanwhile Romero and Russo got shit. That was pretty fucked &&* For limited copyright. I'm ok with a copyright between 14-28 years that can be renewed by the creator or his heirs (NOT the corporate owners). Which is what we used to have in the US before we joined Bern. 

A shorter length, of say 28 years, would mean the artist themselves would get rewarded, and could even renew it if it becomes worth valuable enough. 

That whole by the artist or their heirs thing was an interesting twist of US law. The artist could sign something that would be he would automatically renew as part of their publication contracts. But it did not apply to the family (some later contracts had the families sign). It makes it so if say, your parent dies after creating an unexpected hit, you had a much stronger tool for rights controls for your kids.

The biggest thing we have now is a confusion between Anglo-sphere utilitarian publisher oriented copyright and Continental rights of the author.  The Anglo tradition has copyright designed around a utilitarian trade off to give publisher rights to promote a spread of work. The French have a differing approach, based on the natural rights of the author.

While I respect the natural rights approach, it's become this unwieldly thing that's giving artists rights for life + to large publishers and slowing the introduction of material into the public domain. It helps big media, and a very few artists on the high end. Most artists of less than major notice will fade quickly. 

Rant over!&&I mean, yes and no. Part of the reasoning for copyright is good. I have a friend who's an artist. If I get a print of one of her pieces, reproduce it, and make a business selling T-shirts with that design on it without her consent, that's wrong. That's not mine. I'm basically stealing the piece and all the derivative profit for it from its creators at that point, and I shouldn't be able to do that. We see artists getting shafted like this all the time online, because it's hard to track down who's really behind the shit you buy online.

At the same time, if I made a Wonder Woman comic today with a completely original plotline that I illustrated myself and it was a fucking masterpiece that revolutionized the way people would see her forever...I'd get sued, lose all that money I made from it and probably all the rest of the money I already have. That's...less reasonable.

Legislating art is legislating ideas and that's *hard*.&&Was that the shaky cam one? I might have to re-watch it, it's been many years.&&I loved that one! You can't beat a (SPOILER-Sorry I suck at mobile formatting) a guy scything himself in the face. It was a very entertaining movie. &&Surprisingly good return to the craft. &&We need to remember too that when NotLD came out, it was horrifying to kill your neighbors and loved ones, even if they were suddenly trying to kill you. The concept of ""that isn't little Suzy anymore"" hadn't entered the collective consciousness. When viewers originally saw a daughter kill and eat a parent, that concept alone was objectively horrifying. The idea that someone would want to kill (whats left of) your daughter was a deep, emotionally intense concept. The concept that you might kill your daughter *before* they turned was mind bending, especially in days long before euthanasia and similar frank and practical concepts of death and dying were discussed or considered remotely reasonable by the average person.

Heck, just the horror element of ""Us"" becoming ""Them"" was still fairly underutilized in film, and still had a lot of shock value to the average movie goer. Cannibalism and body horror warrant their own discussion too.

But things changed. Because of these films, but also because of the evolution of horror and changes in current events and public zeitgeist, these elements became less shocking, and played less to the latent fears of the populous. As an example, in the decades after his first film, America lost some of its racial, cultural, and spiritual unity. We were no longer shocked at the concept that our neighbor may be our enemy. The public opinion on the matter went from being shocked by the concept, to having a constant underlying suspicion, to being tired of being told to be afraid of our neighbors (but still being afraid of our neighbors.) He tried, with varying levels of success, to adapt his films to the changes in his audience, changes in the world, and changes in the way his audience viewed the world. 

In short, the real horror in NotLD was not that you would die from some monster, but that society would break down and your closest allies would turn against you, and you would have to fight back. This became a tired trope both in movies and reality. Humanizing the zombies is meant to make you more emotionally conflicted by treating them as an enemy, and the other struggles the characters face are supposed to represent the horrors of reality at the time. Even then, these changes are only somewhat effective. In a world where many are salivating for a reason to turn on their fellow man, many modern zombie films can no longer have the same impact, even when dramatically retooled. The core concept is simply less disturbing.  &&Never should have stretched the season length out either, I could see ten episodes max but even sixteen is too much for TWD. So much fucking filler.&&The first season was fantastic. If you count it as a six episode miniseries, it's one of the best zombie creations to date.&&Director and visionary of Season 1 was fired after Season 1. 

There's no real indication of why, we can only assume. There's some chatter that He and the producers were butting heads about the direction of the show--this, after he made the first season on a shoe-string budget, brought some of his friend actors to be part of the show (possibly for less pay than desired). 

There's plenty of speculation as to the producers wanting to stretch out the show, with the least amount of money, because TWD is the only show AMC 100% owns.

They're beating the living daylight out of that Goose that lays golden eggs.&&Best episode: season two ""Better Angels"".  It starts out with a Rick reading dale's eulogy/zombie hunting trip cut together, it's amazing.
https://youtu.be/AN3l_f8m1SE&&That's essentially because it is, Frank Darabont was the man behind season 1, after season 1 AMC nuked him and his vision for the show went with him. &&I creamed my pants when i saw the pilot.

Up to that point i probably had watched every single zombie movie, no matter how bad it was. To have a series coming out with such strong production quality anr an excellent pilot i was ecstatic. 

These days I don't watch them anymore... i suppose if there were another 28 x later movie I would watch it, but other than that it's just blah&&Getting rid of Frank Darabont fucked it up. Dude's a wizard. How do fire the guy who made Shawshank?&&I completely agree with this. Season 1 was tense and concise, everything after that is so slow and full of plot holes and terrible writing. &&I stopped watching a few episodes into season 3 when it was apparent that a simple story would be drawn out like the previous season. I can't believe that the show has stayed popular for so long now. &&To be fair I've always enjoyed the  Zombie genre because it tends to use the backdrop of flesh eating corpses walking the earth as a means of examining human nature.  The Walking Dead (the show not the graphic novels) has taken it to such an extreme that it feels like it's being shoved down viewer's throats.&&Day of the Dead is one of the only horror movies I can't often rewatch. It's just so bleak, depressing, and disgusting that I always feel tainted after watching it. Dawn may be the ""better"" movie, but Day gave me a stronger emotional reaction.&&The opening scene, where that Florida city goes from completely still and lifeless to crawling with the undead that have arisen after who the fuck knows how long, is the best and creepiest post apocalyptic scene of all time. The mystery of everything, the 80s synth music going. I love it &&This is my favorite Romero movie ever. I've seen it at least a thousand times and anytime I can't decide on what to watch, I pop Day on the TV and that's that.&&Day of the Dead terrified me as a youngster - it's so bleak. I watched the intro a while back, where they fly the chopper into a coastal city to look for survivors, but only find a horde of the undead. It sets it up so well (apart from the awful synth music) - there's no hope. The scientist/military mission is pointless. Everyone is already gone. Still gives me shivers. 

Rest in peace, George. Until you rise again. &&Not to mention the gore effects in Day were just go gut-wrenchingly good. I mean holy shit, those were some nauseating moments of gore.&&Carpenter's a goddamn chameleon, he's influential on genre movies in general, not just horror - thrillers, sci-fi, action, you name it, Carpenter's dipped his toe in it at some point and left a sizeable impression.&&Or reddit if you're OPs mom. &&Or Michael Bay if you have any self respect &&Wait what? What did I miss? &&Or Adam Johnston if you're a horse.&&And make sure he pumps out as many good movies as possible before one of those kids grows up and fucking murders him.&&Adopted, *adult* daughter, it should be pointed out.&&Or Lena Dunham if you're her sister&&You can't prove he didn't do both.&&Literally was just watching that movie 10 minutes ago.

What a coincidence&&That's a great description of the effect of his films.&&More or less how I felt about HR Geiger. He could be Fred Rogers of his country, but his art style is so deeply equally unsettling and erotic I'd just feel uncomfortable around him.&&He did say when he was younger he suffered from uncontrollable rage of which he said was inexplicable. He did say that meditating saved him but that he spent a lot of time being unable to stop being angry. &&You watched Twin Peaks and thought ""this seems like it was made by a nice man with a solid grasp on reality""?&&If you read Lynch's bios, you'll learn that he grew up as a very sweet, polite kid very sheltered in white collar suburbia. However, he always took note of the weird, mysterious things that stood out (like roadkill infested with bugs). 

When he started his art career, he took up living in a semi-abandoned warehouse in Philadelphia where bodies of dead hookers were found on the sidewalk on a regular basis, and he tried (and failed) to support a wife and daughter. 

The real world hit Lynch in the worst way possible, and the tension being his gentle childhood and traumatizing early adulthood is present in almost all his work.

Dawn of the dead was his best by a mile IMO.

One of my favorites was in City of the Living Dead, when the chick is vomiting up her intestines and bleeding out her eyes. It was a striking image.

all of the other reasons people are about to list in this thread are symptoms, but THAT is the reason. you can't take 8 or 10 episodes worth of material and stretch them out to nearly double that, which they have been doing since season 2. it just doesn't work.&&There is a society of people in the current season that has essentially forgotten how to speak english. How long since society crumbled? 3 years maybe? give me a break...&&[I've always like this talk explaining what kind of happened.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCyjdBac6p4)

I stuck through TWD to the season 7 first episode, just because even though it was clearly just pandering to drag it out as long as they can with so many cliche's, there was still some entertainment. But the season 6 finale really pissed me off, and although I wouldn't mind seeing the direction they took Negan in, fuck them, there are way more better shows to watch at the moment.&&They only killed that actor off because of things behind the scenes.&&I don't get how this show works. It just ruins tension by fragmenting episodes into individual storylines. Like, I get why, but entire episodes being dedicated to characters I don't give a shit about didn't sit well with me. I haven't been able to get into it with earnest since S3. &&Give the comics a shot. Almost everything is done better in the comics, and the pacing of reading issue to issue, now that so many are out, makes the story flow really well and never drag on.&&It stayed popular because they fired the showrunner after season 3 and went back to mostly following the storyline of the comics rather than the clusterfuck that season 3 turned into. Season 2 suffered from the loss of Darabont at the start of the season, and the loss of the first episode because Darabont fucked up the filming and produced unusable footage (I've seen the 'lost episode' footage and it's absolutely abysmal) and caused season 2A to end up overstretched.

That said, a lot of people started to bitch and whine about the show getting boring as soon as they reached Alexandria and got a long-term settlement. Those people would be awfully disappointed to know how long they stay in Alexandria in the comics :P&&Oh, I love that too. It's why World War Z (book) is so amazing, it's so grounded and human and it explores international human experience with zombies as a backdrop.

Walking dead uses them to kill off characters when their drama isn't entertaining anymore.&&>Dawn may be the ""better"" movie, but Day gave me a stronger emotional reaction.

 1.through numbers (money, ratings, viwership)

 2.the firing of the director of Season 1 (along with plenty of his friends (actors) ""dying"" within the show for no story-based reason (see Dale's absolute random death).

3. AMC's **ONLY** 100% owned property being TWD

All of this meaning, the producers started milking it at Season 2.

I spent the whole book thinking that the obvious choice would be to destroy OASIS...but again, it wasn't apparent whether or not the author intended for it to appear as such a horrible thing, or for even his ""good guy"" characters to be such horrible people.

It reads like it was written by a 10th grader in a future lit class. Ready Player One is to 80s Video Game Nerds as Fifty Shades of Grey is to Horny Lonely Women.

Plus plot devices are introduced, used and never mentioned again all in the span of like two pages and the moral of the story is hammy, unconvincing, and just kinda tacked on.


Sorry about the rant everyone, I just finished it two days ago and I'm not used to reading bad writing these days.



This is a rare case where I think the movie is going to be 100x better than the book, because a competent screenwriter can do wonders with the story and a visual medium will nullify the dry voice of the novel. Plus Steven Spielberg is a very, very talented man.&&The only hope I have for the project is that Spielberg will change enough of the source material to make it fun. 

Like he did with Jurassic Park. &&Book had some fun stuff in it, and a lot of cringe. I'm sure that will be cranked up in the movie.&&Nostalgia is the thematic heart and soul of the book&&The book is cringey and terribly written. But I listened to the audiobook twice. It's a fun popcorn book, and I really love the concept of the VR world it built. I think this is the general consensus though, and not an unpopular opinion. 

I'm not sure how well this movie will do, given the obvious licensing hurdles they have to deal with. But if they do it well, I can easily see this being a big summer hit. Assuming they fix the issues the book had that made it cringey.&&IMO it's terribly overrated. The amount of nostalgia for mediocre 80s culture made me want to gag. The only reason I kept listening to the audiobook is that I was on a 12-hour flight and had nothing else to entertain me. However, I think it could make a really enjoyable film adaptation. &&It's unlikely that they will show a screen that says  ""This video is not available"" in the actual movie.&&I imagine they'll release the trailer next Saturday at Comic-con&&Supposedly he's working on a sequel, buuuut, after Armada, I don't have too much faith in him *really* tackling the stuff he brushed up against. &&Fixing the system is never as sexy, or as fun, or as barely interesting, as fighting the system.&&Maybe it's just missing punctuation.

>Since 2021: more!  
Then, 20 million VR headsets sold.&&> what the hell? Hes not fat, that was a major part of his character

Which didn't make sense to me, for how much he has to ride that bike in the background to generate power, climbing around the housing structures, etc. Maybe Cline just retcon'ed that part of the character&& Yep, this basically throws away the whole fucking middle of the book where he realizes that in order to be better equipped to handle their situation he needs to get back into shape and lose his weight. Hell, that section was even ripe for an 80's montage of getting fit and working out more and more while falling on his ass and throwing up the whole time.

FAIL.&&Right? He gets a treadmill thing - but not while he's hiding in the slums at the beginning of the book.

Since he learned personal connections with people is better than time in the OASIS. &&See I felt the opposite. I felt that the Oasis was just a much better solution to the worlds woes and they should be working on making better and better. When the moral of the story ended up being ""Reality is what really matters."" I kinda groaned because nothing about the story at that point had justified that.

""JUST DO IT!""&&It's OK, not like Spielberg did anything good in the 80's anyway....&&There's some thoughtful stuff, in the front half, about whether (when?) virtual worlds will become more appealing than the real world, especially for working class or unemployed people. [A lot is being done about that in academia](https://www.vox.com/2017/7/13/15964278/weeds-travel-ban-trumpism-workforce-video-games) and it's sometimes colloquially referred to as a ""Ready Player One"" world. 

And, if virtual worlds are going to be a huge part of our lives in the near future, the follow-up questions include all kinds of interesting stuff about virtual economies and corporate control of those worlds, which is tackled in the book in some interesting ways. Again, especially the front half.

But I've seen people on Reddit talk about the book as if it's peerless and brilliant and I really think it's overrated on here. I think Spielberg would be well advised to take the book as what it is and depart from the written word in the numerous places where doing so would be in the best interest of the movie. I think the book can be preachy, predictable, and too cutesy and nostalgia-obsessed occasionally. But what do I know?&&You are correct, but woo boy is this going to rustle some jimmies. &&Really? Someone just gifted it to me and I was really looking forward to reading it.

I know that as the years have passed, we've acknowledged that it's actually beneficial that Twilight happened because it got a whole generation of people into reading.

But they are just so...*bad*.&&Big Bang Theory for readers.&&He was kind of a nice guy™ fantasy character. 
&&I couldn't put the book down but I knew I was reading complete garbage the whole time. &&> This is a rare case where I think the movie is going to be 100x better than the book, because a competent screenwriter can do wonders with the story and a visual medium will nullify the dry voice of the novel. Plus Steven Spielberg is a very, very talented man.

Definitely agree. The concept at least has a lot of potential, which makes me excited to see what Spielberg can do with it, but the writing was pretty awful.&&I agree. It was entertaining I guess, but really poorly written.

It seemed like more of a self-insert fantasy for the author than anything. The main character turned out to be perfect and unbeatable in every way and I ended up really disliking him, to be frank. &&> It reads like it was written by a 10th grader in a future lit class.

This describes exactly how I feel.  Lots of new novels coming out are like this.  I feel like it was written with an adaptation and not a novel being the end goal.  Also his second novel has already had it's film rights sold as if that was the plan from page one.  Seeing as Cline is a screenwriter originally this makes sense to me.  &&He kind of has to, imo. A huge chunk of that book is just the main character sitting around being bored and talking about 80s culture. It isn't going to transfer well to the screen otherwise.&&the non stop bombardment of 80s references is what put me off of it. It was so often forced and unnecessary. The exact moment I had enough and put the book down was when someone said something like ""Stop hitting yourself like Rain Man"". Who talks like that?&&Not just nostalgia: The book creates an ubernerd fantasy where nostalgia and obsession aren't just accepted but are a valued asset in society. 

A world where your nostalgia and knowledge determines your worth as a person. 

It's garbage pail kids. 

&&I liked the book, even if it was basically just an excuse to go on a nostalgia trip. From what I've seen if you were in your 30s when the book was published you love it. Older and younger and it's just OK. 

Better than Armada though, which feels like it was written just to sell the movie rights to a Last Starfighter homage. &&If you want some more cringe, read Armada by the same author.  I just finished reading it and it was rough.&&My thoughts exactly. I was actually a little embarrassed about how much I enjoyed this book. By the end I came away with an overall sense of ""Well.... I can't talk nearly as much crap about people who loved the Twilight novels""&&I gave up on the audiobook like two or three hours in. I just got sick of Wil Wheaton describing goddammed user interfaces. I felt like the author was spending all their time talking about the history of the world, and the rules for how everything worked instead of telling a story. &&Unless the whole movie is a Net Neutrality protest. That would be epic!&&This was a sticking point to me when I read the book (literally finished last week). He had to ride that bike a lot to keep the power for not only the OASIS device, laptops (multiple), and a heater. Heating elements notoriously draw lots of power. Charging the batteries alone *should* have kept him somewhat fit.  That said, he would have gained weight when he finally [moved into the apartment and did the search full time and did almost nothing else- which is also when he decided to get back in shape.](#spoiler). That is unless I'm misremembering the beginning of the book.&&Push it to the limit! Limiiiiiit! &&They had that part where he was getting too chubby to fit into his rig anymore. I laughed when I read that, then I looked in the mirror and cried.&&I didn't get the idea he was fat in the beginning of the book (not in good shape, sure); it was only after Art3mis broke off contact with him that he drowned his sorrows in food, gained weight, and would soon have to get the 'husky' line of haptic suits, etc.  That's when he initiated the exercise lock-out on his Oasis console.&&Maybe this is a pic of him after he lost weight?&&I'm waiting for the disappointment when people don't get every last character (or at least, whichever one they were hoping to see) in the movie.

Words are cheap, so he could litter the book with real '80s references. You want R2D2 as a DJ at a party on the big screen? You're going to pay a fee! That budget can only be so big. 

And there were a TOOOONNNN of references. The book was essentially a list of things that existed in the '80s.

&&He didn't have that tech when he lived in the van though, only when he moved and certain incidents occurred that he got the treadmill in hopes of shedding weight, etc.&&Sorry didn't mean to imply his face was ugly but the way he was described was unkempt, fat, sloppy, and mostly unshowered. 

That's ugly. &&Most people are. &&Which is fucking stupid. The whole turn is the difference between people's real life persona vs virtual persona. &&I'm glad they didn't go that route honestly, destroying OASIS in the end. Yes I get all that stuff about personal connections vs digital connections and how the OASIS overtook culture etc etc - but you have to remember that this is a terrible world people live in (pollution and unemployment etc) and that the OASIS has taken over vital roles that governments seemingly are unable to now cover - for example education is now done through the OASIS, it has an economy equal to or greater than the real-world economy (financial transactions often happen entirely in OASIS credit, even for real-life items), and subsequently people's livelyhoods often depend upon working within it.  
Having an ending of ""I met a girl in real life and so now I have learned real life is better, let's destroy the OASIS"" would have been catastrophic to the world depicted in the novel and cheapened any message it might have had.&&FUCKING NORMIE GET OUT OF MY WISH FULFILLMENT STOREREERRRRRREEEEEEEEEY&&Wreck it Ralph was Disney and they have a lot of capitol. &&RJD2 in the meantime&&buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-b-b8&&RJD2?&&I hope they stick with the sine-curve limb movements. &&Seeing Aug get pissed will be awesome. &&Trumpet hopefully, just like it states in the book&&The whole thing.

&&You just made me think about how, in the book... it is ever stated *why* he's fat? He was living hobo-style in extreme poverty, so where was he getting all those calories? Maybe I just forgot.

**EDIT**: Yo, I'm well aware of the correlation between poverty and obesity, and the nutritional factors involved. In the book, Wade isn't 'working poor' or anything like that (to my recollection). He's basically a junkyard scavenger - don't think there were any McDonald's or convenience stores - who was eating government rations.

Also, I had always assumed that the virtual addiction dynamic presented in the book would manifest more like the stories we (in the West) hear about gaming addiction in China - that people die from heart failure and malnutrition because they play games for days without eating, drinking, or sleeping. The dynamic I pictured is literally the wasting away of the physical form while focused on the online avatar. Addiction, not escapism.&&opposite of jumanji sequel where the hot girl turns into jack black&&He's out-of-shape in real life, until he moves and installs the exercise protocol on his account.&&Honestly it would have done a lot for setting the tone for the virtual world. Kind of disappointing.&&Maybe they'll make him skinny IRL and big and buffed out in the game.&&This is why it needed to be Christian Bale. He'd do some mechanic style weight loss between takes. &&They may put makeup or an appliance on her face for the Port Wine Stain (I think that's what the book was implying she had).&&This is really odd.  I distinctly remember her being described as ""svelte"" in the book at some point.  Yet Googling just now assures me she's 5'7"", 168 lbs, and has a ""Rubenesque"" physique.  So now I'm wondering why I distinctly remember the word svelte being used to describe her.

Edit: One of the things that stood out to Wade was the fact that Artemis looked exactly the same in-game vs out-of-game, just sans the birthmark.  So I don't think I confused her avatar's physique for her physique because they are supposed to be the same.  The question is why I remember her being described as svelte when everyone else (including the wiki) remembers her being described as Rubenesque.  It's possible the book said she ""wasn't svelte"" or something to that effect, and I missed a word.  But I can't confirm until I have the text in front of me.

Second Edit: Got home and flipped through my copy.  She is indeed never identified as svelte at any point.  Why my memory pulled a 180 I don't know.  Maybe I looked up the definition of Rubenesque and saw svelte listed as an antonym, and then my neurons got crossed.  I don't know.  Very odd.&&Well the birthmark was going to be something they would have to do with make up but yeah she doesn't really fit.&&Birthmarcus, Birthmartha, Birthmario, Birthmary and Birthmarlon &&literally unplayable. &&Actually that's more common than people think.  I've heard up to 90 percent of women have breast asymmetry but it's hardly noticeable. 

It would be a concern for her, but not something you could see on film or really in person unless you get her naked.  &&I always thought it was jerry&&Ace

Edit: Aech&&It's also a really big abandoned van&&I imagine they're going to change some things to allow for pleasing aestheticism. &&He became rich after finding the first key and upgraded everything.&&That's what I'm curious about as well. There's an early chapter where he just name drops dozens of movies, characters, etc. Also like you mentioned, WarGames and later on, Monty Python. 

Spielberg had already said (according to the trivia on IMDB) that he will be removing everything that references one of his movies, except for the Delorean. &&yeah but phones have massive crossover appeal. VR will have to make its sell to those not involved in gaming &&Huh? Do you really think there would be some old piece of nostalgia just laying around in a movie like this?

Edit: I don't know how I could possibly make it more obvious that I'm joking. &&like I said, I make mistakes like that daily. &&Ah, someone's probably going to have to reconstruct the QR code manually.. man, that is going to be a hassle, haha&&Enhance!&&There's way too much noise in the image, even tried sharpening/reducing noise in Lightroom/PS.&&wait...what??&&Or a car model from KIA?&&Big Black chicks? &&This is actually a brilliant idea. &&Lol, you joke, but the book actually didn't have a huge amount of Spielberg references. &&My only issue with it is that it regularly halts the narrative to dump exposition on nostalgia. Yes, Cline, I too watched those 80's movies. Let's go!&&It left me with the same taste that Sword Art Online did. Interesting concepts with dark undertones in the first half. And then it turned into a lame mushy love story in the second half.&&> which is tackled in the book in some interesting ways.

Like when a major corporation attacks some guests at a party and are fended off with magic lightning bolts from the host, then everyone just goes back to having fun?

I feel like the book doesn't *really* get into any of these deeper topics, it just creates an easy medium for others to discuss the topics. We can look at what happened in the ready player one world and then have our *own* discussions about it, but the book doesn't really do it.

And I can't imagine they'd find the time to create new material to do it in the movie while still maintaining the plot. I already think they're going to have to cut a lot of shit out.&&Fully agreed. I liked the book, don't get me wrong, but it also had its head firmly up its arse for a fair while.&&I mean, I don't think anyone has ever called it a literary writing masterpiece. It was some good nerd candy that was about it.&&The book was insufferable and I had to stop reading it after a few chapters. I was born in '82 and am a HUGE 80s junkie. I understood every single reference but it just felt overdone and cheesy in the book. Like he just wrote a list of every 80s thing he could think of and shoe-horned references in wherever he could. Nothing felt very thought out at all.&&Couldn't agree more. If you want a more in-depth discussion of the philosophies of virtual worlds (while still having an entertaining read), I highly recommend Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.&&It's interesting because I liked it quite a bit (as an audiobook in the car at least) but have only lowered my opinion on it since reading about it online. Most people seem to mercilessly trash it! And I can't say they're wrong. But I thought it was neat anyway. &&Here the thing, and this goes for Twilight as much as Ready, Player One:

Millions of people have enjoyed these books. These books gave them escapism, gave them emotions, gave them enjoyment. It doesn't really matter if they're bad. There is no magic Culture God giving you points for reading David Foster Wallace and taking them away for reading Dan Brown. We are not all in race to have read the best literature and be the most well-read. We are just living. Enjoy the media you consume. If you find it worthwhile to think about it critically too, that's awesome. If you just consume it to enjoy it, that's rad too.&&I'd say glamorized neck-beard, but yeah same difference.  For while in the book I thought that maybe I was supposed to hate him, and that it was leading somewhere.&&You guys are really putting me off this movie. &&One mans trash is another mans treasure, and sometimes playing in the dirt can be fun also. I loved it. It's no Count of Monte Cristo, but I loved it.
&&Ditto. It was basically like reading all of my childhood fantasies smashed together into a single plot line. On the upside, the piss poor writing has given me the confidence to try and write my own novel because if this shit could get published, why not my own idea?&&Yeah, it felt like it was a conscious decision by Cline to jam as many references in as possible to try and resonate with his target to the point that it became infuriating.  The book is completely overrated, the rest of the story-telling is average at best, that said, it will undoubtedly make a much better film because all the visuals that will be on show in front of you instead of having to wade through sloppy & poor writing to imagine them.&&Hey do you know every scene from War Games by heart

Great you are the most important person ever&&Meh, I'm in the core demographic and am/was into basically all the shit in it.  The book was fine, I just felt like I was being pandered to the whole time.&&I stopped reading Ready Player One after that one scene where he shows off in front of the whole club or whereever he is and all the ppl start CLAPPING because he is such a badass.
Kind of a surprise that Einstein didn't slip him a $100 dollar note afterwards.&&I stopped about 40% through because it was so much throwback and retro stuff all over again. It was like Cline had a bunch of stuff he couldn't shoehorn into RPO. Moreover, it had no real relevance to the story except to provide member berries.&&I was so excited about reading Armada, however so incredibly deflated after two or three chapters. Really expected so much more, such a disappointment. &&The parts where he reads the entire scoreboard made me crawl out if my skin&&I did the same.  After all the Reddit praise for this book, I tried the audiobook and had to bail after about 3 hours.  It struck me as an amateur writer's attempt to write a Snowcrash.  The way he shoehorned in all the 80s references was awful, broke immersion in the same way that a product placement does.&&Reading the book right now and yeah you're right. Though tbh it's not explained whether he's fat or just chubby. Since he was scaling the housing as well as using the bike to charge his stuff, he couldn't possibly have been super overweight. Also, [after he moves into the apartment, he's super fit after like 2 months? So he couldn't have been that big.](#spoiler) I did see mention of an XL shirt from his big days, but I don't know if that helps visualise anything.&&♫We're gonna need a mawntage! Montage!♫&&The van is gone by that point. He's living in that apartment with the uber OASIS rig.&&[When Parzival and Art3mis are talking about what they would do with the money they'd get from winning the contest, Parzival was very ""for himself"". As the story progressed and he began having a deeper connection with Art3mis, his stance on his winnings changed. It seemed he wanted to get humanity out of the horrid dystopian rut it was in, but he didn't seem to imply destroying OASIS in the end.](#spoiler)

If I wasn't focused on trying to finish up reading *Foundation*, I'd re-read Ready Player One. &&This is one of the main reasons I think they got Spielberg involved. Companies are a lot more likely to give rights to things when they have one of the greatest directors behind it. They know their product will be taken care of.&&The Lego Movie also had a lot of characters from different properties and that one was made by the same studio that is making Ready Player One&&seems pretty neat. I guess they have to spoil the dungeon though. maybe they wont' get the rights, but I'd bet WotC will sell out no matter what lol.&&That was close to 30 years ago.. Spielberg gets what he wants.&&He also wasn't the King of all movies back then.  
  
Though nowadays, there are companies hired specifically product placement.  They have relationships with the companies, and streamline the process considerably.  If it's a food company, the crew usually gets lots of snacks!&&Haven't read the book, so I don't understand the impact, but there's a good chance he'll throw in another name that will be either tongue-in-cheek or another influential director (possibly J.J.

I, in turn, wish that they will as well keep doing the same.&&Mine too. Holy fuck  balls!!!!&&1&&Actually the book said it was really cold within the stacks &&True. Gotta say though, I've got mixed feelings that they went in that direction. On the one hand, getting sucked into a game to me isn't nearly as interesting as a game coming out into real life. But on the other, it's an interesting way to explore the ""from childhood to adulthood and back again"" aspect of the original in a different way&&He was eating gov't mandated crap food.

[Why the Risk of Obesity is Greater for the Poor](http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/why-poverty-leads-obesity-and-life-long-problems)

Eating right and engaging in regular physical activity are decisions all individuals in America can make to lower the risk of obesity and associated health problems. But of course the choices made by children and adolescents are strongly affected by the family and community environments in which they live. Impoverished living conditions matter especially for the young, because they throw up many barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors.

**Poor families have limited food budgets and choices**, and must often stretch supplies toward the end of the month, before another check or allocation of Food Stamps arrives. This leads to unhealthy behaviors in several ways:

* Families choose high-fat foods dense with energy – foods such as sugars, cereals, potatoes and processed meat products – because these foods are more affordable and last longer than fresh vegetables and fruits and lean meats and fish. 

* Poor families often live in disadvantaged neighborhoods where healthy foods are hard to find. Instead of large supermarkets, poor neighborhoods have a disproportionate number of fast food chains and small food stores providing cheap, high-fat foods.

* Economic insecurity – such as trouble paying bills or rent – leads to stress, and people often cope by eating high-fat, sugary foods. 

**Options for regular physical activity can also be restricted for poor people**:

* Families cannot usually afford to pay for organized children’s activities outside of school – and schools in impoverished areas are less likely to run sports or physical activity programs than schools with more resources. 

* Due to inflexible work schedules, lack of transportation, or unmet needs for child care, poor parents, especially single mothers, may find it hard to support extra activities for their children. Leaving kids in front of the TV is often all stressed poor parents can manage.

* In many poor neighborhoods, parks, playgrounds, trails, and free public gyms are often not available or safe. Neighborhoods may be crime-ridden, and there may be no nearby indoor places for play or exercise. Ironically, parental efforts to keep kids safe and indoors may increase encourage sedentary behaviors such as watching TV and playing video games.&&From what I can remember, he doesn't get severely out of shape until he's halfway through the hunt, hiding from the bad guys, refusing to go outside, getting things delivered to his hotel room in the real world. He decides later that it's an awful lifestyle and that he'll eventually have to go physically SEE the bad guys so he gets back into shape with the exercise expansions. &&Or exactly like the Jumanji sequel, where the ""Hollywood plain"" girl turns into Karen Gillan and the nerdy guy turns into The Rock.&&I've heard that the actors don't know what their virtual avatars look like, which is intriguing&&I read the book yesterday.

Edit : i get it. I was mistaken. Rubenesque still stands&&The upper end of the ideal weight

It's not a common thing in blockbusters and some of their scenes rely on that feeling of OMG is he gonna do it, and even movies where it could be done it's not (it feels like it's avoided because the OMG what if... feeling can be done rather easily and safely).&&I don't know if you read the book, but in this world the majority of the world uses VR headsets to enter a virtual world called the Oasis.

Completing *that* provided another URL which went live weeks later, and so on and so forth.

Abd this is who Matthew Broderick &&Yes, and literally every problem was solved with a perfect memory for 80s culture. It was like a cyberpunk Encyclopedia Brown.  &&It worked great in the context of this story. His next book, Armada, was just WAY TOO MUCH of that stuff when it didn't have any reason to be in there. I didn't even want to finish it because it was so over-the-top and cutesy. &&I wouldn't even have a problem with the love story if it weren't so blatantly wish fulfillment. It's like he read a summary of a manic pixie dream girl and thought ""yeah, that's exactly what I want!""&&Reddit loves that kind of book though. RP1 has just replaced ""John Dies At The End,"" and that Worms book, and the massive ""What if Harry Potter was written as an author insert by a glib sociopath with smugly Harrisian views and minimal scientific literacy"" fanfic, as Reddit's ""You just gotta read this"" recommendations.

To be fair John Dies At The End is a fun read at 1 am with the lights off. But it needed an editor (then again, so did Deathly Hallows...). Worms is interminable and HPMOR is insufferable. 

The two books that Reddit disproportionately loves that I agree are great books, are Holes and Hatchet.&&I could just never buy that this one twerp was able to almost single-handedly solve this not-all-that-complicated three-step mystery that apparently had dumbfounded the *entire fucking world* for... what, ten years? I forget.

I could maybe buy that he individually solves the first puzzle, sure, but why has this mysterious genius made a three-step puzzle where the first step fools the planet for a decade, and then the second and third steps are so obvious that apparently everyone can figure them out in a couple of days?

I just didn't enjoy the book. It felt like Twilight for classic-video-game nerds. Plothole and contrivances galore, unlikeable characters, endless dalliances on what you can tell the author is particularly obsessed with. Nerd wish fulfillment.&&Or Diamond Age. Snow Crash hasn't aged particularly well, even though it was prescient in some ways.&&That's all well and good, but I draw the line when people try to rank it among the greatest things ever written. Really, you wanna stick this motherfucker in the classics section along with Tolstoy and Shakespeare? I find it difficult to hold my tongue in that situation. Although to be fair, I've only seen one comment in this thread making such a claim. &&Ugh he was a glamorized neck beard. I liked this book but he did annoy the shit out of me sometimes.&&and then he completely unironically ends up with the Manic Pixie Dream Girl at the end.&&Just think twilight for the reddit demographic. Plot is dumb and characters are toxic but its junk food reading that makes some people feel good. At the end of the day it entertained people and you cant take that away from them.&&EXACTLY! 

Asshole deserved to have his company taken over by a heartless corporation. 

&&>The book was fine, I just felt like I was being pandered to the whole time.

I think that's 100% the problem though. The story, as painfully derivative as it is, is serviceable. Even with the characters being pretty two dimensional, I enjoyed the plot enough to keep going.

But there's just *SO MUCH* hamfisted nostalgia. The game's music is done by John Williams; Carl Sagan was the face of the video; everything is a Star Trek or Wars or Ender's Game reference... we get it Cline, you like sci-fi.&&That scene reminded me of the Spiderman 3 club scene. There are better ways to show the protagonist is being a narcissist and an asshole without making the whole scene just super cringy && The whole time I was like ""Man don't just fucking tell me this shit. Tell the story in such a way that we learn all this setting and backstory stuff organically. ""&&Spielberg being executive producer on Who Framed Roger Rabbit helped make that work better than anyone could have hoped.&&And HUGE TOY SALES!&&i think Lego already had the rights to those properties though&&Honestly I think getting Spielberg attached to this was the best way to get the rights for so many franchises. There's still no telling what makes it and what doesn't but [the part with the Tomb of Horrors is something that really can't be cut... sure they can rewrite it to be something else but one of the main tasks are completed here.](#spoiler)

I also thought about this reading it the second time around. The first time I wasn't aware they were making a movie, but after going back realizing how many references there are... either it's going to be jam-packed with nostalgia or there's gonna be A LOT of content getting the axe.&&As long as he doesn't want an E.T. game that's fun to play.
&&[deleted]&&If anything, M&M's turning him down for E.T. taught companies to never make that mistake. &&I think that was his whole point. M&M doubted the power of the product placement and paid for it. It's unlikely anyone will hold out in him especially considering how popular he has become in the last 30 years. &&Ayy mine too! &&Juan&&> On the one hand, getting sucked into a game to me isn't nearly as interesting as a game coming out into real life.

That's pretty much my problem with the new one. I don't care that it's now a video game instead of a board game (although I really don't think it was a necessary change). But the fun of the original was the game world coming into the real world. Getting sucked into the game just looks like it's going to be a bunch of crazy hijinks in the jungle.&&[deleted]&&That's exactly what happens in the real world. That's why poor people are fat because all they can afford are fast food and soft drinks.&&Wait Oasis is going to be some CG world? &&Absolutely.

Non-book-readers, minor spoiler here)


They've only cast Aech with one actor. From what I can see, they're just throwing out act 1+2 Aech and making them act 3 Aech for the whole movie.

For that matter, they really should have put Wade in a fat suit for the IRL sequences before act 2. Him actually starting to give a shit about himself is some pretty major character development.&&May wana put that in a spoiler tag yo.&&I also wonder where all the light is coming in from if the van is supposed to be buried in essentially a junk heap...&&I mean, they definitely mentioned that there was a riding bike in it to charge batteries.&&I don't disagree with you, I'm just pointing out how movie makers think. &&Joust, Zork II, Adventure, Tempest and a few others.

Here's a really [cool list](http://www.shmoop.com/ready-player-one/allusions.html) of every reference that appears in the book. It will be truly interesting to see what gets left off and how it will affect the plot.

&&This is what I was going to say. EVERYONE owns a headset.&&The newspaper article is from decades before the events of the movie. Note that the headline is announcing the release of Oasis. Like you said, by the time of the movie, Oasis is ubiquitous, but apparently ""over 20 million"" headsets were sold between 2021 and the release of Oasis.&&You guys are missing one thing... news article says Oasis is being released... VR is mentioned to be small before Oasis. 20 million is pretty small. Oasis is released in that article and I'm sure it shot up. 

IMO the article is canon with the book &&man you a real gunter now&&This is what I got: https://i.imgur.com/bGfjZXd.png Might want to compare it with yours and merge/blend. (Mine doesn't work... Really annoying to get from that potato quality especially the parts with very little black)

A thought that I had was to generate similar looking QR codes and to automatically check if it's a valid code that produces a valid URL. But it's late and I'm tired so I'm not going to write any code until I've slept. So if nobody has gotten it in 10h hours or so then I'm going to start with that.&&Holy hell, that's amazing. I had no idea! Are there any pictures of the DeLorean?&&And as a lover of some of those things, it was frustrating that the references themselves were so surface level - nothing was really a true *love letter* to the thing being described in any circumstance, there was no attempt to express the experience of any of the things referenced, just the bare Wikipedia-worthy facts of them. You could easily swap the name ""Pac Man"" out for ""Pong"" or ""War Games"" out for ""Top Gun"" without changing those sections of the novel hardly at all. 

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we'll see a lot of the 80s references swapped around in the movie adaptation for stuff that could more easily be licensed. And nothing substantive will be lost, because those references are stickers on a lunchbox - decorative, not functional. &&Yeah, what I hated the most was ""literally recite the movie from your memory"" missions. A) Who would be able to do that? I get famous quotes quiz, but literally every line of a character? Seems a bit unrealistic. B) Where the fun in that? For the player, for the reader, for the watcher? Who wants that?&&I mean, the plot did set that up though. 

The whole point of the scavenger hunt is that the guy who created it was obsessed with 80s culture. It makes sense that his clues would be solved through knowledge of 80s culture... &&This is my beef with the book. The character is able to perfectly recall every single minute detail of 80's geekdom at a whim. Totally took me out of every scenario he was in whenever he did that. And just saying he studied a lot of 80's stuff doesn't make it ok, dude is not a robot. &&Armada felt super short. Where RPO felt like an entire season of a TV show, Armada felt like the first 3 episodes of one. It seemed very phoned in. He'd describe how each game worked, but then none of the game jargon ever really became relavent to the story. 

The ""romance"" was literally a joke. I honestly couldn't believe he was taking the easiest road to get those two together. By the end when he's describing their first few dates, he rushed through months of 'plot'  in about 3 sentences.

The most interesting part of the whole book to me was his father's fucked up mental state. When he was reading all those letters and you saw how staying on the moon really took a toll on him I actually started to get a bit invested, but even that was fairly short lived.

I honestly couldn't believe how 2nd rate this book felt in comparison to RPO. It seems as if he had years to work on RPO and then because of it's success, he was given like a summer to write Armada. Disappointed.&&HAHA! This is absurdly accurate.&&that was the perfect description of Harry Potter methods of rationality&&And then this nerdy fat kid who spends all his time watching 80s movies and sitcoms becomes a super hacker and breaks into the biggest company in the world and is super cool and stuff! 

Edit - oh and then he becomes the richest man in the world because he outsmarted the evil corporation, and he wins over his super-crush cuz he's such a nice guy and everything. Also he has muscles now. The. End.&&It's been a while since I read it, but I remember at one point his avatar goes to a party in a (insert famous sci-fi movie) vehicle like the Delorean or Ghostbusters car or some shit. 

It was about that time I realized Ernest Cline was most likely a neckbeard just trying to write a book where he fistfucked as many 70s and 80s nerd references into a story and hope for the best.

The story itself isn't bad, I did enjoy reading it, but it's like he just started writing down references and lucked out into a halfway decent story, you know?&&Yep, poster child for needing the ""show me don't tell me"" advice for writers &&Toy rights and movie rights are not the same thing.&&>I also thought about this reading it the second time around.

Try the Audio book version! I binged it because it was so enthralling.&&solid burn. truth. &&Same here!&&Now kith.&&I think getting sucked in to the game was a good move. We already got to see what happens when the game comes to life but now we get to see what it's like being in there like Alan was. I do wish they would have stuck with the board game though.&&Yes, exactly. The perfect recipe for getting fat. I wonder how they'll handle the second act where he's hairless, pale, and buff?&&Well.. Considering the book, i would have liked for him to be chubby, not necessarily fat. 
BUT! They did add his bike and the heater he uses. And considering the importance of the heater in the winters. I can excuse him not being overweight... But still.. Typical Hollywood: ""Ohh no, I'm so poor, look at my worn Converse and fitting clothes""&&[deleted]&&[There was a story about a study published a couple days ago](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/12/health/poor-americans-fast-food-partner/index.html) saying that poor people are not eating fast food the most. Basically everyone eats fast food but middle class eat a little more of it.&&And they often live in food deserts, where fruits and vegetables are expensive as hell.&&Wait, water is cheaper than soda.&&Healthy food is actually cheaper when you keep it down to basics but it requires more time/energy to prepare and cooking 'aptitude', which sadly too many people lack altogether. &&They're fat because they eat too many calories. People are ALWAYS fat because they eat too many calories. Some people seem to think that no matter how little you eat, you'll always get fat from cheeseburgers and soft drinks. Or you can somehow have a biochemical problem that magically produces fat ""no matter how little I eat"". It's completely irrational. 

The question is why people eat too many calories and THAT'S a much more interesting question that rarely gets asked. Grossly overweight people have appetite control out of wack, and the reasons for that aren't completely known.

As an aside, that's why ""naturally thin"" people can't understand why fat people won't ""just stop eating."" If you're rarely hungry or your hunger pangs aren't bad, it's easy to maintain a healthy weight. If your hunger pangs are out of control and your brain constantly tortures you with images of food because it believes itself starving, it's much harder.&&Yeah Im puzzled by this... unless they are portrayed by a different actor?&&So her face is stained with actual port wine?

Bit of a meaningless explanation in the audiobook I imagine.  :P&&Same here, had to go check the spelling of everything after.&&Same here. It took about 15 readings of the cast list to find Aech. Although, Wil Wheaton did a hell of a job for the reading.&&Yeah I saw who they cast as Aech yesterday and got really sad. I really hope they don't do what you said and just completely ignore the progression of the character, but even if they don't do that, it's still the ""hollywood"" casting of the character that's very specifically supposed to be a certain way.&&Huh. That would be a ridiculously massive change.&&[DeLorean Giveaway](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/800x450/format/jpg/quality/85/http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2012/09/ready-player-one-giveaway-628.jpg)&&The fact that the entire story is set up for it doesn't make it any less dumb, or repetitive and unsatisfying to read.

Edit- words&&Where does it say that he got buff?  I thought he was fat the entire way through the book, but he just shaved his body hair to fit into the suit.  From what I remember he still didn't leave his place and the only exercise he got was with his doll. 

Edit: Nevermind, just looked up the passage myself.  It states that he gets a flatter stomach and more muscular frame.  &&The van is too big and fancy, the kid is too thin, the kids clothes are too well fitting and the kid is too clean.&&So like a Jonah Hill chubby?&&[deleted]&&Would agree with that. When I was poor as fuck I ate mostly spaghetti Os and Ramen for lunch with one or two days a week of fast food because I could barely afford it. Sometimes scraping together change for some dollar menu items. 

Now I am doing much better for myself I eat at Chik Fila or Taco Bell pretty often for lunch. Fast food 5 days a week, although I try for smaller healthier optiond. I understand it is not healthy, but it is delicious, convenient, and I can easily afford it. &&More accurately, sugar is addictive and cheap.&&>why people eat too many calories

At a certain point, it's simply being addicted to food.

Easily develops from forming a habit of ""entertaining"" yourself with food, and spirals out of control if you lack self-control, or if you're suffering from severe depression or something along those lines.

I imagine that people who are 300lbs+ develop a ""I'll never be thin anyway"" and eat even more with no regrets.&&A balanced diet does have an indirect link to weight loss. Namely if you take in a healthy amount of fiber, get a lot more calories from slower burning fats and proteins. It all has to do with controlling hunger though.

Unfortunately many people don't understand basic calories in vs. calories out. You can literally lie down all day and lose weight if you eat less than your daily caloric expenditure.&&“Jerry up!” From Battlefield 1 makes a lot more sense now. &&I think we all know a Jerry. &&TBH, listening to the audiobook before having read it, I was dead certain that Aech was Halliday, because of the obvious pronunciation that wouldn't have been as clearly telegraphed in written form.&&I listened to Insomnia by Stephen King last week and also got the Kindle book.

There was one time where the reader said something like ""The sign said 'Choose', but the 'O's were replaced with the women's sign."" I checked the text, and it just had the word written with those symbols. But the reader had to add the line explaining it, or else it wouldn't have made sense.&&It does. It was nice to know it was spelled weird though. 

On a side note, the scoreboard segments in the audiobook were painful. &&Wil Wheaton was fantastic. I've listened to a lot of audio books and he was easily one of my favourites. &&I listened to it too - I imagined /u/wil  might have had to have a go or two at the part where he read his own name, that he was vice president of Oasis, and that he kicked ass at protecting user rights :). As it was, I liked to think I could detect a smile as he read it. &&Did the guy who won show up dressed as Marty McFly?&&I agree. I really, really wanted to like this book but the writing felt like Twilight. I try to finish most books I get a handful of pages into, but this was a slog simply because it was so poorly written. The concept was great but the execution was horrible IMO.&&Or maybe you're depriving the world of the greatest marshmallow fiction since Ghostbusters ?&&Also, I would say ""80s culture"" is different than ""memorizing the script of every single movie and TV show from the 80s"".   
A good riddle is one where you see the answer and go, ""Of course! Why didn't I think of that! It's so simple!"".

the exit doors of the place were questionable at best, and people would routinely pry them open and sneak in so they didnt have to pay. one day someone found in the back of one of the screens what looked like  that a homeless person was living there. no one ever saw anyone and no evidence was ever found again that there was someone living in the theater, but it didnt stop people from swearing them heard something late at night while cleaning up.

 me and my friend and co manager named this homeless entity ""ninja bum"", as no one ever actually saw him but swore he existed. i took a large popcorn bucket, cut 2 eyeholes in it, and took a broom stick as a staff, and had my friend take a picture of me. then we made a copy of it and hung it in the office that said ""WANTED: Ninja Bum. REWARD. have you seen me?

anytime new people would be hired i would say ""watch out for ninja bum when you clean up tonight."" some people refused to clean theaters alone because of ninja bum. sometimes people would run out of the theaters and swear someone was in there. ""IM NOT JOKING THAT NINJA BUM THING IS REAL MAN!!"" they would say, or something similar. then every time  id go in there with them and shine a flashlight and.....nothing. ninja bum strikes again.

that theater has since been torn down and a gym put in its place. i miss ninja bum. id like to think hes still out there, hiding in the new gym, his new home. take care ninja bum, wherever you are.&&That's pretty amazing but I assume this is for giant screens? The screens where I'm from are rarely more than 15ft across&&The Mugar Omni Theater in the Boston Museum of Science does a pre show which shows all the scaffolding and speakers lit up as they activate them.

Wrong. I literally just finished Inglorious Basterds and all that's behind a movie theater screen is fire and Jewish vengeance. &&OP this is way late but I worked at a staffer to Assistant Manager at a theater chain for 7 years. I've installed theaters, screens, speakers, ATMOS digital, etc if you have any questions you didn't get answered here.

I didn't work a lot with 35mm, only ever threaded 2 movies and I was under supervision still when I did it. Never was trained to work on 70mm IMAX, but I've seen the equipment and know a little, we went to digital IMAX which was interesting.&&Here's more info.

Not it's no big deal, imax is everywhere &&Always wondered what was behind the screen, and now I know. Thanks, OP!&&So, when I was 17 I worked as some sort of maintenance guy at a 4 screen movie house. I had a no experience at all, barely mowed my own lawn. I was in charge of watering the bushes out of front, changing the damn movie names by the street sign, replacing lights on the seating tracks... Etc. One day they gave me the task of removing gummy bears from the $$$creeens, yes, Assholes would lick em and flick em all over the screen. It was the worst job because of the fact that they  just harped on the fact that I shouldn't rip the screen as it would be very costly to repair. Well, I ripped one. I climbed down the ladder, walked out of the building, and ran as fast as I could. Fuck gummy bears.&&I had no idea that those screens were acoustically transparent. So cool.&&Fake.

I guess it was fall and some homeless people had set up a secret camp in a different theater in our chain&&Funny. When I was working in a cinema, what I found behind the screen were a couple fucking. Guess it depends where you're from.&&So you also banged someone behind it and it was like everyone was watching?&&When I was 4, I went with my family to watch the first Ice Age movie. I wanted to enter the movie and I believed I could do so by entering the tiny curtain below the screen. So when my parents weren't looking, I convinced my little sister to come along with me so we could enter the movie and talk to the characters.

I was extremely disappointed to find out the curtain led to just a tiny room and not the universe of Ice Age, and my crawling around in front of and underneath the screen probably annoyed everyone watching the movie. Got in big trouble.&&Is it practical for sound to travel through the screen?  (I'm sure this is the norm, but still)&&Cool! Why does this have more comments than likes?&&That is effing rad! Makes me wish every theater would show off the speakers before the movie.&&This is perfect for mildlyinteresting. &&[deleted]&&Huh, I'd think all those speakers would cause the screen to shake noticeably...&&There's a sub called /r/employeesonly that would love stuff like this. I'd xpost, but on mobile. &&Huh. I always thought the speakers were on the sides somewhere. No idea they were behind the screen.&&One time my friend and I were the only people in the movie theater. We sat on opposite ends of the theater and yelled to each other the whole time. Then I chucked my shoe at Adam Sandler's big ugly head and it ripped a hole in the screen. I still don't know how I got away with that.&&Thank you!  I've always wondered!&&yay &&I'm surprised we don't see the screen vibrate if their are all those speakers behind it&&I love this post - thanks for showing this. &&Let me guess. Fire proofing?

&& You're not fooling me,  I saw Gremlins.&&I used to work at a movie theatre and I knew a couple that would go back behind the screen and get it on mid-movie clocked in 😀&&But where do the Unicorns go?&&I thought it was concrete... &&People don't realize how important the center channel is in film. Look a how many speakers playing just center there are!&&I have a friend who worked at a movie theatre and you know the curtains at the bottom of the screen? They can store stuff there. Apparently one of her coworkers found a hobo living there... &&Wait... You mean it's not a small version of the arctic with fans equipped to blow at maximum capacity 24/7?&&Possible dummy question here: What are the microphone looking things that are sticking out from the wall at about 40 degrees from vertical? There are ~ 50 of them pictured. Do they hold up the screen? &&Pretty sure every theatre I've ever been to has the centre speaker from a laptop for all the speaking parts and military sound cannons for the effects volume. You're clearly showing what cinemas of the future could have. Apparently you'll be able to hear what the actors are saying during action scenes soon! &&I've always wondered! Tfs!&&How do those big ass speakers produce..... picture???&&http://imgur.com/gallery/Ov65x&&I wanna know what lurks behind your fly 😘&&This reminds me of a supposedly very very haunted movie theatre I went to in Scotland. I did not know it was haunted when I went. But I tell you. It's the one thing that's made me even slightly believe in ghosts. I heard whispers. Felt like there was someone sat behind me even tho there wasn't. Felt physically cold after sitting down. After I left I was discussing with a local cafe owner that I had just watch a film there and her happy face went clear a fearful really fast. She told me that there were several alleged suicides at the theatre. I say alleged because the locals believe that they weren't suicides. Anyway. I exactly a Year after the 'suicides' during a movie the screen tore all the way down the middle. The next day the staff all quit because they said the place was already creepy with voices and chills and random weird shit like seats in the down position when they are spring loaded to go up. Shit like that. Ever since then it has been understaffed and run by the owners who according to the cafe lady are scared shitless. She had spoken to people who were at the theatre when the screen tore and they all said the night was super fucking creepy even before it happened. 

I spoke to my dad later that day and he confirmed the story. Scary fucking shit. &&Always pictured the speakers to be more centered and horizontal like a home theater center channel speaker. &&Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 50) with your post!

They apply a very small amount of pressure to the back side of the screen, and vibrate.

Their purpose is to de-speckle the light coming from the laser projector. The vibration movement isn't visible to the viewer, but it does move the screen surface enough to reduce the speckle that your eye perceives.

These shakers aren't needed in xenon based projection systems.

Edit: spelling

It's so funny.&&You should talk about the lasers installed in the projection booth replacing bulb tech.&&Front speakers have been placed behind cinema screen even before Dolby Atmos and it has been this way for decades. If you ever get the chance to walk right up to a screen even in a cinema not equipped with Dolby Atmos and shine a light at the screen when a movie's not playing you'll see the speakers. &&I believe you are incorrect. The front speakers are part of the base LCR system (part of 5.1 maybe 7.1).  Dolby Atmos is an additional speaker effect system that is installed on the ceiling and comes in multiples of 4 channels (4,8,16,24, etc).  These are specifically JBL Cinema Series speakers.&&Not really. Most movie theaters have speakers behind the screens. Those aren't the Dolby atoms speakers.  Not the right type. I go to one frequently to know. &&Question: how do they keep the screen from vibrating?&&The sound isn't muffled behind the screen ?&&Right. The screen does shake. But since the picture is projected it doesn't shake.&&The fabric is usually tightened, kind of like a trampoline &&It can, but doesn't for a few reasons.

The screen is perforated to let the sound through in the first place. It is also stretched tightly, even perforated drop down home theater screens are pretty tight.

High and mid frequency drivers, which are what's shown in the picture, don't move the same volume of air as subwoofers so won't shake the screen nearly as much. I don't know where the subs are placed in commercial theaters, but in home projection theaters the are usually not behind the screen. Low frequency sound is much less directional, so you don't have to have subwoofers everywhere you have speakers.&&Well even if the speakers aren't behind the screen its not like there wouldn't be sound waves there.&&I remember ~~15~~ *20* years or so ago when I first learned that the main front speakers in the cinema were *behind the screen*.  My mind was completely blown.  Turns out the screen is basically also a speaker grille.

It was when I saw Star Wars: Special Edition and it was in a theatre so small you could see the grille pattern on the screen and the little holes.

Example: https://i.imgur.com/dKys4Tq.jpg

The bottom right one is how cinema screens always used to look for most of my life.  The other three are ones they sometimes use with newer digital projectors.  They're still designed to allow clear transmission of sound through the screen.&&You can do it for a fixed reference point but the seats in a movie theater are spread throughout so this works better. If you have a pair of well-matched reference speakers positioned and angled correctly from the sides of the screen and symmetrical about the screen's axis, you'll hear the sound coming from the center of the screen or shifted based on how the sound is panned. This is one of the most common setups for mixing/mastering audio in stereo.&&No need to make him feel dumb&&You can make something sound like it's coming from straight ahead with only a left and right speaker. Yes, you have to sit right between them for it to work, but it's possible&&True- though in the 90s AMC messed around with this.  They wanted to install Torus screens in their biggest auditoriums, which were curved top to bottom as well as left to right to eliminate the ""hot spot"" and allegedly provide better light/focus- and the only way for that to work was to use a solid screen with a vacuum pump in the center.

But a solid screen means no holes for sound to get through, so AMC put the left, right, and center channel speakers above the screen angled down at the audience.  Mostly wasn't really noticeable, but if you sat in the front it was real hard to hear anything and in general everything had a boomy echo.

These are still in place- if your AMC is a 24 or 30 Plex built anytime in the late 1990s or very early 2000s (as most 24s and 30s were), any of the big houses in the middle by the concessions stands that weren't converted to IMAX, ETX, or AMC Prime/Dolby Cinema are likely still using this same setup last I checked.&&My computer speakers are on the left and right of 3 monitors and it still sounds like the sound is coming out of the middle. Never really thought that a movie theater would be any different.&&>how else would you make it sound like an onscreen voice is coming from straight ahead 

Clever reflection of sound, or using multiple speakers in a phased array like setup. &&You got a problem with his big meaty claws?&&Why?  Your right shoulder doesn't move freely to your back?&&What the fuck&&Only because his torso is facing the camera. If it were correctly facing the screen it'd look normal, like his head is turned, which is the intention. &&Where are the rest of them?&&I ended up just pulling the episode up and taking this one.&&S01E10B, F.U.N.&&Dear diary. Today OP was a good guy&&Didn't expect that, good man!&&TIL&&I really like the Dolby Cinema experience they've built out.

Source: [[link]](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/34xtj7/heres_what_the_space_behind_a_movie_theater/cqz34wh/)&&Ok but what's behind THAT?&&they probably damp the screen from speaker vibrations&&-------E

So, it's a repost..... &&I was in an imax dome once and they definitely just backlit it. It was cool because even though it was only tiny holes, you could see all the equipment.&&Pretty sure it was backlit. From memory the speakers looked too realistic to be a simulation and the wiki page says flat screens could be backlit to show the speakers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX#Dome_and_OMNIMAX&&An acoustically transparent screen doesnt have to be expensive.  I built my 140"" for about 150 total.  Poplar wood, two layers of spandex and the key, screen channeling from home Depot.  Grab a used or new benq and a shitty home theater in a box and you have a theater room for 1000-1500&&I finally decided to make one last year. 180"" of Dolby Atmos surround sound is pretty sweet. My projector is the LG ultra short throw projector so you can walk around without blocking the picture.&&1. These days, it's a lot of sitting around at a computer and managing the content. We usually receive films on physical hard drives in a [CRU housing] (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images1000x1000/cru_dataport_6601_7100_0500_data_express_dx115_dc_1057892.jpg), and put that in a slot to ingest (download) the Feature to our main library. We can also download them from directly from the distributor or Deluxe/Technicolor (they used to be the main two, until they merged and now they distribute like 95% of films in US). From the library server, we push the Features to each projector as necessary. Each projector is equipped with a RAID-array set of hard drives to store the 100GB-300GB Features and all the necessary Trailers (usually about ~2-3GB each). Most theaters and chains are running a scheduled setup, but the one I'm at now has a projectionist on the clock at all times, and we do all of our starts manually.

2. Get to? I get *paid* to. Each film we open on Fridays gets a tech-screening by one of our projectionists, usually on Wednesday nights. I definitely prefer having the theater to myself. I also get free passes to any non-sold-out film, as well as passes to any Landmark, Regal/United Artists, and Alamo Drafthouse theaters.

3. I've never had to deal with a [brain wrap] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hxG8FnBTv3U/R2rsL2SDvLI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/_-p-rsPV47E/s400/Brainwrap.jpg) first-hand, but I've heard a ton of horror stories. We still run 35mm prints occasionally, but we do it on a 2-projector reel-to-reel setup, like [this one] (http://lnl.wpi.edu/assets/img/projection/1.jpg), which is safer for the print itself, but requires a projectionist to run it.   
First-hand, we were playing SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN and the one of the sprockets was broken, and it got caught in the gate of the projector (where the light comes through and the film passes by) and [melted Kristen Stewart's face] (http://i.imgur.com/UcDQ9Ae.jpg). I was also watching INTERSTELLAR on 70mm IMAX (not at a theater I worked at), and the print got a brain wrap about 45 minutes into it. Management told us what happened and that we would get free passes at the end, but that we were welcome to leave and get a full refund. I stayed. It took about a half hour to get up and going again, and then about 45 minutes from the end, it happened again. By this point it was already past 1am and management straight up said ""it's not going to be back on tonight, sorry"" and I got 3 free IMAX passes for it. So that's nice.

4. I don't have any pictures of the booth I've worked in on-hand, but I can probably take some next time I'm in.

Edit: Hello fellow Iowan!&&I remember when IMAX was new and 3D movies only had selected scenes in 3D. My mom took us to the only IMAX theater in our state to see Prisoner of Azkaban. I loved the books, and it was a tradition for her to take me and my brother to see the movies as they came out since that was usually around my birthday. The theater would play an intro to IMAX, with that ""this is what a tornado sounds like"" feature. I was also a weird storm chaser lover, so I would close my eyes and try and imagine being in a tornado.&&Boston Museum of Science has been doing that for as long I can remember (late 80's , early 90's?).
Extra bonus is that it's Leonard Nimoy that did all the vocals. &&Where are they doing this, and why isn't my local theater replicating it. &&Ahh mine doesn't! I went to one in Toronto once and they did that it was so cool&&I miss you Iowa&&Hello fellow Iowan!&&I used to live in West Des Moines, and the science center/ skywalk downtown was absolutely my favorite place to go. I watched a show about Ancient Greece and their mythology that changed my life for the next couple years, getting me almost scarily knowledgeable about Greek myths. And there's a planetarium where you just lie flat on the ground and look up at the screen like the night sky, which got me scarily into astronomy. Basically that place shaped my major interests for a long time, and remains in my 8 Wonders of My World list.&&The IMAX I used to go to had the same thing but they had a prop skeleton and other decorations next to the speakers. It was a small detail but it was cool to see him every time we went. &&They do it in the sphere IMAX at the Liberty Science Center, too&&Great Lakes Science Center does this as well!

You are more traditionally correct though.&&I thought he was wrong too (for different reasons) so I looked in to it. [This is the original reddit post from 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/34xtj7/heres_what_the_space_behind_a_movie_theater/?ref=share&ref_source=link). If true, [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8373533/dolby-cinema-amc-prime-movie-theater-laser-projector) states it is in fact one of the first Dolby Atmos systems in the country. Also, [the white paper for Dolby Atmos](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-atmos/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf) in movie theaters basically illustrates this exact setup on page 2. They could certainly be JBL speakers though.&&Actually they *intentionally* vibrate the screen now! The new laser projection systems have an unfortunate side effect known as laser speckling, and one of the ways to break up this visual pattern is to vibrate the screen constantly. I even came across the equipment sitting [in the lobby of an AMC once and was overly excited that I knew what it was.](http://imgur.com/a/RXTi3)&&No, the screen is specifically perforated (or woven) so it has tiny holes in it to let the sound through.&&So slightly in and out of focus but not enough for us to notice then? &&True. If the sound didn't come from there, it'd echo from there and ruin the sound.&&There used to be an IMAX theatre near me that had a really cool intro that they showed before every movie. Part of the intro included shining lights on the speakers, including the ones behind the screen. It blew my mind the first time I saw it.&&Well his claws just aren't for attractin' mates&&You're the hero Reddit deserves, mate&&Ah good move. Love how much spongebob gets referenced these days&&Very nice username&&Only because he didn’t want downvotes&&Not with Dolby Cinema. 
Every other theater is lacking after that. You're talking to someone who has tried everything from 4D to IMAX to Alamo Drafthouse. And I exclusively only go to Dolby Cinema anymore, it's my favorite way to watch a movie. 

I'm super picky when it comes to theaters anymore. Hate theater seating. Only like recliners. Only like reserved seating. 
As much as I love the lineup at Alamo Drafthouse, I hate the idea of eating a meal while watching a movie. I hate seeing people walking throughout the theater. The screens are small. And sound is meh. And I hate the theater seats. I'm 6'4"" and those seats are made for dwarves. 

I only go to AMC anymore, and I go to the movies twice a week at least. I don't use any of their normal venues, only what's showing in Dolby Cinema. 

So I wouldn't call AMC garbage. Which is the only way to experience Dolby Cinema. Which is cheap too it's only $9 for me, since I only like morning shows.  Hate people. 

Edwards is garbage. United artists is garbage. Alamo Drafthouse, though I like their lineup I don't like theaters where you eat. Popcorn and a soda is all I want to hear. Cinemarks recliners are nice, but lacking but #2 in my book, their Dbox seats are cool but a gimmick in my opinion. And AMC red recliners are okay, but sound is lacking, and AMC IMAX are a lie, but they come out ahead because of Dolby Cinema. 
Regular theaters are like McDonald's hamburgers anymore, good and hit the spot. But Dolby Cinema is like a rare Prime rib that's perfectly marbled, for the same price as that hamburger! You can't go back after that. I just can't. I won't. &&Ok, that makes sense.  The default image came zoomed so I couldn't see the seats.  I was wondering why the screen was curved the opposite way (thinking that we were looking at the back).&&Ooohh. I see it now. I thought this was behind the screen.&&[deleted]&&Turtles all the way down.&&Tesseract &&I'm sad that ""your mom"" wasn't the reply here.

You mean when an entire industry decided to prioritize power consumption, thinness and brightness over image quality? Yeah, I remember. The period in between the disappearance of Plasmas and the affordability of OLED should be called the fucking dark age of television&&How's the power consumption on those things?

I'm thinking I'd like to get a projector for my next computer ""screen"", so I can sit my desk a nice distance from it while still being able to read the text, but the wattage seems a bit high compared to a regular computer monitor.&&They actually cause it to implode, but very violently.&&I've worked with a couple of Christie Roadie HD+35K projectors, and the process for getting the lamps in there was intense (gloves + mask + safety jacket).

That and the moment after pressing the lamp-power-on button were nerve wracking.&&Fun fact, the oil from your skin also makes me explode. &&The crud from your finger (sodium) plus heat would devitrify the quartz glass, meaning that  some of the glass turns into its ceramic analogue, and becoming just very slightly milky white. This makes that one section of glass hold more heat which devitrifies it even more, and so on until you have a seriously weak part of the glass. On the high pressure xenon bulbs, you're going to eventually  I have a explosion. On halogen bulbs they tend not to explode, just burn out, with a suspiciously finger sized white bubble on it.

When people brought bulbs back to me for replacement saying they hadn't lasted long enough, the bubbles were an instant ""sorry, no"".&&That happens with flood light bulbs too, as I found out&&holes?&&Omnimax. Yes, I've definitely seen them do this.&&[deleted]&&Dolby Atmos still uses speakers in all the old positions, it adds more (particularly in the ceiling) and different processing, but the speakers in the photo could be from just about any decent cinema, Atmos or not.

(Part of what Atmos does is define sound sources in 3D space, rather than having distinct ""channels"" of sound for a defined number of speakers. This way the processor for a particular system can better decide what to play through each speaker, whether you have 5.1, 7.2.4, or any other configuration)&&I think you're both right.  The front speakers are 5 channel (L/CL/C/CR/R) screen speakers, which is mostly for Atmos but also used to be used for SDDS-8 (SDDS's typical 5.1 plus two extra screen speakers, rarely used). 

But- this is definitely an AMC Prime setup, which does feature Dolby Atmos.  You can tell from the seats and the specialty surround speaker.  ~~And I'm 99% sure this is the big house at the AMC Empire 25, which was indeed one of the first Atmos systems in the US, and the timing adds up.~~  

TL,DR: OP is reposting for sweet karma but OOP isn't wrong, you two have good eyes, I spent too much time in movie theaters.

EDIT: Nope, it is an AMC but it's in Kansas City, OOP shows up below to set us straight.&&It wouldn't be more than a few millimeters at most.  Subwoofers are what move significant amounts of air, and they're on the floor and/or under the seats. Those tweeters and midrange drivers behind the screen comparatively move very little air. Compound that with the fact that most of the ~~liudery~~ louder sounds are going to play during very visibly-active parts of a movie -- with the images on the screen moving/changing quickly, it would be even harder to notice any slight screen movements.

EDIT: How the fuck did I manage to type ""liudery""?&&The screens are [acoustically transparent](http://m.elitescreens.com/front/front/productdetail/product/100)&&No people, let's bring it *off*&&You too&&If you look further down, there's a comment about three hours older where OP tells someone it wasn't his pic. So OP isn't being an asshole. &&Awww man, don't destroy this moment for us :(&&Oh I agree with you. The wife and I are fairly exclusive to Dolby Cinema screens unless it's an indie and we have no choice. For all the big movies? Dolby's got my money. 

My local AMC is probably one of the busiest in the country and their projectors are dated/rarely properly aligned, and the screens always have stuff on them. It's not worth the money on their regular screens with regular seats. I can't stand it. I complain to the staff literally every time about something different in regards to the actual viewing of the movie. I'm that guy. It's kinda my day job so when it's fucked when I am trying to relax, it's extra infuriating.

Of course, once the OP popped up, the use who posted this time did add him in as the source on the imgur page.  So. . . there's that. &&A picture of you full of pitchforks wouldn't be a repost.

I say we lower the torches and go back to the bar&&Yes, but 5 screen channels have been around for years.  The TODD-AO system, used 5 behind the screen and one surround, and was first used on OKLAHOMA! in 1955. 

6-track 70mm also originally used 5 stage channels and a single mono surround channel,  oly upon Apocalypse Now's 1979 release did they change over to today's 5.1 setup 3 stage channel/split surround/boom channel setup (and most of the time didn't have the .1).&&And SAAAAAAAAAY YOU'LL WATCH ME every Saturday matinee

Depending on the kind of projector, they'll either simply exhaust heat out the back or be connected to some kind of ducting for AC purposes.&&[deleted]&&I have a fan venting from the projector straight outside with an identical fav blowing in fresh air (equalise pressure). Plus in summer a 3phase cooling air con blower running. (sun hits concrete wall late afternoon and temperature spikes)
&&Modern cinema grade projectors (at least the non-laser ones) put out a shitload of heat. 

Cinema projectors typically use [Xenon Arc Lamps](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Xenon_arc_lamp) as a light source. Arc lamps are extremely bright. They work by creating an arc between two metal rods inside of a pressurized xenon tube. I mean, its essentially like creating and using a continuous bolt of lightning as a light source... As you can imagine this creates a *lot* of heat. To deal with this, larger arc lamps actually have liquid cooling systems built into the lamp itself. 

To deal with the heat, cinemas typically have a dedicated exhaust system with a cooling duct connected to the projector in order to siphon/blow out all the excess waste heat. Additionally they might have a dedicated intake duct to feed the projector cool air. This is one of the reasons that projection booths have to be soundproof because otherwise you would hear all the loud exhaust equipment and projector fans running.

**Fun Fact:** Xenon arc lamps are pressurized to extremely high pressures (about 450psi) in order to achieve maximum efficiency. At these pressures they are basically like grenades if they are broken so depending on how large of a bulb you are dealing with, it can be *very* dangerous to handle and can require donning full-body safety gear and face shield.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Probably some kind of lease program that includes service and replacement. They'd get taken off site and stripped down for parts or even fully refurbished. &&20,000 hours is a *long* time for projector operation, so by the time the lasers are running out, there's likely to be some other internals wearing out as well (fans, power, light processing, etc.). Also, by that time, the tech can easily be obsolete (or at least not up to par for the application).

Once a PJ gets to that point though, it's likely going to vary based on who makes it whether or not it can be serviced easily/at all. Some companies have easy to fix PJs, some not so much.&&Bulb changes were fun. The most fun was destroying the old one. Back against the dumpster, crouched down, tossing it in to ensure it breaks.

If you look closely at the bulb when it's new and move it around a little, you'll see the tiny blob of mercury rattling around in the bulb.

This is why they take a while to 'warm up'. The mercury is vapourized by the heat and mixes with the xenon gas, which is what makes the proper colour and brightness, but it takes some time for the mercury to actually vapourize fully.

I always wanted to work projection and then our theater switched back around 2011. &&and the union projectionists with 20 year careers and were hard core film nerds were replaced with pimply teens&&I worked at a Malco in the early 2000s. All the 14 projectors were mechanical, and it was a full time job operating and maintaining them. But once we had them set up and started, we'd just sit in our little window and watch movies.

25 percent of the day was hectic, the rest was just sitting around making sure nothing malfunctioned.&&We should get into sprockets and aperture plates. &&Ooh, that's a bingo!&&I don't speak Italian.

Like I said, third best.&&It's true. I work in a live performance theatre which started life as a 1949 movie house. The old projection booth is now behind what is the prop room (former balcony) and it is a fireproof room. You should see the doors. They look like fallout shelter doors. &&This guy did projection.  Did you also break the bulbs when they were EOL and get the tungsten?&&That's also for a projector slightly bigger than what you'd find in a home theater. A real movie theater projector will be several kilowatts, and the old film [IMAX projectors used 15 kilowatt bulbs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Xenon_IMAX_1.jpg).&&Why would he get arrested for that? &&> we were told it was about 500$ per bulb

I don't doubt it. In fact, that seems a little low. &&I once quoted out a bulb to an IMAX theatre that was something like $3000.  We didn't get the order, so they were probably less than that from other suppliers.&&And behind that is your dog.&&That's sadly true, none of Sondheim really translates as well to the common viewer as Les Mis or Phantom can. Except for Sweeney Todd, but even then that's a stretch.&&The theater I work at is part of a really big chain, and it's pretty much all plug and play. Even the Fathom Event stuff (old school movies being shown on their anniversaries, and concert live streams and stuff like that) are all send in pretty much ready to go. We actually have a sweet older lady who comes in every week and checks to make sure all the trailers are playing like they're supposed to.&&When I still worked as a manager at a movie theater 4-5 years ago, trailers and movies came on what was essentially a hard drive. These would get loaded onto a projector, and we had a program to basically drag and drop trailers and the feature film into a playlist. If I had to guess, even that probably isn't necessary anymore.&&For most places, it just comes on a USB drive which the movie on it.  

Edit: Here's a interesting [imugr post](https://imgur.com/a/hTjrV) that made the rounds through reddit a while ago. My understanding is that it's basically about giant flash drive (pretty sure they use ssd's now). 

Edit: I also found [the original reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3tdmhs/this_is_how_movies_are_delivered_to_your_local) that I linked to&&As a projectionist for a small chain in Australia, each Tuesday night we select relevant trailers and place the requested advertising in the show package. So yes, we still do a lot of stuff on-site.&&Dang. I was an apprentice projectionist in '90-'91 and I remember each movie coming in about 3 reels to a box and about 3 boxes per movie then having to splice them together into one giant reel that laid horizontal on a platter about 4 feet across then meticulously feeding it through the brain and eventually the projector and then back to an empty platter on the platter rack. Was way more to it like the sound line and slack loops but it's been a few years. Now it's plug and play. &&For my theater. They send us the movie and a list of what ads and c trailers need to be on it and what order. So we add them to a playlist and put what time the lights should come on.

We also have a pre show and that's sent directly from head office. Not sure exactly how it works but it just plays through a computer.

No one is ever in booth, my job is to check each theater at the time they are supposed to start to make sure everything worked&&Same thing if the sound cuts out or something.  Somebody needs to run out and find an employee to notify, because no one is paying attention.  The problem is that no one wants to be the one to run out if it comes back on automatically, because they'd probably miss out on that part of the film.&&But that job isn't there anymore so don't worry.&&Such good memories. I once got called in early on a night shift because the dayshift genius started the wrong film on a 2 movie screen, then decided to try and back the film off onto 6,000 foot reels using the makeup table, without having the ring in the middle on the platter. He flung the whole movie onto the ground and ~12,000 feet of film exploded about 15-20 feet. 

We must've put 200 splices into that film putting it back together, and I got to play it the next day, with no bad splices. Unfortunately the dust ate that film up... I packed it up at the end of that week and sent it back, never heard anything about it.&&A good amount of the pimply teens working at theaters are hardcore film nerds too. A lot of the 18 - 20 year olds working there before I left ended up being great friends of mine because I could actually talk and discuss with them about film, and most of us in this circle want a career and a future in film.


This is serious gatekeeping, you don't have to be a unionized projectionist working minimum wage at a fucking movie theater to do well in such an entry level job. Besides that, many of the projectionists still work at the location either as managers or shift leads making more than they did operating a projector.&&If I wasn't working on the concession counter, downtime between movies dropping were usually spent watching the end of shitty films I wasn't gonna see anyway.

If you're a fan of The Room, I think you'll really like it. I'm not a big fan of James Franco, but his portrayal of Tommy is overall really funny.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOUJjYsU1NQ&&Wow. You're telling me the reason that exact scene was so bad is because he fucked it up so many times that they all cheered when he got it right? That's amazing...

&&Fuck, the hug that 'Greg' gives 'Tommy' makes me really think they're not gonna shy away from the actual and true friendship that the book talks about. 

Because I think that was the saddest for me even with all the humour - they did really love each other as (best) friends and almost as brothers but it got tainted by a man's ego and desire to be bigger than himself. 

I'm holding hope they capture that. 

They'll have no problem with the absurdity and the humour. Seth Rogen is going to be fucking brilliant as the producer and I'm already laughing my arse off. Hopefully they also show Tommy hitting his fucking head on the Entrance way and just eating shit because that brought tears of laughter to me in the book. &&I really hope Tommy Wiseau likes this movie. I'll feel so bad for him if they mock him too much, he put a lot of emotion into The Room. Either way, he's going to be a rich man....&&This needs to be good. Like really good. Ever since they announced this being released in December I've been jerking it nightly to the idea that this movie will be so good that it will win an Oscar.

I **need** Tommy Wiseau at the Oscars.

It got a standing ovation and was absolutely hilarious, but was also really emotional. You really feel for Tommy, which was very hard to accomplish. &&I hope we have audience participation sessions for this movie too, haha &&Just finished reading the book, and this teaser sold me on this movie. I think James Franco nails the mannerisms and look of Tommy, but the accent could use some work.&&A lot of people complaining that Franco doesn't sell his accent enough or that it's undercooked.

Personal theory: if he went all in on the character (which we all know he's capable of) it would be almost *too* hammy, too unbelievable, that it wouldn't mesh with the production of this movie. Which I get, that's the whole point of this film, but it might be one of those ""truth is stranger than fiction"" kinda things where 100% Wiseau is just too much.&&I love how this teaser prompts people to give 'The Room' a watch. A very well thought teaser. &&If you love The Room, you gotta watch Tiptoes. Imagine The Room with Matthew McConaughey, Peter Dinklage, Gary Oldman, Kate Beckinsale and Patricia Arquette. It's hard to believe the amount of talent in this shitshow. 

McConaughey's character gets engaged to Beckinsale's, and he neglects to tell her about his deep, dark family secret: everyone in his family is a little person! Including his twin brother. No, Dinklage doesn't play his brother. Oldman does. And he does it on his knees. Very, very poorly. Especially in the fight scene. Dinklage plays the most one-dimensional Frenchman ever. He even shouts at one point, ""I want a fuckin crepe!""

One critic called Tiptoes ""Blackface for little people."" The Room has no equal in the trainwreck category, and that's why it is so special. But to be honest, I laughed a lot harder at Tiptoes.&&I had no idea that The Room existed.  This was a real movie?  I'm seriously asking.  They weren't making a ""Sharknado"" type movie that is bad on purpose?  After watching some clips on YouTube, I have to somehow see the whole movie.  It is the best worst acting I have ever seen.  And The Disaster Artist has the chance to be really funny.&&I really need to watch The Room. I feel like I'm missing out, I keep saying I'll watch and have yet to do so.

Edit: I wrote out a really long edit describing how I felt at what I watched last night and my piece of shit phone decided to reset when I was like two words to go. I'll try and do it justice a second time here. 

Oh. 

My. 

God. 

That was the greatest worst thing I've ever seen. Everything about it was god awful in the very best way possible. Like EVERYTHING was awful but somehow totally endearing. How is that even possible!? 

Tommy sure has passion but my god he can't act, write or direct lol. You could hear his words come out of everyone else..and not in a good way (except it is). As the film went on I kept getting more amazed at how this is allowed to even exist haha. 

Johnny, for being such a 'super swell guy' is an unintentional dick when someone speaks to him. Pour your heart out? Well you're getting the shortest answer possible among with a ""haah, haah"" for your troubles lol. It's like he tried to make the nicest guy ever and in ways massively succeeded and in ways didn't. The laugh, the everything really was simply amazing. 

EVERYONE was so awkward. I really don't know how that's possible, that every single person in the film gives the impression that they just so happen to have cameras on them for when they've met other humans for the first time lol. That is an impressive thing to pull off. 

Every kiss in the film was like a fish, it was as if all their first kisses ever filmed. 

I swear Laura was laughing/smiling during the majority of her scenes and I don't blame her, I wouldn't be able to hold back the laughter or tears if I was involved in that film. Although saying that, I'd do ANYTHING to have been there for every single day of shooting, those that were are some of the luckiest people of all time haha. 

Denny comes across as a creepy serial killer and I'm pretty sure that wasn't the plan lol..or maybe it was, who knows what the plans were for this film lol. 

The whole thing from start to finish was a journey. A journey I thought I was prepared for but evidently was not. It exceeded every single expectation I had. I'd always felt like I'd seen the film cause I'd seen clips and knew what the deal was with it but it turns out I didn't know shit until last night lol. It really was everything people have said it was only you really you can't begin to understand until you've seen it and I now get that. 

I will 100% be watching it again and likely soon because although I watched it alone, I said to friends I was going to watch it and one who hasn't seen it said if I think it's worth watching, he'll watch it with me and obviously we all know that means he's going to be seeing it very soon haha. 

I'm rambling so I'll end with this. THANK YOU for the replies telling me to watch it. If I hadn't got them I likely would have put this off and I now know that I'd been putting it off for far too long. I wish my original 'review' didn't go missing as it was mostly done as soon as the film ended while I still had that super fresh amazement and a few drinks in me and definitely gave a better impression of how I felt but I really hope that what I've said here lets you know exactly how much I loved this film, and trust me it's a lot.

If anyone disagrees with the awesomeness that is The Room then leave your stupid comments in your pocket.


10/10. Watch if you haven't seen it.&&Did people forget Tommy dubbed all his lines in the movie? It is quite possible the accent is different when he is filming compared to when he dubs the lines&&Man, you guys wont be happy unless everyone was played by the real person.&&I was not sold on James Franco as Tommy Wiseau.

I am now sold on James Franco as Tommy Wiseau.
&&As with the poster, this trailer doesn't quell my fears that this movie will not just be tons of Room quotes. I know they need to market it like this, but it doesn't sell me on this project yet. Franco not doing an accent is kind of jarring too. 

Want to see more.&&His Tommy Wiseau impression is pretty fucking weak. He just sounds like James Franco. &&It seems that in order to fully capture the essence of Tommy/Johnny, one has to forget everything they've ever learned as an actor. Say what you will about Franco's acting abilities, but he'll never be the same after this movie.&&Yes, in the book they had to give him a prop (the water bottle) to, I guess, somewhat distract him into saying the simple line. Pretty much every single take that has Tommy in it took them a ridiculous amount of takes to get right and even then the majority of his lines had to be redubbed because it was so hard to understand him with his accent.&&Yes and at one point he banged his head really hard on the doorway and they had to take a long break. Tommy could not understand or remember his own lines. 

The best part is how they built a rooftop set with green screen in a car park. Instead of just filming on an actual roof. 

The film will be a classic if it covers even just half of the book.&&In his book, Greg Sestero claims that it took a sit ton of takes, but [Tommy Wiseau rejects this claim.](https://youtu.be/CMwpMVJ9oog?t=35s) &&Read the book! It's brilliant. The stuff that Sestero describes about the shooting of the movie isn't even the best part. &&Yes. It took around 6 hours to film.&&> he did not seem amused

That is hoe you know a biopic is going to be good.&&Did Tommy seem like he didn't like the movie? I thought he consulted on it and helped get it made?

Makes sense that he'd turn on it though. There was a documentary on the movie that he and his lawyers shut down hard.&&Can you speak to Franco's impresssion? Does his voice work in the rest of the movie? It seems like his voice is just James Franco. &&If you read the book this is based on, I think it was Greg Sestero's suggestion to hold a prop so Tommy would have something to be dramatic with&&I'm sorry, he's named for Matt Damon and his name is fucking Mark? 

I need to see this train wreck. &&and a flying car.&&>subplot Wiseau wanted to add where he turns into a vampire.

...like, moreso?&&> where he turns into a vampire. 

Guess that explains his look.&&The best ""so bad it's good"" movies are the ones where they tried to make a good movie. Tommy cared about the movie. He was trying to make a solid movie. It just failed on every level. That's why this is such a classic now. Bad movies like Sharknado do nothing for me because they are making a bad movie and know it. &&You haven't seen it until you've really seen it. Be warned though, there are like three awkward, overlong 90's softcore porn style sex scenes within the first half hour and it can really test your patience. &&Definitely watch it. You can't really appreciate how terrible/fantastic the thing is until you've seen it from start to finish. It's a totally different expirience than any other movie ever made.&&Watch it at home with subs before you catch a midnight show. Trust me, you won't be able to hear a thing if you see it in theaters first.&&Watch with friends and alcohol.&&It might be the only movie that I could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, I've watched in 5-6 times so far and every time I watch I notice a new mistake they made.&&Anyway, how's your sex life?&&What a teaser Maurk!&&I think the issue is that Wiseau's acting is so unnatural that is is literally impossible for Franco to portray Wiseau in a manner that feels natural.&&You've convinced me, Franco's got an Oscar coming his way.&&I'm sure being a horrible actor doesn't help&&It took two hours, and a few more than the 67 takes shown in the trailer.

Tommy was five hours late to the set that day.

This was literally the very first scene that they shot.&&Same thing with him laughing after hearing that a woman was beaten and ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street: it was the only take that had good audio

Edit: fat fingers created weird typos&&Yup, the book is a very fascinating read full of details like this. Check it out if you can. &&I seriously didnt know he was following a script. I thought it was just him mumbling out dialogue and then editing it together into that monstrosity. &&I'm a little confused as early reviews for this suggested that he completely ""disappeared into the role,"" like Steve Carell in *Foxcatcher*. This... doesn't quite give me that impression. It's a middle-of-the-road impersonation, at least based on this one scene.

That said, I've been waiting for this trailer for literally a year, and I can't say I'm disappointed. I'm still *super excited* for this movie, and this scene is still pretty damn funny even if the impersonation isn't rock-solid.

I nearly split a gut laughing at ""I HIT HER!""&&I'm actually happy with Franco's choice in accent and performance in this clip.


I think we were expecting a total mock of Tommy, whose drawl is unique and distinct, but this portrayal makes the impersonation less cartoony.

I feel like this was perfect, because it reminds me of the way Bennett Miller and Philip Seymour Hoffman approached Capote. I recall they spoke about fearing that the performance may have been looked at as TOO fake, or seen as an impression rather than a performance; it was either going to be loved or despised. They felt that anyone who was as large of a character as Capote was, with such distinct characteristics to his mannerisms and voice, that subtlety was the better way to go. Any vocal interpretation that was done too grandiosely would take the audience out of the movie. 

I am so happy that Franco went with this, instead of trying to exactly mock Tommy; I think the movie will succeed more because of that.&&There were definitely points where he sounded better than others, when he was yelling out that the director needed to say action louder he sounded just like Tommy, but when he trying the actual takes he didn't really change his voice much. &&Jason Mantzoukas as well. I would find it fitting if over the end credits they just played the How Did This Get Made ep of The Room. It would be... bonkers. 

Edit: June too. Awesome.

Edit: Guys guys guys. Can we all just gather here and talk about the How Did This Get Made episode of The Room. And then maybe we find out we all died and went to Reddit heaven and this becomes a Jacob's Ladder scenario and this whole Disaster Artist movie was never even a thing.&&And I definitely heard ""not"" instead of ""naaaht"".&&Franco needed to put a little more stank-o on the ""did naaaht!"".  Wiseau delivers that with a little bit more anguish and Franco just kinda dumps it out of his mouth.

Edit:  Yes, I get it that the lines were dubbed in later, but I'm  referring mostly to the facial expression.  Tommy's looked labored whereas Franco doesn't emote that.&&Well his lines in that scene where recorded over the actual performance so maybe they will ADR it&&Maybe this isnt the final take just something for the trailer.&&I'm excited to see Roger kill it in an actual role again instead of just playing himself. He keeps getting typecast as this stoner character and I wanna see his range again
Edit: Rogen god damn autocorrect &&He already is a rich man. Even before The Room became a cult hit he had made a fortune through some kind of mysterious and shady sounding means; enough to finance the (ludicrously expensive given its quality) movie out of pocket. It's one of the more intriguing aspects of his character.&&On the other hand, if it gets any Oscar nominations, Tommy might finally have a chance to go to the Academy Awards&&Isn't he supposed to have a cameo&&If I recall, I think Tommy actually has a cameo in this movie&&Just everything about that would be fantastic. Just picture Ryan Seacrest having to interview him on the red carpet.&&Holy shit, is this real life? Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau BACK IN ACTION?! HELL YES&&Eh...  it depends on what you are expecting out of it.  It will not be like the room in terms of being so bad it's good.  That caught lightning in the bottle and you can't replicate that.

It might be weird to watch just because Wiseau is just a weird guy and he has odd mannerisms.  But it won't be hilarious.&&It feels like he keeps going back and forth from Franco mode to Wiseau mode&&[deleted]&&Yeah it's really jarring. Doesn't seem like he's putting any effort into the voice and ultimately it feels more like a parody than something with genuine passion behind the performance.

I loved the rest of the teaser, but that voice work is so half arsed that it puts a bit of damper on things considering how important the voice is. &&Yes you do. &&You also need to read The Disaster Artist. Actually, listen to the audiobook. Sestero does a great job, especially his impression on Tommy.&&Did it have a Tommy cameo? I saw an interview with Franco where he was unclear if they would actually use the Tommy scene in the film. He got kinda weird when they asked him about the cameo and it kinda felt like maybe there was some friction between him and Tommy.&&Plastic spoon manufacturers stand to make an absolute killing.&&Meta-participation. You will be throwing pictures of plastic spoons at the screen

&&Never go full Wiseau&&I disagree. I think Oldman as the midget is one of the most bewildering special effects I've ever seen in a movie. How the fuck did they do it?&&You owe it to yourself. Make sure to drink some alcohol first. In fact, you'll probably need a bunch just to get through the movie. It's so awful it becomes hilarious...then goes right back around to being awful...then continues going until it passes hilarious and awful a few more times. Then, by the time it goes to make one more pass to stop at hilarious, the movie ends and you're left feeling empty inside but with an insatiable need to quote it constantly.

There have been so many times I have used the ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA"" line on my wife (her name is Lisa). Usually when we're trying to figure out what to eat for lunch.&&Read the book.  It's about a whole lot more than the movie&&The most convincing part of that performance is the hair.&&I agree. His James Franco Impression is pretty spot-on.&&[deleted]&&lol that's amazing...

Because they were dubbed!&&I just rewatched that scene and now it looks like Tommy has his eyes closed because he's straining so hard trying to concentrate on saying the line&&Yeah, you can pretty easily tell his lines are dubbed by how they sound in the movie.  &&> Tommy could not understand  
  
Didnt he write the script?&&I've never seen The Room, but didn't Tommy actually own property in San Fransisco with the rooftop view they wanted to use? &&Haha... yeah, don't believe anything Tommy says.  He has a severely loose grip on reality.&&That whole interview is great.

Interviewer: *What advice do you have for young filmmakers?*

Tommy: *Don't believe what people give you - bad advice, or sometimes good advice, maybe.*

So in other words, don't take any advice? Yeah, that sounds like a philosophy that would lead to a movie like The Room. Also, love the way he promotes his personal line of underwear at the end, which, by the way have a secret pocket and double stitching.&&He was more coherent in this short clip than he was in the entire movie.&&[deleted]&&Honestly I highly recommend the audio book.  Sestero has he best Tommy impression around and makes it really immersive &&From what I've heard, Tommy isn't very amused at people's view of the movie in general. &&Yeah, hoe! &&It seems like Tommy was flattered that they wanted to make a movie about The Room (which is basically about him), but I got the impression he did not appreciate the outcome since the audience spent most of time basically laughing at his words and actions (via James Franco's impression of him).&&He sent his lawyers after Doug Walker because he made fun of it in a review. The funny thing is, his review made more people watch the movie&&I saw a test screening of this over a year ago. This scene definitely doesn't show off Franco's impression very well. They should have teased another scene. His impression is really great throughout the film. &&He was [pretty dramatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5PuJGzbcvY) with the water bottle.&&They probably had to mark it down so he'd remember.

Oh hi Mark.&&It's been awhile since I read the book but I think it was because he thought his name was Mark Damon.&&YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, MARK DAMON!&&Grab a few buddies and get really drunk.

It'll be the best mistake of your life.&&What stopped him? I fully support both of those ideas.&&Well, the flying car was to explain that he was a vampire.&&Yes, that is what's so great about this movie.  Tommy was so clueless and thought he was making a great movie.  Amazing in every way.  It can't be replicated. &&I agree! Troll2 is another awesomely bad movie where the director thought it was brilliant. 

&&Never seen the room, but I agree. It's all the rage now to cash in on the ""so bad it's good"" cultural phenomenon, so they crank out Sharknado movies that are awful because it's funny to do bad cliches. &&There are actually 4, but 2 of them are literally the same exact scene

Edit: just in case anyone who hasn't seen the room doesn't understand what I mean, Tommy literally took the sex scene between Johnny and Lisa from the beginning of the movie and added it to another part of the movie where Johnny and Lisa were having sex again, with all the rose petals, belly buttons and oddly muscular Tommy you could ever ask for.&&The funniest thing about Tommy's sex scenes is they just repeat the same footage and pretend like it's a totally different scene.&&>you haven't seen it until you've really seen it.

Literally true. &&We sometimes do a bad movie night. I brought The Room. Fifteen minutes in and the host **made** me select a different movie.&&Piggybacking off the comment, if you're able to see an actual screening of it at a theatre, that might be a fun way to experience it! It can be like screenings of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, with a cult like atmosphere filled with props and stuff.&&Make it into a drinking game and see who is still alive 20 minutes in.

Source: died in college this way.&&Do people throw spoons and quote the movie in other theatres as well?&&Well, it's official.  I definitely have breast cancer.&&Can't talk about it.&&It's confidential&&There actually is no hospital on that street, Greg improv'd that line to try to get a reaction out of Tommy that wasn't a laugh, since that street is where Tommy lived and had this weird obsession about not letting anyone find out where he lived.&&I thought that the impression was decent enough that it didn't take me out of the scene. Here's to hoping the script is great! &&It's not perfect, though you'd be hard pressed to find someone who could perfectly recreate Wiseau's uh, talents. 

Do you think those reviews could be referring to a side of Wiseau that the majority of us have probably never seen, i.e. the 'behind the scenes' Wiseau calling for line reads? Or is that giving Franco's performance too much credit? Can't wait for this to come out.&&I wonder if he gets into Tommy's personal life or his reaction after releasing the movie. Either way this looks hilarious and the actors look on point.&&Yeah his performance seems a bit disappointing but this was a well done teaser that has me interested.&&Kind of agreed. Moreso, his performance in this scene is pretty flat compared to the actual scene in the movie. Wiseau's weird passion is lacking. 

that said, im still super excited&&Well I trust the people who actually saw the movie and not a 1 minute clip.&&To me, he sounds like he does do the total copy of Tommy's voices on some lines. And on some it just sounds like Franco. Now it's a weird feeling of, sounds like Tommy...sounds like Franco...sounds like Tommy...&&June Diane Raphael also in this movie as Robyn Paris. &&Guys, they can't all be Jacob's Ladder scenarios. But this one definitely is.&&What's up, jerks!? 

Wasn't Sestero literally the guest host for that episode, as well?&&You must really be the Jason of your group&&June is also in it!&&Give him a break. It's hard to try to impersonate such a genius actor.

oh hi mark&&well in the real movie the line is over-dubbed&&He was awesome as Steve Wozniak.&&Took me a while to figure out who Roger is.

But yes, I agree. &&Who is roger?&&I've heard it's very possible he used the film to launder illegal money and it's hard to trace exactly who he was before he came to America, like even what his name really was. &&Tommy Wiseau is DB Cooper&&If it wins any Oscars, they should let Tommy speak.  That'd be the greatest acceptance speech of all time...&&Apparently James Franco had to put in a contractually obligated cameo for Tommy Wiseau.&&I'd love it if for just one scene Tommy played himself.  For like 20 seconds they just switch from Franco to Wiseau.&&*~*~~~**Buzz Kill Alert**~~~*~*&&He seems to be using his regular voice when Tommy isn't ""acting"", and using his Tommy voice when he is ""acting"".&&He does a perfect James Wiseau. Still not at Tommy Franco level though.&&I mean you just can't take Samuel L. Jackson and nail the look of Wiseau is probably what he means but yeah the costume people deserve it as well.&&I feel like it may make dramatic scenes far easier to watch and buy into. It will be really jarring though for mega fans of The Room.&&He does naaaht.&&Yeah, he is in it in some capacity&&Why is the plastic spoon throwing a thing? I've seen the movie and I still don't understand (or maybe can't remember) &&Never make your reddit username go full Wiseau&&He's probably toning down his performance to be more believable. &&Yet it's that x3 and then some, what kind of reality is this lol&&[Yuuuuup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-IvV8thrO4)
&&[deleted]&&Yes. Yes he did. And yet he still couldn't remember his lines.&&Yes. Welcome to The Room.&&You're realizing why The Room is such a marvel&&Yup. He was also the director and producer. That's why they asked if he just wanted to change the line on one of those takes.&&Yes, which made his complete inability to remember his lines all the more hilarious. 

&&Yup. He insisted on green screen. &&He was paranoid about his address being disclosed. Since hes a russian vampire mob boss he doesnt want anyone to know where he lives. He almost killed greg when he almost alluded to where tommy lived&&I don't even believe that his name is tommy&&I don't trust Tommy on the subject of his own nationality, let alone on details about filming.&&Absolutely! I listened to the audiobook as well and I couldn't believe it wasn't actually Tommy Wiseau. &&Yes, it's so good! I love the conversations between Tommy and Greg's mom. They way Greg changes between their accents is so perfect. &&I don't know...he shows up frequently at movie screenings where everyone laughs it the whole time and he seems to soak in the attention.

He's even changed his story from stating it's a serious drama to now claiming he *INTENDED* it to be a dark comedy.

Yeahhhh right...&&i can empathize with that. I think it's important to be able to laugh at yourself, but even when you take some jokes in stride, there comes a point where it crosses that line between friendly ribbing and mean spirited piling on.&&I mean... does he not know that's what everyone does when they watch The Room?&&Wow over a year ago? Was it the whole film or just a portion? Also.... How?!&&After seeing the green screen in the trailer I just realized how atrocious the background was.&&Did they re-dub over Tommy's voice in this movie?? It just looks so off. &&Is it dubbed? What the fuck is wrong with the audio&&I've never actually seen footage from that movie. It's actually THAT bad. Crazy!&&So anyways how's your sex life?

Did you know I'm actually dying of cancer?

Hi doggie

*throws football&&Ah yes. 

My favourite actor. 

Matt Wahlberg. &&To be fair, a decade ago I also thought Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon was the same guy.&&Those two were tied together, they didn't have the budget to do flying car cgi so they dropped the vampire plotline altogether.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I'm pretty sure it only happened because it was too awkward for the actress to shoot the scene again.&&Funny thing about that is that Tommy enjoyed the first sex scene so much that he went back and wrote a second one, but Juliette Daniel (I think is the name of the actress who plays Lisa) was uncomfortable doing another one with Tommy, so he just reused the footage from the first scene&&She wouldn't shoot another sex scene, so they had to use footage from the first.&&Dude, spoilers! /s &&Maybe he's just very consistent in the bedroom.&&That's because the budget couldn't afford fresh linens for the bed and they didn't want to film a second time because it'd be covered with icky sex marks.

Oh hi Mark.&&Not much of a bad movie night if your host can't get into THE bad movie&&If the host of a bad movie night turns off ""The Room"" fifteen minutes in then I don't think they ever understood the point of the event to begin with.&&Seriously? This is the best movie you could ever watch for a bad movie night. We used to do that too in college, and The Room was by far the best night we ever had doing it!&&That's a bad host for a bad movie night. They must have a low tolerance for bad movies. 

You should try Heartbeeps, Pigkeeper's Daughter, King Frat, Boardinghouse or Sinful Dwarf. They'd beg you to put the Room back on. 

What do they normally watch? Bad romcoms of the 80's? &&It was at the Tommy Wiseau ass shot, wasn't it?&&[deleted]&&If you don't already, you should watch ""best of the Worst"" by red letter media on youtube. It's great. &&You sure it wasn't ""Bad Host Night"" and not ""Bad Movie Night""?&&Heard your first viewing really shouldn't be in a movie setting. You won't be able to hear any of the Oscar award winning dialouge &&Our drunken game was: drink at every uncomfortable Wiseau laugh. And there are many, many there are!&&We do in St. Louis&&Our theatre held weekly screenings and supplied a bucket of spoons.&&Seeing this movie at the music box theater in Chicago was an entirely different experience. The entire crowd basically follows an off script script of their own interaction with the movie. It's like seeing a playwright. People throw spoons when they appear on screen, people play catch with a football in front of the screen, etc. Can't remember them all because it's so intricate. 

I also got to meet Tommy Wiseau that night and it was the greatest moment of my life. &&I laughed for like 20 minutes after this one.&&Far and away my favourite line of the movie. Comes out of nowhere, is said completely nonchalantly, and is never spoken of again. Amazing.&&> Well, it's official. I definitely have breast cancer.

Look, don’t worry about it. Everything will be fine.&&probably my favorite lowkey parts of this film. a supporting character gets breast cancer, says so once, and it is never mentioned again&&why naht?&&When they're playing football, and Johnny tackles Mark, that was actually Tommy attacking Greg, yelling, ""NO FRENCH!"" because Greg said something in French. Same reasoning  &&The important thing with impressions isn't to just sound the same but to *seem* the same. I think he did a good job.&&[Greg Sestero (Mark) does an amazing Tommy Wisseau in the Disaster Artist audiobook](https://youtu.be/K40IToeN51Y?t=62)&&Greg Sestero does a pretty amazing job at the Wiseau voice who I heard helped Franco out with his performance, so it strikes me as odd how far off Franco's attempt is.&&I could see it ending like Ed Wood, where the last scene is the big premiere of his ""masterpiece"". We know it's schlock but we cut off right as he's ready for Hollywood to accept him with open arms.&&I hear Mark had a hand in assembling the trailer.

Oh hi Mark.&&They should have gone for a retake.&&Flat is the best way to describe it. Tommy has a weird way of emphasizing syllables, and Franco doesn't do that at all. Also, for one of the most referenced scenes of the movie to come off flat lowers my expectations a bit. Might be for the best though. Better to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.&&Tommy Wiseau re dubbed all of his lines in The Room. This could be fairly accurate to what his real performance was like.&&This.  It feels off.  And in this type of story it's distracting to only occassionally put on the accent.&&Is that intentional? Did they intentionally cast the whole How Did This Get Made crew for a movie about terrible movies?

If so, that may be the first ever instance of podcast-based stunt casting.&&Put 'er in a bra! &&Yes. Anyone who is mildly interested in this movie should absolutely listen to that episode. It happened years ago when The Room was just picking up steam... Sestero had not even published the book yet.&&I hope she talks about everyone's wigs. &&That he was. In Act III the conversation between him and Fassbender was brilliant. &&Seth Rogen

he made a typo&&What a story mark&&If you read the book, Greg actually talks a lot about that. He's pretty sure that there isn't anything illegal going on, and Tommy is just a weirdo who doesn't want anyone to know that he's un-American.

Apparently he came to America with nothing but the shirt on his back, then got a job selling toys at a peir for the mob. (Yes, really) Eventually the toys did so well that he split off and sold his own, at which point he started climbing the ladder and branching out. Most of his money came from selling irregular blue jeans. It's just another ""American Success"" story.

Believe me, the movie has been inspected inside and out by pretty much anyone concerned with fraud. Tommy was very passionate about his movie, the main problem is just that he's pretty delusional, and a few spoons short of a gallery.&&Tommy is an alien. From space. He struggles with pretending to be human.&&Where did he come from, where did he go? Where did he come from, Tommy Wiseau?&&[relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1400/)&&He shows up and speaks in his real British accent.

So my body is ready.  &&What if he plays Franco&&Next he's gonna tell us Santa isn't real and one's first  love doesn't last forever.&&You just made me want a film I'll never get to see...&&Lisa's apartment is inexplicably decorated with framed pictures of spoons. As a result, film-goers are often provided with plastic spoons and then encouraged to throw them at the screen whenever they appear. :D&&Never go full Wiseau&&Maybe Franco will go back and dub all of his own lines again. Wouldn't make sense, but it would be a good goof.&&The stories that resulted from the production of The Room somehow managed to be even more entertaining than the movie itself.  One of my personal highlights from The Disaster Artist.

>I looked around, thinking, Props, because props always helped Tommy; they took his mind off trying to act. I saw a nearby water bottle and grabbed it. “Here,” I said, handing the bottle to Tommy. “Use this. You know what you’re supposed to do, right? So do it. What do you always tell me? Show some emotion.”
Tommy smiled in pure, holy relief. “Why didn’t you tell me emotion? My God! That’s easy part! Now you see why I need you here? These other people don’t care.” He immediately started peeling off the water bottle’s sticker, because nothing scared Tommy more than having to pay someone for permission to use a logo. Tommy is probably the world’s single most copyright-obsessed human being who does not also have a law degree.
Sandy joined us on the side of the Rooftop set. He looked for a long time at Tommy’s water bottle before speaking.
“What’s this?”
“Water bottle,” Tommy said.
Sandy took in a lungful of deep, calming breath. “Yes,” he said. “I know. What are we doing with it?”
“I need to throw something, dammit. During scene.”
Sandy turned away, removed his glasses, sat down, and rubbed his eyes.
Tommy headed back to the outhouse, his water bottle in hand and his script hidden in his breast pocket. I sat down. Sandy stood by the monitor. “Action!” The door flew open and there was Tommy holding his water bottle and stepping out of the outhouse and hitting his head on the doorjamb so hard that it took twenty minutes to ice the bump and conceal it with makeup. I heard one of the cameramen say, desperately, “How are we ever going to get this? It’s impossible. We’ll be here forever.”&&OR UNDERSTAND THEM&&Not remembering is not as bad as not understanding what you wrote, in my opinion&&I have got to watch this movie.&&I can't even tell if this is a joke&&You know what weird token foreign kid every 90s show you have no idea where he's from?

I'm like 80% sure Tommy is the human avatar of that idea.&&It isn't or at least it wasn't. In the book Sestero somewhat roundaboutly claims that Tommy is from Eastern Europe, most likely Poland. IIRC he says that the name is like Tommy so it was probably Tomasz or something like that. His last name is completely made up. Tommy lived in France before coming to the US and speaks French. When he made it to LA he started selling little flying bird toys and became known as ""the Birdman"" and bird in french is oizeau, anglicize it a bit and you have Wiseau.&&[relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1400/)&&yeah its really painful to become famous solely on how bad you did something. We've all done embarrassingly bad attempts at projects before but this one is made fun of by everyone.&&He legitimately thinks people like it as a quality movie. At least, that's the impression I got from his AMA.&&It was the whole film. In LA they do a lot of test screenings of films, where you go watch an early cut and fill out a questionnaire afterwards with your opinions. It seemed like it was a pretty polished version of the film at the time, so I am surprised that it has taken so long to come to theaters. I'm looking forward to seeing what they changed since I saw it last. &&The funny thing is that Wiseau owned a few buildings in SF so the green screen was completely unnecessary 

edit: if you wanna know more about Tommy from an employee of 11 years then check out this podcast starting at around 12 minutes. http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/frotcast-220-the-room-with-former-tommy-wiseau-employee-aaron-barrett/&&Meanwhile, in San Francisco...&&Not just a green screen. A green screen while shooting outside.&&It looks like some dystopian industrial wasteland when they switch the shot to him and Mark&&Don't forget the physical impossibility of that ""staircase"" existing...  

To clarify: that is the outer corner of the building, so for him to be emerging *towards* us, the staircase must extend *out & away* from the viewer, and into a part of the building that doesn't exist. It's a staircase to nowhere. It's even more apparent in [the first moments of the scene](http://i.imgur.com/Gsj62Qe.jpg). He would have had to come up a ladder!  

Edit: to those proposing a spiral staircase, check out [this moment](https://youtu.be/BD-YZbeajeY?t=4m10s) (4m10s) - Mark heads *back and to the left* - that's no spiral staircase! &&Or that you can see that the shack he comes out of is empty and not a stairwell or any kind of roof access.

Like... it seems like this would've been harder than just filming on location?&&Yes, TONS of the audio was re-dubbed. I forget the reasoning, I think it was either bad equipment or some paranoia of Tommy's.&&Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) is extremely common and is used all the time in Hollywood films and you may have just never noticed it... it's noticeable here though because he is a bad actor and thus a bad voice actor.&&Yes, throughout most of the movie.&&It's a very poorly made film. So terrible they made this new one about it.&&Grab a few beers and watch it with your friends. It's so bad it's actually amazing.&&Ah the famous Matty-Matt&&The Departed was a very confusing movie for me also.&&Is this thread legit or just a bamboozle? My reaction would be the same either way but....&&/r/delusionalartists&&In many ways he succeeded in ways that a slightly more competent artist would have failed.  With a bit more talent he could have just made something boring that people would forget.  But you don't forget The Room and a lot of people genuinely love it.  What else matters?  Sure it's a bad movie but I enjoyed it more than something like X-Men apocalypse.

I'm thankful to Tommy that he made it.  Maybe it's not the movie he imagined in his head, but in some way I found it to be enriching.

&&Its the 'so bad its good' for people who actually like genuinely bad movies. The type of person who could think 'The Room' is genuinely profound still needs a movie to make fun of.&&After shooting Lisa’s tryst with Mark, Juliette had to film her love scene with Tommy. This took several days. A lot of productions close their sets during love scenes. Not Tommy’s. He opened the set, asking every member of the production to come in and “help out with lighting.” It started to feel like Tommy didn’t want the love-scene-shooting process to end. He delayed things for no reason and stayed naked far longer than was necessary. (When Tommy, wearing a towel, watched some playbacks with Todd Barron, he pointed at himself on the monitor and said, “Look at all these muscles.”) He made no secret of the fact that he was enjoying his physical contact with Juliette, who was obviously suffering between takes. I think half of the guys on the crew had to suppress every chivalrous impulse they had during filming to keep themselves from pulling Tommy off her—especially during the shot in which Johnny appears to be impregnating Lisa’s navel. In the end, Tommy was so pleased with the footage he shot of his love scene that he felt compelled to use it all in the final film, even going so far as to add an additional Johnny-Lisa love scene using recycled footage. Tommy assumed this would go unnoticed by audiences. It did not.



From the disaster artist book&&Yeah, I think Greg confirmed that in the book, it's been a few years since I read it.&&Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww&&I say stick with whatver works! of course, I haven't had sex in about 10 years, so what the hell do I know.&&I heard the actress didn't want to do it again either because she was so uncomfortable, but don't quote me on that.&&That's not the reason at all. In fact the film was surprisingly high budget and everyone was constantly surprised at how much money Tommy would spend on the film, for instance the norm is to rent a camera for the duration of the film but because of some strange confusion Tommy bought 2 brand new reasonably high end cameras for shooting the film. The reason why they didn't film a second scene was that the actress playing Lisa was so uncomfortable filming the first one that she refused to do the second&&There are genuinely terrible movies that I wouldn't want to see on a bad movie night. ""The Last Airbender"" is unwatchable, no matter how you approach it, for example. The ""Star Wars Christmas Special"" was so utterly dreadful that it went beyond ""so bad it's good"" to ""excruciatingly bad and painful to watch"".

The Room, however, is quite possibly the best movie ever made for such a movie night. It's the ""Citizen Kane"" of terrible movies. It's so bad and so absurd that it transcends into something that's almost perfectly enjoyable. Even Troll 2 had competent moments where it almost resembled a ""normal"" movie. There are none of those in ""The Room"".&&What about the movie about the murderous tire?  Rubber I think?&&I can kinda see it though. It starts off like a skinemax porno.&&The Room was our hit for bad movie night in college, too. Troll 2 and Manos Hands of Fate were close favorites, too.&&Yeah, Troll 2 wants a word with you.&&What's the terrible movie where Gary Oldman plays Matthew McConaughey's dwarf twin brother?

Edit: I found it. It's Tiptoes. It is a serious drama weirdly edited like a romcom.

The synopsis: 

>Carol (Kate Beckinsale) is an artist, Steven (Matthew McConaughey) trains firefighters. They've lived together for months and plan to marry soon, except that Steve's left out an important detail about himself and his chromosomes: his parents, twin brother, and many of his relatives are dwarfs. Carol learns this when Steve's brother Rolfe (Gary Oldman) drops by, the day after she discovers she's pregnant. Why hasn't he told her about his family? She calls on them, and they take her to their hearts. But tensions mount between the lovers as she believes he's ambivalent and angry about his family, and he thinks she's romanticizing the life and many health problems of little people. Can they get over these emotional barriers?&&I'll throw in Breathing Fire. It's your average 90s martial arts movie aimed at young adults, riding the Karate Kid wake. BUT...the plot of this movie is nothing short of amazing. I'll summarize as best I can.

The main characters are 2 teenage brothers in L.A. One is your typical 90s white kid with frosted spiky hair, his adopted brother is Data from The Goonies. They don't know this yet, but their father is a bank robber, with a whole gang of stereotypical criminals that help him pull off some giant heist. They put a ridiculous amount of gold bars in an old bank vault, and get this... before destroying the vault keys, they make a mold by **pressing the keys into a god damn pizza** and then cutting up the pizza so it takes all of them to reproduce the keys. So the rest of the movie, all of these guys are literally killing each other for a piece of pizza. Then the kids get involved, they learn karate from their uncle, who **SWORE he would NEVER do karate again. EVER!** and then use the stupid techniques they learn from him to take down this crime ring ultimately leading to their dad. Oh and also, in one pivotal flashback scene, we learn that the father ended up being forced to adopt the Vietnamese kid after accidentally shooting his mother in 'Nam, because those are the rules....and he named him.... fucking.....Charlie.


You can probably still find copies of it in dvd bargain bins, that's where I found it, back in like 2001, at a Circuit City for $5. I got it because Bolo Yeung was on the cover, and the only name listed, (we used to have Bolo parties, and none of us had heard of this one before) when in reality he's in the movie for about 30 seconds. Also, the resolution of this movie is about fucking 19p. Everything is really pixelated and weird looking, there is a 3-minute fight sequence in a night club where the screen is just black, you can't make out anything that is happening, and it has this bizarre 3-question trivia about the movie, which is the only Special Feature on the dvd.

Watch the first 20 minutes, if you aren't hooked by then, I'll be amazed.&&Dude you just described 3/4 of the movie.&&Yeah, idk if it was better or worse, but I saw it for the first time at a ""The Room night"" and it had all the stuff going on like people saying every line and throwing spoons and playing football in the aisles.

Goodness me I couldn't stop cracking up!&&The Room *is* genuinely profound. One of the goals of art is to communicate to an audience the thoughts and feelings of the artist - to allow the audience to experience, to some extent, what it is like to be the artist. And, by all accounts, The Room is a representative depiction of Tommy Wiseau's mind. Which is really fucking weird. 

It might utterly fail as storytelling, but on a sort of Freudian, portrait-of-the-artist level, it's incredible. &&

Side Note: [The opening monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1WSD_cnRbA) from Rubber is still one of my favorite intros from any movie.&&I really don't think I could watch Manos without Joel and the bots. It's too bad to watch.&&They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me!


Oh my ^Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood&&I'll admit it took me way too long to understand why the town was called Nilbog for how stupid it was. Also that popcorn scene, weird shit.&&Troll 2 - Plot: Goblins turn people into plants and then eat them.&&I absolutely LOVED how trashy Tiptoes was. The couch conversation scene where Gary Oldman is [VERY CLEARLY just in the couch with fake legs sitting on top...](#spoiler) Dear God. Everyone should totally watch it haha&&> there's kind of so much going on that you barely focus on the movie itself.

a blessing and a curse&&Don't worry about it.&&""...Is real thing?""&&That book is so funny. The opening chapter had me in tears. I've never laugh cried while reading a book before. The opening has Tommy and Greg going to an A list restaurant in LA. Tommy wouldn't let the valet park his car, because he didn't want him farting in it. Then Tommy pours a bottle of water on his head. To ""keep the poofy stuff down"". He's wearing two belts. One in the loops. And one hugging his butt to ""keep it up"" ... ""plus I like the way it feels"". Walking into the restaurant Tommy has wet hair and no reservations. The hostess scans her memory on how she should know who this guy is. Perhaps the drummer of Ratt? 
  
Omg. Read the book. So funny. And a page turner. &&I went back and checked out his AMA he did. Someone asked him why there was a dog in the flower shop. Tommy' s response: 


'I love dogs. And by the way, that was a real dog, from the owner of the flower shop! And I want to clarify this, the dog made $100. The dog was under contract.

I love animals.'



&&The movie seems dubbed over, so it is possible.&&it's like some kind of fucked up theatrical full-circle.&&[deleted]&&Well at least they're the writing team for Fast 9, right?&&I think the universe would simply implode&&That's not how biopics work. Lots of people have odd tics and cadences, but mimiking them perfectly takes the audience out of the movie. Watch the first 10 minutes of Jackie -- Portman got Jackie O's mannerisms and inflections down to a T, an amazingly precise performance, and it's completely awkward and distracting. It feels very obvious that she's acting and it takes you out of the story, despite perfect accuracy. That's why actors often tone it down (read Hoffman's discussion on Capote).

Also, Franco is not a complete heartless asshole. This is a movie about a real person, and duplicating his accent in this context would be the same as mocking it.&&But if he does, the movie may be interpreted as satire. &&He won my heart with this story.

Just goes to show if someone like this can bring so much joy to us anyone can&&Perhaps not for that scene, but he thought he was good enough to pull off a James Dean when he delivered this famous gem:

[Dean/Wiseau side by side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jRvgEwAGCw)&&While that's certainly true, if you spend ANY time on even the most minor of film sets it becomes instinctive to look for logos or designs that would be copyrighted and thus need to be removed. Especially if you're the Prop Master or in the Art department. &&Hello doggy &&I really don't know what to think of the dude. Sometimes it seems like he's in on the joke, and then other times not. Like, he even had a [short-lived Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lK-IOLbvxE) where he reviewed games with an alien who abducted him. And then he tries to shut down a documentary about him making his movie. He's either actually mentally impaired, or a super troll.&&Especially because this film has a big cast which could mean $$$ but outside of the internet, not a lot of people know about The Room. And even if you *do* know about the room, I'd say only a small percentage of those people would even go see a movie *about The Room*.

So it's between ""Is this gonna be on two screens and then Netflix?"" or ""Is this going to be all across the country.""&&That is actually a very good point, I wonder if that was partly why they chose to do it in front of a green screen.&&They did what he wanted to do.  He certainly didn't think anything through with that lens.  At one point he thought maybe he would be shown in a flying car because perhaps his character was a vampire.

There is no explanation for why those decisions were made.&&They set the green screen up outside in a parking lot, so their lighting still got fucked up.&&I'm convinced he's an old vampire awoke from hibernation around the '90s. It would explain his mysterious accent, pale skin, lifeless acting, unconfirmed wealth, fact he wanted green screen instead of being on the roof in direct sunlight.&&One of the DPs (Director of Photography) (The Room had 3, because all the DPs kept quitting) told Greg strait up he thought it was a money laundering scheme when Greg hired him.&&DB Cooper&&I need to know more!!&&Biggest and most expensive cities.&&He owned a retail company. Still mysterious, but I don't find it hard to believe that a man like Tommy can be successful. As weird and socially challenged as he is; he is very persistent, as well as determined. You know the old saying, right? &&He was extremely sucessful selling merchandise according to the Disaster Artist book.&&It's not that exciting. Tommy was a Polish immigrant who was involved in a severe car accident years ago which left him with an ABI and a large payout.&&TROLLI TRAIN&&I just ordered the book last night. Can't wait for it and the movie. Need to order The Room so I can get my sweet underweers. &&They shot in a parking lot surrounded by traffic. that's why all the roof scenes are ADR'd there was almost no befit to shooting that scene that way.&&Just look at it.   There is no way stairs could lead up to the door.   Only a ladder.&&No way. Tommy is so American! He plays football and has a hot blonde future wife! (/s if it's needed)&&He also forgot his lines and said the wrong lines. It probably got cheaper to have one sound guy ""fix"" stuff than sitting there reshooting on set. &&In the documentary *American Movie* Mark Borchardt erroneously calls it ""Additional Dialogue Recording.  (It's a common mistake.)

The reason I mention this particular instance here is because if you like *The Room* and *Disaster Artist* then you **REALLY** need to check out *American Movie*.  Mark Borchardt is the original Tommy Wiseau.

Juliette didn't mind the scene with Tommy but does regret going topless.


Source: I love this movie and book too much&&Do you have a source on that?  That seems to run contrary to what others are saying, that she was uncomfortable (which also seems to be supported by Sestero's book).  &&Just imagine. There is an entire alien race full of beings that look like Tommy Wiseau. And they have millions of little Tommy Wiseaus running around. And their ideal beauty standard is looking like Tommy Wiseau.&&So, Ted Cruz?&&Steven! They just got a new actor because Peter's actor left. I think my favorite section from The Disaster Artist is when Greg (Mark irl) writes that The Room is, in a way, about Steven. The complete lack of explanation, the uncomfortable manner in which the actor carries himself, and the bizarre transition from Peter to Steven really encapsulate everything about this movie.&&All those films with titles like that are made by one company to try and trick the ""ironic"" crowd into watching them.&&Horror movies that try too hard to be so bad it's good almost never work. Sharknado mostly worked.&&I couldn't agree more. Fucking fantastic. &&So you would advise me to watch The Room AND Rubber? 
Damn this sounds like an awful tv night.&&I get the impression that *BirdDemic* was an earnest attempt by misguided environmentalists to make a good movie with a strong message, but hampered by all the failings of an amateur team.

And one you didn't mention was Troll 2, which was definitely directed by a psychotic Italian guy who cared about his movie in all the wrong ways. You should watch the documentary [Best Worst Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRccOQjmVQ) to hear straight from the actors all about how the development there went.&&That's why I can't get into Sharknado and all those style films. A movie trying to be bad, and having celebrities asking to be in it, is far from the point of enjoying bad movies.&&My friends and I were all pretty sloshed up when we watched it. I've never laughed so hard in my life. &&That's like dental surgery without anesthetic.

It is literally unwatchable without riffers.&&You're my favorite customer!&&that's actually kind of adorable&&Yea, it's like trying to throw a baseball on your dominant arm as if you're throwing it with your less dominant arm.

Completely agreed.&&He has brought joy to a lot of people.  And I mean if it would have been mediocre no one would have been talking about it.  So he should be happy about how horrible it turned out.&&Oh my gah... I had no idea Tommy was referencing something there. This makes me feel even worse for the guy while laughing even more, lol&&Oh, no doubt. What I mean is I find it odd that the author seems to call him out for his obsession over it. Seems a totally rational thing to be concerned over.&&So anyway, how's your sex life?&&If I remember correctly from the book, it was a long time into filming that scene before Tommy knew that dog was real.&&[deleted]&&What the fuck did I just watch?&&Maybe it's the accent, but he always sounds like he's slurring his words. He either is constantly intoxicated or really does have some issues&&I honestly think he has brain damage from an accident he was in. &&Not a lot know but there are movie theaters in tons of cities that show The Room once a month. I go a few times a year myself. &&Honestly, having read the book, I'm pretty sure it had more to do with the fact that Wiseau would do anything if you told him it was what big hollywood studios did. So if someone told him that the major studios used green screens for backdrops, he would buy one in an instant. &&Huh. That actually makes sense...&&One of the original plans from the movie was to have Tommy Wiseau's character be revealed to be a vampire. He wanted to have a car float off the roof, showing that Johnny was a vampire the whole time. But if I recall correctly, couldn't get the stunt done and scrapped the plan entirely.

So you might be onto something there.&&Child of Nazi science experiment in Eastern Bloc that failed to be next Hitler. &&These are all very good points.  Also, he almost always dresses in black and wears sunglasses even indoors.

[Here's a video of him experiencing what it might be like to have a reflection.](https://vimeo.com/40382774)&&So does this make it the greatest money laundering scheme in history?  

They laundered millions and then ended up making even more millions from the scam product. &&Oh man.

In The Disaster Artist, Sestero wrote about how he had to talk Tommy out of including an extension of the Chris R. fight scene where Johnny's Benz would ascend from the rooftop and fly into the night sky, exposing that Johnny is actually a vampire. How Tommy's mind envisioned this fitting into the plot, we may never know.

Looks like they're keeping pretty close to the source material. &&Whoa..... was that Pennywise getting out of Patrick Hockstetter's fridge? The whole fridge/Patrick part was probably the most upsetting thing to me in the book, so them touching on that is spectacular. &&When Richie walk into that room filled with clowns.....
I'm way more hyped about IT than the dark tower. IT looks like it's following the source material fairly well &&Damn that was good. They're really staying true to the spirit of the book.

I love how they're incorporating the element of the adults apathy towards Derry's problems, and really showing the other issues that the Loser Club faces besides Pennywise.

A+ from me.&&""Everything floats down here.....

That run ends in September.&&It's eyes are yellow, like a beast, when It first shows up.

This is exactly how it goes down in the book. I'm very excited for this movie, if only for this scene in particular. How cool.&&Daaaaaamn this looks awesome.

Love that we got a lot of Pennywise in this trailer, but still have seen very little of him in action for the most part. And that voice! Weirdly shrill and childish...super creepy.

Also, on a side note, I really feel the small town vibe in this and it very much reminds me of how I pictured everything in my head while reading the novel. Seems like Muschetti nailed it.

Count me as hyped.&&Cant wait for the inevitable Cat in the Hat edition.&&Good thing I was taking a shit &&As a child who grew up on horror, this is my Harry Potter right here.

This movie will have The John Carter Effect where a lot of people will compare it to the things it inspired,namely Stranger Things.&&I want to believe the clown will just hand the kid back his paper boat because it's a good Samaritan. &&I look forward to watching this in my house at 2:00 in the afternoon with all the lights on and a blanket and the volume down really low. &&Could probably get a great deal on a house in that town. 

More seriously, this looks terrifyingly great. &&I love how they managed to make the ""you'll float too"" a lot more badass and sinister this time around. It's a great cryptic line.&&As someone who watched the original for the first time at age like 5 and continued to watch it during my childhood, I'm very ready for this movie.&&jesus this looks fucking terrifying. 

i remember reading the book and being absolutely consumed with how good it was, then finding out there was a movie and being let down when i watched it. dear god i hope this is good&&Everything I've seen so far from this film is looks great. It's looking to be exactly what I want from an IT adaptation. I really hope this doesn't disappoint, because I am 100% aboard the hype train.&&Well well well...  This looks absolutely terrifying.&&Good lord.  I don't do horror, I'm vaguely familiar with the novel, and I never saw the original, so this might be a little more intense for me, but I'm sitting at work and my office is well-lit, and the beginning of that trailer gave me anxiety more than the end.&&He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts.&&It's out of this world &&Derry has a terrible drainage system&&I think Mike Rowe did an episode of Dirty Jobs there once. &&The greatest, even, the best. &&when he grabs Bev he's as tall as the door, pretty freaky&&Seeing the kid get grabbed by something actually two times their size added to the creep factor quite nicely &&For a sec I thought you were talking about Alexander Skarsgård and was surprised he was the person playing Pennywise.

I hope there are no fake Maine accents in this movie. No one has ever gotten a fake Maine accent right in a TV show or movie.&&I'm wondering the same.  It appears we get a shot of Patrick real quick towards the end involving a flame (could be a makeshift flame thrower - like hairspray and a lighter).  I can only imagine the fridge is in reference to Patrick.  Pretty hyped&&*Oh man if they have his death it's gonna be terrifying.* God damn, I hate seeing horror films in the cinema but this is tempting me mightily.&&When you compare that shot with the shot of the kids in the house on Neibolt street, it looks like the same location. They could be switching stuff around, though, and have Patrick's fridge be in the house. It would sort of make sense that something so depraved would happen close to where It lives.&&[Here is an HD screencap](http://imgur.com/a/qMrgj)

I don't know how the scene in the book goes, but this looks like an old, unplugged, gutted fridge. In an abandoned house maybe?

Both trailers have been home runs so far.&&I loved watching the clown in back move to watch Richie... &&The apathy from the adults was the most interesting aspect for me in the book, all these massacres in Derry and nobody said anything about it.

I really liked that.&&R-Rated with ""Very adult themes.""  I'm very intrigued and hope they can pull this off.&&Right now I'm at an A- and it'll stay that way if Pennywise is *only* a clown for the entire movie.

I'm so glad productions like Stranger Things and Super 8 are bringing back that style. Perfect time for IT to be released for mass appeal.&&Henry Bowers basically looks exactly like how I pictured him in my head reading the book.&&https://youtu.be/ztxEHtrgTRg&&Did it float?&&IT was the first Stephen King and ""adult"" book that I ever read. I was in 6th grade so around 11 years old. I have loved everything horror and Stephen King since then. This looks so good. I can't wait!&&That demented noise that's been in every trailer that sounds like a clown horn is scary as fuck yo&&This looks so fantastically good that I'm afraid my expectations have gotten too high.

Love the red balloon across the skyline of the WB / New Line Cinema card.

Also had no idea Cary Fukunaga had a hand in the screenplay. My expectations! They're too damn high!&&I think that and Pennywises' voice were the best parts. He looks and sounds creepy and unsettling. &&This looks very creepy. Should be great. &&The background music is just brutally intense as well.&&If you have the time, read it. That being said, the audiobook is ***fantastic.*** Steven Weber is an awesome narrator. &&It's an exhaustively long story. Granted, it's a masterpiece. But still, a very long story. If you want to save time, I'd go for Audible, but maybe return to the book one day and read it anyway. 

EDIT: I am a meticulous and slow reader, so maybe an audiobook would be easier, not necessarily quicker, depending on your reading habits. &&The audible book is great. Im almost through it. &&IDK depends on your own reading statistics. I read it in a month but it could take some people a year&&Unfortunately, The Dark Tower is produced by Sony and It is produced by Warner Bros.  It's a shame tho because The Dark Tower explains a lot of mysterious things in King's books. Maybe Disney will buy everything in a couple years, create Stephen Kings Studio and start the King Cinematic Universe? &&Turtles all the way down&&Yeah. I'm really hoping Pet Sematary gets a proper, high budget reboot similar to this.  That is one of the best books I've ever read. The rollercoaster of emotions was something I've never experienced before or since. &&They should cast Seth Green as adult Tozier.&&I realized the other day that I had had zero interest in seeing this movie because the director disputes worried me. But then the first trailer came out a couple months ago. After that, I was fully on board. It's the trailer I'm most excited to watch in the theaters when it pops up too (which it has for two or three movies I've seen this summer)&&Wow, that second image is very eerie because of how his left eye is watching straight into your soul while his right eye isn't.&&#7 is more likely [some kind of hallucinated flashback to The Black Spot burning down than Pennywise himself. The outstretched arms reaching towards Mike are most likely people burning alive](#spoiler). &&That final screen grab with the kids in the house looks like it might be Pennywise as the [Teenage Werewolf](#spoiler).

In the book Bev, Richie, and Bill go see the 1957 movie [I Was a Teenage Werewolf](#spoiler). Maybe, along with the updated timeline, we'll get a nod to the kids having gone to see [Teen Wolf?](#spoiler)

Edit: a word&&And his eyes turn blue when he's talking to Georgie...it's those subtle things that give me loads of faith in this movie.&&Take it....ta.&&I hope Brendan is one of the forms It takes in part 2 to scare the adults. &&He turns up to help Stan when Pennywise attacks him as a mummy.&&Checking the comments to avoid spoilers seems like a bad idea.&&I wonder how they'll make it work tho. The tension in the books comes from them remembering their childhood while it happens. &&You could make the greatest horror movie ever but the marketing would have to focus on jump scares because that's what audiences expect from horror movie trailers these days. It sucks but it's inevitable. &&I'm with you there.  I know hollywood has to have it's cliches, but I really hope they don't sacrifice screen time just to build up jump scares because audiences hate exposition.&&I had that thought too about this trailer, but I'm hoping it's just marketing catering to the masses and that they've pretty much shown all the jump scares and/or those scenes aren't actually edited as jump scares in the movie.&&Trailers tease a lot of jump scares, because there's only so much you can do with a short trailer. I have no doubts this film will be dripping with dreadful atmosphere and tension, and that hopefully any jumps scares will be earned by great buildup, similar to The Conjuring films. Hopefully I'm not wrong.&&It'd be an amazing trailer if it didn't rely on the excessively loud steel-to-steel crossbar banging noises. If Pennywise shows up on screen I don't need to be reminded by a small nuclear explosion.&&""So, here we have a lovely little home. 3 bed, 2 bath, terrifyingancientclownmonster, and a *lovely* kitchenette!""&&Ninja turtle approved&&yeah didnt it flood or something in the books? i remember something like that being mentioned in the other SK book.&&I have a feeling this might be where the dad is being manipulated by penny wise.

If only they could just film every chapter and make a long series out of it. Haha &&I suspect a lot of the ""side stories"" from the books will be cut do protect run  time, but I think that the studios should 100% take advantage of them for promotion of the movies.

 Like, do Adrian's story separately but don't make it obvious that it's about IT until the reveal of the clown at the end. So basically a trailer unrelated to any scenes from the actual movie. Play it as a 5 minute TV spot or something. 

I feel like that would work as fantastic advertising AND be true to the book and its incredible world building. &&Adrian Mellon would technically be in the adult part of the story since that's what kicks off Mike Hanlon calling everyone back. &&Hopefully in this retelling, Eddie takes advantage of the Leper's generous offer.&&I imagined it as a regular house, but with like... Boarded windows. No rotting paint or anything.

I also pictured it in a neighborhood, at the end of a cult da sac&&http://i.imgur.com/DIkj8Qq.jpg&&It should be. It kicks the book off with a bang, and the movie should be the same. &&Sorry, what reports do you mean?&&After the first trailer where we finally got to see him in motion as Pennywise, any fears I had quickly went away. &&People were upset about it before we saw anything. It was similar to the initial response to Heath Ledger being cast as the Joker. Prior to the first trailer we had a handful of minor to major roles and nothing to indicate he'd make a good Pennywise. Then they showed his design and the response was ""WTF, that's awful!"", then we saw the first trailer and the complaining mostly stopped. &&He's no Tim Curry but that's ok. Tim Curry did an amazing job in the TV movie thing, so many fans have him as the standard for IT and no one else would live up to that. While this new one looks pretty clearly like it'll be different that doesn't mean it'll be bad.

I think of it kind of like jack Nicholson and Heath Ledgers playing the Joker. Very different takes but both really good. If Pennywise works like that I'll be very happy.&&He's going to nail the role. He put so much effort into it and apparently poured over the book while getting into the character.&&Seems so creepy when Pennywise does anything in this trailer. I'm so hyped for this.&&Hopefully. &&I loved that. Very creepy. &&[deleted]&&>Redditor for 7 years

I want to re-read it, because it's one of King's best, but my god is it disturbing.&&more like a Dark Duplex&&The original first novel was pretty thin stuff (it was actually a collection of five short stories that were originally published in magazines). Even with King's later revision/expansion, I don't think it breaks 300 pages. And the film looks like it's quickening certain plot turns by borrowing elements from later books (like the mansion doorway from *The Wastelands*).

I'm more concerned about the PG-13 element. I think Sony's trying to hard to make a franchise up-front when they could've made an R-rated movie with the courage of its convictions. The film cost $60 million to produce, which is a comparative pittance for a studio, so you wonder why they didn't just fucking go for it.&&IT definitely should &&All of the historical parts that fill in the background of It's history in Derry are my favourite parts of the book.&&I was thinking that, like, she sees Pennywise for just a split second flash, but then it's her dad.

Muschietti apparently took his script, then reshaped it, adding more scenes from the book. Also, it was R rated all the way through.

You can find Fukunaga drafts flying around online. 

Otherwise, I couldn't dream of a more perfect adaptation than this seems to be. Muschietti said they should have a script for the second part in January and enter production in the summer.&&You're not wrong. That's Patrick Hockstetter (although he's a lot more good-looking than he's described in the novel), and if they even include half of what's in the book about him he'll be a lot creepier than Pennywise himself.&&I've tried to get through the book for years , I'm just not a reader I guess. This audiobook was so great, though. Steven Weber did a killer job with it. All of Richie's voices were great and his stuttering is on point, which reminds me I haven't heard Bill stutter in any of these trailers yet.&&Yeah but you can have an audiobook going during times when you otherwise couldn't be reading like commuting, cooking, working out, doing mindless work etc.

""It"" does that. He's taking his powers from kid's fears. This is the basics and it would be quite long to explain you everything in a reddit post, so you probably should go on a Stephen King's wikia.

The only time (in the book) anyone is lured is Georgie, and even he feels uneasy and unsure about Pennywise.

In the book it actually states how during a town parade, the adults sort of shy away from Pennywise without even realizing they are doing it. They act ""as if they smell something bad"" and babies cry at the sight of him. At no point is he supposed to feel like a normal, friendly clown.

I was wondering why there were no scenes of them as adults.&&Yeah, the turtle is a Guardian of the Beam.&&Yep, and since he's a sociopath so detached from reality, he has very few real ""fears,"" so It doesn't really know what to turn into, resulting in this amorphous thing of constantly shifting parts and pieces.

Pennywise is friendly-ish exactly once in the book, and it's this scene.
It is a straight up predator that enjoys the hunt. It intentionally terrifies It's prey because it makes the meat taste better, and this is why It takes the form of what scares a particular child the most. Pennywise, along with the rest of It's forms are meant to scare the shit out of It's target.

Tim Curry always gives a great performance in whatever he does, it was unique to him, but the mini series Pennywise was way off from the source material. Bill's Pennywise appears to be MUCH closer to what King wrote and will bring the terror.&&He did look like a creepy clown in the book. He doesn't need it to bait kids. He has no trouble killing them in the book with out looking like a clown. King actually chose the clown because kids are afraid of them, not to try and lure them. &&I don't understand why people always say this. The clown was supposed to simply make kids drop their guard at first. Every description of the clown quotes it as off or menacing. He's never supposed to look friendly. I just got through reading the book for the 3rd time and this time I even looked for instances where he was described as a fun clown. He isn't and it's quite the opposite. &&IT doesn't lure them. It terrorizes them because It thinks the fear makes them taste better. That's why It doesn't bother with adults, because kids scare much easier.&&We all vote down here!&&None for Gretchen Wieners &&I ❤️ Derry!&&http://i.imgur.com/zy9qkA8.gif&&Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Penny the Wise?&&O͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡╮༼;´༎ຶ.̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̸̨̨̨̨̨̨̨̨̨̨̨̨.̸̸̨̨۝ ༎ຶ༽╭o͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡͡  🎈&&✋ 🎈 popping&&My thought process on the whole ""bang hookers"" idea is that I would live with far more stress if I didn't know what number I was in the chain, if that makes sense. If I have to live my whole life looking over my shoulder, I want to know its for a good reason and not a guessing game. I would simply go to the cops, drape a blanket or splash paint on the creature say ""trap this! please!"", everyone would freak out, we'd put it in a jail cell and my movie would be over and anticlimactic. &&Banging hookers means the hookers probably won't last long, and then it comes back for you, only this time you won't know when it happens.

&&Not if this one sells big. Then we are talking yearly sequels Saw style&&27 Years a Clown&&See the turtle of enormous girth...&&I am glad to hear them bring up the second half often. It would have bothered me to only get half of the story. I'd say that there's no way this isn't successful so should only be a matter of time before they cast the adults :) &&I need to read It and the Dark Tower series again.&&Oh but he did have a fear. Leeches. As a psychopath, he's got a good case of ultra narcissism that makes the idea of losing body matter really unfathomable. He didn't like the idea that worms would take his blood. &&Car battery linked to a woman's nipples? No problem. Power drills? Axe to the head? Five pages of exposition describing Patrick's morning routine and why Huey Lewis is awesome? I can do that.

Homeless dude and his dog? Can't skip that shit fast enough.&&and eye!&&Dark Microapartment in Tokyo&&Dark Reasonably Priced Single in a College Town&&Having just finished the series, I have no idea how they are going to incorporate any of the themes or archs into a cohesive narrative based on what I've seen in the trailers.

I have no intention of seeing the movie until the dust settles.

It seems like a YA re-imagining.&&Wont do ya any good to run BEVVY!&&>“I beat you because I wanted to FUCK you, Bevvie, that’s all I wanted to do, I wanted to FUCK you, I wanted to EAT you, I wanted to eat your PUSSY, I wanted to SUCK your CLIT up between my teeth, YUM-YUM, Bevvie, oooohhhhh, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY, I wanted to put you in the cage ... and get the oven hot ... and feel your CUNT ... your plump CUNT ... and when it was plump enough to eat ... to eat ... EAT...” 😒&&Nah, it is the most bizarre event in the book and, even after reading tons of people defending it, I still think it was unnecessary, uncalled for and nothing would be lost by ignoring it ever happened.&&They had *one* job... &&Some child casting forums were discussing it back during pre-production a year or two ago. &&Nope, highly unlikely. King's overly explicit train scene isn't in line with Fukunaga who likely wanted to draw a parallel between Pennywise and sexual abuse as a perceived loss of innocence that children had little to no control over and resulted in distrust and distancing of other adult figures (i.e., Pennywise is unseen by adults, as if a child telling an adult of sexual assault can be overlooked and misconstrued as fabrication).

Or, it could simply have been WB not giving Fukunaga the control that he wanted, child abuse notwithstanding. &&The ending of his draft is terrible.  &&The sheep fucking and masturbating part are made up. There is no version with those scenes. &&I think the second movie is the adult timeline.&&Just go for 2x or 3x, and enjoy having a chipmunk read it!&&I'll warn you now. To go down the rabbit hole you need to read the Dark Tower series and about 2/3 of King's other works. Cinematic universe? This dude got his own literary universe. &&You should read it, but keep in mind that's actually a small part of the story, mostly in the back story. There are a couple BIG references to other King books in the main story of TDT, but most of it is just connections and explanations.&&Bev's dad was a tough part. Especially him chasing her through Derry, the shit he was saying... Ugh. &&For me, the most horrific part was reading about the psychopathic kid(I want to say Patrick?) who suffocated his baby brother.  That part made my stomach turn.&&Absolutely agree. It was so disturbing.&&[deleted]&&Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!?!&&Man that was so disturbing to read I loved it though haha&&And thousands, *thousands* of balloons covering the underside of the bridge. So many, in fact, you couldn’t even see the underside of the bridge; just a flowing wave of bright balloons. &&Looks like the Cat in the Hat from the infamous film adaption.&&I read the novel years back and am still truly fascinated with the amount of detail King put into It's history and all the mythology behind It. &&>I actually chose the clown because kids are afraid of them, not to try and lure them.

Stephen King?&&I have a feeling most of those people haven't read the book. Just my guess though.&&We all down vote here?&&Cease all Coco functions.&&If they don't make that into a shirt they've missed a marketing opportunity.

Edit: As pointed out below. Put a Balloon instead of a heart. There you go marketing people. Do that. That is hilariously terrifyingly awesomely appropriate.

Edit: Well damn a shirt does exist. Thanks people downthread.&&I 🎈Derry&&It's not a story the people of Derry would tell you&&(ง’̀-’́)ง 🎈  &&💥&&I think this would be a pretty effective plan for keeping the It Follows thing at bay:

* Drive to an airport a few hundred miles away, let's say Chicago O'Hare. This gives you a bit of time before It catches up to you.

* Get on a flight to somewhere very far away, let's say Thailand.

* While in Thailand, pay to have sex with a high-end sex worker whose clientele is made up with well-off foreign tourists.

* It in the meantime is walking west towards the Pacific ocean, part of what will be a years long walk to Thailand along the bottom of the ocean floor. But wait, a tourist from England slept with that Thai sex worker, and then flew home. Now It has to turn around and start walking towards the Atlantic.&&Well, if you banf a hooker on another city, it'd give her enough time to spread it further around.&&His laugh is hilarious now, especially because his arm jerks as he says it &&Dad clown!&&God I hope not&&On his shell he holds the earth. &&I wonder what the actual monster will look like in the second part.&&If I recall correctly, he was a hardcore believer in solipsism, whether he knew it or not, which is the belief that your own consciousness is the only thing that can be known to exist. Which is why he had no problems with killing animals or his baby brother because to him they were basically NPCs in a video game, also because he was batshit crazy.

Also he jerked off the main bully and almost gave him a blowjob. I didn't see this mentioned in this thread since the gangbang overshadows this but I remember reading this part when I was 10 and being shocked.&&Interesting.   I was reading about psychopath speech patterns and it said they tend to focus on basic physical needs and pleasures as opposed to caring about family, friends or dreams.&&Dark bungalow&&This really seems like the best idea. From what *I* can tell we have Jake, Roland, some ""war"" between Roland and Flagg, Doorkeeper, Algul Siento, Beambreakers, Beamquakes, Richard Sayre, The Dixie Pig and the lobstrosities (the cameo I mention). Again, this is just from what I can see. The director clearly has vision but I don't think Sony feel the same, they're trying to kick-start a PG-13 universe in a 95 minute movie with *way* too much things going on in that time. They should have done the TV show first and movie second. &&Was this from when she returned as an adult and is confronted by the illusion of her father?&&sounds like /r/indianpeoplefacebook&&I beat you 😢😢😢😢 because I wanted to FUCK 🍆🍆💦💦 you, Bevvie 😍😍 that's all💯💯💯 I wanted to do, 😝😝 I wanted to FUCK you 🍆🍑 I wanted to EAT you 🍴🥄😚 I wanted to eat your PUSSY😹😹😹 I wanted to SUCC 😙😙😙 your CLIT up between my teeth, 😀😀😀 YUM-YUM , Bevvie 👌👌 ohhhhhhhhh, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY, 🌯🌯 I wanted to put you in the cage😏😜 and get the oven hot 🤡🤡🤡🤡 and feel your CUNT 🍑🍑🍑 your plump CUNT 😝😝🍆🍆💦💦💦💦💦💦 and when it was plump enough to eat... to eat.. EAT 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🅱🅱🅱🅱🅱🅱&&Yeah, I mean, I understand the metaphor King is going for about loss of innocence or something to help them defeat It but, it's like, c'mon, there are better metaphors than pre-teens having sex in the sewer.&&I think it was a mixture of both. His script was apparently very graphic. &&Can confirm. Am still tumbling down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's multiverse. I didn't realize how connected everything was until reading ""Eyes of the Dragon"" led to The Dark Tower series, then on and on.... you start to follow the characters or towns and it's all 19 from then on.&&Sounds like I've got a winter reading list&&The kid who sees that and later has nightmares about ""Mr Marsh turning into a spider inside his clothes"" . . .&&IT pollutes the minds of adults. &&Yep, that was Patrick, who also stuffed animals into a refrigerator and let them die there&&God, everything about Patrick freaked me the fuck out. All the way from his habits, personality, to how he died. Fuck. Those. Bugs. I hate mosquitoes with a  passion, and you're telling me IT conjured up WORSE VERSIONS OF THEM?&&Killing Patrick may have been the only good thing Pennywise ever did.&&I legit cried reading that part. I stopped reading the book for a good couple of days. Patrick suffocating his baby brother was too much for me to handle. :(&&His brother, the puppy... Pretty much every scene involving that kid disturbed me.&&The dog.&&Loved the book, but man... [The Patrick Hockstetter stuff with his brother and then those animals... That was tough to read.](#spoiler)&&I fucking love the book; I actually stole it from the school library after my first read at 12 years, haha. 
Admittedly, reading it at that age, and in the middle of winter no less, was a terrible decision. 
And, a lot of stuff went a bit over my head at the time, which didn't stifle the books terrifying effect on me. 


This movie looks absolutely fantastic to me, but I don't think I can find the balls to watch it. >.<&&I can't freaking wait to see that shot. With the new cgi capabilities, I can imagine it looking really surreal, and mesmerizing. I picture it so clearly in my head.&&You mean [this one](https://youtu.be/ztxEHtrgTRg)&&Oh me too! It's fantastic. I wonder if we will get a chance to see the ""birth of It"" scene in the movie &&How about a paper hat with a flower that says I❤️Derry?&&But with a red balloon instead of a heart. &&🎈（ﾟдﾟlll）&&You're a monster&&The director of the movie actually addressed this. He flat out said, if you have the money, this creature wouldn't be hard to get away from. He even drew out a plan similar to yours. 

He said that the creature is a pretty specific horror and it's aimed at young people and poor people. People who can't afford to just jump on a plan and fly to God knows where. &&The thing wasn't stupid so it would probably just hop on a plane.&&While I hate to say this, the writer explained that creature would just board a plane or a ship if it had to cross an ocean.&&The director of It Follows has said that the thing could theoretically follow you on a plane. As they say in the movie: ""it's slow, but it's not dumb.""&&I've actually mathed it out and assuming it walks at 2 miles an hour it would only take about a half a year to walk half way around the earth. Assuming it never stops of course. You really don't get as much time as you think.&&But if she spreads it to some other guy..... once it kills that guy. Its back on the hooker. Its not a permanent solution.&&Then he spins that toy&&No Franchise is safe&&See the turtle ain't he keen...&&I can still remember people not loving the design in the 1990 version, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. I recently watched ""Mama"" for the first time so I really trust this director to come up with something good.&&You are correct. Read it again a few months ago to have it fresh in mind for this movie, and Hockstetter believes he is the only thing that actually exists.&&Oh yeah. I forgot about that part ಠ_ಠ It was kinda funny, because Henry was super into it for a while before he snapped out of it and was like ""miss me with that gay shit fam"". Then he threatened to kill Patrick if he ever told anyone. &&I've read a ton of King's books and I think Hockstetter is the most terrifying character I've come across.  Him thinking he is the only real being in the world in addition to him snuffing out his baby brother out of fear he too may become real made for a very unique unsettling character.  &&Read about psychopath brain imaging patterns too. Dr. James Fallon. Turns out the psychopathy we're familiar with is really a combination of certain brain physiology AND trauma&&I think a TV series would have been absolutely the better choice. The world building, narrative, and character arcs can't really fit into a movie, even a movie franchise. I think it needed a Game of Thrones esque approach with the first seasons building the world and introducing everyone and ending up in a sort of frenzied coming together at the end of the series.&&I was genuinely surprised when they announced the movie.

Done correctly, and you could either have a PC nightmare, or a well balanced narrative in regards to the Drawing of the Three.

Right out of the gate you're tackling, neglectful parents, child suicide, ""*reverse*"" racism, opiate addiction, and untreated mental illness.

Then I saw the trailer and was *whelmed*.&&I believe so, during the flashback scene. It's been a decade since I've read *It*, but that is the kind of book that sticks with you.&&Fuck's sake&&Oh my god, that passage was so creepy when I read it, and now I'm only going to be able to think of it in goddamned emojis&&It wasn't even sex. They ran a train on the girl in order for them to become less disoriented and find a way out of the sewers.&&I mean when you're as high as balls as he was there might not have been a better option in his head at the time&&> loss of innocence or something [...] there are better metaphors

Like beating a homeless guy to death with a hammer.&&Well, yeah, he had originally wanted to push the R-rating as hard as he could. I mean, the novel is a hard R by any standard since it essentially revolves around a god-like entity who brutally kills children. &&Some but i always got the impression the exact extent of ITs responsibility and people just being shitty was blurry. 

Bev's father was a piece of shit without a boogeyman to blame it on. It's a thing I've always liked about the book. &&They weren't even mosquitoes, they were FLYING LEECHES&&Something appropriate about the most affecting thing from a horror book about a supernatural killer being just a human. &&I seriously choke up every time I think about/read that part. Poor Mr. Chips. :(&&well that was amazing. &&[deleted]&&Hold up. How'd he dodge the first public works sign but not the second?&&They're planning on it in part 2! Producer confirmed it. &&Everyone is talking about flying around the world banging hookers, but we all die sometime, and no one is talking about going out in the best way possible, by freaking everyone out when you win James Randi's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge via getting mauled to death by an non-empirically-observable monster in a controlled laboratory setting.&&> He said that the creature is a pretty specific horror and it's aimed at young people and poor people.

it follows has gotta be the first actually liberal horror movie. the villain is an ancient conservative being, with nothing but time at its disposal, that directly punishes young people and poor people for having sex. basically all the really ugly shit about the slasher genre itself deliberately (which is the important part) personified as a singular thing.&&It did seem to learn, like how it was on the rook in that scene because she wouldn't trust anything coming from the door.&&That still raises so many questions (not a bad thing).  How does it know where the planes are going and when they depart?  Can it read English?  How did it learn?  



But most importantly: does this imply a potentially hilarious scene of the monster reading airline schedules and patiently waiting in an airport for its flight?&&Literally almost 0 rules of the monster are established in the movie.  Theoretically the monster just appears within a certain distance once your number is up.  So the whole bang people continents away certainly doesn't help.  Also boarding a plane takes a hell of a long time.  If it manages to get on the plane you're fucked.&&When IT FOLLOWS kills the guy the hooker fucked it has to go a long distance to the hooker that has already fucked another guy who probably fucked another hooker the next night and she fucks someone else the next day who takes a flight overseas and fucks somebody, etc..

Once you fuck a foreign hooker thousands of miles away you pretty much are done and don't have to worry about it ever again. 

My question is what happens where everyone in the sex chain is dead. Does it just go away?or start a new sex chain?&&IT:3, It happened again.&&All things serve the fuckin' Beam&&Yea, the 90 spider monster with the deadlights left a little to be desired.&&On your point of what they could tackle, if they had done that for a TV series picked up by something like HBO, Netflix, etc that could have been amazing if mature. They're not going to hit their mark with the movie at all. &&Can't find it right now but maybe someone out there has it saved but I remember a thread from a month or two back that linked to a parents of children actors subreddit where they were discussing the casting for IT back when it was the old director and apparently the gangbang was still in the movie at that point and Bev's dad was going to be more explicit in sexually abusing her.&&I think It exacerbates what's already therre&&IT was like a sickness on Derry. It affected most people in town including Bev's dad but after the first battle at Neibolt Street IT went full offencive, giving Henry the knife and turning Bev's dad from an angry abusive father to a crazed violent sexual predator. Bev remarks on the change and that it ""was not her father in there.""&&Oh yeah... ಥ_ಥ&&Fuck! I haven't read the book. Don't know how I thought this would go. Time to stop scrolling the comments.&&OH YEEEAAHH&&Pretty sure it's more terrifying than the actual IT trailer, and not because the IT trailer isn't terrifying on its own.&&Because he's like five and it's perfectly reasonable for him to be mostly mentally retarded.&&Yeah, the entire other half of the book when they're adults isn't in this movie.&&You could make a similar point about Cabin in the Woods.  Disdain for the young along with dehumanizing and forcing them to fit into specific, tropey roles.&&IT 4; Oh, shIT&&It 7 - It is what It is&&Alien --> Aliens

It --> Those&&It 2: Can Happen To You&&Oops, I did IT again&&Exactly. Everything that came before that moment was terrifying, but the payoff just wasn't there in a satisfying way.&&Here's some information regarding the original (and cancelled) script.

>Stan is the first to encounter IT in the form of a naked woman who emerges from a puddle of menstrual blood. It’s a moment that feels very reminiscent of The Shining: “ANGLE FROM BEHIND her as she steps out of the water, towards him.  The naked woman’s back is full of sores and bleeding, her butt shredded and rotten.”

>Beverly gets dressed up for Stan’s Bar Mitzvah; her father is turned on by her prettiness and attempts to rape her (again, most likely under the manipulative force of Pennywise).  After Stan’s Bar Mitzvah, the town is consumed in a storm as the well-armed Losers Club ventures into the sewers. They’re followed by the Bowers Gang who, led by Travis, plan on killing them all.

>The Losers are thrust back into the sewers, which are being flooded by the relentless storm raging above. They fear drowning, but Beverly takes each one of her male companion’s faces between her hands: “One by one the kids shoot out of a STORM PIPE into the PENOBSCOT RIVER, just like Georgie’s paper boat. They pop up like tops, blinking owlishly against the daylight. The sky is blue.  The storm has passed.”

So, yeah, Fukunaga had no intention of including that scene, if this is the real script. It really does just follow the machinations of the novel. I mean, King made it clear that Bev's dad was sexually abusing her. Fukunaga planned to translate that to film too, I guess.

Nice.&&So glad they are finally establishing that the lightning powers come from **THOR** not the hammer.  Mjolnir is just a focusing agent.

Also that shot of Thor and Loki shooting up a place like asgardian scarfaces looks cool as hell.&&Is that Karl Urban lookin' bad ass in the background?  

Edit: Yes it is! Really enjoy Urban's roles like Vaako and Dredd, really looking forward to this now.&&Cate Blanchett looks amazing!&&Speaking. Hulk. I've waited 10 years for this.&&I have so much faith in Taika, this is going to be great&&This movie looks fucking insane. Love the Synths in the trailer music.
Surtur, Hela, The fall of Asgard, Fenrir, AND somehow planet hulk in all of that.
And Hela confirmed goddess of Death

What the hell else do you have planted in this movie Marvel?&&THOR! AAHHHAAAAAA! SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE!&&the hulk seems hulkier&&I am so glad they changed the general feel of Thor's movies and are incorporating Guardians of the Galaxy's retro aesthetic. Thor was never about facing grounded, realistic enemies so just going full ham and embracing the over the top spectacle in a self-aware way looks like the right move
&&I was wondering why the song sounded so familiar. Turns out it was in Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number.

AND it just looks like a great time at the movies.

Who would have expected that a third Thor movie has the potential to be the best MCU movie?&&More like Asgardians of the Galaxy&&Yo, who is Hulk's barber?&&So will Hela be the Lady Death that Thanos wants to impress?

Also it looks fucking amazing&&Who would've thought THOR is shaping up to the be most visually gorgeous comic book movie of 2017?&&When humanity finally legitimately enters the larger galactic community in the MCU, it's going to be a surprisingly smooth transition.

""HAHAHA HUMANS, WELCOME TO AN INSANE WORLD OF PAINTED BACKGROUNDS AND LASERS AND SHIT WHERE EVERYONE IS SCREAMING ALL THE TIME!""

""Oh cool, so like the eighties. Okay.""

""WHAT?""

""Got any space-cocaine?""

""WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?""&&There were some absolutely beautiful shots in this trailer.  Things that would have never made it into Marvel movies from a few years ago.

Spider-Man had a few interesting shots that made it feel different, I'm glad to see Marvel starting to take some risks.

Edit:  too be clear I meant risks regarding cinematography, not in terms of building a cinematic universe&&I just want to say, I love how retro/synthwave music is getting a bit mainstream lately.&&Hela **twice** mentions she's the goddess of *Death* in the trailer.

And Thanos, anybody that has read the comics, knows he's got a chubby for Death itself. And in the comics Death is an actual ""person"". 

I've thought for a while, and this makes it look like a certainty, they're going to make Thanos infatuated with Hela for the MCU adaptation come Avengers Infinity War. Which will work as having him lust over bones in a cloak might not translate well to this series. 

Glad to see Fenrir and Surtur getting some screen time. Finally building more on the Thor mythos and embracing its insanity. I wish Thor didn't happen so early in the MCU, his early movies Marvel seems almost embarrassed by the premise of the character. Now after audiences are embracing the dorky nature of the MCU, with Ant-Man Strange and GotG they finally seem to be unleashing the potential of Thor.

Skar with 2 M16s? He's holding that bridge! Will be an incredible scene to finally see. 

Hulk is talking, but not like Grey Hulk talking. Plus he reverts to Banner still. So they aren't going completely Planet Hulk with the guy. He won't be getting those nanobots that keep him as Hulk full time but able to talk like a regular person. 

Overall the tone and humor seems decent, which I'm not surprised being directed by Taika. I just hope it's not 2 hours of yukks the way GotG2 was, it kept undercutting any attempt of tension emotion or heart away with bad forced humor.  

Some of the shots were gorgeous, namely the Fall of the Valkyries scene. This might end up being the best looking MCU entry to date.

*edit** Also, as a fan of the game Hotline Miami 1 & 2 it was great to hear [*In The Face Of Evil* by Magic Sword](https://youtu.be/-h5snZTfoEA) used for the trailer. &&I'm curious to learn how Hulk got captured, though, and what does Dr. Strange have to do with this, as shown in the post-credits scene.&&Hard to believe this trailer actually had me anticipating Ragnarok more than I already did... damn.

The Thor/Hulk (Banner) banter is just pure win. &&It looks like they just made Ruffalo play his adorable self rather than Bruce. I can dig it. &&Now I know why Thanos wants to bone Death&&The color palette for this movie will be what separates it from the rest of the Marvel movies. This seems visually breathtaking. &&Am I glad they didn't do that 5-second trailer trailer at the start that so many trailers do nowadays.&&""I am putting together a team.""&&I wasn't so sure with the director (love his other movies but Thor is such a big name. 

This trailer fucking delivers. 

We got mother fucking surtur, hulk SPEAKING, thor actually using his god damn powers for once and fenrir?(or a big ass dog). god damn im hyped&&Thor and Hulk are so great together!&&Thor: Can we be Guardians of the Galaxy?

Marvel: No 

Thor: Pleeeeeease.

Marvel: Fine.&&When they high five Banner uses his palm and Thor tries to fist bump. Nice touch. &&If there's Fenris Wolf and Hela do you think there might be Jormungandr?&&TMW you realise those silly shorts about 'Team Thor' were actually a massive hint about what's in the real movie.&&This has got to be marvels best year yet.  Thor looks like it can take home awards on costume design, alone.  Black panther looks equally amazing.  Guardians 2 looked amazing as well.  Everything idea amazing,  marvel is amazing! 

Give me the godamn infinity wars trailer, now. &&Holy shit everything about this looks amazing. Thor has been my least favorite franchise out of the MCU but it seems that they'll sway my opinion. Cast is great. Visuals are great. And damn does it look like we're going to see some cool ass action sets&&[MFW I watch a new Thor trailer](https://i.imgur.com/PU9hWSw.gifv)&&Holy shit that last shot of Surtur was absolute hype!&&These MCU movies are unstoppable now ""What if we just make everything fun and exciting and awesome to look at, and don't do anything boring or repetitive anymore?"" It's that simple.&&Last scene looks like Maui jumping toward Te Ka in Moana.
&&yes please have hulk start to talk more &&Wow! Looks so much better than the other two Thor movies. I like the first two but this, this is what we've been waiting for with Thor.&&Wow. I never thought id be this excited for a Thor movie. I hope the music in the movie is as good as this trailer.&&Whoever has been making these Thor 3 trailers should be given a higher pay grade.  I had no interest in Thor 1 or 2, but the Thor 3 trailers (both of them so far) have made me really excited.&&if this is going to be like buddy cop movie with hulk and thor ima love it &&Hulk talking&&I'm there for Hulk vs Fenrir&&JL trailer, Thor trailer, Captain Marvel news, DC film slate, Mothra teaser, Stranger Things 2 trailer, god today was great.&&Ah fuck... This looks kind of dope.&&HULK VS SUTUR MY BODY IS READY&&Hulk fighting Thor, then fighting Fenris... then punching out **Surtur**.

>***VALHALLA, I AM COM-I-I-I-I-IIIIIINNNNG***&&Some of the imagery in this trailer is fucking gorgeous. It's like *300* or *Immortals* level. &&Whats up with Banners voice when he says ""where are we""&&I can't wait for hulk and drax banter in infinity war &&Do we think this is the ""Death"" that Thanos will be trying to impress?&&Lol right? Greatest of the nine realms my ass. &&""We don't want to keep two Infinity Stones close together here in Asgard. Because uh... because they are that powerful.""

""It's cause you guys can't defend your home for shit, isn't it?""

""....yes."" &&Got that Gladiator hair cut.&&Hulk's hair like raging fire&&Hulk giving Thor a run for his money as most handsome avenger &&He went to the Dominican Barber Shop.&&That final shot was mesmerizing.  Hulk smash Balrog!&&I'm guessing that's going to be Thor's arc in the movie: he loses his hammer in the first act along with his confidence, he gets a glimpse of his real power during the fight with Hulk, then he goes full Thunder God against Hela in the finale.&&""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""  implies that they were always Thor's powers, not the hammer's.  Odin's enchantment just denied Thor his own powers. &&It was annoying when people would say ""but his hammer has all his powers"". If his hammer has all his power, then where do Loki and Odin get theirs? Thors badass without the hammer too. It not only helps him to focus his power into, but the hammer does have powers of its own and enhances Thors own power.

Then people will say ""but why doesn't he use all that power in the first place?""

Because he's not a psycho.&&I think Karl Urban is destined to feature in all nerdy film franchises.

As someone who loves the films but doesn't have a lot of comic background, what's the deal with talking Hulk?

 They're just doing it very slowly. 2 steps forward, one back. Doctor Strange was insane visually but a very basic plot and story beats. I'm hoping Thor is wild from start to finish. &&> I'm glad to see Marvel starting to take some risks.

The only reason Marvel is big is because they have taken a shit-ton of risks. Without risks the whole cinematic universe craze might not have happened. They even risked GoTG with the guy who made Scooby-do one and two.


Edit: TIL a lot of people love the Scooby-do movies.&&Kinda came back with Stranger Things, there's some in Ragnarok and in the new Blade Runner so hopefully it stays a bit. I love the vibe in movies and shows especially.&&In the comics, don't Deadpool and Death have like a relationship? 
&&she does get a face once he gets all the gems and she makes him a throne and shit&&> Hela twice mentions she's the goddess of Death in the trailer.
> And Thanos, anybody that has read the comics, knows he's got a chubby for Death itself. And in the comics Death is an actual ""person"".

Anyone can call themselves a ""god"".  Loki called himself a god in Avengers.  It doesn't mean when you die in the MCU you visit Hela in the afterlife.  &&From the live blog.

The Frost Giants lasted about 3 seconds, the Dark Elves, while wreaking some havoc, were fought off, and really, how well would anyone fare when attacked by the Goddess of Death? Considering how well Earth would fare against these types of opponents if the Avengers weren't around, I'd say Asgard has earned its title of ""Greatest of the Nine Realms"" just by being alive at this point.&&Three at best&&I'll tell you what, apart from Hela and Karl Urban's character, the hair in this movie looks great.

I guess a movie about a calm Dr. Banner is coming up soon. &&Yeah but a lot of people still think that Thor's powers come from the Hammer.

Never know. There is a TV series being planned: [Judge Dredd: Mega City One](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6873692/) in the works, and they want Karl Urban to star. But it's a long way away, and still in the conceptual stages. Hope it happens.&&Don't forget he also played multiple roles in Xena: Warrior Princess.  That's some deep nerd cred.&&He was also basically Doomguy in that terrible Doom movie.&&Now that Hugo Weaving is getting old, Karl Urban can fill his shoe.&&All I want is skurge at gjallerbru.

SMASH!"" only holds us over for so long...&&I remember there was a moment where two characters were trying to figure some science out, and Hulk just spouts the answer nonchalantly. It may not be like merged Banner/Hulk from the comics, but it goes to show that they share more than the same body.&&I guess at the panel they said he will have the vocabulary and intellect of two year old, since he's been perma Hulk since Age of Ultron. &&It's been a *long* time, but from what I remember, in the 90's they ran an arc where Banner's brains were merged with Hulk's strength/body, so he was permanently in Hulk form, but was intelligent and articulate. The Marvel Cinematic Universe picks and chooses what it likes from the comics canon though, so who knows what they'll do to explain this in *Ragnarok*.&&Whatever the explanation is, I would bet it happens in the film, because from the first trailer, we see Thor say ""Oh I know this guy, he's a friend from work!"" in the gladiator ring, but there is clearly a fight, and Bruce doesn't remember it. So I wouldn't be on Hulk being articulate and level headed when the movie starts. This is probably setting up for Hulk being an even stronger asset in Infinity War.&&""This is Room where Hulk SMASH!!!""&&That's the Child Welfare lady on the left of Jeff Goldblum at 1:33.

shoutout to /r/outrun if you dig the music in the trailer&&Small part from what I understand.  Probably about the size of Falcon's part in ant-man.&&Probably in the beginning. Since Loki is on the throne, I imagine Thor finds out and drags him to Earth to find Odin. Dr Strange catches wind of it and helps them find Odin to get them the hell off of Earth. But along the way, they find Hela and she fucks their shit up and casts him to the cosmos so she can take over Asgard.&&For real, she's the Asgardian Goddess of Death just like in the comics, so it doesn't necessarily mean she's taking Lady Death's place in Infinity War.&&Hela is a God of Death.  But she IS NOT Death. Death, is the books as personified, is a woman who is intrigued by various characters, courted by a few, and...repected by all. 

Even The Living Tribunal and Eternity and Galactus know not to fuck with Death. Hela, however, is merely a supplicant to Death. She is not Death itself. &&He's the master of the lightning and thunder... for everyone!&&I want to see the really bad ass hulk. See what he is really capable of. &&The ""tell me, what are you the god of again?"" combined with the shot of Thor channeling the lightning through his body gave me chills.

Edit: To those saying it will be Loki, Hiddleston has confirmed he won't be in Infinity War

Edit 2: aaaand apparently Hiddleston lied&&Thanos has just started kissing Hela in the comics. &&the director specifically said he was basically throwing all the stuff from thor 1 and 2 in the garbage and actively pretending they didn't exist in order to make the best movie possible. 

edit: source from /r/movies ama: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/57oecm/im_taika_waititi_director_of_hunt_for_the/d8tnhgz/?context=3&&I'm glad they chose Waititi for Thor because the worlds of Asgard and other realms really need the visuals and this man is creative. You can really see his influence on the colors used. The entrance to Asgard is fucking rainbow road so it's sad to see that it took 3 movies to get the look right but right now I cannot wait until November.&&First two are solid but nothing mind-blowing. Thor 1 was a fun, fish out of water type of movie and had some good world-building but nothing that stood out. Thor 2 I just re-watched recently and again....some good ideas and world-building to let us understand how big the universe of Marvel stuff really is and had decent performances from everyone but neither are near the top of my favorite Marvel movies. But this? Combining Thor and Hulk and making it feel like an 80's buddy movie that's so damn colorful (and again....building up the world these characters exist in) makes me so excited. Can't wait for this. The director is top-notch as well, so that has me pumped.&&Doctor Strange did have a creative ending compared to other Marvel movies though. &&Hey don't shit talk Scooby-Doo I love those movies.&&Hey, to be fair, Scooby-Doo 1 & 2 are great movies.&&I'd argue it started with Drive. Especially considering Stranger Thing's soundtrack is HEAVILY influenced by Cliff Martinez.&&*It Follows* before *Stranger Things*.&&They do, because Deadpool can't die so Death lusts after *him* in a similar way that Thanos wants Death. Human nature and the ""forbidden apple"" kind of storytelling, since she can't have him that makes her want him. There's some fun Joe Kelly issues that show them together and Death is a frisky minx.   

I have copies of the issues, I'll see if I can get some screen grabs of the pages.

Aight, uploading to imgur right now. There's a Kelly issue from 1998 that's about Deadpool and Death having the swiggity swooty for each other, didn't screencap all the pages just a dozen or so relevant ones. 

Here we go, don't know why they never load in order. Always have to rearrange them.

http://imgur.com/a/OJrkl

Again, it's only some of the more relevant pages. So it's probably easy to get lost from a narrative point of view. But it at least shows that Death and 'Pool wanna boink. &&There's a recent comic called Deadpool vs Thanos which is pretty much a buddy team up when people stop dying and Deadpool and Thanos find out that it's probably involves their mutual ex.&&If she's the MCU version of Death from the comics, then you do go to her upon death. You can still kill her, but she'll just come back unless you kill Infinity.&&So Banner might took that SHIELD jet across the galaxy? Nice.&&On Earth he's the world's leading Nuclear Physicist with the ability to dismantle large cities like a Lego set. In the world of Gods he's Jim Halpert.&&Agreed. But I think for the  movies they're going to be blended into Cate Blanchettes role.  And I like it.  &&Calling themselves the greatest of the nine realms is probably what invites such challenges in the first place&&Jeff Goldblum is the definition of silver fox. &&In fairness, Karl Urban's character's hair is a *perfect* reproduction of [the character's hair in the comic.](http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/uploads/RayDyas/2009-04-15_195805_Skurge_the_Executioner.jpg)&&Look, Hela doesn't have time for hair.

Could very easily be separate, but it's mostly me wanting to see Cate Blanchett rock the antlers for another couple movies.&&I wonder if they'll actually use Death or go with Hela since they're establishing her in this movie and it would be easier for more casual comic book fans like me to digest. Rather than bringing out actual Death, which to me just makes me think of the Grim Reaper.&&Even deadpool respects death. Loves her in fact. But because of that he has a backup immortality system, not only does he have wolverine's healing factor but he is also cursed with immortality so that he may never embrace death. Thanos was he one that cursed him because he too loves death. &&How about One Above All? Is he stronger?
&&So, not to be That Guy^TM, but that isn't a painting of the Ride of the Valkyries. It's actually a Norse image of the [Wild Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Hunt). The name of the painting is Asgårdsreien and it was created in 1872 by Peter Nicolai Arbo. If the Wild Hunt was in Thor: Ragnarok they'd definitely be on Hela's side. It's a gathering of spirits or elves or fairies, led by a Hunter or Huntress, and is usually considered an omen of death.

I really liked how the entire arc began as a result of his distracted driving, nothing magical or mystical about it, just human error.

The real-world based movies were important to set a tone and ground some characters, but now we can really take off into comicbook madness.

I think Guardians did comicbook movies a huge fucking favor.&&""Hulk like tiny grey man, maybe not smash""&&On animated TV, all the time.

On film, ***never***.&&That whole scene was such a good intro to hulk. The unknown horror aspect was something that I wish they had played with a bit more &&Marks full of spoilers lately lol.&&He flew away in one of the Avengers jets. Not sure why he's been hulked our since then, I think they'll explain it&&Well, we knew that ""he is always angry"". Maybe in space he found no need to restrain himself as there are no innocents to harm.&&In the Planet Hulk comic run (which this flick draws from a bunch) Hulk has merged with Banner and is totally articulate. And also a fucking gladiator. So badass. If you can, read that story.  &&So that person is correct that happened in the 90s but it's not really analogous to what we see here. Merged Hulk is [handsome as fuck](http://imgur.com/3iJ7UVV) and speaks like straightup Bruce Banner.

The truth is that mute Hulk is by and large an invention of TV and film. Hulk usually has some verbal ability but it varies from broken English for dummies to Chicago mobster [(like, for real)](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/145849/2794961-mr_fixit.jpg) to full PhD level discourse. &&""We’re talking … disobedience. Stealing. Spitting. Running away. Throwing rocks. Kicking stuff. Defacing stuff. Burning stuff. Loitering. And graffiti-ing. And that’s just the stuff we know about.""&&bad igg&&Boy is a bit darker and more grounded, but a great movie. Sprinkle in some flight of the Conchords as well and you are ready to rock!&&I want another short featuring Darryl. They should bring back Marvel One-Shots.&&Fenris ulven who's Lokis child.

It was a pretty big holy shit moment to realize it was Magic Sword. Good for them, they definitely deserve more exposure beyond the outrun crowd.&&I was floored to hear that song.

""Of course you can.""

""Well I couldn't before!""&&Just a slight correction...

""I hate every ape I see, from chimpan-a to chimpanzee. No you'll never make a monkey out of me.""&&I always figured that Loki would play Mephisto's part.  Him being at Thanos' side for the majority of the film and then betraying him at a key moment would be pretty fitting for his character, and how Marvel keeps setting him up as ""sort of friendly, but still an enemy"".&&Thought he was Pip the troll? &&Depends what you're into. Hela has more meat on her bones in that she literally has meat on her bones&&Wasn't that supposed to be a pretty big plot point/cliffhanger though? I'm pretty sure the end was hinting that Loki had faked his death and killed Odin to take over his place and face.&&Yeah, I must've missed something, or misheard what was said,  because in Dr Strange [Thor said that he and Loki were looking for their father, right? I thought Loki had tricked Thor and taken the throne of Asgard by imitating Oden.](#spoiler). 

Since Loki is in this trailer I can assume he was taken as a prisoner by the same ones who took Thor; but Dr Strange is before Ragnarok? Judging by Thors hair.&&you could take it either way. I'm down with either honestly and it looks fantastically fun.&&It was the healing factor first, thanos curse comes later.&&That is from a future part of the series to add a little bit of fun between Pool and Thanos, and to jack up his healing factor to insane proportions. He's been quasi-immortal before the Thanos incident.

Same as Logan, his healing factor ~~is now~~ was insane (*oh ya, forgot, he ded*). He used to able to be hurt with deep enough cuts long time ago, now in the Civil War issues the dude literally grows his entirety back from just his eyeball after everything else was vaporized.    &&I don't recall this part of Fermi's paradox...&&Huh, that sounds like an excellent writing prompt&&Clooney is the traditional silver fox, Goldblum is the sleeper hit. Slattery is more of a white fox. &&He's a newcomer on the silver fox scene but he's earning his place. &&I don't think it counts if you've had that color hair since you were in the womb  &&This thread has potential. &&so that's it huh, we some kinda god of thunder&&Why is Thor fighting He Who Must Not Be Named?&&I enjoyed that whole storyline. The art was perfect and the story was epic without feeling over the top&&Don't quote me on this, but I believe that the word ""Thunder"" is much older than the word ""Lightning,"" and was originally used to refer to both at once.

I did a little research, and I've found that Thunder is directly descended from the Proto-Germanic word Thunraz (which actually was likely the basis for the name Thor).  I'm having trouble finding a solid etymology for ""Lightning,"" the earliest reference I can see of the actual word is from Middle English, around 1350-1400.  From what I can gather it seems to have just evolved from the word ""Light,"" (or ""Lighten"") and therefore wouldn't have been used to refer to actual lightning before 1350.  But take that with a grain of salt, I'm not really a linguist.&&Thor: God of Thunder by Jason Aaron.  I couldn't tell you the specific issue off the top of my head, though. &&I'm theGoddessof Deeeeeaaaattthhh&&Edward Norton has a reputation to be difficult to work with, and he wanted to have input on the direction of the character and movie. Marvel didn't want this, so they parted ways with him.&&He's a great actor but he would have went overboard with the Hulk. &&I think the craziest part is that Marvel went out of their way to say that it wasn't an issue of money.

I can see why Marvel, and especially Joss Whedon, wouldn't want someone else trying to take over creative control.&&Reportedly, he had to be dragged out of the editing room.&&Heimdell also needs a comedy sitcom TV series that revolves mainly around him with some of the people in Asgard.

* Starts with him watching people around the realms. Then ventures off to whatever quest the episodes involves before going back to point 1.

* Sometimes Thor drops by and they go break things. 

* Other times he has to stop and then scold Loki.

* There's always episodes where Odin will be depicted as the [dumb patriarch.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad)

* There's always jokes about Heimdell [sneaking peaks at other people's gfs](https://youtu.be/cmhEg-nDGJA?t=5) and shit because he sees everything.

* Every episode will have Heimdell reject at least 1 person from passing.

* Maybe even the guardians do a cameo.

&&all things serve the beam. #thereareotherworldsthanthese&&That poster's awesome wtf, why wasnt that what we got?&&Did some difging on this poster. Artist is named Martin Ansin if anyone is curious&&Damn that's cool. They really ought to go back to hand drawing some movie posters IMO like they used to with stuff like indiana jones and starwars.

They make these CGI cut and stick collages and they all basically look the same and have all these weird scaling issues and shit where they've fucked up the persepctives of characters trying to cram stuff in.&&That's because Mondo was involved.&&That explains it&&-looks at Black Panther's poster-&&No wonder&&It wouldn't surprise me if that very scene is the after credits scene for Ragnarok. &&Makes sense. I've been thinking the Guardians giving Thor and Hulk a ride back to Earth would make a perfect post-credits scene. Yeah, sure, Thor usually usually does his intergalactic travels by Bifrost, but I think Heimdal is gonna die in this one, plus the space stuff has a really ""Guardians"" sort of vibe, if that makes sense to anyone besides me.&&> and most big DC fights occur at night or at best on an overcast day. 

One of the things I really loved about The Dark Knight Rises was that the final battle took place in broad daylight. Not only is that uncharacteristic for Batman in general (I am the night, etc.), it made a really neat tie-in to the trilogy. The climax of Batman Begins was at dusk, the Dark Knight was in the middle of the night, and Dark Knight Rises was daytime, as the night is always darkest before the dawn.&&Gotta catch the Avengers up to the Cosmos some how.&&. . .

*smashes tiny grey man*&&Yeah in that movie he seems like a force of pure uncontrollable rage. That library scene is fucking good&&Maybe the perceived betrayal from Black Widow (throwing him in that hole so he becomes Hulk instead of running away with him as Banner) was a traumatic event and kept him in Hulk mode? I dunno&&I'm pretty sure that this is a Planet Hulk, Ragnarok story merger.  I hope the only reason it is not called that is due to marketing a third Thor movie was seen as better than another standalone Hulk movie.&&[deleted]&&Isn't the second image Joe Fixit? Used to be Hulk but they made him his own character.&&""No Asgardian left behind.""&&""We're talking going berzerk. Throwing tanks. Punching out airplanes. Breaking Harlem. Smashing. And that's just the stuff we know about.""&&A few times. 

Oh and Loki once road him into battle.&&There's been a few different versions of the Midgar Serpent in Marvel. I believe there is a literal snake that was in the Ragnarok storyline. 

But then a few years ago, Marvel did Fear Itself, which was another loose Ragnarok adaptation, where Thor fought 'The Serpent', who took the form of a man.&&Glenn was considered for Starlord so him as Adam Warlock could be a thing.  Holy shit I hope that happens.&&I'm shocked they even got her for Thor, I'd be even more shocked if they didn't plan on using her in the Infinity Wars. Getting Cate is like getting Leo, you've gotta milk that for all it's worth. &&Eva Green would be perfect. &&I really hope they eventually do the thanos imperative&&I did not know where the idea for the witcher wild hunt comes from. TIL&&In Canada it was dubbed as:

""I wish every ape was dead, from chimpan-A to chimpan-Z.""&&That is correct, it doesn't just hint at it, it's pretty explicit. I don't know if he killed Odin, but Loki definitely took his place. This is especially fun if you watch Agents of Shield, when Asgardians show up, under direct orders of who they think is Odin. 

I hope they don't forget about this. It was a pretty major plot twist that could cause major ramification in the MCU. &&I don't believe for a second that Loki would ever kill Odin. Probably the reason why Odin is on earth.&&The curse was almost entirely a product of the time for what it's worth. It's almost never mentioned again by either Deadpool or Thanos, to the point of basically being non-canon.&&Is Logan actually still dead?

The ""Hulk Smash"" scene still gives me goosebumps.&&It's a sneaking-around-the-rights thing. Universal retains Hulk solo film rights, but Hulk can appear in other films. Since this is a Thor film, no matter how big his part is, it still doesn't count as a Hulk movie.&&That was not a joke. 

He straight up bitched Loki &&Wait? They made non-Hulk Mr. Fixit stories? &&Thanks, it's 7 a.m. and I haven't slept, so at first I thought you meant Loki rode Thor into battle.&&I think I've only read about comicbook Thor when he was in the Secret Wars (I belive) so it's not exactly last year; I specifically remember when he got a symbiote like Venom.  
I was a bit confused by Thor dying, Thor having a clone, Thor resurrected?  
Is the Ragnarok storyline like the real Ragnarök? As in, Thor kills the serpent but dies, from the serpents poison, within nine footsteps of walking away.  
I assume it won't be exactly *that* specific but I heard that Thor is now female (I think I heard that of Iron Man as well but that was probably not true)&&He's a 5 star warlock. &&On the panel, her kids really, really wanted her to take the role, which was the thing that convinced her to do it. &&Comics be comics, the multiverse collapsed on itself merging all realities. So now they use Old Man Logan from a different 'verse. That and 616 universe X23 also has donned the colors and has become ""Wolverine"" in Marvel's endeavour to destroy their legacy characters and replace them but keeping their mantle because fuck making new interesting characters. Just hijack Thor and make Jane Foster Thor, kill Logan and make Laura Wolverine, rewrite Steve Rogers' history to make him a Nazi and Sam becomes Captain America. Tony Stark isn't Iron Man, it's now Riri Williams because fuck Tony Stark. 

Then they cry that their comic sales suck. Go figure. 

But back on point. 616 universe Logan lost his healing factor and became entombed in a block of Adamantium. If he's eventually going to be revived? Probably. But at the moment he's still cocooned.&&The most precious of all hair colors. &&Not. Yet.&&A live action version of Thor, Young Thor, and Old Thor fighting as a team. YES PLEASE!!!&&"".....Gorr was right""&&Rag nor rock across the land&&Plus, at this point, their cinematic universe is basically a TV series. They've got so many hours put into the franchise across all movies, and enough installments to easily make up two season if you just consider each movie as an episode. &&That and they do a great job and are cheap.&&Yes. As a Swede I now have to go and bleach my eyes after that tsunami of miss spelling of my dear language &&Ok, I laughed my ass of at this, despite how Iron Man was in like, 5 minutes of that movie.&&hahaha **Yes.**&&Ohhh noo, why does that look like a plausible game case...&&The Abomination fight felt kinda tacked on for me, but the earlier Hulk outs were excellent.&&How long do they retain the rights? I thought whoever had the rights would have let it lapse after the last Hulk flop; unless it made enough money.&&That's not as bad as Silver Surfer and Galactus, they can't appear in a solo movie *at all*. They can only be featured characters in a Fantastic Four movie as long as Fox retains the rights.&&please for the love of gods someone with a bit of artistic talent sketch loki getting a piggypack ride from thor into battle&&A young black girl, Riri Williams, and Doctor Doom are Iron Man. Tony is a AI or something or other.

I think Jane Foster is Thor. But so is someone else using the ultimate mjolnir. 

And let's not even talk about Cap.

Have you heard of a little flick called Fan4stic?&&They'll hold the rights and either reboot It years down the line or sell it off when someone wants it bad enough.

"First promo picture for Deadpool 2, featuring Domino",43616,6qp9p4,http://i.imgur.com/wMeMbrA.jpg,4539,1501516098.0,,"*Domino is a mutant with the ability to subconsciously and psionically initiate random telekinetic acts that affect probability in her favor by making improbable (but not impossible) things occur within her line of sight, thus causing her to have ""good luck"" and her opponents to have ""bad luck.""*


That should make for plenty of great scenes in this film.&&It took me way too long to notice deadpool&&She looks more like [Misty Knight](https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/b0/537bb5ee79404.jpg) than Domino.&&Not the biggest fan of the outfit though I like how this promo is a reference to the first dead pool promo&&I'm ready to see how they pull off Cable. &&Third prize in the [Paul Stanley](https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/images/big/Paul_Stanley_studio4.jpg) cosplay competition.&&It's like they looked at Domino's design in the comics and said ""Nah"".

With Deadpool's costume being so comic accurate, I was hoping they'd do the same for Domino, who was always one of my favorite characters. Instead they gave her a [Barf from Spaceballs eye](http://i.imgur.com/BcR5A0a.png).&&If FOX would just spend some money and get some makeup, [she could look like this](http://imgur.com/igfHFUH). I mean how expensive can black lipstick and ghoul colored skin makeup be? They used it on that Farscape girl all the time.&&I thought Domino's name was because she... Looked like a domino. I at least imagine that's what the writers were going for right?

Hell if people hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have even noticed the white spot on her eye.&&I'm thinking the main point of ""outrage"" here is that her skin is light enough that a black spot would have worked. 

They could have also given her the Gamora treatment. &&Wonder why they didn't bother with the [bleached skin.](http://i.imgur.com/oKEHo01.jpg) Especially considering how accurate Deadpool is to his comic counterpart.&&That doesn't look like Domino at all.&&If there isn't a Barf (from SpaceBalls) joke in the movie, I might be disappointed.  If they designed Domino to justify that joke, I will be disappointed.&&Looks more like Foxxy Cleopatra than Domino. &&[Lmao](http://i.imgur.com/WDAtliC.png?1)&&She looks like barf from Spaceballs. They could have done a better job on her makeup imo. &&She's a beautiful woman but that's just not how Domino looks at all. Domino's look is so unique in the comics I was hoping they'd at least try :\ the actress is great I just want them to stick to the black leather suit, pale skin with the Domino eye spot. Or even just try something else with her hair? I love afro's on women but it just doesn't fit the character at all&&Now I'm terrified about how Cable will look. &&So... Where's Domino? And what is Misty Knight doing here?&&My only criticism is that taking the white paint away seems really lazy.  It seems like they don't want to put as much effort as Fox does with Mystique putting the blue pieces on for hours on Jennifer Lawrence.  Part of ambitious filmmaking is going 100%, not 70%.  Fine, make her look like another rip off of Foxxy Cleopatra, but for fuck sakes.  A poorly painted white circle on her eye is not going to do it.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Let's do a count of how many times you've been called racist in this thread.  So far I'm at three. 

Apparently the fact that *I'm* black only makes me doubly-racist.&&Well.. that's pretty disappointing.&&what the fuck, looks nothing like domino 😒😒&&I don't really remember domino looking like that.....&&Oh Ryan you prankster! Throwing that Afro on there! I'm not falling for it!&&Whack tbh. Should've went with the bleached skin and black eye. This just looks like weak cosplay &&[deleted]&&Not what I expected at all to be honest. &&Well that's disappointing.&&Is this the year of black afro chicks? 

Doesn't look like Domino at all. &&That ain't the Domino I know :( &&Meh.&&Disappointed Domino doesn't have skin like Lobo. &&[deleted]&&I always liked domino so I'll remain cautiously optimistic. But this doesn't thrill me &&Contrast, for fuck's sake. That's the defining feature of a domino. She has to be black-as-night with a white patch, or completely paper white with a black patch. Coffee-and-cream doesn't cut it. 

&&Ah, so those creative differences that made the director of the first Deadpool be fried for the sequel have shown their head. 

This has a high potential to be a trainwreck&&Man I really wanna know where all this people that are like ""hey I'm totally okay with them completely changing the look of a character I love"" were when people complained about deadpools look on X-men origins: wolverine, when galactus became a cloud instead of a huge being, when affleck was chosen for batman, hell even when they showed jason momoa people didn't like him because his costume wasn't orange/green/golden and so on and so forth.

So can we please stop making this a political issue? It's clearly not about her being black/woman or anyone thinking that SJWS are taking over the world and whatever, people that know the character are rightfully angry at the fact that it looks nothing like the character like, you know, all those other times people complained about a hero not being accurate when it involved white men in this same position, are we now not allowed to complain about the same things we would normally complain about just because it involves women/POC/whatever?

She could be a great domino for all I know, like Ryan reynolds was a great deadpool on X-men origins wolverine up until the writers fucked him up at the end, but that doesn't change the fact that she looks nothing like the domino we're used to.

In short I'm just trying to say that this isn't racist/sexist/WhateverYouWantTosayAsABadKindOfpersonGoesInHere, it's just people that love the character being angry the character looks nothing like the one they like **and there's nothing wrong with that** , it's not an attack against her at all (and if anyone is attacking her directly well that's frankly undefendable and wrong)
That's also not to say that those who liked the new look are in the wrong here, nobody is in the wrong we're both just stating our opinions on a costume given our attachment to it and nothing else, no subtext, no evil intent, nothing more.

Edit: Fixed some typos&&[Looks nothing like her?  Is this a joke?](http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Domino-in-Deadpool-2.jpg)&&Why couldn't they just make her skin bleach white?

[don't be](https://m.imgur.com/t/reaction/zC0k1Qp) it's for the lulz&&If you can't see that you're being played, I have no faith in your skepticism.  This marketing strategy has been going on for years already.

Step 1: Cast somebody that doesn't fit in a role visually (i.e. Fat balding dude as Marilyn Monroe biopic)

Step 2: Release teaser that showcases this and then watch as the outrage begins.  (""wtf, why a fat dude for Marilyn"", ""uhhhh, because maybe he auditioned and was the best for the role"", ""but the source character looks nothing like that"", etc.)

Step 3: Articles about the outrage come out, clearly siding with the studio.  Bonus if they get a comment from them saying ""we stand with our actor, who is an inspiration"".

Step 4: People start coming out en masse stating their support and vowing to watch the movie.  Youtube videos for and against the casting will continue for months until it releases.

All of this free marketing... for the price of a single picture.  It's more effective than any trailer.&&Zazie Beets is fantastic in Atlanta, can't wait to see what she does with this character.&&ITT: People angry that they changed Domino's look after keeping Deadpool's pretty accurate.&&Wow. If this is a glimpse into the rest of Deadpool 2, it's fucking disappointing. 

The curse of sequels*... &&Ugh, they fucked her up.&&Some would say she's the reverse.&&I guess now that Deadpool is mainstream they don't have to care about true fans and just do marvel blockbuster shit, looks like design from Netflix marvel series, minimal and nothing like comics&&good one.  but seriously, who's playing Domino?  I get it, it's like when people merge Star Wars cosplay with another franchise.  She merged Black Widow, Misty Knight, and Barf from Spaceballs.  Hilarious.  

but seriously.  can we get Domino now?&&Domino?  Where???  I see Deadpool and some chick, but no Domino?&&Not a huge fan of it. Probably will turn out fun in the movie still, but this isn't a good first interaction with it.&&Doesn't look anything like the comic character :(&&I can't believe they butchered such a cool looking character. &&Awful, just awful.

Skin color aside, they got everything wrong. Hair, costume, even the fucking mark on her face doesn't look like Domino's because it'd clash with the skin of the actress that had to be black for some reason, unlike the character she plays. Seriously, remove the Deadpool trophy from the picture and tell me anything would give you the idea this is supposed to be Domino.

Fuck you, Hollywood! You and your ""diversity by all means"" bullshit!&&Short of making Domino a man, I don't think they could have fucked this up any more than they did. What we are looking at is the opposite of a good casting job.&&Didn't even notice Deadpool.&&Well the character is a far cry from the original character aesthetically, which is a little disappointing considering how they basically hit the nail on the head with Deadpool.

However, Fox did essentially the same thing with the complete overhaul of Negasonic Teenage Warhead. So I'm going to assume that this drastic design change implies there was some kind of favorable trade for the MCU to be able to use an X-Men or Fantastic Four character in one of their upcoming movies.

For those who are unaware, although Fox has the rights to the characters, they dont have free reign to do whatever they want with them. 

Negasonic Teenage Warhead's powers in the comics were originally Telepathy, minor reality warping, and the ""super soldier"" package. (enhanced strength, speed, endurance, etc.).

Marvel and Fox worked out a deal so that Fox was able to alter her powers to suit the character they needed in the movie, and in exchange, Marvel was given the rights to use Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 since Ego is considered part of the Fantastic Four IP.

Domino's physical depicition in the comics has a bit of a range but she's typically seen with pale skin or white face paint, with a black or dark colored marking over her left eye. Short dark hair, with vaguely asian looking features. Powers-wise, Domino passively affects probability around her giving herself good luck and her enemies bad luck. She also instinctively reacts to attacks by putting herself in the ""luckiest"" position possible when she moves.

The hair looks dumb on a character who is supposed to be a bad ass merc - oh so she should have ""white girl hair"" your a racist!  Why didn't they give her the chalk white skin - because that is whitewashing and your a racist! She looks like Misty Knight - oh so all black woman look the same to you then your racist!

Fox has built in defense on this because no matter what you say your going to be called a racist because of it even if you say you like the actress just not the choices they have made with her.&&Everyone's complaining that they made the character black, but if you think about it, a domino is actually black with white spots - so this is technically accurate.

And it goes like this&&hahahaha

/thread&&Welp, I'm not unseeing that anytime soon.&&Dang it, I knew I recognized it.&&When I see the new Domino, I will now only now see Barf.&&It's really pretty disappointing. Deadpool was praised for being accurate to the depiction in the comic books. Colossus actually looked and acted like Colossus. This just doesn't look anything like Domino, and before anyone says what about Negasonic, she was a very minor character so changing her was fine. Domino has been a pretty big part of X-Force and other X-men titles. I really hope it's not too late for them to do something about it.

EDIT: Wow. I just woke up to find out that apparently I am a white supremacist despite being brown and south east asian. Look, all I want is for Domino to look like she does in the comic books. That's it. Not everything in the world has to be a part of your SJW crusade. **It really doesn't matter what ethnicity the actress is because even with a caucasian actress they will still need to use make up and body paint to make her as unnaturally white as Domino.** Her name is freakin Domino for fucks sake, she needs to look like it. &&Holy shit just imagine if John Candy was still around.

Just an off the wall casting to switch it up and play with gender reversals. &&Ok, glad I wasn't the only one who made the Space Balls connection.&&Her lips aren't even white!&&And people who want comic book accuracy are being called racist, because she is black. 

We grew up with the comics, just because new people don't know who they are, and don't care about the changes, doesn't mean tons of fans don't. &&I'm gonna be honest here, the original design was pretty generic, and this design matches up with that fairly well. Instead of a pale girl with a black spot over her eye in some generic black catsuit, we have a dark girl with a white spot over her eye and an equally generic costume.

It's not like this is some iconic design from a well known and loved character. She has a cool ability, and that's about as far as it goes. && This is[ Domino,](http://imgur.com/a/Ia1zG) that is not.

&&I figured Domino because of how her powers work, causing a 'domino effect' that ultimately works in her favour.&&[I guess this was the intended effect.](http://imgur.com/a/gz0ZV)&&Writers? More like Leifeld regurgitating one of his tropes.

Somebody on the costume design team had to have suggested this, this color flip-flop, probably *because* of her darker skin.  What's next?  We get a black man to play Bruce Wayne, but he has to wear a white Batman costume to...  Oh, [wait](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/23/21/29E742D800000578-3136564-image-a-31_1435089738599.jpg).&&I don't think anyone is really outraged.  They had a choice of mixing things up and going with the reverse that Domino usually is - black skin, white dot - or just keeping the normal white skin, black dot, and they chose a middle ground that just doesn't look that good.  The actress is a very light skinned black woman with a white dot on her eye.  There's not enough contrast, even before getting into the argument about what the character's original design is, what the design for the movie should be, etc.

I think casting a person of a different race than the comics is fine.  But they should have just committed to it and gotten an actress with darker skin, or painted Zazie's skin darker.  Hollywood, in spite of what they like to say, is still very against using anyone, especially actresses, that are actually black instead of some variation of half-white, half asian, etc.&&I feel like if they wanted the inverted colors it would've looked way better if they went actually the opposite of comic domino and had her skin pure black, as in pitch black and white hair. 



Then she wouldn't look like some minimum effort cosplayer.&&I've never read the comic, but imo Domino looks much better in it. The costume here looks like something out of Austin Powers.&&The actress is black. Somehow I doubt bleached skin would go over well.&&Tbh people would probably get offended over bleaching a black actress' skin white, so they wouldn't want to risk the controversy. &&Yeah... they kinda pulled a ""Deadpool from X-Men Origins Wolverine"" on us...&&She looks like a WHOLE LOTTA WOMAN! &&“r/movies!

Some people are really into it, but personally without the white skin I don't see enough contrast. Her entire appearance would be on the darker side, and I think the purpose of the original eye dot was to give more contrast. In my opinion, black and white stands out more than black on brown. 

I actually like the vitiligo makeup a lot, because it adds a sort of realism. From what I know, most superheroes and such don't wear makeup, instead it's usually a significant part of the character's backstory. If the Deadpool Domino was a real person, I don't think she would actively be putting weird makeup on their face. I think it would make more sense if it was a birthmark, a disease, or a part of her backstory. This is probably sounding really ignorant, especially because I don't know a thing about Domino, but that's my current view on the matter.&&Right? She is more punk/rock than anything from what I've seen in the comics. A black girl can play that just as fine as a white girl. Maybe a Mohawk/fro would have been better? Like someone else said, this looks more Austin Powers than anything. &&Totally true. It's so stupid to cast someone who doesn't look like their character AT ALL. Can you imagine Black Panther or Luke Cage played by a fat eastern european, asian or spanish guy?

Fuck it. I respect all genders and all races and all nationalities equal. I'm a human and a citizen of Planet Earth. Dear moviemakers, could you not play inverted US racism please?

I don't understand it. 

I look at your examples, and I don't think they fit. With X-Men Origins, people were way more upset about Wade's character than his looks. Galactus was the least of FF's problems, and nobody complained about Ben Affleck's appearance. They just complained about his acting.

Jokes aside, while some of what you said is true, ultimately studios want films to succeed and make money (despite Hollywood accounting).

They're already releasing character shots of her in costume.  This is the same point as when the public was introduced to Leto's ""Damaged"" Joker.  There is no turning back now.  :(&&I have to nitpick here--it's accurate in how it depicts Deadpool and Colossus, but they completely changed Copycat. 

This Domino doesn't look *that* different with the exception of being Black with a white eye vs. White with a black eye. The makeup looks a little weird, but it's not *that* big of a change. Also, Zazie Beetz is a good enough performer I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. TBH, though, I think they should have stuck with black on Black skin rather than having the contrast--it would look better, I think. &&People like to lash out at stuff like that. It it looks like now most of us agree with you. I liked the original design so much more because it made her more unique and a little unsettling to others what with the stark white exterior and what not.

This just doesn't look anything like Domino, and before anyone says what about Negasonic, she was a very minor character so changing her was fine. Domino has been a pretty big part of X-Force and other X-men titles.

So at what point is a character not minor enough that it's okay to change them? Because the average person does not know who Domino is. Even people that like superheros don't know who Domino is.

I'd say X-23 isn't a minor character and that character in Logan is nothing like how she usually is. &&http://imgur.com/9jANdbY.gif&&I feel that way most of the time, but there are several exceptions. I feel as if the original incarnation of the character has defining physical features that are a staple to the character, they shouldn't change his/her ethnicity. For example, having Nick Fury go from a generic-looking white guy with an eyepatch to looking like Samuel Jackson with an eyepatch (first in the Ultimate universe, and then in the actual films) was a change I liked. Nick Fury didn't lose anything when they made him black (and they also kept him white in the original universe anyway). Laurence Fishburne in Man of Steel as Perry White is another example. 

A bad example is when they made Jimmy Olsen black in the Supergirl series. Jimmy is known for his trademark red hair and freckles, and for being a huge dork of a character, the latter being much more unforgivable. They instead miscast him and wrote him to be extremely bland and boring. The same is true for the opposite whitewashing of non-white characters (most notably The Last Airbender)&&The black spot on the white skin made her look like... You know... A domino.&&The problem for me is Ryan Reynolds must have thought that joke first... Will he use it or is it just too cheap?&&Easy.

Here's how this works: You cast a character, and you don't discriminate on skin colour, and pick someone on acting ability.

That guy that never offends anyone. But in all seriousness I think that this'll still be good enough that as soon as it comes out we'll forget about this pretty quickly. &&That but also because of her design.

Exactly.

>  gotten an actress with darker skin, or painted Zazie's skin darker.

I maintain a black dot would have worked with Zazie.&&I think it would have been a bad decision to go full opposite and paint her darker black as people would say she's in black face and people might say whitewashing for the normal coloration of Domino. I understand that that's what her skin color is in the comics, I'm just trying to look at it from a movie exec's view.

I think the only exception would be if they explained her backstory (like with Deadpool) and showed how her skin got that way, if there's a reason for it at all (haven't read X-force). But that would mean it would become to focused on Domino than Deadpool.&&I can already imagine the blackface controversy.&&They really couldn't do that. They should've just gone with a very very white color with a black eye spot. &&I actually would like her to be really black, like ""turn on black and white photo settings and nothing changes"" black. Have a white spot on her eye with stark contrasting white lipstick? Also not a fan of Domino having long hair, curly or straight. I think you nailed it when you say ""minimum effort cosplay""&&Yeah like from goldmember.&&People know that caucasians aren't literally white, right? Gamora is green but the actress is black.&&[It's been done before.](http://i.imgur.com/GAx4QM2.jpg)&&It's not a race thing. Domino has unnaturally white skin, just like how Mystique and Nightcrawler are blue.&&Why is that, though? Sure, Sofia Boutella put on white makeup for Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond and I'm sure other actors have. Why should her skin colour mean we lack a comic accurate Domino?&&It'd still be a black actress though? The character is originally a weird pale blue anyways. Gamora is green but played by a black actress. Seems lazy from an art direction sense to not do something like that for Domino.

Edit: *I legit don't give a toss either way though. As long as the character is strong and acting is decent enough. Reinventing looks happens so often in comics it's nice to see changes.&&That's definitely not true. Her mouth isnt sewn shut. &&Big money got involved so the suits got involved.

The hair is very distracting.  I really hope they make some changes cause at this point the character is a stark difference from the source material.&&I was okay with her until you just ruined it for me.

I hope you're happy.&&That would have been actually fucking amazing, not gonna lie.&&Agree.  With a character like Domino, it doesn't really matter what the actress looks like - there should be makeup and costuming that covers it up anyway.  I understand that this is ""realistic"" superheroes, but I mean... Nightcrawler is still blue.  They couldn't just handwave her being white (or, given the actress they chose, even black / #000) because of 'reasons'?&&if it was the same actress with white makeup and straight hair i'd be super down. who cares if the actress is black? it's the character that needs to be preserved.&&Infinite pockets&&Other abilities: Enhanced reflexes and agility, Master markswoman, Expert martial artist.

Shd just looks like a regular girl with vitiligo on her eye. Nothing about her tells me she's domino. She could just be a random girl in a cat suit and the bad make up makes it look like she just has vitiligo.&&I kept going ""who the fuck is Copycat?"" while reading this thread. I had no idea Morena Baccarin's character was supposed to be an established mutant. Is she even a mutant in the movie? &&she's really light skinned, black on black would have looked great. oh well&&I like Zazie, but this look just seems lazy to me. I get that sitting in the makeup chair for hours on end really sucks, but I just don't understand this one. Are they just freaked out because they don't want to be accused of racism or something? I don't care who was cast as long as they can act, but good lord this just looks plain lazy.&&>I think they should have stuck with black on Black skin rather than having the contrast

I agree. She is Domino - she should resemble a domino. White circle on tan skin doesn't immediately convey that.&&Zazie is lightskinned enough that she could still have the black circle around her eye, honestly. The white circle looks pretty bad. I also think they could tone down the hair a little. It's completely bananas. Outfit looks good though.&&> This Domino doesn't look that different with the exception of being Black with a white eye vs. White with a black eye

Brown with a white eye.

 Why would they call her ""Domino"" when she looks nothing like a Domino? Like how does her name actually make any sense at all now?&&Jimmy Olsen, or James as he prefers.... in supergirl makes no sense. He is the polar opposite of the OG.  &&Are the black dominoes with white dots not just as common?

I'm 100% on board with a vantablack domino with a large round white spot covering her left eye, but this isn't it.&&The black dot probably would look great.  I just mean, if they're going to go with a direction - ""reverse"" domino, black actress, white spot - then they should have committed more than they did.

That being said, with who they cast, yes.  Black spot, black lipstick.  Gives a lot of great contrast, drives home that the spot isn't just a weird bit of makeup.&&> people might say whitewashing for the normal coloration of Domino

You can almost hear the outrage if they had taken the Gamora approach. &&Would that really happen since the actress is black?&&Controversy if the actress wears all white makeup with a black spot, controversy if the actress wears all black makeup with a white spot. I guess black actors/actresses just can't wear makeup anymore without causing some kind of controversy.&&Not to mention Domino isn't *white* per se, her skin tone is different from all normal Caucasians in most depictions. It's usually a [grey / blue color](https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/e/e6/Domino01.jpg) or [super pale white.](https://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/n_iv/600/864311.jpg)&&But there's no green privelege.

I have a feeling that being a badass black chick is going to be part of her character, and it will also give Deadpool plenty of opportunities to make off-color (pun intended) comments.

I mean what are the odds Deadpool doesn't say something like, ""I thought you'd be whiter?""

Edit: By the way: If you look closely, you'll notice she has a white patch painted over her left eye, making this a sort of ""reverse"" domino.

I'm going to have to go back and read the end of New Mutants to X-Force. Just for the grins of it all. &&As much as I would like to shit on Liefeld as an artist/writer, for me he still will have a legacy as a founder of Image Comics, which made possible for a new generation of independent artists and writers to do some of the best graphic novels produced in the last 2 decades.&&There are at least two surviving Madrox dupes. 

One is raising a family somewhere, and the other changed his name to ""Matt Rocks"" and became a talent agent in Hollywood. I am not kidding.&&yeah he's dead.  they killed him in the mid 90s with a sad ""i've got a disease"" bit.  but then they realized that was stupid, and he had a dupe out in the world who hadn't died with the rest of them... and it turned out HE was jamie prime.  so then they did again with the inhumans' disease.  ...they should really just do it again.  he's a real solid bloke.  have him join the real team.  it was such a shame that x-factor just became a holding pen for the B-list&&Really?

For *shame*.&&They actually did make an episode, super low budget and aired it once in the middle of the night, but only so they wouldn't lose their option. 
This property is pretty well fucked. &&Vitiligo is an interesting take on it though. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the intent, to make it a little less like this chick just does her eyeliner with a jumbo crayola each morning.

The color of the actor/ actress skin dosent really matter if they are going to paint them anyways That probably would have been kind of cool.&&And Copycat is supposed to be unnaturally white (EDIT: and blue), too. And Wolverine is supposed to be short. Like a foot shorter than Hugh Jackman is. And Scarlet Witch is supposed to be a natural mutant. And Vision isn't supposed to be J.A.R.V.I.S. Some of the changes they make for movies are annoying, I agree, but others just don't turn out to be that big of a deal, IMO. 

 I get where you're coming from, but I think as long as they nail the attitude of Domino it doesn't matter if she has clown-white skin. Her skin tone is part of the her mutation in the comic, yes, but lots of different film adaptations have changed the fundamental looks of characters--I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. &&They don't say one way or the other, but my hope is that they introduce her powers in the second film. &&http://i.imgur.com/U337m8l.jpg

I've got to agree, it just doesn't pop visually.  Should have just kept the black color of her eyepatch, since she is fairly light-skinned anyway.  &&>  she could still have the black circle around her eye

Exactly. She would look amazing with some Furiosa-black eye makeup. The off-white patch isn't menacing or striking enough. The outfit is, indeed, pretty great. &&Yeah Supergirl TV is just a mess. It has a couple nice episodes but sandwiched in between awful storytelling and obvious pandering, and I am not just talking about the shitty 1st few episodes (they eased up on the whole man-hating thing) .

People like to be mad.&&Tell that to all the Muppets.  They all know how Kermit is oppressing them&&Thing is though, you shouldn't have to look closely to see anything different about Domino.

Was kind of on the fence about this movie but this teaser has me all in and is all I'm going to watch of it until opening night.&&Soooooo. What's this about ?&&It looks like Spy Kids 3D with a budget.

Edit: After reading the plot, isn't this exactly the plot of Spy Kids 3d?&&The amount of Easter Eggs in this Jesus, just waiting on the 15 minute analysis videos. &&this movie was in production for some time, so happy its finally here.&&The scene at 0:39 looks like it might be the [dance party from the book](#spoiler).&&I don't understand anything from this trailer? What exactly is the plot? All I see is fanboys jizzing to nostalgia.&&Where did this race, depicted in the trailer, occur? I dont remember it in the book&&I am blind and watch movies with audio description. I read _Ready Player One_ through the Library of Congress' Braille and Audio Description  service and I loved it.

Big car chase/race was worrying though, there's nothing like that in the book. Nice to see a DeLorean, but it looks like some of the big nerdy references (80s games+movies, D&D) are getting replaced with generic over-the-top CGI action&&And the Delorean?? Also, pretty sure I saw Freddy Krueger!

Odds that it'll be good is probably a bit better than a coin toss if you ask me.&&MA5B assualt rifle from Halo made an appearance too.&&Just think Willy Wonka meets the Matrix meets 80s pop culture&&Its a good popcorn read. Its not high fiction and the plot is just enough there to get things moving along, but its meant as basically a video game in book form, with a shit ton of pop culture references since the creator was a huge pop culture nerd and littered the Oasis with things from his childhood. Since the key to his easter eggs is pop culture, everyone ends up consuming it to a high degree to try to get into his mind and figure out where the easter eggs are since getting them means you gain control of Oasis the company and thus become a multibillionaire in a world thats in its worst depression since the great depression. It's so important that on top of individuals hunting them down you have whole companies (the guys with the IOI tags on them) seeking it out too. &&Yes until partway through.

Feel like it can't be bad&&VR world (the Oasis) that gets consumed with people looking for clues to an ""Easter Egg"" left by the creator of the world when he died. Whoever finds it gets control of the guy's company (billions of dollars) and control of the Oasis itself.

There's also a corporation trying to find the egg and privatize the Oasis, which was all of the IOI guys getting in cars.&&Don't you talk smack about Spy Kids 3D.

thats the plot. We've gone full circle. &&[deleted]&&Who needs a plot when you have REFERENCES!!!!!!!Gotta prove how cool you are by knowing all of them. &&[deleted]&&You're dogging a movie with pop culture references by using a now pop culture reference?&&I found the book hard work. It felt like if you removed the pop culture references you'd be left without a story, except for the words 'and', 'a' and 'the'. &&It's Scary Terry, bitch!&&It's already happened. It was trouble indeed.

WARNING: Potential spoilers for an 80's movie. (In a 90's timeline, thanks  /u/Chicken2nite.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJnuP2_yb8&&The book is basically an '80s nostalgia trip. The writing itself isn't anything fantastic and the cultural references are really what ""makes"" the book. The plot is an interesting concept (the virtual oasis will be bequeathed to the whoever finds the easter egg inside the game first). However, without the '80s nostalgia, I personally don't think this book would have done as well. I felt bombarded by all the references (Admittedly, I was born in the early '90s so many of them went over my head). I'd describe my overall reaction to the book as, ""meh."" I'd hazard to say that what made it popular wasn't the writing/story so much as the reminders of bygone days.

All that said, as I read it, I couldn't help but think that the ""digital"" setting would translate into a movie really well. I'd go watch it with friends but am not dying to see it.&&No alarm clock on the dash?

This movie is completely ruined now. RUINED, I tell you!&&His Screen name in the book.&&Fingers crossed for a cameo appearance from Pacific Rim jaegers/kaiju.&&Technically he wasn't, he didn't have time to form before getting blasted.&&If only because everyone is attractive in the movie.&&Definitely a good thing. The book has tons of scenes that would be super visually boring in a movie, or otherwise just like, nonsense. &&Finished the book a week ago as well and in this case I'm totally fine with them changing things here and there! &&Nah that doesn't happen in a city, I'm betting it's just a scene from a game he randomly plays or watches?&&If it isn't 95% references then it's not following the book hahah.&&Because he does end up in Ohio, and it doesn't really add much to the story to have to film him changing locations. Saves time for more important scenes. &&The producers/writers may had made the change to highlight the wealth disparity in the same city instead of showing the same disparity across states. &&everything changed after the great Giant Eagle Kroger wars&&Can confirm, live in Columbus and we have barcades. &&You need to use a backslash to escape (ignore) the last parenthesis in that link for it to work.

""You got it.""&&And WB also got a bunch of properties together in the Lego movies.&&The movie is essentially the Matrix meets Willy Wonka meets dystopian pop culture novel. It takes place inside a massive MMO called the Oasis that is basically a second life to everyone. Literally everyone is playing the MMO, because the MMO has everything. Every single fictional world ever created is part of it. The owner of the game dies at the beginning and hides essentially ""the golden ticket"" from Willy Wonka inside the game. Whoever finds it inherits the game. And pretty much all the money and power there is. The developers of the MMO are also MASSIVE 80s nerds, which is why the future of 2050 has a very 80s feel to it, because they basically influenced the world through the game. One of the very first trials the protagonist has to face is the nerdiest 80s shit ever, which I won't spoil unless asked for. It's a very fun and light read!&&If you like the 80's, video games and pop culture and treasure hunts then yes it's a good story. &&Yes. It gets hate online but it's a really fun book.

Takes place in a dystopian future. Everyone does everything through a virtual reality game called Oasis where you can be and do literally anything.  The creator of Oasis dies but leaves everything to anyone who can find 3 keys hidden in the game. A poor kid from the slums tries to figure it out. It's fun.&&Imagine you could enter a virtual world populated by all of the pop culture cartoons, video games, movies, toys of the late 70s and 80s. An open sandbox where you could play in a vintage 80s arcade, or play a live action D&D campaign. 

There is a scavenger hunt that requires people to know their obscure 80s pop culture trivia. The internet is openly accessible, but it won't help. Winner gets to run the virtual world. But one of the competitors is a huge conglomerate company that wants to monetize everything with microtransactions and ads. &&I'm willing to bet that is Aech. &&[I mean who'd thought a 2018 movie would have a mech pilot jumping out just as it's destroyed only to turn into fucking Ultraman to battle MechaGodzilla!!!](#spoiler)

... and a sappy scene with Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time of all things.
&&The music in the trailer too, although it's not as obvious.&&I always thought he would make a good halliday :/&&fuck
i forgot about that&&With the GIGANTIC resurgence in D&D, the first key seems safe to be in its home. I can't see them not having it.&&I mean, this is just a trailer. For all we know, this race scene is an insignificant part of the movie, and it was cherry-picked to entice people who have never read or heard of the book (like me). 

It's best to think from the perspective of the marketing team: ""We've already hooked the die-hards who were going to see it anyway. What can we now do to make this movie seem interesting to the widest possible audience.""

I got chills watching this trailer, and I have no idea what the movie's about. It's definitely worked in my case!

We could get any Superman in this movie.&&If they meet, would Superman mistake him for Metallo on steroids?&&Oh my god that would be incredible.&&Ok, so that *was* Pure Imagination. 

It sounded like it, but parts of it didn't line up so I didn't know if I was imagining it or not.&&Very fitting considering there's a critic blurb on the cover of the novel calling it ""The Matrix meets Willy Wonka."" &&This movie is going to be like Christmas for the fans of easter eggs.&&Also, at 1:01 you get a better look at it when that character uses it to shoot someone.&&The person using it, that's probably Aech right? Because he is shown a couple of times in the trailer.   &&That's snake eyes! That sword placement is spot on&&I don't think that's Snake Eyes, but I do think the guy walking behind Iron Giant is Snake Eyes. 

Edit : Apparently, the guy behind Iron Giant is a Ninja Turtle. &&Am Oklahoman, can confirm we are disappointed on a near constant basis.&&Yeah, it wouldn't take long and besides, it'd give reason for why IOI is HQ'd in Columbus and how shitty his OKC location was.&&At least they have Paul George for a year now&&They had a large part of Logan, except it was all shot in New Orleans.&&Boy, Disney and Warner Bros are gonna pour down their IPs in different movies and it's gonna lead towards a heck of a showdown.&&Not exactly correct.  Oasis is a virtual world where people occupy most of their lives - school, work, pleasure etc...  

There is an actual economy to the world which makes it expensive to do luxurious things, but for the most part, it is better than the real world.  The founder of this world and the Oasis dies, but right after he dies, the entire world is played a video that tells them that he has hid three special keys somewhere around the virtual universe, thousands of thousand of worlds.  He has left hints in his video and his lengthy notebooks which are available to everyone.

Whoever finds these keys becomes in control of the virtual universe as well as the oasis company, essentially becoming worth hundreds of trillions of dollars as well as the most important/powerful person in the real world/virtual world.

It turns out the creator of the system is in love with pop culture (all movies, songs, video games, TV shows and such from the 70s-early 00s) and much of the clues that lead to the keys are based on figuring out pop culture puzzles.  If you actually are able to find a key, in order to obtain a key, you have to pass extremely challenging tests based on elements from pop culture that only someone with as extensive knowledge of pop culture as the creator would feasibly be able to pass.&&Well there were plenty of locales & references from all decades; I don't think this'll be in the movie, but the main character ends up owning his own version of the Serenity from Firefly.

I suspect the transition between chubby and fit everytime he enters/leaves is completely unnecessary for the movie.&&Lol you're getting downvoted but you are exactly right.

I can see why.  I would feel awkward peddling my previous work.  

edit:  Because people keep on thinking that Spielberg references are crucial to the story (they're not).  Here is a list of all of the references.  And one of the things it points out is that there would be no Delorean because Spielberg was a producer for Back to the Future.  Which we can see the Delorean in the trailer.  So Spielberg was mostly likely directly referring to things he directed like ET, Jaws, etc.

This treasure hunt causes everyone to study the life of the now dead developer.  And as he's a huge fan of pop culture from his early life, there is now a resurgence of 80s culture as everyone consumes it in hopes of figuring out these riddles. 

It's like national treasure.  Except remove the historical references and replaces them with pop culture.  And it's not a secret hunt, everyone in the world knows about it.  &&He's the most entertaining movie YouTube personality &&He'll still name the video ""8 things you might've missed"".&&Yup, nostalgia masturbation.&&That book is basically an author masturbating onto a pile of 80's arcade games, TV shows, and other 80's references while simultaniously vomiting forth his own personal fantasy of how he would become a gazillionaire because he's the *best* at 80's pop references while also telling us how he would woo his awkward, shy, slightly flawed but beautiful and badass childhood crush.  

Basically a sort of quasi-sister story to Sword Art Online.  A story that starts so strongly about basically living inside of a virtual reality game, with an interesting and engaging premise, which then slowly unravels into a kind of creepy weaboo level of bullshit.  &&""There was an obstacle to overcome, and he did it.

Maybe that helps you with your decision! &&Oh yeah they also could have changed the key locations... didn't even think about it. The only place that really happens is on zork? It was key on ludus and gate in that hometown in the 60s, key on Zorn and gate at any pyramid, then key on the rush planet and gate at the castle.&&looks like how they illustrate the sixers out numbering people&&Maybe they just didn’t want to bomb OKC again. &&The movie has been billed heavily as truly being an adaptation, not a direct translation to film.

See, nobody cares.&&Let's not hope Spielberg gets cheap on us, that was Lucas' mistake.&&I kind of don't want to see that just because I know how Bill Watterson feels about licensing his creation.

Edit: [Exhibit A](http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/syndicate4.jpg)&&Ahh yes the old Lego Poophole Loophole&&It's being played at the beginning to. Just not the same exact version. Changed but still enough of it there to hear it.&&Yeah the main theme throughout the trailer is a warped version of that song! Really tactful scoring.&&I started singing that song and didn't know why. &&It's not just at the end, it's literally from the moment he puts on the visor in the beginning.&&Exactly yes.&&The book's love affair with the 80's felt entirely too forced.  It seemed way too fake at times.  The people in the book literally dedicated their entire being to playing 80's era arcade games and looking for clues for a gazillionaire's fortune.  That's some anime level shit.  

Plus the relationships between the main characters just came across as so awkward, and again, forced.  

I thought the book started great, but by the end the 80's references and the awkward, pre-teen level puppy love romance between two internet strangers kind of killed it for me.  &&I'm with you. I expected to love the book because all my friends pushed it on me for the pop culture. Like...yeah I got the references, but the story was poorly written with nothing to really connect you to the characters. I couldn't finish it. Very weak. &&Yeah.. it was hard for me to get through. It's not the worst as YA fiction goes but young adults aren't going to relate to any of the references,  so I'm surprised at how popular it is. 

It's so much wish-fulfillment and ""wouldn't this be cool,"" but it's not very well written wish-fulfillment.&&To me it felt like eating a whole cheesecake. At first you're like ""Mmmm, delicious 80s pop culture references"" and by the time you've made it half way you're like ""ohhh god my stomach hurts I can never look at an 80s pop culture reference again"".

I expected it to wind up a satire about pointless pop culture references, because it's 2045 and the world is shit because nobody has done anything new because they're still obsessed with stupid 80s nostalgia. But the shoe never actually drops, it seems to be an unironic celebration of that stuff.&&I know it's blatant nerd pandering, but I'm an easy lay for that sort of thing. I enjoyed it.&&Yeah. The in your face references bothered a lot of people.&&[Here it is](http://imgur.com/Ehe3MKK)&&So it's Aech in the monster truck; and Art3mis on the light-cycle and Parzival in the pimped-out DeLorean?

But from the get-go, when Spielberg was announced as director, my thought was, ""Ah-ha, gotcha now you cagey fucker. You essentially presented my youth on screen, now let's see how you deal with the incredible impact you've had on my generation."" He had to know going in to it that all our eyes would be wide fucking open to how he would handle the self-referential aspects of the film. The wait is almost over!&&Yes, yes it was.&&That was the moment they had my ticket money.&&That too.&&[deleted]&&And G1 Optimus.&&And that Ultraman in there too&&And don't appear in the trailer credits as ""Cinematic game changer"". .&&There really isn't many Spielberg references in the movie.   Especially if you only include things he directed.  Like he produced back to the future, and we have the DeLorean. 

Here is a list of references.  It's not much that will be missed.  Also none (as far as I can remember) which is crucial to the plot.  And most of this would've been blown away anyway while crunching a book down into a movie.

If he was actually influenced by these people, then maybe his book would actually be good instead of a massive pile of masturbatory wish-fulfillment dogshit&&I bought the audiobook and decided I'd listen to it on a trip to Chicago, and I regretted it so, so much. IIRC, that last paragraph was part of an entire chapter that was literally just paragraphs and paragraphs of... that. Like the author made a list of every pop culture factoid he knew and just copy pasted it into the book with almost no editing.

There are people defending this as a stylistic choice, but it still seemed to me the most lazy, boring possible route the author could take. There are ways to assert character traits without throwing a truckload of mind numbing text at the reader. Not to mention the dialogue is stilted and cringey even for a mediocre YA novel.&&How did this get turned into a movie?&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Wasn't there several pages of two characters arguing over Ladyhawke being good or not?...&&More like ""Luckily my brain contains an encyclopedic knowledge of the entirety of media and culture produced in the 80s, somehow in more detail than the combined memories of the hundreds of people working together in the guilds or at that sizer company.""

She told me the story is really good, but I can't get over how it sounds exactly like this with a wink, a nudge and a ""*ya get it? HUH?!

The linked clip is even better because most of the fights last a bit longer, but Godzilla just shits on Zilla (the official Toho name for the Emmerich lame knockoff). &&Yeah, it was one of the outstanding moments.&&Can I get a spoiler?

Charlize Theron Says Script For 'Mad Max' Prequel 'Furiosa' Ready To Go,40820,6mo2mw,http://theplaylist.net/charlize-theron-says-script-mad-max-prequel-furiosa-ready-go-20170711/,2418,1499796911.0,,"I don't know if i want a prequel but a sequel would be nice.&&I'm actually kinda bummed about this. I feel like every part of Furiosa's story was told exceptionally in the subtleties of Fury Road. I'd much rather move forward than backwards.&&She's one of those characters who's better without a backstory. Please don't do it.&&It's Furi-O-sa, not Furio-SA!&&People are making a *lot* more out of this story than they need to be. It's a click bait piece spun from a quote from Variety, where Theron talks about she's ready to play the character again if the film actually happens.  That's it.  There's been zero forward momentum on the project itself.&&Furisosa I think is left best to work as legend, and let stories tell her tale. John Wick is an example of how that works well. George Miller is a great writer though so sure he won't disappoint&&I think all of us just want another Mad Max story with the usual goings on of him being a mysterious stranger thrust into a bad situation and finding a way out of it then riding off into the sunset.&&Prequel? I'm the biggest Mad Max fan there is, the Road Warrior is my favorite movie of all time. I do not feel good about this. Would prefer another tale from the myth and legend that is Mad Max, not a Furiosa backstory. &&Not really into this, unfortunately. &&[deleted]&&As much as I loved Furiosa. I think the best part about Mad Max is he is a secondary character in other people's stories, and we got to see Furiosas. I want to see his next crazy adventure. And tbh I thought Hardy was a fantastic Max. 

I want more of Max Rockatansky &&I don't want this I want Tom Hardy. &&We're in the business of taking a good thing and running it into the ground. Why leave anything to your imagination if we can potentially make a fortune needlessly explaining it away. &&Hopefully another Mad Max sequel will be in the near future but this will be a nice appetizer.&&🎵 *Mister F* 🎵&&Not interested in this at all. Hope they just do another Mad Max or if they do do a furiosa focused movie (again) it's set after fury road and not before. &&Wasn't Fury Road already almost entirely about Furiosa? I actually disliked how much it shied away from Max as a character.&&Wow, people seem to have no trust in George Miller.  I was blown away with Fury Road.  If George wants a Furiosa prequel, I want it.&&[deleted]&&Hell yes. Hope it's as well crafted and shot like last one &&Bring back the Thunder Dome.&&This is a very misleading title. The script for this film has always been 'ready to go'. Miller wrote 3 films during the pre-production phase for Fury Road.

He has not said anything about what his next move will be. &&I thought she wasn't going to do another MM movie?

Regardless, Fury Road was the first movie I'd seen in *decades* that reminded me how good movies could be. This news is going to carry me to the gates of Valhalla, shiny and chrome. &&Mad Max made me adore Charlize, she is a bad ass all the way around!&&Lame lame lame

&&Why can't we have another mad max movie about, you know, mad max?&&Don't get me wrong, I LOVED Furiosa in MMFR. I just think her arc is complete and wished the franchise would just move on with sequels with a different cast (excluding Max obviously) and make them separate stories. 

But hey, I'll def watch this. Love me some Charlize Theron&&I really don't think this is a story that needs to be told. Part of her being an awesome character is they kind of kept the fact she was in fact the lead a sort of secret, it was subtle and the story was awesome sort of like Max's story in the first movie. I'd much rather have a 2nd movie in that universe as a sequel rather than a Prequel. 

I have no doubt the movie will be *good* but I do doubt it will live up to the ""reboot' movie. I am just hoping this does not kill the prospect of actual sequels off. The Mad Max universe is pretty deep and unexplored.&&I want more Max...&&Boring&&What the fuck is the point without Max - THE titular character, watch them keep Mad Max in the title even then, because they know without it won't attract as much attention.&&I hope they don't show how she lost her arm. I hate when movies do the ""I lost and arm a day ago, and I'm now a pro at using this prosthetic.""&&I know I will enjoy this movie but it will be like hot tub time machine.

Anytime there is an action sequence everyone is going to be looking for the arm being chopped off.&&At this point isn't it mad furiosa?&&Mad max was one of my favorite movies if not my favorite!&&Sigh.  Prequels always turn out to be shit.  &&Fuck yeah, bring it on.&&FUCK YES&&Well when I heard they were making another Mad Max, my first reaction was to roll my eyes and put that movie with all the other stupid reboots and sequels. I didnt watch it in theaters and waited until it was on Netflix, but I thoroughly enjoyed the new take. Paid just enough homage to the first one, while telling its on story, a good story at that. So I will give this prequel a chance. &&mel gibson is mad max&&Maybe a prequel would clear up those mad max flashbacks that had nothing to do with any previous movie &&We needed this as much as a fat kid needs a cheeseburger. &&Mad Max movies have always been sort of episodic and self contained. Continuity-wise they're actually pretty inconsistent and Miller has acknowledged this so it kinda bothers me that they're sort of trying to establish a timeline. Max is a legend of the waste land and it the fact that the stories are inconsistent like that adds to that idea. It's kinda like Zelda, you can sort of piece the games/movies together but that's not the point. Furiosa was a good character but they should just move on. &&Generally I hate prequels but I don't usually watch Mad Max movies for the intricate storyline.&&Twist: the movie focuses entirely on Max and Furiosa is a supporting character whose name isn't even mentioned until the very end of the movie.&&Shouldn't the next movie be Max stumbling on a different group with their own story? What more is there to really learn about Furiosa that would be able to fill a movie?&&Great coz they lost the script for the first one. That's why there's no story.&&If this gets greenlit and put into production, I'm gonna pass. Every Mad Max movie, save for the first, has been about the journeys of Max and the people he meets. He's always been the one who'd bear witness to the story of others and would help along the way. That's how the formula works for this franchise.

Furiousa's story is told, leave her be. I get people loved Charlize Theron, but Tom Hardy was pretty cool too, and I want to see more of him. I want to see Max meet new characters in the wasteland.&&She was badass and all but I watched that movie because of mad max. I left wanting more mad max. &&But I don't want a prequel....I want a sequel....this bums me out. Too bad, probably not going to see this. &&What a shame. Completely unnecessary film. &&SCRIPT LEAKED:

Go straight.

Fight scene.

Turn around and go back.&&Yeah.. I don't need this.  I would like a thunder dome update though.  &&I will take anything I can get before Miller kicks the bucket.&&Furiosa is just a generic character. She shouts commands and is the strong leader out of the bunch of women but she's not particularly interesting. When people say she's great, the fact that she's a woman probably weighs into their opinion.&&After Fury Road, I have enough faith in the people behind this franchise to give this a chance.&&Great, a Mad Max Cinematic Universe. Because so many people were asking for that.&&What a stupid name Furiosa is.&&I love the Mad Max movies, but please don't do this.&&Mad Furiosa, not Mad Max.&&Does she mean the ""Furiosa"" sequel to the movie ""Furiosa""? Because she was the main character in that movie. Max was just a prominent co-star.&&What could possibly happen after Fury Road, though? Her story ended. The rest of it would be her as the new leader, taking over for Immortan Joe. It'd only work if she wasn't the main character, just the jumping off point. &&Prequels are a pathway to abilities many consider to be.. unnatural. &&Agreed, the entirety of her character came through perfectly already. Her home was attacked, she was taken, proved herself, became a soldier, proved herself, became an imperator, found out about the sex slaves, and then the movie happened. All of those emotional points were expressed in the character.&&I could see it working if she's not the protagonist. Instead, she should play Max's part, a jaded observer, getting swept up in something larger than herself, perhaps helping to track down an escaped wife, or something like that, which would provide a meaning for ""redemption.""

This would allow the traditional Mad Max themes (individual survival vs. group), while preventing the standard prequel problem, which is knowing the hero will survive.&&Right. I feel like this would just ruin what made it great. Sometimes it's better to just leave things to the imagination, Mad Max has always been good at doing that.&&“Oooh people loved the character of Furiosa, especially her mysterious nature! Let’s explain every bit of it to people even though they never asked for it!”&&https://youtu.be/d1qxTSCPBoM

>Look, it'll be a hard day. But I guarantee you that a hundred and sixty days' ride that way... there's nothing but salt. [points back] At least that way, we might be able to... together... come across some kind of redemption.&&I am critical of the whole notion of prequels just because of the reason you mentionws; it is always better to move forward than try to explain something that often does not need more Indepth explaining.&&As long as George Miller is producing and directing this I'm 100% on board. More Imortan Joe, more of the many mothers and how it all develops.  
Could be fantastic. &&> I'd much rather move forward than backwards.

That's funny because the second half of Fury Road is about going backwards.

I'll see myself out.&&Yeah the details and lack of them explaining anything is why I fell in love with the movie. However I know people that really didn't enjoy it because of the lack of explanations. Nothing in the movie really makes sense if you don't make some educated guesses. 

I think the movie is probably being made for two reasons. First is that anyone who enjoyed Fury Road will come back for more. Secondly, it will very likely increase sales for the first film from people either wanting to give it another shot or see it again with all this backstory. &&I was so amped for this, then I read your comment, got confused, re-read the headline, realized I missed the word ""prequel"" and now I'm bummed too.

I want to see Furiosa as Queen of the Wasteland, fighting to unite a kingdom and bring hope back to a dying world.  I do **not** want to see the fucking story of how she lost her arm, because who the fuck cares.

Fuck prequels!  They're so unnecessary!&&I'm stoked. We know all the big parts of her story, but the big thing that we don't know is how she became Imperator. It could be badass.

Though to be honest, I'm also stoked about this just because I know it'll do amazingly in the Box Office and it'll just further prove wrong all those people who were claiming the reason the new Ghostbusters movie failed was sexism.&&I personally feel like Mad Max shouldn't move forward or backward.  Ive always seen Mad Max movies as just legends being told as there doesnt seem to be much continuity between the films besides Max.  &&That moment when she met the women and they did the hand thing to honor her mother, and she sees them do it and kinda learns that hand gesture in the moment, it brought a tear to my eye.  There was so much feeling in that one shot.

Its not so much thag i dont like going backwards, i just prefer some stones left unturned so you can image whats underneath &&Exactly. It was already her movie and it was fantastic.&&> the subtleties of Fury Road.

There's a phrase you don't hear very often.&&The best part about Fury Road is that they skimped on plot so they could show more awesomely-choreographed, beautiful action scenes. To say a prequel would necessarily be bad for plot-related reasons seems to miss the point of Fury Road. They'll have a skeleton of a plot, and flesh it out with more awesome action.&&That's how a lot of people feel about Han Solo. Some characters just don't need to be expanded on. &&Ok I won't. But just for you.&&So many people in this thread have much too little faith in George Miller.&&I dunno if you heard, but the script is ""ready to go"" &&Just like Han Solo.&&Stop it Ron, stop!&&Stahp it Max staaaaahp&&/r/unexpectedhogwarts &&Okay, yeah.  You win.  Thread's over, everybody!  Pack it up and go home.&&Well... I want there to be even less momentum&&So, in other words:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f3/d7/fe/f3d7fe4b7934ce9677ef949cc2dc76d3.gif&&Thank you! I've been scrolling down for years waiting for someone to point this out.. i was excited to read the article thinking ""oh great the script is finished and shooting might start soon"" but no just rehash of old news from two years ago!&&My only worry is that after the success of the first one the studios will try to be a lot more involved in building the franchise, which has kind of lead to the deaths of properties in the past.&&Sammy Sosa&&John Wick is getting a comic book and likely a TV show prequel with his creators.&&Yeah, why mess with a good thing? &&Especially with it being Hardy as Max. He does such a good max it felt bad ass just watching him speak barely any words&&If they were going to do something where it's related to the other movies but not starring Max, I think they shouldn't do the story arcs of characters before they met Max, but do the stories of the lives after the people who were affected by max and how it changed them. But I'm not really sure how interesting a movie that'd be.

I guess if I were going to do it, I'd have one of the kids from Road Warrior, maybe 5 years later when they're a teen try and track down Max. Probably because he's a legend to them and their community is in trouble again. The kid remembers how Max helped save them before and thinks he can recruit Max to help them again. In tracking him, he'd go through the remains of Thunder Dome and the aircraft kids, through Fury Road, and any other adventures you wanted to have had Max go on.

I think in meeting the other people, and seeing how they've also lionized Max but also learning some real truths in it he might come to see Max was never a hero there to save people, he was a capable man who was trying to survive and some people just benefited from that. In tracking Max's path he of course would come to meet new villains that filled the power vacuum that Max left behind him, and thus develop into a fighter himself.

I think the fitting, if not acceptable by today's standard, is that he would never find Max. Instead that Max wasn't endowed with super powers as people like to talk about him, but that he himself could do anything that Max could do. He would head back to his village knowing that he had the power to fulfill the role that Max fulfilled years ago. But when he gets back he finds the village to already be under heavy attack, he joins the fray, but finds the forces he thought (the reason he was originally sent out to find max) he'd be fighting were just an advanced party setting things up, he's fighting a much larger force now. The small group should fight well and with ingenuity. But he should lose his family in the fight, and should be wounded badly by main antagonist in the final show down. He can best and kill the antagonist, but he's lost everything of meaning to him.

Actually you know let's make the protagonist a teenage girl. She's sent out in the dead of night on a motorcycle to rush past the patrolling enemies in a harrowing run. We're past the point where guns are common so she's equipped with machete like swords. She's out here partly because she looks up to max and partly because it's what the town wants. But one of the elders, one who actually fought with max, pulls her aside and gives her a small sack of valuables saying ""he might not be as noble as people remember... if he doesn't accept this you may have to offer yourself as well"". Her job in the community would have been a forward scout so she's good for this role. In her path she refines the machete sword fighting technique and gains faith in her abilities and resourcefulness, but also sees how when you try to help people they might not help you when you need it or even be that much better off themselves. She'll return in time to see the larger force destroying her home and killing the people she loved. But the lessons of the her journey means she knows enough that rushing in would only be her own death and would change nothing.

She makes a plan to ambush the antagonist leader, which goes mostly successfully. They battle in a 1 on 1 duel at the end, the antagonist almost bests her, and in doing so he damages her eye. But in taking the time to gloat the protagonist uses a dirty trick to free herself and kill him.

The end of the movie can be her cutting a piece of fabric from the antagonists clothes to use as a makeshift eye patch. She sheaths her machete swords and gets on her motorcycle. The voice over of her riding off into the sunset leaving the burning remains of her home behind would be as follows ""Once again max, with out meaning to or even knowing, saved my life and changed me forever. Now I wander the wastes with out a home or a cause. I finally understand the man I once thought of as a hero, and I know that he was just a victim.""

Now we're set up for a series of road warrior movies starring a badass one eye'd machete wielding biker girl. And I'd watch those.&&100% agree. Honestly the only thing that a furiosa pre-quel is doing is trying to ride the wave of media/popular feminism by trying to make a big action movie with a female lead. Her character, as many other people have stayed more eloquently than myself, doesn't need that. It's been fully developed. Adding a backstory to it just weakens that character and honestly hurts the series/franchise overall.  &&I'm worried about this and the Han Solo movie.  Han Solo's past was supposed to be shady and mysterious.&&Basically Rey in Star Wars 7. This obsessive need to show strong women protagonists is getting ridiculous. If a character doesn't have any flaws it's a boring watch.&&Tom Hardy makes me Hardy.&&Yeah I like how the Mad Max tales are just one guy roaming the wasteland, encountering different tribes.  I'd def be down for Max and Furiosa to team up again though.&&Yeah, same.  There's a million other people in this thread that I'm echoing here, but it's true.  I don't want a Furiosa movie.  The reason she was cool is because they told you just enough about her and you get to imagine the rest.  I just want to see Max meet new people in need and maybe learn more things about himself.&&*(grunts)*  &&Isn't Mad Max: The Wasteland coming?&& Mentally Retarded Female&&To be fair that's not unusual for the mad Max series. Other than the first movie the movies usually revolve around other characters and Max is basically just passing through&&In the Road Warrior, Max himself only has 16 lines of dialogue, 2 of which are repeats of the same line. 

It seems like the usual M.O. for the series (discounting the first) is Max wanders into a situation, helps fix it, then leaves. &&I loved how Max's character was handled.&&Same thing they did with Max in Road Warrior and Thunderdome. &&Basically yes. If the movie had been called ""Furiosa"" and the name of Max was ""John Jazzatanski"" the movie could be exactly the same and not have anything to do with the Mad Max franchise.

The movie was amazing, and Theron killed it, but it is time to move on.&&Other than the first movie, max has never been the main character.&&Yeah, that's my attitude about it, too.  It's not like some studio is ordering him to do a Furiosa movie instead of a Mad Max movie.  He was inspired to write the script when he wrote Fury Road.  If he ever actually makes this Furiosa prequel, I'm not sure why any Mad Max fan wouldn't want it.&&Yeah, all the other prequel examples that people are bringing up seem to be cash grabs; proposed, written and directed by **third parties**. (Prometheus/Ridley Scott may be an exception.) George Miller gave us the Doof Warrior -- I'm waiting to see what he'll surprise us with next.&&Reading through the comments, I'm reminded of a lot of the things people (including me) said about Fury Road before the footage started coming out. 

It was an old franchise.
The previous movie of which was the least popular.
There's new cast.
There's the original director who is now about 70.
20 years in development Hell. 

It seemed like a recipe for disappointment. I remember groaning obnoxiously when I heard they were finally going ahead with the long-rumoured 3rd Mad Max sequel.

This time, I'm reserving judgement.&&Agreed, if George Miller wanted to make a prequel about the two headed lizard from the beginning of Fury Road I'd be all for it if he could do as great a job as he did with Fury Road..&&MEDIOCRE&&>  because they know without it won't attract as much attention.

Bullshit. All they have to do is drop one bad-ass trailer and everyone will be sold.

&&So if a movie as good as Fury Road was made you wouldn't go just because Max wasn't in it? Heck, I'd go to a prequel about the two-headed lizard if it was made as well as Fury Road...&&I mean that's really what people where arguing against Fury Road; ""another useless sequel that will be crap.""&&Where can I preorder my ticket&&[deleted]&&no no no. the franchise isn't about building a new society and shouldn't follow Theron building the city. let me ask you a question, what separates the mad max films from say Resident Evil Extinction? the mad max films are not post apocalyptic films, yes on paper they are but at their cinematic core they are *westerns*. Max is the *Man with no name.* A drifter that goes from town to town and gets involved in a bigger plot that he somehow makes a positive contribution before moving on. Did Clint Eastwood ever stay in one town after the Good the Bad and the Ugly and run for major to help build the West? no. The next Max film should have almost nothing to do with Fury Road and be a new story with Max meeting new characters.&&While I don't think this will be the case, the film could see Furiosa needing to protect the Citadel, which is largely defenseless after they killed Joe, Rictus, their allies, most of the War Boys, as well as many of the allies from Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. The whole reason they were able to return to the Citadel at all was because there wouldn't be enough forces to put up a fight against them.

So, Furiosa is now presumably in charge of a very ideal location which is home to the most valuable resource in the world, but the army that used to live there and protect has been wiped out. Any tactician worth his salt would organize a siege on the Citadel as soon as possible.&&Easy, she's the villain protagonist. You think running the only functional farm in a thousand miles is easy? You think everyone was starving and thirsty because Joe and the boys just squandered it all? Hell no. No one stays alive in the wasteland without doing terrible things and that includes the leadership.

Start with the best of intentions. Then make some concessions to practicality. And before you know it Furiosa is the big bad and Max comes back and he's not at all happy about it.&&Well, for one thing, they're all gonna die pretty soon when word gets out that a bunch of ""nice people"" are in charge of one of the most valuable resources for hundreds of miles.&&Its mad max; just have society collapse again&&It's treason then&&Yeah, but who killed the world? &&I thought that she was taken to be a wife, but somehow lost an arm and become ""imperfect."" But the big guy was too attached to her, so he made her an imperator. Did you see something that stated she became a soldier voluntarily?&&MM:FR had more subtle backstory than it did explicit plot. Entire movies were implied in single lines, or grunts as it often was. One of the best movies I’ve ever laid my eyes on, the cars, action sequences, combined with that story. It was head and shoulders above any action flick I’d seen in ages. &&> preventing the standard prequel problem, which is knowing the hero will survive  

Good point. They should make her arm the hero. &&>while preventing the standard prequel problem, which is knowing the hero will survive.

But in most cases, we know the hero will survive, prequel, sequel or standalone film. That's not the problem with prequels in my opinion. &&what if in this prequel film, she's the antagonist?  &&Yeah i could totally see that. 

Basically, it could be a hunt for one of the wives from the first movie or a new batch of younger wives. Furiosa is an up and coming grunt who has already made it halfway up the corporate ladder despite being a female (albeit a rejected one due to her deformity). 

As the movie progresses- focusing mainly on the escaping potential wife/wives, Furiosa, who was 'indifferent' and 'just trying to survive' past the trauma of the lost of her mother and her situation - is reminded of the greenplace and the clan of mothers. She is also seeing the absolute evil that Immortan becomes when someone takes something of his.

Throughout the movie she does immortan's will. It could be close to Mad Max: Road Warrior - where a group of pacifists attempt to protect and save their tribe and Furiosa earns her Imperator promotion by being the best 'warboy' bringing Immortan his prize (for the sake of evilness, maybe she brings back children for him to raise into a wife).

Then a big moment should come, the child-wives probably have to die in a gruesome accident that immortan laments, but does not really 'care' about. Something similar to, one of the surviving tribesman or tribeswoman, probably a parent of the children - suicides the children to prevent them from a life of being immortan's baby factory. 

At this point, Furiosa flashes back and remembers her own mother's attempt to take both their lives and her final cry of desperation as she realizes she failed and Furiosa falls into Younger Immortan's arms. 

At the end, as Immortan honors his best warboys, and announces that furiosa is now his best imperator, Charlize Theron does her best to earn another Oscar by portraying a Furiosa who has to look honored, and also at the same time, hatching a plan to free the current wives. And this kind of sets up her whole 'redemption' thing

THE BULK OF THE MOVIE WILL BE FURIOSA FUCKING MURDERING ESCAPING TRIBESMEN AND SHIT AND I WILL BUY TWO TICKETS IF SHE SCREAMS ""WITNESS ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""&&She wont survive intact. I bet we will get to see her loose her arm.&&> Mad Max has always been good at doing that.

The last one was really good at it. I'm not really sure the original ones were. And I mean I love Road Warrior and even Thunder Dome, but I don't think they have a good of a story telling through omission that Fury Road has.&&If Miller's not directing then most definitely. &&I'm betting she gets her inner strength from micro organisms in her blood. &&Ah yes, the Ridley Scott approach.&&""I don't give a shit about where the stuff I love comes from, I just love the stuff I love!""&&Hey worked for Boba Fett!

*did not work for Boba Fett&&I NEED TO KNOW WHERE FURIOSA GOT HER BOOTS!
did she make them? did she buy them at a store? I need this plothole explained to me!&&That moment you realize they are talking about driving over the ocean floor...&&has anyone calculated where they would end up after riding for 160 days? i would assume they would at least reach what was South America and not die in the middle of the ocean floor. 

Edit: Nevermind. Figured it out. It's roughly 12,700 kilometers between Australia and the South American coast. Probably lesser since the distance was calculated from the center to center of each continent and Max's party was already on the Australian west coast. To make it to S. America in 160 days, you would have to cover roughly 80 kilometers each day, which motorcycles can cover that distance in an hour. So it would be 160 hours or less to make it to Argentina. It would take them a few weeks depending on how many hours they will ride in a day to get to Argentina. Still doesn't mean it will be sunshine and rainbows once they've reached S. America, but it wouldn't be just salt. &&> Frank Miller 

George?  Frank is the 300/Sin City guy.&&I'd rather George Miller do it. While I have enjoyed some of Frank Miller's comics and some of the films inspired or influenced by them, I hear The Spirit was absolutely terrible.&&> I think the movie is probably being made for two reasons. First is that anyone who enjoyed Fury Road will come back for more. Secondly, it will very likely increase sales for the first film from people either wanting to give it another shot or see it again with all this backstory.

That's it, boys!  He's cracked the secret of sequels!

Doesn't matter if it makes sense, this is a business with a proven bottom line.&&Yeah a team up would be ok. &&Exactly yes I feel her story was played out.

Hardy is signed on for sequels and Miller has said he plans on directing more but so far nothing has been formalized.
&&Mad Max and the Desert Rangers!&&Mad Max: Scherzer&&[deleted]&&What? All of the films before Fury Road have been about Max. They have all revolved around Max, we follow him, the film focuses on him as a person and his growth as a Character. In Fury Road, he lacks substance, character or even presence. His coolest moment happens entirely offscreen. He is an action stuntman at best. They put far more effort into Furiosa than they did Max, and it worked in getting those sales.

The best Mad Max film is the first one in my opinion. The action is meaningful, the characters are realistic and the descent of the world into apocalypse is clear.&&Yes. Anyone who complains Fury Road wasn't about Max has never seen a Mad Max film. It is never about Max and in the end he always ends up alone/left behind. 

Max is always just a character in someone else's story. In Road Warrior it's the feral kid's story. In Beyond Thunderdome it's Savannah's. Both are a retelling from the narrator's perspective, not Max's.&&I don't see how limited dialogue proves he wasn't the main focus of a film. An action based movie can easily focus on a protagonist without much talking. &&I would argue that Max as a character was a lot more explored in the previous movies than in Fury Road.&&But, if they follow the trend...then maybe Furiosa is this film's Mad Max? Perhaps she'll be the solemn observer who steps in to aid someone else who will end up being the star of the film?&&He has always been the main character, he is the character we care about and follow. I have to question if you have even seen 2 or 3.&&you're absolutely right. That's how I thought it would go. Fury road ends with max leaving and becoming a new man with purpose again. On to the next people that need his help&&You would like the Mad Max game. That game is fantastic, and it does exactly that: make a new set of locales and characters with Max, through his own actions of survival, being swept into a regional conflict. &&I agree with all this and it begs the question how can you have a prequel that logically doesn't involve max?&&Which would be a great movie, probably, but then how could the jump on the ""strong female"" wave going on right now?

Like, Mad Max was great and Furiosa is great but there's really zero reason to make this movie.&&To be fair, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly is the last movie in that trilogy. :P&&Seige? They're atop the only source of water and green for hundreds of miles. Guess who wins in that scenario?&&Why would Max care? Only in the first Mad Max, when there was still a semblance of society, did he get involved in other's problems. And it was kind of the end of Mad Max that made him the reluctant hero of the other movies.

He's not a bad man who hurts people needlessly. But he's not a hero who just helps people because it's the right thing to do. That's why he always walks away at the end of the movies. Because he was never in it to make society better, he just got dragged in to other people's fights, when the fight is over generally no one is holding him hostage any more so he just leaves.

If he came back and Furiosa was a evil dictator it would be against his character design to get involved just because.&&basically the plot to Thunderdome...&&That would actually be interesting they can't do that! &&Ehhhh, I'd rather like it if she was the morally ambiguous kind of villain where she's not a ""big baddie"" but the decisions she's made has harmed some people but she did it for the greater good. You can make enemies like that as well. But I would not like Mad Max to be in the picture.&&> Start with the best of intentions. Then make some concessions to practicality. And before you know it Furiosa is the big bad and Max comes back and he's not at all happy about it.

I dont think people would want to see the Hero become the bad guy.&&Great idea, make the feminist icon into the villain that the man has to stop. People will love that.  

Edit: I don't doubt it's a good idea, I like it. But the truth of the matter is, if you make a female hero that is nothing BUT virtuous and archetypal, people start nitpicking, campaigning and tweeting. Especially if you make her into a villain, even a complex one, and 'the man' has to intervene. &&I wouldn't call them nice. They were just smart enough to take control in the end, and had some sort of vitues. Theres no reason why they'd become a target; its more likely they gained respect.&&Trick question Mad Max and associated movies are  just documentaries about Australia&&It was a combination of fossil fuel extraction (Gastown), the military industrial complex (the Bullet Farmer), and religious fanaticism (Imortan Joe).

That's how I describe it to people.

(well i think i did, if i saw it with subtitles now, i will probably understand way more)&&At first, I thought MM:FR was a really shitty movie. 

This was because i saw it at a drive-in, and couldn't hear the movie that well on the radio outside of the car.  I was with my ex and her family. That's why we weren't in the car. 

I just recently watched it, literally the other day, and now I think its fantastic. I could actually hear Max talk. I could hear all the dialogue and understand the story better.  Before, I thought all Max did was make grunts the entire movie, besides a few quick remarks here and there. 

10/10 movie. Would recommend. &&Gets cut off. Used to hold down the gas pedal of a tanker trunk that crashes into the enemy just as she jumps to safety. &&The best sequels or prequels you don't even know its a prequel until it's over and you're like ""Dayum this is a prequel?""&&IMO, the biggest problems with prequels is you know that there won't be any character development. They almost HAVE to be a stagnant character, unless the movie is specifically about how they've changed to get to the point in the original story. &&I feel like the best way to handle prequels is to give the protagonists goals, and things they care about, which have nothing to do with how things turn out in the sequel.

This can fully free the film from the constraints of the original film.

Still hard as balls to pull off though.&&Do you know who I think would make an amazing antagonist in a movie?

John Wick.&&I just went back and deleted my original comment pooh-poohing the idea of a prequel. Just reading this made all my hairs stand up. That would be amazing.&&But it never really needed story telling. It felt more like the adventures of Mad Max, traveling/surviving the wasteland while occasionally getting thrown into some battles. &&Maybe not Thunder Dome, but Road Warrior does a much better job of exploring the character of Max and does so with minimal dialogue and mostly through the audience interpreting his action or inaction.&&Nanomachines?&&She's a strong independent wasteland warrior who don't need no Max. &&When I first saw Fury Road in theaters and that quote happened, I whispered to my friend ""Where in Australia can you drive 160 days and not hit the ocean?""

Is pig in the city a worthy sequel? &&AHHHHHHHH&&Mad Max 2: Judgement Day&&I'm gonna do that as soon as I go back in time and stop your birth&&followed by a script and a budget, thanks!&&Uh, I'm afraid to ask, but..I take it I missed a new rumor?&&Mad Max: New Vegas&&Nope. Max might be the character the film focuses on, but he is never the centerpiece of the story.&&I really love Beyond Thunderdome and its airplane kids. Only recently watched all 4 movies for the first time. I was thinking, if Max ever finds Sydney (not that he will likely) in the new cast, Jewel Staite from Firefly could play Savannah. But they'd probably wanna get someone unknown and from Australia, you know...&&**Thank you!** This complaint never fails to make me shake my head. A member of my family made it, and I was like, ""Dude, have you even *seen* Road Warrior or Thunderdome? You want a movie about Max, watch Mad Max. He only needs the one.&&Why retread old ground?&&No, he's right. I have to question if you followed the narrative of 2 and 3. Mad Max 1 is all about him, 2 and 3 are him getting swept up into someone else's struggle. Especially 2, which is about on par on that aspect with Fury Road&&I get what you're saying, though I think the point of all 4 movies is that Max is going to be dealing with his demons forever. Every baby step to being a socialized human being is immediately followed by him becoming a lonesome drifter again. That's how Fury Road ended: riding off into the wasteland alone.

&&Just like the Trigun anime series! Kind of...&&Reminds me of Bruce Banner and how at the end of every tv show he'd be walking down another dirt road on his way to a new town..&&I suppose you could say another.......settlement needs his help&&And a new interceptor please?&&That game was repetitive af&&Praise be!&&Just make a new character. Hell, you can even cast Charlize Theron again. It doesn't matter. George Miller did it at least twice in the Mad Max series so far.&&They could have Max and Furiosa take off to say, chase a McGuffin. Anything that gets those two on the road again together. &&They can still run out of bullets and gas...

Like the guy said, there will never be a better time to take the place, then when their army is basically gone. &&I see what your getting at but if they can breach and have enough bodies it doesn't matter.

In that case it makes even more sense.&&That all went out the window with Thunderdome. It was in his best interest to kill Blaster, but he doesn't because it would have been wrong - and it ends up causing him a bunch of trouble. (Bust a deal, face the wheel!) It is not in his best interest to go after the children that left and to pursue them to Bartertown, but he does. Again, because he does still have some bit of humanity left and he recognizes that it's the right thing to do.  

The intro voice over to Road Warrior even strongly suggests that him not being a total self-serving bastard anymore is the entire point of the series: "". . .men like Max, the warrior Max. In the roar of an engine, he lost everything and became a shell of a man, a burnt-out desolate man, a man haunted by the demons of his past, a man who wandered out into the wasteland. And it was here, in this blighted place, that he learned to live again.""&&You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain&&The idea here isn't so much that Furiosa is the bad guy as much as it is the Wasteland itself. You could easily do this plotline and have her working with the best of intentions with plenty of time to explain herself.&&I would love to see some movie or TV series do this (No, Star Wars doesn't count), but not this one. Fury Road was defined by Furiosa's struggle to achieve an abstract good (which was was then subverted by turning a bad into a good), and having her turn into an antagonist, however reluctant or unintentional, would make the whole struggle of the first movie feel hollow. I would rather see her quit from leading than make the hard choices that turn her to a villain.

Part of it is, I think, you have to really start the series planning the subversion of hero to villain. It has to make *sense* for them to turn, and heroes in pop media are rarely written to have that potential innately without some tragic betrayal or other dramstic character shift.&&I like the part where you pigeonhole women into a strictly virtuous archetype. The idea you replied to gives a woman protagonist growth and a range of qualities, which is just about the least sexist thing you can do for women in film.&&If that's what your worried about have her be right. I'm not joking about the everyone does terrible things aspect, even the women that used to live in the green place used people as bait and presumably attacked and killed those that stopped (I doubt they differentiated between those that stopped to rape and kidnap versus those who stopped to help).

Have the citadel being run as efficiently and fairly as possible, but life is still horrible for most people most of the time. Do the double twist and expose Max as a huge destabilizing factor.&&So Great Britain is is to blame?&&Mad Max is actually a historically accurate story of Australia in the 1970s.&&Fury road was shot in Namibia. There's a lot of cool stuff about that movie. I think I read the Director had his wife as an editor as she hadn't done any action movies before and he didn't want it to be like other action movies.&&At least Barter Town was run on bacon. &&The best symbolism is practical symbolism. Like you're right, all those three are symbols for our world, but they also serve practical, vital purposes in their fictional world. Gastown provides much needed gas, Bullet Farm the ammo to fight and defend themselves in the unforgiving desert, and Immortan's cult a mythical anchor around which society structures itself.&&I'll never understand all the people that hated the movie because ""They don't explain anything!""

buddy, they explained EVERYTHING&&The series explicitly says a nuclear war between Iran and Saudi Arabia is what caused the ""apocalypse"". 

It's also funny that what you attributed to the cause of the war is also what leads to life (or continuing to live) after the big reset. Even Max doesn't shrug this stereotype, though he kinda of falls in for the bigger individual vs. society discussion. &&I never thought of that before.&&I neber understood why he was called imortan joe.  Is it a bastardization of imortal?  Or something completely different?&&T H E   P A T R I A R C H Y&&Maybe i should watch you cause you're old.&&That movie had a DANK expository intro that explained EVERYTHING perfectly.&&[YOU CAN'T SEE ME!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-wZlsLZ0AE)&&Idk, maybe a movie with an explanation will help us? ;)&&Nah, she didn't know about the wives so how could she have used to be one?&&The first time I saw it in theaters when it ended I felt like 30minutes only had passed and it couldn't actually be over &&Right. Actually pretty sure that’s the “green place” of their original destination. The mothers later explain that they’d already passed through it and the soil had gone “sour”. 

But totally... the various people’s of the wasteland go basically unexplained, or only briefly. One can venture a guess as to the simple economies of Gastown and the Bullet Farm, and we get to spend a little bit in the Citadelamd see that it has a water system. We know that Furiousa has had quite a life, and lost her arm somewhere along the way. But nothing is ever spelled out and it never treats the audience as stupid. Of course I’m looking forward to the movie, but I am kinda disappointed that it’d be a prequel.

&&Then it shows up again in the third movie as the villain.&&Can you give any examples? Can't say I've ever hard this experience before.&&Like Life. &&Or even sequels: split. &&I think one of the most surprising of those types of movies is that final destination prequel. &&Like Better Call Saul&&>unless the movie is specifically about how they've changed to get to the point in the original story.  

Isn't that the point?

&&Not a movie, but Better Call Saul has SO MUCH character development it's scary.&&They could advertise it as a horror movie and make it seem like everyone is being killed by a monster (the Baba Yaga) and at the end reveal it was John Wick.&&That'd be a horror film. It'd be like watching Twister, but it being scary.

I haven't seen the second one yet, but the first movie was a disaster film, with Wick being the force of nature.&&Back in his original assassin days.

*""Mr. Wick""*&&Moments that i'd care about in that scenario i described:

 * Immortan Joe making a cruel proclamation in front of the dying tribe about HOW EXACTLY their children will be brainwashed into his warm embrace, how godly his seed will enter their daughter's bodies (this sets up why the parents would desperately suicide everyone) it has to feel both regal and incredibly disgusting 
 * Furiosa angrily shouting ""Witness Me!"", good acting can allow us to read it two ways. 1) she wants to 'fit in' desperately and she hates saying it [ANGER] 2) She's saying it to power through and show off to Immortan, because if she did not become imperator she might be killed herself [FEAR]
 * Return of the 'clean clothing' = innocent motif from Road Warrior/Fury Road. Pacifists are wearing white costuming running away from Immortan's guzzoline convoy. Stained Red as they die off one by one. 
 * Furiosa's Mother attempting to double suicide, Young Immortan just overpowering her and ripping Furiosa away without even trying. Leaving the mother to die in a pit (depending on how they want to de-age him, he could be a different, much stronger, much more menacing actor than the older Immortan... i call him Immortan Prime?) 
 * Subplot of Organic (or someone similar) making Furiosa's arm - and commenting about how it won't do her any good because she's worthless for breeding, and more worthless than halflife war boys if she can't fight for a damn. 
 * Remember how hard Nux tried to impress Immortan? At least one scene of Furiosa looking just as desperate to make an impression on Immortan. She's DRIVEN from the start, but misguided. This explains why she's so capable, but makes a turn for the good later.
 * The war rig, driven for actual war instead of escape, by a previous Imperator, a ruthless one. I assume due to plot purposes that Furiosa would end up driving it at one point and end up being the one of the things to impress Immortan. This time, the war rig never stops and is never defeated. The Pacifists would always be on the run, and the only way to slow the war party down is for the pacifists to sacrifice part of their convoy as decoys every time the war party gets too close. 
 * One long shot, a climax character moment for Furiosa as she climbs aboard the longest car of the pacifist's convoy. She has her 'Old Boy' hallway moment where she fights her way forward and wins on pure will alone and we end on her face gritting her teeth as she kills the last person on that rig (is this my Witness Me! moment? Maybe). It ends with her killing a mother and saving a child (for immortan). Good for you Furiosa, you've become your own mother's murderer - feel good? 
 * She should start out driving a small car, and slowly throughout the movie (through circumstance) drive bigger and bigger vehicles until her character's 'turn' and then when awarded imperator title, she slips into the war rig by Immortan's blessing. She should look disgusted when being passed that wheel. &&And they definitely knew when to leave things to the imagination. I mean, look at Lord Humungus. They don't give you any backstory on him, and it makes him a much more interesting villain&&Nanochlorians.&&Maxicarlions&&NANOMACHINES, SON.&&son&&they harden in response to physical trauma.&&Gasoline.&&It literally never occurred to me that they were talking about the ocean floor, crazy.  However, I always wondered where they were going to get the guzzoline to keep riding for 160 days.  Thats a long haul.&&1000 miles in a day on a motorcycle in the desert would kill just about anyone. &&Furiosa shoots a runaway through the back of the head. ""Click clack. There's your Kodak moment.""&&Less is more.

Unless you are talking about money, in which case more movies equals more money.

Some Hollywood nutjob is probably thinking about the Mad Max cinematic universe possibilities. 30 films in the next 15 years. Ready to turn everything into a slow moving sludge that makes them money.

Sometimes I wish I wasn't so cynical about stuff. &&[deleted]&&Go away, George && Very much so. They were both favorites when I was a kid. &&AAAAH &&Well, then you've got my blessing. I've been waiting for a time traveler to cut this bullshit off at the head for a while now.  Thanks, bro.  &&Ok, that was a stupendous distillation of not just what you can do with an unexpected Mad Max movie but the attitude that should be applied to all 'parallel storytelling' movies set in a universe we love but with characters we don't know (I'm looking at you Star Wars).  
  
You've got a solid basic outline of plot and motivation here with a few characters that can be developed into something fantastic. The concept of hinging the story on a slowly dissolving case of hero worship in world gone south is not only unique but offers some great possibilities for putting dramatic weight on the action sequences as the movie progresses. What do you do when the movie has no hero? Someone already in the movie has to become the hero!  
  
Motorcycle Machete Girl's grown up only knowing the world as post-apocalyptic and sees adventure in the world outside the safety of the village in a way that only a young, immortal-feeling teen can. She's always had excellent vision and keeps her motorcycle and weaponry in peak condition, revelling  in her role as a scout, loving every second she's out in the wastelands. The older people that established the stronghold and fought hard to maintain it, wanting to keep their children safe, can remember the world as it was and it's descent into chaos. She's respectful and disciplined but the tales she wants to hear from the elders aren't about the dangers in the outside world or the importance of checking in on time but the exciting tales of Max. The man without a village! A lone, capable force out in the wild. In tribute to her hero and true to way the characters speak in these movies with broken syntax and half-remembered phrases (""guzzoline"" ""kamakrazee"" ""they words it planet earth"") she has a habit of repurposing the phrase ""to the max"" and applying it to anything exciting. 
  
The Elder is like a godparent to the Motorcycle Girl. He and the other elders set up the village as far off the beaten path as possible. There are the occasional raids but usually by small bands of near-starving bandits. He lives in fear that as far away and as well-hidden as they are eventually someone will stumble across it in strength and numbers too big to fight against for long. Motorcycle Girl comes around often under the pretence of needing some bit of gear for her bike but just pesters him for stories of Max. He doles them out but no matter how hard he tries he realizes that she'll never understand how harrowing it was and at what human cost these seeming 'adventures' came. Here's some dialogue to set up a few things (with a meta-nod to the strange continuity of the Max films.)
  
Elder: ""It wasn't some great story like you think. It was bloody and hard and filled with death. The ones that made it here weren't the best or the bravest just the luckiest.  You're a great scout but, I swear, it's the only time your vision is clouded. Besides, I've told you all the stories I know.""  
  
Motorcycle Girl: ""But, you tell 'em different every time. There's always some bit you've changed or a piece that doesn't match up. Like where Max is now.""   
  
Elder:""I've told you where Max is now. He rode away. Likely dead. No one can survive out there. Not even him in that pipe"". 
  
Motorcycle Girl: ""Pipe? You said he rode away! What's this pipe?""  
  
Now we have a few threads to weave though the story you've laid out.  
  
The Mad Max series always had a few cool locations. Maybe the ""village"" is in and underground parking garage that survived the nukes (shades of 'Tomorrowmorrowland"") with families setting up in the car stalls like neighbouring houses. The surface building is mostly blown away, half covered by sand dunes and looks almost invisible from a distance keeping it pretty safe. Most of the few ways in and out are long tunnels or little pop-up trap doors, also used for snaring any lone scavenger types that come poking around. But one day a massive storm blows in and reveals the structure. The classic band of marauders spots it and starts closing in! 
   
Knowing they're vulnerable the elders send out a few scouts,  Motorcycle Girl among them. We see them ride their bikes through these long skinny tunnels and pop out of different exit points at various edges of the village. With her very good vision she spots the marauders first. A massive mobile army rolls in on the horizon. It's much bigger than the infrequent and small roving groups of scavengers she's used to. Looking across the dunes and noticing that her fellow scouts haven't seen them yet panic starts to set in. She knows she should get back into the tunnel and zip back to the village to warn them.  After a tense moment she yells out to them knowing that she's giving away her position. Sure enough a few of the attackers peal off from the main force and head her way. Motorcycle girl cranks up her bike and zips across the sand to help one of the scouts now embroiled in a dust up with the marauders, being chased the whole time. From the speeding motorbike she takes a few baddies out with some surprisingly deft use of the machete. Her immediate attackers dealt with, she smiles, losing herself in a momentary victory but glances up to see the other scouts getting slaughtered. She stops the bike dead.  
  
This is when it really sinks in. They're screaming and dying. Re-evaluating the scene around her she sees she's the last one on the vast plane between her and her home. And the attackers all turn their attention to her.   
  
Now an awful breakneck chase back to the tunnel entrance (bullets zipping past, a few cars smashing on impact with the edges of the tunnel as she squeaks in). Kicking the post holding the door open it slams shut behind her. A car slams through it but jams in the entrance. She speeds through the winding tunnel back to the village which is in a panic. A few of the marauders have gotten into the tunnels and are trying to make their way to the interior of the village. She finds The Elder. He's glad to see her back inside as safe as massive steel doors are being rolled into place at the tunnel adits. He tells her with the tunnels being too narrow to get a big vehicle in and most of them having intentional twists, turns and dead ends the invaders will have to come in on foot and hopefully get lost. 
  
 Motorcycle Girl tells him about how many she saw out there. Many more than they've ever had to deal with. ""I'm going to find him"". The Elder reluctantly agrees and gives her the sack of bullets and a vaguely described direction to 'the pipe'. Here's the first action set piece:   
  
They roll back the steel doors and Motorcycle girl rolls her bike in. The Elder says ""Keep your light off. You know these tunnels, they don't"" She says ""To the max"". (It's just something she says but, it's also WHERE SHE'S GOING. Heavy-handed, maybe but, hey this is first draft) One last look back she guns it.  
   
Cut to the outside entrance to the tunnel the bad guys are pulling the car wreckage out and the leader is calling for a bunch of nasties on  motorbikes and ATVs to go in.  
 The tunnel is lit by torches, some kerosene sconces and a few tall candles close enough together that you can see more than one but far apart enough that there are big stretches of pitch black (possibly enemy-enshrouding) unknown in between. Without giving a blow-by-blow of what happens there are a lot of exciting possiblities in this scenario: the machete being implemented with the speed of a motorcycle behind it, Motorcycle Girl using her knowledge of the tunnel system to smash invaders on quad bikes into each other, hell, dispatching a couple of motorbike punks can be told in a series of moments punctuated with the light/dark/light of travelling through the tunnel, and maybe end it with a Wile Coyote-style cave-in as she reaches the exit.  
  
This gives us something we haven't seen before. A Mad Max car battle mixed with claustrophobia. And don't forget she's still gotta outrun the rest of the gang once she's out there!  
  
That's just an example of where your excellent premise can start. You can have fun with the big bad being some kind of inverted version of Max (maybe he looks like some drawing Motorcycle girl made of how she imagined Max, calling her to question her beliefs) and pay off the 'scout with great vision losing an eye but somehow seeing with greater depth' thing.  
  
But, follow your outline and when, after a continual series of death defying chases and escapes she's lost her motorcycle and is nearly exhausted in the wasteland, she eventually discovers 'the pipe'. It's actually an old Quonset hut half buried in the dunes (shot and designed to mirror a smaller version of 'the village', reminding her of what she's been fighting for). She digs her way inside. No Max. There are some supplies, though. Guns, water, ammunition, guzzoline. Clearly someone did live here. Her eyes light up...  
  
Cut to: Exterior. The Pipe.  
Bursting forth in a flurry of sand and roaring like a beast the V8 Interceptor with our girl at the wheel, loaded with weapons and she's not coming back with Max, she's coming back as Max.  
  
**TL;DR** an expansion of the plot outline by u/TheDreadPirateBikke 
  

  

  
 &&When Lord and Miller were fired from the project, it was said that they made the character too funny and a lot like Ace Ventura&&2 Max 2 Furiosa&&id watch that.&&Patrolling the Mojave Almost Makes You Wish For a Nuclear Winter.&&That's what I love about Mad Max. Max is sort of a nebulous figure. For example, it seems like a lot of time has passed since society collapsed, but Max stayed relatively the same age until fury road where he was played by an entirely different actor. 
Max is a figure that wanders through the desert grappling with his demons, and is so lost and tortured by his past that he is no longer strictly a person, and more a spirit of the wasteland. Not like a ghost necessarily, but more an embodiment of Max's demons.&&I really need to watch these movies so I'm not lost in moments like these.&&Yes but he had a smile on his face when he left. I'm just being hopefully optimistic about his character arc &&...man, Trigun was awesome.&&Pretty much, except I don't think the Mad Max world has insurance adjustors. &&The man with many names.&&I would have liked if they cut down the hand to hand fighting and added more car stuff. 

Especially towards the end game, once you got rid of all the convoys and cleared the zone, there was virtually no car combat left that wasn't part of a plot. It would have been cool to have a zone which has convoys that reset forever. &&If you try doing everything it does get a bit repetitive. But you can plow through it fairly well before it gets too much so. It has a lot of potential for a sequel if they expand the gameplay a little more, and maybe add a survival mode that makes the food, water, and fuel much more important and hard to come by. &&Really my only issue with doing this kind of thing. Just write better woman characters. Just because you had a good one in a movie doesn't automatically mean they need a sequel or become the protagonist of their own movie.&&Yeah they'd attack, not siege &&Except at the end of Mad Max, he could have just left Furiosa to die and cross the desert. Instead, he chased her, came up with a plan to help her, and helped her accomplish it when he could have just left, he was scot free at that point.

He's a reluctant hero, but he's still a hero. He does go out of his way for his own sense of righteousness and justice. &&I think what he meant is that is highly likely kind of quick-hitting commentary most mainstream reviewers and I-haven't-watched-it-but-this-is-the-popular-narrative populace will parrot if they do decide to go with that arc.  I actually like the idea, but enough of a realist that it's bound to have its share of loud naysayers, much in the same way Doctor Strange's Ancient One casting (I'm ambivalent to it) was nitpicked to death.&&You can basically spin anything as sexist..becasue everything has a downside, and being too perfect will be called sexist as will being too evil, in between will be too weak or something else&&""Killed everyone I've ever met out here.

And don't forget water and ""mother's milk.""  &&I thought Joe's cult was centered around water. Loosely maybe?&&It's levels, innit?&&These subtleties made the film as incredible as it was. Everything was told within a singular narrative. Even Max's battle with madness was part of the journey instead of flashbacks and side stories.&&They didn't feel like it was explained because they weren't walked through every detail. It always irritates me when people give that as their reason for not enjoying the movie. If you actually pay attention to the movie everything seems pretty clear. 


That and the fact that the types of people that I've heard say they hated the movie are the types don't like/grasp subtlety. They want the entire backstory screamed from the mountain tops. They don't want to have to *think* about anything. &&One thing that kind of bothers me about a lot of blockbuster movies and most CBS shows is they train the audience to expect a giant neon sign to pop up whenever there is a plot or character development.  When they don't get the neon sign, they totally miss it.&&A lot of things in mad max are bastardizations of historical things.  Usually they aren't explained explicitly but I assumed he's an immortan because he's being kept alive by artificial means thus the bastardization of immortal.&&The backstory is that Colonel Joe led an attack on the aquifer (what would become the citadel) which appeared to fail ending in one of the towers on fire (with Joe inside). After three days Joe emerged and was dubbed ""immortal man"" by his gang. This was shortened to the title ""Immortan"". So Colonel Joe became Immortan Joe.&&Got 'em&&You should probably get off his lawn...&&Who said I was old?&&That music gives me chills. &&Made an account just for this comment.

This assumes the motorcycles can avoid the Marianas Trench and the like&&Unfortunately that's the film world we live in these days. With Warner Brothers, Universal and Sony all hoping on the cinematic universe bandwagon it seems like everyone is trying to cash in before it's too late. Universal already seems fucked but WB seems to be picking up steam and Sony, with the success of Spider-Man (with Marvel's help) look like they're going through with the Spider-Man universe movies. So that's where we are. No more original hits like Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, OG Star Wars etc... it's all going to be derivative bullshit until people get absolutely sick of it and stop going. Once beloved franchises will be run into the ground begging for their mammary glands to stop being squeezed. Audiences become so jaded that hours of mindless streaming content will completely replace their lives. Cinemas close, studios go bankrupt, the Hollywood we once knew becomes a lost civilization studied in liberal arts colleges for centuries to come. Visual art evolves into something we can't even perceive at this point in time. We're living in the collapse of an era. 




Or maybe I'm just being cynical.&&In film and literature the good guy never shoots first. He will *always* take the high road until the bad guy takes it to the next level and *forces* the good guy to kill him. This convention is why you were originally supposed to see Han as a bad guy who turns good. Greedo shooting first in George's bastard edit throws that out the window and makes Han's redemption less impactful.&&Aaaaaaah&&I accidentally caused 9/11

I'm too scared to try again, you're on your own&&Oh please no&&Oh jesus&&I chuckled at this. Sounds like a professional 90 minute long youtube parody or a 13 minute long master level YTP.&&*Johnny Guitar plays for the 357^th time*&&That's basically how I read it. And I loved that the video game basically implied that this was the case. In order for the universe to make sense, the events of the first movie must have taken place many decades ago, possibly hundreds of years. &&There are a lot of similarities to superheroes in this way. Mad max can live on forever played by different actors, and different writers and directors giving their take. &&Mad Max is basically Guts&&All Mad Max movies after the 1st one follow the exact same format.

* Max roams the wastes alone. He likes it that way.
* Max stumbles upon a group of weak good guys struggling against a strong bad guy. This conflict doesn't involve Max in any way and he would prefer to stay out of it
* Max gets roped into their conflict because he's out of options (needs gas/needs to get his shit back/gets captured needs gas *and* needs to get his shit back all at once).
* Max agrees to help the downtrodden but makes it clear he doesn't give a shit about their problems. He is only doing this so he can go on alone after he gets what he needs.
* Max and crew suffer a big setback. Max forms a bit of camaraderie with the downtrodden and now has a personal vendetta against the big bad guy.
* Now giving 110%, Max kicks everyone's ass in a huge battle and wins. The downtrodden offer to accept Max into their group, but he rebuffs them and rides off into the wastes alone again.

(This isn't a spoiler btw, it's very obvious that these movies are supposed to be a take on folk tales and follow the same structure for that reason.)&&Really wish it had been popular enough to get a full run rather than an anime original ending.&&I would totally agree with you, except that Vash got incredibly annoying to me as the series progressed. I understand the background for his personality, but damn did his absolute unwillingness to change his ways at all irk me and baffle me to no end. It got to the point where I was watching the latter episodes and was like, ""Fuck dude! Just shoot the fucker and be done with it! Problem solved! Move on!"" ..... I sort of wished that Wolfwood would become the new protagonist after a while. &&Was? Still a top 5 anime imo. 

Also im still surprised how good the movie came out like 15 years after the series. Was exactly the same and just perfect in every way. 

But yeah. My personal fav anime. &&I wished the race area was just open for races over and over. &&They ran out of money&&Yeah, I didn't like how the survival part goes out the window once your strongholds are improved&&It reminded me of the first assassin's creed in that respect. A lot of room for growth, some solid concepts, but it needs to be fleshed out more and the quests should be fewer with more differentiation.&&>If you try doing everything it does get a bit repetitive.

The bosses were literally the same with different skins.&&A system like Shadow of Mordor would have worked so well in that game. 

Minor Warboy takes you out and he gets promoted with unique weapons armor and car. Various warlords and underlings are constantly changing as you influence the world.  &&From what I read Furiosa's story was much bigger originally, but eventually Miller cut it down, as there was material for more than one movie. He still wants to tell the story, though.&&On one hand I kind of agree with you, especially for a series like Mad Max where each movie is really it's own thing and has almost no ties to the rest of the franchise.

On the other hand, how many strong women characters have a series of movies like male characters do? All I can think of are Ripley in the Alien movies and Sarah Connor in the Terminator movies. I'd add Wonder Woman in that category too now, but it's still a pretty small group compared to the endless male characters with their own franchises I can think of.&&How do you know furiosas character wasn't in George millers brain or down on paper?

Fury road was suppose to be made 15-20 years ago, but then the Iraq war happened.

The idea of furious could have been around for thirty years.&&Hoard&&for tea.&&America?&&I wish our desert wasn't shitty for fury road&&Master Blaster!&&[My favorite Basic Instructions comic almost made it so I couldn't write my own vows.]( http://www.basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2010/6/30/how-to-write-your-own-vows-rerun.html)&&Also food. The citadel is the only place in the area that has fertile ground and plants, somewhere there at the top. 

The war-rig was carrying a lot of greenery inside it in the cargo area also. &&Great point! You have a patriarchal takover of feminine principles like water and milk/birth and mothering. Similar to the modern Western churches who ascribe everything in creation to a patriarchy whilst forgetting that ""man was created in OUR image"". Insinuating that there was more than one being at work(male and female principle/positron and negatron). &&His power base over the masses is water, his control over the boys is all cult fanatasism. (Which is used to further cement his control of the water)&&It's levels all the way down&&It's funny to think about Mad Max being used as an example of subtlety but, here we are. &&which is why we're apparently getting a fury road prequel =/ &&He's called Immortan Joe because after the world fell, he took on an entire bunker and survived. People thought he was immortal. &&
Yup, Cause the real John Cena would never go undercover on reddit.&&Yeah that was one of my favorite movie twists&&That was beautiful!&&TIL Temple of Doom is a prequel.&&Temple of Doom is a prequel? How did I never know this... &&Ah okay. I'm only 25 so I didn't see it when it came out and I knew that already.&&Almost everyone knew Prometheus was a prequel to Alien. It was advertised that way. The fact that you missed it is fascinating. I wish I could have had that experience. &&Ya as far as Prometheus goes, I am a big Alien fan but I wouldn't have picked up on that. I just knew it was related to the Alien movies due to marketing/hype beforehand. &&> Split. It's a prequel/sequel to Unbreakable but they don't reveal it until the very end.

Aww man. Guess I should have watched that movie sometime before this.&&That was marketed pretty heavily as an Alien prequel I thought... I guess I am more referring to the audience being ""tricked"" into not knowing. I get that people will have random times they didn't know beforehand.&&Opening credits, the director, the production company, Weyland Corp - the clues were there! (Upvote anyway). &&The new one? I guess so, I thought it was marketed as a prequel but I can definitely see not knowing that going into it. I thought it did a great job too, but it helps that there was a story waiting to be told rather than coming up with something (not saying that's necessarily the case with Furiosa, just a lot of prequels in general)&&death 
&&Maybe Venom.&&Like Mike&&I don't know why you're getting downvoted. No spoilers, but I get it. It's surprisingly upsetting.&&Venom&&No&&I thought not, it's not a story the War Boys would tell you&&I've done a little over 500 in a day on a sport-tourer, and I was wiped out by the end of it. The people who do Iron Butts are just insane. &&You are being cynical because you are ignoring all the original hits lol.&&Han wasn't a villain though. Not a good guy yeah but most definitely not a villain. He's not saying Han was a good guy because he (in that argument) shot in self-defense I mean he was a smuggler hanging out in a cantina filled with some of the worst kinds of people. And since he did shoot first in the original cut, I'd say he was more of an anti-hero than anything. I would agree that even if he did shoot first it was still self-defense since Greedo had his blaster drawn and was going to shoot Han regardless. It only makes him looks less assertive if Greedo shot first&&Yeah definitely. I loved the videogame, I thought it was one of the best games that year. Shame it wasn't more popular.&&Sadly one of the comics they released alongside Fury Road seemed to imply there was an actual continuity between the films. I hope that's not true since it's much more interesting to think of all the stories as legends told in the wasteland that may or may not be 100% true. &&Mad Max is a ratchet James Bond. But in a very good way.&&He's supposed to be a folk hero. 

His story and the way it evolves is reminiscent to King Arthur. King Arthur was written in 500 A.D, but didn't really gain popularity until the year 1300 or so. King Arthur took on traits from the world as it evolved. His famous sword and the round table likely come from Charlemagne, The Holy Roman Emperor. 

So Max takes on the traits of the world he lives in. Think of him as a kind of timeless folk hero. &&I'm so upset that I've never realized this until now&&So it's spoilers for folk tales, too? &&perfect formula for any action flick really. &&the feels, tho. ugh.&&Wolfwood :{&&Alright, looks like I'm rewatching Trigun now. &&Their fund's were depleted due to their sizeable gambling habits&&I loved the game, but something felt wrong to me about the way the game played. I don't like unlocking things, and I don't like harpoons. Other than that, I think the world they created was wonderful. I just wish that you could unlock stuff by finding it, and that you could save by sleeping in your car or something. Also, I'd love to see a Mad Max hardcore survival game.&&Miller *really* wanting to tell us the story is what got us Fury Road, so fuck it; buckle up bitches.&&You're not wrong, but the issue is that they're just not making female leads. The answer isn't to just make sequels to make sequels it's write better woman characters. 

My real worry with this is they'd just write a mad max movie and essentially slap Furiosa's character on top of it instead of actually making a movie for the character.&&Alice in Resident Evil, but your point stands.&&For the hoard&&Whores&&[deleted]&&That's goddamn right!&&Zeitgeist meets Tumblr: the post.&&Also worth noting that all his Warboys are dying of one form of cancer or another. &&In a movie with a literal bandwagon.&&Why bother when you cant see him anyway&&I remember some time ago somebody made a post on /r/SquaredCircle basically saying if any WWE wrestlers read the sub they could slip the word ""apple"" into their promo on the next Raw to let us know. The next Raw comes on and Kevin Owens pops in to do his interview eating a.......banana. He doesn't normally eat things during his promos either. I thought that was pretty cool.&&Perfect way to end the series.&&Temple of Doom takes place in 1935, one year before Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Which makes the line Indy has in Raiders about not believing in magic a bit funny considering a year prior he spoke an incantation which ignited the sankara stones from inside a bag. &&It's explicit but not obvious, the years are printed on screen at the beginning of each movie, but if you aren't a big fan you probably don't remember what each said while watching the other.&&That just goes to show how thoroughly it dropped the ball as a prequel. I feel like it would have been a much more interesting movie if I'd seen it with no knowledge that it was related to Alien.&&I've seen the Alien movies but to me they're just movies. Also I feel like a lot of Hollywood reuses company or brand names in different movies like a running gag, so even if I did recognize the name I wouldn't have immediately got it. &&If you liked Unbreakable, you might like Split. I was disappointed the entire time, and then at ""the big reveal,"" I suddenly understood why it was such a disappointment the entire way through.&&Just thought the exact same thing, I love unbreakable and wish I'd watched split before knowing now. &&I was out of the country for a while and missed all the promo stuff. My sister convinced me to see it in theaters, I didn't know what it was about until pretty far on.

That might be why I loved it, and I'll defend it to the death. I had no expectations and wasn't immediately comparing it to one of the better scifi/horror franchises out there.&&Ah, I didn't know that. I try to not watch trailers or teasers for that exact reason, I prefer to go in with zero expectations and since I've started doing that movies have become a lot more fun to watch.&&They were indeed! I thought those were just references at the start (because same director), then it all clicked eventually.&&The thing (no pun intended) that pissed me off about that was the shit CGI.

*You studio fuckers already had pretty much all the practical effects built, why would you suddenly now switch it to all shitty CGI???!!!*&&Maybe i just wasnt aware when i saw it. I thought it was a remake going into the theatre.&&[deleted]&&Disproven, sorry. Would've been cool, though. &&personally I wouldn't call it upsetting, just 'dumb'. it's like somebody wrote the 'twist' up on a whiteboard and they just worked their way backward using dues ex machina as glue for every scene. &&I thought not. It's not a story the War Boys would tell you. &&Well yeah, Han was helping the protagonist on his journey so obviously he wasn't supposed to be a villain. He was just a bad dude. Not so much Neutral Evil as he is Chaotic Neutral-turns-Chaotic Good. &&Best vehicular combat of any game I've played. &&The ending though, what the fuck were they thinking?&&Damn u/braindamage05!  I was gonna read them folk tales sometime. Now they're all ruined!&&Stahp, ur gonna mek *me* CRY!!!&&You're not wrong, but I also think there's the potential for a pretty great Furiousa movie. I thought that character was awesome, and I'm pretty much sold on anything Theron is doing anyway, so why the hell not? 

I'm not saying do this *instead* of what you're suggesting, which you're absolutely right about, I'm saying do this in addition to just generally writing better female characters. &&Hodor? Hodor! Hodor.&&>-John Cena, 2017&&Whoredor&&**MASTER BLASTER RUNS BARTER TOWN**&&The magic is; even when you do come accross him, You won't believe it's him.&&apple&&That was just science dude. Magic science.&&Thank you for mentioning this. It's always annoyed me. I know it's silly, but it bugs me bad.&&I attended an Indy all nighter a few years ago and I still totally missed it. &&I still want a Prometheus that explores the architects, and why they needed to dissolve themselves to seed life. 

Cultural? Surely they had the tech to do it without melting themselves over a waterfall. &&i loved the movie. i thought that the main actor was incredible acting all the different personalities, and it was creepy as hell the whole way through. when you realise at the end that he is REALLY (won't spoil the twist) its even more terrifying and shocking, but you sort of expect that cause its an shamamalamaonlylasdga movie. 

the twist end where its a prequel was just icing on the cake. i just thought it was incredible acting and an amazing thriller. &&I really like Prometheus as well, but I'm easy to please, especially when it comes to sci-fi/space movies. &&Love it. I've started to do it as well. It's especially great for shows with the Next Time On and Previously On, I think they show too much. I love to be surprised and not have any idea where it's going. Even if it's something small, I'd rather not know beforehand. I don't try to push it on my friends though cause it can be painfully hard to not watch them haha&&No, and then. &&Fine, we'll have a couple sodas too!&&There was a twist?  I think i hardly remember anything from that movie.
&&Spoil me please.&&It was very dumb. Every character did the dumbest things, down to the littlest details. Like the Asian guy and the black guy both looking at the same set of dials, yet the Asian guy couldn't react until the black guy said something. &&He was so powerful and angry that he could use cars to create... new cars.&&The storms added a whole new dimension. Loved those epic chases.&&Agreed. The whole game felt really polished and it didn't have the most features or mechanics but what it did have really worked well. A lot of games shoot for the moon and try to include a thousand things and end up with a sort of half working mess.&&At least you still got folk lore to look forward to.&&Too soon&&don't quote me on that&&Tbf, im actually a sentient toaster&&It's not silly, it's just something that wasn't foreseen when Raiders was made. How could they have known they'd make a prequel? I tend to just think of it as Indy saving face, even if it is in front of Marcus Brody, a trusted colleague of his.

It's an important issue because the nature of the supernatural is imperative not just to the Indiana Jones stories in general, but to the theme of Temple of Doom. Out of the three Original Trilogy films, Doom is the one that places the most emphasis on respecting the power of the occult. Indy takes a very hardline stance against anything supernatural, an arc which is completed in the end when he admits to the village elder [that he understands the power of the Sankara stones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elehy4EIBjc#t=2m)

Between what Indy witnesses with the thugee cult, being brainwashed by Mola Ram, and the eventual revelation of the Sankara's power, Doom is as a study into Jones' character about how he comes to understand and respect what he encounters as an archaeologist. While all three films deal with this to some extent, Doom is the one where Jones makes the clear transformation from a skeptic to a believer. It helps reinforce why he becomes such an enthusiastic artifact-chaser So it's not silly to be upset by it, because as much as Indiana Jones is a very trope-like character, he does have an arc and a set of beliefs that visibly transforms across the films. &&It's way better than the hate it receives. &&And then!&&Just the very end, but you could already guess that leading up to it.&&Life Spoilers [ You think one ship lands on earth but it's actually the other one. And then presumably everything on earth then dies. ]( #spoilers )&&so yeah, spoiler:



the last two survivors go into separate escape pods. Jake's character was going to do the self sacrifice thing and lure the monster into his pod then override the controls and take it into deep space. instead, the pods hit some debris and the ladyfriend ends up going to deep space while Jake and the space octopus head for earth and are discovered by some fishermen. what a twist! &&Everyone dies, probably. And I mean, like, everything on earth.&&",2017-07-11 14:15:11

AMA IS CLOSED -- Thank you all for joining me here today and your great questions with many thanks to the r/movies mods for hosting me, Team Reddit and Team Val! Be well everyone!","Who do you feel is the most underrated actor you've worked with?  &&Hi val, 

Is there any role in any film of any era you would have loved to play?&&Thunderheart is a really under appreciated movie that has held up well over time. How different was it filming primarily ""out in the middle of nowhere"" (South Dakota) vs filming something like Heat in and around Los Angeles?

Thanks Huckleberry &&How difficult was the backwards scene in Top Secret to film? &&[deleted]&&Hi Mr Kilmer,

When are we gonna see you play a super villain for either DCEU or MCU?  

Can you tell me joke? So I can say *""Val Kilmer told me this joke once...""*&&Hey Val, I loved your portrayal of Doc Holiday, probably my favorite performance in a western. How did you prepare/how true to life do you think your performance was? Also kudos on the cup spinning scene &&You had some great stories your last couple AMAs, and I read one about Ozzy, but I was wondering if you have any about other musicians you have met? Thanks!&&What was it like working with Marlon Brando?&&Hi Val, 

Your AMA's on reddit are always a highlight to everyone here, so a big thank you from all of us for coming back and doing these!

With the announcement of Top Gun 2 it would be great to see you reprise the role of 'Iceman' and be one of the higher ups, possibly teaching a younger generation alongside Tom Cruise, what do you think? 

&&What's your honest opinion of all the Batman films after Batman Returns? Also will you be recreating the infamous beach volleyball scene in Top Gun 2?&&“Real Genius 2“ in the works?  Cause there should be. &&Welcome back Mr Kilmer,

I really liked the Prince of Egypt, and the story of Moses following the orders of God while also hurting from having to be against his brother was very emotional. I was wondering how it was for you going from acting to voice acting and what about both you like/dislike.&&How did it feel to see yourself on the big screen when you made your first film?  I'm going to see Top Secret! again tomorrow and I'm just as excited as the first time I saw it!  &&When did you know you were the man&&Val, what is a favorite film of yours that you have watched the most and why? &&Val! I love your work. You're my favorite Batman! Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was amazing. And Tombstone, of course. 

I was hoping against hope for a True Detective season starring Val Kilmer. Health issues aside, would you consider doing TV? Also, are you watching any TV shows lately?&&Always wondered about post edit audio in film. 
Are voiceovers/ADR something actors always have to do? Or does it just depend on the scene? 
(HEAT shootout for example)&&Thank you so much for taking the time to do this!

So anyways is there anything funny/interesting that you still remember from the making of The Island of Dr. Moreau?

And on a scale from 1-11, how would you rate your overall experience working on that film? We all know how bad it was, but it's been 20 years and I'm just curious if you look at the experience any differently now.&&How amazing was filming The Ghost in the Darkness?! What set working on that film apart from others? That has been one of my favorite movies since childhood. You and Michael Douglas were damned fantastic.   &&Can you call Warwick and do Willow 2?&&I loved you in Psych&&If you could do anything else besides being an actor/artist, what would you do?&&Hi. What was your experience like filming Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with Robert Downey Jr and Michelle Monaghan? &&Best kisser out of your on-screen love interests?&&Which Spider-Man villain would you like to play?&&Thank you for doing another AMA! I absolutely loved Real Genius as a kid and recently rediscovered it as an adult and it is now one of my favorite comedies. How was it playing a genius in both science and comedy? Did you ever learn about lasers or other projects the students in the movie worked on?&&I love your movies as well as your art. Not a question but I just wanted to say that Doc in tombstone really helped me get out of a deep depression. The line where Wyatt says, ""I just want a normal life."" You changed my perspective on life when you answered, ""there is no normal life. There's just life."" Thanks and I hope the best to you and everyone reading g this!! Good day!! &&Mr. Kilmer, what role did you not get that you wish you had to this day?&&I just read that:

>[Kilmer was originally offered the lead role in “Dirty Dancing”. He turned down the role because he didn’t want to obtain the image of a “hunk” in Hollywood.](http://www.10-facts-about.com/Val-Kilmer/id/542)

Would you say that worked out for you?&&Back in the day, you had something of a reputation for being, shall we say, ""difficult.""  Do you think that was a fair assessment?  What's your side of the story?  Example here: http://ew.com/article/1996/05/31/val-kilmer-makes-enemies-hollywood/

Thanks for any thoughts you might have.  Loved you in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film that deserves more recognition.&&Can you give us any insight as to what your role is going to be (major/minor) in The Snowman?&&Will you steal my idea that you should do a music album where each song you sing is from the different perspective of characters you've played? You've always had a great singing voice and songs by Madmartigan, Iceman, Nick Rivers, Batman, Chris Knight, Mark Twain, Doc Holliday, Iceman, Gay Perry, and Batman would sell like hotcakes. 

I promise to buy 3 copies.&&Would you ever do a sequel to The Saint? &&The Salton Sea is an awesome movie and you give a great performance. Any fun memories or stories from the shoot?&&How do you feel about pineapple on pizza?&&Hi Val if you could return to one previous role for a sequel what would it be? Personally I would love to see Dieter Von Cunth again!&&**Who would win in a duel, Doc Holliday or Jesse James?**&&Hi Val,

I really enjoyed watching you act with your son in Palo Alto. What was it like being on set with him? Any future upcoming projects with him?&&Hey Mr. Kilmer, loved you in Red Planet. My question is, any regrets playing Batman?&&Hey Val, two questions here:

First, you played Jim Morrison and Batman, two huge pop culture icons, so which one was your favorite and most fun to play/prepare for?

Second, I've heard that Will Forte is great and so much fun to work with, any thoughts on that from Macgruber?&&no questions, just wanted to say that Doc Holiday is such an amazing character and you played him so well.

and this scene is still one of my favorites.  every Doc scene in Tombstone is amazing, but this is one of the best.
http://i.imgur.com/VWg33Z1.gifv&&Do you ever watch your own movies and do find you critique yourself or are you able to just enjoy the movie? &&Hi. What would be your dream film project to act in? &&What was it like working with Wil Forte? Do you enjoy Macgruber as much as I hope you do?&&Hi Val - what made you get into abstract art and stencils? 

Thanks!&&Will you be popping up in the Psych movie?  Your cameo at the end of the show was fantastic!&&I just want to ask. Have you ever have had a dream where you see yourself standing in sort of sun-god robes on a pyramid with a thousand naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you? &&I have a giant crush on Cate Blanchett.  Have for 20ish years now.  Like seriously she can just take alimony from me and I'd be perfectly fine with that.

You've met Cate Blanchett.  How glorious is she?&&The Saint has some great moments, but quite alot of the film seems to be you and Elizabeth Shue breathing into one another's mouth. Did it get weird?&&Hi Val,

Without getting too personal, how is your health these days?

If you wouldn't mind a second question.  Do you have a favorite BTS story from one of your movies?&&What's something people should know about you that no one has ever asked you?&&Hi, Val, my friend. 

I just want to dedicate a few words to you and send you all my affection and support; I know you have compelling reasons to make certain decisions; It does not matter what people say and think; Surely the people who really love you and appreciate you, understand you perfectly and will always be there, supporting you, regardless of the decisions you make. I only hope and pray for it and that life will smile at you enormously, with a smile almost as beautiful as yours, to you and your loved ones; You, sweet man, and your beautiful heart, deserve much, much Love and Respect. 

I hope very soon you and your Doc Holliday will ride together on a beautiful horse through the meadows that surround Tombstone.

Now, a question for your AMA:
What is the most important lesson or one of the most important lessons you have learned in your life?

XOXO&&Favorite movie of 2017?&&Was playing Wyatt Earp in [this film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Earp%27s_Revenge) a strange experience for you? And did you find yourself giving the actor playing Doc tips on how to enhance his performance?&&Hey Mr Kilmer,

Big fan of your movies but I wanted to ask about your abstracts. I think they are mesmerising and I experience  pareidolia in many of them - sometimes figures, sometimes compositions, but its always instant rather than absorbed.

Anyway, onto my question - do you see things in your abstracts or do you keep it pure abstraction? Does it ever influence and change the course of a painting?

Thanks.&&How did you get Jim Morrison to play himself but let you take all the credit? &&How much popcorn was actually used to film the end scene in 'Real Genius'? &&Hi Val. First off, I think it's really cool how much you are on Reddit. I appreciate you mingling with us commoners. 

Batman Forever came out when I was in the 6th grade. I was at the age that any Batman could have come out and I would have loved it. Well, maybe not Clooney's version. Those nipples made young me feel a little awkward. But even looking back on all the flaws that Forever had, I loved it. I saw it in the theater several times. I was at the point that I was even putting Batman down as my name on all my school work. My teacher was cool about it and played along. Then I hit eighth grade and watched The Doors over at a buddies house and you became even cooler! Batman & Jim Morrison!?! 

I guess I don't really have a question. I just wanted you to know that you hold a special, kind of odd place in my life. 

Wait! I do have a question! What music are you listening to lately?&&Hi. How did you find filming a cameo for the show Entourage? &&Hi Val, 
do you have any plans to do something behind the camera(produce, write, or direct)?

Also, whats your favorite comedy movie?&&This will get buried and you probably won't see it, but I just wanted to let you know my brother died last week at 29 and one of our favorite lines from cinema to quote was ""I'm your huckleberry"" in the duel towards the end of Tombstone.  I saw a rerun of it by chance last night and about lost it when I heard that line.  

Thank you for being the actor that you are.  Your impact may be greater than you can ever understand.  &&Your 'Living Room' series is amazing! Love your usage of colour and how some seem to glow. What is your process to create those?&&Monaco Grand Prix, 1999.

Never got to hear what you had to say when Gerhard Berger unplugged Martin Brundle's microphone as a prank.

I'm sure you've been waiting years to tell everyone your thoughts, now's your big chance.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy7uk7MOeF4&t=4m2s&&Hello Mr. Kilmer,

What was it like making Top Secret? That's a comedy staple at my house. What did you learn the most with it being your first movie?&&Hi Val
My father is 80 years old and just loves you in Tombstone.  That is all he talks about.  Anytime that movie is on he will watch it.  He just loves your acting.
&&After your role as 'Mentor' in True Romance did you know Quentin Tarantino would have the impact that he did in the film industry? &&Hey Val, Saw you do the Mark Twain thing in Pasadena, it was awesome! Your knee brushed my knee when you were walking through the audience and the show just got better from there.

Anywho, my question is: Would you mind blindly attaching yourself to my vigilante-noir film so I can finally sell it? If we could make this deal on reddit rather than going through agents, that would be cool. Thanks for your help!&&Thanks for entertaining all of us for years, and for constantly coming back here to interact with your fans. What was your favorite movie to watch as a child, and how did it influence you in some way later in life? Thanks for stopping by!!&&If the good people working on the GOTHAM show approached you to have a role in the series, would you consider it? The Superman-related television shows have done great things with incorporating actors and actresses who played prominent roles in prior versions, even having Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder involved. It would be great for this Batman-related project to follow suit.&&No question,  just wanted to say Salton Sea don't get enough love.

&&How and why are you the greatest actor of your generation?&&Of all the characters you've played, who do you feel is the closest to your own personality?&&Mr. Kilmer - My mom is having surgery July 31 to remove her esophagus because of cancer. My father is a huge fan of yours. 

He is worried about the love of his life.  My parents have been married for 57 years.  My dad needs cheered up.  Could you please send me a message to show him that says you will be his huckleberry?  This would brighten his day so much.  Thank you.&&Would you do another shirtless volleyball scene with tom cruise?&&Well I just finished a one man show, so....&&HAMLET. I worked on it for 10 years before I believed I had something original to say and my aim was to go off to small Broadway. Well I started of perfectly happy at the Colorado Shakepeare Festival, with a wonderful cast and director. I was able to use the desgins I had in mind and the music which included my old frien Peter Gabriel and Public Image Ltd. and other at that time wild ideas for Shakespeare. only thing was, I was so content with what I created I never got back to it. Every year for about the last 20 I've wondered if now I'm finally too old... But I would have liked o have made a film of it since the best one out there is MEL GIBSON'S in my opinion. Clearest text, most dynamic performance, altho Mel always plays a bit for the tears to flow... I think Hamlets not as noble as he played it and not as sweet.&&I love the Native Lands. Even the Badlands. So mysterious and powerful. Plus I lived in a home on the res so I go the full dose. Great great people, the Lakota. Thank you for mentioning it. There should be more native American films.&&Let me reiterate. I came here to post this as well. Thunderheart was amazing and needs more love and attention. Well done, sir.  That is all.&&we had to practice forever. And I had to get divers certified for the fist fight remember? Hard to do in the middle of London.&&Movie version (backwards): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXlucE4iUDE

Watching that stoned melted my head. &&I'd love to be the bad guy altho wait till you see the SUPER. my first pscho thriller. I'm a baddy there my friends.&&At first I thought you were talking about Birdman :P
&&How do they communcate in prison? Cell phones...&&""So, Val Kilmer told this guy I know a joke...""&&I prepared real hard is how. Shot my 45 daily for months and my double action Colt 38 which happened to be the guns Billy the Kid used so I was very familiar with them, having played him. And the old Winchester. I'vealways owned horses but rode stiff like the southern militaty did. That was a drag. 6 months on the dialect. I don't drink so I just hung out with my step dad and my landlords whenever I could. Whew. Contact...&&I loved the line ""You're no daisy.  You're no daisy at all.""  
I also loved how your death scene had you laughing because your boots weren't on your feet when you died.  I'm not sure how many people understood that.&&Once I met Michael Jackson at a fancy Hollywood Hills party. One of the great agents of all time, Sue Mengers, thru a grand affair and everyone was there and my girlfriend at the time was, ahem, Cher. So even though the joint was jammed with every Jack Nicholson you could IMAGINE, the front door opens and a BREATHTAKING BLOND slinks in. Thats the only word, breathtaking. and everyone immediately starts to turn, and behind her in walks MICHAEL, at the height of THRULLER, so the stars all but applauded at the sight of him. And time stars to really slow down now because it was a ramp they curved into the living room down, and as they decent, he passes her and is now gently pulling her, his eyes, it seemed LOCKED onto mine. Its all too bizarre because up until then I'd only met about 3 genuine superstars and I was dating one of them, but even as I am trying to make sense of what I know cant really be happening, is happening, he finally throws his free hand up into the air, and yells, (of course) ""CCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEERRRRRR"". He was looking right through me to my date who i finally turn to and shes totally dropped her cool to an kinda yodells back like she does,""Michael"" or it might have even been Mikey, I sweat to God. She gets up for him, and they hug forever, leaving me with the blond godesses with the same look on our faces I'm sure which said, ""I don't really understand how I am here, but I am here, so I'm just going to act this is normal for as long as I can. Well in a flash we are all sitting together kind of ontop of each other cuse theres no furnture available I think they were each on and arm of the armchair, or it was a sofa and others ejected themselves so the royals could catch up. Michael was almost insane about her. I loved her so much. I guess cause when they worked together it was still the Jackson 5 and probably because Cher and he probably shared the same lightning quick humor and fun about evrything. so now theres a parade, like a conga line of people waiting to pay their respects, but hes not rude to people like Quincy Jones, or Meryl Streep but hes just not involved with anyone but her. Finally theres a break, and Michael looks at me and smiles. He was a really open hearted guy, and I wasn't a fan of the music so it was easy to talk to him. He looks down at my gigantic socks, hand woven as I recall like Jane Fonda work out leg warmers... and he says ""OOOOhhhh those a nice socks. Where's you get those socks?? Arent they nice socks?"" The bombshell nods.Then he starts to pet the sock closest to him. ""Yes those are lovely..."" Have I mentioned they were an angelic pink?I am wearing giant pink socks and Michael Jackson is petting me because they are in front him. In my deepest classically trained theater voice I respond as deep as I could,""My girlfriend gave them gave them to me to me."" He whirled around and asked her all about them and she complied with glee. They made each other very happy and everyone else. So the night moves on, they get up and make the rounds. I suddenly have 50 new young friends. Michael eventually returns, the bombshell has vanished, and he invites us over to his house, right now. Now I mentioned I wasn't a fan but that doesnt mean I didn't know the order of evrery song on that beyond hit record. It was the law back then. So the idea of going to his house was truly exciting But Cher, always full of surprises, said ""no no... some other time....blah blalh blah..."" I was pretty easy going back then but I'm pretty sure I made it very clear I was the man in this relationship and Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson want to move the party and want us there, well, lady witht the big hair all over the place and all the sequins, WE ARE GOING...
But we didn't go.
Eventually she told me, I think months later, that she felt very very sad for Michael but that he had lots of personal challenges and she didn't want to go to his house and be reminded of them. She didnt gossip but made sure I understood that the dad and other issues made it just too sad for her. Poor Cher. Poor Michael. 

I wish I still had the socks. Altho they were as large as a pair of uggs. What was I thinking... She had me under a spell that Cher. But at least Michael petted my ankle. That happened... &&Dream of a lifetime. even tho he could be as cranky as an old witch, he had just had someone murdered in his house and I was getting divorced. He helped me enormously get thru that and i'd lke to think I helped him&&They are being understandably quiet about the script, but I am sure its going to hit every note its supposed to after all these years!&&If we don't get another volleyball scene I say we boycott Top Gun 2.&&I'e enjoyed the same ones that have made the franchise a multibillion dollar affair. I've always wanted all of them to be more like Bob Kane intended however. Altho its hard to fault Tim Burton for his originality and talent. Even tho his Batman wasn't very Batlike. Poor Ben Affleck got saddled with a Batsuit made out of a Sherman tank. Didn't quite understand that. And I love Christian Bale but how does wearing the suit entirely change his voice? I'm just sayin... &&I pitched it forever 15 years to Brian Grazer who produced the original. He would always smile that wonderful smile of his and do nothing. Now I hear they are pitching a tv show without me. oh well. Don't know who's pitching it. So don't go attaching Brian. He and I made some good movies since then, like the Doors.&&""Real Genius 2"" with Val Kilmer and Elon Musk&&Mr Kilmer, can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?&&Well there were 5 directors and my oldest friend in Hollywood Jeffrey Katsenberg, so it was a cherished moment evrey day. And the cast was a dream. And your two other producers are Steven Speilberg and David Geffen. And I got to play God. &&i'D SEEN ALL the dailies so I wasn't suprised, altho they did slap an awful lot of make up on me for no real reason. What were they covering up? It was fun. An old tradition in LA is to go around the the director and producer and cast in a big limo and hit as many screenings as you can. The best was WESTWOOD. The laughs were so huge.&&every year its gets clearer and clearer, but I think the first inkling was when I was about 4... 3 or 4... &&Dont have one really. I usually watch KISS KISS BANG BANG for a while if I come across it cause its so funny...&&I'm working on a secret tv sho actually and about to sign a deal for my own production ideas as well. If you can't beat em, buy a house in Bali...&&Always. Except with Werner Herzog... I have a film out to him right now but its a secret. Its so much fun. He makes me laugh so hard. Its just how interesting his mind is and that wonderful demonic smile. And he's so polite and so opinionated its remarkable. But you just go with it. Hes a maestro.&&I loved it. I loved Marlon Brando and had a ball with him everyday. And I got David Thewlis into it when the other actor dropped out when the director got fired. the replacement director was kind but old and desperate for a comeback and every great suggestion Marlon or I had he slammed, so Marlon sent the whole thing up and just made fun of it all. I begged then to shoot the docuentary which would still be making money today. I shot over 200 hours of video but it was stolen. Hours and hours of Marlon and me. I am pretty sure I know who did it too but he has to live with himself and his Karma. I think he did it for someone else and it was destroyed so there was no incriminating reality of how poorly the set was being run... Thats a fact.&&I have loved Africa like a family member deeply since early childhood. So to be able to live on a secret Rhino sanctuary in a tent where giraffes lived next to us and would come and drink out of the pool next to us, and to have my friends drive up from Jo-Berg, and everytime Michael flew in he would bring POUNDS of caviar!!!! Crazy. And he has so many perfect and beautiful stories about old Hollywood. And don't forget it took him 15 plus years to produce ONE FLEW OVER THE COOKOOS NEST, after optioning it from the Broadway play his dad was in... C'mon! and all the lions!!! imagine 6 lions roaring at night. every night. I made the mistake of asking to feed them once. the real mistake was I asked if there was a chance he could take my hand and forearm off if he felt like it and without hestitation his trainer whispered, ""Hell yes. It's a bloody LION mate."" I can say its the most fear I think I have ever had on earth. the second most fear was also involving a lion but I'll save that story for next time. Also Cindy Crawford came to visit and thats always a fond memory. What a woman. And I got to know Nelson Mandella, a man with so much love I weep easily just at the thought of his gentel gaze. Like a holy man. no not ""like"" a holy man, a holy man. It was a special time. Plus the English director foolishly cursed the river one day and I quietly offered that cursing Africa, altho not something I beleived in personally overall,but that was a very very very bad idea and that he should really take it back. Well he was young and cocky and shouted it right back and much more and much louder. When the rains came, soon after, it washed away our ""movie"" bridge in about an hour, ENTIRELY, and 3 people almost died saving been swept off the cement bridge. True story. The whole crew witnessed it. Never curse the river in Africa. Well just never curse. Not worth it. HOOO boy not worth it.&&if its a short call, maybe&&If a studio can find a budget for the Emoji movie, surely someone can find one for Willow 2.
&&Yes, this is what I want. &&You hear about Pluto?&&A once in a lifetime performance.&&journalist and try to be a healer&&The best.

I was about 12 when Willow came out and that was when I developed a fetish for women with swords and armor. 

&&all of them&&I did! so much fun. Got to visit with one of the great physicists, Feynman, at CalTech. And our advisor was brilliant, and from Los Alimos...&&Well thank you&&The lead in FULL METAL JACKET&&There is only one PATRICK SWAYZE.&&I didn't do enough hand holding and flattering and reassuring to the financiers. I only cared about the acting and that didn't translate to caring about the film or all that money. I like to take risks and this often gave the impression I was willing to risk their money not being returned, which was foolish of me. I understand that now. And sometimes when you are the head of a project and the lead actor is usually the reason a film is being made, unless its a superstar director, then its only fair to make people feel good and happy they are at work. I was often unhappy trying to make pictures better.&&Not to deter a response from Val, but he [addressed this question in his previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/67qzrx/hello_reddit_i_am_actor_and_artist_val_kilmer_i/dgskqgf/).&&Its all about Michael Fassbender's character Harry, who's a detective back onto a serial killers trail after it going cold years ago from when my character had the case. I'm just about at the end of a long career and drunk all the time and everyone thinks I'm crazy. Tomas Alfredson did an amazing job of bringing this international hit novel to the screen. Such great poetic and interesting camera work, amazing cast, look it up. So many beautiful people! I look a total mess tho but I LOVE how my character looks. Tomas even found my weird tie.

It's called MARK TWAIN and MARY BAKER EDDY check my web site valkilmer.com for details. And I am also going to direct it.
After that I would love to do some big fun comedy ensemble with a cast like Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, Dowmey, Fassbender, Ryan Gossling and Daniel Craig, Forest Whitiker and Daniel Day Lewis.

But I am out there, LIVE, so come on by the next show or event and see for yourself how I am doing. Truly I am happier than I've ever been in my life. Altho its a great memory to go back to when your kids were babies and did everything you said 100% of the time. It only lasts a second, but when you get to say, ""Get over here and kiss me.."" and they do just cause their dad said so, pretty happy times...&&I'm also curious about this.

Its a really fun show called ICON GO ON, I'LL GO ON&&so many precious memories. There were 3 directors. 2 brothers and and an Abrams. They had all been together since college in Michigan so always finished each others sentences. God we laughed. Plus it was London, so I would go walk the streets and see the big tourist sights. I was shy but I'd try to talk to the girls... London girls are about 30 steps ahead of American boys so I was blushing quite a bit... I am still friends with one of the grips, and our head make up man designed the face of yoda, and put as much make up on me as well, so theres that. Filming at famous Pinewood. Incredible.

But I guess my very very favorite film before I was 10 was ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, followed closely by CITIZEN KANE. What a whopper!&&I've got some free time in Feb...&&Reminds me of a story Rob Schneider told:

“There’s a writer that I know, he was meeting Steven Seagal for the rewrite of ‘Under Seige II’. And so he goes into Seagal's trailer and he’s waiting in there for 45 minutes, sitting there by himself.

Finally Steven Seagal emerges from one of the other rooms in the mobile home and he comes out and said “I just read the greatest script I’ve ever read in my life.”

“Really who wrote it?” the writer replied.

“I did.”&&Well... don't keep us in suspense, who is it!?&&One of the best most under rated actors of our time.  &&You're friends with Peter Gabriel? How I envy you. &&I love that you referenced Peter Gabriel and PIL ;)&&There comes a time in every man's life when he awakes and, quite reasonably, he says to himself: I shall never play the Dane. &&>But I would have liked o have made a film of it since the best one out there is MEL GIBSON'S in my opinion. Clearest text, most dynamic performance, altho Mel always plays a bit for the tears to flow... I think Hamlets not as noble as he played it and not as sweet. 

An excellent adaptation for sure, but Kenneth Branagh's version is just epic and being the only unabridged film version, it is the best. 

Quick edit: Love your work! KKBB and Tombstone are among my favorite movies.&&Honestly, this is one of my favorite films with you in it, aside from Willow. A friend of mine introduced me to it, she is half Lakota Sioux and i am thankful that she did. I loved the chemistry between you and Graham!&&Val, come spend more time in New Mexico!

You've always done an amazing job portraying pain in a graceful, yet evocative manner. The absolute sickness you conveyed as Doc Holiday has stuck with me for years.

While waiting, Frank decided to show off by shooting a cigarette out of a stable hand's mouth (which in Frank's mind was ok because the guy was black). I'm proud to say that my great grandfather told Frank that if he did so he wouldn't shoe the horse and he could leave town on foot - and Frank capitulated. Under the circumstances and Franks reputation I'd say that was pretty ballsy. I like to think it's a true story, since my grandfather had no reason to lie to 8 year old me.&&> Doc would dust him before he knew what day it was.

Since I will likely never get another chance to tell you this... thank you for the truly amazing portrayal of Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"". I'm not a huge fan (of The Doors) but I am a musician and respect their contribution. YOUR portrayal was so spot on. I have trouble telling you from Jim when watching any video with him in it. You captured every nuance of his character. Very few actors spend the time to study and become the person like that, they seem to get just the major things, and that's close enough for them and the concerned parties.

Then one of the actors says that Val was really rude and demanded that his lines get changed and didn't take things seriously. That Val always acted like he was way too cool to be there and constantly told the director what to do. &&This isn't my video, and I certainly wouldn't agree with the title.

Personally I'd like to see val Kilmer as mephisto.&&But.. the movie is already in theaters!&&Don't think you can limit his range with your technicalities! &&Screen acting guild rules prohibit name confusion.

Even if someone named their son Val Kilmer (because they were huge fans) and he went into acting, he would have to adopt a distinct professional name to prevent name confusion.  More over, the only way for there to be a *Val Kilmer Jr* or *Val Kilmer II* would be if Val Kilmer had a child he named Val Kilmer at birth.

It is more strict than how trademarks are handled.

This is to both prevent confusion (""Oh, no, we meant to contact *that* Val Kilmer, not you,"") and also to prevent riding someone else's coattails.&&Thanks for being so cool. You're awesome ❤&&dude you should do this album! or maybe more your style.... paint some badass arts from the perspective of your various movie characters. that'd be a really cool series, i think! what would iceman paint?&&Someone else asked him about The Doors in his last AMA....I LOVED his response and wanted to share with you in case you didn't see it.


I had opera at Julliard, and a decade of SERIOUS vocal training to do Shakespeare, so I would go work with Michael Jacksons vocal coach in the morning proper vocal training to widen my range, then play him tapes of jim screaming and singing live. Drove my man insane. He would try to change it and I would always have to explain to him, ""No this is the way we want it."" And every day for months I worked with Paul Rothchild the Doors only producer, and their engineer, recording whole albums of the DOORS. Our aim was to make it so good I might be able to have some songs done live in the film. one day I freaked Paul out so much he went outside and refused to work. he was red hot and wouldn't look at me. eventually when he calmed down enough he said, ""I don't know who told you that story because I was the only one there..."" It turned out the song Paul had put up I hated and didn't want to record it, or at least not that day, and apparently what i said was so exactly what Jim had said to Paul when they were supposed to record it that he freaked out. It was too much for him. spooky. I tried to explain i wasnt acting its just how I felt about the song. so i went for a walk giving Paul a chance to regroup. when I came back i though of something to keep Paul animated and working and I rushed into the booth and said, 
""PUT UP THE END...""
He quietly told me no, because I couldn't sing the end. we got in a a mild fight and eventually he said he didn't want me to get down about recording or my singing but he finally offered his trump card, 
""""Val, you can't record it. No one can. Jim couldn't even do it. He only recorded it once and thats whats on the record...""
""Put up THE END... It's all right.""
So he did. 
And I nailed it.
And Paul was weeping almost immediately so i had to look away but he added that extra emotion to my performance. I messed up in 2 places... 
When Paul could finally talk he whispered, ""Val, I sweat to God, Jim blew 2 parts and we had to drop in to fix them. They are the same places in the song..."" 
People have often spoken in a different kind of language about this particular performance, which i've always thought was because of Jim's mythic interests and Oliver's feeding that angle in the press. But any actor will tell you this kind of thing is what we do. That when you do your job, and really commit, and you are Lady Ophelia, you can really smell those flowers, and you really have memories of floating around that stage, right out of your mind... But its just the blessing of acting. It's not possession, its just a reminder of what we all can do with our minds, if we are open, and willing. We can do anything. I can't sing like Jim Morrison. He's a baritone tenor. So is Elvis. Thats about it for rock and roll singers. But I sing every song live in that film. Except for some second of a scream Paul was particually attached to that Jim did, I think it was on WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER.

RDJ is Tony Stark.&&That's going to be insane&&It really is crazy to think about the fact that nothing like this has ever been done before. Like regardless of anyone's opinions on the MCU, it has been a hell of an experiment and just phrasing it as a 22-movie arc really puts into perspective just how impressive it is what Marvel has been doing for the last 9 years.&&I feel like the power of the infinity Gauntlet Thanos uses will opens up a lot of doors for a soft reboot of the universe, a la the DC crisis plots. Itll be interesting to see how the newer characters and arcs transition to the next phase.&&DO NOT FUCK THIS UP FOR US SONY

Be good.  Keep the Spider-man characters in the MCU.  We want to see Tom Holland be 30 and getting married to Marry Jane and fighting Carnage in the 6th and final Spiderman film.  &&I can't wait for the Tournament Arc!&&This really shouldn't be surprising anyone as it makes a lot of sense. The first wave of Avengers can 'retire' while a new team takes up the reigns. Captain Marvel will probably be the new Avengers leader with Dr Strange taking up more of a prominent role and Black Panther as well. 

I'm hoping they add She Hulk to the mix. She's an awesome character and would be incredible (hah) to see on the big screen. &&So weird being this far in... I remember seeing the posters for Iron man and thinking ""hmmm I liked the Iron man and x-o manowar game, I'll go see this"". No regrets.&&What I really respect about the MCU is that they planned for an end.  It was clear the moment the Infinity Gauntlet came into play...they literally planned for a 20+ movie story arc, and somehow have been able to successfully and profitably execute on that entire arc.  This never looked like it would just whimper on forever until the money stopped coming in.

I'm not a biggest fan of this franchise, but mad props to this kind of planning and execution.&&Well Renner has actually gone on record saying he is up for however much more Hawkeye they throw at him. So I'm not sure where Renner saying he is ready to be done comes from?&&I don't feel good about MCU not taking a break at least for couple of years after Avengers 4. I have started to think that they'll play it somewhat safe in Infinity War movies to have a smoother transition to Phase 4 (if thats what they are going to call it). I would rather have them worried about fantastic ending of this arc than worry about movies after it.&&Does anyone have the complete list in chronological order?&&This is going to get buried, but lately I've been thinking of the MCU more and more as the Tony Stark Cinematic Universe. Seriously - the Stark family has had their had in everything from Captain America to Ant-Man, and now Spider-Man. Iron-Man assembled the Avengers. Iron-Man saved the planet at the end of the 'The Avengers'. Iron-Man created the main antagonist in the sequel, 'Age of Ultron'. Etc.,  (I could go on for a while, really). 

I think Tony is going to die in Avengers 4. That's the only way to wipe the slate clean and start something new. Otherwise it'll continue being the Tony Stark Cinematic Universe. 
&&As long as they don't fuck up Captain Marvel, they should be good.
The new Avengers line-up will then be:

Spiderman,
Dr. Strange,
Ant-Man,
Wasp,
Black Panther,
Vision,
Scarlet Witch,
Quicksilver (Firmly believe they will bring him back, Marvel could use a speedster to liven things up),
Black Widow, 
Hulk,
Hawkeye,
Falcon,
Winter Soldier,
GOTG,
Adam Warlock

Fucking insane&&So I imagine it'll be the 'younger' generation moving forward, with Peter Parker/Spider-Man spearheading the group. 

Common in the comics, we already had/have *Young Avengers*. or *New Champions* in the comics. There is always the younger group that comes in after the old original guard.

Interesting to note about *Young Avengers*/* New Champions*, they all have some connection with the previous Avengers of course, and several are direct descendants.

Stature is Scott Lang's daughter, there was a young Vision who kinda had old Vision's imprints, and Billy Kaplan and Tommy Shepard, who are Wanda's twin sons reincarnated (it is...a very complicated story).

Wonder if we would get MCU the next generation like that, hm.&&I can't believe I got to grow up with this movie franchise. I was 10 the year Iron Man came out, and I'll be 21 when Avengers 4 is released.  Marvel will really help define the future image of the 2010s, especially for people who were my age. &&Can't wait for the 22 movie special pack collectors edition!&&As someone who hasnt watched many of these movies, how exactly are they all connected besides having characters crossover? Is there actually a connected story line between them all?&&The culmination of all the **RISKS** Marvel has taken.&&I'm about 99.9% sure that Spider-Man Homecoming 2 will feature The Hulk. 

Why?

Well Marvel can't use him solo so he has to Team-Up. 

He's a scientist like Peter and Tony so they have that thread, he's a surrogate father type too (gentle and patient) which is always good for a Parker Arc. 

It could be that Osborne Industries wants to clone/steal or restart the super soldier program which means General Ross and Co. popping up. 

Could explain Green Goblin creation. 

Everyone loves a good Hulk and Spidey team up. One brings the muscle and rage, the other the gymnastics and sarcasm. 

Perfect mix. &&A ""22-movie arc"" seems just a tad stretched thin.&&Just saw the new Spider-Man film and I think Marvel will be just fine.&&whatever the new arc will be, i hope Chris Evans comes back again. &&Please let the Doctor Doom rumors be true...&&I think we can all agree Cap is going to die....(Chris evens's contract is expiring after Avengers 4) &&Will it ever end?&&Somebody please tell which marvel movie of the 22 they thought was the absolute best and why&&I would love to see them explore the other characters in the armoury at Marvel.

I'm expecting mostly fresh new faces for the 2nd and 3rd wave. I'm also wondering if the general public will still be interested in the franchise after they've gone on for so long?&&If you've read Infinity Gauntlet [all the super heroes that challenge Thanos die, which in the comic included the Hulk, Thor, Ironman Captain America, etc...~~not Spider man though~~ EVERYONE DIES!!! =)](#spoiler) 
&&He ""dies"", then if the rebooted Iron Man isn't successful he'll suddenly be alive again.&&I bet he retires.

RemindMe! 2019 &&I liked Justin Hammer, i dunno if that counts&&Yeah, only Loki , Red Skull, and Vulture stand out to me. Other than that, that is like 3 for 22.

Edit: I think Zemo and Ego were pretty solid too&&Purple man in Jessica Jones?&&While not in the same class as Loki I liked Bucky, Pierce, Yondu, Zemo, Ross, and Klawe.&&Ego was pretty good.  &&Iron Man Revolutions with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Tony Stark and Zac Efron playing Pepper Potts.&&They are not recasting Tony Stark,not for a long time.Someone else will be Ironman.&&And it's only going to get crazier.&&And I just realised...that if you really think about it...it is all because of  Jon Favreau&&The influence it has had on the industry is amazing as well. I'm no movie historian but I can't think of a series of films in my lifetime that has had such an effect, so many other studios are trying to start up universes and franchises and become the next Marvel.

People used to joke that any film that is popular enough better be ready for a sequel because you know they will want to make more money. Then it seemed liked trilogies were the cool thing, make three times as much money by getting the audiences to return. Now its about creating a world of films that can have an infinite amount of sequels and spinoffs that can capture an audience and build upon it until just the recognition of the franchise will get people interested.&&Don't forget also filling in gaps with Agents of Shield tv show that gives you the info on what is happening behind the scenes at Shield while all this is going on.&&And I thought KRULL was going to do this back in 1983. Silly me.&&I'd feel cheated with that I want the mcu phase 4 to focus on the world after infinity war without rebooting anything &&Whilst that idea is a little Deus ex Machina in its conception I'm sure Marvel could execute it in an interesting way 

I'm not opposed to a soft reboot providing the characters are depowered or they become irrelevant in the MCU; I could see the Gauntlet opening up storylines more akin to GOTG or the Cosmos. I just pray it won't involve shameless retconning!&&Well considering they already announced the venom movie with carnage that has absolutely no spider-man tie in, I wouldn't hold your breath&&I just hope they wait a bit before recasting some of the bigger names, even if it's technically ""new characters"" wearing the same suits. If losses occur, they need to be felt for a while, and they need to impact the world they're a part of.&&She Hulk would fit better in the Netflix TV shows, I reckon. She's more day-to-day stuff in between her hulking out. But she'd also be a cool bridge between the two - appearing in the movies but also having her own TV show would be a neat link rather than the super tiny unimportant ones they have between AoS and the movies.&&> with Dr Strange taking up more of a prominent role

Cumberbunch is in very high demand - I'll be impressed and surprised if they can get him for more than three movies, and he's already going to be in Ragnarok and Infinity War&&It is not an end though. There are still more  movies coming as part of their second ""arc"" and people will watch those movies regardless of what arc it is. They are whimpering on forever until the money stops coming by introducing this idea of different story arcs consisting of many movies.&&Avengers 4 is the end of Downey, Evans, and Hemmsworth's contracts. All 3 of them of seem excited to be done based off different interviews. I imagine that gives marvel freedom they've never had in regards to iron Man, cap and thor&&[here you go. ](https://i.redditmedia.com/emv4vPbu2v2jgrt8rJ-xVHAHIMJ1k5Nc4G6gM5buu0w.jpg?w=320&s=cf0c440590d9a0ee71c813fda24d9018) 

Proper viewing order is of course a heavily debated subject though. &&Tony stark is the Wolverine of the cinematic avengers&&They went all in with Tony because he's the OG. It's hard to look back and understand that Iron Man was a ridiculous, last resort, all or nothing risk. When Marvel made Iron Man it was the do or die moment for them. And it just so happens that RDJ is so damn perfect at portraying Tony. I agree though, he's the keystone to everything that isn't GOTG (and even then I'm sure I missed some connection). It's perfectly ok for RDJ to want to hang up the jersey and it's ok for Marvel to take things in a new direction. I've loved just about every minute of the MCU but it has to keep fresh to remain the powerhouse it currently is. &&Everyone says they want people to die, and I'm sure some will, but goddamn am I gonna be sad to see them go. &&> Iron-Man assembled the Avengers

  
Nick Fury assembled the Avengers.&&I've always been scared of phasing out Ironman because he brings the comedy part to it. But with Strange, Spider-Man, and Ant-man that shouldn't be to much of an issue. &&But wouldn't Thanos have to kill Vision for the infinity stone that keeps him alive?&&What's craziest to think about is the James Bond franchise has only 2 more movies, and that's been going since the early 60s.&&Oh God. I'm old. &&At first I was like ""god damn these kids making me feel old"", then I remembered I was about 12 myself when the first Iron Man came out. Time does fly. &&It's the discovery of the Infinity Stones. [Spoilers for most MCU movies.](https://imgur.com/YVlmw9V)&&They all take place in the same continuity with a little bit of dialogue and the occasional cameo connecting them. While largely self contained, events in some of the solo movies will affect the big picture or set up events for future movies.   

A lot of the movies so far have been introducing infinity stones, or stones that have immense power, which will eventually be collected by Thanos in avengers 3 & 4, uniting the whole of the mcu to defeat him.  &&I have a bad feeling that it'll stay that way till the very end.&&I mean.. We're at what, 16 already? &&At this point, it's a TV series on a larger budget.&&They're not. Fox owns the rights to Doom and the Fantastic 4 still. &&The Winter Soldier was the perfect second chapter that brought a literally 95 year old character into a new century. It made Captain America modern, and cool again. The harsh political themes, including invasion of privacy in the age of technology, and government agendas, brought a complete shift from the well respected first movie. The tonal shift was only compounded upon through the use of action, and the amazing score by Henry Jackman, which introduced a brand new atmosphere.&&Iron Man. It was fresh, original, the perfect origin story, and laid the groundwork for everything that happened after it.&&Lets say one of these was coming out in theaters tomorrow, this is how advise on each 
(I haven't seen Spider-Man: Homecoming yet but everything I hear is that it falls somewhere in either Tier 1 or Tier 2) 

Tier 1: Go pre-order you opening night ticket right now

* Captain America: The Winter Soldier

* Iron Man

* Captain America: Civil War

* Guardians of the Galaxy

* The Avengers

Tier 2: Watch it this weekend at the very least

* Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

* Doctor Strange

Tier 3: Good enough to spend the money watching it in theaters. Waiting till discount Tuesday wouldn't be a bad idea though.

* The Avengers: Age of Ultron	

* Iron Man 3

* Captain America: The First Avenger

Tier 4: Could probably skip the theater. Its worth the rent/buy once its On-Demand 

* Ant-Man

* Thor

Tier 5: You're really not missing anything but if its on TV one Sunday afternoon, you won't regret watching it

* Iron Man 2

* Thor: The Dark World

* The Incredible Hulk



The thing about the MCU is that even the bottom tier movies, though forgettable, aren't exactly a regretful time. 

&&""Bury them in a shallow grave out back next to Edward Norton and Terrence Howard""&&[deleted]&&At least you guys got off the boat, High school of the dead stopped at a cliffhanger and then the author died last year (RIP)&&What about HxH......&&I would love to see Peter on jury duty where a criminal he busted is defendant and keep lying about the encounter with Spider-Man.

Makes sense...doesn't he possess the soul stone?&&It must be getting mad expensive to keep Robert Downey Jr. Coming back by now. He was up to like $50 million for Avengers 2 IIRC, and that was a few films ago now.&&I think most of the new movies Marvel's been putting out have been tests of the public's tolerance for new faces and lesser-known heroes. Judging by the box office returns, people will see anything Marvel puts out regardless of whether or not it ties in some way to the Avengers.&&[That's not true. Thor, the Hulk, Firelord, Drax, and one other hero doesn't die when they confront thanos in the infinity gauntlet series. And Spider-Man does die. He gets beaten to death with a rock by Lady Thanos.](#spoiler)&&Oh shit, you just gave me a great idea for what might happen. Right now it seems Warlock won't even appear until GotG3, which is due for 2020, after both Infinity War 1 and 2. How could they bring in Warlock if he's going to miss Infinity War? Because he won't. It's a longer game.

Infinity War will be the MCU's Empire Strikes Back. Thanos wins the Infinity War and all the old heroes die as their actors' contracts expire, and room is made for new heroes. No more ""Why didn't the Avengers take care of X?"" problems like during Dr Strange or GotG2 because Thanos will have killed them all in Infinity War. It will be a bloodbath.

Afterward Adam Warlock will fight the Guardians in GotG3 then get turned to good, and realize he has to take on Thanos, and the newer heroes join him, and eventually defeat Thanos. But *after* Infinity War.&&Sure but then whoever gets the gauntlet after Thanos is taken care of could just wish them all back to life right?&&Spider-man was killed by Nebula I believe. 

Edit: Ok, not Nebula, but some other blue lady.&&Hopefully they really kill SOME of the heroes so we can feel the stakes are really high this time. &&He didn't die, he was just in Tahiti.  It's a magical place.&&Captain America will die. :( Bucky will take over. &&You can't not like Sam Rockwell.&&Rockwell & the screenwriter just absolutely nailed the ""corporate weasel"" persona with him. I wish we could see more of him just because I loved hating him. &&I feel like Ego was at least a *little* more interesting than most Marvel villains&&>Other than that, that is like 3 for 22

3 for 16, I think you mean. Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War, etc. haven't come out yet.&&No love for Zemo?&&If we were counting the Defenders TV series, Kilgrave was incredibly evil and terrifying.&&Yeah, Red Skull was solid. I also really liked Ronan the Accuser.&&I still have hope that Red Skull will one day return 
&&Hammer was fun, tragic that he has not reappeared.&&Also Kingpin. I got goose bumps when he came back in season 2.&&2x for Yondu. Great casting. &&Everyone seemingly forgets about Obadiah. 

He didn't have a complicated plan and didn't have delusions of grandeur like other marvel villains. He wanted Stark enterprises and was willing to fight Tony for it. He was a smaller scale villain but the role was played well and the story was quite good. &&Couldn't tell you who Pierce, Ross, and Klawe are. As if I've never heard those names in my life.

Bucky has been more of an anti-hero, but I'd agree with you that as a villain in Captain America 2 he was awesome. Zemo was a unique villain for these movies, but I still don't think he was super memorable. For me, Loki and Ego are the only two villains who I remember and, more importantly, would love to watch again. &&No love for Taserface, huh.&&I would probably watch that.&&Do we get to see them bang?&&We're gonna need a bigger suit.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&He was so money and he didn't even know it.&&Thank god he was shit at ultimate fighting&&Jon Favreau is blind to that fact that he's money. &&All while writing speeches for Obama&&AND he has a recurring role as Happy Hogan! He's in there forever!&&I've seen some in this sub count *The Incredible Hulk (2008)* as the start of MCU since it had a post-credit sequence w/ Tony Stark.

Do we include it? 

Personally, it always felt like Iron Man 1 was the real beginning. The tone was set right there. I don't even want to talk about The Incredible Hulk, and the actor isn't even the same Bruce Banner! (although War Machine's actor would change too I guess)&&He's so money and doesn't even know it.&&The Universal monsters of the '30s kind of approached the concept, but of course it never approached anything like the scale Marvel is working at. I'm really interested to see what the long-term influence of this ends up looking like because it really is just staggering. &&> I'm no movie historian but I can't think of a series of films in my lifetime that has had such an effect

Star Wars?&&Not to be negative or anything, but you frame this as being all positive. For fans of marvel this MCU arc has been a success, but I find its effects on the industry have been largely damaging. Studios are scared shitless of bankrolling anything that they can't get multiple movies out of and huge licensing/merchandise royalties. I feel like the average quality of cinema lately has been absolute shit because studios are only looking to these sorts of flagship mega franchises to carry them. 

It's making for whole months of movie droughts while we wait for things to trickle in - then they release one film that they've bet the year's farm on and then back into the drought. I'm sick of sequels. I'm sick of mega-blockbusters. I'm sick of comic book heroes. I'm sick of the world being in a constant state emergency. It's all just one-note right now. 

I also feel that eventually even marvel fans will become burnt out on the extreme pace at which these films come out. You can't keep something like this going forever. &&I hate that AoS gets lost in the shuffle of the MCU sometimes. The first season or so was shaky while it found its groove, but the last two seasons...god*damn* they've been good.&&And all the other tv shows too. This has been a massive multimedia project and I'm constantly impressed with how consistently good it all is. &&Maybe. I mean, they're going to have to start writing off/recasting a lot of the core cast soon anyway, this just seems like a good opportunity to do so without having anyone whose contract is ending die off in the films.&&edit: Editing my comment because it seems that according to other users I am mistaken about the continuity. Please see those who have commented on my post for more information: I'm not sure what the current status of the canon is myself. Original post below. 

------------------------------------

Yeah, but the canonicity of it is weird enough that they might be able to pull off an MCU version of Venom and Carnage in the long run.

If I remember correctly, the official word is that the Venom movie is within the same continuity of the Homecoming movie, and the Homecoming movie is within the continuity of the MCU, but the MCU is not in the same continuity as the Venom movie. &&Production schedules are difficult to manage between movies and TV shows is the problem though. &&... you mean like a comic book series?&&Is there a good reason to stop making the movies?  It's VERY obvious that a vast majority of people continue to go to see them and enjoy them.  I sure as hell don't want them to stop.  What exactly is the problem with them continuing on until the money stops coming in?  It's not exactly like they've abused the characters or have treated the entire thing poorly.&&Rather bittersweet- sad to see them all go, but I'm curious to see where they end up doing other projects. (Snowpiercer, Tropic Thunder... I have high hopes.)&&It's to be expected but it's still really sad. These guys *are* the Marvel franchise for me and watching all their stories culminate over the years has been an experience. It's like Jackman leaving all over again and it pulls at my heart.&&More JPEG plz&&Both for good reasons, at least they aren't the cinematic Mystique&&I don't think the MCU will ever have a shortage of humor, in fact I'd be more worried about oversaturation. Pretty much every character has been used for jokes in some way.&&Age of Ultron proved it is possible, maybe even easy, for these movies to try to be too funny.&&Yeah but he can come back at the end if they show the Living Tribunal and he resets the mcu.&&And the James Bond movies dont even all connect in an ""arc"".&&Let's see,

* Incredible Hulk

* Iron man 1

* Iron man 2

* Thor

* Captain America: The first avenger

* The Avengers

* Iron man 3

* Captain America 2: the winter soldier

* Thor: the dark world

* Guardians of the Galaxy

* The avengers age of ultron

* Ant man

* Captain America: Civil War

* Doctor Strange

* Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2

* Spiderman Homecoming

Makes 16 but we've got still to come:

* Thor ragnarok

* Black panther

* Infinity war

* Ant man and the wasp

Not sure about the other 2?&&Only with a bit less continuity between episodes. &&For now, at least. For all I know, somebody at Disney could be eyeing that side of Marvel. &&It also works as a stand alone spy / thriller movie. Its not super over the top on the  comic book side of things. &&I like Mark Ruffalo but I really wanted to see an Avengers movie with Edward Norton.&&He got the shrapnel taken out of him at the end of Iron Man 3.

I think Captain Marvel will take Warlocks place since I think Mar-Vell has the soul stone and will pass it to Carol.&&I think that's going to get ripped out of his head to power the infinity gauntlet. There is no gauntlet without that stone in his head (there is, just missing one stone).&&It would be so nice to just write up a small ""per pic set value"" contract with him where he kinda just shows up as a cameo, of a ""wise, older Avenger"" type thing. Since the CG of the ironman thing isn't done by him, but is instead.... Well CG... He wouldn't need to do much. Sigh, man.... If only...&&Pretty sure he's getting $200m for Infinity War/Avengers 4. That's well-deserved, but fucking outrageous. It's like half the budget for casting the entire film(s)&&Pretty sure 50 mil is a drop in the bucket for Disney with that franchise lol&&Which is true... but is it sustainable for another decade? Another 2 decades? Forever?&&lmao why does that last part sound so funny to me&&I almost want this just for the ""villian kills everyone"" ending. It will just make Thanos' final defeat so much more satisfying&&> Oh shit, you just gave me a great idea for what might happen.

Yeah I liked him&&[deleted]&&It would have been more interesting if his motivation wasn't so cliche. ""I'm going to take over the universe!"" no you aren't there's too many movies left. If he had some sort of redeeming motive to taking over everything, like he wanted to destroy Thanos by taking control over everything, it could have put Peter in a little more complex predicament. They just painted him as a generic bad guy and we know he's going to lose because there needs to be more movies.&&Ego was cool, but I wish they had just defeated him and escaped rather than kill him.  It'd be cool to know that there are big bads lurking out in space that can come into play in the future.  Hopefully we get a new Doc Ock as well soon, because he's a pretty awesome villain if done right.&&Good point

&&Well Incredible Hulk came out a month later than Iron Man.&&Iron Man came out before The Incredible Hulk. It is the first movie, but both are a part of MCU.&&Iron Man 1 is the official start of the MCU as far as I know. 

Also I really liked Edward Norton as Hulk. He really nailed the Banner character. A more frantic, sarcastic take on the character than Ruffalo, though they're both good.&&I have the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase I boxed set and yes, 'The Incredible Hulk' is included. &&Is it too much to ask for a good hulk? A mark ruffalo hulk would be cool to see. Personally, I'd rather a third hulk than a seventh spiderman&&[deleted]&&It means that it will take studios that much longer to declare their movies a failure and move on to another concept. &&Toho's kaiju movies in the 60s did something similar too: Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra all started off with stand-alone movies, then Mothra and Godzilla had a showdown, then all three shared the screen to fight Ghidorah.  

Destroy All Monsters brought back those familiar faces, plus just about everybody from the Godzilla movies leading up to that point, plus some non-Godzilla Toho randos like Gorosaurus and Manda.  Destroy All Monsters was like the Infinity War of big-ass monsters.&&Now that Lucas is out of the driver's seat I expect we will see Star Wars movies for the rest of our lives. Also James Bond was the first to pull of this concept.&&Star Wars, while culturally and artistically important, still only has 12 movies in 40 years. The MCU was basically started with Iron Man in 2008 (I'm assuming that is the starting point to them at least) and will have made 22 movies in 11 years at the conclusion of Avengers 4.

The MCU is pretty...marvelous. ^^^^^^ha

EDIT: I'm going to clarify just what I mean. Specifically in terms of movies, the MCU dwarfs Star Wars. This is what I said in another comment:

>I never said anything about impact (in terms of culture), but there hasn't been a movie universe to churn out as many highly praised, commercially successful movies, in such a short period of time.

>One thing that MCU has done that Star Wars did not (mainly due to the format difference) is that the MCU has a bunch of singular franchises that come together really well. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America could have been their own franchises and would have been fine, but they were able to intertwine them all so well that you get more than just the big epic movies.

Not only have they done it, they've done it very, very well. Despite the seemingly adverse opinion to a lot of the posters here, the MCU has been ridiculously successful. Regardless of your personal opinion of the movies, their commercial success has been absolutely ridiculous.

I'm also specifically just referencing the movies. Star Wars is a whole different monster when including everything about it.&&The first season was difficult because Whedon was at the helm and knew what was coming with the Winter Soldier plot line and was basically handcuffed. ""Don't get too far out of line because the foundation you've built everything on top of will disappear entirely."" I've seen shows have to reinvent themselves before, but never that early on.&&The LMD season is some of the best TV I've seen this year.&&>   how consistently good it all is.


Ironfist has to be the exception.  Great story, bad acting and endless mcguffins.&&What I find strange is that they haven't tried video games at all. Some of the best things to come out of Star Wars are the video games, and I'd say there's a big overlap between the demographics that watch MCU films and play video games&&Ya, the Agent Carter to some extent, at least about some of the history. But not a lot of it played a part in what was going on current day.&&If they start recasting right away I think I'll lose interest pretty quick. 

I feel like characters need to die. Lots of them. For me that's the only way Thanos is going to live up to all the hype. At this point it's really all he can do to set himself apart from the other villains.

And of course they can come back to life later or be an alternate version of the character for any number of reasons.

edit: I typed words wrong.&&Tfw your movies are now existing in two separate timelines at once&&Also there's some like weird internal war going on between Marvel Films and Marvel TV&&Well unfortunately RDJ is trying to make a live action pinnochio and another Dr. Doolittle.

In the comics, Thanos loses it because he becomes incorporeal and takes on some sort of astral projection of himself without protecting his corporeal form, and Nebula in her zombie form steals the gauntlet, which gives Warlock his chance.](#spoiler)&&I feel like he will take the place of Lee once Lee is gone. I'm not the biggest fan of Ironman, bland I honestly never paid much attention to the character until the film's. But RDJ did such an amazing job that he has become the cornerstone of the MCU and is the modern face of marvel as a whole as far as a vast majority of the population is concerned. 

The only person who is comparable is Hugh as Wolverine. It feels like they were both born to be those characters. They fit then so well and it is largely because of them that the superhero film genre deserves respect.&&I think well-deserved is a bit of an overstatement. I mean, don't get me wrong, RDJ is a fucking incredible actor... but I just can't see a price tag of $200 *million* as ""reasonable"" for basically anything besides maybe singlehandedly saving the planet in real life. I get that they can't just nyx him and replace him since he's a huge part of the franchise, but it just seems... sort of wrong that all the other actors barely make a fraction of that and they play equally important characters.&&$12 billion gross from the box office so far, and that doesn't include merchandise, tv shows, and other huge money makers. I'd estimate well over $20 billion from the MCU, though of course that's very rough.

So ya, $50 million is fucking nothing.&&Doubtful. As far as trends go this one has stuck around for longer than most, but I expect fatigue will kick in within the next decade *if* Marvel can't shake the perception that its movies are more or less the same. 

If they take advantage of the post Infinity War era to start creating movies with smaller scopes and more character-driven narratives (more in line with their TV shows, or with movies like Logan) they stand a fair chance of keeping the franchise going, I think. &&because it sounds like thanos is cross dressing&&Plus think how much stronger they will be after training with king Kai all that time. &&I'm sure they'll find some backup power source or reinsert the gem to bring him back at the end of Avengers 4 because comic books hate permadeath. &&in a cave! with scraps!&&Apparently I've been living under a rock. This is the first time I've seen this.&&I wish marvel didn't stop making these cool shorts.  It really drove home the value in buying the blu-rays when they came out. 

Also, I was really let down that the people in that one heist short weren't cast members of the Agents of Shield show.&&I'm not the kind of person to vocally gasp in the theater but when Ego casually drops that bombshell, I let out a short little yelp of surprise. I didn't see that coming at all, though it makes perfect sense. Spoilers:

Peter *immediately* blowing him away was the sort of instant gratification you don't usually get in scenes like that. 0 - 100 in 2 seconds. There was no ""Wait, you did what? How? WHY?!"" It was just ""That tumor your mom died of? Yeah that was me, but le-"" **RAPID LASER FIRE**&&I will never stop loving scenes like the one where Peter shoots him a million times.

*""YOU KILLED MY MOM!""*&&It was only cause he was Kurt Russell.


And a German beach loving weird ass euro pop star. &&Darren Cross was unsettling, as well, and his Yellow Jacket fights with Lang were amazing.&&I feel like GotG2 set up like three different sequels for itself&&My line of thinking upon seeing Ego's plan was to imagine that Marvel has plans in case of them getting the movie rights to the F4 (or at least Galactus). In GOTG2, they refer to Ego as a celestial, and what does he do? He plants seeds throughout the solar system in order to take over planets (which would mean he could come back, reborn and in large numbers). And what is Galactus's purpose? To balance out the number of celestials in the universe by eating planets (which may or may not contain a celestial egg). If they never get the right to use him, then it just becomes another detail in that movie, but if they do, they have a seamless way to introduce that big of a character without it feeling forced...

 But that's just my take on it, and I would like to add that it is completely speculation on my part. &&Ronan is a good villain/foil *because* he is so comically (pun) one-dimensional and stereotypically ""evil"" to the point of being a caricature. In a movie like GoTG that is pretty self-aware, having the antagonist be played straight was a real smart move, because it provided a tone shift and good juxtaposition.  

would the very end of the final battle been as funny/memorable if Ronan wasn't utterly bewildered by Starlord? Nah. But Lee Pace played it straight the whole movie and that made it funny for the other characters to play off of. Film woulda been worse if Ronan was quipping/snarking the whole time just like literally everyone else. &&Mary Poppins? Is he cool?&&I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!&&I loved Alexander Pierce as a villain, it felt like Robert Redford playing the other side in 'Three days of Condor'.&&That was Andy Serkis?? I didn't recognize him without the green suit and CG &&Remake of twins with Kevin hart?&&I doubt getting X-Men is doable for them. Sony very well may be sold off if it keeps going the way it has been though. I think they could get the Spiderman rights for the cost of the profits from a few Spiderman movies (edit: in the event of a full Sony Pictures sale). So maybe like 750M? Maybe $1B. You have to base everything off Star Wars being worth $4 billion I guess.   

But X-Men would be a much larger price tag, and I doubt Fox would even let go of it. They need product. They aren't going to want to give up their main franchise. F4 might be worth a sale to them but not X-Men. &&I think most of these contracts expire if not exercised though. So if they don't touch F4, then it reverts to Marvel. &&Who's the wild man now!&&With big fuckin teeth man!&&r/unexpectedfriends&&Smooth dropping that $10,000 tip&&So nice of Tony Stark to help Happy out. 

Also, he was getting to fuck Black Widow. Bastard. I hope his taco truck burns down. &&[deleted]&&habe you seen chef?&&Can the reference be any more obvious!&&Friends of the Pod are everywhere. &&That seems so strange looking back.&&IIRC, the MCU as a concept hinged on (edit: The Incredible) Hulk doing well. They weren't sure what was going to happen, mainly because Ang Lee poisoned the well with his utterly piss-tastic version of the Hulk a few years earlier. The Hulk post-credits scene was added at the last moment, when The Incredible Hulk scored pretty well with test audiences, enough to chance linking it to Iron Man and a theoretical MCU. &&Isn't Norton just playing himself in that movie?  &&Interestingly, the same actor plays Thaddeus Ross in both Hulk & Civil War, o the here's some consistency there&&I'm hoping that Thor:Ragnorak will be like 50% Hulk sequel &&I'm sure Feige and Ruffalo would love to do a standalone Hulk film but the problem is the rights issue. 

Universal has the distribution rights so if Marvel were to make a standalone Hulk film Universal would distribute it which I'm sure Disney would not want. They've already making a deal with Sony I doubt they'd wanna make one with Universal too.&&Yep. We'll see how that works out, but I'm not super optimistic. It doesn't really look like they're doing them as horror movies which makes me nervous. &&[deleted]&&Universal said they were starting a shared cinematic universe with their Wolfman reboot, which bombed. Then they were starting fresh with their Dracula Untold reboot, which bombed. Then there was I, Frankenstein which bombed even harder and had a 3% RT score despite them talking sequels and Underworld crossover films.

Then again they wanted to start their cinematic universe fresh with The Mummy which bombed yet again.

Maybe they should focus with one good movie and a solid plan for something larger.&&They are, but I highly doubt it'll ever hit the heights of *Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein*&&I think Bond is actually the opposite.

MCU is a bunch of distinct IPs that share a universe. James Bond is a whole bunch of seperate tones and continuities that share a single IP.&&Bond never got any spin-offs or branches or ensembles, though. I'll love to see them try with Felix Leiter, who's pretty much the only major Bond-universe character who could carry a film.&&In hinsight, the First season is what makes AoS so good in the later seasons: It build the foundation for the main characters, especially Coulson, Sky/Daisy/Quake, FitzSimmons and May. 

And Ward/Traitor/SquidWard. Brett Dalton deserves an Oscar or something for his role as Hive.&&Plus they handled ghost rider good.&&Unfortunately Inhumans is being headed by the same person who ran Iron Fist. &&There have definitely been a few hiccups but with the amount of content they've put out you'd have to think there would be. The fact that there's so few is really incredible. &&I'd say Daredevil S1 is pretty good start-finish.  Jessica Jones likewise (though there is a little bit of a slide in the middle, it picks back up).  Daredevil S2 started terrific, went to good, and then seemed to be confused where to end.  ~~Iron Fist~~ Luke Cage was really cool until obvious spoilers happened and then I didn't care enough to finish it.

Let's hope they learned their lessons and Defenders is good.&&There were games for all the phase 1 movies, but I guess none of them did well and they stopped before Avengers. It is a shame though because there's some great potential for good Marvel games. &&Don't forget the Netflix group. Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Ironfist, and Luke Cage  give back drop on the 'everyday' and the fall out from the New York stuff. &&They must kill some of the characters off if they want to have the true big bad that Thanos is supposed to be. 

Avengers aways seem OP'ed in the movies.&&I think the only problem with recasting is how to do it in good taste without rebooting.

I want them to retire/die, let the legacy hero be the mains for a new generation, and then bring back the originals with a new face.

 I just cant see a good way to bring back the old characters ,die or retire, with a new face and not be jarring. Like these characters will get a good sendoff for that actors run, but then itll feel cheap to just have them pop back in with a new face without a reboot. 

Itll be weird if the recast Wolverine in one of the next X-Men films and act like nothing has changed since Jackman gave a great end to that character for that universe. But if they were to reboot completely then itll be easier to digest.
&&I blame Barry.&&Give me a third Sherlock movie.  &&He's rich enough and famous enough to not give a shit. I say let him do what he wants and if they are shit then ok. If they are good then ok. &&Yeah, but he's also got an HBO show and a Linklater movie in the works, so not all hope is lost. &&""You couldn't do that five minutes ago?""&&The Avengers 5: Age of the Dark Galaxy Vol 3 &&I feel like Norton and Ruffalo are perfect in their respective vehicles. Norton was more compelling as a main character, but Ruffalo is more likable and works well as a side character. Ruffalo is more charismatic and subdued while Norton had a lot more energy to him.

I honestly kind of hope they don't make a solo Hulk film with Ruffalo because I don't think it would be very good. And at this point I think we're well past watching a guy reluctantly turn into the Hulk to fight another Hulk-like bad guy. It would only work if they step into him becoming self-aware as the Hulk and even then it's just a guy being a reluctant hero.&&He got a mini-fridge installed&&He perfected extremis (which in the movie is shown to be able to regenerate limbs). This lets the doctor take out the arc reactor and shrapnel and extremis lets him grow the hole back. In the comics, extremis is modified so that he can organically grow his ironman suit from his body, but I think that's a little too unrealistic for people.&&Not once have they explained that and it bothers me so much. Part of his ribs are gone. &&I stopped reading 5 years ago because my blue balls turned to stone and fell off.&&Actually it could totally fit as a DD episode.&&no. James Gunn has confirmed that Adam Warlock will be a central character in Guardians 3 and wont appear before that. Adam Warlock is likely going to have to be replaced by either Loki, Vision or Doctor Strange&&The normal reader in me says ""wow that's a bunch of bullshit""

  But the comic reader in me says ""Yeah, I can't see any other way""&&[deleted]&&However, merchandising goes to Marvel Entertainment and not Marvel Studios AFAIK. So it doesn't directly go back to the same budget RDJ is payed from. &&> creating movies with smaller scopes and more character-driven narratives 

Literally Spider-Man Homecoming.&&Idk about that. Marvel has a huge pool of characters they can use. Comic book adaptions will probably stick around the same way book adaptions do. I really don't see Marvel burning out that pool anytime in the near future. They turned Guardians of the Galaxy into their biggest movie and that was some really obscure comic. As long as the story and character hold up they can still chug out movies in 50 years.&&""WITH THIS GAUNTLET... I CAN DO **ANYTHING!!**"" 

*Suddenly he's wearing a dress and a nice hat.*&&Yeah, really thought that was sick, and the fact ego is just so casual about it. It takes a quick beat to register with star Lord what he just heard, and the fight immediately starts. Was super happy with that.&&That scene reminded me of Han [immediately shooting at Darth Vader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxdLYWnSzpI&feature=youtu.be&t=2m30s) when he first sees him in Bespin in Empire.

And I loved it.

EDIT: it also reminded me of [Mal shooting the fed in the first episode of Firefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP9eiXMPLcQ) even though all he knows going into that situation is that he suddenly sees someone is holding someone else hostage and he doesn't know why and doesn't care and just takes care of it.&&This scene was really important to me. 

I lost my mom at a young age due to complications involving diabetes. Something like that, be it cancer or AIDS or what have you, leaves a very different scar on a person. If someone was hit by a drunk driver, that driver killed them. If they went to war and they got blown up by a mine or shot, they were killed. There is blame. Even in risky surgeries, you can try to pass the blame on the surgeon, even though it may not be their fault and they did all they could. There is a physical blame. 

When she died, I didn't know whose fault it was. Because every kid is looking for The Who done it. Who killed my mom. But the doctors didn't do it. No one killed her. She didn't even do it to her self that much. She just got it one day and then she was gone.

This scene where Peter shoots Ego. Picture Peter as every person who ever lost a loved one to something that could not be held accountable. Now picture Ego as a physical manifestation of that thing. The film says ""here it is, in a human form, do your worst."" 

When this scene started I was almost in tears. Fuck, I was in tears for the beginning of the first guardians. It brought me back to a bad place. But when the laser fire stopped I fucking screamed in joy and scared everyone in my close surroundings. Because if I was Peter you fucking bet I would fire until my clip was empty.

I guess to, me at least, this scene meant more than that. Maybe I am the only one.&&He was mainly unsettling because Corey Stoll is just really good.&&He was great, but he looked like an evil Jeff Bezos to me.  Still worked well, even in that regard!&&This so much. GotG2 was self contained, and could have functioned as the first movie in the series. It has the origin story, development of main characters story arc, all the makings of an episode 1. But, it wouldn't have hooked people into watching the next one. They needed a big sexy hook to get people to like this as much as they do, and the first movie they released was perfect. It needed some follow up, and that's why we got GotG2, and I agree that they can really go wherever they want from here.&&You gotta have a straight man. Basic tenet of comedy.&&Volume I was also meant to do char development and world building. Ronan would never make it past volume I. Making him a linear character allowed the rest of the characters and world building to be easier I suppose &&Yeah agreed, Ronan was the basic cookie cutter generic Marvel villain which made him work in the finale when they just took the piss out of him.&&Hell yeah he's cool! &&And now I'm sad. &&Robert Redford fucking killed, he was so believable as a person willing to do evil things for something he thought was for the best, or at least portraying someone who wanted to appear like that and simply wanted power&&the black panther trailer had Gollum and Bilbo having a conversation.&&F4 I want to happen more than X-men to be honest. there hasn't been a good F4, and Marvel could do *so much* with DOOM. He's like 75% of the value of the IP in my opinion.

Like... It's DOOM.   &&They won't sell X-Men you're absolutely right, even if Apocalypse was meh to a lot of people both First Class and DOFP were critical and financial successes, they'll keep on going with them. Plus honestly Marvel trying to now shoehorn the X-Men into their cinematic universe would probably be hard as shit, I think they're better off apart from one another.&&Not just X-Men. Fox owns mutants. The word mutant is Fox's domain. That's X-Men, Deadpool, X-23, Legion, New Mutants, X-Force, The Runaways, Dark Phoenix drama, House of M, even fuckin' Alpha Flight. There's a reason Marvel started calling traditional mutants Inhumans or enhanced. 

That shit is gonna have to expire before Marvel gets a sniff, like Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and Elektra. F4 is way more likely after the recent bomb.&&That's exactly what prompted the newest f4&&He finally blowed her where the pampers are&&If you don't know what's going on that's a fucking weird sentence.&&That fat fuck was sandwiched between Scarjo and Sofia Vergara... It's good to be the director.&&Makes Aglio e Olio good enough for Scarlett Johannson, too.&&Wah-PAH!&&This a Chandler bing impersonation for people who don't get it.&&Pivot! Pivot!!!&&Two different distribution companies too. Hulk was universal and Ironman was Paramount I believe.&&Just like any other crossover event at Marvel.&&Maybe. Who are we to judge?&&I really enjoyed Hulk.  The Incredible Hulk had quite a bit of action and such, but Hulk just felt like a better story.  I actually want to re-watch it now.&&[They were already planning on doing the Avengers by Iron Man 1, even with Iron Man's 3rd appearance being the Avengers. This is EW's interview with Favreau literally 3 days after Iron Man opened.](http://ew.com/article/2008/05/05/jon-favreau-talks-iron-man/)

**Tony Stark was in the Incredible Hulk trailers**. He wasn't added because of the testing. It was done due to marketing as a favor by RDJ and to be consistent with Iron Man, as TIH had more SHIELD before Norton rewrote it. It's on the freaking wiki page.**

Also, The Incredible Hulk literally mentions that the Hulk was partially made by the super soldier serum and the Abomination basically OD'd on it, and it's the same blue from both Cap 1 and Civil War. 

On top of that, SHIELD was supposed to be a bigger presence but Norton essentially wrote them out the story (largely why he was replaced). 

Iron Man was always #1, nothing hinged on The Incredible Hulk, especially since it grossed $264 million on $150 million. **They were always moving forward with the MCU regardless of the Incredible Hulk**. 

It posted a financial loss and they still had iron man 2 line up the Avengers film while casting Cap and Thor in 2009 to early 2010. 

By Iron Man 2, the Avengers was 100% going to be filmed, as the 2010 comic con had a hired-Joss Whedon introduce formally the Avengers lineup. 

**TLDR -- Iron Man was the basis for the Avengers and MCU. If the MCU depended on the Incredible Hulk, whether in terms of critical reviews or fan reviews, which were lukewarm, or commercial performance, which posted a huge loss, then there would be no MCU today. Favreau admitted that the Avengers would be the third Iron Man film/appearance only 3 days after Iron Man, and before Norton removed them, SHIELD was in The Incredible Hulk. The Stark cameo was added half to tie the MCU into it and half to market Iron Man, as it was revealed before Iron Man was released.**&&It's easy to rip on Ang Lee's *Hulk* (and very valid in many cases), but it's easy to forget that he had no template/style to draw on, the hulk is virtually impossible to do with practicals so the CGI dependence was a given, and he tried some really interesting concepts, something people on Reddit/general social media constantly whine about never happening because ""Hollywood plays it safe"" and won't ""let artists just be artists"" (whatever that means). &&> That's my secret, Cap  
>I'm always sarcastic.&&Isn't RDJr playing himself in the MCU?&&>I am Bruce's internal rage&&Exactly. Whether 'The Incredible Hulk' is part of the MCU isn't even up for debate. Also, the events of that film and the fate of the Abomination is addressed in a Marvel One-Shot featuring Agent Phil Coulson. 

Edit: spelling&&[deleted]&&I feel like the Marvel guys are sneaky with how a certain character's standalone film can be just as much of a showcase for another hero. Heck, Civil War was basically an Avengers sequel. They're definitely doing that with Ragnarok.&&Yeah I feel like they really missed the mark. I grew up on Saturday matinee buffets of The Mummy, The Wolfman, etc., and the Cruise film felt like it completely missed the spirit of the movie. The old horror movies weren't global catastrophe movies, they were, by modern standards, small and intimate. The horror came from the possibility that the mummy might be in the next room, not capable of destroying a city. The wolfman might be out there in the dark, looking at you, not trying to build an artificial moon to create permanent midnight.&&Yeah Leiter is such a badass. I was disappointed they barely used him after Casino Royale.&&Seriously, Ward = bestfuckingcharacter&&Also Ward! At the end of s3 I was like ""ok if Ward comes back as yet another persona I'm gonna flip a shit"" but then it was *so perfect* in the Framework. Amazing season all around.&&And ruined Dexter. 

I can't even bring myself to rewatch the first four seasons because of how badly the last few turned out, and it used to be my favorite show on TV. I'd be perfectly happy if people stopped hiring Scott Buck. &&Honestly, I don't know. In the last 15 years, only Batman and Spiderman games come to mind as being good. Again thinking about star wars, the best games are more freeform and not really based on the movies. Kotor, Republic Commando, Jedi Academy, Battlefront, and so on are games that happen in the SW universe but not really ""games of the movies"". So yeah, if they want good games I think they should just give the IP to a game studio and say ""make something fun""&&I like that Avengers get their asses kicked often actually, as humans do.

AND that Hulk is invincible, but can be brought down eventually.  I mean idk how I feel about that I guess.  (eventually beaten into submission by Hulkbuster)

Hulk being literally indestructible by any force imaginable, and only getting STRONGER with every possible attack on him is just, damn.

&&""Overpowereded""&&And now you know what it's like to be a comic book fan.  Welcome!&&God, please. A third Sherlock movie would be amazing. This is a longer wait then the third and fourth season of bbc Sherlock.&&He got that *fuck you* money.&&I call that ""the Eddie Murphy retirement plan.""&&""I hate you.""&&Could you move your seat up?&&Avengers 6: Dawn of the War of the Planet of the Trash Pandas.&&We still need a shot of Hulk doing delicate lab work then trying not to angry because he cannot replicate the proper results.&&Eric Bana was the Dr banner.  He was just poorly utilised in the 2003 Hulk.&&Bana 4 life yo&&Perfect size for a single can of Coke.&&It also let him be mentally connected to the entire Internet and every satellite in orbit, but that was used all of once for whatever reason.&&Actually it's just his sternum that's gone. His *true ribs* are still in tact but the hyaline cartialage that connect to the sternum are gone.&&I'm sure he has robot ribs and other robotic things working inside that cavity at this point. &&And then after he gets acquitted, DD breaks the guys legs.

Win-Win!&&He is also still the most successfull character. There hasn't been one MCU movie reaching the billion without RDJ/Iron Man in it after all. Many people are saying Thor and Cap are on the same level but when you see the BO, not really, their solo movies are much lower except Civil War but that had Iron Man and a big bunch of other Avengers characters.&&I heard its a start of the next period of movies.&&Oh yea, same. You're just shocked as he was but you're thinking why, how and Peter is just ""Ahhh hell no!""

I also love how later he looks Ego in the eye (before their big fight), ""You shouldn't have killed my mom and smashed my Walkman.""

As was said, all this fit with Peter's character. Screaming why, asking how, doesn't make sense for him. But shooting first, makes perfect sense.

And that Walkman meant a fucking lot to him.&&And him being so casual just shows how out of the loop he is with mortals. &&Reminded me a bit of Han Solo firing on Darth Vader in Empire. No surprise, no shock, just *bang*&&The whole movie was very reminiscent of Empire for me, from the hasty asteroid field getaway to the alluring false paradise. Not in a bad way though. &&His mistake was not firing from the high ground.&&I've just realised in watching that clip how Han not only shot at Vader almost immediately, he also moved Leia behind him to protect her in the same move.&&Kind of comparable to Inigo Montoya's revenge in the Princess Bride (Patinkin had recently lost his father to cancer when shooting that movie).

> Picture Peter as every person who ever lost a loved one to something that could not be held accountable. Now picture Ego as a physical manifestation of that thing. The film says ""here it is, in a human form, do your worst.""

I didn't realise untill now, but in the movie it's *literally* a callous self-proclaimed god who did it.&&Thanks for sharing. I'm gonna think of you wherever I see that scene. &&I can see that. We draw meaning from what we see.

GotG2 struck a chord with me because it resonated a non-traditional family. My father was an abusive, drunken shitheel, my mom was a narcissistic abusive shitheel. I kept clinging to the hope that one day one of them would come around and be a parent for me. When my dad almost died due to alcohol poisoning and sobered up, I thought 'this is my chance'... turns out the alcohol only made him slur. He was still an emotionally abusive prick.

So to me, Ego was like my dad. Peter FINALLY got a chance to have one of the few things in life he wanted, but it turned out to be a toxic experience.&&so just jeff bezos then&&>big sexy hook

Michael Bolton we're really gonna need you to focus up!! &&I thought Chris Pratt *was* the big sexy hook&&That big sexy hook is the leader of the sovereign mentioning Adam warlock at the end. As a fan of the GOTG comics that's just huge, and got me immediately hyped for the next one. &&I'm Mary Poppins y'all!&&Have you seen *Spy Game*? Not necessarily evil, but has a lot of moments of ""You do this because I said to. Not because it was right.""

Rooftop scene especially comes to mind. ""Don't ever question me again.""&&Doom, Galactus, Annihilus, Skrulls. With the Fantastic Four back they could really flesh out the cosmic side of the MCU.&&So much more than just Doom though.  Galactus, Silver Surfer, Kang The Conqueror, Annihilus, Super Skrull, Molecule Man, hell even Mole Man.  There's so many good characters they could get back and some of their best villains.&&Doom could be THE recurring villain of the MCU.&&It's really sad that even comic fans collectively don't give a shit about the Fantastic Four, they just want to see Dr. Doom done right - and they think Marvel's track record with their villains (which is improving lately, fortunately) are really the ones to make good use of him.&&I think it honestly all hinges on how homecoming does. If it destroys box office numbers then fox would be absolutely out of their minds to not do a similar deal with marvel studios for F4. 

Because all marvel studios needs is the door to be opened a little bit. &&Forget Apocalypse - Deadpool and Logan were both well received and were major hits. So at the very least, they can continue to explore r-rated superhero movies more easily than the other studios, and that can certainly help set them apart.

I'm still a bit hopeful for take-2 on Dark Phoenix. I think it's such a cool story, and if they do it well I could see it really revitalizing the non-r-rated X-men movies as well. At the very least they can't make it centered around Wolverine. And hopefully they won't make it all about Mystique either.&&Also they have at least two X-Men TV shows on their networks. It's too intertwined.  &&What the hell is Wah-Pah? &&Chanandaler Bong?&&I watched Ang Lee's The Hulk a couple months ago. I'll save you some time. Get a bowl of tapioca pudding and a block of wood. Watch those for an hour and a half, and then remember the time you didn't ask your high school crush out. You've basically watched the movie and recreated the disappointment at the end. &&*proceeds to morph into Brad Pitt*&&I'm told that the casting process for Robert Downey Jr. went something like this:

>""So we have this role for you.""

>""Alright, what kind of character would I be playing?""

>""We want you to be yourself with *slightly* more money.""&&Kind of reverse actually. Iron Man was RDJ's fresh start. He became Tony Stark and in response to that Stark became RDJ. They are one in the same.&&If I had gamma radiation poisoning I'd name it Marla.&&and referenced in Daredevil, AoS, etc. &&There's also a small amount of footage from 'The Incredible Hulk' playing on a monitor in 'The Avengers.'&&With a GotG scene at the end.&&Civil War *was* basically an Avengers sequel and it's a good thing it was. Avengers: Age of Ultron was a pile of shit. The Captain America movies have (in my opinion) been the strongest of all the MCU films, and Civil War being headed by Captain America definitely helped make it a good movie.&&>not trying to build an artificial moon to create permanent midnight

Definitely the last actor that really felt like Banner to me. That movie gets a lot of shit, and to be fair, has some bad parts and a few silly ideas, but my god, I don't understand the hate it gets. Those shots of hulk smashing tanks in the desert are orgasmic, and they did a lot of stuff that was really cool, especially for one of the first comic book movies.&&And therein lies the sponsorship.&&Depending on what era of stark we're talking about it may be a can of something more ahem *potent*&&Nah, he's storing a Pepsi in there so he can give it to Unicron to help the transformers with peace.&&Ever heard of Freakazoid?&&Pretty sure he fixed extremis and used to heal him, it's somewhat alluded to. &&Or solved that solution that causes people to burn up but also heal.

The only way to make a good villain is to work something up that spans multiple movies, rather than a one off.

Because I'd be stoked on that.&&Yeah, he's a primary Avengers villai. The issue is that he has some relations to the Fantastic 4 and so he automatically got looped into the Fantastic 4 rights. A LOT of marvel's good villains are at other studios, so it's had to make a universe with 2nd rate villains. But they made it with 2nd rate heroes, so I'm hoping they'll up their villain game before Thanos arrives. &&That's a good point about him not necessarily being cosmic. If they wanna use Kang, I'd say it's mainly important they use time travel. Which of course would be best done on Earth, where we're all familiar with how each decade/ era looks. No one knows what Xander looked like 50 years ago, and it'd be silly to make it look like Earth during the '60s.

I thought Dormammu was handled great, but he wasn't the actual villain in Doctor Strange. If (when) they make a sequel, Dormammu being the big bad could be awesome.

Kind of goes back to my point. Marvel has essentially turned Dormammu into Galactus, because they can't use Galactus. &&I'm very excited to not see ol' boy get bit by a spider again&&It was pretty great!they really built up a lot of the supporting cast and Micheal Keaton was one of the best MCU villains since Loki&&Lockheed Martin but owned by one person.&&Avengers 22: Venge Harder&&",2017-07-05 17:51:13

In the books the people are kinda doing it on their own. The people want it, they are so fed up and tired with everything they happily give up their freedom. It's a way more bleak and depressing vision with way more parallels to today's society.&&In a world, where there's only 3 michaels&&Different than what I was picturing.&&I wonder if Michael B Jordan is having Fant4stic flashbacks holding that flamethrower.   &&Anyone find it ironic that many of us will be watching this on large flat screen tv's...?&&Love me some Michael Shannon&&Not a fan of the design here so far, always pictured it in my mind as a disparately colored universe with minimalistic colors vs. an ultra saturated environment like Pleasantville almost. 

Seems they went with the cyber-Nazi vibe, kind of like the new Wolfenstein games, which look awesome, so I am still cautiously optimistic. 

&&It was a pleasure to burn.&&When I read the book, I got the feeling that Montag was a very quiet and deliberate individual. I thought that that was what brought power and intrigue to his actions. I really can't see Jordan pulling that off. I hope I'm wrong, or maybe I just didn't pick up the right vibes from the book.&&I honestly don't believe that they can pull off something as abstract as Farenheit 451,  since everyone imagined it so differently and it was worded so specially&&Fuck thats a lot of talent and charisma in one shot.&&Please be faithful to the book.

I'm getting a Fant451stic vibe over here.&&I'm curious to see if they skew the story from its original intent. When I read this as a kid I saw a tyrannical gov't. When I read it again as an adult I saw a society that was so sensitive and easily offended by everything that the gov't had to go to extremes to appease society. My older self sees it a combination of both.&&Oh good, I was planning to read the book but now I see that there's a simpler more abridged way of accessing it I guess I'll just burn my copy.&&Oh man I can't wait for Shannon to deliver Beatty's monologue 

>“If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change.”

My absolute favorite part of the book. There's a lot more to the monologue but that's the best bit. If you haven't read the book, go do so! It's terrifying how many similarities there are between their society and ours.&&Awesome!

I think the original book is going to need some generous re-interpretation to fly with today's audiences (as opposed to audiences from the 50s). I mean, a story centered around the downfall of society resulting from capitulation to the offended and the rise of new media? That's not exactly en vogue. 

I'm guessing this will kind of bend the source material until it's about an authoritarian government suppressing ideas.&&Just finding out about this. I wouldn't think the book would translate to screen very well at all, But It is HBO.&&I hope this movie surprises people and maintains it's original message. Many today think it is about right wing censorship, when in fact it's more about modern left wing censorship, censorship to avoid offense rather than social/religious censorship.

I'm a liberal, but after Handmaid's tale I think it's important to show extremism on both sides is dangerous.&&I hope this show actually focuses on the book's real message, about a overly sensitive populous wanting to censor media, compared with the most likely route.....totalitarian right wing government just being assholes.&&I'm still on the fence about Michael B.

Edit: Link to the production.&&I believe it's actually just a HBO film. Still should be cool though.&&It's strange because the book was mainly about an apathetic populous kept pacified and entertained by giant TV's.  Arguably HBO is a purveyor of exactly what Bradbury was warning us about.

(It wasn't about censorship, that was just a side effect.  The public demanded censorship so they would be protected from uncomfortable thoughts and live in their nice cocoons.)&&Bailey's vision already made it to film. In case you missed it, it was called Demolition Man. And what a vision it was. &&The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu was successful enough for a second season.

&&I think Bradbury's take is topical if done true to the book because, unlike Orwell's 1984, society willingly rejected intellect in favor of passive entertainment.

The take in the EQUILIBRIUM movie seems to be not that people willingly gave it up, but similar to Atwood's HANDMAID'S TALE, in that an incident was exploited to declare martial law... the government was then overthrown by the radicals.

Both takes are equally relevant right now but the more likely scenario is one of civic ignorance, as Justice Souter had warned in this [chillingly prescient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXa0L9ofFbM&t=21s) talk.&&Of all the books, I think Huxley had it the most correct. 1984 was censorship. Brave New World is mostly people didn't care and they were bred not to care. Equilibrium still focused more on censorship. Fahrenheit 451 is closer to Brave New World in that the society generally didn't care but they had a choice to care. BNW didn't allow for this choice. That's the scary part - the critical piece is not biologically part of your nature.&&> Equilibrium

This was pretty much a dystopia novel mash up, not a Fahrenheit 451 flick.&&Equilibrium isn't a Fahrenheit 451 adaptation, though?&&The drug based dystopia in Equilibrium is probably closer to the less well known swedish book Kallocain from 1940.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallocain

Seen through the eyes of idealistic scientist Leo Kall, Kallocain is a depiction of a totalitarian world state. An important aspect of the novel is the relationships and connections between the various characters, such as the marriage of the main character and his wife Linda Kall, and the feelings of jealousy and suspicion that may arise in a society with heavy surveillance and legal uncertainty.

One of its central ideas coincides with contemporary rumors of truth drugs that ensured the subordination of every citizen to the state. Both Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and Boye's Kallocain are drug dystopias, or societies in which pharmacology is used to suppress opposition to authority. However, unlike Brave New World, where a drug is used to suppress the urge to nonconformity generally, in Kallocain a drug is used to detect individual acts and thoughts of rebellion.&&Equilibrium?

I didn't.  From his outburst in front of the wives, to his interactions with Faber and his murder of Beatty... he was pretty impulsive.  Especially after he started opposing the idea of Fireman and the institution itself.

IMO he was an intelligent but volatile character.  Even in their discussions and arguments Beatty is ice cold and composed while Montag is sweating like a pig and can't think straight most of the time.&&Kinda surprised to see Jordan get back into acting, though I must say I'm thrilled, his performance in Space Jam was transcendent.&&[I concur.](http://i.imgur.com/5ke2YBc.gifv)&&I didn't really get this interpretation.

He plays a very subdued, contemplative man in rural Arkansas dealing with proverty, grief, and moving beyond the baggage of an abusive childhood. It's the complete opposite of the crazy eyes character he's known for.

Take Shelter is also amazing. He's a ""good guy"" but does break out into that crazy intensity throughout the story.

Anti-intellectualism has been growing in this country and it's been received with thunderous applause. &&There's also Huxley's take in Brave New World that seems to back up Bradbury, at least with the desire for shallowness (in 451 as the television walls and popularity of brochures). In Brave New World there's shallowness (discussing how pneumatic women are, displays of violence for arousal) and easy escapes (sexual or by using soma). Indoctrination by sleep seems to be replaced by dog whistles and deliberate  phrasing in the media. &&I don't know if I'm the one getting 1984 wrong, but isn't 1984 scary because people were able to think whatever they want? The torture scene where Winston is convinced 2 + 2 = 5 is the point isn't it? You have him in a jail cell with people who are happy to be tortured because their children said they were saying ""down with big brother"", and then you watch Winston go through the process of being convinced he's insane when we know he's the one who understand the reality.

Like, the censorship is just a supporting part to the rest of the story. Sure it sucks that Winston has zero proof that the Party framed the three original politicians. But the really scary thing is that by the end of the book he accepts that he invented it. 

Plus you have the whole ""we were always at war with east asia"" stuff. Which is people literally being unable to even process the reality in front of them. They can't even understand what it means to be lied to. They accept that THEY were wrong, or worse yet that REALITY was wrong.&&I read Fahrenheit differently...my impression was that Huxley saw people as dangerously lazy, being statisfied with shallow entertainment and in Fahrenheit 451 this allowed (in the past) the /some goverment to feed into that behavior and rid the people of any agency, ignorant of reality - essentially reaching a society which is very similiar to BNW when it comes to social and political awareness without the classism of BNW (although I assume there is some political class which is aware of the situation in Fahrenheit), the difference being that Fahrenheit is a society much closer to ours and not a Henry Ford worshipping class society of clones.&&Not with that attitude it's not. &&It's the first thing I thought of when I saw the movie.&&Thank you, I was questioning my entire remembrance of Equilibrium and Farenheit after I read that post.

The actions that were powerful and intriguing are the actions you just listed as having established the characters persona. Those actions aren't there to establish his persona.

Now think about schools editing ""Huckleberry Finn"" to remove the word 'nigger,' or the before-mentioned Harry Potter hysteria about witchcraft. The initial seeds of Fahrenheit 451 exist in society all around us, in the religious moralizing of the right and the social justice piousness from the left, or interest groups like the NRA or environmental groups. 

Imagine, for example, an extremist social justice presidency which bans any books without 50/50 gender representation. Is that much different from a Pence presidency which bans any book which shows adultery? Or an NRA presidency, which bans any book which shows guns as anything but heroic tools? Or an environmentalist presidency, which bans any book which advocates consumerism?&&He didn't say it was about right wing censorship.

It's very stylized and as such worth watching but...

There's a lot about it that doesn't make sense.  If people gave up reading, why make reading such a criminal offense?   

How could people start reading books if they no longer read anything (with words)?   

How can you use numbers to reference things not represented by numbers?   For example, if letters/words aren't used at all and a person is known as 384-286, how does that get pronounced as ""John Smith"" or whatever?

The fire chief at one point goes through book by book giving mini-reviews on how terrible they are, but why would he have any content specific opinion on any of them?

The various groups in society, the Alpha's Delta's and such, are designed and reared to live to a certain life style. It works to the extent where despite having a 'worse set' in life, the Delta could and would never seek to better it's lot. In fact, it believed that to be an Alpha would be worse than them being a delta. 

Brave New World strikes me more as a tale of society where real choice is bred out of most of the population, rather than a fault with an overly shallow and frivolous society; The society is only shallow to those outside it.

It's not 'hurr durr colleges are evil', it's that any conservative voices got bullied out of the places a decade ago and now they're basically echo chambers. The fucking guy who caved in that dude's head with a bike lock was a god damn *professor*.

Colleges are supposed to be about the free exchange of ideas, but ideologically, there is only one idea ""permitted"" there anymore. Why shouldn't conservative voices express disdain when you have kids with zero life experience effectively marching out with a diploma in one hand and ""list of shit I now believe"" in the other, and that list is just a bunch of dumb talking points? We already bemoan the fact that critical thinking skills aren't taught in school anymore - you think colleges are any different?

I thought the direction, cinematography, set+costume design, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUOJ8IlbdBQ) and most importantly acting were all great.

I have a negative opinion of it overall (and dropped it) because the characters are two-dimensional, first-person narration is lazy writing, and (most of all) I find the entire premise, setting and everything people do within it completely nonsensical.

What value do the women in Yvonne Strahovski's character's position bring to the whole situation? Surely in a pure patriarchy they would be useless and the fertile women would simply be taken as mates? If they're trying to produce children, why don't they fuck more frequently? Has this world just forgotten every bit of fertility science there is? Why is the mental and physical health of the fertile women not paramount? If they have a high suicide rate then this whole breeding program is totally fucked.

I point this out because it seems that people elsewhere in these comments are circlejerking about the show as if they only reason to dislike it is some disposition towards a supposed ""agenda"", which I didn't feel was the point of the show at all (I thought it was supposed to be analogous to the revolution in Iran, so if it had any message it's an anti-religious one).&&[deleted]&&Ah yes, the radical feminist agenda of not wanting to be raped&&>anyone who says it is subversively pushing some sort of radical feminist agenda

I honestly think Reddit has a genuine hate for feminists and SJWs that does not go beyond their own inability to put themselves in position or mindset of other people. I think most people here have a lack of empathy for anyone outside of their social groups.
&&> Reddit hates it because its main characters are women? Shocking.

I don't like that Bradbury got so angry at those who thought the message was different, since once you put something out in the world you sacrifice that control.

However, to me the whole ""it's about government censorship"" interpretation is a bit shallow if not wrong. In the book, it's even mentioned there was no government action against books at first; people just stopped reading.

It has a lot of takeaways, but the main one in my opinion is that consuming short summaries of information instead of the whole source can negatively impact society, and reduces appreciation for certain arts.

Just my two cents&&The theme according to the recent Reddit thread is to not watch as much tv and consume entertainment that doesn't challenge you. When I read the book in 7th grade I saw it as a call not to conform to society like every other dystopian novel. &&the author was pissed that censorship was the thing people got from it and not choosing passive entertainment and subjecting oneself to control.

ergo the point is the society we see now of bread and circuses will doom us all&&I think I read somewhere they thought when one reads a book , they gain more knowledge than everyone else who didn't read the book which causes inequality.  So by making books illegal,  nobody gets an ""unfair advantage"". &&Tl;Dr the ""opressive majority"" of CITIZENS (not the gubment directly) demand not only the banning but the destruction of anything they find offensive, to the point that basically everything is banned.

Moral of the story is don't pander to the vocal groups that are just looking for shit to get offended at.... else it spirals out of control and society looses a shitload of freedom by their own doing.   &&Man, it's been awhile, but I think that the basic ideas are that books and the existence and sharing of opinion and ideas are eventually considered to be too dangerous for society and against the overall trend towards consuming more and more media that was essentially ""empty calories"". People became lost in entertainment, which was reinforced and enabled by increasingly immersive technology.  

It made me think, just now, of the T.S. Elliot quote:  

Where is the Life we have lost in living?  
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?  
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?  


We live in an age of unparalleled access to information and the ability to aggregate, analyze and communicate it to others. We can talk to almost anyone in the world instantly, and for free. Yet it seems like we're outsourcing our thinking to politicians, celebrities, comedians, and whoever else tells us what we want to hear, is funniest, or whatever. &&> Because most people I see who talk about its message actually have it completely wrong according the the author.

Frankly it doesn't matter that author thinks people who see themes of censorship are wrong. Once written, books (specifically the meaning of them) belong to the readers. There are clear themes of censorship in that book regardless of the author's intent.&&I agree, does not sound like something I could sell on a story board even though it turned out pretty great.&&I really enjoyed Seth Rogan's drug binge, the scene in the church had me rolling.&&Was thinking more 90s Judge Dredd&&It's back.

We just drank beer and smoked weed together. To be fair I went to a pretty small school so that's prob why it wasn't so insane.

It's been a long time since I read this book, so I could be off a bit.&&This guy reads his Barthes.&&That was my understanding of the book too.

We had very little drama within or between organizations.  We also did a lot of fundraising and help to the community.  I found greek life to be very rewarding and my closest best friends were in my fraternity with me.  Some of the larger universities definitely abuse the point of them, but I blame Hollywood for a lot of that.  My feeling is that you get what you put into it, and some just want to attend the keg gers and sleep through the community stuff.  That's fine.

I hear a shit ton of stories about stupid shit frats do at other schools, but my school's Greek system (which I'm a member of) really doesn't do stupid shit or fuck around or promote being older teenagers. 

Honestly, the worst thing that happened last year was a campus wide snowball fight (school of <1000 students) between all the houses and someone thought it'd never funny to freeze them and break some windows. Their house and the school dealt with it quickly, he apologized, and all is fine in our system. I think it's less the fault of the fraternity/sorority system, and more the mindset of the people joining and the atmosphere that is promoted by the school and media around them.

Will Ferrell says the only film of his that he would possibly do a sequel to is 'Step Brothers'.,33099,6ks2wk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7U3K44Ejns,1524,1498979929.0,,"They both marry women with children and live next door to each other:

All the characters in Step Brothers had a nice conclusive arc, there's no reason to do another one.&&Old school >&&Did you actually watch the video you linked? Nowhere does he say he would only do a sequel to Step Brothers. He was asked if there were any films he would love to revisit and he mentioned that they had discussed Step Brothers. Hardly adamant that he would never possibly do a sequel to something else.&&A night at the roxbury 2&&[deleted]&&Wait...I literally just saw the other day at Despicable Me 3 he has a sequel to Daddy's Home coming out?&&I want a sequel to his Matrix parody with Justin Timberlake and Stiffler from American Pie&&Step Brothers 2: Rise of Prestige Worldwide (wide wide wide)

The success of PWwww was inevitable.  The company has become so successful that they are going public.  Dale has let the success go to his head and has become a social media co-CEO.  He tweets the craziest comments at all hours of the day making people wonder why he tweets out at 3 AM.  Brennan runs the company and is revered by all 400 PWwww employees.  He gives motivational speeches on eating white dog shit and the value of peace offerings.

Nancy and Doback have used modern medicine to become pregnant and they have a baby at the beginning of the movie.  The child becomes the true link to Dale and Brennan...a link by blood.

Dale and Brennan cherish their new sibling (I think it should be a girl but I'm really not putting much thought into it right now) and they become the best brother parents when Nancy falls ill from the birth of the baby.  (Nancy is fine, it's just a plot excuse to get the baby into the hands of the guys).

B&D's whole world becomes the baby. They feed her, bathe her, change her, read to her, comfort her, put her to bed, all the good things that parents do.  And with this comes the stress of life as most new parents feel.

How can they meet the demands of the company and their shareholders while caring to the needs of their sister?  

(I think it could be a good story about how Americans work too much and how corporations don't value the time spent with a newborn.  There's a lot of built in conflict here so there could be a lot of cross-over from parenting to being the bosses of the biggest and best entertainment company in the world. I can see Dale carrying the baby in a baby wrap, forcing Nancy to pump milk so they can feed the baby, and feeling neglected by Brennan who is a great parent but also carries the responsibility of PWwww.)

Thank God they won't be making an Elf 2. Everyone loves that movie, and thinks I'm crazy when I say I absolutely hate it.

EMILIOOOOOOO!!!!&&I wish he would make a sequel to Talladega Nights. Maybe something like ""The Chase of Texas Ranger"" where  Grayson Russell is breaking into racing&&Uh....anchorman ?&&I would like to see a follow up to ""The other guys"".

Ricky Bobby has done so well in NASCAR that he has a Days of Thunder realization and goes into F1.  But can he go head to head with the worlds finest? Especially his new found rival, the 2 time champion German driver named Lennart Hahn (played by Christoph Waltz)?

Edit:  Ok... let us continue.  One problem in the film is that Ricky has no idea how to drive an F1 car, let alone the rules,  after almost crashing and running around like he's in flames, again, the team he is part of desires to hire someone who can train him.  In comes ex-rival yet new found friend Jean Girard (played by Sacha Baron Cohen)  fresh of the divorce of his dog training husband.  Yet a love triangle persist between Jean and Lennart unknowingly.  When Lennart finds out that Girard might steal his man, he runs him over with a slow golf cart.  Ricky finds Jean lightly injured with a sprained ankle, yet acts dramatic.  (A Saving Private Ryan like scene commences with Girard in Ricky's hands pretending he is dying).  Ricky vows to get revenge, and tries to beat up Lennart, but he is ruffed up by Lennart's team members  Geoffrey Bumnapper (played by Tom Hardy) and Frederick Shaggington (played by Idris Elba) Ricky then has a strong rivalry as they go race by race, with almost running over his pit crew, racing and crashing the pace car, etc etc.  While his team boss (insert REAL F1 driver for cameo) doubts him heavily.  *I don't know how to continue this, anyone got any ideas?*&&Why not do **The Other Guys 2**?

Rated PG 13&&I didn't know that the AWESOM-O robot had a reddit account. I see its still pitching movie ideas featuring Adam Sandler&&Teenage son and daughters for everyone. The sons both have the same first name. Like, Steven and Stephen, Brian and Bryan, or Mark and Marc. 

But the teenage daughter of one starts dating the teenage son of the other, and people keep misunderstanding that nubile daughter is with brother, while saying that nubile daughter is with step-brother. 

In the end it's the other brother and the other step-sister that are really in a relationship and they reveal a pregnancy at some inappropriate occasion. &&You had me at Adam Sandler.&&This is actually extremely good. Except for the part with Adam Sandler. I'd watch the shit out of that movie. Again, only sans Sandler.&&why is there such a distaste for Sandler? movies are stupid as fuck alot..sure..but still..can watch them on any given rainy day and be content &&I'd watch the fuck outta that.&&*All* the kids&&First time I read this I assumed the brothers took the kids and started dating each other. Then I was kind of fascinated, yet terrified, about how far the improve would go. &&This is the best Will Ferral plot ever. &&Um. They already are planning a sequel. They've acquired permits to film it in Concord, NH.

Holy Shit that really got me thanks m8&&Will Farrell has been in surprisingly few sequels, especially given the success of his films and the fact that they are comedies.

* Daddy's Home

* Zoolander (Not a lead role)

* Anchorman

*  Austin Powers (Not a lead role)&&i like the title, but i am apprehensive about the focus this plot would place on the children.&&""***PAH!***""&&Holy crap that last line was good&&Absolutely awful haha. &&...were you a writer for the first one? That's really spot-on. &&That strikes me as more of a Meet the Fockers reboot&&Wait they're making a sequel to daddy's home? Although that ending with John Cena was pretty funny.&&Austin Powers? &&He ment ones written /produced by him. He did not write and/or produce those films.&&Isn't he currently working on Daddy's Home 2?&&Isn't Anchorman 2 exactly like the first one? Don't know what people were expecting, you people got what you wanted. A dumb, stale early 2000's comedy&&Anchorman 2 was good &&We need a montage of him learning to turn right.&&I'd give my left nut for this&&Meanwhile, in the same movie, Cal Noughton becomes a spy.&&.&&Fuck this is so good. &&The Other Guys is a tragic story. One of the funniest movies of the decade, but the massive budget meant the box office couldn't justify a sequel, and we had to settle for a watered down version of the Ferrell-Wahlberg pairing.&&The Other Guys is maybe my favorite Will Ferrell movie tbh. So well written, solid line after solid line, hilarious. Killing off The Rock and Samuel L Jackson like two minutes in is so great.&&I think the silent fight during the funeral is one of my favorite scenes in that movie. Such a great bit.&&Michael Keaton's stock is a lot higher now than it was then. I can only hope he just loved making the first one so much that he uses some of his renewed Hollywood stroke to push a sequel getting made. He was actually my favorite part of the original.&&I've been holding my breath for an other guys 2 since the second I walked out of the theater of the first&&>""Gator needs his gat, punk ass bitch!""&&The lion discussion was probably the best line in the movie.&&How about Talladega nights: the fall of Ricky Bobby. ""Imma come at you like a spider monkey, again!"" Or ""if you ain't first, your last, but maybe second."" Or don't snort these rice crispies""&&No doubt. I still think the TLC gag was one of the best parts of the movie. I need to know how it happened. Had to have been an improv thing that they just worked with. &&Just ganking the shit I ganked.... What's the world come to&&The clown has no penis.. &&That part in the movie [Old School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pFfiB21nRY) where he takes a tranquilizer dart to the jugular always had me in stitches. &&Step Brothers and Anchorman are two of my all time favorites.&&I can't decide between that and the elf. &&There was literally a thousand shitty ways they could have done a sequel and yet they picked the one perfect way that would make me want to go see it.&&They had me at Mel Gibson, but then just sealed the deal with John Lithgow.&&the trailer ran before Baby Driver and at first I rolled my eyes like ""Not this shit again."" Then Mel Gibson showed up and I was like ""Hmm, that's inspired casting at least."" And then John Lithgow showed up and I was suddenly like ""Wow, I may actually watch this movie.""&&Saw the trailer for the first time before Transformers the other day, and I laughed my ass off. Looks hilarious.&&I took my mom to see it, not expecting it to be as hilarious as it was. It's the reason I ended up watching The Other Guys (loved that too). 

Walberg shouldn't do movies without Ferrell &&Same here. The original wasn't great, but it gets super 'will ferrell absurd' towards the end, which I really liked. &&This so much! I'm a huge Daddy's Home guy.&&And Zoolander&&I like Anchorman 2&&**You get back here and you make love to my wife**&&Shaved.&&ARE YOU STUPID OR JUST DEAF&&the funniest part is that when she greets Terry at the door, she gets *his* name wrong and calls him Telly&&Theres a lot of great comediens to play other buddy cops like The Rock/Samuel L Jackson did. I think the Franco brothers in aviators could do the role well, or maybe Dane Cook and Ryan Reynolds would make an interesting cop partners to play the douchey cops &&I never thought I needed this until now... &&Wonder if he and Johnny Hopkins ever got backed together and smoked weed&&""It was me, Johnny Hopkins and Sloan Kettering and we used to blaze that shit up all day."" &&Snap!&&Dad, I'm doing this because I love you.

""Fuck you""&&Are you saying 'Pow'? What are you saying?&&You've actually seen him eat another man's penis? &&When that first trailer hit I was pumped. I avoided all the rest of the trailers. I then started (uncontrollably) thinking how the movie would play out. I had some great ideas and then went to the movie was the only one in the theater (not a good sign but I do enjoy being the only one there). 

After the movie finished I was a bit pissed off. I came up with a better story then what they threw together. The story with the fat kid was just stupid. &&Zoolander 2 was so bad, i should have walked out of the film. it was literally a waste of time for me to watch it. i'm getting angry even thinking about it.&&probably meant more that the main character in that is ben stiller not will ferrel.&&No, I mean to the extent that it wasn't strictly a Will Ferrell film, it's a Ben Stiller film.&&It definitely had its moments, but overall it was significantly less funny. It just didn't have the same heart, and a lot of the jokes were ""cheap"" in my opinion. &&I think it would be better to just take the brothers away from that situation so it's not just a rehash of the first film.  
  
Put them both on a road trip, send them to college, give them jobs, anything other than just ""let's bring back the band and redo the first film!""&&Yes but that sounds awful.&&> Sequels have been made with less imagination than what I just wrote.

Im fairly sure Speed 2: Cruise Control was made entirely because of the name.&&Then thats just the first film again&&Too many younglings on this subreddit. Old school is a classic &&Come on, bring your green hat! &&its never too late. 

The world needs mitchapalooza II&&He's currently forwarding this thread to the movie studio now.

""33 upvotes for Roxbury 2! The people demand it! P- please give me this. Monkeybone 2 never happened, this is all I got!""&&According to Google he's been in a lot recently. Mostly side roles. &&He does stand-up at second-tier casinos &&[deleted]&&I thought they already fucked with it with an animated Christmas special, starring no one from the movie.&&I also liked ""3 large children go back to college""&&Let's be honest, it applies to most of Ferrell's films.&&Not really. His characters are often parodies of real idiots, but rarely man-children. Ron Burgundy was a misogynist, Ricky Bobby was an egocentric, the guy in Kicking & Screaming was overly competitive, etc. etc.

The only other man-child he's played was in Elf, but he didn't write that one, so it's hard to refer to it as *his* movie.&&SHAKE N' BAKE!&&10 years ago, 1 comment.

What the flying fuck.&&>  Rated PG 13

I can't not read this in that damn goofy voice.&&RAYTED PEE-GEE THIRTEEEN&&Every movie needs a relatable carrot.&&Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.....or something.&&[deleted]&&That was the last thing he said...&&Adam Sandler acting as all the kids is the best part IMO&&Because he really started phoning it in post Nicky/Anger Management. &&I actually didn't mind Jack and Jill. Far from the best movie ever made, but it was worth watching to see Al Pacino go crazy. &&It's because fans of his earlier films feel betrayed by his later tendancy to do family friendly films, designed to reach as wide an audience as possible,  making him mega bucks at the box office. Then when he went back to films for adults, they sucked. I didn't mind Funny People, but that was more a Judd Apatow film. Hipsters have nothing to do with it.&&i blame the hipsters&&Idk I haven't watched a whole lot of his newer and yes you can look at his movies and know the entire plot from the name and art, that being said when I put on an Adam Sandler movie I don't expect cinematographic masterpiece I expected some low effort plot line with some mildly funny jokes one or two rib crackers and a happy ending, he's rare to disappoint. &&>Daddy's Home

I've never heard of that one, unless it's the one where he's Bill Cosby and a ghost and the movie is called Ghost Dad... but I feel like that's probably not right. &&Wow, I can't believe I forgot he was in Austin Powers.&&Are you saying ""POW?""&&Yeah, it's about Ferrell and Wahlberg meeting the others father. John Lithgow plays Ferrell's dad and Mel Gibson plays Wahlberg's. &&He reprises his role as the henchman Mustafa, but he probably has less than 5 minutes screentime in the two films combined.&&He wrote and produced both Anchorman movies.&&I thought the first wasn't a complete piece of crap. It was an alright PG/PG-13 comedy where Ferrell and Wahlberg play well of of each other. Pretty forgettable though, which is why I was confused as to why they were making a second.&&It's actually surprisingly already shot and coming out around Christmas. The trailer is on YouTube. &&I hope these downvotes teach you to have better opinions! /s&&Ehhh&&Most of the gags people have suggested have been awful, but that's really clever.

I never saw The Other Guys because I thought it would suck and I avoided it for years. I finally broke down one day because I had just moved- no tv, no internet, no friends, no nothing; so I popped in a dvd of the Other Guys that somehow found its way into my half dozen of movies and I watched it out of desperation. Turns out its one of the funniest fucking movies ever with a damn hilarious cast. They even filmed a scene down the street from my house, its so surreal seeing a place you spent years in suddenly on film. I was always secretly waiting for a second one. &&Thanks for the fuck shack- dirty mike and the boys &&Call it the Other Other Guys&&Daddy's home?  I felt it was a cheap knock off of The Other Guys and I looked forward to it.&&They just jumped 50 stories. Wasn't even an awning.&&""You thinking why I'm thinking?""

I even named my car Shiela because of this movie...I can't just say bye to her once.&&[deleted]&&No body mentions Michael Keaton, but his character is fucking hilarious too. &&Aim for the bushes.&&I feel like I need to watch The Other Guys again lol&&""I'm the winner, we all saw it!""&&Are you quoting TLC?

 You got a f*** dart in your neck! 

You, you're crrrazy. I like you. But, you're crazy. &&You're crazy man. I love you but you're crazy&&Step Brothers and The Other Guys. &&It's just Elf&&Same here!  

I hated the first one but this one looks a lot better.

And Baby Driver was great!&&[For the lazy](https://youtu.be/2MddEE_tC_w)&&I just watched the first one last night for the first time.  Had a few beers while watching it and thought it was pretty enjoyable.

I think Cena was a great choice for next level Whalberg.  He's one of the few guys that I can think of who could make Whalbergs character step down to Ferrels character level.

Edit:. Just watched the trailer and no sign of Cena even though he is rumored to play a prominent role.  Looks like they are concentrating on the older fathers.  Still, it looks even better than the first one with that cast.&& So how bad was the new transformers and do you still hear that transforming noise ringing in the back of your ears? Also I'm guessing you have kids that wanted to go? &&This post kinda says it all &&Speaking about transformers. I saw that 3 days ago.

Plus the Rock's value and popularity has only grown since then. The movie pitches itself.&&THIS HOUSE IS A FUCKING PRISON&&Still hate you &&**PA PA**&&Like Kobayashi!&&It was in international waters so they couldn't prosecute him, but I saw it. &&Have you seen the R rated version? It's the extended edition, I'm not sure what it's actually called.

Parents, who start to supervise as investors, ask them to hire Derrick. Ruins dynamic of company, crazy antics, etc.

Also Key & Peele join cast as their rivals, promoting ""Black Entertainment Matters"".

Wife and I saw it, and it was easily the worst movie we've seen all year. AC wasn't on at home and it was 106 so we decided to go to the movies. Had already seen everything else so figured fuck it. Apparently, that's the same thought the writers had. &&I'm no movie expert or anything, but here's my review coming from someone who normally loves those kind of movies.

The writing was awful like most people have been saying. It sucks when you have actors that you know are good actors but the writing is so bad it almost makes the actors seem bad too. Less product placement than the last one so I'll give it that. Lots of unnecessary cringy characters. Plot was kinda generic like what's to be expected from these kind of movies tbh so that didn't really bug me, it was just the execution. Token hot chick like always. A surprising amount of top tier actors did voices for the transformers which was kinda cool. But the biggest thing that honestly threw me off that I haven't seen anyone else mention, is that every time the damn shots changed the movie went from fullscreen to widescreen! It was so obnoxious. Overall 4/10, had a few badass action movie moments but not much. And to answer your other questions, I wasn't hearing it until you mentioned it and also like another comment mentioned, I and nothing to do so me and the wife went for the hell of it.&&I forgot that he was in The Departed. It is a great film. I havent seen The Fighter. 

Imagine though, Alec Baldwins character being played by Ferrell instead &&Is that wing? It's all tendon. &&BEEOOBEEOO&&He should be the villain in every movie.&&My friend and I have a dream to write a movie with Danny McBride playing Hitler after the war. The premise is Hitler faked his death and gets into a bunch of zany hijinks with a bunch of other members of the third reich. &&in the galaxy of this sucks camel dicks&&Key & Peele as the antagonists would make perfect sense from a marketing point of view as they don't really have the same kind of humour, I definitely want to see that now.&&yes i would definitely watch this. but, i don't know...for some reason i feel like sinbad should be involved in the plot&&The idea of a scene where one of the brothers retorts with ""Well....I think ALL Entertainment Matters.""

"Sigourney Weaver looks back on Ripley and explains why she loves sci-fi: the genre tackles important moral issues and pushes progress, both in science and society",31583,6p1ooc,https://www.inverse.com/article/34557-sigourney-weaver-defenders-alexandria-marvel-netflix-trump,1356,1500821610.0,,"Sigourney Weaver has done more than her fair share to make Sci Fi a respected genre.  I will shamelessly watch any movie she's in because I know she will genuinely pour her heart into it.  She brings depth and feeling to the most unexpected roles.

I especially like her as the villian in non-sci fi stuff.  I loved her villian in Cabin in the Woods.  And I'm thrilled she's going to be the primary villain in Defenders.&&Yet Sci Fi still cant get recognized with major awards. They dont even get a category so movies like The Martian get recognized as a god damn comedy. 

**edit: couln't let this gem of a reply by u/neotropic9 get buried:**

>It's no wonder The Martian took best comedy.
Damon's comedic timing was consistently on point. The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory.
One thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, “Astronaut Mark Watney... was killed.” Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, “this is mutiny.”
Stranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.)
It's no wonder The Martian picked up Best Comedy. If you're looking for a good joke, you can count on the Golden Globes.&&Sci Fi is definitely a medium where you have interesting topics explored under the guise of say Robot rights. You could apply those concepts to race relations for instance. I love Isaac Asimov's works&&Seeing her in that Blomkamp short made me realize how much I missed Ripley. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather take an on-the-nose social allegory Alien over another Ridley Scott directed Alien... Unfortunately, Covenant probably killed any chances of seeing either. Goddammit.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&She's in The Defenders, a Netflix series soon to start. &&[deleted]&&The main problem with covenant is that it followed the same formula  as alien and aliens but didn't perfect it. Both alien and aliens are marvels in film because of the way they are directed and the actor effort that they put it. I think that the actors in covenant put tons of effort in bit because it felt like alien again o feel like it didn't click&&I watched alien again a few weeks ago.  It holds up pretty well.  

There was a specific scene in Covenant that bothered me, where the science officer allowed an affected person on the ship and did not quarantine properly.  She also flipped out.  In Alien there is a similar scene, and Ripley calmly tells them they are not getting on the ship.  The android lets them on despite her orders.  It illustrates how you can find ways to do things smartly without just going for a cheap scare.&&I'd love to see more smart, hard sci-fi like ""Her"" and Gattaca instead of Star Wars things.  Weaver would be fantastic in that kind of film.

I could see her as, like, Huw's mother in Rapture of the Nerds or something like that.

Or for Fantasy, if you were okay with using Americans for Discworld she'd be a wonderful Granny Weatherwax.  Or do the Patrician as a woman (Matrician?).&&She kicked ass in that new Oats Studio short....I hope they do another one of those&&And the new alien film scripts are reason for a public execution. They are blatantly stupid writing.

Lets walk outside it looks pretty on this alien biological world.

Really? This is remedial basic braindead level knowledge. You simply do not swim in acid nor do you walk outside on a freaking alien planet without protection no matter the bloody weather.

When I saw the film I saw a blatant disregard for the brightness of at least half the audience.

We are not as DUMB as YOU.&&The original female action hero. What a babe. She's right, sci-fi is what cultivates the creators of tomorrow. I've heard a lot of NASA engineers took huge inspiration from Star Trek and 2001. &&You can bet that if Sigourney Weaver is playing a character, she's going to kill it. &&Wasn't she the voice in finding dory&&Ripley was my childhood hero. Chick was fierce.&&I love Ripley because as a young girl she represented strength, feminaty, loyalty, intelligence, and on top of that she wasn't hugely buff, but what a badass. She seriously deserves some recognition for that.  And I as an adult wore my Ripley costume from Alien.  It was an honor &&Yeah, the point of sci-fi is to be social commentary.  If your space opera isn't a vehicle to discuss politics or social issues, it's a fantasy in space.  It's why Star Trek is sci-fi, and Star Wars is fantasy.

That said, were the Alien films really ever about anything?  Alien is a horror movie.&&For my money Ripley is one of the great feminist characters. She has full agency of her actions, she earns the respect of the crew with her what she does (not says), she shows depth of character and compassion but also has enormous strength. Great character, a great example of the perfect person for the role too.&&She's one of my favorite actors, I love her so much.&&*I felt just like Sigourny Weaver*
  
*When she had to kill those aliens*
  
-John Grant&&I love her, and I love Ripley so damn much. I don't care that she is a fictional character, she's always been my biggest role model. Whenever I feel weak I think ""WWRD"". She wouldn't take no shit, that's what. It's a reminder that women can be strong and fuck all that other noise. &&Until Alien: Covenant where the actor who plays Kenny Powers introduces: ""Sweet Tits"" into the lore, undoing some of the work Ripley helped establish as a strong female character.&&Im 23 and still attracted to Sigourney Weaver.&&Definitely one of the best things about sci fi and fantasy.&&Movie award ceremonies are so rigged...&&Actually. Jones was the star of Alien&&To anyone wanting to see more sci-fi Sigourney: check out Oats Studio. They just released a bunch of awesome short films for free and she's in one of them [(Rakka)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjQ2t_yNHQs). I really wish it was a full movie.&&She isn't wrong.  It is why Star Trek will always be more influential/important than Star Wars.

It also wouldn't surprise me that people who watch SciFi are generally more open minded.&&I wanted to be her as a child. I always enjoy her movies.&&Just got done watching Alien for the idk time. Love this woman!!!&&If she's going to start doing these big budget Sci-fi series, I'd love to see her as a Starfleet Captain!&&I get what she's saying, but Alien didn't really tackle any ""issues', it was pure experience. You could argue it indirectly was progressive since it showed a powerful female character, but that was not the aim of the story. &&Don't forget Galaxy Quest!&&damn right, we need more solid sci fi movies&&One of the greatest examples in cinema of a character that was written well without their gender having anything to do with it.&&Or they were just entertainment &&Ehh&&And leading the charge is the Star Trek Franchise!  Oh, right.  Abrams happened.&&This lady was always a hero to me.. Because of the aliens movie, I got into science and have a love for astronomy.. We need more inspiring women like her.. It's okay to like pink nail polish and have a penchant for science.. I hope more women can be influenced to take on more science and engineering jobs. &&Its funny Hollywood thinks they can make an empowering roll for women by just having the star of the action movie be female. Hunger Games, the new Star Wars, Ghostbusters, but in reality they were all very forgettable. You want an empowering female character? Just look at Ripley in the alien movies. Such an awesome character, and they didnt need to give her super powers (well except in Resurrection but I liked her the least in that film.) I think we need more female actors who arent just a pretty face.&&Whoever's writing modern female leads in Sci-Fi should go back and watch Ripley. 

They had the prototype in Alien and Aliens but decided to copy the crappy half alien version with superpowers from Resurrection instead. &&And that's why Weaver is an actress, not a philosopher/politician/scientist&&/r/gatekeeping      
      
Are you the KeyMaster?&&If you watch Alien she is probably one of the strongest characters in cinema, never mind female figure.

Alien franchise is full of strong female leads.

&&Rod Serling turned to sci-fi because he'd get censored when he wrote about serious or controversial issues, but network executives didn't care or didn't understand when he substituted a space alien for a member of an ethnic group.&&Also, it confuses jocks and scares away chicks...wait...&&What's surprising to me is how many people I've seen raging lately about sci-fi doing this as if they've never seen the genre before. Like all the people getting upset about the new Doctor Who being a woman complaining that the show has been taken over by ""social justice warriors"". And I'm just like, you've seen sci-fi before right? This is what it does. Kirk and Uhura had the first interracial kiss. Starbuck was recast as a woman and was amazing. Silent Running was one of the best environmentalism films of all time. Blade Runner dealt with what it means to be human.

This is what sci-fi does. It tackles the social issues. If you're not on board with that, probably should check out a different genre.&&What's interesting to me about science fiction is the more the years go by, the more it seems like a lot of those plots could come to fruition. 

Very dangerous societies walled off or otherwise isolated. Various groups of violent people who share the same think being shunned/removed and again, isolated away. Income gaps widening. People picking awful career choices through equally awful guidance and the world having a host of people with useless degrees/no real skills. Technology making a lot of lower-end jobs disappear..creating more  govt assistance, and of course, crime. Resource issues. 

The more sci fi I read the more I wonder ""when we get to this point"" not ""if"" &&Oh boy. Sucks to learn just how evil this woman is at heart after a lifetime of enjoying her performances. Didn't know she was such a misandrist.&&http://i.imgur.com/o3jKSe9.jpg&&> She plays the chief antagonist in the new Marvel team-up show, the rich and wicked Alexandra, and somewhat fittingly says she based the character on rich, conservative men she’s known in New York. Any New Yorker will recognize the tropes and trappings of this new and very dangerous socialite, from her love and support of classical music to a maniacal focus on success at any cost.

Why do people keep associating classical music with maniacs and psychopaths?&&I was watching Aliens a couple weeks ago , for the first time in years, and I just remember thinking how much I loved her as Ripley. She's still beautiful in my opinion as a 28 year old male , but I must've had a crush on her because there's something about her in that role. Her unique, soothing voice, and overall demeanor, it made me a fan of her for life. She's also just a great actress. 

I know a lot of people don't like Aliens compared to the first but looking back it's not as horrible as I once thought. 

Edit: didn't read the article I just wanted to say that. &&I'm sick of everything being an in-your-face social commentary. Alien did it right: No constant reminder that **RIPLEY IS A WOMAN**, no **THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US** messages.

It was a person, stuck in some real deep shit with a company that likes fucking with things it doesn't get.

Films recently have just been [SOCIAL COMMENTARY] after [SOCIAL COMMENTARY] after [USING A SPECIFIC ACTOR IN A SPECIFIC ROLE TO GAIN ATTENTION FROM THE PROGRESSIVE CROWD].

Shit, I always figured a great movie idea would be one about a group of soldiers in space, *always* clad in suits of full armour, and they never mention race or gender explicitly, and any time it is mentioned it's a character taking the piss and trying to confuse their squadmates by claiming to be a different nationality or race or gender every time. Suit filters would make their voices sound inherently robotic.

That way, if you make the character models distinct enough, you can have more focus on the plot, as opposed to reviewers whining that they didn't have a black woman in the movie. 

There might be a black woman. You can't see their faces or skin. Are you implying that they have to act in a certain way to definitely be a black woman? How very offensive.

God, I wish films were rated based on actual content as opposed to what skin colour or gender the main actor is.
&&Someone should remind the people who are making the new Star Trek of this little nugget, because they have failed spectacularly at making their films mean anything or even memorable.&&i love this woman&&""No shit."" - Every sci-fi fan ever.&&""First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.""&&She seems like such a cool down to earth intelligent person. I'd like to have a beer with.&&I really wish actors would stop pretending to be activists. &&Sigourney is a brilliant, classy, talented babe. I've had a crush on her since she went down the elevator with a flamethrower.&&Zero to Trump in 60 seconds. Why cant anyone stay on topic anymore. I love the characters Ripley and Shaw. And I love the directors habit of female hero/sole survivor. But why did it have to veer to politics so quickly?&&Why do people have to make everything about feminism? &&Her love of sci-fi didn't stop her from phoning it in for Paul. She was dreadful in that movie which is a shame because it wasn't even a bad movie.&&The narrative should be that Ripley is the shit, and Feminism shouldn't even play a role in it. Ripley was awesome because she was a strong, convincing character who could kick ass but also be motherly, was smart and decisive, and demonstrated compassion but had a no nonsense approach to getting things done. She had characteristics that are typically unique to one or the other gender, and that is why her appeal is universal.&&Oh yay a life long hollywood liberal villifying Trump supporters. Who woulda thunk it.&&*Reads title*

Horror is also criminally over looked.&&Because inevitably, a large part of storytelling is wasted on exposure and CGI.&&Sci fi isnt really a ""complete"" genre because you can make virtually any kind of movie without violating sci fi genre conventions.

It makes sense that it doesn't have its own category. The genre has more to do with the setting than the actual content of the movie.&&Award ceremonies are just glorified mass circle jerks.&&I think sci-fi is at its best when the message is at least somewhat obfuscated. Elysium, as an example, was *extremely* heavy-handed with its message about health care. Worse, it trivialized it -- it literally gave rich people magic health machines that were the size of a bed and worked instantly and they were held back from the masses anyway.

District 9, while obviously an apartheid movie, I think worked a lot better because it had the message about crossing boundaries and seeking similarities without seeming like an advertisement from a lobbying group.&&Was I supposed to replace ""robots"" with ""race relations"" as if I'm the only one around here who considers robots as people too thanks to Asimov's works?&&Even beyond that, alternate/future societies are ones that can explore the social taboo topics of the modern day.  From interracial couples on Star Trek to Polyamorous marriages in Caprica to Unisex facilities in Starship Troopers to Technologically Enhanced Humans in Black Mirror and so on and so forth. 

The medium allows for different societal standards in the fiction, which allows the creators and consumers to explore things that can't be explored in a realistic world.  Heck, you could even include South Park's ""Go God Go"" trilogy of episodes as an exploration of humanity's inherent tendency to self-segregate on ideology in such a way that even within an Atheist World there is dogmatic hatred of other groups.  &&I like it when Sci-fi movies have these deep and interesting topics that relate to real world issues, but at the same time I cant STAND when its shoved in your face. Example being Bladerunner, that had MANY amazing themes and topics such as overpopulation, pollution, power of corporations, but these were all side themes to the main theme of what does it mean to be human? (Lol thats at least what I think the main theme of the movie is). But then on the other hand you have movies like Elysium where they take one of the side themes of Bladerunner (Rich living on offworld colonies, poor living in poverty on polluted Earth) and made an entire movie about it and making a big preachy mess. Reminded me of Avatar a movie I really didnt enjoy very much as it was all about how destroying the environment is so evil and why cant we just live in harmony with the environment like the Avatar aliens do. Well maybe if we could ride flying bird things to our jobs we could. It was again over-preachy and felt very forced. Not to say I dont think issues like environmental destruction or wealth inequality are important but I think both Elysium and Avatar were WAY to extreme about the way they depicted these themes to the point where it made it unrelatable to current circumstances.&&Asimov was specifically trying to get away from two tropes of robots in SF:

* They take over humanity
* They're stand-ins for African Americans, Jews, etc.

This was back in the late 1940s. These things were already overused tropes at the time.&&We need that Foundation adaptation to happen soon. I feel like that would be good to get out into the spotlight in this day and age. It's super relevant right now.&&To me, scifi always was and currently still is the mouthpiece of intellectuals. While other genres sure have this as well, scifi combines arts, philosophy, sciences, history, politics, economics and culture/society - be it utopia or dystopia - to paint a vision ever so vivid, yet daunting.

I wish more people would dive into these worlds and discover not only scifi, but the concepts within which sure would help broaden their horizons. 

Scifi is like an ocean: a place full of mysteries and adventures, but also a mirror.&&The PC game Alien:Isolation is easily in the top 3 Alien movies, #1 for me.  Great story about Ripley's daughter Amanda, and her search for her mother after the Nostromo goes missing.  Scary as shit too, literally made me jump at times.

I think a lot of the best sci fi over the past decade or two has been in video games and not other media.&&Exactly. They let Ridley take control of the franchise and lead it in the wrong direction. We should be seeing Ripley on Earth by now, post-Resurrection, not the superfluous and nonsensical attempts and prequels. &&Do I have an unpopular opinion?  I liked Covenant, I mean, it wasn't knocking me on the floor but it was pretty good (I thought at least good enough to carry the series).&&Sequel to the latest alien movie is already happening and Ridley Scott confirmed in an interview that the engineers would return for the sequel.
&&My dream is that they let Nolan take a crack at an Alien movie when Ridley passes &&Am I dumb? I thought Covenant was awesome (if predictable).&&I really don't mind how heavy handed he is with his social commentary. It's just the way he never separates countries or peoples while doing it. District 9 is set in South Africa and is about Apartheid. Why not change the setting? Elysium is about illegal immigration. It literally shows Hispanic people escaping to Elysium in the opening sequence. 

Alien has always been about social commentary. The first one tackled rape and sexual assault very heavily to the point where the Xenomorph intentionally looks like a giant pecker. The second was a very heavy Vietnam allegory from the styling of the vehicles to the soldiers. 

I'm just tired of Ridley Scott. The man is only as strong as his writers, and it's obvious that he's very bitter about James Cameron doing better with something he started. The idea of Bloomkamp swinging in and making something better than his ""Engineer"" Saga (if we can call it that anymore) ate at him. We had a chance to get a grizzled old Hicks and our beloved Ripley back, but Scott had to put his foot down on it. I hope Alien goes away for a while now. It needs a break and needs someone new helming the ship. I hate to say it, but Michael Fassbender can only carry a series so far with such bad writing. &&Sadly Blompkamp said in his recent AMA that any chance of his Alien film with Weaver is pretty much dead &&I loved Covenant and thought it answered a lot of questions I had after Prometheus. &&Damn, I've been avoiding any real spoilers or reviews simply because I've been waiting for it to hit the dollar movies, but is it really that bad?? &&Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest got me pretty heated&&I recently found out about this pic https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/d5/b1/83d5b107c945ccaa1605ea9fa08ed167.jpg&&How's about Geena Davis?&&Yeah, me too.

No, in films the point of most science fiction is being a cool environment for a terror/action/adventure/comedy movie.

Alien is a slasher in space, there's no bigger than life theme going on there. 

Gattaca, Contact, District 9, A.I., Bicentennial Man would be better examples.&&Delivering quite the original quote ""we're not so different you and I"".&&Promotion then. &&Alien Resurrection is a fascinating movie. Written by Joss Whedon and directed by Jean-Paul Jeunet, essentially it's Serenity done in the style of City of Lost Children (or Amelie), and it totally doesn't work.&&Covenant didn't achieve guiding your imagination around the horrible possibilities of being stuck somewhere with an alien/aliens - the first two really did.

Covenant was all ""oh fuck theres a fucking xenomorph right there!"" 
&&Well Covenant isn't even about the alien whatsoever. It's about a mad android. &&It really stands out that the crew of a mining operation is better at handling a situation than people hired *specifically* to explore planets or to colonize. The writing on Covenant and Prometheus is just garbage in comparison. Alien also contains one of the most realistic crew conversations I have seen in a movie. They all come off as regular people doing their jobs and then later being contractually forced to deviate from the norm. In the end most of them still keep their shit together. Unlike the people in the other two movies that are trained for exploration and science and continually do stupid shit. Seriously, the crew of the Covenant seem like the most inept settlers ever. There should be a shitload of protocol to follow and contingencies in-case of emergency and yet none of them acted like they were on a completely alien world or that *nothing* made sense. The biggest slight to me is that Covenant made me appreciate *Prometheus* and that is saying something.&&I had pretty apathetic thoughts going into ""her"" and I ended up loving it.

I've been listening to Equal Rites lately and it's been so much fun&&Weaver is in the new Oats Studios episode 'Rakka'. She's definitely the lead asskicker&&Yeah she did. I just finished watching Zygote. Scary as shit. &&Oh, but you didn't know? Everyone on that ship was just a normal everyday guy, and we all know normal everyday guys HATE science, so they will immediately do anything in their power not to learn. A scientist sees a strange fungus? He'd probably at least wear some protective clothing instead of sticking his face in it and taking a big whiff. A scientist would probably want a more detailed analysis of the atmosphere without going ""Oh hey, it's probably breathable, and the ship says there's no bacteria!"" and immediately taking off their helmet. A scientist who designed a quarantine area on a landing ship would think ""Hey, this glass portal is pretty fragile.

This did add a small amount of social commentary - the crew was lower class, basically the coal miners of the future.  I've always liked that part of the movie but the original writer, Dan O'Bannon, certainly did not.  If you have a chance to watch the movie with commentary it's very interesting, he certainly does not hold back his thoughts on the matter.&&I think Aliens definitely had some messages in there. Most notably the dangers of large corporations having too much power and of private militaries.&&Alien was definitely about something.

The xenomorph pregnancy. The rape allegories. The whole thing about motherhood.&&> the point of sci-fi is to be social commentary

I'm not sure this is entirely true, sometimes it's exploring the implications of different events or technologies.

Alien is an excellent space horror film, and Aliens is a war movie, but Alien 3 touched on themes to do with religion and death. 

Just don't watch the theatrical cut. The Assembly Cut is the only cut.&&Isn't that exactly why it's progressive? The movie shouldn't have to act like a strong female lead is crazy or unrealistic. Just being a regular protagonist without it being obvious social commentary is pretty much the entire objective.&&Sort of. Alien made a big impact by casting a bunch of highly respected actors... and Sigourney Weaver. The movie then killed those actors in short order letting the audience realise Weaver was actually in the lead. Putting a little known female actor in the lead over these known actors, a strong independent leading role at that made quite a few waves around the release.

I wouldn't call it tackling an issue but Alien's depiction of a blue collar working ship was also really original at the time. Ridley spend a lot of time setting the ship up as a believable group of workers, right down to the tired discussions about unfair pay compared to the officers at the breakfast table.

The believable setting did a lot to lift the movie to a whole different level compared to traditional monster and slasher movies.&&""WELL...FUCK THAT!"" &&*i have ONE job!*&&Outside of Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country the Trek movies have always been more pulpy sci-fi action blockbuster or sfx extravaganzas than thoughtful Trek fare.

This is why I cringe when people cite hunger games as empowering for women.

The whole plot around what's her face in hunger games is that she's special for who she is, and is famous for being a victim, so they have her do like commercials and public relations crap. The whole time, from square one, she's been getting saved by boys left and right.. Then of course you've got the typical chick flick love triangle where a girl has the horrible position of having to choose which of two guys who are in love with her that she wants to be with..

Wait, what? I mean I do prefer Alien but that's only cause I prefer the Scifi horror aspect more than Scifi action. But they're *pretty much* on par.

Blomkamp should've done it 100%.

It's obvious Blomkamp is a true fan of the themes of Alien.

Something Scott forgot how it feels like.&&I liked it but I was not happy that Elizabeth Shaw's character was virtually abandoned, and the engineers story didn't amount to much. The fact that David just kills them all in a flash back was ridiculous especially since they showed the first part of that flashback in a teaser.

I liked Prometheus more. &&The movie had its flaws but I definitely enjoyed it and Michael Fassbender's David was my favorite villain of any movie ever.&&My problem with Covenant wasn't really that it was a bad movie so much as that the parts without Michael Fassbender's involvement were pretty bland and forgettable. I really liked watching it whenever he was on screen because that's when the more mysterious things were happening. Aside from that, it just felt like a remake of the first Alien.&&Past alien movies showed scientists and engineers with real wit and intelligence battling a horrifying creature. More recent alien films feel like a bad thrasher film. Idiotic people get killed for the idiocy.

Let’s let the man piloting our entire expedition have the psyche of someone who would fly the ship into a planet to save his probably already dead wife. Just too much stupidity.”)&&For those complaining and want a gripping alien story, I waaay suggest you play Alien: Isolation. That game had me on edge constantly! Every bump in the air vents or hissing souns from the pipes had me thinking the Alien was right on my tail. 

The story is good too! You get to unravel the mystery of how it got on the Savastapol Station as you play. Obviously the Aliens presence is no surprise to the player but the way it shows up is pants shittingly scary. &&It's a good enough sci-fi film, in a watch once and enjoy it but forget it exists kinda way, but its a bad Alien film.&&Personally I hated Prometheus (the whole origin of mankind crap) and I found Covenant to correct all the errors from Prometheus and be cool again. I think I am one of the only ones..

People that liked Prometheus are pissed because the story developed there got scrapped, people that hated Prometheus don't like it because it scrapped the beginning of idea Prometheus had without connecting to what they wanted either.

Although, it was what I wanted, I enjoyed it a lot.&&It was way better than Resurrection and maybe better than 3. What we're getting now is miles better than what we would have gotten if they decided to continue from Resurrection. &&I liked it too; I don't see what all the hate is for. &&It was good as a reboot, I agree.

Lots small things kinda contradicted some things from Alien, so a reboot is the only way to look at it. I feel like Scott wanted his moment to make a modern Alien action movie like plenty have already done. And for that, it was pretty okay.

As an addition to the Alien ethos, it can be forgotten like AvP, Prometheus, Resurrection. Alien3 escapes simply because they killed Ripley, ending that story thankfully.&&I loved it, however I was desperate for a new space movie. I thought Franco and McBride would make it too cheesy, but they weren't so bad. The characters onboard could've been written better because I didn't sympathize much with them. Crossing fingers for another film like it!&&I thought it was great! Can't seem to find many people that agree with me.&&I was a bit meh on Covenant at first, but I've warmed to it and now like it.

My biggest problem is that it felt too rushed. The slow, methodical pacing of Alien was essential to its success, and while we shouldn't just copy the original (it wouldn't work anyway), the rushing around makes a lot of the character deaths lack much weight. I only cared about the death of maybe three characters in Covenant (the two women in the shuttle and the incompetent captain). Alien made you care about all seven members of the crew.

I want to see David's story finished with a smaller budget that helps give the movie some constraints to help them think smaller in a way that helps the film.&&I really loved the movie to be honest but all I see online is people carefully picking apart the plot points.&&What was wrong with it? It's got 71% on Rotten and their reviewers are notoriously picky.&&Source? The latest news from a couple of days ago was that Fox was disappointed and were evaluating the future of the franchise in light of Covenant. &&Why? I feel like his skill set wouldn't translate to a taut horror/sci-fi very well. &&I dunno man, x men apocalypse was kinda shite but I'd still watch it again for more of Fassbender's Magneto. Although if that's what I wanted I'd watch the previous two that were actually pretty sweet.&&> James Cameron doing better with something he started

lol no. 

I mean, if you like action, *Aliens* is for you. But it isn't better than *Alien*. It's just a different genre. 

I think it's the right decision to leave Ripley behind. I think exploring the space jockey/engineers is the most interesting story left to tell in the Alien universe. And I don't think it lacks explosion or blazing guns.&&If David is the true creator of the species, and did not simply reverse engineer the engineer's work, why was their a mural showcasing a xenomorph and facehugges in Prometheus? Ridley Scott can't make up his mind. He keeps making it as he goes along. 


That's happened with Alien: Covenant and Prometheus now where Ridley has had to explain things after people have seen the movie. You get a well written movie where it's left open to interpretation and discussion: Which reality was Cobb in at the end of Inception?Is Deckard a replicant? What was the gelatinous spear that came out of Donnie Darko's chest?

But with Alien: Covenant and Prometheus, there is mostly general confusion, until Ridley has to clumsily step forward and explain parts of his films because he didn't communicate them effectively in the first place.

&&The problem was that it gave very unsatisfying answers. It turned a franchise that revolved around an unknowable presumably extinct alien engineer species and the incredibly hostile alien creature.

The entire franchise revolves around humanity and the vastness and the dangers of the universe. The first alien species we find is a seemingly extinct alien species. The second contact is an incredibly hostile species with the potential to wipe humanity out if it can spread.

Almost every movie underlines the absolute isolation and loneliness of humanity in space as Ripley and her fellow protagonists struggle against this unknowable creature while getting betrayed by the petty greed of their fellow humans.

Then prometheus rolls around and it shrinks this wonderful sense of a vast, lonely, dangerous universe right back down. Oh the engineers were our creators and they live right around the galactic corner. Let's go see them with a crew of incompetent morons for the most petty reasons imaginable. I don't feel like dying.

And after prometheus, covenant rolls around to make the whole setting even more petty. The engineers made us, we made a childish android with delusions of grandeur and the childish android went bonkers and adapted the engineer's bioweapon to kill humanity.

It's like watching someone take a master piece and rewrite it until he has a petty cliche left over.&&Yeah! I was very satisfied with the story behind the engineers and why David decided to kill them all! &&It's not that bad, in fact, if you don't mind a bit of a throwback dumb horror combined with some themes from Prometheus, you'll be fine. It's just that it's disappointing - it doesn't really provide any closure to anything that happened in Prometheus, and the Alien stuff is simply overused and unoriginal at this point. &&Yup.

Star Wars is sci-fantasy, where the technology is a part of the aesthetic rather than an integral part of the theme. Star Wars with knights and magicians would still, ultimately, be Star Wars, and that's because it was specifically written to follow the tropes and archetypes of the Campbellian Hero's Journey. Star Trek alternates between Sci-fantasy and sc-fi with episodes. Some, like episodes concerning Data's humanity, are classic Sci-fi, as they could not be written without concepts that derive from the technology (AI in this case), while others (usually any that overuse technobabble or solve problems by reversing the polarity) are more fantasy, or sometimes social allegory.

This is all nit-picky literary taxonomy though, and in common usage, there's nothing wrong with using 'sci-fi' as a more aesthetic descriptor, because outside of academic spaces, it is a broad term that encompasses many genres.&&I blame Star Wars in large part for that. I think early on it set in people's minds what SciFi is...the wrong way.&&[deleted]&&I think the ""space fantasy adventure"" is a very important part of Sci-fi though. I dont think a Sci-fi movie always has to have some important social issue as its theme. I enjoy the escapism of Sci-fi and lately there has actually been a lack of escapist Sci-fi movies as most of them are about predictions and scientific progress. They all seem like they are trying to push some big message and trying to relate to real world issues. Thats fine and dandy but what about movies like The Thing? I think it has great themes of isolation and paranoia, ""Cabin Fever"". But its not trying to preach some message about current world issues. I feel like majority of the Sci-fi movies that have been coming out are too ""realistic"" there needs to be more fantasy/fiction in my opinion. &&Or that it is ""science + fiction"" like Gravity. If Gravity is sci-fi then Bones and House MD are also sci-fi. Just dramas that happen to involve a type of science and present-day technology.&&Space Opera is just a sub-genre of Science Fiction the same way a Parody is just a sub-genre of Comedy. They're related in the sense that all Space Operas are Science Fiction but not all Science Fiction films are Space Operas.&&Space (area) and time are the base of a settling, what we do within it defines the genre.

Get Chiwutel Eijofor to play Ai.&&So it wasnt just me thinking that. Yay!&&Agree, Alien hinted at certain themes through dialogues and symbolism. But it is essentially a claustrophobic horror movie.&&The big takeaway from ALIENS is that it's an allegory for the Vietnam war. Inexperienced officers, technological hubris in the face of a primitive, larger force. Additionally the stuff with Burke is a representation of the idea that the U.S. entered Vietnam for corporate reasons. Personally, I love that about the film. The secondary theme is motherhood as a force of nature, i.e. Ripley's fierce protection of Newt against the Queen's violent retribution for her own ""children."" It is my favorite in the franchise.&&I just watched this again. It's been awhile since I'd seen it and there were things I had never picked up on. I'm sure I'm the slowpoke to this realization, but the way Ripley acts in the beginning is so much like (not sure how to put this) someone who has been sexually abused. It mirrors the violation, having something alien inside you (on the nose), battling with the nightmares and depression, and the incredibly courageous act of staring your fear in the face and facing it, which Ripley does when she changes her mind and takes on the mission.

Weaver's acting is so intense and raw. In a way, it's almost a shame, because I've never been able to Sigourney Weaver as anything but Ripley. Even in Ghostbusters. Everything she does as Ripley is completely believable and she conveys so much with her face, it's astonishing.

Ripley consistently stands up for herself throughout the movie, she demands respect and backs it up with her actions. When she's briefing the crew and they're acting flippant, she takes control and makes her point in all seriousness. 

The compassion she has and the empathy she shows towards Newt is very powerful too, and simply acted. She knows too well the trauma Newt has been through and what she would have had to do to survive. 

The fact that she even goes down to the surface and doesn't stay in the orbit ship is super gutsy too, she's the only one who really knows what's down there. 

OK, I'm just gushing at this point but, seriously, Ripley is badass. 


One more thing, it's peak James Cameron (there are so many parallels between this and Avatar I'd never caught. Maybe it's just how Cameron sees stories or something. The same faceless corporation, the same smug, double-crossing, young corporate hawk. The dropships are eerily similar. The same sort of aesthetic to the soldiers - it's the future but they are grubby, wear aviators in spaeships, atc. There are huge, world-changing machinery on both worlds - terraforming and mining. The Aliens Lieutenant that first meets her and the lead of Avatar look eerily similar. Of course they both have ~~Ripley~~  Weaver in them.

Also I hadn't realized James Horner did the score. 


And if that wasn't enough, it's got a totally bitchin'[Reebok shoe](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--t5bYoQH_--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/abkr6jsh6bkyohbpvafw.jpg)&&I agree. Alien 3 is personally my favorite; I just rewatched it last night.

Alien is a great space horror with a nice slow buildup and a lot of creepy stuff to it. Basically the perfect introductory movie to the series.

Aliens is a great edge of your seat action movie, but I think it went far enough with the action that it gave people very different expectations for Alien 3. I think people expected more guns, more aliens, just all around bigger, more intense, and constant action like aliens.

Alien 3 had so many great things going for it. It digs deeper into the company being this inhumane entity where people are disposable, especially 'a bunch of lifers who found god on the ass end of space'. The opening sequence is great. Charles Dance discovering the ripley and the wrecked ship, with the shot of him running across the desolate mining colony with some of the most intense music from the series playing... Then the funeral sequence intertwined with the alien being born... The motivational speaches from ripley and dillon before the third act. The character arcs from some of the prisoners, and 85... The whole you've been a part of my life so long I can't remember anything before you from ripley (even though it's only been a couple of months from her point of view, and that's including her therapy in the beginning of aliens) really hits home just how much this thing has turned her existence into some kind of living hell.

So much good stuff in this movie, but it gets thrown under the bus because a lot of people wanted/were expecting more soldiers vs lots of aliens with big gun battles and grenades, etc, etc, but they got more of a psychological horror where people have to figure out how to kill this thing with no guns.&&[deleted]&&Yeah, it's like the guy hasn't even seen the original ten Star Trek movies.&&Yeah, it looks like it's a continuation of the action based universe.&&Definitely, there's this idea that to empower them, they have to shed their femininity and become masculine. Catelyn Stark, and others, own their feminine aspects, their strength doesn't come from being man like, it comes from being a woman.&&The best female characters are the ones that aren't written to be male or female, they're just written as characters. As I've heard a few people say ""Female isn't a character trait"", write your character and cast an actor and don't worry about what kind of equipment they've got in their pants.

Rey from Star Wars is actually an excellent example of this, she could have as easily been a guy and you wouldn't have had to rewrite a single line in TFA. She wasn't the greatest character ever written, I grant you, but she was a decently written character for whom gender was completely irrelevant (not that that's stopped Disney Marketing from flogging her girl-ness from here to the bright light at the center of the Galaxy).&&All of the characters in *Alien* were written gender neutral.&&My point is that they dont need to make the female character ""extra-ordinary"" to make her empowering. She can be a normal person just like Ripley. Seems like 95%+ of females in movies are just pretty faces, or the entire premise of the movie is empowering women like in Hidden Figures where it just feels shoved in your face. Alien, and the other Alien movies were not about empowering women, they just happened to have a female lead role who was fucking awesome. &&Such a funny name for a movie &&Considering everything else that movie got wrong, I wouldn't mind if she was Waller anyway. 

Hell, they made Deadshot black, why can't Waller be white? &&Work hard or die trying, girl &&I wrote it. Thanks!&&I absolutely agree with you. The only thing I'll add is that awards give prestige. A lot of main stream movie viewers don't usually consider Sci-Fi a legit genre but a lot of people I know saw movies like The Martian or Moon (and are excited to see Valerian) because of the critical acclaim. 

If Sci-fi movies had its own awards category producers would be more likely to fund them. Particularly the non blockbuster Sci-Fi movies. They would be more apt to put money behind ""Oscar bait"" Sci-Fi films which I think would be a win for viewers and fans of the genre both. 


I'll also add that while awards may be useless I still think that people who make them deserve to stand in front of their fans and peers and be recognized. Sci-Fi more than any other genre of media has influenced my life and I want the people who create it to be acknowledged and praised for what they've done for me and people like me. 

(I didn't know how much I cared about this topic until I actually started writing this post. Thanks Reddit!) 

Edit-changed a word. 

Double edit- I'll add Ex Machina to the list of Sci-Fi movies that most non fans I know also saw and liked. &&There *are* The Saturn Awards, but ya know, awards are supposedly ""a fucking joke,"" so... pick your poison.

There are at least very strong elements of scifi, the main McGuffin is a beefed up video. They go into extensive detail regarding technology and the societal consequences (e.g. image phones). It takes place in a dystopia, etc.

In all honesty, I'm not so sure of my example, sci-fi is just one of the genres present in Infinite Jest. I'd modify the 'at all' though.&&Better start investing in a space ship.

James Cameron spent time with the people's in the Amazon (I'm heavily paraphrasing here cause it's been so long) but he was dismayed to find their world being destroyed in the interests of industry. So Avatar came to be.&&Yep. Like I said in another comment it seems like all new Sci-fi movies try to have some kind of message that relates to a current world issue. How about instead of trying to push a message you just focus on creating a thought provoking piece of art, and if you can subtlety throw in some important themes that relate to societies problems then bonus points! Like I said I think Bladerunner does it PERFECTLY. &&Well you most certainly can set out to write a political message and then write the story afterwards - look at for example Orwell's 1984 as a shining example of this - but you need to be a *very* good writer to pull it of.

But maybe that's the point? We're supposed to root for the xenomorphs or the androids? I dunno.&&> Past alien movies showed scientists and engineers with real wit and intelligence battling a horrifying creature


Only the original. 
&&Because back then they wanted to make a real movie not w backdrop for cgi. &&I think Cameron's Aliens has a bit to do with that, but he also did some things right by the series.&&That's actually pretty high praise, given that Alien + Aliens remain unparalleled in the genre. Maybe Carpenter's *The Thing*, but largely the flagship film(s) stand above all others. Besides, I never expect sequels/prequels to measure up, as they could be almost as good but still suffer for lack of their predecessor's novelty.

I loved Covenant, despite its flaws, because of David's story and its relevance to AI's evolving role in modern life. &&This is exactly what I said! I enjoyed Prometheus and Covenant because I went into them expecting to not see an Alien movie. They'd be alright as a separate franchise. They make me think that Ridley Scott has no understanding of what actually made Alien and Aliens so good. &&You are definitely not the only one. Covenant would have needed to be a 10/10 sci-fi masterpiece in order for reddit to not shit all over it. This sub was determined to hate the movie just because its a Prometheus sequel. &&I agree both with your hate for prometheus, and your like for covenant. I definitely thought it was worthwhile to watch. Also, Fassbender's character was really enticing. The acting was on-point and the character just fascinated me. &&Doesn't Rotten just take reviewers from all official places and average them out? &&kinda shite is a complete understatement for that pile&&Aliens as a whole is more immersive. Cameron is objectively better at story telling and world building. It's hard to keep something truly scary beyond its first movie. You know what to expect. I think the horror vs action aspect of the Alien debate is very shallow. Aliens wasn't a true horror movie because it couldn't be.&&He's gone full George Lucas with it. &&I dont think David created the OG Xenomorph. I think he created a version of it that we know now. The engineers, given the glyphs depicting the alien, had already created it or knew of it in some way. So David furthered its evolution.&&David was not the true creator of the xenomorphs we know and love. In a similar fashion to convergent evolution; when David began experimenting with the genome, he merely arrived at the same, perfect, conclusion that the Engineers had already arrived at centuries earlier, as evidenced by the ancient ship carrying the eggs in the first movie. &&Well, we did get some Fassbender on Fassbender action....isn
t that what we all wanted? &&Ramen to that.&&Which is ironic because star wars is much more fantasy than scifi, at its core.&&If anything it's space adventure or military scifi that's been dying while more grounded scifi has been growing. 

Over a few years BSG (which itself was in the more grounded, ""scifi to tell a message"" mold), Stargate SG1, Atlantis and Universe ended and weren't replaced.

Meanwhile we had a rush of scifi on TV including 'scifi that doesn't talk about being scifi"". You could see it in stuff like Terra Nova, where it was ""this is a story about a family..."" and all the other shows inspired by Lost, or new shows like Orphan Black and so on.&&I just want a good Dune movie, I mean the mini series was awesome but still&&Well, I would add ""that is exaggerated to some degree"" at the end.&&[deleted]&&""people fear that which they do not understand""&&These are things I know!&&""...boys, time we change too""&&I was just thinking the basketball scene and the kill me scene were the most garbage scenes..

The scenes you mention are all highlights, and I actually quite like the concept of a not-fully-human Ripley blurring the lines of a series that has previously been about war between humans and aliens. It just had a lot of tonal issues with the attempts at dark comedy, and the whole thing looked cheap, especially the aging CGI.&&He ended up loving it.&&There's a lot to like in Alien 3, but it's as different from Aliens as Aliens was from Alien. I can see why people might have gone in with the wrong expectations. But then, David Fincher was never going to do a James Cameron film.

That said, the whole thing suffered really badly in the theatrical cut. I really disliked it until I saw the proper (Assembly) cut in a pre-Covenant Alien marathon recently.&&Couldn't agree more. I love Rey but the way it was marketed was a bit over the top. I do get why though. &&I find that boring, tbh.

As a massive Alien fan (I wrote a long comment the other day about this whole thing), nothing after Alien 3 counts in my mind. I'm not being a snob but they're just not very good stories. Covenant was downright rage-inducing. I cannot get over how actually fucking bad it was. I could write a novel picking it apart scene by scene without coming up with one positive thing to say about it. *Maybe* the Protomorph but even that was ridiculous. I used to feel dread and tension whenever the Xeno was around (to this day I somewhat do even though I've seen Alien a trillion times), I laughed watching this movie. The bad CGI didn't help. &&Honestly, that's any genre. Anything that gets literary merit becomes ""literary fiction""&&> His work is rarely recognized as sci-fi by the literary powers that be

It scared the living hell out of me. If you stick with the game though it's pretty rewarding.&&It's way more fun with the immersive alien mod.

Normally the AI has a tether on it, so the alien has to be within a certain distance of the player.  This (understandably) makes it show up fairly predictably and far too often.  With the mod it shows up much more unexpectedly and so the times when it does are truly ""oh fuck!"" moments, and you don't just get sick of being forced to wait in lockers *constantly* for it to go away.&&Why not ask me about stress-relieving protocols? &&True.  
I will continue playing it if I have more time.&&I'm imagining a scenario where she is woken up remotely from stasis on a facility in space which is being overrun by xenos (not necessarily XX21).

No. Reddit. No.

It was not remotely a remake. It had some visuals and themes that recalled multiple bits of multiple earlier films but even the alien-like half of the movie didn't achieve (or attempt) the claustrophobic slow-burn tension of Alien.

Case in point is the Xenomorph on the bonnet of a mini-spacecraft trying to headbutt his way in - that wouldn't have made it into the first Alien movie even if they had the tech.&&Lmao that last sentence&&Spoiler quotes should be like:

You can't really write a gender-neutral character if the point of your story is to relate how someone overcame sexism in a male-centric industry or world.

But if those elements aren't important to the story, then there's no reason to try and emphasize them just to make the point of how your character is female.

Rey and Luke are both Gender-neutral as far as characters go. The parts of their character history that is important is them being orphans wanting to get out there and find their destiny. If it had been Lucy Skywalker the only thing they would have had to rewrite is the suggestion she had a crush on Leia (and nowadays even that's fine to leave in), because the differences in the character from a male and female upbringing are basically irrelevant to the story being told.&&Man I needed my best fork to eat that delicious pasta up&&It does look like that.

I'm throwing the glove down. Alien 3 was good, but lacked something that gripped me like Alien and Aliens. 

Resurrection bucked the expectations and did its own thing, and I love it, the cast is just so much more interesting than...Charles Dance, the only memorable part of Alien 3.

&&So much of why the latest Alien movies are disappointing is because they're such departures from the original. We went from suspense horror space monster, which didn't matter where it came from or who made it because who's got time for that when it's killing your minimum wage space crew, to space Bible, where the plot is so cosmic that it doesn't matter who lives and dies as long as we learn something about mythos I guess. Both have a place, sure, but *Alien* needed no explanation and everyone could be terrified. Ridley Scott is too far up his mythos hole he's ignoring what made the originals so appealing to a wide audience was the intense focus on the people and their insular conflict.

Geeks aren't easily impressed by the latest trends in web design for the most part and emphasise function over form.&&It's up for an emmy in outstanding writing&&Then you are truly lost!&&I think the issue is that the Academy (and other voting bodies) still see animated stuff as inferior to life action movies. So there is the ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscar like there is an award for Documentaries etc but this results in them otherwise being mostly ignored for the non technical awards - best director, (adapted) screenplay, editing and so on (an exclusion is best song where they are strong due to the lack of life action musicals).

And yes, people (and american audiences more so than others) crave feel good stories. *Wall-E* ends on a very positive note but the world it envisions is pretty depressing due to a failure of humanity to be better. Stories where people fight as tuff conditions are popular, where people fight ""bad people"" are popular but the general notion of humanity failing at something is *very* unpopular, the same goes for unavoidable desaster.

You see that craving for this warm fuzzy feeling especially in stuff like war movies, you might see people blowing up, warcrimes committed but in the end most movies will try to make you feel proud of the (good) people who went through this, feel sad for the sacrifices etc - filmmakers will give all that senselessness some positive connotation by connecting it to patriotism, family etc. 

Granted when looking at the Best Picture winners you have movies like *Spotlight, The Hurt Locker, No Country for Old Men, American Beauty* which I wouldn't exactly call feel good, *Spotlight* is an ode to investigative journalism and in that positive and statisfying and kinda ends on an upnote (the calls) but still delivers a  [gut punch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zilj4Y0VBGI) after that.

It's a bunch of complete hacks using Bill Nye as a platform/mouth-piece to essentially scream their half-formed opinions to an already pre-convinced choir without so much as lifting a finger to appeal to skeptics. It takes on an all too familiar and ineffective ""You're an idiot if you don't agree with this"" mentality. 

It's too dumbed down for adults and too mature for children. It's overly aggressive with its opinions, any and all opposition on the discussion panels gets ridiculed or overridden by both Nye and the people he agrees with. 

It's a shit-show and I honestly feel bad that these people were the best they could find to write an adult science show. America grew up with Bill Nye and people from both political isles and all walks of life respected him. Netflix had a genuine opportunity to make a hard-hitting, science-based show that was educational to adults and backed up by numerous studies and tests and they just...squandered it and ruined Bill Nye. 

This is coming from someone who agrees with most if not all of the subjects the show covers. The only thing that's outstanding about the writing is how outstandingly bad it is. &&I think the idea behind his point is valuable. I don't think his point is valuable.

With the caveat of Alien 1 being something of a different league, of course.   But 3 has vastly outpaced 2 in my mind, and I highly suggest a revisit if you're a fan and don't think it worthy.     All opinions vary, but since it took my a long time to see through the veil I want to urge you on, in the hopes that maybe you'll find a pearl where you once saw shite. &&Just watched the scene again. It sort of sounds like mama but, yeah, not really.&&I loved Resurrection as a kid.

I rewatched it recently, very worried that it wouldn't hold up at all..

And I still enjoyed it a lot.

I say Ripley because Resurrection didn't even have Ripley. Just a clone who looked but didn't act like her.

Alien 3 had a much better story than the ""lets just set a load of alien loose on a ship and have some lulz along the way"" approach of resurrection. But if that's what you're into.

Also 3 was much more beautifully shot and had a far better creature design.

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6n28se/i_am_neill_blomkamp_director_of_chappie_district &&Funhaus had a really good interview with him a week or so ago. It really highlights how much he cares about his projects, and what he wants to accomplish with them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YpX6MumIr8&t=1s&&Maybe start producing low budget, full length movies, too? You know, to pay the bills...worked for Jason Blum at least (Split, Get Out).&&I think it's entirely commendable, but he's going to lose a lot of money here. &&I love it. While the quality of Oats 1 was quite variable, the sheer creativity and inventiveness of the world building, and the leaps and bounds the quality has made from episode to episode are more than enough to keep me interested. The most recent episode Zygote was pretty close to fantastic.

Definitely something I could see myself contributing to in some kind of patreon style relationship in the future - a true content generation platform for creativity.

&&I hope this takes off.

Giving young filmmakers chances early can really only be a good thing in the long run. They get exposure early, hopefully some real buzz around their names, get given more chances and hopefully work with more and more outsole helping them learn earlier than they might otherwise.&&[deleted]&&Millions and millions!&&Good.  His shorts have been better than so many big budget films I have seen recently.  I loved Rakka exponentially more than Alien Covenant. &&Blomkamp needs a good writing partner. His visual style is incredible but he's just not that good of a screenwriter. Chappie and Elysium both suffered heavily because of this and the dialogue and writing even in some of these shorts (River god one in particular) was pretty bad. &&Didn't know he was that rich. &&The shorts are amazing! Rakka and Firebase blew me away. I'll definately buy Vol. 1 on Steam.&&I like this guy. &&I watched a couple and they are well put together. Earnestly hope this succeeds. &&He is a great director, not a good storyteller. If he hires GOOD writers, people who actually really know how to construct character and plot, he can do marvellous things. Zygote was pretty cool, but firebase was a disaster storywise. And Rakka, again, was not very good on the exposition. So much potential here, he and his peeps should just humble themselves and get some good writers on board.&&I'm pro-indie, massively pro-indie, but he needs to hire some writers.  And not overrule them when they hand in a script that tests well.  Because the issue with his work thus far has been ""wow, pretty ... wait, what's going on and why is it not making any sense?""  Empty story, or completely absent story.

Fix that and he can finally blow things open for video storytelling in a very high profile manner.  But the shorts I've seen thus far on his Youtube channel are more of the same.  Tons of ""pretty"" and no writing.&&Just started watching *Firebase*. Holy shit, this is some damn good material.&&In the likely event that Oats Studios is skimming the comments, I just wanted to say: Love it. Every piece has been thoroughly entertaining and reinforces my love for Blomkamp and everything he's involved with!  &&These movies are awesome. Watched Zygote last night, it was great. Kind of crazy, Dakota Fanning is all grown up.&&""millions and millions""????  Isn't ""millions"" pretty much the same thing?&&Did no one learn anything from American Zoetrope? 

Good luck to him, but it's a tough gig to do the 'studio without being a studio' thing.

http://variety.com/1997/film/news/forerunner-to-dreamworks-coppola-s-risky-zoetrope-studios-bucked-system-1118/&&How about he tries making a second good movie.&&I watched the short films he's put up on Steam already. They're pretty good considering the longest one is like 24 minutes long. I'd love it if he made them longer; I'd probably pay for them if he did. I love his style of sci-fi, it really scratches an itch that most modern sci-fi doesn't scratch for me&&Well all I know is everything Oats Studios has released has been nothing short of fantastic. The concepts, the cinematography, and the effects are all pretty amazing.&&Lol @ the not wanting corporate ads to finance things... good luck with that.&&Where does he get millions and millions from? 2 of his films were absolute flops&&What a preachy title, God damn.&&And God bless him for it. I'm really enjoying their stuff, so far.&&The assets on the steam store looks great.&&Please, let them make a longer version of ""Rakka"" I'm loving the new direction he's moving. &&watch Rakka (the one with Sigourney Weaver), it's pretty great, and left me wanting more...&&Sounds like a terrible business plan that will eventually implode just like all the other plans like this. Short films aren't profitable.

Hopefully they make a few more things before the lights are turned off.&&You go but I dont think you will make it.&&His projects are perfect for Netflix and Amazon — Studios that are taking risks and getting away from the problems that blight Hollywood. I can see a series by Blomkamp in the similar vein of Black Mirror by Netflix / Brooker.&&When I hear producers directors say this I can't help but roll my eyes. &&He really needs to start putting ads on his videos then. &&I pitched him my three cyberpunk novels via email. Wish me luck. &&I love Neill's take on sci-fi.

He does such a great job of blending the gritty, dirty reality of organic lifeforms with the futuristic technologies in his films.&&Oats studios? Just has no ring to it. Might as well call it barnyard odor.&&He should also try making good movies for a change&&So, I can't help but contrast this with Joseph Gordon Leavitt's HitRecord, which had similar aims but went about it in a very different manner. JGL empowered creators to create and built a community around working together, being scrappy, and highlighting the best work among them.  That felt organic and studio free.

This, on the other hand, feels like a guy having a hard time getting funding for his films after a few high profile failures, who is now promoting himself and his investment far more than the work. ""No corporate ads!"" sounds like ""we can't get corporate ads!""

Something about the whole thing feels off. Maybe I am a cynic, but when people start bragging about how much they are risking and what they can lose I start thinking they care more about getting a return than they want to let on. 

He does have pedigree from the fact that he started with short films, meaning this isn't entirely out of character for him. It could be genuine. Not on board with what he is selling yet, though.&&I watched one of these short films (called Rakka) and it's impressive. How many other sci fi shorts have Sigourney Weaver and a similar level of production values?

If this is what Blomkamp can do with his own money, some studio should give him some backing and cut him loose to do a feature length version of this film.&&Makes a 2 hour Die Antwoord music video and calls it a movie.  

Wants to change Hollywood. &&[deleted]&&Let me admit first off that I'm definitely seeing this through my own filter, which is one where Blomkamp put out a pretty good first movie (District 9), an okay second movie (Elysium), and an absolute dumpster fire third movie (Chappie).

That being said, this sounds to me like he realized he had no clue what movie idea would be a successful full feature, so he should just pump out a bunch of short films to see what works, and then make the working one into a full feature.

But then he ran out of money making the first few shorts, and none of them was well-liked enough to make into a full feature, so now he wants to crowdfund his studio to keep trying to find something that works, in hopes of striking gold a second time with another District 9.

That's a hard pass from me.&&""...all of which will take place in south africa.""

Sheeeeeyiiiiiit&&Please hire someone to help you write Dialog, Neill, you excell at the aspects you care about, but human beings and their conversations clearly don't, and man... it's rough.&&Just wish there was an other option to host these movies other than youtube. 
I like YouTube, but we need more competition in that realm as well.&&Wish I had millions and millions of my own money to do things I love. &&All these crazy South Africans just throwing their money at improving their respective industries...&&Some already tried to do this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederator_Studios  

Amazon is doing it with the pilot program.  It's ironic he mentions ""get sidetracked by producing corporate ads to finance things.""  These are exactly what Oats Studios is creating, corporate ads for would-be films.  I'm sure it will result in some things, but it isn't cheap to do this and ROI is really difficult. &&does it have to read, ""millions and millions""....can't it just read ""millions""?&&He's going to get a Netflix deal, he has to. &&That's why this man is a hero. &&I mean...that's what so many producers and directors say.  But you gotta pay the bills somehow.

I work in advertising, and the amount of well known producers and directors with serious pedigree that still do ads is astounding.&&If anyone can get in touch with him or can point me to how to get in touch with him it'd be perfect if he looked into https://singulardtv.com its an ethereum token focused on bringing independence to the entertainment industry. &&I'd love to get a story to Neill....he's a great visionary but his writing has always been a bit weak. Granted I'm no fuckin' visionary or something, but with him opening this up, it's pretty fucking cool.&&All the Oats Studio stuff looks great, but the writing is painfully bad on most of them (the God short is pretty clever).


They feel like twenty minute pitches, for feature length, direct to video films.&&Was Chappie any good? It's the only movie of his I haven't seen yet, and it just popped up on my netflix. I quite enjoyed D9, and didn't mind elysium.&&Rakka is the shit &&Fire base, Rakka, and zygote were all awesome! &&I think he is on the right track. Just keep doing this. 

&&This man is one of the most amazing people in the industry. His movies are believable and raw. Yet still so rightly fantastical.&&Really enjoyed the first two shorts that we're released hopefully we see more.&&I still want a sequel to District 9. If something related to Chappie's ending gets thrown in, I won't complain.&&I don't blame him. I'd be fuming right now that Fox cancelled his Aliens sequel considering how shitty a movie Alien Covenant was. &&That's the main reason I want to get rich. Not to buy myself a big fancy house (though I'd like a nice big piece of nature with a moderate house to retire in) or a yacht, but to be able to start a company I want to start without having to sell my soul or the soul of my idea/dream.
Of course, I'll have to build up my first company from scratch, which is perfect for that AMA to ask how he did it. 
&&[deleted]&&And theyre fucking awesome.&&Those short films he recently released were fantastic!&&He should work with Netflix to get a series like Black Mirror; individual episodes in a Twilight Zone type thing&&I saw them on Steam today and thought 'What kind of game is this?' :D&&Well I hope he transforms the industry. I want to see more of Zygote and Rakka.&&Firebase was the shit. &&i just want to express how grateful i am for mr blomkamp to exist. thank you for your work i wish i'd know what to do in order to assure your ideals to flourish. i love those short film &&Should start a patreon, I'd give &&Cooking with Bill!&&Great Idea, that's what's missing in the modern film industry, no space for young peoply to test out their ideas. Also I really enjoyed the shorts. Hope he has success with this.&&If I had millions of dollars I would just not work and enjoy my millions of dollars.&&This dude doesnt have an ounce of originality.   

Everything on their channel is an occult hollywood regurgitation.   

Maybe if they gave us something original I would be impressed.&&Huh, my husband just chain watched all his videos on Steam with me last night. I don't watch movies or shows normally, what a coincidence.

My favorite was probably the Invasion one.&&Oats Studios movies are so fucking good. Criminally undersubbed YouTube channel right there.&&Hope his next project is better than Chappie!  Horrible film...&&Like I said before, when this falls through he'll be directing Transformers 6.&&There are rumors that this project is somehow related to Kojima's Death Stranding. This is interesting.

EDIT : Links as requested.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFpjVahSHQc) goes over some of the elements that would make someone think that. 

[Neil himself refuted the claims](https://twitter.com/NeillBlomkamp/status/881662192323403776)

But the announcement posted on r/DeathStranding and r/NeverGameOver are weird and spawned a lot of theories like the one in the video or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/6iidqn/theory_death_strandingpt_and_oats_studios/).

Even if Neill refuted, remember that this would be related to a project directed by Kojima, the man who said with a straight face in an interview that we wouldn't hear about his new title for a while the day before he announced Death Stranding and the man who advices things like ""do as I do, betray your audience"".

Also, [I'll just leave this here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/6ig1jp/oats_studio_new_video_damasu_%E9%A8%99%E3%81%99_in_japanese_means/)&&I loved district nine, but the next two he directed were subpar  in my opinion, i saw his new shortcuts and while entertaining to a degree I don't find them that good, i don't think he is aware he lacks the gravitas now to draw that big of an audience but oh well his world building is decent, lets hope he can regain the magic district nice had.&&He's creating a Newgrounds for films. Can't be a bad thing. &&Just my opinion, but thus far, I'm not overly impressed. 
The stories have been weak and the scripts are very thin character wise. The effects are awesome, that's the big deal, that and the money they can throw at the shorts. But, honestly? I'm not seeing anything outside of those two things that couldn't be done by someone with less cash and less access to FX.

I guess what I'm saying is, for all his money spent, it is a lot of spectacle and very little story. I'm hoping they spend some cash on writers going forward and hopefully this will help raise the quality of what Oats is putting out.&&Firebase is the shit.&&Maybe stop making complete dung like ""Chappie.""&&Wow what a hero. Yawn. &&[deleted]&&Too bad he lost so much credibility when he made that die antword music video that was chappie. &&I wish him well and all but 'Oats Studio' is the gayest name ever &&Sadly after District 9 his movies were all style over substance, similarly to Richard Kelly and his Donnie Darko he made one good movie and nothing even decent afterwards. His apartheid fetish and hammy ideology forced in every movie also didn't help. 

But hey, maybe his new studio will make way for other talented people, who knows.  &&I require öats&&This sounds like a third-grade teacher telling us she bought these crayons with her own money so be careful. No one gives a fuck&&A millionaire starting a corporation because he doesn't like the other corporations.
It doesn't seem very original to me.&&In other news, Blomkamp has millions and millions of dollars.&&Neill Blomkamp sounds like he would benefit greatly from SingularDTV.&&Why doesn't he just do a sci-fi anthology film?&&I am still curious as to what he is expecting financially out of this, in terms of sustainability. I really enjoyed the shorts they have put out so far, though I did find myself wanting the full story after the last 2. &&I enjoyed them all. I hope this is the future of independent sci Fi.&&Rakkar was awesome&&If only this guy did a fucking Halo 3 movie when he had the chance...&&Those things are fucking great&&Good for him! It's great to see creators willing to nickel and dime their own money to ensure artistic integrity in an industry that's been bloated by corporate and studio insight. &&... and they're great. &&He should have pooled his own money to do a full alien instead!!  

(Watched all his shorts, super good)&&Does he use kickstarter? I'm sure tons of people would finance him.&&The first films are awesome; they have a rough, realistic feeling that gives it tremendous credibility. It feels like Paul Verhoeven's grit but with more momentum and adrenaline - I surmise Fox is gonna be pissed they let Neill B. off the hook to ""fix Alien(Franchise)""
&&I hope Rakka makes it full length.&&OATS is one of the better YouTube production studios I've come across.  NODE and Corridor Digital are two other notable studios breaking out of the otherwise corporate veil over professional production studios doing great work.&&Ubik is just begging to be successful and open avenues for young filmmakers chances early can really only be a masterpiece..&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3955  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/24112)&&He recently discussed many of the questions i am seeing in an interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YpX6MumIr8) &&That's Chappie.&&Millions of someone ELSE's money (namely Steam). Not his own.&&Won't work. It either won't be commercially successful or the they won't be able to turn down the big $$$ and it will change.&&Laughed my butt off during the ""Cooking With Bill"" shorts.&&thankful people like him exist&&It's really cool that movies are still being made&&The shorts so far have fantastic visuals ..but they are really too cheesy for my taste.dont care much for the characters at all unlike his full length films .&&These movie producers are crazy. Great movies don't need multi million dollar budgets, they just need heart and a goddamn good writer, not some writer from Lost who deserves a good punch in the gut for horrible scripts, and ruining good movies.&&Until this gets really successful and then he comes to the realization that he can make millions and millions and millions more with corporate involvement. But hey I'm all for the initial idea.&&This was an awesome interview! I highly recommend everyone go check it out.&&/\&&Came here to mention that&&Didn't expect to see a FH related comment&&I was just going to promote that video and their channel. The filmhaus stuff is great for you movie buffs and the rest of their gaming Content is very funny&&Wish MS would give him another shot at some Halo shorts.  Or alternatively, EA would give him some funds to do some Mass Effect shorts.&&Hypersensitive turbo pussy warning:  
If you're new to Funhaus and get easily offended you should limit yourself to this interview. The rest of the content is humorous and gaming focused, so don't take this shit too seriously.&&/\&&What he should do is adopt the Golan-Globus model (I think it was them) - create schlocky, inexpensive things that sell tickets and use the profits (hopefully) to fund independent projects. &&I think that's what they're setting up for.  Three of the shorts (Zygote, Rakka, and Firebase) are pretty full and set ups for larger works. 

Firebase in particular would grow into a great full length movie and the production quality is excellent (the others are well done too, but I particularly like the narrative style of Firebase) &&Yep. Do what Jason Blum did. Great podcast on it here: 

http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/29/521950337/episode-650-the-genius-behind-get-out&&I really enjoyed Split! It was a great return to form for M. Night Shyamalan.

Looking forward to the comic book thriller sequel with Glass.&&[deleted]&&Blair witch project was quite cheap









Budget: 60,000 USD
Box office: 248.6 million USD&&Did you read the article? He needs money to do that. Also, a lot of Blumhouse movies don't require a lot of special effects which saves on budget but Sci-Fi and especially the kind of films Neil makes and is into do and would be harder to pull off for cheap.&&Just make District 10 already. Should have been made a sequel years ago. &&If he did post-apocalyptic movies he can definitely do that on a budget. I wish him the most success. He's brilliant.&&That's called gambling.&&VFX and low budget don't really mix&&That's the end goal I believe, when all the shorts are out I believe the plan is to turn one of them into a feature. &&Tbf Blumhouse is on a completely different level to Oats. Blumhouse has consistently produced low budget horrors that make huge profits. They've been doing it for a fair few years now as well.

Oats is a startup helmed by a still relatively new director. The situations between Blomkamp and Blum aren't entirely comparable. &&Holy shit, i just learned the Split budget was only 9 million dollars. I never would have guessed. &&or you know, make a good movie? What was your last decent movie there Neill? District 9?&&In the short run, maybe. But I think the studios (and more importantly, Netflix and Amazon) are looking at this very closely. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd announce some sort of deal with Blomkaamp soon. &&My major concern is that he'll be making short films. No one watches short films, despite how much people claim to love them. There is no market there. Great news for young filmmakers though and I really commend the effort.&&Holy shit man I literally just checked out zygote and you were not kidding about it being close to fantastic..

Wow. 

https://youtu.be/pKWB-MVJ4sQ

The link for everyone to see it&&If you like them, you can buy the 3D assets, full quality video and other goods [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/633030/)  &&Maybe I missed it, but in Zygote did the creature not have another authorized finger or was it not intelligent enough to use it? The guy said it would know everything right? &&I had to laugh at one of the top comments on Zygote on Youtube; someone requested that he do a movie for the Dead Space franchise.

So, we have a director who's trying to cut out the middle-man between the creator and the audience by producing content without a publisher or corporate sponsorship to preserve the integrity of the art-form... and one of the top comments is requesting that he produce content for an IP that's owned by EA, who are not only infamous for driving creative talent into the ground with demands from corporate shit-wigs who don't understand the material but did so to such a degree with Dead Space that it's often used as the modern quintessential example of greed destroying creative vision.

*facedesk*&&Yeah I hope so too, I love the idea of what he's doing.
  
Im just really worried about the viability of this business model. It sounds great, but I saw a video with him and it also sounds risky as hell. He has a full team working on a payroll plus all the expenses of running this, and he has no real idea how they're actually going to make money and just figure things along as they go. How much money can they realistically make selling the assests on Steam for example. My best hope is that a studio sees one of the shorts and wants to make it into a movie, so they can keep doing their thing.
  
Otherwise it won't last long.&&Probably easier to just do a Go Fund Me.

This idea eventually comes back to the reality that you need an investor to make a film and very few investors are going to invest in inexperience.&&Get your fokkin' tentacle out of my face!&&prawnography&&Millions of billions of dollars&&Haven't seen alien covenant but Rakka was good, and it left me wanting to see more.&&Agreed. Firebase has so much bland and heavy-handed exposition. It does have a rather wonderful premise though.&&Yes! What I hoped someone would say. Even Zygote, which I loved, had a lot of unnecessary exposition from that blind dude.&&I actually liked the IDEA of Firebase. An unkillable soldier vs a God. Yea, I would watch the hell out that.&&District 9 money are real&&Hollywood gives big money, and if you live basically anywhere else in the world, that big money goes a much longer way.&&now go watch Zygote&&His co-writer is a novelist. That might explain some of the longwinded exposition.&&Make sure to watch Rakka. Its incredible &&holy shit. I did not realize that was her. Thanks for that&&While I'm not a fan of Oats' offerings so far, comparing 1997 Zoetrope to 2017 Oats (or anything like it) is Apples and Garbage Cans. The internet distribution model did not exist in 1997, and Zoetrope still had to distribute their offerings through the studios who weren't inclined to give an upstart anything close to a good deal, thus gutting any profits and dooming them from the start.&&Hey. I like Chappie. Man alive is it flawed, but I like it.&&I thought Elysium was good&&No shit. What he doesn't get is you either get corporations to fund things or you become the corporation. &&and all he really has to do is get excited about this next alternative way to fund and connect with his audience. &&Agreed. &&>Joseph Gordon Leavitt's HitRecord, which had similar aims but went about it in a very different manner. 

Did it? I never knew HitRecord intended to produce Hollywood-level feature films. I thought it was more of a community for creatives, not an avenue for commercial products with high production value.&&That was I was thinking he's got so many ideas but he wants to control everything himself. Well if he has a Production Studio that means he has employees and while they're developing projects they could also be taking commercial work to pay for their day-to-day expenses... and getting premium work at premium prices because he's a name brand director.

He's duplicating Francis Ford Coppola's *One From The Heart* mistake.

&&Agreed. Spot on. I knew this reminded me of something
&&If he's trying to build a production company, directing all of the shorts himself was a mistake. If he's trying to make a feature, making a company was a mistake, no one's giving 200 million to a business that's produced 4 short films. 


I really want him to be successful and open avenues for young filmmakers, but I'm also very septical about this approach, I've seen youtube community's grow around creators, but never starting like this, with such huge overheads.&&Even if there was, what is left still isn't worth watching.&&> twenty minute pitches

It's pretty clear that that's what they are, yeah?&&I thought it was fine but nothing I'd watch again. It could have been much better with a couple tweaks. Not casting die antwood being top of that list &&I think that's exactly what he's doing... spending it on something he's passionate about and loves doing&&I liked chappie more than Elysium, although that's not saying a whole lot...&&Chappie was baddie?&&Honestly, I'd be okay if he took over the Transformers franchise. He's a better action and vfx director than Michael Bay, and the scripts for those movies are already shit so he can't ruin them that way.&&Star wars IXX&&With Sigourney Weaver taking over the Megan Fox role.&&lol I like how Neil said: "" no I am not working with Hideo"" but the rumors still go on.&&Ooo I hadn't heard that. Do you have any links or anything? That would be amazing.&&Links?&&I honestly feel as though this is the case, and I'm not seeing much difference with the short films coming from Oats.

He's obviously got amazing visual talent and the designs are awesome. But I wish he would inject some better ideas into them. Rakka seemed like your standard alien invasion premise as much as Zygote is your standard science gone wrong, body horror narrative. The only thing that seems like an interesting premise is *Firebase*, but I have no idea how they would even begin to tie *that* into a coherent story.

I really felt the same way about *Chappie*. They could have taken the story in so many different directions, but they chose what is essentially a copy and paste of *Short Circuit (1986)* with a South African hiphop soundtrack. &&*had ;)&&He said in an interview that he might monetize the next episodes, put the first one out for free then make people pay for the second. Which honestly, i wouldnt mind paying to see the rest of Rakka and Firebase&&I think you meant tons and tons.&&/\&&Yeah I wrote up a big thing about it with formatted links and everything, without checking to see if someone already had. I'm glad funhaus is growing so much I have to start checking the comments for them first lol  &&Came here to say that&&Weta Workshop had a Warthog on display when I visited years ago. I got quite excited until I realised it was just for the short. That thing looked so cool!

IIRC it also had a lifelike mannequin of Sam Neill in the driving seat which was very confusing.&&Pussy and forced induction in the same sentence... Hmmm...&&Turbopussies browsing Reddit already have the exact same experience.&&And if we are lucky he will make Over the Top 2&&https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Boogaloo:_The_Wild,_Untold_Story_of_Cannon_Films Yes! Well worth watching, a rollicking reel.&&Or John Waters?  So he's spent millions of dollars doing what poor people have been doing for decades?&&Also known as the Cars 2 and 3 model. &&Similar to Teslas business model. Sell a very expensive luxury model first in order to be able to create a much more affordable model down the line while remaining profitable. &&[deleted]&&I really hope they make Rakka into a full movie. That short film was awesome.&&Out of the three so far I loved Zygote the most.  It actually felt like I was back watching the old Alien movies with the tense chase scenes and vivid gore.&&These shorts were created to see what can get traction. Whatever catches on will end up in a larger production.&&I watched Zygote before bed last night. No lights on, just laying in bed with my iPad. God damnit what a mistake that was. The film is absolutely terrifying. &&Good site to watch all these at?&&Best thing, that I think some people may miss about firebase, is the beginning when the naked snake character is wielding a pointed stick, and that ties in with Kojima's concept of using ropes rather than sticks. &&Firebase is the best one so far. Zygote has awesome monster... but damn... Firebase was badass. It gradually got better and better as it went on. I could easily see it being Blomkamps next great film.&&I was just about to post that, I'll upvote you instead.  This was really interesting, but then it kind of ruined the movies a bit, because I notice all of the things they pointed out about the movies now, lol.&&So he had a job? Wow, i never thought of that since i live off just air.&&When was the last time that happened?&&it had the benifit of needing to look like it was shot on a shitty home video camera and not a 100k+ rig.  natural lighting all outdoors in the woods.  theres a reason it was so cheap&&Seems to me he's being silly. Unless he's against all products?


Now he is exposing the long-term financial health of his company  exclusively to the success or  failure of the next film. Well, Chappie wasn't a big hit.


Development of films is a far larger process than actually filming. If he's creating a film studio that means he's hiring people for his films every time he needs them. Okay well those folks can't wait around till he finally secures financing for the next film and if they instead were working for him inside this very Studio they could be doing the commercial work with his name attached to it so he could charge higher prices and subsidize the costs of the film studio, there by isolating himself from any failures *which are inevitable*.&&Blomkamp thrives off of high production value. $60,000 would be trash CG and bad actors... No thanks I'd like to see his career thrive again.&&I keep waiting :( I think the director said that's a no-go, though&&That's called capitalism.&&And it paid off&&Exactly. Saying ""just do what Blum did"" is like looking at a lottery winner, and saying, do what he did. There are lots of companies in Hollywood that have tried to replicate what Blum does. It's extremely hard.&&They can, and Blomkamp is pretty good at that. His history of short films is evidence of this.&&[deleted]&&I liked Elysium and Chappie. &&Everyone shits on Chapie but I thought it was better than a lot of the other ilk that slinks through movie theaters regularly.&&[deleted]&&I liked Chappie, and Firestorm...&&Let's be honest, this is just sour grapes.

He released a string of med-to-high budget movies, each a critical and box office bomb.  Rather than blame himself he is blaming Hollywood (or, ""the system"").  

Now he has the wholly unoriginal idea of pushing ideas out through social media and places like Reddit and hopes to get some sucker producer to fund the feature film.

Sorry dude. You had your shot. You're not Ridley Scott, you're not even Shayamalan (who at least doubled-down and came back with a quality product). 

People who try to milk the Internet and thousands of indiscriminate fanboys who will sink their time and money into any bullshit endeavor are pathetic.  &&That's a path I hadn't considered but makes perfect sense. They love that type of dark sci fi that's just a little outside the mainstream, but still draws a large audience. Man in the high castle and black mirror&&Netflix and Amazon have their own short film platforms and aren't looking for previously produced projects. I know as I just pitched them both short projects. They are not looking to air previous produced shorts, they are looking to bankroll ideas to produce and own them outright. Oats doesn't fit their model.

If Oats cut a beneficial deal with either, maybe, but as of two weeks ago, they are not planning to air shorts they do not own.&&He doesn't sound like he wants to lose his independence. But I guess a deal with him in full creative control would still be possible. &&Then he won't be producing films using his own money and will be tied in to their demands anyways. Commercial work pays for your personal work. He has assembled a team of people he likes to work with... he needs to be able to pay them, 1 dud and he can no longer pay them and then he's lost them. 


While he's developing projects, his team could be taking commercial work for the company *using his name to charge a premium price and attract bigger clients.*




He's literally exposing himself to any failures by doing this. Now 100% of his expenses will have to be paid by guaranteed hits in an industry that has no guarantees.  Martin Scorsese & Steven Spielberg both put out  commercial dudz this year.   He's  setting himself up for duplicating Francis Ford Coppola's *One From The Heart* disaster.



He's either stubborn or incapable of working on multiple projects at once, *like most good directors* and unwilling to recognize his own weaknesses. If he has a Production Studio and he's not paying for the costs using the easy money of commercial work, he's an idiot. He literally could have his team do 95% of the work on a commercial he shows up for the day of the commercial the company pays him a premium and everybody goes home in a new car.


Now it very well maybe that he just wants to do this for three or four years because he's got so many ideas in his head and needs to concentrate on it and he's got enough financial experts who have structured his company in a way that it's still being paid for by other people, that's fine. But there's nothing wrong with commercial work.  &&There was a limited resurgence of horror anthologies over the past decade. That's the best way to get short films in front of viewers. &&[deleted]&&No one? Volume one has been out less than a month and it has 1.3 million views. Zygote has been out for 20 hours and it's already at 230k views. That's a lot of no-one &&What if they packaged it up as Oats Studio Volume 1 and showed all three shorts, plus the other stuff, as one film? I know I'd pay to go see that on a big screen in a heartbeat.&&The shorts are what they can pay for right now, with backing they can make feature length. &&I wouldn't say that, I could see a deal being struck for a series of short films on Netflix and Amazon. &&No, it's fine, just needs Bitcoin donations without crazy fees and overhead. (Patreon fees, for example)&&I don't think it's his goal. He makes them to show the concept, the script, the technology. A demo reel, per se. &&Call it a miniseries. Boom.
&&What's the premise?&&Neil has to do something about the boring, trope-y dialogue in his movies. This eventually got good, but the first half was just dull, needless exposition.&&I just watched that one, then Rakka (Sigourney Weaver is in Rakka) then Firebase. Watch them all, you won't be disappointed. 

I'm going to throw some genuine American Ds Blomkamp's way via Steam, just to support him in my small way. There is great creativity and liberty in funding this way rather than get constrained by a big studio, IMO.&&Do you know if the assets are rigged for animation?&&Studios spend a lot of money getting pitches and doing screen tests for future projects, this might just be an extension of that. He can get near real-time feedback from audiences about subject matter, what works and what doesn't, etc. Like a bigger focus group.

Except most people don't know what they want :)

But good luck to 'im.&&I do feel that just Steam is very limiting. I've bought every asset so far, because I want the high quality 5.1 versions and I also hope this projects succeeds, but I don't do 3D modeling and stuff like that.&&Independent financing of films has become a lot easier now that the SEC changed it's rules. They could easily raise the capital themselves if there is enough of an online response. &&You can't say they don't look like prawns. That's what they look like, right?  &&Ya.   Sigourney Weaver,  she is so fantastic.&&[deleted]&&I just did and I love it. &&Yeah, that comparison falls flat on its nose. People around here calling this project doomed seriously don't realize how the industry has shifted and allows people to do whatever they want. Still a huge investment, but comparing it even to similar approaches only five years in the past is useless, it's a completely new paradigm. 

By the way, assets like the Rivergod v2 are so worth their money. I'd support it for cheap assets alone, but the whole concept is really neat in general. &&Chappie really was a lot of fun. And got the gears going about good and evil, nature vs nurture, and  things like that. I liked it. Not everything can be a masterpiece. &&I neither know nor care about Die Antwood as a musical group, which seems to be the litmus test for Chappie, but I very much enjoyed watching the movie and have continued to be surprised by the harshness of the reviews it has received. &&Felt like an awesome B movie. Not good, but still fun too watch. Plus i  like Die Antwoord&&I enjoyed it on a visceral level. He can direct SF action as well as absolutely anyone, and I loved Kruger. But the writing was undeniably bad, the main villain was one dimensional and the ending was incredibly cack-handed. What's sad is that a little less social commentary, and a little more political and ethical insight and balance would have made it a far better film.&&It was really mediocre. It's not a horrible film, but it is not on par with District 9. Then Chappie took a fucking nosedive.&&You'd be surprised.  The general consensus on this subreddit seems to be that everything he made after District 9 is trash, but that's really not the case.  It's really hard to live up to D9.  His later movies weren't as good but they were still half decent and a good way to spend 2-3 hours.&&Great world-building, less great-script. I like that most of the Oats projects are just solid worlds at this point. Now he just needs one really awesome script.&&[Don Jon is a production of Hit Record films, yea.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Jon) They went full movie once, and I think he wants (wanted?) to do more. 

What I meant specifically is that Blomkamp is talking about giving young artists a shot, going ""indie"" and working towards producing films without the studio system. Similar aims, but a completely different approach (top down vs bottom up, essentially).&&At the time of don Jon I remember him saying he wanted experience doing a film in the traditional way before doing more hitrecord stuff. 

He may not have meant a feature film in theaters but I thought he had bigger plans tbh. &&> I'm also very septical about this approach

There is a septic tank joke here somewhere...&&Fair enough, I'll probably give it the one off tonight.&&Yknow, you make a good point....&&Gritty Transformers in his style would actually be pretty cool imo. &&Hopefully a Transformer.&&Yes, it is a bit of a stretch, if it was any other project the rumor would be dead. But as I said in another comment, you have to know Kojima and what he is capable of. 

Neill has said in the past that [he likes Kojima](https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/27/15882198/neill-blomkamp-video-games) and video games in general. If Kojima got him on board, it would very likely remain something secret. This is why there is still room to fantasize a little bit especially considering the scale of the Death Stranding project according to Kojima (It has already reached Del Toro, Reedus and Mikkelsen, these are not random people).&&Yeah I'm on phone but I'll give you links ASAP. I edited my original comment /u/FallingToFly &&/\&&Yall&&Yea it seems in the last few months they've really broken into the more mainstream audience away from RT.

Hardly.&&To be honest between production costs and branding that's probably out of necessity as much as it is by choice.&&Tesla sold the roadster first.&&> man i am obsessed with Firebase. It is like a ridiculous mash up between Predator and Metal Gear.

I LOVED the presentation.  I think it was the moment we saw the tanks all floating up in the air that I was hooked.

The others are great too, but Firebase has me chomping at the bit for more!&&I know nothing about firebase... but... that sounds pretty fucking cool...!&&Where can I watch said movie?&&Hearing so many comments about Firebase having Metal Gear vibes is the first thing in all these years that makes me want to check out that series.&&It's very SCP-esque&&I hope they will make all of them into a full movie. Gonna support every one of them. I love Blomkamp's style and ideas.&&Rakkas the best one&&I have to give them props for creating the most horrific monster I've seen in a live action movie.&&I watched it last night, and it ruined monster movies for me. It was just too perfect. The first scene sets up an interesting world and built tension. After that, it was almost 100% scary monster time, which is what a monster movie should be. The final scene has so many layers: it's a callback to two earlier scenes, it makes the human seem monsterous, it develops her character (into a badass), and on top of that it's a special effects masterpiece. This movie did everything right, and did it in less than half an hour.&&I think it's really cool that we've had people latch onto all three of them as favorites!  I think all have more potential than most of what we see in Hollywood. 

And the quality is REALLY impressive.  It's amazing what people who love what they're doing can put together, isn't it?&&I'm pretty sure it's the left overs from his alien film. &&why oh why did i watch this in bed?!

At first it have a very Alien vibe and the scene in the corridor when she shoots at it felt and sounded like something from Aliens.

The monster itself reminded me of something from the Resident Evil games.&&Paranormal Activity, I'd guess? &&[deleted]&&Paranormal Activity

Budget: 15,000 USD, Box office: 193 million USD

But yeah, those are two very similar movies that hit the cultural jackpot and this is not something anyone should consciously aim to do.&&Most paranormal activity movies, especially the first one, have a great profit margin too. Horror movies in general can be made quite cheaply.&&The Purge only had like a 3M budget. I think it made like 80M at the box office. &&Open Water, Sex Lies and Videotape, 84 Charlie MoPic.  But yeah, they are pretty rare.  Looking at you, Death Race 2050.&&Probably My big fat greek wedding.

Budget: $400,000 


Less than a year after its release, it had grossed $44,940,956.&&I liked Chappie. Sure it could have been better, even Blomkamp said so (which he also said about Elysium), but I still found it entertaining and heartfelt.&&I didnt say he should to re-shoot blair witch, all i said was that its possible to do financially succesful film without big budget. I also believe theres many scifi films which are quite good without any use of cg.&&Also, if they hit the lotto chances are the profits go to whoever risked the money for the movie. It's not like the director gets 50% of the cash.&&while it maybe be cheaper than before - it's still expensive and the largest part of a movie budget for films with heavy VFX.&&there was a scene where chappie gets dropped off near the gangsters that beat him up.. chappies fear when his dad left felt so much like getting dropped off to my first day of highschool.  i thought it had a lot of great moments like that&&Your reaction to Chappie probably maps largely onto your reaction to Die Antwoord.&&Just because a film is good, doesn't mean it will make any money. 


Directors specifically set themselves up with their own production companies so they can retain talent for when they need them for their personal projects.  That talent can be making commercials to pay for the cost of running a production company , thereby ensuring that when they do have a hit they can keep more of the money and when they have a failure, the losses are minimized. Have a chain of commercial work already scheduled  insures money keeps coming into the company.
* as a name brand director he can charge a premium and attract better paying clients.* something tells me he can only work on one project at a time and doesn't realize that other directors can multitask, delegate, and keep their talent busy which means they get better at what they do coming up with new ideas that they can apply elsewhere by doing commercial work. 




Besides, everybody knows if you want to produce something especially in the film industry, *you use other people's money*.


Francis Coppola is one of our greatest directors he literally developed the real-time technology that is standard for the company today. He developed this while making One From The Heart, his first big production film under his own name using his own money.


It was a commercial dud & his new film studio collapsed. Suddenly he's doing subpar work for hire, like the  movie *Jack*... and the string of personal films he had made up to that point stopped being possible.&&Biggest issue I had with it was the bit where Die Antwoord, having gone to all the trouble of getting their hands on Chappie, abandon him in the middle of a slum so that he can ""learn how to be a gangster."" I mean, I know they're not meant to be the sharpest tools in the box, but that's just stupid.

Oh, and the schizophrenic tone, where it whipped between kid-friendly ""robot antics"" like Short Circuit 2 and exploding heads like Robocop.&&That's fine, But I watched them and felt it was a missed opportunity to make a truly great film. &&I love those two shows. &&Would you recommend Man in the High Castle?&&Yeah it is alot like black mirror which has a huge following! Even from early on in just the UK there was a massive buzz around it. If oats can ink a deal with a big distributer like Netflix I'm sure these shorts will blow up!&&And Stranger Things!&&No he plans on them buying the rights to have him flesh out the ideas. So if they liked say rakka, they would pay him to make a fully movie.&&Bigger problem is that no one pays to see short films. &&If every two  views amounted to a ten dollars ticket (and it wouldn't ) the movie would still be a drop in the bucket in Hollywood terms. 

That's not a big market you're describing. 

Not to mention there must be random YouTubers with products that cost far fucking less to make getting a million views in a month. &&I think what they mean is that nobody pays money to see them.&&how is that a lot? Wow, a whole fucking million on youtube? In ad revenue (not that it's important to him, but for the scale) it would be just several thousand bucks. And if everyone bought a 10 dollar ticket it would still be a whopping 13mil. &&Even 2 minute vlogs can net a million in an hour&&From what I can tell, basically it's kind of like *Alien* (people trapped in a remote location with a predatory creature), except the monster in this case has the ability to absorb body parts from its victims into itself, including hands so it can activate fingerprint scanners throughout the sci-fi base. The screams it makes are super creepy btw.&&A science experiment gone wrong starts wreaking havoc to a mining base.

Guess I was thinking of Chappie, District 9 and Elysium all taking place there or something. &&Yeah, he should just stop writing these movies himself and direct other peoples scripts.&&Blomkampf is a good example of why I don't every director should be a writer.&&But I loved the movie *Die Antwoord Do A Movie And Also There's A Robot*&&I didn't think I was going to like Chappie. But I did. And the end opens up a whole new dynamic of immortality that could be explored in another movie. &&I think that in hindsight, District 9 isn't quite as amazing as everyone thought initially -- it's primarily the dazzling production design and effects. Blomkamp is a visual director and his commercial roots show.&&It was mediocre and preachy, which you never want to be. 

If you want to have solid themes you need to be good enough that people are excited to have you talk to them about deep issues. &&I just felt like Elysium was derivative (and haven't seen Chappie).

It's fine to make movies that are similar thematically but the fact that none of them lived up to District 9 makes him look like he only has one schtick and he could only do it well once.&&Very neat! I didn't realize that Don Jon was a Hit Record production. 

And yeah, I see what you mean now.&&He'd probably do the original style transformers too.&&/\utumn&&I think the combination of their heavy editing and humor that is less dependent on gaming culture in jokes makes them more accessible than other gaming channels. The mainstream audience is less likely to enjoy hour long videos of people playing the lastest games than fifteen minute videos of people riffing off of goofy shit. I'm a long time RT fan and personally love all their different groups, but it's much easier to get my non-gamer friends and family into Funhaus than some of their other content.&&**BUZZARDS IN THE AIIIIIIR**&&[deleted]&&[Here is what he said today on that very subject. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6n28se/_/dk674yh)&&District 10&&Every day we stray further from god's light. &&2over3top: stallone drift&&MY COCK&&For Disney?

Though some of the extraneous dialogue was poorly written, and the music was annoying, I didn't hate Chappie. I loved District 9 and liked Elysium, especially the robots. He's breathed new life into sci-fi, not doing the same schtick as everyone else.

The shorts have been amazing too. I'd love to see more of Firebase, Rakka, and Zygote. The character dynamic between a leader that has to sacrifice in order to please a psycho whose help they need in Rakka... I want to see it played out. Knowing Blomkamp, that's what the story is really about. His take on the aliens is merely an interesting twist that sets the background.&&The design of the aliens and their technology was what really sold it for me. The way it moves around was really cool. I wasn't expecting that level of production value from a short film on YouTube.&&Rakkas felt too fragmented for me to really get a read on it. More like a overly long trailer. In part, it reminded me a lot of Falling Skies.

Zygote could have been a clip from a movie and a movie I would like to see. The monster looked great.&&Rakka all the way. Zygote gave me nightmares. Jesus. &&All of the monsters in these shorts look fucking great&&Apparently it's now know as Jazz Hands.  &&From my unerstanding the only way to currently support Oats Studios is to buy the from the films on steam. So for any novice filmmaker thats gotta be pretty cool to have these amazing creatures to add into post or whatever.&&AND PEOPLE SAID I WAS STUPID FOR WANTING HIS ALIEN MOVIE MORE THAN RIDLEY SCOTT'S&&So... Like once every ten years. &&Paranormal activity would be roughly $450 000, however Blumhouse's ""The Gallows"" in 2015 would only cost $100 000 with both raking in millions at the Box Office.

As someone pointed out this is the method Blumhouse pursues, low budget blockbuster. Roughly $191 million into production years later and they've made over $2.9 billion in Box Office sales.&&I see that logo in a trailer, and suddenly my ears perk up.&&also [annapurna pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Pictures)&&Thing is, a lot of their films are not that profitable. I mean they are great artistic achievements but a fair share of them are commercial duds. 

The last time you saw a company push for Critical acclaim like they do you had Harvey and Bob Weinstein. Harvey got the Oscars (and spent all the money with Miramax) while Bob got all the money with Dimension. &&They also produce a bunch of amazing documentaries.&&They poured a shitton more into post for that film. &&No the largest part of a movie budget goes to advertisement.&&Wonder how much Chronicle would have cost without the VFX.&&This seems to be a common thread about that movie:  “I didn’t mind Die Antwoord, I thought it was good.” Or “WTF? Why did they put those psychos in a movie?”

For the record I liked Elysium.  It wasn’t awesome and groundbreaking but it hit on my love of 80’s/90’s sci fun action movies.  Business suit bad person, psychopathic henchman, reluctant hero, etc. &&Totally valid. I had no awareness of them prior to the seeing the movie, so to me they weren't really any different than some of [the other weird zany characters](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/09/74/fa/0974fa3ffe78bad7e5becced730cd35c.jpg) you see in off-beat sci-fi movies.
&&The gang was regularly on drugs and therefore judgement was clouded.

The story is and always was about Chappie himself. It's about how he reacts and grows as a new sentient life form in an established world and he's the outsider. He goes from learning language and customs to focusing heavily on keeping himself alive through scientific breakthroughs to understanding morality and the deplorable actions of the selfish humans.

He didn't ask to be made and was then thrust into a world he could not comprehend and his fate was tied to the choices and whims of his creator and adopted family of captors, none of them truly understanding who or what he is. And it is through the abandonment, the nurturing of violence, the deceit, the attempts on his life, the chance for survival, and the loss of loved ones that helps him grow as a sentient life form. Chappie is the only good person in the film as everyone else has their own agenda and it is he who goes above and beyond to protect those closest to him, even when they had betrayed him time and time again. To the end, they use him until he can change the game himself.

That's why Chappie is a good movie. It's not a great movie but it is absolutely worth suffering through Die Antwoord's obnoxious crap to get the story of the Robot with a Soul. One who only wishes for a chance to live.&&Friend took his little kids to see the cool robot movie. He was not amused when mecha Wolverine tore up a guy to pieces. 
His fault for taking kids to a Blomkamp movie before checking. Dude has amazing gore in his movies. &&Yes, as well as Stranger Things going on with the dark sci-fi theme...&&I don't know, I enjoy it to a degree but it can be really slow paced, tbh.&&Worked for Adam Sandler!&&I know that's his plan, but I can tell you Both Netflix and Amazon are BIG on story. Like, obsessed about it. I was asked questions in both pitches that were so in depth I was shocked. I had answers, but was amazed at their depth and perspective.

Right now? In my opinion, Oats' stuff is incredibly weakly written. Amazing spectacles, sure, but the scripts on everything Oats has released thus far have been weak, full of holes and left me wanting. They feel like half written ideas based around a cool image or sequence. That's not enough.

He's gonna have to tighten up the stories if he wants to sell - any studio, let alone Netflix and Amazon. Neil is known for spectacle and is already having a hard time selling his movie pitches / scripts. That's why he started Oats. Badly written shorts that look great won't help in that regard.&&YouTube benefits from serialization in a way that the Oats shorts absolutely cannot. Bizarre that some people think a million views is anywhere near enough to meet the cost of producing content this expensive and time consuming to make.&&For a channel that is only a month old? That's fucking fantastic. It takes a year to get that many views for a normal channel. &&After years and years of cultivating a base&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6212  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/01552)&&I don't think it's an alien. The security guy says that they found some light and it drove his friends insane one of them started surgically started connecting rat brains and stuff. It would explain the body the girl finds.

So I think it's more like Dead Space some alien artifact drove people insane and the monster is a tool for something.&&So like jeepers creepers?&&Also interesting worldbuilding with the humans and ""synthetics"" which they touched upon as androids used to do slave labor and dangerous tasks. The security guy reveals to the protagonist that she wasn't really a synth like she was brainwashed to believe. Instead it was cheaper for the company to kidnap babies and raise them as synths as opposed to purchasing expensive androids. Super interesting concept.&&Wow, thank you!  Definitely going to buy them now :)&&I think he's from Johannesburg originally and likes to bring the culture from his hometown to his projects.&&I dunno, I do think the themes of the film was also a big factor in how much traction it got. It kinda felt like it was the first big scifi in a while to have such a strong social message behind it.

That social message, of course, being that people in slums are eventually going to build a spaceship, go out into space, and at some point come back with a massive army.&&I dunno, there's still a lot of cool elements that still hold up. The characters are pretty fun, namely sharlto but we all know by now he's the best. 

The ending battle with all the cool guns and bloody explosions are still pretty rad and even. Though it's not a super old movie, I think the cgi rivals a lot of mid tier budgeted movies from even today. That's pretty crazy for such a low budget movie like it. &&Thought it was great at the time, think its great now...especially as aesthetically its this ""what could've been"" when considering the Halo movie that never happened, and the Halo 3 shorts that Blomkamp also directed released shortly before this film came out.&&I wasn't really aware of it when it came out so I can't speak to the reaction it got then but I watched it recently and really loved it. Not a masterpiece but I definitely consider it one of the better sci-fi movies I've seen.&&Honesty I only loved the first forty-five minutes of District 9 when it's in the mockumentary style. Once it turns into an actual narrative film it just isn't that interesting to me.&&I guess we reached the pe/\k of this thread?&&Yea I agree. Like they said, they make shows, not just gameplays.&&What is RT short for?&&See that is the kind of impression a film maker is hoping to make, right? But I think creating a sequel cheapens the impact that impression makes because it's no longer left up to the imagination of the viewer. There's already an answer as to what happens afterward in a sequel. Imagining possible outcomes becomes (comparatively) pointless as there is already a canon after story. District 9 is effective on its own because it allows for us to wonder about so many different things, to try to reason out what might happen afterward and to suss out details from the film to understand more. &&Well, Wickers gave them the ability to return to their homeworld after being marooned here for 20 years or so.  So they will be grateful and will be returning to earth to get the rest of their species.  But the earthlings were very hostile to the prawns.  So the earthlings will assume that they are coming back to retaliate.  You will have the Prawn who left in District 9 find Wickers among the chaos.  They will work together to try and resolve the conflict.  It will possibly not work.  Wickers will be given a chance to be returned to a human, but he will reject it and will leave with the rest of the prawns to leave forever as mankind languishes on the earth in their hatred.

Other plot ideas... prawns live for a long time.  So even though it takes 80 years for the prawns to return, Wickers is still alive.  But mankind is embroiled in resource wars as oil runs dry and global warming is out of control.  The prawns return and offer a way to save ourselves and the planet, but the humans are not receptive.  Religious and political dogma gets in the way, we reject their world saving help and the prawns end up leaving take Wickers with them and leave the earth and the earthlings to die of their own ignorance.  So in the end , we doom ourselves to die from our own failures and ignorance rather than accept help and assistance from a foreign race who we deem inferior... regardless of the fact that they have mastered interstellar travel and we have not.&&Speak for yourself&&Look Who's Over The Top Now!&&mmm high coke&&No, not at all.

But I loved all shorts. Even Cooking with Bill, haha. It felt like some shorts from Rick & Morty Live Action movie.&&Most of my gripe with Chappie was the terrible acting of that music band duo. They literally ruined the film single handedly.

I agree. It was a 3.5/5.0 or higher, decent enough. If anything, I think it would have benefited from lessor-known or starting actors. The two famous actors in it only made you focus on their behavior instead of having more of a sense of mystery about where the story might go.&&Elysium was a great movie.  Awesome world building, great villains, good take on future-tech.

I believe it really suffered from people having high expectations for the social commentary aspect of the movie though.  They were somehow expecting something more subtle from a movie about the people rising up against the bourgeoisie.&&I marathoned it after hearing it has an SCP vibe.

I don't understand what you'd want more of from a twenty minute short. I think they are *meant* to tease you and ""leave you wanting"" *more.* I think they are very well written (especially Zygote) to show you a pinch of lore and background.&&Yup, if you want to do well on YT you'd benefit from the system LPers have; lots of videos of gameplay footage in a short time frame over and over.

what does this cost? A computer, screen capture software and a good mike. And time of course. I think some of the gaming guys I watch have the best ratio of actual money put in to actually making something.

It's a great platform for that. Professional shorts? Eh.

I think Blomkamp's problem is even deeper than that; he's looking for a crowdfunding system that's just not there yet imo in terms of shoveling millions of dollars at him repeatedly. He has a staff of fucking 30 people.

A lot of the best crowdfunded programs are things like podcasts  or video essays where you can squeeze out a lot of content (well, relatively a lot) at cheaper prices.

He said he's already spent millions for volume 1. He's essentially selling a more premium product of a few shorts a year. Chapo Trap House is the biggest Patreon I know of with like $.7 million a year and they sell weekly episodes which is a pace he just can't match (and may not even be enough money tbh). Is he going to release a short a month or something Patrons get something out of?

Kickstarter would may  be better for a lump sum but how many times can you go to that well? If I were him I'd befriend some rich guy  like the artists of old.

The movie is very good for a lot of reasons. His other movies feel very compromised in comparison.&&Oh, I agree -- the apartheid metaphor is novel but ultimately not handled in a satisfying way. It's difficult to understand what exactly Blomkamp wanted to say about class and race in South Africa (perhaps because I lack the historical context) because I think he was less interested in that, than the glossy action he clearly finds joy in directing.&&Rooster Teeth, a production company originally known for Red vs Blue that has been expanding pretty rapidly and now has a bunch of different shows and groups under their umbrella, one of which being Funhaus.&&District 9 is one of my favorite movies and I don't think I want him to make another one.

They placed missing posters around events, really played up the drama and the press got interested. &&There are two minute shorts with more story in them. Shelfdog is absolutely right. The biggest problem with Neil's movies, shorts and features, is weak story telling. The concepts are always strong, but he seems to get so wrapped up in the cool sci-fi ideas that he forgets to focus on the human story underneath it all.

Edit: Also I would say ""lore and background"" are not story. They are details that can aid a story, but the story was about two people running from a scary monster. It's inconsistent in it's own reality, like how she dumped two mags from some giant assault rifle into the thing with no effect but a little handgun at the peak moment of terror easily defeated it? Where's the challenge, what happened to the impervious monster? He just wrote the girl out of any danger, and that's where the bad writing can really hamper the emotional impact of the movie.&&Oh yeah, that's what it was. Thanks&&[deleted]&&A really good movie about South Africa is ""Gangster's Paradise: Jerusalema,"" I highly recommend it. 

All the scenes in District 9 of Africans talking about the Prawns in the mockumentary section uses real footage of South Africans complaining about refugees to South Africa from neighboring African countries. There is also a lot of anti-Apartheid commentary in the film, too. For example, Wikus says to the little Prawn, ""You want a sweetie?"" This was common in Apartheid South Africa, white shop owners wouldn't give change back to blacks, they would return change in the form of candy, ""You want a sweetie?"" All you could do was take it because you had no choice. I think Blomkamp combining these different examples of oppression and intolerance is part of the point, that we all have the capacity to be violent or inhumane to an ""other,"" the other in District 9 represented by the Prawn.&&Was hoping that was it, actually. Loved Red vs Blue back in the day. &&I loved chappie but to me that and elysium are examples of cool films that are taking him in the wrong direction.

It's really worth checking out, Glazer is a talented director. &&I remember seeing the trailer for Under the Skin before a feature, and couldn't actually concentrate on the film I'd paid to go see because of it. Then I watched it and was like 'meh' after 20 minutes. &&and nobody spoiled it. granted, this was well before the internet massively took off, but people respected the experience alarmingly well. &&First of all...

>he forgets to focus on the human story underneath it all.

There's an entire subplot where where Dakota Fanning's character, Barkley, learns that she’s actually human, not a robot. Like there's orphans that are auctioned off to companies that are supposed to be using synthetic humans as manual labor. Flesh is cheaper than the robotics, even if they’re organic robotics. I'm confused how someone could think ""not enough story here"" when this is a subplot but whatever.

Secondly...

>like how she dumped two mags from some giant assault rifle into the thing with no effect but a little handgun at the peak moment of terror easily defeated it? 

Explosive shells. It was explained right near the beginning. I will concede, it's a little weak there. But mostly I just can't understand someone who thinks there's bad story telling here. I may be biased as Alien and The Thing are probably like #1 and #2 favorite movies for me so maybe that's it.&&*edit: sorry replying to the person above you

> It's difficult to understand what exactly Blomkamp wanted to say 

I dunno. Im glad he didn't spell it out with a clear meaning. Its a really complicated subject with a deep history. I think he was nodding to it is such a way that was saying these kinds of things are always in danger of happening (aliens or not)- and that at the heart of things like that is an individual dealing with their own problems.

I didnt think it needed more than that really. &&+ Sharlto should have one an Oscar&&They're pretty big now, definitely worth checking out again.&&In case you fell out of the know, RvB is still going strong in its 15th season.&&Horse rental...

But seriously, most if it is salary usually.  You're still paying actors, a DP, camera operator(s), sound people, grips, animal handlers (and someone from aspca to ensure you're not, like, torturing the things), various other assistants, etc at the very least.

And the production quality of that movie is actually pretty surprisingly good - I'd say it's crazy it only took $400k to make that movie compared to what tons of ""medium"" budget movies spend, say, $20M-50M on.&&Don't forget Cast and Crew pay. Then you've got travel, rental gear, accommodations, craft services, etc. &&Its soundtrack has become one of my favorites, especially the Montage song&&I think some people were put off by its weirdness but I think it had a charming weirdness to it. &&Harry Potter fart boat is the pinnacle of XXI century cinema.&&Did you watch the rest? It builds up the tension and reveals more and more of ""the plan""&&You've got me on the Dakota Fanning subplot, that is something that could be really great. I think it was the way it was told in this one that left something to be desired. Maybe if we saw a little of her doing her job and being treated like shit that I would have empathized with her situation a little more? Maybe they did do that though and I forgot, I've only watched it the once.

It just felt like a lot of exposition really fast told in a dull way, than we get to the good stuff.  The dialogue was meh, really jammed with sci-fi buzzwords and plot exposition. I also want to say that I like Neil Blomkamp's work, District 9 is a masterpiece and there were some good parts of Chappie as well. I just think he's hit a bit of a slump when it comes storytelling. If the whole thing was shorter and told in a more condensed but still cinematic way, I think this would be an amazing short.

Also, I'm also a huge Alien and The Thing fan. I find the characters and stories in those movies much easier to empathize with than in this one. The story was there, but I needed a little more to care about Dakota Fanning.

&&Upvoted for the pay of the MOST IMPORTANT people on the set: crew.  Without their skill and hustle, nothing would get done.&&> huge Alien and The Thing fan. I find the characters and stories in those movies much easier to empathize with than in this one. 

Well Zygote was 20 minutes and those movies are 2 hours. You see where I'm coming from with this? If Zygote was 2 hours and had only the story we saw in the twenty minutes (hell even twice the story) I'd agree that it would be terrible. But it was *20 minutes*. You have to pick and choose what you put in that time and I for one thought it was a good balance of plot and horror/suspense. Sure, we didn't get the best idea of who these characters were but I can't say I didn't see their humanity and their lives outside of what's happening. 

BTW always great to chat with another person who appreciates 70's/80's sci-fi horror.&&",2017-07-13 07:27:01

At one point Netflix had a deal with Starz for something around 200 million where they got a giant heap of content through them. When the contract came up for renewal Starz wanted double/triple. Disney movies were previously on Netflix through Starz since they had first run of newly release Disney movies for a while. 

Incidentally the Starz contract was probably awful for Netflix just because of how absolutely half-assed the content they gave them was.

I'm sure there was more, but apparently they were like 80's movie high school enemies.&&That's a good point.  Apparently they ran into each other at a Lakers game and James was pretty cordial and my friend was having none of it.

Who's gonna be Shawn's REALLY straight man now? Gus is only like a semi-straight man, as he often goes right along with Shawn's highjinks.

&&The ironic thing is that after Psych he felt like they toiled away on cable for eight years and did really clever stuff that nobody saw, so he wanted to be on network. 

He got the part in Galavant in a major network, and once again they did really clever stuff that nobody saw.

It's a method acting thing.

One of the reasons Hollywood has such a high divorce rate, especially among actors, is that you spend months at a time in very intimate spaces, and you're playing lovers, wires get crossed, boundaries get blurred, sexual tension explodes, it gets strange for the actors I'm sure. &&She did not hear the ""cut"" on the set and will be surprised that she is married when the show ends?&&Have you heard about Pluto?&&Not Mandy Patinkin?&&I hate dating.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&The series finale teased the existence of Monk but it was just an easter egg.

Shawn jokes with everyone, it's basically his coping mechanism and favorite state of being, and those two are no exception, except for the fact that he has respect for his Dad and the Chief, and practically none for Lassiter. In turn, Lassiter hates Shawn, but doesn't seem to be disrespectful, oddly enough. Maybe I just haven't watched it enough. Shawn, barelyshows hate *(actual hate) towards Lassiter at all. The most I've gotten from Shawn on this is his brief displeasure a few times combines with anger, distaste and a lack of respect. But no real hate. 

At least, I haven't rewatched this in quite a while, so I maybe am off on one or more points. &&oh really? hahaha nice.  What was it?

Especially considering when I met him it was at a Hospital where he was visiting someone close to him.

Kingsman: The Golden Circle | Official Trailer 2 [HD] | 20th Century FOX,30912,6og5w0,https://youtu.be/0fvqnGmr9S8,2532,1500556632.0,,"Third movie will be set in Australia, with Bushman, and star all the Hemsworths&&Good to see more Pedro Pascal!&&I like a trailer that doesn't summarize plot beats. &&I like how Colin Firth is just... there again.&&""Mayonnaise.  Maketh.  The man.""&&This looks absolutely ridiculous and I can't wait for it&&I just want to know where the hell Elton John is in this movie.&&They STILL don't give Pedro Pascal any billing in the trailer despite being a huge part of it.&&Pedro Pascals's scenes better be mind blowing &&Pedro Pascal's electrified lasso cuts people in half. Ok I'm in.&&""It's very American...""

""hehe, Fuck yeah!""&&The Statesman tower in New York is the same building as Stark Tower in the MCU, which are both really the Met Life tower.&&This looks like so much fun&&I like that Statesmen use lasso as their version of Umbrella. Julianne Moore's character described as Martha Stewart on crack and I cannot wait.


I just hope that Roxie (Sophie Cookson) still has prominent role in this one.&&This movie is like if you took Austin Powers, found the middle ground to Roger Moore era Bond, and then made it into a live action anime&&I love how the Kingsman series just accepts that Hollywood action movies are bullshit, and then amps that up to 1000. There's no facade of realism to try and trick the viewer into thinking something is actually plausible. They go balls to the wall, and I can admire that.&&The princess from the first movie is also returning for this one so...&&If all the Statesmen end up being evil I'll be slightly annoyed.  But goddamn does this movie look fun!&&Colin Firth once again shatters my confidence in my sexuality &&When does this movie premiere?&&That bomb disguised as a vial of men's cologne, that laser-lariat, the ninja lasso maneuvers, a razor-brimmed cowboy hat... Yes sir and ma'am, I am prepared for some gloriously orchestrated cheese in my future.&&Red Band Trailer:

https://youtu.be/t5opVWQog2Q&&Fan theory: Jinx from ""Die Another Day"" was so inspired by the invisible car and the Switchblades and all the other crazy technology in that film that she resigned as an NSA agent and became a Q-like professional of her own for Statesman.

All this is just a segue into me saying Halle Berry is adorable in her dorky glasses.&&Looks fun.
  
Have to say the first trailer was a lot better though, the usage of My Way was perfect.&&""The Bitch is Back"" written on the movie theater at 45 seconds. Nice little Elton John reference. &&Oberyn Martell!!! &&Oh man, what an awesome trailer. Hope it's good as the first one, the action looks on point.&&Who are they up against? Who's the bad guy? Who are we doing it versus!?&&I don't give a shit if Colin Firth dies in every movie and comes back like Kenny from South Park... he's the shit! Anyway, I think this looks badass. Can't wait to see it.&&I remember the first one was in theaters at the same time as American Sniper. I really wanted to see AS but my group of friends that I was with insisted on seeing Kingsman. I hadn't even seen a trailer so I couldn't give a fuck less about seeing it, but I relented and watched it. 

Cinematically speaking, one of the best fucking decisions I've ever made. I loved it so much, especially having not been spoiled on any of the plot or jokes from not seeing the trailer.

This time around, I don't care what else is in theaters. This movie looks so god damn good, I'm seeing it on release day, no matter what. &&So... no Roxy?&&I like how the US bar has the exact same layout as the UK pub from the first movie. &&Whoever made this trailer and the last one, give them a raise. Holy hell. &&pedro's charater needs a scene where he crushes someones head. i need this poetic justice. &&So I guess they don't even bother anymore to try and keep Firth a secret. But it looks like a ton of fun. Even though I didn't watch the first one in a cinema I will definetly watch this one.&&Really excited for this, excited to see if they try to top the Church scene from the first movie. Great cast as well!&&I still don't get why Pedro Pascal gets no love, no title card... Especially when he's heavily featured here.&&Man, I love the crystal clear action. Looks like they really upped the choreography from the first one. I can't wait!&&That clunking you hear at the beginning is Mark Millar grinding his teeth so hard, the Foley guys recorded that shit. That said, still going to watch the shit out of this when it drops. The world needs more fun spy movies. &&This is my chick flick come true - Colin Firth, Pedro Pascal, Channing Tatum, *and* Taron Egerton in one film fighting in custom fitted suits. **SPLOOSH!** I don't care how they weave Colin's character coming back, all I care for is that he's back. :D&&Channing Tatum with a southern drawl. Gonna have to bring a towel for the wife to sit on.&&Julianne Moore could destroy the world and I'd STILL be in love with her &&I don't think anything will ever be able to top [The Church Scene](https://vimeo.com/128370652)&&I look at this, want it immensely, and wonder what the hell they were thinking when they took the Bond franchise down the brooding, super-serious path&&So uk is kingsman. Us is statesman. Where do you think part 3 will be based? And what would it be called if an Asian counterpart to kingsman shows up? Japan is easy. they had something like kingsman. Though they worked for the Shogun i think. The shinsengumi ended in 1869. It could be explained they went underground and exist secretly. And since kingsman is over the top and not ashamed about it, ninjas, samurais maybe even battle robots... The sky and getting shinji in the mother fucking robot is the limit.&&Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated &&Kingsman doing gunslingers better than The Dark Tower.&&I'm surprised, when I saw the first trailer I assumed that it would be Kingsmen VS Statesmen. I'm glad they went this route though.&&So it's a battle between British and American stereotypes. I love it.&&I am so glad the Kingsmen picked up where the old Bond movies left off. Spy movies deserve to have gadgets and insane bullshit going on EVERYWHERE. &&Let's all take this moment to realize that Halle Berry is 50 years old.  She's approaching Keanu Reeves' level of non-aging.&&Fucking Pedro Pascal!! He may be my favorite part of this movie already  &&God DAMN!! I'm SUPER excited about this. This trailer looks even better than the trailer for the first movie

I noticed the huge pivot to the American market. Probably realized the US box office gross for the first want anywhere near as a high as it could have been.&&Hot damn this is one well edited trailer. Fucking loving it.&&Comedy and ridiculous, over the top violence. My kind of movie. &&Ok I might actually be sexually excited for this movie. To many yummy men including the dapper Collin Firth. Can't handle it &&...and Huge Jackedman as the villain, code named The Tasmanian Devil.&&Fourth Movie set in Canada, with Mounties, staring all the Ryans. &&I am so down for that.&&Dibs on Ireland, Pintman and all the Gleesons.  With Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell and Pierce Brosnan thrown in for good measure.&&Throw in some Russel Crowe, Hugh Jackman and Margot Robbie and you got a deal. 

Edit: Well Crowe's a kiwi but still could work. &&I wouldn't complain. In fact, I would actively encourage them to do just that.&&Sweden will throw in the Skarsgaardians.&&Their arsenal will consist of boomerangs, didgeridoos, and drop bears. &&He's in so much of the trailer, yet isn't credited... Very weird to me&&he looks like a young Burt Reynolds, 

Bandit remake?&&I don't trust him....he's a narc &&He looks kinda like a Hispanic Justin Timberlake (in the trailer...not really in other media)&&Didn't even realize it was him until I read your comment. Even more excited to see it now.... GET HYPED&&[deleted]&&If you havent seen it yet, watch the netflix show Narcos. Hes amazing in it.&&[deleted]&&You mean like the one for [shape of water](https://youtu.be/XFYWazblaUA) litterally the entire plot is in the trailer &&Does this? Came to the comments section to find out if it gave away too much...&&Hahaha, reminds me of the Ender's Game movie trailer, which includes the climactic twist ending of the book in the actual trailer, lmao. &&I didn't like in the first trailer for it that they revealed Harry was still alive. If they waited until the movie came out, that would be a huge surprise for me.&&Somebody pointed out in a previous Kingsman post that the Statesmen seem to be based out of Kentucky, the same state where his character took out the people in the church. The Statesmen probably picked him up and he's been with them since.&&When he told eggsy that everything on the uniform was bullet proof even the eye glasses. Well Samuel shot him in the eye and left him for dead. Glasses caught enough momentum of the bullet to keep it from penetrating his eye socket and killing him. It's easy&&It's so great because after the first movie everybody was saying if they do a sequel they should just bring Colin Firth back because fuck it who cares. It's just an awesome spy movie.&&He has an eye patch on! &&*Free Bird intensifies*&&Colin, I thought you were dead!

Nope!&&Do you know what that means?!&&Man ass. Maketh. Man.&&No 'the' just 'man'.... 

Mayonnaise; maketh, man &&It's very American &&I didn't need this trailer to convince me to see the movie, but I watched it anyways. Worth it.

The first movie was fun as hell, and this one is promising to follow that nicely. &&This is one of the few, if not the only,  movies where I love the fact that the action is so ridiculously over the top. &&That laser lasso was awesome.i hope there will be sharks with lasers.&&Just saw an interview saying he will play a ""key"" and ""outrageous"" role. Otherwise they are being really secretive about it. &&This is the only ""sign"" of him I saw...did anyone else notice what the marquee in the background said?? http://imgur.com/a/Le5aS&&On the movie Marquee in the background of one of the shots it says ""the bitch is back"" which is an Elton song. So... Bad guy?&&It's very strange to me. Has more time in this trailer than all the side characters, yet no billing. Weird. &&I guess they still don't see him as big enough. Since his latest and most prominent roles have been a side character on GoT (even though with a huge fan base) and a main role in Narcos on Netflix. I really love seing him in stuff but seems like thats not enough for the studio.&&His role looks to be the most prominent of the Statesmen characters, so this really is odd. &&Ikr. I was waiting for his name to show up this time. Disappointed as well :( My man needs more recognition.&&Too soon.&&I'm sure there is gonna be some eye popping special effects&&[Leaked footage of Pascal's big scene](http://i.imgur.com/1PG4GEC.gif)&&I love the fact that they're all just cowboys with fucking cowboy guns and shit.  &&Wait...was that Tanning Chatum or Pedro Pascal?&&Lasso of Truth? More like Lasso of the Red, White, and Blue.

Also a dude is spinning a revolver around WHILE STILL FIRING IT!!! Sign me the fuck up!&&>  electrified ~~lasso~~ skipping rope cuts people in half. Ok I'm in

FTFY&&I was in just because of Channing. The lasso just makes me more excited.&&This movie plays with the American and British tropes so well, it might even eclipse polandball.

I can't wait for the French, German, Russian or Japanese equivalents to the Statesmen and Kingsmen.&&**Comin again to save the motherfuckin day, yeah!**&&I like how the American organisation doesn't care about discretion and is just all out. They have STATESMAN plastered across 5 floors of a skyscraper in New York &&I feel like the ""yeah it is"" was funnier. && [Definitely American](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JnSDo2yA8l4/maxresdefault.jpg)&&So THAT'S who they sold it to in Spiderman Homecoming!&&No amount of fake buildings can make New York any less tired and generic at this point.&&Electrical lasso that cuts people in half won me over.&&It embraces the cheese from the old school Bond in a way that just works for modern audiences.&&She's entirely absent from this trailer, she only made a cursory appearance in the first trailer and I don't think she's with the rest of the cast at SDCC. 

I guess I'll just go ahead and pour one out [for my girl Roxy?](http://i.imgur.com/394Qm3p.gif)&&I remember liking how Roxie and Eggsy remained rivals instead of being shoehorned into a romantic sidestory.  and she shot a dog!&&Its the love child of Crank and Bond. &&I love that so much. I usually end up rolling my eyes at every second scene in action movies, but with kingsman it's just absolutely funny (and looks somewhow actually cool). They're just like ""fuck it our umbrellas are super weapons what you gonna do about it?"" and go the hell nuts with it. &&Before everyone starts circle jerking over the action, I need everyone to STOP RIGHT THERE!   
Yes, the action was so absurd, and so stupid, and so well done, and lots of fun.   
HOWEVER! Films are not *good* and *watchable for 2 hours* simply because of Action! (See....any well made action film ever). They are good and watchable because they have a great story at their heart.  
Say whatever you want about Kingsman, but at it's heart, it had a great story, with characters you actually cared about. Even in the middle of it being so ridiculous and over the top and insane....you connected with the story too. THAT is always the ingredient certain mega-directors miss (\*cough* MichealBay \*cough*).   
   
So ya. This looks fucking great. I can't wait for the absurdity of it. And I can't wait to see Eggy develop as a character too!&&buttsex&&Oh good another super uncomfortable moment.  &&Jeff Bridges is the leader.  I don't think they have much of a choice.&&Calling either them or Colin Firth being evil. Don't know why, I just get a weird vibe. &&Getting that vibe towards the end of the trailer, what were they doing when Jackson was convincing ""not Obama"" to let him kill everybody. &&mark strong here..

am I gay?&&September 22.&&When I read this, I read this as ""When the fuck does this movie premiere?""  It took me a moment before I realized I planted the words ""the fuck"" into your comment myself.  

I guess after watching the trailer that just felt appropriate and I just assumed that's what you said.&&Eau de Patriot!  :)&&All that gets you is a ""Fuck Yeah"" at the end right?&&I'd go so far as to say she's more adorable now in dorky glasses than if she had tried the look back when she was in a Bond flick...idk what's going on here but she's more attractive now than she was...(checks imdb)...holy shit, 15 years ago&&Halle Berry is 50 years old. Vampire? Yeah, I'm going to go with vampire.&&I go back and watch that trailer just for the usage of the song. Perfectly synced and I love it&&r/gayforoberyn&&The gods made him and it delights me. &&Julianne Moore's Poppy. She's like an evil Martha Stewart. &&Julianne Moore is the bad guy. Vaughn has described her as a Martha Stewart Bond villain.&&The guy who sings rocketman. &&You don't shove a musical in someones face, what are you talking about?&&He should die in every movie and come back in the sequel with an eye patch somewhere on his body&&She's gonna go 006&&Don't worry, Roxy was in the first trailer :)&&Firth was spoiled in posters over a year ago&&I love how he becomes himself for a few seconds when his ears begin to ring from the bomb blast.&&Firth kills 48 out of 88 people.

Source: http://moviebodycounts.proboards.com/thread/1959/kingsman-secret-service&&I forgot how few jump cuts were in that scene.  Just such a well done scene.&&Die Another Day was dogshit and Casino Royale is probably the best bond film ever. I think they made a good decision. &&They were thinking about how successful the Bourne movies were.&&It was the Dark Knight effect

edit: Casino Royale was 2006, Dark Knight was 2008, I eat my words.&&I don't think the pivot to the American market had much to do with box-office, the first film did great. Vaughn said he wanted to open up the world and show that many other places have their own Kingsman type agents. America was the logical one for satire. Brits have the suave suited, refined gentlemen, Americans have cowboys. They were just following the cliches that would be fun to subvert and play into.&&Has Hugh ever played a baddie?&&Goddamn this movie is writing itself&&>...and Huge Jackedman as the villain, code named The Tasmanian ~~Devil~~ Tiger.

Because he is only rumored to exist

&&And Bieber as the main bad guy because fuck it why not. Just some kid trying to take over the world through the most dumb way ever. &&Not sure I could sit through an entire movie of gunshots and apologies. &&As long as it doesn't take place in Southern Ontario

90% of the movie would be them waiting in traffic &&Ooooh hockey weapons!  Shoes that turn into razor sharp ice skates! Hockey stick rifles!  Good old fashioned fist fights!  &&RCMP is already a thing. The Canadians would be more like Snowman.&&You are so *down under* for that. 

FTFY&&If that movie comes out I'll go at it awful and very hard. &&And fassbender. You could fit 30 or more pintmen in the film.&&Pintman? Is this the new drunken Marvel hero everyone's talking about&&Cillian Murphy's sat there as the bartender.&& Neeson and the Gleesons, new celebrity band incoming&&Probably smart to include the Countrymen of Scotland with Gerard Butler, Karen Gillan, James McAvoy, Ewan McGregor, and Ian Glen. They can be led by Sean Connery (out of retirement) and fighting a rogue agent played by Mel Gibson.&&Russel Crowe is a Kiwi&&As is Sam Neill...I mean they could be part of the organisation with both sides contiously insisting that they have nothing to do with each other, that the others are total jerks and so on...&&Exactly 

He is the RED VIPER ffs&&It's all about that contract negotiation, and he's probably not as well paid as the others. He should have a stern talking to with his agent if he does have a bigger role than Channing Tatum (if this trailer is indicative) but still doesn't get his name in the trailer.&&I mean, to be fair, I don't think he's a household name yet. Most people know him from GoT but I think a lot of people probably recognize him as ""the guy who played Oberyn"" and not necessarily by his name. Still excited to see him in this movie though. I remember him from when he was on Buffy. &&With AIRBOATS Lana!! 
&&please god no. Hollywood has already skull fucked most of my favorite movies. Im scarred of the day that they think jaws need a remake. &&He looks more like Turd Ferguson to me. &&You can see it in his eyes...oh wait, not anymore.&&Ya he got a hell of a promotion after all his work in Colombia&&I thought it was actually JT at one point in the trailer! Glad someone else was thinking the same thing!&&Not all of America is Texas...&&Mary Poppins is cool though...&&Yeah that could have been cut in half and still would have given away too much, good grief&&I agree that it outlines too much plot, but it's always tricky with movies like that. I feel like if you don't give enough elements of the plot on this, people might assume that it's some kind of horror movie, so it might be better to err on the side of showing too much. &&Is that an Abe Sapien origin story? Holy shit.&&During the trailer it just kept going. I had a moment where I thought ""hu they also already show me that?"". &&>princess without voice

cool, a live action little mermaid?&&The first few seconds of that clip makes me really want a Bioshock movie. Clearly they could pull it off.&&Minimal, I'd say? If you don't know who the villain is yet, and would like a surprise when the movie plops, maybe skip this one. That's really the only bit I got out of it. &&It's kinda hard to miss, though - he's in the credits and is in all the marketing for the movie.  &&That... makes a lot of sense...&&They don't have to be based out of Kentucky, though. It's not as if an organization based out of one state can't move freely through another. &&Old Forester released a Statesman Bourbon at the 2017 Ky Derby.  They said also that the statesman front was a bourbon distillery in Louisville.

 http://whiskyadvocate.com/jeff-bridges-launches-old-forester-statesman/ &&Yeah, but if he wasn't dead, why didn't he help with the final mission? 

Edit: Okay. Got it.&&I dont buy it. There was a distinct spray of blood when he was shot in the head.

Ill just stick with fuck it, who cares, Colin Firth is back.&&Yeah, you're right. With almost any other movie I'd groan at the thought of it. But when he died in Kingsman it was such a bummer, and when the first rumors of him returning came out I immediately went ""wait.. does this mean he's back? FUCK YES!"" I don't give a shit what the reason is, *don't care*. These movies are so outlandish anyway, it would be like Jason Statham dying in Crank and then resurrected for the sequel. I just go ""yeah, I'll buy it"".&&Well you see, it falls into the movie tro~~u~~pe that we don't ""see"" him die.  It's assumed that he's dead because he was shot in the head.  However, he was shot in the head by a man that doesn't normally kill people.  The guy that shot him even asks the hench lady with him ""Is he dead?"" and she responds with ""You shot him in the head,"" assuming that the head shot would be enough to kill him.  So coming back makes perfect sense *and* completes the joke that you should always double tap!  High chance he'll get shot in the head again, twice.&&I don't wanna toot my own horn, but walking out of the first movie, I said with confidence that Firth would be back with an eyepatch and maybe a beard. They showed his death from such an angle that you didn't see any serious blood, or an entry wound. Plus he was shot by Sam Jackson's character who hates blood, and would definitely look away instead of confirming the kill. Plus, Kingsman glasses probably stop bullets. 

Anyway, toot toot.&&And that will be the only visible sign of injury. &&It looks like when he has his glasses on he just has one of his lenses blacked out completely, which is kind of a modern eye patch. &&*IT AIN'T ME! IT AIN'T ME! I AIN'T NO FORTUNATE SON!*&&*no one knows what it means but it's provocative, it gets the people going*&&""The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.""&&Exactly, it's not gonna win any fancy awards but it is damn entertaining and I loved every minute of that movie.&&I think that's because The Kingsman embraces the ridiculousness. Other movies are over the top, but they try to play it serious and they just come off cheesy.&&The only other one for me that had the same affect with over the top is John Wick. Those movies are so brutal you're saying ""holy fuck"" every 10 Minutes.&&Have you seen Shoot em up?&&How do you feel about ""Shoot 'Em Up""?&&Crank 2 and, to a lesser extent, Crank 1 both nailed this&&He was always pretty good with keys.&&He's the mark Hamill in this one I guess?&&He is playing himself&&My (admittedly probably wrong) guess is that in whatever is the epic fight/shoot-em-up scene that homages the first movie, he's somewhere in the long shot playing the piano to one of his classics. Maybe ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting."" a la the ""Free Bird"" sequence.

Again, I am probably wrong but I would love to see that&&Not weird, just had an agent who royally fucked up his contract. Trailer and poster billings are all about star power as well as negotiated acknowledgements. The fact that he has such a big role but no billing means somewhere along the way his agent or he fucked up the contract.

The trailer and poster makers can't just put the names they see fit in, despite the footage they're given predominantly features an actor whose name they're not allowed to display.

Edit: And lol I just realized I responded twice to you on different comments without even noticing! I swear that was a coincidence.&&It's not weird.

People haven't heard of him, that's it.

Firth, Bridges, Tatum, Berry etc are all household names. You put big names to get an audience its that simple. Doesn't matter how much he's in the trailer. If this does well then in his next movie maybe he'll get a name up. 

It's not some fuck up or a slight on him. 99.9% of people do not know who he is. 
It's you guys being weird, do you honestly think he's anywhere near as famous as the rest of the main cast?&&You didn't *see* that coming?&&It kinda makes sense.  The Kingsman are all in impeccably tailored suits with canes and umbrellas and posh accents - what everyone thinks of when they picture a 'proper British person' even though most of them are nothing like that.

So the Statesmen are all cowboys with six shooters and lassos because that's what people think Americans are like.  Relics of a bygone era.&&lmao pascal's 6 shooter sideways..thats something straight outta a john woo movie. &&Yes&&Looked like Pedro, plus he was the one who said it was a lasso.

Jump rope would have been sweet too, just hoping around and whipping people.&&> Also a dude is spinning a revolver around WHILE STILL FIRING IT!!! 

I mean this is gonna be my favorite thing even if its for a brief second. &&whuteva&&Instead of wonder woman, Its wonder tatum
&&I imagine the Japanese have laser samurai swords and a machine gun that fires ninja stars. But even that doesn't sound over the top enough for these movies. Man I can't wait for this one &&Man i'd love another Team America movie.&&Well from the looks of it, Statesmen is also a liquor producer, kind of similar to how the Kingsman is a tailor shop. &&The whole secret spy bit probably isn't public. Just the corporate headquarters of a whiskey producer. &&I mean, i doubt they're declaring to the world that they're a paramilitary intelligence agency.  They have a public front, just like Kingsman.  Kingsman is a tailor shop, Statesman is probably a liquor producer.&&I don't know if it's an intentional reference, but the Statesman building is the same building that they CGI'd the Avengers Tower on to. &&Feeding into the trope was probably intentional in this case though. &&It's a skipping rope dude.&&Not the revolver spinning while firing it at multiple targets mid spin?&&It embraces the cheese as being fun and makes the action badass. This just looks awesome.&&Sadly I think she's killed off in the early Julianna Moore attack at start of trailer. But hell, Firth is back, maybe she survives too for the next film? This isn't the series that cares about a death that much. &&I think she was busy with her Netflix show with Naomi Watts. &&They're not rivals, they're friends&&Bonk.&&Passcode = 2625 = ANAL on a number pad.&&Maybe it will just be him, Michael Caine was the only one who went bad in the first one right?&&I hope it doesn't go that way as it's kind of a tired trope, and kind of already played with in the first movie. &&Taron Egerton just reassures me that I'm gay.&&I'm not sure, Mark. I'll google it. Big fan, btw.&&Thank you&&No, I just ask when is the premiere of the movie&&I missed that, that just makes it so much better.&&And about half a second more visibility of the Amazing Bisected Man.  &&Fuck Yeah&&and an extra second of dude being cut in half.

&&There's also blood effects added in. &&Black don't crack.&&We all love how he uses his spear. &&So, Martha Stewart&&And then we don't see her at all... Like anywhere else... Just gonna start pouring one for Roxy.&&Yeah... She was in the Kingsman mansion which gets ever so slightly blown up. She doesn't even appear in the table shot from this trailer. I'm a bit sad that all signs are pointing to her being killed off early on; guess they needed to raise the stakes somehow further but I was looking forward to a lot more from her. &&Literally the first poster released&&Yes! I didn't notice that until watching just now but you see a little glint of ""What am I doing?"" then his hearing comes back and he's once again effected. Holy shit Matthew Vaughn is a killer director.&&There's a handful of those ""stealth edits"" when someone flies in front of the camera though.&&Casino Royale was great. I also loved Skyfall as well. &&It was cause of Bourne. &&I think serious action movies were just popular in general at the time.  We're starting to see it swing back in the direction of unrealistic campiness like things were in the 80s.  Probably more to do with 911 than anything.&&Yeah normally I'd be more than willing to call a movie out when it's clearly pandering to an audience but this is a very logical progression within the logic of the movie universe. I'm excited for it.&&He was kind of bad in The Prestige. &&He was the bad guy in Chappie.&&He played Blackbeard in [Pan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064/).&&Would be better if Biebs was shown as having the Benjamin Button disease and is actually an old fart all gentleman like to contrast the hippy Sam L Jackson character from the first movie.&&Don't you forget Drake. &&As long as his base is in Stratford, Ontario I'm down lol&&You mean deadpool?&& *shoots*

Three to four minute trailers are getting ridiculous. Catch my attention, don't tell me the entire plot. &&Until the plot started in the trailer I had no idea what the movie was going for, I felt a big horror vibe for most of it&&Once I saw the eggs this is what I thought too!!  Doug Jones is there so must be!!  &&And it also makes sense why eggy was surprised to see him in a high facilitated bunker hidden away in the teaser.

And besides the 200 or so obvious reasons, why *not* Kentucky?&&Because he had a bullet in his eye. I got a splinter in my eye and it hurt for weeks. I couldn't imagine a bullet
&&He still got shot in the eye, he was heavily injured and atleast out of commission for the next 24 hours that comprised the rest of the movie.&&Might have knocked him into a coma and he's been taken care of by the Statesmen.&&Later Resurrection? Eggsy and Merlin weren't aware he was alive in the last trailer.&&Judging by the first trailer I'm going to take a wild guess and say the Statesmen picked him up for massacring that crazy church. &&Just because the glasses are bullet proof, doesn't mean the frames are capable of holding the lense when a bullet hits it at point blank range. Bullet hits glass, glass comes out of frame, glass stops bullet from hitting eye, but the glass still hits that area and fucks him up.&&Suppose it works for Crank too. The resurrection process only works as long as his heart rate is high.&&> when he died in Kingsman it was such a bummer

Yeah, but that was the point! 

It made everything after that matter so much more. It raised the stakes. It would be like if they did a sequel series to Firefly and they brought Wash back just because.....

ok, I'm fine with this. &&in the final frame after he landed, his eyes opened.  So...&&I hope they don't even address it. He just walks in and never explains why.&&I laughed my ass off in Beerfest, when landfill died and all of a sudden his twin brother took his place.

""He told me all about you guys so no need to run me up to speed, oh, and call me landfill""&&It's probably going to be a wound like Carl from The Walking Dead, and just took out his eye and not a straight shot into his brain.

Or, high-tech glasses designed to stop bullets and emit a red blood-like substance to give the impression of a head shot. Either way, don't care. He's back and that's awesome.&&trope.&&""Double tap"" *see John Wick*&&> High chance he'll get shot in the head again, twice.

Only to come back in the 3rd movie and be shot.... ***3 times***&&I have a friend who was shot in the head at point blank range with a 9mm. Granted he is blind in one eye, has to take meds to control his seizures and he often tells me the same story over and over. 

His wife, now ex-wife shot him during an argument. He told her to go ahead, shot him and she did.&&What do you need to see to be convinced someone is dead? I guess decapitation is a hard ""dead"" and we could work back from there&&""Plus, Kingsman glasses probably stop bullets.""

That's exactly what I said to my friend after the movie when we were talking about a possible sequel.  &&Beep beep&&Pretty much because that's where he was shot. &&Maybe he'll be severely retarded.

&&It'll be on HBO soon (if it isn't already), for anyone curious&&https://m.imgur.com/r/195/1gOMM&&Well he has been in many movies/shows as himself but they say it's the first time since 1975 (Tommy, as the Pinball Wizard) that he plays an actual character. &&...or he is not as big a star as the other supporting actors?

""Fuck Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges, I need my guy on the poster""&&I mean, his agent landed him in a blockbuster movie alongside some pretty huge names. That seems like a pretty good move for a guy who's mostly just been in TV shows before now.&&Yeah, that makes sense, I suppose. Really unfortunate. Also really funny about the dual response haha&&> Trailer and poster billings are all about star power

That's it. There's obviously some negotiation involved but the fact is Pedro Pascal is not an A list star. It really has nothing to do with screen-time or how important the character is. 

After this movie we will likely see a lot more of him.&&It was probably difficult to wrap his head around. &&I think the trilogy will round up with the Chinamen who'll do kung fu with guns.&&I like the idea that one of the statesmen is actually from Harlem or something and since being a statesmen has become this archetypal cowboy gentleman- like the evolution of eggsy&&This movie will finally show Hollywood that Channing Tatums can also be protagonists in super hero movies.&&Plus mech suits piloted by teenagers&&Team America 2: 2 Team 2 America&&Bourbon, probably?&&Ya similar to how they have the Kingman tailor shop.

It would just suck because her character was pretty great and (I feel) has a lot of potential&&Uh, friends can be rivals.

Even if they are low on plot you remember the scenes and they have less effect.&&They had my money at Guillermo del Toro. Didn't need any more info than that.&&That's what I thought too, but once we find out that the main character is actually trying to make friends with the creature, we don't need to know much more about the plot.&&Lol, Eggy.&&Kentuckian here. Can confirm we have Statesman HQ based here. It's right next to the Keeneland.&&There is no reason for it to not be in Kentucky, we have a pretty awesome state (politics aside). Plus, we do have a good supply of bourbon and guns.

Whats really cool is that Old Forester released a special Statesman bourbon in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby, and it's going to have a wider release then the movie comes out. It's pretty good stuff.&&A splinter in your eye... Were you sanding your woodwork with your eyebal?&&How in tarnation did you get a splinter in your eye?&&I heard being shot a few feet away with a bullet proof vest on is still going to fuck up your day, if not break a rib or two. I can only imagine the blunt force trauma of having a bullet punch you in the face, even if it doesn't get past the glasses.&&Makes sense. The energy from the bullet alone should be enough to cause a severe concussion, throwing him into a coma. And that's before the fall to the ground, not to mention the whiplash. On top of that, it wasn't that long before he'd already come out of a coma from a huge explosion, so his poor brain and the rest of his body would surely need some time to recover, to be even marginally useful.

And now that the trailer has established that there is an American counterpart to Kingsman, they would surely be on the ground to look out for what happened at that church in South Carolina, finding a wounded colleague. &&I so want a Crank III.&&stop playing with my emotions&&I am a leaf on the wind&&The part where he dies was just a dream sequence. We then are treated to 10 seasons of awesome where it left off. The world rejoices.&&...our poles got dirty?&&I know, I could have been more specific. I meant *any* Crank movie.

It then wouldn't be such a stretch for a character in an over the top action movie to also survive a headshot.&&Harry (Colin Firth) actually states the eyeglasses are bulletproof when he's showing the gear to Eggsy in the first movie.  It's kind of just a random fact when he's describing the gear, but I'm sure it was deliberately put there to leave it open for his return in the sequel.&&tripe

I've definitely caught some wood in my eyes from some of our saws, never had it stick in there, but yeah it totally happens.&&You're supposed to wear goggles when you use a chainsaw to cut wood... do people always do it?
...nah, just squint a little, it'll be fine!&&It likely DID get past the glasses though. I could see the bullet momentum being slowed, but not halted. Probably popped his eye like a grape.

Again.&&They set it up perfectly at the end of two. He always has to be on fire. &&Wash's return was pretty sweet in the finale of season 3.

Imagine ""What did you think this was, a movie?  Getting shot in the head isn't a death sentence."" It almost fits with the aesthetic of the first film.&&When he's shot in the first movie, the sound it makes when the bullet hits his face doesn't really seem... y'know, skull-y.

My guess is that the bullet hit the bulletproof glasses, and the impact was so hard that it knocked him unconscious/destroyed his eye.&&trips&&Your friends are dumb/don't know how movies work.&&This is the remix edition, of the song about pissin'&&Jdhdidjsjd dhd eje Fish filet 🐠🐟🐡&&No one here heard of James Bond?&&Yeah lol; the best part of that is the scene in the club where he's already gone through multiple guys, punches that one guy so he's down on the ground near that column and hurt trying to get back up, all while John unloads and reloads a new clip throughout it, then just shoots him in the face; all while the camera stays stationary pointed at John.

It looks very different than anything I've seen before.&&I can get behind this term.&&Enough with these washed-out superhero movies where everything is brown and grey, comics are a medium of bright and high contrast exciting visuals. Putting a brown filter over the whole movie makes it look like a turd.

Yeah, everything about these images looks like it came off the page of a comic book.&&Keep in mind the EW pictures always seem to have a totally different color balance from the finished film.&&Should be! Guardians 2 was the first Disney film shot on the new [Red Weapon 8k camera system](http://www.red.com/products/weapon-8k) along with Star Wars The Last Jedi.

Jordan&&that is a spot on analogy&&In the comics at least...

> As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special Heart-Shaped Herb which, in addition to his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther God, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.

I don't know if the MCU version will have all the mystical god powers aspect, but at least as of the introduction of Dr Strange the idea of magic has been formally introduced.

JUNKRAT PRIMED AND READY.&&Every time someone begs him to finish the book he adds another 3 months to the wait.&&Well it's also just a rare thing to see in African American focused movies too. Usually the future is seen as non-racial so everything is sorta homogenized like in Star Trek, and most works focused on the near future or modern day take cues from African American culture and not African culture.&&huh! TIL. I love this&&Haated it! &&Two snaps up.&&You forgot all about Doctor Strange huh? &&Dr. Strange most definitely uses magic.&&Marvel wanted it to be as close to realistic as they could. So strange's magic is pulling and harnessing dimensional energy to create what appears to be magic to us regular folk. But legitimately, it's just fucking magic.&&Doctor Strange seemed pretty straight up magic.  Then again, at a certain point, what really is the difference?  Show a microwave to a cave man and prepare to be worshiped. &&In the comics magic is pretty explicitly a thing. The MCU for the most part has tried to blend magic with plausible science (even in Doctor Strange they describe using magic as ""manipulating the source code of the universe"" using energy from other dimensions) but with Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, and Ghost Rider in Agents of SHIELD magic is becoming a bit more ""magical"" in the MCU.&&Scarlet witch is pretty magical...&&Thor is the law of science stating any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic given comic form, in that you're correct. However with Doctor Strange, the Beyonder, Madame Web, Mordo, Dormammu, and a few others, Marvel most definitely has a mystical element. Madame Web is probably the best example, because Peter Parker tries to hold on to that scientific mentality that everything can be explained through science, but could never actually disprove Madame Web's, nor the Beyonder's mystical power&&Case in point: running after Bucky and Cap and keeping up&&I have no background in the comics here, but I'm really looking forward to this. Is he in a similar bracket as Captain America, or closer to Thor, or something else?&&But is this his movie origin?&&...and not so moody.&&I'd describe him as a mix of Batman and  Dr. Doom as head of Latveria. He uses some magic unlike Batman but less than Doom.

edit: He also is willing to be ruthless and kill in the protection of his country, but he's rarely a dick.&&Shikasha! ahhhhh&&I mean, didn't Rocky 3 or 4 have a robot butler subplot? That franchise jumped the shark long before Rocky 5.

Edit: Okay, so I watched it once while I was drunk and focused too much on the robot. It's not a subplot, but it's not the grounded film that the first Rocky was.&&Rocky 5 was Stallone's attempt at Creed. I'm not sure why he didnt' go to Creed right away. He'd still be making these movies... 

Stallone has 100% control over Rocky so it makes sense that he'd centerpoint on Rocky and his (as in Stallone's) physique and fighting ability as opposed to continuing to look inward at Rock's growth. 

IF you replaced Tommy ~~Flannagan~~ Morrison with Creed in Rocky 5. YOU still get a pretty awesome story. (Cut the street fight thing though...)

But Balboa was pretty solid. Although where the heck did he get the money for the restaurant of that size? 

The setup was odd, I mean Foreman did the exact thing in real life and WON the championship.&&Sadly he didn't!

He outsmarted the final big bad. Not snarky ""Aha, I was wearing a mask and snuck in!"" outsmarted or ""I secretly set up a Deus Ex Machina ahead of time!"" outsmarted. He really did something genuinely clever, that represented a logical use of the tools the audience had had presented to us and we understood.

I would physically place him just above Cap, but his scientific mind (8th smartest man in the world) makes him a force to be reckoned with!&&Closer to Cap than Thor.  He's around a 2 tonner in the comics, and similar to Cap, he doesn't get tired nearly as fast as a regular human.  He also has superhuman levels of agility and durability.  In the MCU, he'll probably stack up as right around Cap's level of power.&&He's kind of in the ""Super Soldier"" tier, so Cap is your benchmark, yeah.&&Not Thor level. Pretty sure the only heroes on Thor's level so far are Hulk and Vision (and maybe Scarlet Witch if you consider her offensive powers, although she is obviously weaker defensively).

From what we've seen, he seems to fall between Cap and Iron Man. Strength, speed, etc. might be similar to Cap, but he has the advantage of a full suit of armor, compared to just a shield. But obviously without the flight and ranged weapons of Iron Man.&&He's right in line with Cap and Bucky, both of whom have undergone supersoldier treatments. There are some differences, but they're in the same tier.&&[LOL these two *very* different responses.](http://i.imgur.com/GXBC3wo.png) That said, I agree that in the MCU Panther's power level will be closer to Captain America's, since everyone seems to be underpowered compared to the comics. He'll probably be a little more powerful, though. Can't wait for the movie!&&There's an [article](http://www.cbr.com/black-panther-15-superheroes-he-destroyed/) listing people Black Panther has defeated in combat. Captain America is technically ""enhanced"", by both radiation and drugs, to the peak of genetic potential for the human body. He's fast and agile and strong, but he also heals so quickly that he can't drink himself drunk and is notably resistant to venoms, tear and knockout gas, etc.

Black Panther is a highly trained human with a mystical connection to a Wakandan Panther god that enhances his senses and physical abilities somewhat. He's mostly noted for his speed and agility; he's defeated characters like Spiderman and Beast hand-to-hand. Aside from the vibranium threading in the ceremonial uniform, he has access to Wakanda's highly advanced technical background, but he is NOT by any means a black Batman/Iron Man character. He may fly there in a stealth hovercraft, but he kicks ass with his own two feet.&&Yeah this is certainly his comic book powers but OP was asking what his powers are in the movies and other than him running super fast and having some impressive agility we haven't seen anything showing that he has powers from the Panther God yet. It seems likely that he gets some sort of enhancement/power from being the black panther but i'd be willing to bet that is likely what the movie is about. &&Not gotten into much. 

We see him inherit the kingdom when his father died in Civil War, and it's assumed he's being groomed to be the next king as his father was out of shape and dragging him to international events - plus he had his Panther gear ready to go.

I'd guess he'd undergone the Panther God equivalent of Captain America's treatment already and was now learning more about interacting with the outside world after a lifetime of Wakanda being isolationist.&&And way more murdery. &&Dr Doom needs a mcu movie he is the joker/darth vader/etc of marvel.

Also the one where Rocky defeats communism.&&Even not as a subplot I don't believe the robot is a good example of jumping the shark. If I remember correctly the Robot was there as an example of just how rich and removed Rocky is from his previous life. Creed's death is what brings Rocky back down to the real world which is probably why Rocky removes himself from all his wealth and other distractions when he prepares for his fight with Drago. The Rocky that bought that robot would have had no chance against Drago, and I think they did a good job of illustrating how soft Rocky was getting with all that shit.&&There was no robot ""subplot"". Rocky just bought Paulie a goofy robot toy. &&> IF you replaced Tommy Flannagan with Creed in Rocky 5. YOU still get a pretty awesome story. 

awesome story how to neglect your child.&&What's a jawn&&If you look closely they are all wearing Donovan McNabb jerseys, with a hoagie in one hand and a bag of SEPTA coins in the other, while singing ""Motown Philly"" by Boyz II Men.

It's just the memory of watching that episode for the first time as a kid. My parents were divorcing at the time and that scene had me in tears.&&And as a Black, lifelong comic fan, I am LOVING THIS! I wish we had this kind of production when I was a child. But at least my kids will have it. &&That trailer still gives me fucking goosebumps. RTJ has never been more perfect anywhere else.&&It's not, it's a continuation of what followed from civil war near the end credits.&&""It also represented him overcoming his stated worse fear, failure.""

Wow I never thought of that. When he was a doctor he would pass on some patients so that he could continue his winning streak of not failing but in order to defeat Dormammu he had to fail thousands of times to win. That's really clever storytelling. &&Oh the enemy team has a Widow?

I know I could hard counter her as Winston while also helping to counter the enemy support and dive heroes, but hear me out...

I'm gonna fucking Widow her right back.

And I'm not going to focus on any other enemy hero.

I'm going for psychological defeat, here.

At this point, I don't care if the enemy team continues pushing the payload.

Every time their Widow misses a shot, I'm going call them trash in chat.

If my team begs me to play another hero, I'm going to block them.

Because no one understands how detrimental of a threat it is to me that an enemy player chooses Widow without realizing that I, too, can play the same character with varying degrees of success.

I grew up just hoping that there would be an awesome superhero movie that I could watch other than the Donner Superman movies. I was just hoping for anything.

Its gonna be awesome!&&Its insane that marvel movies have been so consistently good. even at their worst they weren't godawful, they just weren't as good. &&He doesn't make a sound while landing.

&&Knowing comic physics they could even explain it as being essentially weightless and enhancing the user's strength.&&Vision's body is also made out of Vibranium&&Yep! Plus his comics were amazing under Christopher Priest.&&To be fair, Captain America is on the lower tier of actual power. He pushes against the limits of human ability, but that's about it. 

Cap's best attributes are his strong will, dedication, training, leadership, and tactical mind. He's the moral kernel to the Avengers and tends to be their source of inspiration and morale. &&Also his claws in his suit are specifically designed to be able to move between the molecules of any metal and sever their bond, so he can cut virtually any metal known to the Marvel Universe&&Reed Richards, Hank Pym, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner and... three other guys I guess?

But now your kid will grow up with a Black main character in Star Wars. What a time!&&I've got plenty of issues with Marvel movies, but I have to agree. Iron Man 2 had tons of problems but was still a somewhat decent movie. Iron Man 2, Thor 2, Age of Ultron were just average movies, they weren't just plain bad like Suicide Squad for example. &&Coates current run is pretty fantastic right now also.

&&Are there any plans for District 10?&&Regarding Firebase, is there some criteria or threshold that must be met before we get more content from that world? Is more of the story planned to be released?

I need more River God, and I need to know more about the CIA's role!

Also, thank you for making my favorite sci fi movie of all time, District 9.  &&Thank you for making Oats Studio a reality, can't wait to see more from you there. Any plans on something a little darker? Or even something out of your norm?&&No question, Just wanted to say Zygote scared the fuck outta me and I want to thank you for that.&&Are you a Funhaus fan? How did the guys get you on the podcast?&&I've been loving every short from Oats. Are there any plans to release a Blu Ray eventually? &&[deleted]&&How did Ninja and Yolandi end up in Chappie? Any fun on set stories with them?&&Hey Neill, loved District 9 and Elysium, though unfortunately I haven't gotten around to seeing Chappie yet.  

Recently you tweeted about possibly looking into Warhammer 40k. My question is; from what you've seen so far (either from the people replying to your tweet or your own investigations if you've had a chance to look into it), what do you think of the universe?  

Personally, I think you'd be perfectly suited for a project there! &&If money wasn't the main issue, would you want to just keep doing the types of short projects you've done with Oats so far, or do you see those projects more as a starting point that you hope to build upon for something more?&&Any news or possibilities of (returning?) to the Halo franchise in any capacity? 

I believe most everyone thinks you're the guy for the job.&&Hey Neill,

What steps did you take to writing and directing district 9? How difficult was it for you to break into Hollywood with a feature length movie like that?

Thanks!&&Hi Neill, I'm huge fan and I love all your movies and I'm really sad thing didn't work out with Alien. Have you considered using sites like Patreon/Kickstarter to help with the financing of OATS? &&With your affinity for sci-fi blended with social commentary through filmmaking....

Have you considered directing a ***BLACK MIRROR*** episode?

&&Hey Neill, been loving the Oats stuff thus far.  I was wondering about finding funding, I had read you paid for this first round almost by yourself, how exactly will that work to get your costs back?

Was this part because Sony asked you to do this or because you decided to do it?&&Hey Neill, love your work and what you are doing with OATS STUDIOS. The top post on r/movies today says ""[Neil] wants to make features and include young artists."" Are you looking for up and coming directors, writers, producers, VFX artists, etc...?

Cheers from Venezuela&&Hey Neill, just stumbled over the OATS-stuff on YT by accident an hour ago. After watching all the shorts from volume one I subscribed to the channel and liked the facebook page. And then I saw the posting, that you're doing an AMA right now - what a fucking coincedence.

One question though: The ""Cooking with Bill"" stuff - was that just for fun or something you'd actually want to make into something like a mini series of some sort? And did I just imagine the influence from films like ""The Ring"" with all the hair stuff coming out of the blender?&&Hi Neill, I adore your what your doing with Oats Studios. There is a lot of rumors of you possibly working with Hideo Kojima, can give us some clarity. Thanks for your time!&&Does pineapple belong on pizza?&&Good day Mr. Blomkamp, can you recomend me some scifi books?

&&Hey Neill, big fan of District 9. My question to you is how much did you worked on the Halo film before the project fell through? Can you share some interesting tidbits about it?

There's some powerful game mechanics and atmosphere in a being made out of its victims.&&How many volumes are your planning for Oats Studios? If the response is good will you turn any of them into full features?
&&Hi Neil. I'm a big *Halo* fan and loved your work on *Halo: Landfall*. I know you recently talked a lot about *Halo* in your recent interview with Funhaus, and how your plan for the *Halo* movie was to adapt, in part, *The Fall of Reach* (if I remember correctly, at least).

But what if 343/Microsoft told you not to do an adaptation, and wanted you to do an original story in the universe? Do you have any ideas floating around?

Thanks. :)&&What's your favorite non si-fi movie? &&This is the best fucking AMA ever&&I saw a lot of people asking you about Warhammer 40k on twitter and you said you'd need to look it up. Did you check it out? Any thoughts on it? I feel like I see some similarities between your work and that universe in terms of the blending of flesh and technology. &&Hey Neill, I recently saw your interview with Funhaus, which was fantastic, and I wonder if you have looked into a lot of these youtube channels for inspiration/direction of how to distribute online content and to make a profit while doing it? Since what you are doing is quite new and different than regular distribution of film/short film making.&&Hello Neill! I noticed on the Oats site a ""submit an idea"" email link. Does that mean we -- the viewers -- can submit an idea for a future Oats production? And, if so...if the idea was selected to be produced, how would that work?

Your style and previous work would be amazing to experience in some kind of 3D interactive medium.&&Huge fan, own all your movies. What was your inspiration for the latest Oats short, Zygote?

What happened with that because clearly there was supposed to be another part of the story?&&Are there films you would like to make, but have no funds for?&&I remember seeing something from the leaked Sony Pictures emails that detailed what they wanted out of Elysium to give it wider appeal (compared to District 9). Everything on the chart I saw was pretty much what I disliked about Elysium. Would you say that your recent big budget movies have been held back by the what the studio wanted, or do you feel that Elysium (and Chappie, I guess) both ended up close to your initial vision for the films? &&Hey Neill, love your work. Is there one project that you'd love to write and direct that already exists as an original property? For example an adaptation of a book or video game? Also, I've read that Oats Studios is open to pitches, do you just follow through with an email?  I have a pitch idea regarding The Dark Day in New England. The script was my thesis in college. &&I'll ask the only important question here.

Do you prefer waffles or pancakes?&&Hi Neill 

I love D9, Elysium and Chappie and have really been enjoying your work at Oats. I have two questions. 

**1)** What is it about the sci-fi genre that keeps you coming back to it? 

**2)** While the Halo film fell through, in recent years 343 industries has made a few animated films and some online series. Is there any possibility of an Oats produced Halo short film? &&Hey Neill - Fellow South African here - always get a kick out of the little 'south africanisms' you put in your work!
I am also creating a Science Fiction game set in a post apocalyptic Africa. ( We Kickstarted it to the tune of $140 000 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iZu6CDwoO4 )

Are you ever going to expand the Oat Studios concept to allow other directors to submit screenplays/ideas to be made into shorts as well?

Keep up the amazing work. Zygote was beyond insane! &&What's your favourite place to grab a bite in Vancouver?&&Do you think online content is watering down the value of filmmaking? Where do you see the industry headed?&&What's your favorite kitchen appliance?&&Loving your OATS Studio series right now.

Its finally something thats scratching my itch for Sci fi thrillers/creature features/twilight zone style stuff. I hope you continue and hope you could be picked up by HBO to make a Oats style high production twilight zone for hbo. 

Also, what are your thoughts on Warhammer 40K if you've had a chance to read about it?&&First off, what you're doing is amazing.  The Sci/Horror genre was in need of a breath of fresh air and I feel like you're giving this to us in spades with your world development and enriching ideas.  So from a true fan, thank you.

What interest has this sparked from your colleagues interested in the same genre?&&Hi Neill, what are your views on animation and do you have an interest in developing films in this medium at some point? 

Also, what's your favourite animated film?
Cheers!&&PLEASE tell me that some of those short films on YouTube you put out will be expanded into either full feature films or atleast a Netflix series?

I loved Rakka so much, I don't think there's been such a brilliant portrayal of despair and hopelessness in the wake of an Alien invasion by beings we have no hope of understanding let alone fighting.

So yeah, Rakka series or film pls.&&I ask that you never stop making epic alien movies. That is all. District 9 blew my freaking mind and the new OATS stuff with the [lizard things](#spoiler) just looks fantastically dark. I also just read that you are looking to support new artists from your independently run company, so that sounds awesome as well. &&so i knew i would get asked about this. i have answered it in press as honestly as i can. I will try and clear it up. The film is basically dead. No signs of life. I wish I could have made the film with Sigourney. It does not appear to be happening, or will ever happen. &&ok, so with district 10 the basic answer is yes. I want to go back to that world and tell rest of the story with wikus and christopher. the issue right now is that I have many other projects and ideas that I also want to work on and complete..... and most importantly, the exact right REASON to make district 10 needs be very clear. the first film was based so explicitly on real themes and topics from south africa that effected me greatly growing up there, that we need to make sure the next film does not forget that.&&How 'bout district 9 3/4. I'll bet you could get Daniel Radcliffe!&&pls&&this is a financial thing. do i want to make more firebase? absolutely. but i need to fund it. which is part of the bigger oats conundrum. Once funded, yes i will show more of that world. &&YES!!! this is the point of oats, if we figure out volume 2, 3, 4, etc there are many genre's i want to get into. right now i feel like doing a dark FANTASY as a piece in volume 2 &&""Something a little darker"" Jesus man! The last few didn't scratch that itch! 


Although I am interested to see how much darker they can get.&&Darker than vol1? I can't even imagine what that would be.&&ha. thanks. i love ""jazz hands"" hes a cool creature &&the most memorable creature design in a movie I've seen in ages. creature design has gotten so unmemorable and bland, Zygote is the first time a movie creature has gotten a reaction out of me no joke in like a decade. &&I am. Through my dysfunction cousin Steven. He knows Elyse. I would do more stuff with them. They should come through OATS or something. &&Wait, what!? Neill Blomkamp was on Funhaus? Which episode!? 

I've been busy and glossing over the podcasts lately. &&so originally we had never planned this because the whole idea was so internet based. But so many people have now asked about this- and i think its such a cool idea that yes - OATS will do this. it will be in our store soon. &&we will very clearly open up a CROWDFUND for our first oats project soon. Hopefully it will be successful, the whole project is a giant experiment. If people fund us we will make cool stuff. If people don't, the dumpster fire of money will turn to embers and we will shut the doors. &&Well, actually it was far beyond them ending up in the film. the movie was kind of built around them from the start. On one hand I had this idea for a robot becoming sentient, (not really about AI, more about the birth of a soul applicable to humans, to animals to anything, just happened to be a robot) and asking or presenting this massive question about what it means to be sentient, to address qualia and instead of presenting this overly seriously - wrapping it up in a crazy pop culture medley of insanity, would thematically attempt to be the joke itself. that life is inexplicable, its a huge farce. - that was mixed with me being a huge fan of die antwoord in general and feeling like they would bring a level of craziness and fun and pop culture to the film in a way that would really hit home this core theme. - now to me i feel like i got that right. i know many people reject the film and it does not resonate with them. which i get. &&I have not yet looked into it. I just noticed a disproportionate amount of people asking me about it,  i know nothing about the story.  &&Oh god (Emperor), that'd be amazing.

His visual style is perfect for the universe, but I'm not sure how much you could make the 40k universe have mass appeal, unfortunately.&&OMG, Neill directing a Warhammer 40K movie?!  [Mind blown](http://media.riffsy.com/images/ca3373958e4f097bd08b628932da9775/tenor.gif).  My god that would be epic.&&TIL Neill Blomkamp made 3 of my favorite movies (I knew he did District 9, didn't know about the other two).

I thought Shartlo Copley was the only common denominator all this time and he had a knack for picking good films,  I guess Neill has a knack for making good movies featuring Shartlo.&&It's both. full scale FEATURE FILMS done inside this building (which used to be a kitchen supply store) is the goal without question. Crowd funded, directly with the audience making large scale films for them. - but the smaller pieces like OATS has released so far are an amazing way to be creative and always be working. attempting things, - genuinely seeing if things don't work, seeing what does work. Like each volume is an album and these are tracks. I want both going forward. The other thing with full scale films, if pre-funded let us take whatever risk we want because they are not going to lose money. &&I love HALO. still. But i seem to have a bad track record of turning existing franchises into films. haha, Do i love the world? master chief? reach, the colonies, the flood, the covenant? YES. Am i going to end up directing a piece in that world? probably not- meaning no one is asking me.... Although, I must say if Microsoft asked me to do another batch of pieces like LANDFALL now, i would say yes. Inside OATS that could be very cool actually. &&The Landfall short he directed (?) for Halo 3's marketing was incredible. If I could get a full length Halo movie like that, the nerd in me could die happy.&&Neill's name comes up on a daily basis on r/Halo. With the Spielberg TV show looking like it's in development hell, I'd love to see Neill have another shot at it without Fox destroying the project.&&This is the question I was going to ask as well&&Now this is a question I want answering!&&If offered to him, yes.

[I really recommend watching this video in whole.](https://youtu.be/2YpX6MumIr8?t=17m4s)&&also Neil, why do you think videogame adaptations almost never work?&&it was very difficult, but it was also pure luck. If I had not been hired to do HALO, I would not have met and been  supported by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, i don't really know what the outcome for me would have been. I really cannot say enough how much of a paradigm shift that was for me. once halo went down they essentially made district 9 happen. I had ALIVE IN JOBURG as a short film i had made as a pure passion project,  they looked at that and said why not turn that into a film. and they had the power to snowball hollywood interest in it, &&thanks. we have considered this. Patreon just doesn't work for what we are doing, but crowdfunding for specific projects is definitely on the table. &&That is an interesting idea. I liked that series. I also like directors guest directing episodes of other peoples stuff. - One interesting thing to note is there is a currently not yet released oats piece that was shot in a very particular building in cape town. I thought we had found the best location ever - then i watched black mirror and its the old age care facility in san junipero. sometimes that happens. &&ha, well i'm not sure we will be getting costs back! this question is basically the core of our conundrum inside oats. Our basic goal is very simple. we want to make films with complete creative freedom directly for the audience where we love what we are doing, and we hope they really like what they are watching. now if we take money from anyone other than the audience, we are no longer working for the audience, so that means we need to figure out how to get money directly from the audience to stay doing this. one way would be ""attempt"" to crowd fund oats studios first feature film that is then sold traditionally (except to the people who funded it) and those proceeds then pay for another round of experiments (volume 2). OR we attempt to just crowd fund volume 2 itself. that seems even harder. - now in-terms of other directors or studios following us, - not if we crash and burn!!! But even if we do this has been a pretty awesome ride. &&cool, get some sleep. &&DUDE WAKE UP NEILL BLOMKAMP REPLIED TO YOU&&actually probably not. 1- 3 sets up the vampire love story, and 4 onwards kind of explains the world more, so no i wouldn't just watch 9. &&I thought the same thing with 101 Dalmatians. You should be ok.&&> I haven't seen Districts 1-8, will I still understand District 9 if I watch it now?

All you need to know is that there can only be ONE Jan Michael Vincent per District.&&> I haven't seen Districts 1-8, will I still understand District 9 if I watch it now?

it helps a lot if you at least know the story of District 6.
&&This is why I refuse to watch POMPEII. I think I'd be lost until I see the original POMPE, which I can't find anywhere for some reason...&&probably CS:GO. love that &&haha, interesting question. So the ps4 thing is all me. i think when the US state dept put a hold on high end microprocessors going to what they consider enemy states, countries like iraq were then actually daisy chaining systems together with consumer tech like playstations. this is a viable way to get computational power. so that was me, the sony branding stuff didn't stop it obviously.  &&so this question is a good place to try and iron out some of the thinking behind OATS and where we want it to go. the first thing to say is that we are not 100% up on our feet with a business model that is stable, we inside the company are figuring out the best way forward, and in that state we certainly cannot fund other peoples scripts and ideas. A better way to think of what oats is trying to do is this: instead of locking up our ideas and films and threatening people online who make short films based on our stuff, we want to do the opposite, if we owned spiderman we would make all the  assets to do with spiderman available so the online community who is interested could do whatever they want. make films, do animation, use the score to remix their own score, make collectibles, make t shirts, whatever they are inspired to do. If however someone has a commercial idea, selling thousands of shirts, or making a real fps shooter out of zygote then we can talk about licensing that. separate from that if an artist submitted a design for something inside one of the worlds we have created and we love it, we can see about incorporating it into future pieces we make. same goes for almost any department, BUT that is very different from accepting other peoples original ideas. those original ideas are more for traditional studios. &&Also, are you planning on training within? Will there be options for internships or entry positions to learn from the people we are inspired by? If so, how would we apply?&&Seconding this. I'm going to college to learn how to properly do VFX, so this would be awesome.&&personally not into it. But - chris nolan's batman series is transcendent art in my opinion. also really dig blade from norrington. but generally nah. not my thing &&this is awesome. can i make both? I would probably opt for the musical if i HAD to pick one. &&Anna Kendrick is already an action star. &&Have you seen the trailer for PP3 (heh, PP)? It has explosions and shit. It's already there.&&We clearly need an action musical pitting the expendables vs the bellas&&i do. i wrestled with that. same goes for something like FIREBASE. 45 thousand americans died in the Vietnam war. and countless more vietnamese. Is making a fictional film in that setting ethically correct? Things like this bother me greatly. But that film is meant in someway to convey the cruelty and madness of war. &&They were all trying to kill him. He didn't go out of his way to hunt down and kill people. Pretty much ever moment he uses a weapon on the MNU guys is because they have him backed into a corner. They put their own lives at risk by shooting to kill.  &&Yes. but not as much as i want to. I love FPS games, loved the new DOOM, playerunknowns battlegrounds, cs:go, titanfall, GTA, older games that got me into graphics like MYST, 2007 CRYSIS (because of the engine) - all of valve's games. Half-life 2 probably my favourite of all time. &&negative. i think because i have a particular visual style people think the films are tied together and actually read them as being more similar than they are. District 9 is EXTREMELY south african and an allegory for apartheid and race in SA. Elysium is about immigration, refugees and class warfare, etc.  - chappie is the least connected. its about the birth of a soul, about the farcical random nature of life, about nature vs nurture,  &&While we're at it, is there a connection with Chappie as well?&&Deafening silence.&&He replied to pretty much every comment except this one...&&Gotta hear the response for this....as a huge alien franchise fan and just watched Covenant for the 2nd time, goddamn is it a let down. The CGI dominant creatures is what mostly ruined it for me. I NEED the Alien 5 Neil was supposed to more then ever now.

IMO It seems Ridley has just lost his way with this franchise and doesn't know wtf kind of movie he actually wants to make, so he rolls 3-4 different plots and ideas into 2 hours making it a jumbled mess. Sucks&&elysium for sure. on the ring. no question.  && yeah. I want to . would be cool. those guys are MASSSSIVE fans of chappie. so its cool to just connect and talk about stuff we both like. &&It's kinda Niel's style to show us the action and world of the movie through different lenses, literally. Taking different perspective on a setpiece or world can give the movie gravity and help to suspend disbelief. It's a style choice. He set up the world of D9 with the documentary style, then gradually transitioned from showing us this world through a human perspective like interviews and documentary stuff, to the real conflict and struggle of the characters from the outside perspective of a 3rd person viewer. We're not omniscient. We don't know Koobus's or Chrisopher's or Wikus's exact thoughts. We can only infer. But notice how at the close of the movie it goes back to the documentary style, grounding us back to the human perspective. The documentary style is there to make us feel immersed into the world before we care about what's happening to our protagonists. &&so the thing with the cooking show is that we just want to make weird small pieces along with the bigger more serious ones. ""I"" find the cooking show funny, i am aware that many people might not. but if we figure out cash going forward and we make more volumes there will always be weird pieces like that. we have too many to make. - side note, ALEC GILLIS who owns amalgamated dynamics (they did practical fx work on starship troopers, alien 3 etc) is BILL. i sent the designs of the props we needed to amalgamated dynamics to get them to build them for us, and he asked if he could play bill. haha, and he's really good. He is also in a series we made called BAD PRESIDENT that we might not release. it was made pre trump, and i think people will assume its a comment on trump and that we missed the mark. (or pres is more of a frat boy) those insane presidential vehicles we did (plane and car) were from BP &&Thank you. I love OATS. - the first time I met HIDEO was at E3 last month. Prior to that I actually sent him the oats pieces online to see what he thought. He was very knowledgable and cool with insight into where he thinks hollywood (2d narrative ""film"") is going as a medium and pretty much summed up how i and oats think its going. - outside of that, No. Not working on anything with him or kojima productions. But i must say I am real fan of his, both as a person and his work. -  &&fuck yes&&Some perspective: we don't find it weird in south Africa as far as I know.

We honestly don't. Everyone I know LOVES Hawaiian.&&The single biggest recommendation i can possibly fathom is for a book that comes out early next year called THE GONE WORLD by Tom Sweterlitsch. It is probably my favourite book of all time, and for sure fav sci-fi. I know obviously it's a personal subjective thing but i found it profoundly moving. &&I can answer this: *a lot.*&&I really cannot say this enough. The WHOLE point of oats is to hopefully have things like this happen. every single thing we have made is up for free usage by artists, for the sake of art, and anything we have made is up for licensing by anyone who has a commercial idea. Licence ZYGOTE for a game?! HELL YES. all day long. We will hand over all assets, extra stuff we wrote, all artwork, anything that leads to more creativity&&as many as we can fund - indefinite amount. If it seems like people want to watch features out of a few of the ideas, that is our goal. we would love to make them. &&too many to list. Off the top of my head, -there will be blood - dr strangelove - boogie nights - goodfellas - city of god &&I think it's because the answers look like they came from a real person and not a 5 person PR team with creatively positive sentences&&He answerd it somewhere else in the thread. He did not yet check it out.&&yes, we at oats have absolutely looked at and referenced this. The way I think of it is that ""FILM STUDIOS"" existed in 1950, youtubers did not, will versions of youtube personalities/ shows exist in 2050? yes. Will traditional ""film studios""??? hmmmm&&I would have to say that james cameron is probably my favourite filmmaker. films like terminator and aliens. Ridley scott's ALIEN was clearly a massive influence. (ridley as well as a general inspiration, films like black hawk down) there are tons of other inspirations people might not immediately assume this but MONTY PYTHON is like top 3. (i think pieces like GOD with sharlto start getting closer to this side of my personality). As I got older Kubrick is a really big inspiration. Luc besson, chris cunningham. Films like there will be blood, and punch drunk love. - a ton of sci fi in visual or written form. Joe halderman, asimov, images from people like ron cobb to frank frazetta and boris vallejo. (really into fantasy) &&so right now at oats we are working on a 12 minute ""film"" that is done entirely within UNITY as a real time renderer. We are essentially doing a cinematic film in a very high end video game engine. this will be rendered out in traditional youtube film fashion, and views will watch like normal. - BUT because its ENTIRELY real time, like a game cinematic we have the ability to place a viewer IN the film with vive, or vr headset and experience it in true real immersive 3d. (not 360 deg global camera, with footage mapped onto the inside of a sphere, which makes me want to kill myself. ) &&Aye. See Neil's response re: District 10

By any chance could you go into a little more detail as to how/why the project got canned?&&It's truly a fucking shame too, because it was YOUR concept art that drummed up interest back into the franchise after Prometheus disappointed everyone.

I saw the concept art that was released for that flick and was really excited at the prospects of a blomkamp alien movie. It seemed like a great marriage between an established franchise and a directorial style that fit eachother perfectly for continuing it. I got faith in you though bro, to me you're like the spiritual successor of a director like veerhoven and Ridley scott, I grew up on movies like RoboCop and total recall and starship troopers and alien and blade runner, with the dirty fucked up retrofuturistic settings and the head exploding and you're the first guy I've seen to bring any of those kinds of crazy movies back to the mainstream, and it took me right back to seeing movies like RoboCop for the first time and being amazed by the effects and the violence and the dirtiness of it all, it makes it seem so much more real to me than the glossy flawless types of sci-fi you see. so good on you mate, and I look forward to your next stuff. The shorts oats have done so far have also hit those same marks for me and I thoroughly enjoyed them, so thank you mate, doing it how you wanna do it the way you wanna do it and taking full control over your own studio is definitely the right direction you should take imo, so best of luck to you.&&It's a rock. No indigenous life.&&Having heard of your vision for your take on it, this saddens me greatly.&&This makes me want to watch District 9 again.

I adore the amalgamation creature, the geode found in the mine driving people mad, controlling them with its light, corporate Synthetics, and even children being used as slave labor, WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING THEY ARE SLAVES!

Now I'm also a huge Die Antwoord fan and am seeing them in August.

Also, the OATS studios films you've been putting together have been amazing, keep up the fantastic work.&&Not sure how much you care about individual reviews, but my absolute favorite reviewer, Vince Mancini at FilmDrunk pretty much [exactly nailed what you've said here about Chappie](http://uproxx.com/movies/chappie-is-preposterous-hilarious-and-just-when-you-least-expect-it-thoughtful/).  I thought the movie was hilariously irreverent and heartwarming at the same time, which is no easy task.  Thanks for being a weirdo and taking chances.&&Ninja and Yolandi we're so vital to my enjoyment of that film.

""You got to be cool, Chappie.""&&[deleted]&&I like Chappie.  My theory on why it didn't resonate with audiences is because audiences expect a main character or main characters they can either relate to or idolize in some way.  The issue with Chappie is that the main characters aren't that relate-able and they aren't the type of people to idolize.  They are all extremely flawed people and don't have much in terms of redeemable qualities.

So with Chappie, I think it's a good story and a good film from film making standpoint, but for audiences that expect a hero in every story, Chappie disappoints because their aren't any true hero archetypes in the film.&&Sat what you want, but I have simply fell in love with the movie. I have convinced many of my friends to watch it, after initially rejecting because of stuff they had read online. I have not had a single person hate it. In fact, everyone that sits down to it loves it &&Chappie is in my top 3 favourite movies, I feel like the people who didn't enjoy it were probably unfamiliar with Die Antwoord and maybe thought they were overdoing it? 

Of course for fans of both Die Antwoord and your films like me it was a dream come true and Chappie is quoted in my house often :)&&Just imagine a universe where the ""good"" faction relies on brainwashing, propaganda, secret police, bombing planets, and sending millions of soldiers to their deaths just to survive in a galaxy where all the other races are doing even worse things out of spite or just for fun. 

>*To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.*&&Pay a visit to the warhammer 40k lexicanum and our very own /r/40klore.

&&Fair enough. Honestly, there's a *lot* to it, but the (very) basic story is this:  

The Emperor of Mankind (along with his 20 sons, the primarchs, and their Legions of space marines, basically genetically enhanced superhumans) has launched humanity into a golden age of galactic conquest. He decides to withdraw to Earth to work on a secret project while leaving his favorite son Horus to oversee the Great Crusade (the aforementioned conquest). Horus ends up turning to Chaos (the corrupting evil force in this universe, to put it simply) and brings 8 other legions to his side.  
This leads us to the Horus Heresy; the end result being Horus absolutely obliterated and the Emperor mortally wounded and interred upon a life-support device (the Golden Throne).  
For the next 10,000 years (the 31st millenium to the 41st), humanity basically stagnates (technologically), and is at constant war with the forces of Chaos, various alien species (Orks, T'au, Eldar, etc.) all across the galaxy, with the arguably biggest threats being Chaos, and a race of aliens called the Tyranids (imagine xenomorphs from Alien mixed with Starcraft's zerg).  

Of course, that's a sparknotes version. There's a ton of detail that gets covered in books, games, and whatnot. If you ever do want to look into it in more detail, [this](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page) is a good site to do so!&&It's a very large universe of hundreds of different tales and sagas. There are big events that happen that can have big effects on the universe as a whole, or small events that barely effect a planet.

It's a truly grand and diverse world that has room for original tales and retelling of past events (big or small).&&It's basically the Dark Ages in space.

Imagine the fall of the Western Roman Empire if it were an intergalactic civilization and took place over the course of 10,000 years.

A religious theocracy takes control and the sole focus of the fractured remains of the Empire is the production of weapons to defend its crumbling borders and fight Crusades against aliens and heretics.

Culture and scientific progress have stagnated and regressed. Most of the technology is thousands of years old and the secrets of its production are lost. The manuals for the creation and maintenance of weapons and spacecraft are so old and misunderstood that they have become holy books. The mechanics and engineers are literally heretic priests of a machine cult that are only tolerated because they are necessary. They are so extreme that they strive to replace as much of their bodies as possible with machines so they can be closer to their god.

The iconic 'Space Marines' are basically the knights of the Empire. They are insane, genetically engineered warrior monks that are like 10 feet tall and so big that they have an extra heart to pump blood through their body. They also have multiple stomachs so they can digest foods from different planets and other crazy shit. The process of their genetic enhancement is so dangerous that like 99% of the candidates die. They are so rare that many people in the Empire either don't believe they exist or have no knowledge of them. But when they do show up, you know shit's about to get real.

Anyway, it's a really dark, violent, fucked up world. You'd think with all the external threats, humanity would be focused on uniting to save itself - but in reality, all the different religious factions are just as likely to go on a witch hunt and destroy dozens of their own planets for 'heresy', or fight each other over a stupid difference in interpretation of religious dogma. The galaxy has been at perpetual war for so long that no one really gives a shit about why they are fighting anymore, so long as it's righteous and they get to kill shit.

ONE OF US ONE OF US&&If Halo is definitely dead, please take a look at Titanfall. I think your visual style would be great for that.&&Man, have a chat with PLAYERUNKNOWN... Been too long since we had a proper battle royale movie&&> Half-life 2 probably my favourite of all time. 

I definitely got an inkling of Half-Life 2 vibes from RAKKA.&&Awesome! FPS is my default genre too. Do you think video game based movies can work in the Oates Studio model? Dedicated playerbase dying for official, well produced content. I guess the problem is securing the rights, which was a disaster on Halo. &&So Niell if you liked DOOM, have you considered hiring Mick Gordon to do some work for OATS or your studio movies? It's my opinion that his music compositions made the new DOOM so memorable. &&I just have to say that I absolutely love your visual style. &&Let's pretend he's screaming. In space. So no one can hear him.&&Scott needed the balls to stick with his own ideas and should have made Prometheus 2. The audience doesn't know what they want until they see it. There were tendrils of brilliance in Covenant in certain scenes and set design, but they were embedded in a clusterfuck of a story.

Most conflicted I've felt about a movie in years, but at least it isn't Resurrection.&&I'm a big Alien franchise fan too (I saw ""Aliens"" 15 times in the theater during its initial run) but I have sort of concluded that the idea has run its course at this point. The aliens are no longer a mysterious force of nature, just hostile and dangerous animals.

The writing was on the wall after the third movie: its creature was no more of a threat than the one in ""Alien,"" and aside from the reveal that the alien takes on properties of its host, which turned out to be basically just cosmetic, there wasn't much new lore there.

""Prometheus"" had exactly the right idea to revitalize the series: expand the xenomorph family tree by a lot such that you can no longer assume you know what you're dealing with. Too bad the execution was so deeply flawed.&&What really bugs me about Covenant, is the characters lack of logic.  
I understand the new captain is supposed to be commanding more on faith, than on logic, but still. How did no one suggest wearing space suits while on a new world, with possibly unknown species and diseases!  

Maybe his logic is that most habitable planets are just fairly safe, but still, come on! I think I'm more annoyed with the characters than Ridley.  

I really look forward to the directors cuts, and commentary to hear more of his thoughts behind such choices.&&Of all the guns you've designed, which would you most like to have a real-deal functional version of?

Hopefully if you do more people will be willing to go on RLM (besides Max Landis).&&The *Cooking With Bill* shorts manage to be hilarious and horrifying in just the right amounts. I laughed my ass off when I realized there wasn't even any zucchini added to the PrestoVeg.&&I was wondering what the ten second crazy vehicle
Videos were. That's quite cool. I hope you end up releasing the full things.&&You could release them as part of a behind the scenes video or something... and actually state why you don't want to release Bad President because of Trump but that some cool work went into it. I'm sure Oats fans would love to do something with those vehicles. Have them jump through the multiverse into the Firebase universe, and go up against River God and those Russian vehicles.  &&i-it's just a ruse right guys??

Thank you Neill, wish you success with Oats!&&The truth is revealed&&r/knightsofpineapple welcomes you, brother.&&You're my goddamn hero.&&Have you tried jalapenos and pineapple?

 &&You might also like The Forever War by Joe Haldeman.&&Ya, they already had a lot of the props and shit made for it so when it fell through, a lot ended up being used in District 9. Like most of the weapons and vehicles were somehow repurposed for District. If you look, I'm pretty sure the Warthog they made even shows in in the background for one scene.&&It's extraordinarily encouraging to hear that, given how closed-up so many publishers are with IPs, thanks.&&What a refeshing take.&&Doubled up on the PTA.

> ""I was part of the process with Blomkamp, I was going to be in there with as a producer [...] **But there was no real script** and I was doing my own thing, so **Fox decided to [scrap it]**""

In another interview:
> “It was an idea that evolved from, I believe, **a 10-page pitch**, and I was meant to be part of the producers on that. It didn’t evolve. Fox decided that they didn’t want to do it and that was it.&&I rate District 9 as the top theater experience of my entire life, and for one very special reason. I knew nothing about it going in. I had never heard of it. I had not seen a single trailer. While waiting in line to get tickets, I asked my friend ""So, what's this movie about anyway?"" He answered ""Aliens and Peter Jackson."" OKAY.

Needless to say, I will treasure the proceeding hour and a half forever.&&It holds up, it's still one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time.&&Same. I introduced it to my husband last year when I found out he had never watched it. Now feels like a good time to watch it again.&&I watched it once and loved it. Then kind of forgot about it until it was being shown on TV so I watched it again. It was even better than I remembered it. 

Despite being a cliffhanger it actually stands really well as a single movie, that's probably why I didn't keep wondering about a sequel. That would be awesome though.&&Elysium was a film that tackled social issues that we are facing more than ever in America. With Trump wanting a wall and the illegal immigration I can see another film in the Elysium universe. Elysium really hit home for me being i'm in Southern California, Hispanic, and first generation born in the US. My parents immigrated before I was born and I've seen that struggle first hand.&&Maybe it's exploring the aliens culture a bit deeper. They were basically the wage slaves of their culture if I remember correctly. &&I mostly just want a conclusion to the story. I personally don't need it to follow the same themes, I just hate it when a story goes unfinished.&&A prequel would be amazing. Footage from when the aliens first arrived &&He means a real world issue that affects him. D9 was allegorical to real things happening in South Africa, where he's from.

No comment, just pointing that fact out.

:]&&You won't be disappointed. Their stage show is bananas.&&Me too. Me and the bf saw Chappie when it came out, having read a bit about the film and Die Antwoord in a magazine article I think. So we watched the film and loved it, and that night we went on a DA YouTube binge. They're now one of our favourite bands, as a couple, and we rarely agree on stuff like that. 

I bet they're awesome live, I'm a bit jealous.&&I started enjoying Die Antwoord a lot more once I realized they're a satirical act *a la* Borat.  I always knew they were over-indulging in the ridiculousness, but I didn't realize that it was all an act.  Then it made more sense to me why people like Aphex Twin were collaborating with them.&&i remember reading this when the film came out, - i owe a debt of gratitude to vince, because his review is of the film I had in my head, ""gleeful goofiness and earnest philosophical questions can coexist, even harmonize, within an absurdist lark.""&&Love Vince Mancini's reviews, and I've been reading them for years. He has a unique and thoughtful perspective, and he's turned me on to great movies I otherwise would have passed on&&""BITCH STEAL DADDY'S CAR?!""&&I love them, especially Ninja's tale of Kanye: 

https://youtu.be/Rqa8p1xbjds &&Yolandi tho 😍&&The scene where Yolandi comforts a hurt Chappie is heartbreaking. Screw the haters, that film had crazy amounts of heart to it.&&I related a lot to the programmer guy that made the AI in the first place, having his work towards something good ruined by bad people on both sides (gangs on one, evil megacorp on the other). As a scientist, this is one of my biggest fears.&&My theory is that straight-laced sci-fi fans might not get Die Antwoord because of their loopiness. But, IDK, as a person from a third world country I really dug their deranged smorgasborg creole pop culture punky grimy mishmash. They're ridiculous and goofy counter-cultural personalities. 

That's probably not something that grabs sci-fi fans who prefer Doctorfessor Sciencey vonRationalmann going ""my quadrucorder says the quantums are polarized"" or Sergeteanant Soldierino Marangerine McGunshooter going ""ooorahooah check your six oscar mike at the five yard line."" It also helps that the scientist and soldierman either run away or shoot at threats that are basically foreigners in either forehead ridges or blue/green skin paints (or better looking alien designs if the budget can afford it).

It's just too out of the very tight box of tropes, cliches and conventions people are comfortable with in sci-fi. 

I mean, of course Chappie as a movie has issues... Blomkamp needs better writers. But I really dug it, it's a guilty pleasure and it is hilariously fun. Like SPEED RACER. &&Chappie himself was relate-able. But he had shitty parents.&&It didn't resonate with me because it had a kinda shitty screenplay. Had perfectly fine ideas, it was just boring and had a pretty haphazard plot structure.&&> maybe thought they were overdoing it?

that was the general census of the hate

i don't give a fuck I didn't know who they were and they jumped up into my favorite ppl list after that movie. 
&&Man what a quote. I don't even play WH and that sounds dope.&&praise the emprah&&You mean 18 primarchs... You must be imagining the numbers 2 and 11...&&Tl;Dr - The fall of the Western Roman Empire and subsequent Dark Ages of religious persecution, but on an intergalactic scale.&&BUT ROWBOAT GIRLYMAN IS BACK&&Loud and clear!&&I hope he does.  People at Microsoft need to make this happen.  The HALO short that Blomkamp did was simply outstanding.  My son and I were just talking about it the other day after watching ""Firebase"" and how unbelievable it is that Microsoft has yet to further capitalize on this incredible IP.  Get Blomkamp and some other creatives into a writer's room, give them the time and space to create and map out the stories they want to tell, and let them get to work.  I've no doubt there are incredible stories here just waiting to be told, and I firmly believe, after watching the short film, that Blomkamp is the guy to head it up.

C'mon, Microsoft.  Give it a shot.&&Who's that?&&""Earth go hard!"" - The Aliens&&Only a Marine would watch a dude get crushed by a grav hammer and think ""I need to get me a piece of that""&&You're up to date on the info.&&Yup, just got to meet Peter Jackson and I'm all set.&&Do it at indie theaters on the same weekend around the world? The Harvest 2017? Show the official ones, popular fan made films, and local filmmakers' work? Have Blomkamp do an official one somewhere and stream it on something like sidestream.com so he can offer running commentary? I like the way you think.     

Hey u/kpereira, make it happen! (It's not like you don't already have plenty to do!)&&A couple years ago I got into the idea of opening my own drive in theater. I started looking into what it takes, I started reading lots of forums and looking into the equipment and what it takes. Turns out it is super expensive and not worth it. Hell if you want to screen any decent movie 90% of ticket sales goes to the production company's. Theaters operate on concession sales which most people sneak in anyways. What I did find out though is there is a huge niche hobby group of theater enthusiasts that will set up these mobile theater screens for neighborhoods. They'll have these private movie nights for huge groups of people but are routinely troubled with the issue of licensing. For instance they can't just play some Disney movie or they risk huge fines, same goes for PPV events and other media. To get one movie at times it also means you gotta buy some type of package or you find there's some type of agreement with local theaters that prevent you from being able to show a movie.  I'm bringing this up because if this is a grassroots type of movement I think it would be a great opportunity to incorporate these enthusiasts into the plan. It would be cool to see these neighborhood theaters pop up with selective screenings of these movies.  I think both oatstudio could get a cult following from this niche group that can help generate profits by making it easier for these people to get licenses to show movies then it already is while also making cool community events for fans. &&I don't think a vote works here. It works if you get crowdfunding from people who are okay that they're simply funding the studio, but I think what most people want to fund is a specific product. So if you have a bunch of people crowdfunding and then vote, you're left with what is very possibly a majority of funders who wanted a different movie. Let's say 40% vote for option B. but 30% vote for A. and C. Then, 60% of your backers don't get what they really want.

It's tricky, because the tide can really turn against the company if the backers rally behind a complaint, well founded or not. It has happened with lots of indie projects. Groups of people can be unruly and nasty. This is the last thing a well-meaning indie company needs when they are already scraping for funds.

Perfect example is No Man's Sky. Developer's meant well, and objectively released a game that was as described if lacking in certain detail. However, certain groups of the gaming community are toxic and will apply whatever negative adjectives they want to the developers, without actually knowing the Developers' intent. The blight spreads across the entire community and you get a nasty international mob whining like petulant children.

Crowdfunding is great, but it needs a backbone built of a comprehensive road map and a well-managed communication line between Producers/Developers and the backers.

I personally would be fine throwing a bit of money at this studio, but I personally prefer to put my money toward the vision of a properly conceived product.&&Such a special moment <3&&2 hour reminder, im awake and in awe.&&HA!

We watched it twice in a row.&&Same here. When one of the bad guys was liquefied by the alien weapons my friend and I turned to one another with mutual 'This gonna be good' expressions. Great experience going in knowing next to nothing.&&I went and saw that movie with 3 friends and two of them walked out and theater hopped to go watch 500 Days of Summer because they thought District 9 was boring. Needless to say, I was more than appalled by their actions. &&It was just so different from anything else at the time. That's what made it so great for me. && I think it's only going to get more relevant as time goes on. If Climate Change worsens, it won't matter if it's caused by humans or not, developed countries will be facing a massive refugee crisis that makes the current one look like peanuts. People in developed countries close to the equator or on coastlines will likely become refugees themselves.

One thing that struck me about the film is that one of the main villain's justification for her actions was that she was doing it all for her kids despite the fact that overpopulation was the problem plaguing the Earth in the movies. Her blindness to her own hypocrisy, the abandonment of principles and the unquestioning turn towards tribalism in the face of unsolvable adversity are far too familiar and human traits that I think may be easy to miss while watching the film.&&Life, and films, are about timing and I feel like Elysium was about 5 years too early to really hit the marks it wanted. It also might have needed a bit more time to stew on the screen writing stage, as it was a bit heavy handed and moralizing when it needed a more nuanced touch with more emotional impact to really land the punches it wanted. &&That's part of why I liked District 9. It left me wanting to know more, wanting to have that closure on Wikus and Christopher and their families, but *I didn't feel cheated* out of an ending. It's an ending where all you can do is wonder and be as optimistic or pessimistic as you feel at that time.&&On the bright side of things, it's not like it could be worse than the current anime...&&Ah.&&The embodiement of REEEEEEEE&&It also looked like it had brains being held by hands on its back.

https://youtu.be/2YpX6MumIr8&&Agreed. Really, only reason for buying physical copies are for these special featurettes and commentaries.

She has the ability to get into main stream news.&&It's doable, we'll try to make it happen (some crowdfunded video games have raised lots of money, for example). Just keep producing awesome stuff and make sure the campaign will be promoted as wide as possible. 

I'd contribute good money to such a campaign just to see your ideas expanded. You've shown us a glimpse of what is possible, I think many people would like to see more of it. 
&&Records are made to be broken &&I really hope Funhaus, and RoosterTeeth help promote it, and you. &&Obviously.&&100%. I've seen them twice and it was fucking crazy both times. &&This is exactly why I always tell people chappie is my favorite film. It perfectly combines seriousness with absurdity, all while not relying on over used tropes. I sincerely loved chappie.&&Thank you for confirming I wasn't crazy thinking that the more absurd aspects were intentionally so, because I loved it as such, and it's not something I can say so matter-of-factly. Interpretation is one thing, but assuming intent of creative work is something else.

That quote would work really well for Southland Tales as well, which didn't make the goofy and philosophical sci-fi fusion as digestible as you did, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Also, thank you for everything you're doing with Oats and the assets on Steam. I've been really enjoying reviewing them as study for my own 3D work. I was skeptical of Steam's use, as it's rather limited on the film distribution front, but it's at least a great way to get assets like that to those who have an interest and/or relevant hobby/profession. 

I hope the platform doesn't hold you back from what you really want Oats to be though. &&That was fantastic. Like one of those Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories.&&Thank you, that was awesome
&&When THEY think you're weird, you know something is up. &&I'm both a sci fi fan and a Die Antwoord fan (I discovered them because of District 9). I didn't like the movie because I felt it was just ""Ninja and Yolandi: The Movie"". Any allegory or message was overshadowed by them, and their parts were cringey for the most part.

I still like the rest of Neil's stuff, but that one was a miss for me. &&That's about a third of the intro to every 40k novel. It's a fantastic way to set the mood.

>*It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.*

>*Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.*

>*To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.*

I was prepared for a straight-up this-thing-just-filles-people-with-smoking-meat-holes and other violence that we could ""relate"" to.

"When writing the James Bond film 'You Only Live Twice' (1967), author Roald Dahl was given a formula for Bond girls: The first is killed by the enemy midway ""preferably in Bond's arms"", the second is an enemy Bond seduces who also dies, and the third survives to the end of the film.",26714,6ldxc7,http://www.talkingpix.co.uk/Article_Bondage%20man.html,1281,1499260370.0,,"TIL Roald Dahl wrote a James Bond movie&&Bond had yet to come face to face with the true masterminds behind Spectre: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean&&You forgot to add: 

""On the next movie, Bond is carrying business as usual. What happened to the hot lady he got at the end of his last adventure, who was apparently his true soul mate?  Well, he got bored of her after a month and never called back"".&&The children's book author was also a screenwriter. From the article:
>Such attitudes were toned down in the films, but the undiluted chauvinism of Ian Fleming's writings were given full reign in *Playboy* magazine, which serialised the Bond novels in 1964. In the same year the third film, *Goldfinger*, established the 'Bond Girl' as a regular feature. Roald Dahl said that when he was writing the screenplay for *You Only Live Twice* (1967) he was given this formula: 

>>""you put in three girls...Girl number one is pro-Bond. She stays around roughly through the first reel of the picture. Then she is bumped off by the enemy, preferably in Bond's arms. ""

>Girl number two is anti-Bond and usually captures him, and he has to save himself by knocking her out with his sexual charm and power. She gets killed in an original (usually grisly) fashion mid-way through the film. The third girl will manage to survive to the end of the film.&&They should stick with the formula in today's movies, but have Bond kill at least one of them to mix it up.&&[deleted]&&Oddly enough, the time i was able/old enough to recognize this formula was the movie that tried to change it up: the world is not enough. Really did not like that one. &&Goldfinger has a similar formula. Pussy Galore FTW.&&TIL Roald Dahl (James & the Giant Peach, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, BFG, etc.) wrote a Bond film. 

The more you know...&&Wasn't there a Bond where one bond girl filled two of the roles?  As in: she faked her death in the 1st act and then got killed in the 2nd?  Or maybe flipped sides when her boss tried to kill her in the 2nd?&&I wish he would have just stuck to the novel. &&I dog sat for Roald Dahl's daughter Chantelle once about a year ago... she's interesting to say the least and she has 3 Chinese Crested pups and they are the most spoiled pooches on the planet (they had their own room and closets full of clothes), we had to lotion them up multiple times a day because they're hairless. It was... an experience. 

edit: phone autocorrected Roald to Ronald, fixed it &&I remember a shitty self help book from years back that put too much emphasis on that you, a woman, should aspire to be a Bond girl.  Factoids like this cements the fact that I think that sentiment is bullshit.

What it comes down is you either get fridged, have your ideals compromised and then die for it, or become a glorified one night stand.  My hate myself but I'm better than all of that crap.&&And it works everytime, Sean Connery is GOAT&&Mr. Bond plays by kill, marry, fuck.&&Not going to lie, but as a life-long fan of James Bond novels, I think the author of that article is full of shit and his justification for how horrible Ian Fleming's attitude to women is largely stems from quotes taken from completely unrelated sources who clearly have as little idea as he does.

Ian Fleming tended to write pretty nuanced and convincing female characters with backstories and strengths of their own. &&Congratulations, reddit, we killed the site.

> Cold War spy movies came and went, but Bond out lived the genre and established an unassailable niche of its own. The Bond formula is so powerful that it can be copied and sustained by many others, like Michael Caine, James Coburn and Dean Martin who respectively starred in the Harry Palmer, Flint and Matt Helm film series. The Carry On team even joined the fray with Carry On Spying, and there was the unfortunate full-length animation film Freddie As F.R.O.7. TV series also copied Bond, for example The Man From Uncle owes a substantial debt to Bond, especially in terms of its mixture of girls and gadgets, and Get Smart like the Carry On team wrung humour out of the world of Bond. In more recent years James Cameron gave us True Lies with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Bond coping with family life.
> A prime-time documentary 30 Years of James Bond (London Weekend Television, 1992, U.K. director Alasdair Macmillan, U.S.A. director, and producer Lorna Dickinson) emphasised their special effects and gadgets. It was diplomatic (blinkered) of the documentary makers to ignore the fact that Bond was really a homicidal sex maniac who was barely under the control of Her Majesty's Secret Service. No mention was made of the Cold war context of the films or how they became less realistic and more like spectacular travelogues, no mention was made of the swinging-sixties permissiveness or the role (or lack of role) of women. In a world with no Cold War but with AIDS there is the feeling that Bond's reason for existence and his behaviour are no longer appropriate.

> Such misogyny did not worry Ian Fleming, but when his novels were transferred to the screen humour and irony was used to soften the impact. Roger Moore in particular shamelessly undermined the Bond mystique which, ironically alienated many viewers, as did the opinion that he was a one eyebrow actor. Nonetheless Moore was able to keep Bond alive during the 1970s and 1980s. During this period the ‘Bond Girl’ formula gave way to more assertive women, and with the arrival of Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence To Kill (1989) there was the introduction of the ‘Bond Woman’ who can challenge and equal Bond. Though this seems to be a mere tweaking of the formula, at the end of the day Bond is the central heterosexual hero who expects to be surrounded by women. Whether they love him or hate him is irrelevant, their glamour and beauty is the main reason for their inclusion. (Even with the introduction of the more politically correct Pierce Brosnan ‘his’ women are still pictured with him along with his latest cars and gadgets, suggesting that they are equally usable and disposable at his whim.) 
> 
> Furthermore: 
> 
> Though Bond elaborates myths of nationhood, he can only do so through racism. He dislikes men from Russia and the Balkans, is horrified by blacks and Chinese, finds the French ridiculous and the Italians are ""good for nothing but wearing monogrammed shirts and spending the day smoking"". He cannot help reminding the Germans about the war, and he never trusts the Irish. He is particularly patronising about Americans.  
> {Pascoe, David. 'Bond. ..Junk Bond', The Modern Review, Volume 1, Issue 5, Oct. -Nov. 1992.) 
> Some people think that these factors have killed off James Bond, but there are several projects in the pipe-line aiming to bring him back to active service. (Most of this text was written in 1992. Brosnan debuted in the 1995 Goldeneye six years after Licence to Kill, which was Dalton’s last appearance as Bond.) In the U.S.A. they want to make a big budget TV series but copyright wrangles could scupper this plan. Certainly producers cannot easily ignore such a potential source of profit even if the politics of the enterprise are rather dodgy. 
> Will Bond die? Should he be killed? I think he will survive to fight another day. (I was right for once!) First of all there seem to be plenty of conflicts and bad guys out there for a super hero like Bond to tackle. Indeed, films like Live And Let Die have centred on international drug dealing, so the Cold War is not essential for his survival. Old sixties TV series are back in vogue and a 'new' Bond can play on this nostalgia value. 
> 
> Many Hollywood film directors grew-up watching Bond movies and are more than willing to work on such projects. In the 30 Years of James Bond documentary it was implied that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg would never have got where they are today without having watched the adventures of Bond. This is an obvious simplification but their Indiana Jones trilogy was a conscious effort to recreate the excitement and thrills of Bond, and Spielberg has publicly stated that he would like to have directed a Bond movie (this explains his use of Sean Connery in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - see: Slade, Darren and Watson, Nigel, Supernatural Spielberg, VALIS Books, London, 1992, p.57). 
> 
> It is hard to distinguish one Bond movie from another, especially since they have relied on re-treading similar storylines with different gadgets and exotic locations, yet they are good examples of exciting colourful, noisy big-screen action. They are what Chris Savage King calls trash but he asks: ""What film series provided such cheap thrills using such luxurious means?"" ('Kitsch kitsch, bang bang', The Modern Review, Volume 1, Issue 5, Oct. - Nov. 1992.) He thinks we are not going to see their like again but I trust that trash cannot be so easily be dumped. 
> 
> If words are likely to be the ammunition required to kill off Bond then these should do it: 
> 
> He is to secret agenting as Alan Whicker is to TV journalism, a sort of blue-blazered round-the-world anachronism, the ultimate hob-nobber. It is not too fanciful to regard Whicker as having modelled himself on Bond. Whilst Bond battles with Dr. No, Whicker interviews Papa Doc. In each case the status quo is preserved.

&&I literally just heard this yesterday on the CinemaSins Podcast.&&In addition to his beloved children's books, Dahl was a WWII flying ace and intelligence officer.

In Moonraker, Roger Moore seduces a beautiful woman he'd just met who was working for the bad guys...instantly with nothing more than a suave leer.  It was like he had a superpower.  She loses all inhibitions and just a minute or so after the banging she is killed.  At that point it was like the screenwriter wasn't even trying anymore.
Bond fan...but what a shitty movie that was...&&Huh. Didn't know Roald Dahl had anything to do with this. &&In ""The Jennifer Morgue"", a villain is protected by a complex spell that can only be bypassed by someone who fits the James Bond archetype perfectly.  The protagonist, an intelligence agent who is not like Bond at all, finds himself being manipulated into strange situations by his superiors so he can slip past the ""Only James Bond could stop my evil plan"" filter, including deliberately being partnered with a typical Bond Girl.&&Chitty, Chitty, Bang Bang was written by him as well.

edit - I should have been more clear: Dahl wrote the screenplay for the movie.

Bonus edit -  Ray Bradbury wrote the screenplay for Moby Dick starring Gregory Peck and directed by John Houston.

Double secret bonus edit.  According to IMDB Dahl also worked on Moby Dick as a script doctor.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049513/trivia?item=tr2550916  &&Yeah, that fact is way more interesting than the formula that's supposed to be the point of this post.&&[When you read about what Roald Dahl did during WW2](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2655185/Roald-Dahls-seductive-work-as-a-British-spy.html), the plotlines about ""James Bond saves the world with the power of his dick"" actually start to make more sense. 

>Drawing on previously unpublished letters and other documents, American journalist Jennet Conant has written about Dahl's numerous sexual conquests. 

>They include Millicent Rogers, the heiress to a Standard Oil fortune, and Clare Boothe Luce, a right-wing congresswoman and the wife of the publisher of Time magazine. 

>Boothe Luce proved so frisky, Dahl later claimed to have begged his superiors to take him off the assignment, only to be told to get back into the bedroom. 

>I think he slept with everybody on the east and west coasts that [was worth] more than $50,000 a year."" 

>Despite Dahl's reputation as ""one of the biggest cocksmen in America"", as described by previous biography, he was said to have passed on several useful pieces of intelligence

&&There are rumors that Dahl was Fleming's inspiration for Bond.

So I answered this one, of course, since it ends with [his new wife dying in his arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgndOK2zuY0). The answer on the card was ""none of them"". Did the Trivial Pursuit writers hate her character that much?&&Austin Powers II has a brilliant joke about that!

[As APII starts with the honey moon with Vanessa Kensington, it's revealed she's one of the fembots from the previous movie. When Austin tells this to Basil Expedition, Basil just replies ""*Yes, we knew it all along, sadly.

Or [just power,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pUXH1Bye88) in some cases. Christ that scene was disturbing.&&Roald Dahl also wrote books for big kids.

See [My Uncle Oswald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Oswald), in which the protagonist steals the sperm of the rich and intelligent in order to sell it to wealthy women. He does this using an irresistible aphrodisiac and the help of his accomplice, Yasmin Howcomely (a veritable Bond Girl in her own right).&&He killed Electra King in The World is Not Enough. 

That should count because she was telling a Bond girl before being revealed as the villain.&&That could really work with the troubled Bond thing they are doing.&&I'd love to see a spreadsheet of Bond movies versus Tropes.  *Tomorrow Never Dies* and ""Girlfriend/Wife of Enemy Seduced by Bond, Dies in Arms""?  Check!    &&Did that not happen [in Skyfall when he shoots at Severine with the dueling pistol on the island because his hand is shaking after being found to not have been cleared for field ops?](#spoiler) 

Edit: Remember to use the spoiler tag before you make the same comment as the other 10+ people below. [As many of you have said, Severine is killed by Silva... because Bond missed. If he had hit the whiskey glass she might have lived. Obviously this is a what-if scenario but it's clear that his missed shot contributed directly to her demise.

His Bond Fell for the girl!&&Well, he sorta did fall in love with Vesper at the end of Casino Royale. &&The novels reveal that Bond has more attachment for women than the movie version. He falls madly in love with Vesper and pines for her throughout the series. He marries. He often talks about settling down and living a normal life. There is rarely more than one ""Bond Girl"" per novel, making him more like a serial monogamist than a playboy. 

The movie Bond is kind of like a porn with clothes on fantasy. &&Hence why Archer takes the piss with those tropes.&&Don't forget the obligatory bitchslap that serves as the opener to the seduction process!&&Casino Royale / QOS changed that though surely? Bond was in love with Vesper.&&In GoldenEye, if Xenia is the enemy, Natalya survives to the end, who was the one who died ""preferably in Bond's arms""?

Edit: Natalya not Natasha&&But you gotta admit, as far as the Brosnan movies go, TWINE is second only after Goldeneye. Tomorrow Never Dies was mediocre, although it did have a great motorcycle chase. When I was in second grade I thought Die Another Day was the coolest movie ever, but when you get a little older and watch all the other ones, you realize it's possibly the worst film of the entire series. TWINE on the other hand has some cool casino stuff, a whole thing with an oil pipeline, John Rys Davies. And unfortunately Denise Richards, who seems to forget that Starship Troopers was a parody of its own genre, and that you're not actually supposed to act like you're a cardboard cut out. &&Off the top of my head, I don't think The Living Daylights followed this formula.  That was well ahead of The World Is Not Enough.

Correct me if I'm wrong.&&The original line when Connery's bond meets her was I believe, ""I'm Pussy Galore,"" ... ""Well I can see that but what's your name?"" MPAA wouldn't let them get away with that one though haha. This movie was rated PG. &&The man fucked for England. 

I'm serious. 

Dahl was ordered to seduce the wives of influential Americans during WWII. &&*Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&&Probably a few of these. May Day from a View to a Kill flips sides at the end of the movie, for example.&&View to a Kill had Grace Jones' Mayday character sacrifice herself to save Bond because Walken left her to die I believe. 

The first situation sounds familiar but I can't place it. Maybe the one from World is not Enough. Girl who seems sympathetic in beginning is the actual villain. &&If he had, there would be vastly more hatred and disgust towards homosexual couples, especially women. Diamonds are Forever scratches the surface with those two gay hitman who act like freaking cartoon characters. &&Best part of this thread. Any more anecdotes?&&My roommates and I have been doing a rewatch of all the Bond films in order. The Connery films are generally good, but now as an adult they kinda skeeve me out. There are multiple instances of Bond committing what is pretty unquestionably sexual assault. I know it was a different era, and Connery was playing the character pretty closely to Fleming's original vision, but it's a little uncomfortable 50 years later.&&Sean is great, but I got the vibe he was phoning it in with this movie and ""Diamonds Are Forever"" later on. He was done playing Bond at that point. &&That movie has my favorite theme song!

&&But the space battle, at the end! Sheer spectacle and absurdity!&&Chitty Chitty Bang Bang makes sense that it was written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, though.&&I thought you meant the other way around, but Roald Dahl did write the screenplay of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, based off a story Ian Flemming wrote.&&Chitty Chitty Bang Bang can actually be read as a down-the-line anti-fascist Bond fantasy wrapped in kiddie elements... put on by the James Bond production team with Dick Van Dyke in the 007 slot. 

Ian Fleming as you know wrote the original book. Cubby Broccoli produced the movie. Ken Adam, the definitive Bond production designer of the '60s and '70s, designed CCBB. Dahl, who was working on the screenplay of ""You Only Live Twice"" around the same time, wrote the script. Gert ""Goldfinger"" Frobe mugs around in it. Desmond Llewelyn (Q) has a bit part. A supercar that rescues the heroes figures prominently. And so on. 

CCBB's Scrumptious Sweets factory set, or the Vulgarian castle interior, are kiddie versions of Adam's Fort Knox interior in ""Goldfinger"" or the sub-swallowing tanker in the later ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The movie also riffs on ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" (1965), another sprawling English special-effects comedy set in a halcyon English country dreamscape dotted with honking antique cars. TMMITFS preceded CCBB by three years, and CCBB rips it off shamelessly, dipping Lionel Jeffries into the English Channel instead of Gert Frobe, and again employing Benny Hill and other English music-hall/vaudeville stalwarts. 

With this movie Dahl deploys the Bondian elements of gadgetry, fantasy women and a solitary superman not against the Soviet bloc or SPECTRE, but Germanic (e.g. Vulgarian) fascism. (WWII had ended only 22 years previously and was obviously yet fresh in the minds of English moviemakers.) Robert Helpmann's Child Catcher is a more-or-less Mengele. But Van Dyke's Potts organizes a liberating army of Vulgarian children to storm the castle (exactly the way Sean Connery's 007 leads US astronauts to storm Blofeld's volcano in ""You Only Live Twice"") and the last sequence in Vulgaria, with mobs of dirty, underfed kids flooding out the front gates, suggests the liberation of Dachau. It's an unsubtle concentration camp allegory and a pretty dark place for a kid's film to go.&&Ian Fleming wrote Chitty! &&Wait, that's not a James Bond movie? /s&&Dahl wrote some unabashedly salacious adult fiction as well. A couple of examples from his official legacy website.

It's not very relevant to the movie discussion, but like the Fleming connection, it catches people off guard if they're only familiar with his children's books.&&**Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (James Bond Version) Synopsis:**

In Morocco, police are investigating the murder of a man on the 32nd floor of a highrise apartment - police are baffled as to how the murder was committed; the shattered window was seemingly made of bulletproof glass, and the door was locked from the inside. Moroccan police uncover the identity of the victim: international arms dealer Joseph Chitty.

Agent 007 is briefed on the situation - Joseph Chitty was actually Agent 003, under deep cover investigating the theft of uranium from a secret Rusian depot, suspected to be used for building a nuclear weapon. James Bond visits Chitty's apartment to look for clues, where he narrowly avoids the bullet from a sniper - looking out onto the city skyline, Bond sees no vantage point from where the bullet could possibly have been shot, but finds a red feather drifting in through the broken window. Q branch is called in for ballistic analysis on the shot.

Meanwhile Bond assumes the identity of a black market buyer in an effort to pursue 003's investigation. He tracks Chitty's case to the Running Dog Smuggling Network, a group in Hong Kong. M provides Bond with a friendly contact in the Smuggling Network: Sloh Bang, the sultry madam of the Smiling Hound bath house. With Bang's help, Bond tracks the stolen uranium to the ""Toots Sweet"" candy factory, managed by her brother Long Bang, and his assistant Truly Scrumptious. Sloh and Bond meet on the rooftop of the factory, high above the dark back alleys of Hong Kong. Sloh warns Bond that the factory owner is a mysterious underworld figure known only as ""The Chimney Sweep"" - before she can reveal The Chimney Sweep's identity, she is killed from above by an assassin wearing a silent stealth jetpack. Bond chases the assassin down, discovering them to be Truly Scrumptious, Long's assistant. She is taken for questioning.

Meanwhile, Q branch returns to Bond with the results of the ballistics test from Chitty's apartment - he was killed by a new form of bullet made from the casing of a depleted uranium shell, which explains how it broke through a bulletproof glass window. Furthermore, the trajectory of the bullet leads Q to believe that it was fired from an overhead position; an impossible shot given Bond's location in the apartment. Bond and Q agree that the sniper must have been using one of the stealth jetpacks, but Bond is not convinced that it was Truly.

Bond interrogates Truly and Long, who agree to lead him to The Chimney Sweep in exchange for his protection. They travel with Bond to Zurich where they arrange for Bond to meet The Chimney Sweep at a mountain resort outside of town. After allowing herself to be seduced by Bond, Truly locks him inside his chalet room and pumps poisonous gas through the vents. Bond manages to escape by climbing up a fireplace chimney, though Long is killed. Meanwhile, Truly goes to meet The Chimney Sweep (whose identity is unseen), and he kills her for failing to kill Bond, leaving her body in a chairlift for Bond to find while out skiing. The Chimney Sweep's men stop the chairlift midway up the mountain in an attempt to assassinate Bond, but he fends them off by slicing through the chairlift cable with a wristwatch sawblade, leaving them to fall to their deaths while he swings to safety.

Eventually Bond uses a Geiger counter built into a fountain pen to track a radiation signature which matches that of the assassin's depleted uranium bullet - it leads him to an abandoned toy factory registered to the deceased Long Bang. The factory is guarded, but Bond infiltrates the perimeter only to discover a crew of scientists building some kind of flying car. Bond is caught by a henchman known as the Catcher, a man with a red-feathered Tyrolean hat - Bond realizes he is the sniper who shot at him in Morrocco. The Catcher brings Bond to the Chimney Sweep - to Bond's astonishment, the Chimney Sweep is Joseph Chitty (or rather, Chitty's identical twin brother, Bombus Chitty).

Bombus explains that his plan was to build a flying vehicle that runs on uranium; a silent platform from which his sniper assassins could have a vantage point to any target. Bombus leaves Bond to be disposed of by the Catcher, who plans to drop him from the flying car into the icy waters of the Arctic Sea. Instead, Bond overpowers the Catcher, throws him from the car, and flies off towards a research post in northern Norway. There he meets Dr. Aletta Vulgari, who agrees to help study the flying car for a weakness. Between them and Q branch, it is discovered that the car cannot fly faster than 100mph without blowing its nuclear reactor. Aletta and Bond huddle together to keep warm during a power outage at the research station, and end up making love.

Later, Bond assaults Bombas' hideout (the toy factory near Zurich) with the help of the flying car and Dr. Vulgari. Bombas gives chase in his own flying car, but Bond manages to trick him into exceeding the car's speed limit by diving over a mountain side, causing the reactors of both cars to explode. Aletta assumes Bond has died in the explosion, but it was revealed that he used a jetpack to escape at the last moment. The two huddle together under the warmth of the flaming wreckage, while MI6 agents close in to rendezvous.

Bond makes a pun about Vulgari being ""a dirty girl"" before the closing credits
&&Titty Titty Gang Bang also. He was quite prolific. &&In China James Bond is Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&&It also gets posted to TIL a lot, so I guess it's assumed most people here know it.

But based on the comments here I guess not.  Also that Ian Fleming wrote Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or that Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for that too =)

You guys are the [lucky 10,000](https://www.xkcd.com/1053/)!&&Dald was part of the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (real name).

Dald's actual quote when asking to be taken off the Claire Booth Luce assignement.

>am all fucked out. That goddamn woman has absolutely screwed me from one end of the room to the other for three goddam nights. I went back to the Ambassador this morning, and I said, “You know it’s a great assignment, but I just can’t go on.”&&""Cocksmen: The Meaty Service"" &&Hold on, Boothe Luce? As in Lucille Bluth?&&> ""one of the biggest cocksmen in America""

Now there's an epitaph to have on your tombstone.&&Ladies love a man with a weird fucking name.&&>There are rumors that Dahl was Fleming's inspiration for Bond.

I always heard Christopher Lee was the inspiration. IIRC the two of them are cousins and served together in WWII.
&&They worked together as agents for the BSC during WWII. I'd say it's entirely possible.  Check out the book 'The Irregulars' by Jannet Conant. Fascinating stuff.&&I always heard the opposite of Dahl.

He was introverted and kind of a loner.&&He was an aviator right? At least, that's what he wrote about in ""over to you"" etc. &&These horrible crooks are different in looks&&what a magnificent creature.&&[...He took everything?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt_zCZBKvqg)&&Casino Royale was supposed to be the first Bond story and Vesper his first love.

And after his heartbreaking experience with her, Bond doesn't want to commit to one woman ever again.&&And that [one time he got married](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Bond)&&And walking off into the moonlight with lea seydoux at the end of spectre, inexplicably tossing his gun in the process.  He seems to be taking that one seriously.&&Well, you're forgetting his long flame miss moneypenny.&&And the other one he was married to for five minutes...&&I grew-up during the ""Golden Age"" of Bond movies, but I wasn't really impressed by them. Sure, they were kind of neat, but kind of silly, too.

I really appreciate the Daniel Craig era of Bond--and think that *Casino Royale* is the best of the best Bond movies.&&Vesper was supposed to be the one :/&&Or his wife in OHMSS. &&No one can replace Tracy I guess. &&Because it wasn't originally filmed as an ending, but the title sequence to the next movie Diamonds are Forever. It was cut from the following film due to Lazenby dropping out of his role as Bond, so it was then added to the end of that movie. It did actually release that way so no idea what Trivial Pursuit was smoking...&&&&I just want to say, I love that you put spoiler tags before posting about a joke from a 20-year old movie.

Immediate edit: holy shit. Austin Powers is a 20 year old movie. I feel old now.&&This is like when the producers wanted Bond to get help from Michelle Yeoh's character Wai Lin in *Die Another Day*. Nothing could have made that film good, but that would have made it at least very slightly more tolerable, for a few minutes, at least.&&But it's not until the *next* fella that he finally gets the job done.&&Please remind me.&&[Corinne Dufour's death in *Moonraker*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PasdxEYHhMo) also comes to mind.&&somehow don't remember James Bond being a rapist in my childhood recollections&&I feel unclean &&I knew what scene you were referring to before I clicked the link. I watched all the movies with my dad and remember him being super embarrassed by this. 

He talked his way around a lot of Bond stuff, but this is pretty impossible to defend. &&I mean you can also interpret it as her battling between her attraction to him and her original resentment for him, but I totally see how this comes off as rape-y too. I just noticed at the end she kind of, ""embraces it"", for better or worse. 

Initially he keeps her there by force, but when she gets her chance to walk outside, she walks back over near him for example.

Teaches inappropriate ways to seduce a woman and all if you take it one way, but the other way can also be considered rough and weird foreplay.

Also, have no idea what precludes this scene, haven't seen that movie before.&&He never misses.&&One of the really underrated Bond women, and films too.&&and xenia in goldeneye. 

don't fuck with pierce. &&What about when he catches a bullet with a Bond in from diamonds are forever (or from Russia with love)&&Wouldn't it be crazy if bond became trans and had to kill himself because he's one of the Bond girls. &&Make sure you have a backup black ink cartridge 

EDIT: or change to 99% gray as ive been reminded 100 times&&He misses. Silva kills her directly after.&&You could argue that M was the Bond girl of Skyfall. Sure, she wasn't in the conventional sense (thank fuck for that, as much as I love Judi Dench), but the movie has so much focus on them and their relationship that you can't deny it's out of the question. And it also [ties into the ""dying in his arms"" part](#spoiler)&&I'm pretty sure Javier Bardem shoots her, not Bond. &&Silva shoots her, not Bond&&""This never happened to the other fellow.""&&Didn't Craig have two films about his love/loss for Vesper?&&CR was a reboot, so Vesper was canonically his first love (at least as 007). It'd probably be different if he fell in love with her, but was still technically the same Bond from the previous 20 movies.&&The bitch is dead. &&Which was meant as a prequel and his first mission.

Although I never got how he was supposed to then be getting too old in Skyfall. Was that movie intended to be back to the ""present"", just using the same actor?&&Really? Because I'm halfway through You Only Live Twice (the novel) and it opens with him seducing a geisha girl, then partway through him and an associate visit a brothel after a night of drinking. Later he shacks up with kissy suzuki then leaves when she's pregnant with his kid. &&The dead hooker joke took on a whole new layer of humor after reading these comments.&&Boris

*I am invincible!*&&006, kind of. His death at the start would've had more of an emotional impact on the character than any random dollybird.&&> Natalya not Natasha

The same name, Natasha is short for Natalya.&&Natalya&&I think Tomorrow Never Dies has aged far far better than a lot of Bond films. I too thought that Die Another Day was the coolest film until I rewatched it as an adult&&Golden Eye is probably the best Bond movie. But Casino Royal is the best movie out of the Bond movies.&&> When I was in second grade I thought Die Another Day was the coolest movie ever, but when you get a little older and watch all the other ones, you realize it's possibly the worst film of the entire series

At least the sword fight was cool&&> John Rys Davies

I think you mean Robbie Coltrane not John Rys Davies.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001059/?ref_=tt_cl_t5&&I really enjoyed TWINE.  I especially liked that the pre intro sequence carried over with the rest of the film. And I REALLY liked how die another day not only did the same but also had the intro sequence itself add to the story. I was not a huge fan of the rest of the film tho.&&That's correct. They made a conscious effort to make Bond monogamous in that one because AIDS was a big scare back then. &&To be fair the only other option was R, PG13 didn't exist yet&&Please write a book about this called ROALD DAHL FUCKS FOR ENGLAND. Even if you just made it up, this is a book the world needs.&&Besides being a spy in WWII, he was also in the Royal Air Force. &&Is there a source for this?&&>with those two gay hitman who act like freaking cartoon characters

Umm .. Doesn't everyone in James Bond act like a cartoon character?&&Are you saying that the movie of Diamonds are Forever stuck closely to the book? If so, I would beg to differ. Diamonds are Forever is one of the best bond novels and one of the worst movies. 

I can only think of two Bond novels where the movie was pretty much analogous to the book: From Russia with Love and Thunderball. &&if you're expecting the Bond series to handle these topics with any semblance of grace then you will probably be disappointed. it's the world's most famous power fantasy, written by a British dude in the 50s. and even then there were those who found the series style distasteful and boorish.&&The dogs had ~30 different types of food out on the floor in bowls because they ""needed options"" (they were given fresh cooked chicken breast EVERY NIGHT even though none of them ever touched it) and she had the generic-rich-person-squished-face-cat who was a devil and hated everyone and everything living and would hiss death sounds at you if you got too close. &&I can only think of the Goldfinger scene thats really fucked up&&The casual ass slapping to the women around him really caught me off guard.

Either way I still think the first 3 Bond films are some of the best in the series. Outside of the misyoginy of the time, they have aged really well. 

EDIT: because I'm getting weird comments, the ass slapping caught me off guard because you would never see that in a film today, it was really surprising. Yes I know that's true to the cannon, it's still surprising to see it in a film viewing it from today's point of view.&&Put it underwater with spearguns and it's Doctor No. [edit: Thunderball]&&He only wrote the screen play. It's an Ian Flemming Original. &&Fuck grandpa joe&&James Bond makes sense that it was written by the author of My Uncle Oswald.&&Wasn't Roald Dahl an actual spy?&&Thanks!  Yes!  This is what happens when I try to post before having my coffee.&&Wow. I know what I'm writing my Ph.D dissertation about.
&&Cubby Broccoli.... Great name.&&This guy knows his Bond. &&Somehow, it *does* seem like a Bond film.

But then, Ian Fleming did write the source material.

But I did not know until today that Roald Dahl did the screenplay.&&I preferred *Willy Wanker And The Chocolate Fucktoy* or *Fantastic Mr Fucks*&&That's where the real money is.

I would recommend reading Dahl's memoir *Going Solo*. Super interesting stuff about his time in the war. &&He used to write his books sat in his shed with a tea tray on his lap.&&When Dahl was living in New York he was a glamorous social butterfly and probably a spy.&&Are we talking about Fleming or Dahl here. Things is getting convoluted.&&He got kicked out of the RAF b/c of his eyesight and became a spy and slept with a lot of women to get intel.

If you've watched the movie, you know the one I mean...&&Watched that one last night for the first time ever (no idea how I missed it before,  I've got the complete set on Blu-Ray!). It's a very strange Bond film. Worth a watch though.

[Where the family motto comes from discussion is a nice little surprise, which is becomes the title of the 'The World is not Enough' bond film. The fourth wall breaking comment at the beginning was also an oddity. After he saves the girl she runs away - Bond turns to the camera and says ""well that never happened to the other guy"". This was the first non Sean Connery Bond film so that line was pretty much his introduction to the fans. ](#spoiler)&&The queen of thorns seems to be doing alright for herself these days.&&[And he also got kind of married in You only live twice](https://zuts.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/you-only-live-twice.jpg) :P&&Watched that last year, utterly strange Bond movie but also very good.

Ah, Hollywood.&&It was especially jarring since he got with an age appropriate woman in Monica Bellucci in the first act.&&Casino royale isn't just a fantastic Bond movie, it's just a fantastic film on its own merits. &&Casino Royale was a remarkable movie and really broke the mold for Bond films. He was very physical and emotional and for the most part got his hands very dirty instead of relying on stupid gadgets.

They started steering away from that back to some of the cheesiness in more recent ones, really disappointing. 

Casino Royale perfectly captured Bond as a refined veneer covering a barely-restrained brutal killer.&&I don't understand.  Did Lazenby drop out of the role before OHMSS was released?  And why did they shoot footage for the next film before releasing the first?&&[deleted]&&It's a good joke!&&Weren't there rumours a few months ago of Austin Powers 4 potentially happening?

When he wuh?&&What?&&If he ends up being the second Bond girl then things will get very confusing.&&LOL&&How the fuck does your brain work and how fast can you start working on the screenplay? &&They should have a movie where Bond teaches a recruit a rule of ""No Women, No Children"", then has to go on the run and gets a sex change to escape his former protege. I'd watch that.&&You can also change the text to 99 percent gray&&Or just set it to #010101&&Waste of good scotch.&&It's treason, then.&&Yep. The Casino Royale story line was the first book that Fleming wrote. The real reason that Lazenby didn't come back is that he thought that the hippie counter culture would kill off the franchise and he didn't want to shave his beard. He explains it all in a great documentary called Becoming Bond.&&You can tell his heart isn't in it when he says that line though. One of the things I love about Craig, you can see the fragility behind the cold murderous exterior.&&Yeah now he's with some other chick from *Spectre*

But she'll be conveniently gone in the next movie&&Well, the Golden Eye reboot on the Nintendo Wii retconned Daniel Craig into Pierce Brosnan's role.  Also, Judy Dench played M for both Brosnan and Craig's bonds.  I just assumed they were playing the same Bond in a retconned fashion, with Casino Royale and Quantum taking place before Brosnan's stories, and Skyfall and Spectre taking place after.&&I suppose I'm taking the series in aggregate. 

* Casino Royale - falls desperately in love with Vesper Lynd, clouding his judgment
* Live and Let Die - Partners and later falls in love with Solitaire
* Moonraker - Has unrequited love for Gala Brand (one of the few sexless Bond novels)
* Diamonds are Forever - Is cautious at first, but eventually falls in love with seductress Tiffany Case
* From Russia with Love - Tatiana Romanova all the way through
* Dr. No - Honeychile Rider is the only Bond girl, and I don't believe that he has sex with her at any point in the novel (not remembering all that well)
* Goldfinger - The first Bond novel where he has sex with two women, but to be fair, the first has been dead for some time before he beds the second. Also notable for a ridiculous ""conversion therapy"" outcome with Pussy Galore. 
* Thunderball - I'm pretty sure that Domino is the only bond girl in the novel but can't remember for sure. 
* The Spy Who Loved Me - Told from the female's perspective, so obviously only one girl. As a side note, this whole novel just struck me as an exercise in vanity on Fleming's part. 
* On Her Majesty's Secret Service - I forgot whether the novel mirrors the movie in that Bond sleeps with one of the ""vessel"" women, but obviously this is the novel where Bond gets married to Tracy. 
* You Only Live Twice - As a quasi-finale, I found this novel really disappointing. I trust that the sequence was as you say, but the entire novel is a departure from traditional Bond stories. The ending with the whole amnesia thing is bizarre. 
* The Man with a Golden Gun - The beginning is as bizarre as the ending to You Only Live Twice. I found this to be a cartoonish attempt to revive the series. I don't remember much about Bond girls in this one except for the Jamaican waitress that he seems to fancy. 

So taken in the aggregate, I would say that novel Bond does take his relationships with women rather seriously. You get to hear his thoughts, and it's clear throughout that his choice not to get married has more to do with his job and duties than his own personal preferences. &&Time for me to find some new slashfic!&&[deleted]&&The media controlling the headlines and influencing governments plot is probably even more relevant today.&&Which is why prior to 1984ish, pg movies were nuts. Jaws was rated PG and a child is torn to shreds fully on screen while his mother, panicked, is wondering why everyone is running back to shore and yelling for him. And if you haven't already, please watch ""This Film is not yet Rated."" It was on Netflix for a while. Really exposes the sleazy way that the MPAA came to be, and the arbitrary way in which films are rated. Spoiler alert: it's a board of appointed parents who rate movies based on what they think would be appropriate for their children. The King's Speech was given an R rating. Think about that. &&http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2655185/Roald-Dahls-seductive-work-as-a-British-spy.html&&Loads I imagine. His life was pretty well documented.

Come on 1971. &&No, I didn't mean that. I was just making a general statement that Ian Fleming sprinkles a lot of distaste for gay people into his books, and it's especially prominent in some of the earlier films. I haven't actually read Diamonds are Forever yet. Only saw the movie. &&Dont forget Casino Royale!  A great movie because it followed so closely the novel-minus Baccarat of course.  Suivi! &&I don't, and I'm not. I've seen every bond movie numerous times, and I love the fact that many of the movies are such exposures of the times when they were filmed.

Roald Dahl&&How weird is you're name on a scale of one to Benedict cumberbatch?&&Also Jon Pertwee. And then he basically played Doctor Who as an alien James Bond. &&I don't know... I think it's because he may have become more introverted when he was older.

I only know, because my dad mentions him sometimes, they used to play pool together as my gran did his housework and cleaning in Great Missinden. Apparently he used to sit in his chair a lot with people inviting him out. 

Then again, my dad always refers to him as very sociable when he went out and so on. 

I will have a read of Going Solo when I get out of uni though, thank you :) &&IIRC Roald Dahl was an aviator, while Ian Fleming was a spy with his cousin, Christopher Lee, who was known for showing up to interrogations wearing a tuxedo, and may have been the inspiration for Bond.&&They were both spies, no idea if they were both airmen.&&You wrote a bad song, Petey.&&Now I want to watch Fantastic Mr. Fox.
&&https://media.giphy.com/media/7rj2ZgttvgomY/giphy.gif&&We don't talk about *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*.&&I think you're underselling his looks, charisma, and money.&&you need to read the books. Bond saw women as playthings prior to Vesper, she (and later Tracy) were always the exceptions to the rules. Bond in the books isn't painted so much as a straight womanizer, but as an extremely broken and empty person. He smokes, drinks, drives fast, treats women like shit because he doesn't care if he's alive or dead, and that's what makes him good at his job.&&Apart from the whole love em and leave em thing I can't think of any time Bond treats a woman poorly until AFTER they've already done the deed. You might have a few issues you need to work through if you think women love men who treat them like garbage.

Oh well.&&Lazenby, who had no real film experience, left bond after Ohmss was filmed but before released after being convinced by his agent that he would be typecast and pigeon-holed into that role forever. He also made alot of comments about how bad it was and how little control he had over the process (because he was a new actor, selected specifically because of his physique and looks as he came from modelling).

So he quit, and his career ended overnight, he found no real work for at least a decade or two and everyone forgot about him.

Bond girl*
&&Exactly. You get it. &&> Wouldn't it be crazy if bond became trans and had to kill himself because he's one of the Bond girls. 

&&I like the way his voice almost inaudibly cracks and slightly shudders even as he delivers what otherwise would be a horribly cold and unfeeling throwaway line.&&I hate martinis. They're wet and they spill everywhere.&&Did you ever hear the tragedy of George Lazenby the Groom?&&Treason? Have you lost your mind, Arthas?
&&Well, someone convinced him of that, and he listened. &&It's really interesting to think about how Bond has been influenced by the culture around it at the times the various films were made. That's actually a way less obvious one. There's also:

* Cold War influence on the first 30 years or so of Bond movies almost too obvious to mention.
* Moonraker clearly getting some sci-fi influence from Star Wars (although the original script is way older)
* License to Kill being heavily influenced by Miami Vice.
* GoldenEye dealing with Bond in a post-Cold War world.
* Casino Royale has Bond stopping terrorism in a post-9/11 world and is also said to be heavily influenced by the Jason Bourne movies.&&You mean Craig can actually act, unlike almost all the other Bonds.&&How about we just ignore Spectre?&&M seemed pretty different between Brosnan and Craig. 

With Brosnan, she was kind of a typical boss, who had a bit of disdain for the 007 program in particular. She felt (early in Goldeneye anyway) technology could replace field agents. 

Craig's M is an ultra hard ass who personally dislikes 007 at first because he's a rhinoceros where she feels an agent needs to be suble. &&To be fair to you in You Only Live Twice he's still mourning his wife's death 9 months later and his little jaunt to Japan is intended to be a rebound trip for him (M even says as much). 

IMO part of the reason You Only Live Twice is such a bad novel is Fleming was a melancholy old bastard on his deathbed while writing it, it's dark and claustrophobic and deals quite a lot with the decline of England as a world superpower after WWII. And it was written after Dr. No came out and took character cues from the movie, so in the novel he's much more Sean Connery than Fleming Bond. As a result it feels phoned-in and not very Fleming styled at all.

Man, after reading almost the entire series, I'm comfortable in my opinion that all of it is pretty masturbatory chauvinist tripe.

Anyways .. y'know I honestly never even thought of the two of them as gay.  I really just kind of thought of ""man-child"" killers.  Like Humpty and Dumpty or something.

I admit I am not a Bond-fanboy, but I have still seen YOLT probably 4 or 5 times over my life.

 In the books Fleming makes it clear he adores cars, goes into in depth descriptions of them and often uses extremely rare models that even other gear heads might not be familiar with. My favorite is ~~Al~~ Felix Leiter's personal car, a ""Studillac"" which was a low volume Studebaker with a conversion kit that included a large Cadillac V8 and performance rear end and transmission.

Just like to point out. &&Our gold mine has collapsed!&&I mean Dalton pretty much did the same thing and laid down the blueprint for Craig. And Lazenby a bit too, but Lazenby wasn't a good actor. The other Bonds were doing what the role called for at the time, which was a less grounded and more male fantasy based approach. I don't think Connery, Moore or Brosnan are bad actors, but they were in movies without a lot of emotional beats, that were more spectacle and comedy than a character study of why Bond is Bond. There's a few moments in their runs where they do have to be more than just suave, and they pull it off usually. Brosnan's were the worst tonally though, followed by Moore's. Brosnan's often mixed seriousness in camp in a way that was just confusing, probably making it hard for him to sell either.

It's kind like Tom Holland versus Tobey. Both are fine, but Tom seems like a more Roger Moore-ish version, fun and light-hearted, and Tobey is more of a Dalton, where he has quips and silliness but there's some pain under all of it. Neither are bad, just suited for their particular incarnation.&&IMO Goldeneye is still better than any of the Craig films, but Brosnan started getting fed shit scripts after that. &&>To be fair to you in You Only Live Twice he's still mourning his wife's death 9 months later and his little jaunt to Japan is intended to be a rebound trip for him (M even says as much).

That is true. 

>it feels phoned-in and not very Fleming styled at all.

I totally agree. 

>Man, after reading almost the entire series, I'm comfortable in my opinion that all of it is pretty masturbatory chauvinist tripe. Lucky he writes such compelling action and political intrigue because everything else about the books constantly turns me off from his writing.

All of it? Definitely The Spy Who Loved Me. I mean, it's just really transparent. It's like Fleming wanted to prove that he knows how women think and/or boast about what a great lover he is and why. I cringed a lot while reading it. The good news is that it's easy to skip in the series without missing out on anything. 

He is definitely a chauvanist.....and a racist and homophobic and very vain. 

One thing that surprised me when I picked up the Bond series is that Fleming really does have a way with the written word. And on top of that, it is subtle. He has a light touch. All in all, it is an easy read. He doesn't strike me as a perfectionist or particularly self-conscious, which allows him to develop the characters and tell the story with a lot of freedom. I especially found #2 through #4 in the series enjoyable reads. &&[deleted]&&You're right. I'll admit that I'm assuming the two are meant to be gay, but that's because they're certainly not straight, and they're not exactly portrayed as sexually ambiguous. This movie came out in 1971 and for the next 30 or so years, you could make a comedic moment in your film based solely on the fact that gay people are there and they're SO quirky and weird. Couple that with the fact that the source material is written by a guy who like I said earlier, really dislikes gays, I think it's a safe bet that these characters are meant to be homosexuals.

It doesn't make sense in regards to film continuity (how would Blofeld not recognize Bond after their face-to-face meeting in You Only Live Twice?), but taken on it's own, it is one of the absolute best in the franchise.

  &&Some women do. I've seen guys trash girls all the way into the bedroom and it's just sad for both parties.

I love that M sends Bond to rehab after his love of alcohol and women starts impacting his missions. 

Yeah, I don't know... the vain-ness of it all is a huge turnoff. England is the best and he has to remind you at least once a chapter, from the food and drink and cigs (seriously fleming has almost a fetish for english alcohol and tobacco) to infrastructure to the people. And bond's smug bewilderment at about any other culture got old so fast. It gets a little Mary-Sue-wish-fulfillment for me, even with the attempts to show Bond is flawed. At times it's like fleming is writing a fanfiction about a superhero named EnglandMan who travels the world being Properly English, bangs the hottest women, plays the best cards, drinks the best drinks, drives the nicest cars etc. etc. He could really have done with a small pinch of self awareness. 

The novels themselves are fairly formulaic too. His characters, well his male characters, are his strong suit IMO. He writes really good action. It's definitely an easy read. 

But then like. Just the way he describes japanese people (or to use his verbiage ""exotic orientals"") makes me cringe hard. Everyone and everything is a stereotype the highest degree. &&Man, Sean Connery is not a good actor but he exudes cool.&&Hahaha! Okay, fair enough.

Edit: Correction, Quantum of Solace was in [""For Your Eyes Only""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(short_story_collection\) ), not Octopussy.&&Quantum of Solace just means ""degree of comfort"" or ""amount of relief"".

Yes, Archer did parody this plot point.&&I'd call it one of the best bond films! It's quite possibly the most personal Bond film &&I think Lazenby gives a good performance.

Like, Connery is the unarguable best, Lazenby sucked because he was only in one film and wasn't an 'actor', Moore is too silly to be liked, Dalton sucked because he was in two films, etc. etc.

I never followed the common code there.

Eh...

Not Fleming's M.  He was a taciturn, no-nonsense, boss.  M calls Bond 'James' perhaps only one time in all of Fleming's work.  Usually it's ""007.""  M is never depicted outside the office, and I'm not sure he's ever shown drinking.  There's no trace of Malory's  histrionics in M.

You can see this in Moonraker where M criticizes Bond for many of his food and drink choices, as well as several places throughout the novels where Bond acknowledges that his taste differ from high society but high society-be-damned. 

And yet, many of Bond's habits have been adopted as the epitome of class! I think a big part of this is the portrayal of Bond in the movies presents him as the pinnacle of sophistication (contrary to the novels) but keeps a lot of the details of the novels intact. 

The ""shaken not stirred"" thing is one example. The use of vodka instead of gin in his Martinis is another (vodka is more or less flavorless and makes for a rather uninteresting cocktail). I mean, American Martini culture basically shaped itself around these two modifications, which could easily be described as Ian Fleming either giving a middle finger to tradition or trying to differentiate himself from high society or both. &&Almost every Bond movie has little to do with the original Flemming story.

The second half of the movie probably is my favorite part of all the James Bond films. As a whole, I'd say it's on the bottom-end of the top-tier Bond movies. &&You, my friend, have good taste.

Pretty good poster too.&&This movie genuinely scared the shit out of me, when all the house hold appliances start turning on and the baby gets sucked out the dog door, WTF MAN!&&Bawm bawm bawm....&&I'm glad it's re release instead of a remake. &&BAAAAARRRRRYYYYY!!!!&&I'm guessing this is US only?&&He says the sun came out last night!&&I have always wanted an opportunity to ask this question:

What are the first two kinds of close encounters?&&Man this movie brought back memories.  Mom had bought the lunchbox, I was so excited.  But when I got to my religious school they forced her to wallpaper the outside of the box.  I don't even remember the pictures, but I can still see that nasty wallpaper material that covered my beloved lunchbox. What a sucky thing to do to a little kid!&&This means something...&&""Everywhere Sept 1"" - anywhere to buy tickets? Not listed at fandango or cinemark&&Will it have the R2-D2 Easter egg though?&&Would much rather see a 35mm print than a 4K remaster &&This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I'm so excited!&&Goddamn, I didn't even know this was happening. Guess I'll remind myself to see it for the first time on the 1st.&&I always think of ELO when I see any pictures of the spaceship from close encounters &&Wow, saw this in theaters at 10 with my parents and it totally convinced me that aliens were real. And friendly. Seems like most of the alien movies after that, were aliens who wanted to destroyed everything. (Starman and ET being the exceptions).&&Please let this get a Blu-ray release similar to Jaws. &&This is what they should be doing instead of reboots&&Thank God it isn't a reboot/remake/sequel.&&The blue and orange re-coloring looks awful on this.&&The last scene of this movie genuinely made me lose the breath. When the tall lanky alien descends from the craft and when the ship flies off and you see it in it's entirety. It was unnerving and just straight up  awe-inspiring.  The editing, music and buildup was just perfect. &&Woah. I would LOVE to see this on the big screen. How do I find out if this is screening anywhere near me?&&Great, let's bring back all the nightmares from my childhood.&&I love this movie with every old fibre of my being. The theatre experience is a MUST for any movie buff. &&Is this real! Oh my fuck!!!&&Meh.  They're making a mountain out of a mash hill.

:D&&This may be a stupid question. But what are Close Encounters of the first and second kind?&&FORTY years?!?!??? Nah, that can't be...omg.&&orange-blue strikes again&&Fun fact, the design of the spaceship in close encounters is based off of my high school, which Spielburg once attended. Arcadia HS in Phoenix. There used to be a mural of the school taking off into space in the old cafeteria before the remodel.

EDIT: I did some digging and found [this cool article](http://forward.com/culture/305981/close-encounters-of-the-arizona-kind/) about Spielburg's time in Arcadia. And [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ba/88/36/ba883678eff70fb5c53937093f7113dd.jpg) is what the inside of the circle looked like before the remodel.&&#BLUE AND ORANGE   
http://www.slashfilm.com/orangeblue-contrast-in-movie-posters/&&One of my favorite films of all time, can't wait for this. The opening scenes do a great job of sucking you into the film.&&I bet when Richard Dreyfus saw this poster he checked his own pulse. &&The synthesizer in that film (ARP 2500) had a major effect on me.  It got me into electronics, because I wanted to build a synth.  I built a lot of noisemaking things, and did a bit of stuff we would call ""circuit bending"" today, didn't call it anything in the 70s because I never met anyone else who even vaguely understood.  I could never really afford to build or buy a synth better than a small PAIA kit (which was utter garbage), but I lucked into *home computers* very early.  I learned programming and interface electronics because computers could make sound (by oscillating relays and intentionally causing controllable radio interference) and by the early 80s, actual polyphonic wave synthesis, and the ability to write audio to tape cassette.  It was an amazing and frustrating time, but fun to do stuff like running crappy RFI waves through crappy guitar effects and quarter inch tape, mixing  with sounds I could make with my voice (better than that damned PAIA), guitar, piano, etc.  Crazy times, had a lot of fun, and used some of that material in my university composition program.  Nobody understood, and I didn't understand that I was decades ahead of my time with my electronic music obsession (I was idolizing Raymond Scott, Bebe and Louis Barron, and Leon Theremin at the time).

Sadly, Phil Dodds the ARPist in CE3K passed away in 2007.  That was my gateway into synth, and nothing before or after had a larger impact on my life. RIP Phil, and *Re Mi Do Do So*.&&More re-releases, less remakes&&Pretty lazy design if you ask me. They got the whole teal and orange thing going, and the giant spaceship spectacle really makes it look generic. I think just revisiting the old lights on the road poster with maybe some tweaks would be nicer&&I've heard rumblings that this might have something to do with a massive disclosure effort on behalf of the US govt. Not trolling btw&&Fuck ! 40 years ?

 I was just a wee boy when my dad took me to see this . Oh the wonder that filled my little mind when I walked out of the cinema and looked up . I remember liking it more than Star Wars . 

I think I should take my dad this time .

Watch the skies ....&&Somehow Harrison Ford will star in this movie too.&&Close Encounters is better than E.T. by a country mile.&&Man I want more movies like this. Arrival was the closest thing to genuine awesome alien sci if. We need this in our lives. Amazing intenseness, not play by play action sci fi that I can map the entire movie out in 5 minutes.&&Who's going to Devils Tower, Wyoming to see this on 9/2? Alamo Drafthouse is doing an outdoor movie event at the tower. I'm going. &&*Re Me Do Do So*&&As someone who hasn't seen the film, I am stoked. Close Encounters managed to sneak by me all of these years. Close Encounters AND T2 within a couple weeks of each other? Sign me up!&&Wow. Spoilers on that poster or what? &&I’ve never seen this movie, mostly because I hold off watching great classics in hopes I’ll be able to see them on the big screen someday. I live in Canada and have a Cineplex (chain in Canada) by me but I feel we never get re-releases. Anyone in Canada that has a cineplex near them that gets re-releases?&&One of the first movies I ever saw as a young boy in theaters I absolutely love this movie. &&I literally watched this movie for the first time yesterday. Should've just waited for it to come back in theaters.&&No way! One of my favorite films, and I'll be able to see it in theaters. &&That would have been great on IMAX. &&Hmm.  That reminds me...

The bluray release of _Close Encounters_ was masterfully done, in that it let one pick from multiple versions, all arranged to be viewed on the same disc.

__BUT.__

Spielberg's personal cut of the movie had one thing that I absolutely hated about it: The credits used the __non-__ _When You Wish Upon A Star_ music.  What a waste!  That version of the credits _was_ available to see in one of the other versions, so why the heck not the official director's cut?  I guarantee you Spielberg preferred the Pinocchio theme, because it was his idea to begin with!

So now I wonder if this theatrical re-release will manage to get it right.&&Near perfect movie. &&Seriously? Has Hollywood just given up at this point?&&This movie was the first time I saw a bare female bottom. Memories coming back.....&&Ronnie, if I don't do this, THAT'S when I'm going to need a doctor.&&Have all the guns been turned into walkie talkies? &&...with all the guns replaced with walkie talkies!&&Are they ever going to explain what happened to that super tall lanky alien that comes out of the ship first at the end?

[It literally disappears.](https://youtu.be/aTo0BreQKZU?t=40s)&&The poster reminds me that I've always wondered if Spielberg intended to evoke the sense of awe and wonder of Moses' encounter with God on top of Mount Sinai (an event shared by all three Abrahamic faiths). Spielberg was raised in a Jewish household, and Encounters has some religious overtones at times -- so it seems not out of the question. ""When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance ... "" (Exodus 20:18)

Also his mother was a concert pianist and his father an electrical engineer involved with computers. I wonder if that played a role in the idea of using music (the electronic display in particular) as a kind of universal translator in the film. &&Three of my favorite movies are returning to theatres soon! This, E.T., and T2! This might just be one of the greatest couple months of my life &&One of my favorite movies of all time. The intro is by far one of my most favorite mystery-type vibes ever.

104 44 30     40 36 10&&Just visited the Devils Tower last week.

Corey Vidal anybody?&&A 40 year anniversary re-release in 1977 would have been for a film made in 1937. Those who remember 1977, just think about that for a minute or two, and despair.&&I would much rather have re-releases in theatres, instead of reboots/remakes. I saw Jurassic park in theatres when they re-released it in theatres, incredible, not only was it awesome because the special effects are as good as today's effects. But I never got to see it in theatres as a kid. Can't wait for T2 to be released in theatres. I wish they would re-release ghostbusters and the original 1990 TMNT I would probably cry if I could see that in theatres &&Nice I can finally see this film.&&DOO DOO DOOO DOO DOOOOOOOO&&The scariest part for me, is when the kid reaches into the wheelbarrow, and Dreyfus almost cuts his fingers off with the shovel.&&They're heerrre!&&Nice looking poster, but it's too much of a spoiler. I dont think it needs to avoid spacecraft, but that shot is too much for me. Need some subtly. &&All aliens will be replaced with walkie - talkies.&&Spielberg can just release his old movies whenever and they'll do better than most of the crap currently out there.&&Fuck off Henson!&&Where can we get more info?

I'd love to see it on the big screen&&i saw this when i was very young but I no longer remember it. seems interesting&&Oh wow I just watched the original movie a few days ago, will it be any diferent from the original ? Has it been confirmed ?&&Ive actually never seen this movie. 
I'll have to see it in the theatre. &&Anyone remember the south park episode about just this?&&Personally I've been very disappointed with every re-release I've seen... Due to the failure of updating the sound. I go into movies like Jaws or Sound of Music and the sound is absolute crap. It amazes me that they can't do a remaster of the soundtrack to provide full theater full immersion sound.&&re re re release.  this has happened with close encounters before. (1980). had extra bullshit scenes too.  not exactly a new idea.&&Great movie. I remember staying up late when I was 9 or 10 to watch it on the Disney channel. Back in the 80s, the Disney channel had a lot of great content after 8pm. Tron and Star Wars are what come to mind right now. I had no idea what was going on plotwise, but I loved every minute of it. Would the little boy come back? Why are all those animals near Devil's Tower dead? A few years later, I saw it again a few I understood the plot. It was a whole new experience all over again. I'll definitely be seeing this on the big screen. &&I think this could be good&&I was thinking of this movie just yesterday...&&Take some time to let the fact that they didn't remake this and are doing this instead.&&I had that poster, next to an [Empire Strikes Back](https://i.imgur.com/Rrnm6IT.jpg) one in my bedroom my entire life, until my parents redecorated well after I graduated college.  I was so excited to visit [Devil's Tower in Wymoming](http://i.imgur.com/wEWHszU.jpg) too.  I def will be seeing this in theaters again!    
Edit: wrong state
&&Love this movie. So we have Close Encounters, a new Blade Runner movie, and a new Star Wars movie within a few months of each other! Kind of cool that they used the Mothership and the Millennium Falcon in Blade Runner! (would be amazing if they've sneaked them into 2049 somewhere!).&&Never seen this. Always kinda wanted to. This will be the perfect opportunity.&&it's beautiful&&And whaddya know, it's the same as the original poster. What a result. &&I once saw a scat porn parody of this entitled ""Close Encounters of the Turd Kind""&&Wait this is everywhere? Not just one of those Fathom Events things where the movie gets two days only?&&I hope they finally will add the never-before-seen alien/human examination scenes. Fire in the Sky this bitch up!&&Great looking poster.  Saw the film as a kiddo. This movie and Star Wars. Re-releases and remastered classics are great!  Even for Drive-ins.  If anything, re-release the director's cut of Blade Runner with the Vangelis soundtrack in theaters. &&Zey beelong here Mozambique&&""Digitally Remastered in 4K""

It was shot on film, which already had a resolution comparable to or greater than 4k (depending on metric, analogue to digital comparisons are fuzzy) - so what does this mean?

Should I expect unconvincing CGI touchups to already perfect practical effects? Uncanny- valley dwelling dewback horrors added to random shots? Guns turned into akwardly held walky-talkies?&&What a coincidence, headed to the devil's tower next  week. &&Now with more walkie talkies and CGI aliens! Also^Roy^shot^first. &&It would be great if there was the same image but without all the text. &&Uhh... this just made me feel old. 40th anniversary? smh...  

GREAT movie, by the way! I always think of Richard Dreyfus molding mashed potatoes into Devils Peak pretty much anytime I have mashed potatoes. Melanie Dillon was perfect as a mom trying to get her son back. 

Edit: devils peak xxxxx devils -tower-   😬&&I was an adult before I really thought about a specific character in this film. That brief moment where [the son has tears in his eyes, just looking at his father at the dinner table, who he believes is completely losing his mind.](#spoiler) It's damn near heartbreaking to think about what that kid is feeling, when you watch it. Such a damn good movie.&&When my kids were little, I taught them to make sculptures with their mashed potatoes and say, ""This means something. This is important.""

I thought it was hilarious. Their mother less so.&&First week of college one of the guys at the table did that in the cafeteria.  I knew I had found my people.  haha&&This is important...&&I don't get it...&&That's a BIG twinkie&&The day it opened I saw it twice. The second time I dragged my mother to it: ""You have got to see this!"" I was 23.&&I always thought it would be great if they could revisit this in a sequel somehow. I don't have an exact plot in mind, but after seeing *Arrival* do well, I think theatergoers are once again ready to see movies featuring non-aggressive aliens who aren't here to conquer or undermine us. &&Me too! I love when movies are re-released in theatres at anniversaries, especially when I wasn't old enough (or born) to see it the first time around.&&Its so great in a theater. I've managed to see it a couple times. I'll probably go again when this comes out.&&Saw it in drive-inn when I was 9 &&I wonder what version it will be. When I was ripping my DVD into my media server collection, there were 3 versions of the movie on the disc. There was a theatrical version and a director's cut version, and then a third version where the only difference I could find is the scene where they are out on the roadway, there is a billboard that has a McDonalds advertisement on it. One version omits that product placement and the other has it.&&Same here. I wonder what version it will be. &&That was the only way I could see it when I was twelve. My mom used to buy me copies of Science Fiction Analog at the supermarket. Star Wars was not my cup of tea because it was too Buck Rogers. But Close Encounters and Alien both were utterly fascinating to me. They still are, in fact.

And Terri Garr was such a babe. Melinda Dillon, too.&&are you going too&&I did when I was a kid and it first came out. I was *great* as I remember.&&It's going to be the Director's Cut, not the Special Edition, so the ending will be the same as the original theatrical version. Only the Special Edition has the extended ending.&&I want to see those confiscated pictures!  Also, I had no idea that men in black referenced the 'Venus refracted off the fog' thing.  Funny.&&So they were told they were looking at Venus but still had their photographs confiscated? Fuck the government. &&Cool article, thanks for sharing. &&I feel like that actual story would make a great film. &&On the few occasions I've had to go to Ohio I always blurt out ""That's Ohio!  That's a quarter!""&&I can certainly believe they were chasing Venus. I was out stargazing once, took a nap, woke up, and I saw an *incredibly* brilliant light to the east. I honestly thought it was an airplane with its landing lights on, that's how bright it seemed. Then I remembered the star chart I had studied earlier that night said that Venus would appear as a morning star, and sure enough, that's what it was. The human mind is perfectly capable of suggesting all the other details that made the police officers think they were chasing something other than a planet.&&And the whole cast digitally replaced by Ewoks! &&How bout I take this bunch of people to go free hat, while you guys go do the other thing?&&You beat me to the punch&&[deleted]&&I wish I could be in your shoes. The cast was amazing, the music and sound editing were amazing, the story, All of it. Go, Go see it. 

It is one of those 100 movies you must see before you die. &&Wuub wub wub WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB!

You'll get it. &&It's really good.  Please post back with your review on it!&&You might be disappointed. While the film still looks good to this day, I feel like those who watched it when it first came out appreciate it more.&&You're going to love it. Spielberg in the 70's was amazing!&&Same. I know the soundtrack, but never saw the movie. Similarly, can't wait to see T2 in a theater since I missed it the first go around, and by missed it, I mean wasn't born yet.&&This is a perfect case study in the overuse of teal and orange. This poster evokes the original but seemingly for no reason has a half orange half teal layer pasted over the top.

The shame is, I do think this new poster looks appealing because it is a nice pair of complementary colours. But I know the reason it looks like that is cynical business focused behavioral engineering, therefore it's kinda ruined for me.&&The overuse of that color scheme completely wrecked several movie posters for me, including this one. Who the hell makes these?!&&> orange

Reminds me of the re-release trailer for Jurassic Park a few years back. Thankfully, IIRC they didn't mess with the color in the actual movie, just the trailer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IesovZQR4g&&Its just like the original, only more orange and teal, and the 5 note sequence is now just a BRAAAAAAM.&&While I agree it's a bit too much here, it does pull right from the [30th anniversary release](https://www.amazon.com/Close-Encounters-Third-Anniversary-Ultimate/dp/B000VECAD0/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501029928&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=close+encounters+of+the+third+kind+blu+ray+30th+anniversary) from a decade ago. So, at least consistency?&&only September 1st ? My birthday is September 2nd and I really would want to see it for my bday&&Toys!&&Saw this when I was six.  Was totally not OK with it.  That kid looked just like me.

Can you please explain it like I'm five?  I saw the re-release of Blade Runner on 70mm back in 1992.  Showing in 4K sounds like a money grab for 4K format TVs&&> 35mm

Agree 100%.  This is an absolute downgrade.  I think the problem is that theaters have done away with film projectors.  But advertising as ""Remastered in 4K,"" just tells me we're getting downgraded picture quality then the original release.&&The ELO logo/spaceship is actually based on a [Wurlitzer jukebox speaker.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/62/04/ab/6204ab74b0f02dec306d2dc40249d04b.jpg)&&That's actually a big choice that Spielberg made for the film. Almost all alien movies before and since show them as hostile, while he decided with Close Encounters and E.T. to have an optimistic view &&For everyone who hasn't watched the 100th Universal Studios anniversary release of Jaws on Blu-ray, please do. The reworking of the film is insane. Virtually all blemishes and scratches are removed. Color has been touched up in many of the shots. The definition of picture is also amazing considering the film stock and equipment they had at the time. The picture is so clear, you can actually see white sails from sailboats on the horizon that Spielberg so diligently tried to avoid in the background. 

If not for the clothing and hairstyles, you could swear it was filmed only a few years ago&&The trailer says blu-ray and 4K ultra HD sept. 19&&I imagine the actual color correction in the movie won't be like this. It's good looking for a poster, but Spielberg isn't going to let somebody screw up the color in his film. &&What colors are you thinking?&&I think be patient, it says ""everywhere"" but I haven't found it listed anywhere yet.&&Same! Even though I love the film, two of the aliens at the very end still scare the shit out if me every time I watch it.&&First kind = sighting;
Second kind = physical evidence;
Third kind = contact&&First is just a UFO sighting, Second is evidence of a sighting left behind like when people complain of nausea or burns after an event, I guess and a scale actually goes all the way to Seventh which is when you make a baby with the alien.

But when I was a kid I thought ""third kind"" referred to aliens themselves, so in my mind encounters of the First kind were just interactions with people, and encounters of the Second were with animals (terrestrial beings other than humans) and just believed that because it made enough sense to me.&&Yeah man, we got old...
&&FYI If you every want to see it up close, the [National Air and Space Museum has the model.](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/model-spacecraft-mother-ship-movie-close-encounters-third-kind) *Lots* of easter eggs on that thing.&&I went to AHS too...came here to see if anyone mentioned it :-) Go Titans. Or something, I didn't play sports 😝&&Why would they get rid of this mural if it helped inspire such a famous film? Are there any pictures of it? &&Left out the cool fact - Phil Dobbs was the audio engineer in charge of hooking up the synthesizer, Spielberg thought he fit the bill for the role in the movie, and cast him on the spot. He even got a close up! Like discovering plutonium by accident!&&I was six and my dad died before this movie came out. A cousin took me. Take your dad. And give him a hug and tell him how lucky you are.&&I've never seen the movie. SAY IT AIN'T SO&&That one freaked me the hell out. You'd be afraid to shake hands with it or something cause you wouldn't want to snap an aliens hand off like a twig on you first meeting with their species.

I give Steven credit that he wholly acknowledges that was a dumb move. 
&&That scene was even parodied in UHF&&This is one of those things that I do whenever I have mashed potatoes, but usually the people I'm eating with don't get the reference and I feel about as awkward as Richard Dreyfuss did in that scene. Which makes the move more real and relatable in a way&&Can confirm, that is hilarious.&&That's how it starts &&Ha! I taught my kids to say ""good joeeearbbb"".  My wife thinks it's weird.&&I saw that (and started doing that) from UHF long before I saw close encounters. 

I couldn't stop myself from laughing when I recognized the reference in Close Encounters for the first time.&&You sir am a good parent. &&...What about the Twinkie? &&Did you see Jaws in theaters too?&&How's 63, gramps?&&We don't need a sequel to a movie like this, just another film with the same general idea. Interstellar is not a sequal/reboot/remake of 2001 but it has a lot of similar plot/story lines. &&No nO no.... no sequel please.  No sequel could ever do this film justice.  Even the cut that shows the inside of the ship was too much, they eventually got rid of that  for official releases.

This is a classic case for a film that absolutely should never be touched again, no sequels, no remakes, no re-imaginings.  It's perfect as it is.&&[Project Serpo](http://serpo.org/) would make an excellent sequel.

This is a straight up conspiracy theory, but a compelling story nonetheless. In a nutshell, this movie is supposed to be based on real events, except the contact event didn't occur in Wyoming, but on a deserted atoll in the Pacific Ocean controlled by the US Air Force. Supposedly a 10-year alien exchange program, which could be the group that went on the ship that Dreyfus' character followed. The story would be cantered on that group, which is chronicled in detail on this website.

The story is quite fascinating. You just have to be willing to tolerate the fact that the authors really believe what they're saying.&&Funny you mention wanting a sequel, just a few days ago I was thinking about this movie (one of my absolute favs) and E.T. and thought how it would be fun to do a follow up piece.

Rough outline in my head is that by the mid-1980s, Roy Neary's oldest son has grown up a bit and is trying to figure out what happened to his dad, but continually runs into classified brick walls.  Eventually, he gets a tip that he should check out a small town in California to meet with someone who had an encounter of their own, a young man named Elliott.

In my mind, CE3K and E.T. take place in a single ""Friendly Universe"" created by Spielberg.  I think it would be really interesting to put characters from the two stories together.  Maybe ""Keys"" worked on the Mayflower Project with Dr. Lacombe at one point.  There are a lot of parallels and connections that would be fun to explore.&&So, Caccoon (1985)? :P&&My 10 year old daughter fell in love with Close Encounters on a trip to  Devils Tower and LOVES Arrival. No point just agreeing that these two movies definitely have something in common and more movies like them have a place in cinema.&&Arrival = SO good.&&or have sex with our women...&&what about all that butt-diddling that these aliens are prone to?&&Watch the fourth kind&&It's going to be just like the original, but with Ewoks.

Edit: God dammit I hate myself for being such a skeptical bastard.&&People are all ways ready to see something good. &&2 Close 2 Encounter﻿&&Now I want someone to come up with a sequel idea! There's potential there and I agree! As much as enjoy movies like Independence Day, films like Close Encounters and Arrival are great in different ways!&&Didn't they do that in that Will Smith movie? &&that third version was the one where they ""go inside"" the mothership i believe?&&Can you explain the difference?&&Where the heck are the FOIA requests on this.

I didn't really care for it too much.  Maybe I just looked past something deeper that was there, but it just wasn't for me.  I love space/alien discovery films, but not fond of this one.  I see that is is pretty much loved by everyone who ever saw it, so I will probably be watching it again this weekend to see if it changes my mind.&&My first time seeing it was on cable TV in the late 90's or something and it still blew my skirt up. &&Isn't it just color theory? &&You're overthinking it. It's a poster for the rerelease of a successful movie, the filmmakers know it has an audience. Anyone who would go watch this today is already sold on it, there's no need for a group of producers and marketers to get together and design  the perfect poster that will manipulate people with behavioural engineering to go watch it.

Someone designed it with the lighting over-saturated because it looks pretty.&&everyone in the promotions departments of pretty much all movie studios.

its a thing now.

few are the movie posters without the blue/orange.

heck, take a look at the whole mad max movie. orange(ish in some cases), blue or a combo.


alllllllll the way through.&&The Marketing Dept.

Focus group says they like it. MORE TEAL AND ORANGE &&It isn't just posters - pause many movies made in the last 5 or 10 years and any given frame is just orange and teal. Every scene is tweaked so that all you can see is fucking orange and teal, and the other colours are desaturated to shit. It drives me insane. It works for some films (tbh if you aren't aware of the trend then most of the time you don't notice) but some movies really overdo it.&&Consistency across the majority of blockbusters from the last 20 years.&&Nah, you got a week to see it.&&Mine's around then too.

&&> Close Encounters of the Seventh Kind : The creation of a human/alien hybrid, either by sexual reproduction or by artificial scientific methods

Firstly I didnt know it went up to 7. Secondly, this 7th one is probably made into a porn movie somewhere.&&I mean, isn't that essentially true of all moments in my life?&&It's like listening to a an .mp3 vs. an analogue record.  An .mp3 compresses sound, and loses information, whereas an analogue record retains all the original audio information.  
  
A digital 4K remaster is a compressed image, whereas a 35mm picture has zero compression and retains all of it's photographic information.  
  
&&It is hands down the best Blu-ray I have ever watched. &&Is it just the Blu ray version on amazon? I'd like to buy it&&For what it's worth, the Blu-ray actually has a sailboat digitally removed from the film, as well as a wire holding up the buoy at the beginning. Despite these minor revisions (which I wish hadn't been done), the Blu-ray is great, and includes the original mono audio, which you should use instead of the surround sound remix (the remix censors the climactic line, ""Smile, you son of a bitch!"")&&Let's not get carried away. Why would you even need to rework it? Just scan, repair damage (if any) and grade to reference. It's not *that* old and probably doesn't suffer from any serious fading. 
The stock it was shot on was much beloved for its colour rendition 
and the lenses (Panavision C series) are still in use today on many productions.

The bluray, as far as I know, it's a relatively respectable effort by Universal's standards (which used to be pretty low). Some say it may have a touch too much DNR and the colour is maybe not spot on either.&&Right, but I want it to get the same treatment that Jaws got. &&The spaceship in the movie is cool blue-white and only the dots sources of light are yellow. So maybe, you know, the *real* colors, like on the soundtrack cover:

Not gonna believe that either.&&Hah crazy two Arcadia alums showed up in these comments! I happen to be wearing my old AHS football shirt today too.&&They remodeled the entire campus while I was a student there finished around 08 or so. I guess it just didn't fit their artistic vision anymore. The new campus still looks a little like the ship, but not nearly as much.

EDIT: oh to be clear the mural was after the movie. The ship design was inspired by the circular architecture of the school itself. The main building was a two story circle and all rooms faced the interior of the circle. In the center of the circle was the library. &&The whole school was torn down and rebuilt about 10 years ago, it was in pretty bad shape. I'll check my yearbook and see if there's a picture in there.&&Duh! You are right.

The best thing about being old is it if I tighten my belt a little bit I can afford to have a punk like you murdered and still have enough to retire comfortably in the cabin.&&Groovy - my right foot hurts today. Thanks for asking.&&The first film I saw by myself in a theater was Goldfinger&&Agreed. Smart filmmakers with original scripts, ideas, and visions way more appealing than forcing a sequel 40 years later. &&You aren't interested in what Richard Dreyfus character was doing all that time on the spaceship?  It's not like they came millions of lightyears just to A-probe the guy.&&Except interstellar was garbage and made no logical sense from a philosophical or scientific perspective. &&What.  What the fuck does Interstellar have to do with 2001?  There are no aliens in Interstellar - only future us.  There's no obelisk like devices anywhere in Interstellar.  There's no moons of Jupiter stuff going on.  There's no mind broken AI.  There's no starchild.  The humans of 2001 didn't leave earth to found a new colony elsewhere due to limited resources.  Etc etc.   


Why does everything have to be perceived through the lens of soft reboots?&&My God, I couldn't agree with you more. Hollywood is so bereft of original ideas that nearly 2/3 of larger budget films are remakes, reboots, or sequels. And millennials eat that shit up because they've grown up with this as the norm. Fuck that trend. Not every great movie should be treated like a franchise.

Here's my pitch, though:

It's set in 1977, two days after the encounter at Devils Peak. The spaceship returns the human explorers to Earth. Off steps Roy, played by elderly present-day Richard Dreyfus, returned from a journey that spanned over forty years from his perspective.

He addresses humanity with a message a brought from the edge of the cosmos, presumably about the importance of mashed potato sculptures.&&now that would be an interesting movie, humanity's response to first contact and how society adjusts, with less fantasy elements seen in arrival and contact and no evil aliens&&I like it. Especially having it set in the same universe as ET. &&Funny you should say that. E.T was born out of a planned sequel to Close Encounters called [Night Skies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Skies) Rick Baker has posted production photos of the aliens to his Instagram in the past.&&In this story of yours, do they team up with a now very disturbed young man named Robbie Freeling who always talks about his sister Carol Anne and her visit to the TV People? &&Fuck E.T.! That movie was scary as shit and it has been since I saw it as a kid. 

Source: gave me nightmares for years and still does. Made me pee my pants countless times. Am Traumatized. ಠ_ಠ&&No.  No more sequels.  No more universes.  These movies have stood for decades on their own merits.  They don't need to be franchised like that to be ""improved"".  They told the story they wanted to tell, and there's something beautiful about that.  It's ok that they ended, every story needs an ending, so let's leave them as is.&&They would take them way out into space, in the middle of nowhere, where the women would then sleep with them because of, you know, the implications. &&What did you think of the *Independence Day* sequel?&&Spielberg ran overbudget and couldn't finish filming everything, so the theatrical cut is incomplete.

After the success of the movie, the studio gave Spielberg the budget to shoot the rest of the scenes he'd planned, under the condition that he extend the ending, showing what happens after Richard Dreyfuss boards the mother ship. This aided in advertising for the Special Edition re-release.

In the 90s(?), Spielberg went through all the footage and created a ""Collector's Edition,"" which restored the original ending and polished the editing throughout. It's kind of a hybrid of the theatrical and SE - there are scenes that are only in the theatrical and scenes that are only in the SE, but I don't think there are any scenes in the Director's Cut that aren't in either TC or SE.

When the movie was released on DVD later on, all 3 versions were included and the Collector's Edition was renamed the Director's Cut.

Overall, I think the Director's Cut is the best overall version. I don't like the added SE scenes on the mothership at all, and while there are some TC scenes I like that aren't in it, they're not exactly important.&&http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=101920

There are a few short scenes altered or missing, but the most memorable difference is that the Director's cut and the original theatrical release don't show the scene where [Dreyfuss' character goes into the spaceship and you can see the interior](#spoiler) (spoiler for a 40 year old movie).&&Be the change you want to see in the world 🌈&&It's things like that that help us weigh such claims. If I had what I thought were compelling photos that had been confiscated by the government, or if those were my father's photos and I trusted him when he said he really shot them, I'd damn well file an FOIA request.

It's like that couple in McMinnville, Oregon, who claimed they photographed a UFO back in the 1960's. ""Oh my god, honey, look at that!"" ""Jesus, I that's incredible, lemme get the camera!"" *click, wind, click, wind...* ""Gosh honey, that was amazing, let's get these pictures developed right away!""

**""No, I don't wanna waste film, I'm going to put the camera back in my desk until we've used up this roll.""**

I'm dramatizing, but this is precisely what they did. They took pictures of what they claimed to be the single most important event of their lives...*and were worried about wasting film!?* **THIS** is all the ""checksum"" we need to measure the accuracy of their claim. And if the eyewitness who claimed he took extraordinary pictures which the government confiscated did *not* file a FOIA request, nor his relatives, that's all the ""checksum"" we need to measure the accuracy of his claims. If it were me, or the father I trusted, I'd have photocopies of the filing ready to gleefully shove under the noses of anyone who doubted me, plus an affidavit from the lawyer who filed it, any government records or transcripts relevant to the filing, and on and on and on. 

You don't have to do squat to get the gullible to believe your crazy story. You have to do a tremendous amount of homework to even hope to prove there's a particle of truth somewhere in your crazy story.&&You've got a tape recording of the sound? A thermograph? Of course not. Eyewitness testimony is fraught with mistakes, lies, confabulations...there are endless reasons to mistrust it, years after the fact, when handed down orally, *and particularly in light of other dubious claims by the eyewitness* (such as we saw near the end of the article). Not wishing to hurt the feelings of the eyewitness or his son is the worst reason of all to trust such testimony. 

As Carl Sagan said, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" I said I mistook Venus for an aircraft with its landing lights on. It's a ho-hum claim for which I needn't provide evidence because literally *anyone* can wait for a morning where Venus will appear as a morning star, set their alarm clock for an early hour, and see for themselves. Venus is astoundingly brilliant, particularly when your eyes are dark-adapted, as mine were when I woke up from that nap.

Nor, in light of what we now know about psychology and perception, is it terribly surprising that prosecutors want expert testimony based on scientifically analyzed evidence (y'know, all that ""CSI-type"" stuff), not merely eyewitness testimony when trying to convict someone of a crime. The details that ""throw you off"" are precisely the sort of details a charlatan will invent, knowing it adds verisimilitude to his story. And the first person a charlatan lies to could well be *himself,* unwittingly. From that point on, he might well think he *is* telling the truth.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&&It took me a third but then I encountered the joke&&Great film, but I think he is talking about Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&&But that Mila Jovovich is one hot piece of ACE!

&&See Jaws 99 times.&&Do do do DOOO DOOO&&As movies go it's not that impressive on it's own but it had a very specific time and place. It created a narrative of something that was kind of dying off at the time, the idea that the universe is generally a good and welcoming place and despite all the politicians and all the generals we could somehow find a way to unify as a species and rise above all that. It's a pretty strong message to send to the world. 40 years later I think people mostly know that if E.T. is watching us as a race they're staying the hell away until we get our shit together.&&My dad made me watch it, also around a year ago. I didn't really like it. It felt like the entire movie was building up to something, but then that something was so underwhelming that I didn't even realize that was what the buildup was for.

Someone mentioned Mad Max and it works great for that one, but it's a true delight to see movies with other color palettes such as Moonrise Kingdom or The Secret Life of Walter Mitty... A shame so many resort to easy color schemes when natural color schemes can be just as, if not more, captivating.

It might be 40 years for Dreyfus but it's like 700 years on planet Earth, or maybe more. I'm not a scientist.

If you're young and grew up with the new style (that tends to be more visceral, engaging, fast-paced on average imo) then some older classics will just seem boring and slow to you.  &&I totally understand you. It's an age thing for sure, as fuddy duddy as it sounds.

Movies these days have a lot more spectacle and a lot less subtext than they used to.. back in the day they had to do a lot more with just words and connotation simply because there wasn't anything else they could afford (or had the technical means) to do. 

Plus people were more used to longer, slower stories. Nowadays everything is much faster and less time is devoted to deep thought and silence. Being able to watch and appreciate a slower paced film is a skill that it takes a while to nurture.

Plus, you'll get younger people to watch some older movie because everyone told them about how fucking amazing it was, and then when the young person says ""huh that was kind of boring and slow"" they get mocked for having shitty taste. That's not gonna make someone wanna appreciate movies like that.

You gotta go into it with a certain mindset, an almost deliberate embrace of slowness. 

Give the movie another chance some day... Really sit and watch and try to experience and imagine it and how the characters are feeling. Be an active participant rather than just an observer. Maybe you still won't like it, but hey, it's worth a shot (if only to understand all the cultural references that show up everywhere because of it).&&This was my opinion as well when I saw it recently for the first time. Show your dad Arrival and see what he thinks. That movie is all story with essentially no action and it's fantastic. &&I felt the same, yet disagree with your dad.

He uses it so often, and it's extremely effective. 

For example in Jaws, he intentionally didn't want to show the shark up close  (even though the model was fantastic) just because he thought it'd be scarier for the audience to project their imagination onto it. &&Even though I am very curious on what the origin of the aliens and their spacecraft is, its definitely better we never got to see inside. &&He was interviewed for a ""making of"" documentary.

  In the interview he was asked if there was one thing he could go back and change in the movie originally, what would it be.

Spielberg said he wouldn't have had Richard Dreyfus' character (Roy) get on the alien spaceship and leave with them.  

> ""I would never have made Close Encounters the way I made it in '77, because I have a family that I would never leave,"" he said in a 1997 making-of documentary. ""That was just the privilege of youth."" 

At the time he wasn't married and didn't have kids, but later he wished he could have gone back and changed things.  That was the only thing I remember from that interview, mainly because I had the same question when I saw the movie.  &&&&Come on though... It's not like he went to a strip club for the weekend, he went on an alien aircraft, to other galaxies. Pretty rare opportunity, can you really blame the guy?

But remember, that all happened a very long time ago. Apparently things have progressed in the Star Wars universe enough by the 20th century where they began exploring other galaxies.

In ET Elliot is playing with Boba Fett toys, and during Halloween some kid has a Yoda costume, meaning *Star Wars as a fiction exists in the ET universe*. But also when ET sees the kid in Yoda costume, ET walks to the kid and says ""home! home! home!"" or something, so Yoda's species is also real within the ET universe.

I have seen it more recently, still doesn't excite me that much.&&It's the whole crux of the plot, really: the conspiracy was about creating a human-alien hybrid (and not just giving birth to one, whoch the conspirators already knew how to do through their cloning facilities), that was Cassandra Spender -the cigarette smoking man wife.


The point of it was that once they knew how to turn humans into hybrids, the conspirators and their families would be tranformed, which would make them immune when the black oil virus will be released on december 2012 , carried by killer bees and cultivated on GMO Corn. The black oil (who was supposed to simply enslave man) would then use humanity as a way to reproduce and tuen them into grey.

But the whole plan was really a way for Bill Mulder and the Cigarette smoking man to buy time until they found a vaccine, using a barren version of the virus found on Tunguska, Russia, on old women in nursing home in Florida.&&This is really cool, thank you! &&Thank you for finding this!

They even bypassed the nonworking three mechanical sharks for some of it and shot underwater stuff with very  short people in Australia and real sharks.  It was only afterwards that they realized that not showing their monster worked to their benefit.&&And IIRC, the damn thing kept breaking so they couldn't use it as often as they'd like.&&Actually he was going to show the shark more. The shark, nicknamed ""Bruce"" barely worked, and with all the problems filming on the actual ocean (the film went waaaay, wayyy over schedule - Spielberg thought it was the end of his career), he had to improvise and that's where much of the final suspense of the film came from.

You know what isn't a joke? THAT FUCKING MOVIE. Jesus that movie gave me some nightmares... I think it's the best ""Aliens testing humans"" movie out there. I hate it so much and that's why I love it, because it illicits such a strong negative emotion from me, I know the movie was made well, and therefore I think it's good.&&Plus the taste would be very unpleasant.&&Artoo and C3PO are inscribed in the raiders tomb. 'long time ago' isnt as long as you think&&> But remember, that all happened a very long time ago.

That is what the title card tells us, yet we have reason to believe that is not actually the case.

The first reason is that in a (non-canon) comic Han flies to earth, crashes, and is murdered by native americans. only to have his body discovered by Indiana Jones (ha) 126 years later. making modern earth a few hundred years past the most recent star wars film at most.

But a piece of canon (for this universe) corroborating evidence is the fact that ET still recognizes Master Yoda from the children mask, enough so that he tries to illicit help from him. for that to be the case Yoda still has to be remembered, or even presumed still alive.

Given that second piece of evidence I would actually posit that ET happens *before* episode IV, possibly during the Clone Wars era, since any-time after that Yoda is living on a backwater planet presumed dead.

Given that, it seems likely that this is directly after the events of episode III, ET's species were a member of the Senate and presumably very force-sensitive given their psychic powers, so it is possible that they foresaw the destruction of the Jedi or at least predicted that things were going to turn sour with palpatine in charge and fled the galaxy to avoid persecution for their force-powers. This would explain why ET recognized Yoda (he was a hero in the clone wars, and one of the few people they may have hoped could stop Palpatine) and why his species was on Earth in the first place. (they were looking for a habitable but non-inhabited planet to live on in the new galaxy, moving on when they realized we lived here. (it is possible that earth-humans have no force-presence, like the Vuuzhan Vong, making manual inspection necessary)).&&If this could all somehow fit into the Mary Tyler Moore Show universe, I'd be sold.&&The force did it. It gave a vision to George Lucas or something, and over time as it faded he started making the special editions.&&I actually have never seen that movie. I've always wanted to, though.

But then again, I'm not capable of objectively reviewing it  &&Well it's implied throughout the movie his actions are partly influenced by the aliens.&&He *sorta* goes insane.  Roy Neary is a little boy trapped in a man's body.  *Pinocchio* (the story of a puppet that wants to become a real boy) is a consistent theme throughout the film.  Roy has a *Pinocchio* bobblehead, he offers to take the kids to see *Pinocchio*, there's a *Pinocchio* cartoon on the TV at one point, and most telling is that Disney *Pinocchio* theme (*When You Wish Upon a Star*) plays in John Williams' score when [Roy finally goes to the mother ship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYtSsBCYByk&t=0m24s) and we cut to the little boy who has just returned.

Instead of a puppet that wants to be a boy, we have a *man* who wants to be a boy.  He's full of childlike wonder and is *completely* open-minded.  This is why the aliens chose him.  He is free of prejudice and when the government tries to bullshit him, he sees right through it, and pulls some straight up childlike adventure moves.  Note that in the end, as *When You Wish Upon a Star* plays, Roy enters the belly of the whale-like ship... how much more *Pinocchio* do you need?

I think most people expected a science fiction film, but what they got was a Western film that had aliens in it. And the reason for having aliens is essentially to turn the Western film on its head. It's hard for European settlers and their descendants to understand what it is like to have a technologically advanced culture from afar come to plunder your people and your land. I think more people would have enjoyed the film with that sort of perspective. 

 Sure it had problems, but it really is fun. Watch it soon!

"The Matrix Was Behind Filming Schedule, They Did Not Gamble Their Budget on the Opening Scene (Proof in Comments)",26554,6ngmo8,https://youtu.be/FIJD4UotnrA,1021,1500134061.0,,"The video is from the 1999 DVD commentary and the voices you hear are Carrie-Anne Moss, visual effects supervisor John Gaeta, and editor Zach Staenberg (who won an Oscar for his work here).

  
The discussion is specifically about the shooting schedule, not the budget.  What happened was filming was set for a 90 day shoot, but they were falling behind schedule.  The Wachowski Brothers had them clean up the opening action sequence (add some touches, sound effects) and sent that over to the studio.  That ‘blew away’ the studio heads, who backed off about the schedule, and let them go over-schedule (ended up being 118 days).  There is nothing about a budget gamble of 10mil, and later on Staenberg even says that the original script called for Trinity to jump over the alley way while a train rushed underneath and that ‘the budget wasn’t an issue, we just couldn’t find any alleys in Australia that had a train running between them’.


The film was in pre-production for 4~ months (confirmed by Moss in the commentary), where all of the main cast underwent loads of training from martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping.  During that training, Keanu suffered a two-level fusion of his cervical spine, and had to have surgery.  As a result, they filmed most of his non-action scenes first.


This was the first action scene they filmed, but they did _not_ film the movie in order.  Several scenes were filmed before this one; ie, their entire budget was not put into this one scene.  


The original quote about the 10mil budget being gambled on the opening sequence seems to have started in 2008 (that’s the earliest reference I could find) on this site: http://www.matrixresolutions.com/index.html?page=behind_the_scenes


Around 2012-2013, the claim starts popping up on sites like Screenrant, along with clickbait sites that feature ’15 Facts You Didn’t Know About the Matrix’.  My assumption is, sometime between 2008 and 2012, someone edited the IMDB trivia section with the false information from the MatrixResolutions site, and other sites then scooped it up as official because it came from IMDB.
&&TIL not all TIL are true.&&I knew this smelled like movie lore b.s.&&Idk if anybody posted this, but that entire rooftop chase reused assets and the majority of the rooftop set from the film ""Dark City""&&Looking back that was indeed an incredible opening sequence to a movie.&&[deleted]&&That time between Reloaded and Revolutions *though*, before reddit there was (also) amazing internet discussion - I wish the young redditors could have experienced how deep and intense it was back in those more ""gentle"" days of actual fan forums - great times.&&I can't recall another movie where i was so invigorated coming out of. Didn't want it to end. Wanted to learn kung-fu. All of it. THE MATRIX was wildly exciting upon first viewing.&&This is the major problem with crowdsourcing info and current blog culture. On one hand it's great that everyone has a say, and many people have become active sharing knowledge through imdb, wikipedia, etc., but on the other hand, very inexperienced/underqualified people can just post shit, and if it does go unchallenged it becomes the new norm.

That's super scary, because there are just massive amounts of knowledge that are either so trivial or specialized that it creates a window to exploit (even if not intentionally) and gets rehashed on the myriad content-sharing websites.

I remember studying Anthro once, and I devised some possible migration rout for humans that would have accorded with all our literature and studies, and I thought damn, if I put this in writing it would seem super legit, and yet I totally made it up. Many seasoned anthro types would have fallen for it.&&fuck i love the matrix&&I wish people would post links to originals in these kinds of threads, for those of us who don't spend all day on reddit&&I JUST saw all 3 Matrix films yesterday for the first time ever. Coming from an Actors POV, I was really blown away by the action choreography. &&Carrie-Anne Moss's ass looks incredible in that outfit.  &&TIL it was filmed in Australia&&Movies are financed.  No movie gets all of the funds at the start of production.  You would be stupid to pay all of that interest from day one.    No producer would risk his career on such a stupid gamble.  And good luck on finding a bond company.&&Never heard this before. I love the first Matrix movie. The second movie I still would say I like for the crazy action in the middle. Hardly remember the last movie though.&&So, don't believe everything you first see on Reddit ? Gotcha.&&GODDAMN YOU, CYPHER&&Title gore&&Saw this post, stopped what I was doing and watched the matrix. That movie rules&&How was matrix not nominated for an Oscar that year? &&They went over schedule or budget, but they created the single best action move of all time. Seems worth it.&&There's a similar rumor that goes around in the anime community about the production of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The ending of the original TV series was rushed to meet production deadlines, which meant the director Hideaki Anno had to nix his original plan for a big apocalyptic ending. Instead, the studio reused as much animation as they could, did lots of still shots of characters speaking without any animation, and even used still photos with voiceovers. The result was an ending that was straight out of an experimental mixed media art school film that much of the audience just didn't *get* even though it blatantly spelled out all the character's psychological motivations in one of the most Freudian things I've ever seen.

To this day some people claim Anno and his studio ran out of money, but the truth is they spent so much time animating action sequences earlier in the series that they just didn't have the time to do a proper ending, and decided to go all postmodern instead to make the deadline. 

(EDIT: There was also meddling by the network execs, as /u/kiyoske points out, that meant they didn't have the funds to hire extra animators for the ending. Inasmuch as money was tight, it was due to the network, and not because Anno had squandered their budget as rumored. Incidentally, this was the second time Anno had been screwed by network execs, as his previous series Nadia had production issues as well.)

Arguably this made the series even more popular despite the fan outcry, because everyone wanted a ""real"" ending that wasn't a bunch of introspective psychological navel gazing. Evangelion was such a surprise success that Anno was given the funding to do a full-length animated movie, to make his true vision for Evangelion's ending. This became the ""End of Evangelion"", which ranks up with Akira as the most influential anime movies of all time.

On a related note, there's a similar rumor about one of Anno's early productions, Gunbuster (a direct to VHS series, or OVA as they're known in Japan). The sixth and final installment was entirely in black and white as a stylistic choice, and to this day some fans think this was due to a tight budget. In fact, animating in black and white and making it look good is actually really hard to pull off, because in reality you're animating in greyscale to replicate the look of black and white film. That kind of animation needs a team of very skilled animators, so Anno actually spent *more* for Gunbuster's finale to be black and white, not less.&&/r/titlegore&&Great detective work man&&I looked up about this to try to verify for myself and TIL that both brothers are now trans women. &&i want trinity to joi me&&Still the best movie ever made. &&I find it weird reading Wachowski 'brothers' now a days.&&That's the internet for you.

If your shooting schedule overruns from 90 days to 120 that's 30 additional days of paying dozens, maybe hundreds, of people more money. That's a significant extra cost. 

Maybe the exact rumour is wrong but the spirit - ""They put more of their money into the opening scene than originally budgeted and hoped the studio would like the result and fund the rest"" - sounds valid still.&&Love this movie. &&Thanks for compiling the relevant materials and setting the record straight, pretty solid info &&A two level fusion is the treatment, not the injury. They remove a damaged disc between the vertebrae and replace it with an implant. 

http://www.medicalexhibits.com/obrasky/2009/09063_02X.jpg

The damaged disc causes a shitload of pain, hence the reason for the surgery. Most people have damaged discs to some degree, they don't heal very well or at all due to really poor blood supply. Most people don't have symptoms. If everyone got an MRI tomorrow there would be a shit load of people with bulging, compressed, and herneated discs. They only cause pain when nerves get involved.  And then holy shit does it hurt.  The disc will bulge out (think of squeezing a water balloon) and that can push the nerve up against bone. (This is only one example)

It's called a fusion because the end goal is that bone grows all over and around the spacer implant and in a few years you basically have one mass of bone where there used to be two.  Actually, the rods and screws only hold things in place while this happens, after fusion is complete they are essentially just sitting there doing nothing. Obviously they don't bother to remove them. &&I wonder if the misinformation started as so much film industry misinformation, in that blogs written by people with no real perspective or concept of how things work misinterpreted a third hand account about the film going over budget because the studio saw this scene and allowed them to shoot an extra 28 days. On a film of that scale 28 days could easily be another $10mil in the budget. Film budgets are broken down by the day and on a big film it can cost over $300,000 a day. &&The more I look back the more I realize just how amazing the first film was. This series had the potential to be the Star Wars of my generation.&&People don't realize that 28 days over schedule is a big deal too. That's other movie that may need to film, other jobs people would be on, that's being a month behind on post production. It's a problem. Though the studio was confident they were making something compelling, interesting and most of marketable and working through these problems would pay off. &&Wow I had no idea you could potentially wrap up something like The Matrix in just 90 days.&&Wow, Keanu did seem very stiff in the first Matrix movie. 

I just assumed it was a quirk of the character acting but maybe there was more to it than that. I know from experience that an injured back affects your entire posture.&&> they did not film the movie in [chronological] order.

This is also evident by Neo's haircut in the movie.&&The second ""fact"" on that website is also verifiably untrue...  

>This is the first multi-media creation in human history, not to be confused with multimedia. The entire Matrix story is told not only in three movies (plus The Animatrix), but also in comics and video games.  

Many, many, many serial properties had comics/books/movies/TV shows/ radio shows telling a story decades before The Matrix. &&Great detective work man!

Isn't a spinal fusion a surgery, not a disorder?&&I know of 2 possible locations in Melbourne that would have sufficed for the shooting of the train under the trinity scene &&I guess you could say they took quite the ""Woo-ping""&&Yesh, it should have been pretty obvious the story wasn't true.

In addition to all the insane budgeting and scheduling logistics the studio rep on set would notice what they were doing. &&I never even heard this myth but it was an interesting read anyway, thanks!

Just a heads up before someone freaks out on you but it's probably better to refer to the former ""Wachowski brothers"" as just The Wachowskis now even though ""brothers"" was common at the time the Matrix was released. It seems like such a small thing but from trans folks, many of whom have to deal with people refusing to acknowledge their choice of gender expression, it seems like a bigger deal.

I pointed out why it would be impossible for the movie to cost 10m when Keanu was paid 10m up front and got downvoted. &&It doesn't even make sense. No way would the studio be like ""We gave you $10mil and you completely blew it on one sequence, we'll *definitely* trust you with another $80mil!""

Like even if they thought the sequence was really good, that's just a *stupid* thing for a studio to do.&&TIL has no gossip and rumor filter.&&Not to mention it's not a fancy looking opening..&&Unrelated, but I love your username. That movie is a gem.&&I always wondered which sets specifically got re-used.&&Oh cool never knew that was also shot in Aus.

Edit: Whoa, lots of responses. Looks like I know what to watch tomorrow night!&&That's cool to know. Love that movie. &&It also reused the opening sequence of Vertigo!&&They used a few sets from Dark City IIRC and I remember reading it was intentional. The Matrix borrows many things from Dark City. A' Chosen one"" or very unique individual(god like figure) who gets powers to warp reality(in an artificial ""earth"") is a similar theme in both as well as the question what makes us ""us""(is it our memories or something else)? Swap robots with aliens and its a very similar theme.

I loved Dark City but I remember it wasn't received well by the public(Did well critically I think). It was the Matrix before The Matrix. I just think for the regular public Dark City was a little too far out there at the time and the format was something I think turned a lot of people off.&&I mean, it did what it was suppose to, it really drew you into the movie in the first minutes. And the trailers they showed nothing, so I would say the majority of people had no idea what they were getting into at the time, which makes the intro all that more important to be compelling. Definitely not enough that could be said about the movie, simply a work of art. &&Something about The Matrix movies(yes, all of them) that I really think doesn't get enough credit is how so absolutely incredible the storyboarding was and how well that translated to the screen. You can pause in so many places and get iconic, interesting, dynamic stills that are packed with attention to detail in their composition, lighting, angles and lines...etc. It's a perfect blend of comic book nerd and movie nerd. &&It still is one of my favorite openings to a movie.&&It was like nothing we had seen before. &&I mean crazier shit **has** happened... but it looks like this specific instance was a myth.

If it wasn't for Steve ""Spaz"" Williams doing a t-rex CGI test and Mark A.Z. Dippé funneling him money without the studio knowing, Jurassic Park would have used stop motion with interpolation instead of CGI. From what I understand Williams literally peeled skin off the main t-rex to scan for textures without telling anyone.&&I remember that. There were a thousand theories floating around about what was happening and what might happen next. People were digging very far into religion and mythology to make connections and find influences in the story. I remember making a 6-8 page Word document collating all the Internet theories I could find and adding my thoughts and then distributing it amongst my friends. It was an amazing time, and I think it amplified my disappointment with Revolutions when it finally came. The internet had far better ideas than what the filmmakers came up with.&&I joined IMDb because of the matrix&&Was in high school when this came out.

I'm surprised he didn't include the epic final fight scene from 'Once Upon a Time in China' - with all its creative moves and dynamism.

Not ""run out of money"" but money was spent on animating scenes which were cut by executives or for political reasons ( a scene vaguely similar to the sarin gas attacks were set to air the week following the attack). If you're given 100k to animate an episode, you spend 20k animating a scene that gets cut, you have to spread the remaining 80k across the rest of the episode (purely example numbers). All of these financial reasons on top of GAINAX's infamous crunch-times and episodes being delivered to studios literally 11th hour, cause a lot of backup on the production line (can't start animating episode 22 because I'm still finishing a scene in 21, etc).

> This became the ""End of Evangelion"", which ranks up with Akira as the most influential anime movies of all time.

Partially because EoE is literally a gigantic middle finger to the otaku that rallied behind the series. ""I'm so fucked up"" isn't just Shinji talking about himself **jerking to completion over a comatose teen age Asuka** but also in the first-person perspective ""I [the viewer] am so fucked up [for jerking to completion over an underage girl's visage] "". Literally, *fuck you* for ""best girl""ing, for the sublimating women with complex and haunting emotional trauma to ""i can fuck the [kuudere]/[tsundere]/[old hag]"", *fuck you* for your infantile response to the possibility of a character being gay.  Scenes interspliced with death threats and shots of the outside of their office building vandalized, reminding otaku that *you did this*. EoE wasn't wholly a ""complete vision for the ending of Evangelion"" it's a spite-filled ""love"" letter to the otaku community.

Just like showing an adult their death threat tweets in person and they break down sobbing and ""I didn't mean to hurt that person with my threats"", End of Evangelion is a direct print out of the otaku communities crimes and forcing them to at least partially come to terms with their sins.

> ----------------------

I'd also like to point out End of Evangelion isn't even the initial attempt to ""correct"" the final two episodes; that's done by [Evangelion: Death and Rebirth](http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Death_and_Rebirth) (Evangelion Wiki link: also read the whole thing, the production is a **MESS** ), the first, [Death] , sublimating the series first 24 episodes into one-half of the movie, and the second half, [Rebirth], is the unfinished first 1/3rd of End of Evangelion.

How tight on budget was Evangelion's initial TV release?

*The studio wasn't sure about the project* (**and so wasn't going to fully fund it**) *until they saw the opening scene.*&&Very possible.  When researching the claims, I just assumed whoever created the matrixresolutions site in 2008 had a bad recollection of that time they listened to this commentary track in 2000 and posted the info without going back to verify what they were saying was accurate.

Everyone associates slow motion 360 and black fashion attire with the matrix.&&I still love the universe. The Animatrix and the two video games really fleshed things out. &&The problem was that the first movie was too self-contained.  Neo developed God-like abilities by the end of it, and there was no real reason to go further with the story.  So they just came up with a convoluted mess to fill out a couple of sequels.&&The second and third were good movies too. Everyone is hyper-critical of them, but they were good.

However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film.'

&&Yes, I whole-heartedly agree! It's just terrible to see them being bashed as if they weren't worth watching at all. Lot of symbolism throughout too.&&God no, those sequels were terrible attempts to create an ongoing storyline out a scenario that the first movie wrapped up nicely.

I wrote into a reviewer that spoiled it in their synopsis asking for spoiler tags.  It was clearly the directors intention to have that secret unfold in cinemas.  Nowadays it would be spoiled in the teaser that comes out a year early.&&It was horrifying. Can't imagine a movie ever getting close to true horror like this again. &&Same with Johnny Mnemonic here. Almost didn't see it because of that. Friends talked me into it.&&I mean Robert Rodreiguez did kinda that with Sin City. They didn't have the rights to it since Miller didn't want to release them to a studio since he thought they would make a shitty movie of it, but he shot the opening vignette for a few million and flew him to a private screening and got the OK and the movie was able to go into production.&&Unfortunately both Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed together. If the filmmakers had had the opportunity to study the feedback for Reloaded before making Revolutions then this could have been the greatest science fiction trilogy ever put on film.&&I thought it was pretty cool, especially when Neo indicates that the ""Prophecy of The One"" was just another level of control after speaking to the architect. Sort of a social commentary on religion.  

Also invites the Hindu philosophy of each generation having their own Messiah, in which there have been more than one ""The Ones"" and that the Prophecy was a system was designed to keep these ""messiahs"" under control of the system, by giving humankind the illusion of freedom from the matrix, which in itself was part of human philosophy and theology to make the whole thing seem all more real to them.   &&I believe IIRC the old discussions are still archived there, but that you cannot add new ones or comment on previous ones.

It went from ""What separates human consciousness from an artificial mind"" to ""ROBOOOOOOOOTS!  AGEEEEEEEEENTS!""

The Matrix was so God damn ahead of its' time and it had the potential to be the most amazing sci fi work of all time.

Visually, it's gorgeous, but storywise it lost everything that made the first Matrix so great.  

---

The sequels had their moments.  The causality scene was really interesting and delved into the ""untamed nature"" of humans.  Then with the architect, he explained how everytime he rewrote the Matrix, the same thing happened.  History repeated itself.

&&I rewatched it recently, and the sequels just really do not hold up. They had the potential to make a great trilogy that really went in to what makes humanity, what drives humans, AI vs human consciousness... and instead they went pure action movie, cheesy quips, ""love conquers all"", etc. 

Like, bringing Agent Smith into the real world? Tons of potential in that move. Does he start to discover his humanity? Grow feelings? No. He still just wants to kill people.

And the final battle in zion is just ridiculous. They have thousands of machines vs like 50 gunners, and instead of just flying *at* the gunners, they swarm around them letting them shoot them?

Or the last Neo vs Smith fight? They fly at each other, punch each other, and fly backwards? Like, I get it probably looked cool in their heads, but no.

The only good thing about the sequels is that the mythology they built actually opens up the possibility for a reboot that explores all the stuff they didnt before, that could even be called The Matrix: Rebooted, where the codebase is growing unstable again and generates another ""One"". 

I feel like I wouldve liked the sequels better if they went the predictable route of having Zion just be a second level of the matrix. Hell, make that the plot of Matrix: Rebooted, that the machines never gave humans the choice to stay in the matrix or leave after Neo sacrificed himself, because all they were really choosing was between one version of the matrix and another.&&The fanedit 'The Matrix: DeZionized' sort of does that, by re-editing both Reloaded and Revolutions as a single action-packed sequel that continues to focus on the action inside the matrix (Cuts out Zion almost entirely). Showed it to my girlfriend as her first sequel viewing after she ended up loving the first film - Because I had a strong feeling that she'd dislike the full Hollywood versions - And she said it was great and stood up to the original and didn't feel like she had missed anything.&&needs a supercut, kinda like folks have done with the Star Wars Prequal trilogy and the original trilogy with the machete order.

Edit: a word&&So, *cheese* sandwich then?&&This was mentioned in the last season of Fargo right before they talked about the fake moon landing.

Hmm.&&I smell a TIL incoming&&One of the foods suggested as the more favoured local lunch basically is a sandwich so it's far from unlikely that many people at various stages along the line considered the chosen meal an insignificant enough detail that it'd be easier to just say 'sandwich' so the story could continue and not get bogged down in the specific local food customs that don't really affect the story so I don't know if I'd consider the fact that Serbians probably didn't eat sandwiches to be a particularly convincing debunking. Even if the local foods didn't even resemble a sandwich in the slightest, I'd not consider that a major hurdle to accepting the broad detail of the story either since again, for English speaking audiences it could very likely have just been shorthand for 'light food' which also works regardless of the time of day as well.

However the lack of any mention in primary sources including from witnesses right there when it happened seems to pretty much put paid to the sandwich idea. &&Puppy monkey baby&&Orange monkey eagle?&&Let's all reminisce about IMDb.

&&They're not bad movies, they're still enjoyable.  Just into relation to each other they're lacking.

Like Metal Gear is amazing and Metal Gear V is a good stand alone game but in relation to Metal Gear it's bad.&&I agree. Personally, I felt the last two films had to evolve since the first film broke the ice (and the mold) of what the matrix is. The sequels had to give a driving force behind the second two films. Sure the love aspect might have been a tad heavy handed, but i think it was done overall pretty well. Especially when Trinitys death occurs. They didn't draw it out too far and made sure to get the point across.&&I felt like there was some shallow attempts at going beyond action, but it fell flat for me.&&Animatrix has two shorts dedicated to the war that serves as a prequel.

It's such a perfect playground for all of that thought because even the physicality of that environment (ie the action scenes!) lend themselves to those ideas. You can do that outside of the matrix too but *why* when you're filming *The Matrix*? I feel like Zion is just world-building side story that would be more suitable for something like The Animatrix.

>Johann Johannsson of Iceland (with whom Denis Villeneuve worked on Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, Editor's note) composes the main theme as planned. However, given the scale of the task, Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer joined the team to help Johann. It's hard to get to Vangelis' angle. We have Johann's breathtaking atmospheric sounds, but I needed other things, and Hans helped us.

Reddit will love this movie.&&Has there ever been an explanation for why they didn't bring back Vangelis to do the score? I've always found that a bit odd given how important his score is to the first movie and the fact that he was presumably available. Whoever composes the music for *Blade Runner 2049* is going to be in Vangelis' shadow regardless of how good their work is. &&As much as I love Zimmer, just let Johannsson work his magic with the Vangelis sound. Blade Runner is very simplistic and very mysterious. I feel like Zimmer's 'rushing symphony' would kind of ruin that.&&I like Zimmer, but I don't think his musical style is at all anything like Vangelis (much less Blade Runner).&&What movie doesn't have music by Hans Zimmer?&&There was a track towards the end of Dunkirk that I thought sounded massively like Vangelis' Bladerunner score. &&I'm a fan of cyberpunk and synth heavy music...

Went to see Dunkirk on release day and the trailer for this movie came out...

The sounds from the trailer were enough to make me want to watch this movie.&&I know people are gonna be disappointed with this, but Blade Runner is one of his favorite soundtracks. So I think since he admires it and works together with Johannsson it could turn out to be very good.&&*to feature music by Hans Zimmer's unacknowledged team of ghost writers at Remote Control. 


Seriously, I've lost so much respect for film scorers after learning about how much of the hard work is done by people who are unrecognized. 


The music they put out is great, but it's not done by one person. It's really frustrating. &&Why?&&Oh thank goodness. For a moment there I was afraid this movie was going to have a functional and memorable score. I miss Gladiator and Crimson Tide era Zimmer. &&Ugh, I do not like him at all, it's a shame that he's taking part in something I am otherwise looking forward to.

Already ready for downvotes based on not agreeing with me lol&&I have my concerns, but only that this is a signal of studio interference and makes me wonder what else is will be compromised with the film. I've only really know of JJ's work in Sicario, Theory of Everything, Prisoners and Arrival, where he generally excels in strong musical concepts with quieter, atmospheric and expressive themes. For HZ this means him and the team will likely help amplify the pre-existing themes (both Vangelis and Johannsson) for the action set pieces. The HZ brand will also attract and sell more copies. Hopefully this is the best of both worlds but I will remain cautious for now. &&I would've gone with someone like Ryuichi Sakamoto

Makes it kind of boring if it's the same guy all the time.&&Kinda disappointed by this news. Was hoping for something unique with this score and I've found Zimmer's scores to be just generic/bland in the past. Not saying he's bad, it's just that he's not experimental (like I feel this film needs) and he lacks the ability to manipulate emotions (like a John Williams - although Williams would also be decidedly unfit for this movie).&&Probably going back to dust off the synth he used for Black Rain&&Would have rather it been Vangelis to return to do the score.&&What, Vangelis was busy? :P&&Perfect &&I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. <BWAAAAMMM!>

It's boring. Let's give some other equally good (if not better) people a chance at scores, rather than give the same person for every film. Zimmer is a skilled person, but it leaves many big films having the ""same"" music. Need some variety.&&Hans Zimmer is everywhere, and I really don't like his music. He seems to always go for this over-the-top ""epic"" theme with everything. Definitely talented guy, but I feel like he's just in a lot of stuff because he's a big name, not because his music fits the theme of a movie. &&Dammit, I was really hoping that finally Johannsson might get some recognition this year through this and now he has to share it with Zimmer and Wallfisch. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Zimmer. I've been listening to Dunkirk everyday for the last few day and Wallfisch's theme from A Cure for Wellness might be one of the most memorable/hummable theme this year but I just want johannsson to get a moment of his own. Last year even though he had Arrival, most people remember Richter's  'On the nature of daylight' even more. &&No. I love Hans Zimmer; in fact he's one of my favorite artists of all time. But he is honestly not equipped to score this film. This is not a sci if epic with a huge string orchestrated score. This is the sequel to a genre-defining noir, retro-futuristic dystopian piece that uses the absurdity, terror and beauty of an incredibly disjoint soundtrack to create a truly ambient world. I have honestly yet to see someone recreate the complex emotions that Vangelis delivered that cast the film from 'great' to 'timeless'. 

I understand Zimmer's a huge name in Hollywood that most can relate to, but honestly anyone who's a fan of the Vangelis and specifically the Blade Runner score should be more worried about this than pleased.&&Meh. Hopefully Zimmer will stray away from his typical style&&Aw I wanted to be able to hear the dialogue /s&&How the fuck does this man have time for all these movies?! &&Why don't they just let Vangelis do it again? The man's still alive and well&&Why not get Vangelis? Blade Runner had one of the most amazing soundtracks imo and I feel like Hans is going to largely ignore it's tone and do what Hans normally does with his style.&&lame&&Ugh... Zimmer is terrible compared to Vangelis. The original Blade Runner score is an all time classic. Zimmer's loud horns and shit are just annoying.&&Zimmer is like the Sam L Jackson of movie music, so tired of him&&Part of what makes Blade Runner's score so great is the combination of fantastic atmosphere with beautiful, memorable melodies. Zimmer is not a strong melody writer so he really doesn't seem like the pick here&&What I don't get it...why didn't they just get Vangelis again? Did he not want to do it? Did they even ask him? &&WTF??? Didn't John McClane throw him off the Nakatomi Tower?&&Didn't he die at the end of the first Die Hard?&&I wonder which composer Hans Zimmer will borrow music from? &&Guess it won't be eligable for oscar nomination then just like The Revenant soundtrack&&So did Boss Baby.&&I just hope it's better than the Dunkirk music.&&Will he reuse the same song from The Rock and Pirates again?&&It sounds like a behind the scenes drama that probably will end up having been a pretty traumatic experience for Johanson. &&Why not Mitch Murder? His last track [Revision Control](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-revision-control) would have fit great!&&Is Vangelis aware of this?&&Woo more ticking&&I remember when Chris Nolan was in early production on Batman Begins, he talked about how he wanted to make ""Blade Runner with Batman"". That idea was heavily reflected in Hans' soundtrack to great effect. This feels so fitting in a way. I can't wait to hear this.&&Is anyone else worried that Zimmer might ruin this? It's not really his style and perhaps he is a bit commercialized now, sortof like John Williams

Every Williams score sounds the same.... I wouldnt want this film to sound like Inception and/or Batman&&[deleted]&&Is vangelis dead? If not, no excuse.&&What variant of the Gladiator/Pirates of the Caribbean song will we get this time? :-p&&BWAAAAAAAAAAH&&Disgusting.&&I have never been even remotely impressed by Zimmer's work. I just don't get it.&&I can sit and listen to the original Vangelis ost all day, not so sure about Zimmer, a lot of his music can be exhausting to listen to by itself. &&Why?

Is it a requirement to have Hans Zimmer involved in a film's music now?  What did he do for The Emoji Movie?&&I'm so hard&&Interstellar soundtrack is one of my favorites, packs a lot of emotions.&&My dick is the sun&&This is interesting because in Dunkirk, the scene where all the boats show up, had some music that reminded me of Vangelis' style. Benjamin Wallfisch might have been just as responsible for that as Zimmer.&&My first thought, well of course it will. &&*SPIDERMAN, SPIDERMAN*&&The Amazing Spider-man 2 had it too and I'm not too crazy about that movie.

His interview with Pharrel is a must see tho.&&it needs to be Com Truise&&I watch some of the trailers and I keep getting the idea this movie will be about Ryan Gosling walking around trying to look like a handsome runway model, looking at people with his mysterious snirky smile.&&That won't save it from being an abortion of a sequel that nobody asked for.&&Watching Dunkirk, it had a very noticeable 'Hans Zimmer' sound to it. Very Inception/Interstellar feel. Sort of distracted me to be quite honest. Not something bad or good, just something I noticed as a fan of Nolan and Zimmer. 

That being said, I hope Blade Runner 2049 doesn't fall into that category for me because in my opinion, the sound track in the original Blade Runner is what made it special. Dreamy futuristic sounds and all that stuff. Hopefully that 'Hans Zimmer' sound I've noticed is due to Nolan being the director of said movies. 

Either way, excited that Hans has a role in the new Blade Runner, lots of amazing talented people working on it should make it great. &&sooooo boring. why do does every film these days have to involve Hans Zimmer. get a new talent for a change. &&AHHHHHH&&WAAAAAAM!&&Dumb. Sounds like the director is basically admitting the score is no where near the level of Vangelis so they're bringing Hans on board in an attempt to fix it (and writing him a fat check I'm sure).&&well of course.&&I love Jan Hammer.&&BWAAAAA&&BWWAAAAAAAUUUUMMM!!!!&&Ryan gosling terrible fucking casting choice&&Was rather hoping for more of an outrun style sort of soundtrack of which there are countless ridiculously good artists out there but lets continue on with the Zimmer circlejerk for these big movies instead of taking a chance I guess.&&Wow. I can't wait to hear that same score he does with lots of bass and percussion and no melody.&&Fuck Hans Zimmer. We want Vangelis not fucking sleeping on his keyboard loud inception trailer music..ugh&&Can't wait to rate this as a 10 on IMDb without seeing it first. &&Wow. How underwhelming. &&I was hoping they would use Vangelis music 😭&&What a huge disappointment this is. Zimmerman can make wonderful things, but most of the time he's so uninspired and insipid. With the pedigree of the Vangelis score, this is a huge hit against the film.&&Hans Zimmer has direct control over my emotions. This is great news.&&I really hope this movie does well because it is the movie up my alley.&&Oops. Someone is hosting on hostgator.

About the worst choice in the entire cosmos. Almost as bad as superb internet.&&him and frank clepacki are my two favorite composers!&&Of course it will.&&#BWWWOOOONNNGGGG!&&Sold. Immediately. &&I used to say Hans Zimmer is the Michael Jordan of movie scores.  But as time goes by I realize that Michael Jordan is the Hans Zimmer of basketball. &&HOLY SHIT CYBERPUNK HANS ZIMMER????&&Denis Villeneuve, Harrison Ford, Hans Zimmer. Can't get much better than that.&&Jesus fucking Christ. 
So we got one of, if not the best director of the decade, one of the greatest cinematographers ever, an amazing cast(I still love Jared Leto), and now 2 of the best composers working today?!?! &&Boo. Only people I want scoring this film are Daft Punk. &&i feel like they should be using actual cyberpunk artist for this movie but that said, hans zimmer doesnt make me feel bad about it at all&&So many movies growing up with music I had no idea were composed by him. &&Hans Zimmer does Synthwave? &&Was kinda hoping Cliff Martinez would be attached in some way but I'm sure Hans Zimmer will do an awesome job&&Anyone go to their comic con tent? I thought it was awesome&&I guess the score will be far more intense and brutal than the first one then.

The movie kind of seems to be aiming in that direction too.&&It'd be cooler if Gene Winfield came back to do the cars. The guy's 90 but still working on stuff.&&*One more kiss, dear...*&&I'm not going to lie, I'm sort of bummed they didn't get Vangelis to do it again. 

Blade Runner is one of the few movies that I consider a perfect movie. The filmography, the set and mood/tone of the movie and the music all come together to make it what it is. Vangelis was as important to that  as Phillip K Dick, Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford&&I need to see Blade Runner, before 2049 comes out. &&I'm excited, but was I the only person who did not like the score for Dunkirk?  Interstellar was amazing though. &&No way.&&Would prefer Jon Vangelis. &&I like a lot of Han Zimmer's work, but as he ages, he is more and more  resorting to variations on the theme of a man passing out on a church organ at 120db. I'm pretty sure I still have permanent hearing loss from interstellar.&&Neat.&&its still crazy to me that he did mrs. doubtfire&&Brrrmmmmm brrrmmm&&DA DUM.... DUM... DA DUM... DONG)(my fallout 4 start screen music impression) &&ehhhhhh iono bout that one m8&&I know it will be great, but I just want to point out how the soundtrack (Vangelis) to the original is also stellar and different and not often remembered when it comes to great soundtracks of the 80's (which, to be fair, was THE decade for great movie soundtracks).&&💦💦💦&&What movie doesn't&&In other news, the sky is blue  &&Oh. RTFA for me, I guess. Thanks.&&You need to be very very careful when having more than one composer on a film.&&Of course &&Nice to see him stepping out of junky XL's shadow&&He's a very talented guy but he's done so much now that most of his stuff just kind of sounds the same to me. His music in the Batman trilogy was great (*The Dark Knight* score he did with James Newton Howard and Henry Jackman just about blew me away, especially ""Why So Serious?"") but other than that, I don't really go out of my way to listen to him. On the bright side though, at least it's not Harry ""Everything I've Done Since *Man on Fire* is an Almost Exact Carbon Copy"" Gregson-Williams. And speaking of film music, regardless of the movie itself, I've heard some pretty good things about Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe's work on the *Ghost in the Shell* reboot, but even with all the online petitions going around with countless fans demanding it, we'll probably never get an official release of that score in the near future, if ever at all. Guess we'll just have to listen to the licensed soundtrack release instead until someone leaks it online as shittily converted MP3's since Paramount and Lakeshore seem like they could both care less.&&Is that good?&&Every movie is a blank piece of paper. I have no idea how to do your movie. &&I have mixed feelings. I was really excited for my boy Johann (CREED). &&Yessssssssssssss&&I just watched a terrible movie called Nightmare at Noon. Terrrrrrible. When it started it said ""Music by Hans Zimmer"". I looked him up and none of his pages will admit it lol.&&Awesome.

I trust that Villeneuve and Zimmer will be able to come up with something really special. I too don't like everything Zimmer does, but he for sure is a legend has made some really great pieces. Some of my favorites are the electronic focused tracks he's done for Black Hawk Down and Inception.

I would have loved to see someone like Cliff Martinez or even Tangerine Dream take swing at the score though.&&They couldve just hired vangelis...&&Zimmer and Wallfisch killed the Dunkirk Score together. Them with Johansson on Blade Runner should be a great group of composers working on top notch stuff.&&> It's hard to get to Vangelis' ankle

What?&&Wallfisch too? He nailed the soundtrack for A Cure For Wellness.

This is one killer trio!&&I love Johan johannson. &&I'm so excited about this.&&Johann Johannsson is an amazing composer. The Theory of Everything is one of the most beautiful scores I've ever heard.&&Johansson is great in his own right. Zimmer is definitely great beyond any doubt and literally the reason I'll see Nolan movies more than once in IMAX but sicario was really well done. So while this is cool to hear I'm really excited to see what Johansson does &&Uh oh. Does this mean that it will sounds like Gladiator AND Pirates of the Caribbean?&&If it was new property that had A24 before the trailer people would already be talking about best picture.&&Should’ve brought back Vangelis. &&i feel like i should be offended but you're right&&I'mmmmm gonna cummmmm!!!&&God do I hate the circle jerk around Hans Zimmer.  A lot of his stuff just sounds the same to me. Especially seeing that he recycled his gladiator theme for pirates. And don't get me started on that Spider-Man soundtrack with pharell. &&Where's Christopher Nolan?&&the last movie Vangelis scored was from 2007, and he hasn't composed for many movies in general.&&Maybe he didn't want to do it?&&The strange thing about Vangelis is he's always jammed / played his stuff from the centre of his nest of keyboards. Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiFKU4UigEw

Now back in his CS80 days that strategy made a certain sound which for the time of 1980 / 85 evoked a futuristic and fantastical romantic feeling, it's music I still love but now that same sound (analog synths, arpeggiators, etc) evokes something else. Not the future but the past. We can't have a similar soundtrack to the original, it would seem like a pastiche.

Of course, Vangelis himself moved on from that sound, and he's still as skilled as ever - but what he moved onto has a less organic sound. He now favours a digital setup which produces sampled strings and orchestras, all from stacked digital instruments. It has a certain sonic quality which is ... not  great IMO.  Here's his current setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zzkalHmY10

In my opinion that his older sound is now heard as retro, and his newer sound has an unfortunate ""digital orchestra"" personality.
&&[deleted]&&I am a Vangelis mega fan. I have to say that I'm a little relieved that he, the living master, wasn't tapped to do this soundtrack. I say that because what made the Blade Runner Soundtrack for me was the aural palette that Vangelis was using at the time. Sadly, he abandoned most of that sound at the end of the 80's when his music got super complicated and noisy and orchestral. His lush, spacious, synthesizer heavy sounds are mostly gone. All the spaces in his music are filled now. Though, ""Rosetta"" is a pretty nice album.

I think Johannsson in incredibly overrated and I don't give a single damn about Hans Zimmer, so the best I can hope for is that Vangelis' work on Blade Runner serves as some, any, kind of inspiration or example for the sounds in this movie.

What helps me deal with the fact that there will never be another Blade Runner soundtrack is all of his other incredible work that used the same or similar palette - especially the following albums:

* Opera Sauvage
* Spiral
* See You Later
* Soil Festivities
* Invisible Connections

Faves:

""[Movement 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmS54OIkKY)"" from ""Soil Festivities"" - a beautiful 19 minute journey. Great on a long drive.

""[Rêve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OeW8aOfZQE)"" from ""Opéra Sauvage"". 12 and a half minutes of gentle wonder and peace

""[L'Enfant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE)"" from ""Opéra Sauvage"". This song communicates, to me, the innocent and wholesome triumph of a new life. 

""[To the Unknown Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evlb1JsaHLQ)"" from ""Spiral"". If this song means anything to you, please share. I imagine that it explains the exploits of a soldier who dies, lost to the world, and finds peace in an afterlife.
&&Vangelis has always chosen projects based on interest, not need.  He was already financially independent by the time he went solo in 1970 after Aphrodite's Child disbanded.

Bladerunner was composed before he had seen any footage... he was given a general idea of the story and created atmosphere pieces inspired by the concept rather than incidental music to punch up the action.  So I'm not sure that he felt particularly attached to the story in a way that would compel him to work on a sequel.&&I think he would be really bad at it. Compared to this guy who villeneuve regularly uses. He is a master of electronic tone imo. While blade runners music probably was ground breaking and cool at the time, he hasn't done anything similar since (based on me looking at his imdb.com).&&Vilenueve said the scale was too massive for Johannsson alone to tackle and he could only do the atmospherics well so Vilenueve brought in Zimmer to fill in. I think this OST will have the best of both.&&Have you listened to some of Hans' recent stuff that's not from Nolan movies? He is very much capable of creating more classical pieces too. Check out Rush (from a couple of years ago), Hidden Figures or Planet earth II (both less than a year old, last one is definitely recommended) if you haven't.

Also he's stated that the score from the original Blade Runner is his all-time favorite movie soundtrack. So if you ask me, he's perfect for the job.&&i think when most people think of zimmer, they're thinking of zimmer+nolan. Zimmer has a long and very well-rounded career in film. He's been in basically everything. He can do any style, really.&&Hans Zimmer made the music to The Pledge. And Dunkirk. He isn't all about rushing symphony. &&I agree. Zimmers work is good, but he takes on SO MANY projects that his sound isn't as impactful when you hear it. Keep it out of Blade Runner, hire Kavinsky or Carpenter Brut or something.&&If it sounds like it does in the trailer I'm fucking in. &&same. personally i got tired of Zimmer in general. just feels samey 'quality movie symphonical experience'.... which Blade Runners doesnt actually need anyway so why bring that in?&&What do you mean? Zimmer isn't confined. His scores don't all sound alike.&&What the hell do you mean Blade Runner is simplistic? Vangelis' original score is lush and dense which capture the complex and detailed visuals whilst also covering the complex theme of what it means to be human. It is the opposite of minimalist.&&Hans has done a tremendous about with very very simplistic themes.  It's something he's actually drawn criticism for.&&Maybe Zimmer was the second choice after Vangelis said no&&I'm absolutely sure Zimmer is aware of the differences between their styles of music and will work to make sure the OST he makes for this will be as close as he can get to the original sounds &&Just listen to some of his more atmospheric, synth-driven ambient pieces from say, TDKR or Inception, or even going back to his early days in the late 80s/early 90s - Black Rain, Broken Arrow etc. A lot of that stuff doesn't make the album cut because they generally take a backseat to his rock anthem-like themes, but are present in the movie itself. He's an outspoken Vangelis fan and you can certainly tell at times if you just look a bit beyond the endless ostinatos and pounding action theme statements. I mean, hell, just look at [Dunkirk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcgV4RZ874Y&feature=youtu.be&t=4m3s).

Zimmer is imo overrated as a composer who derives a lot of his fame and accolades undeservedly from stuff his team of ghostwriters and orchestrators cook up and he tends to oversimplify his compositions to a point where it's just simple-minded bass-heavy ruckus, but there's no denying he's a very good pick for this stylistically, almost as much as Johannson was in the first place.&&A lot of his earlier stuff would qualify. Most of the current listening base of Zimmer is familiar with a lot of his popular stuff Post-2000, but a lot of his earlier work like The Power of One, Black Rain, Days of Thunder, Chill Factor and Drop Zone would fit within this wheelhouse&&Listen to his older work. Everyone seems to be basing their views of his work on recent movies like inception and interstellar. Which incorporated new 'intense' sounds he's been working with. Look at ""Now we are free"", and the MW2 OSTs. He's great at capturing feeling in different settings. It's not all inception's ""BWAAAAA"".&&Star Wars, thank God. &&The first Blade Runner. So he better not fuck this with a symphonic sound, because Blade Runner is not that. :P&&This? https://youtu.be/NcgV4RZ874Y?t=4m3s&&Blade Runner was always a huge inspiration for Hans. It's one score he wished he had done but given Vangelis' did such a tremendous job he is inspired. I thought Inception had some of that too.&&According to Spotify, the last two tracks of Dunkirk were not actually scored by Zimmer&&I thought the same thing. Didn't help that the theater showed the Blade Runner 2049 trailer before Dunkirk. Great track however. &&I think I know the one you're talking about. It used the progression from Nimrod by Elgar. &&You have seen Blade Runner then, I presume? &&Just a note if you don't know, the trailer music is not done by the composer of the movie. And is most of the time not representative of what will be heard in the movie. Obviously they use the theme in trailer, but that might be as far as it goes. But you might have known this already. 

Source: am trailer composer. &&[deleted]&&>Does Zimmer have to do every movie there is?

Honestly, after seeing Dunkirk, I have no problem with that. The man is a genius.&&Stop exaggerating. What movies has he done recently? He put a lot into Interstellar, Batman/Superman, and just did Dunkirk but damn, all his other other recent scores I gaurantee he only had a minor role in scoring. Hans Zimmer is just the name of the company now. Apart from that what is EVERY movie you refer to?&&No, I'd say Michael Giacchino is hired for every movie's score. Hans Zimmer is definitely a safe bet these days, but at least does something slightly different each time.&&Well, it's a three person effort. I hope we get the best of three worlds instead of some catastrophe.&&I can't remember a score making me feel as anxious as Mombasa in Inception.&&Severely underrated, that one&&I didn't know you were here too :-P&&[removed]&&Johansson is a subtle and ""ambient"" composer, he doesn't do the massive movie defining suites that completely steal the show. In my opinion it's the correct way to approach scoring movies, but sadly it's never going to be as flashy or recognized. People in general have a hard time appreciating ambient music.&&I noticed that. When most people say they loved Arrival's score, they don't mean Johannson's score. They're talking about Richter's song. &&Definitely agree, this is not the news I wanted to hear about the movie. I can't see Denis sitting there saying, lets bring in Hanz Zimmer. I think WB or Sony or Alcon dudes, whoever is in control of the final cut (we know it ain't Denis) made this decision. Now i'm worried, and man this movie looked quite promising...&&Many artists are capable of working in various styles. Even if 90% of the time they're being commissioned to produce their ""signature sound,"" that doesn't mean there isn't more range or depth on tap.&&Unless Zimmer builds on the established themes, which is possible&&Agree 100%.&&He's not here to take the reigns and 'Zimmer-fy' the score, he's been brought in to supplement Johann's already present input on the score. People are acting like he's writing the entire soundtrack, when really he's most likely jsut adding some structure and flourish to what Johannsen has already written.&&I think the film, with or without the score is timeless itself. The score is definitely amazing, and elevates the film, like all good scores do, but the film is all about visual atmosphere. I once had to watch it with no sound just with subtitles, due to some reason. Still excellent. Of course, the score makes it better.&&I'm with you.  The man is a parody of himself and has begun to replace scoring with sound design.  It may suit the imagery onscreen, but much of the result will be uninteresting outside the context of the film.  ""Dunkirk"" is a perfect example of his recent tendencies.  Imagine if someone took a symphonic stab at the Blade Runner aesthetic.  That would really be something, and very original, in this day and age. &&He outsources to people in his company ""Remote Control Productions"" and then tacks his name onto it. He abuses ghostwriters so that his name is on the biggest movies so people think he's the best.&&Only Samuel L Jackson is good at acting.&&That may be why I haven't ever got into his music, it's a lot of sound but I can't get any feeling from it. And the lack of strong melodies may be part of that reason. I'll reserve final judgement until I hear some of his work for the movie...but i'm a bit worried now.&&probably because they want it to sound more modern.&&hah, well as others have said Vangelis kind of laid the groundwork. Throw in a dash of Cliff Martinez and you're good to go.&&Same with Arrival as well...&&Like what? What's wrong with Zimmer?  
  
edit: it's just a question, guys...&&Yeah, my expectations for this movie dropped from ""mildly optimistic"" to ""fuck, they really don't get it and this is going to suck."" Not just because I don't like Zimmer, but because Zimmer means a two note (literally) thumping action movie score, when a huge part of what made the original work was the Vangelis' atmospheric work. Blade Runner is a slow burning philosophical work of science fiction. It is not a big dumb action movie.&&I was hoping someone would mention that soundtrack &&Hans can't bring it near the level of Vangelis either.&&Off-topic but on-point.&&Why don't producers hire Vangelis for big budget films these days?

He's done film score as late as 2012, just not anything the public knows about.&&but wait there's more: Roger fucking Deakins, son. &&Harrison Ford hasn't given a decent performance since What Lies Beneath.  Don't hold your breath&&I really wish they would have left Harrison Ford out. It's film noir - dude is gone.&&I can understand people liking Zimmer but to call him one of the best composers today is ignorant of the entire orchestral music scene. He is good at what he does but every classically trained composer (which he is not) can do it in their sleep. &&Please no. &&The score for dunkirk is not listenable, it is unsettling, unnerving, but I think it is done on purpose. Not his best though.&&Why didnt they just hire vangelis?&&Hollywood really needs to take some risks in the music realm. Junkie XL (Mad Max) and the guys from Survive (Stranger Things) really made some amazing pieces. I would even recommend Steve Moore of Zombi. He has crafted some great stuff. &&Yep I'd have loved to see Cliff Martinez as well.&&Tangerine Dream would have been amazing. &&I may be in the minority here, but I thought Zimmer's score for Interstellar was magnificient&&> Cliff Martinez or even Tangerine Dream

or DAFT PUNK&&I loved his MoS soundtrack.   Lots of darkish ambient styles.  But I also love Vangelis and hope to hear their version. &&Tangerine Dream is amazing.  **Radio Massacre International** is an updated take on their stuff and is worth a listen.  Don't forget [Klaus Schulze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRmSrg5GK8Q).

For a more ""millenial"" feel, stuff like [2814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9L4q-0Pi4E) or [HKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkLPgAO36Kk) would have been right at home as well.&&Tangerine Dream with Hans would be a pretty incredible formula. 

Edit: also M83 and Joseph Trapanese. (Oblivion, Tron, Ender's Game)&&When  they bring on a known quantity like Hans fucking Zimmer to ""help out"", it's PR speak for ""our composer didn't deliver, but we don't want a single negative headline for the internet to run with"" &&I guess he likes to wear boots or something.&&*angle

Google Translator tends to screw up.&&A24 is love, A24 is life &&Wouldn't be surprised if it did get best picture, some of the scenes shown in the trailers was gorgeous.&&Whats A24?&&Of course, because when something becomes a trustworthy sign of quality the counterjerk has to begin post haste...&&Agreed, though he's getting up there in age and he doesn't seem to really need the money... his projects tend to be driven by interest rather than need.&&The Vangelis soundtrack is what made the original. Gonna be hard to capture the same atmosphere without it. &&Vangelis was hot shit back then, and it's only logical to use an original composer again. Unless Vangelis has seriously reinvented his music it will only sound old. &&Nah. Shouldn't have made a sequel at all. The first really didn't need it. That said if they're going to try they might as well go with as many fresh elements as possible. There will be enough retreading of old ground in the film as it is. &&[deleted]&&Shut up, Dick-The-Birthday-Boy.&&https://youtu.be/QJ70b-WRHlU?t=1m30s&&The majority of people don't listen to much instrumental music so Hans Zimmer is most of Reddit's first exposure to it, especially considering the popularity of the films they're found in.

I'm sure if people cared enough to dig further and listen to more they'd come to the same conclusion, but most people don't and that's fine.&&It's recycled and homogenous because he ghostwrites fucking everything.  He has a company he outsources the work to, and then he slaps his name on it at the end.&&Yes he recycles and basically remixes his stuff constantly, but his stuff still sounds amazing.&&He's said he doesn't do sequels. &&I love this video and I wish there were more like it. [This is another one I love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTD56R6FNnE).

Have you heard of [the Tegos tapes](http://vangeliscollector.com/movies_microneurosurgery.htm)? They're a VHS collection of 10+ hours of videos of surgeries performed by Dr. Tegos. The surgeon is a personal friend of Vangelis and asked him to provide music for these procedures.

Some edits are available online. I'll bet these were all done in one take, too.

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW3_jpG6ShE) is over 8 hours with no voiceover.


&&> but what he moved onto has a less organic sound.

Isn't that sort of poignant in respect to the movie. Maybe an inorganic retro feel is exactly what the film needs.&&But cyberpunk these days *is* a pastiche of 80s stylings and predictions of the future. Without that and with only a bare cyberpunk type premise you're making a garden variety modern day techno thriller. Hell, look at Jeremy Scahill's documentary Dirty Wars. There's leaks and hacking, governmental cover-ups, truth seeking journalists being persecuted, private contractors and secretive governmental agencies colluding and getting up to all sorts of shady shit, all topped by flying fucking death robots. Throw in some neon, blocky cars and a synth, and you have yourself a decent cyberpunk flick.&&Still sounds great&&Vangelis' Titans track from ""Alexander"" (2005) is a masterpiece, sadly only used for credits of the movie: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OankX_bMnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OankX_bMnus)

That movie could have been the next Gladiator, what happened?&&It was experimental compared to many Hollywood scores, but not experimental in general... Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre (son of Maurice Jarre), Giorgio Moroder and others were doing this stuff in the early 1970's (Edgard Varese, Pierre Henry, Walter/Wendy Carlos and others paved the way in the decades before).

In the 70's, Vangelis in particular was doing material way more experimental and abstract (e.g. Dragon, Hypothesis, Beauborg, Albedo 0.39, etc.)... Bladerunner was, relatively, more conventional electronic composition, as was Moroder's work on Cat People the same year.... neither necessarily riffing off the other, but just an example of how that sound was in demand after Chariots of Fire the previous year (which itself was an iteration of themes Vangelis did on Heaven and Hell in 1973).&&Zimmer and crew have been incestuously self-referential for a while now, I'm pretty bummed that's the way they're going for this film.  At least if Williams always sounds like Williams, it's reliably good stuff. Can't say the same for the Zimmer factory. &&And for the [25th anniversary edition of the soundtrack](https://www.amazon.com/Vangelis-Blade-Runner-Trilogy/dp/B001NTFQRY/), he composed an entire album's worth of new Blade Runner music, so he probably feels like he's done with it. Most of the fans didn't much care about the bonus album, because there's no nostalgia for them, but personally, I loved it and felt like I was getting to experience even more of that world.

The adventure game was even better in that regard.&&great comment. shamelessly plugging my Vangelis Spotify playlist for those who enjoyed Blade Runner soundtrack but haven't had a chance to get to know maestro's music better. note: do not shuffle and use 10 seconds Crossfade setting for a better ""cinematic"" feel:

https://open.spotify.com/user/djfutures/playlist/6XbnVaBqT9dzm3vPB4Xsbn&&Thanks for this post, I absolutely love the Blade Runner soundtrack and have been wanting to really get into Vangelis but have found it difficult to know where to even begin with his catalogue! Do you have an album in particular you'd recommend?&&It's not the first time he used parts of other great composers, too. One of the most memorable themes of ""Arrival"" was done by Max Richter. (It was already used in ""Shutter Island"" but I think people will more likely think of ""Arrival"" when they hear it.)

> In addition to your score, Arrival utilizes Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight” for a few key scenes. Did you have a hand in selecting the music you did not compose? Is that part of your collaborative process with Denis?
Yeah. The intro and outro scenes are very different in tone than the rest of the film. Denis wanted an approach that would be in strong contrast to the main bulk of the movie. The opening scene was edited to Max’s track very early on and it worked beautifully as temp music. Frankly, I didn’t really want to do a knock-off of the music, you know? [Laughs] So it was really… I did my own version for the intro and outro that was very different, a very different approach. It was down to Denis’ choice to either use my approach, which was closer to the approach of the score itself, it was a vocal track, or to use Max’s track. I very much supported his decision to use Max’s track because it works beautifully and it supplies a very strong contrast to the rest of the score. I think, artistically, it was a very good decision to keep that track there. He had my full support to include that music.

Q: http://www.slashfilm.com/johann-johannsson-arrival-music/
&&fair enough&&[deleted]&&God I cannot wait to buy the soundtrack.  It's gonna sound so badass.&&Agreed. Dream team. This happened on Arrival too. (Not zimmer, but they used an outside piece not by Johansson for a key theme). 

I think this disqualifies the score from the Oscars though. Something about multiple composers?&&Hans also composed The Lion King for christ's sake. Dude has range. &&Or listen to some of his earlier non-Nolan movies.

I'd pay double for the movie ticket.&&His sound? Why do people think all his scores sound alike? People heard the interstellar and inception themes, and that's what everyone seems to be basing their views about his work on. His recent work has involved a few scores with  those sounds because it was new. So he played around with it. Listen to his older work. It doesn't all sound like inception. My first memory of Zimmer was Gladiator. He even did the OSTs for MW2. &&That's exactly why they go to him. Do the other guys churn out reliable Hollywood scores in their sleep? They would never take the risk. Better in their minds to let one composer lay some groundwork and have an industrial-level composer come in and get the massive amount of scoring work done. The process of putting scores together is really different from what most people probably imagine.&&Agree on the ghostwriters, disagree on the simpleminded ruckus. The complexity of the music has exactly nothing to do with how good it is, Time is one of the simplest soundtracks out there yet it's also one of the most brilliant and moving.&&I have to completely disagree that he's an overrated composer. I've enjoyed his work since first hearing it in 'Gladiator' as a kid. People are saying stuff like this now, because of the ""big sound"" scores in movies like interstellar and inception. He's an exceptional composer capable of capturing feeling in different settings. &&what the heck.. this is an Elgar piece! wasn't expecting that. They play this at funerals all the time. Fitting, I guess.&&Yeah 5:10-5:50 has some definite Vangelis vibes to it&&Thats mainly a reworking of Elgar's nimrod, which in the UK is heavily associated with WW2, especially the early parts of the war and the RAF. &&That sounds a little Vangelisy but it wasnt that. I remember it was against waves, and had that instrument similar to Rachels Theme kind of pulsing over this electronicy score. &&Benjamin Wallfisch and Lorne Balfe helped with the score but they didn't write any tracks by themselves IIRC&&I think he vaguely means the movie and not the chronological track order of the OST.&&I always thought they reused samples a lot in trailers. Do you get to score trailers how you like or given a lot of direction?&&I'm getting tired of the same fucking ""BWWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" sound in every god damn trailer.&&fuck that score for raising my blood pressure &&I love Inception, but I honestly can't remember any of the score aside from the ""bwaaaaaam"" Inception moment. &&Yes I'm on this Reddit &&Case in point.&&Parody of himself? Wtf. Dunkirk is a great unnerving score outside the film, as if he hasn't done the symphonic approach to death also, kinda happens when you score for over 30 years. Does he have a score like Dunkirk that I haven't heard? Interstellar is his best score and that came recently, it fit that movie perfect and so does the Dunkirk score. Who cares if it's 'sound design'? It's not supposed to be a stand-alone. If it is, that's a bonus.&&> sound design

Fitting sound design is kind of what Vangelis' score was. Unfortunately Zimmer tends to be bombastic rather than atmospheric.&&Yep I think you just nailed it, his music fits the movie but outside of that it isn't something you would want to listen to alone. Listening to his music out of context doesn't really take my mind anywhere...there is no magic to it. Hopefully he's just doing 2-3 tracks that are kind of atmospheric and that's all, just to flesh out the longer runtime of the movie.&&Honestly, I'm surprised he doesn't get called out on this more often around here.  Every single thread about Hans Zimmer is filled with people sucking his dick and calling him a genius, when all his stuff is ghostwritten. &&Damn. Is this common for composers?&&It's not just a lack of strong melodies for Zimmer (except for Pirates of the Caribbean, if those are actually his melodies), but a lack of any development or progression in his music. Some music can give a lot of feeling without melody, but it still needs to tell a story. Zimmer's music tells no story and goes nowhere. It's all missing something that proper music should have. Just about everything he writes sounds incomplete.&&To me Zimmers work always feels like the run of the mill standard movie score. I've never had a desire to go and listen to a Zimmer soundtrack after seeing a movie. They should have hired Cliff Martinez, someone who could do more experimental and creative sounds.

Honestly this is a red flag to me, sounds like they are frantic trying to get the movie polished in time and couldn't nail down the sound. Hoping everything turns out okay and no reason to start mashing the panic button.&&HONESTLY. This entire comment section has completely neglected the fact that Zimmer can make  nice atmospheric music. Mixed with Johansson, I believe that this music will be great. Not every Zimmer piece is the Pirates theme re-used. &&He won't. Vangelis played a huge role in the popularity of the original Blade Runner. No one had heard anything like it in a movie. The sound he came up with was just so amazing and perfect. He's part of what made that film into a masterpiece. Bad, bad move not taking the couple million or so out of their $200 million budget to get Vangelis on board this time. They fucked up. I honestly either think this film or new Star Wars is going to be a dud. I just hope this ""trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice"" Hollywood phase would hurry up and run its course.&&> What Lies Beneath. Don't hold your breath

Appropriate.&&*Film composers &&I've been asking the same question. He's 74 so maybe he's retired now?&&From what I hear there was some arguments going around between Vangelis and some peeps. Though don't quote me on that. &&Junkie XL was given the Mad Max gig by his mentor... Hans Zimmer. It really is a tight knit community there.

&&Former engineer for Zimmer here. The reason that studios are wary of taking chances on musicians is that scoring is a very different discipline, and there's so many examples of talented musicians being out of their depth when it comes to the process of score.  It's an immense task to score an entire film, just think about The Dark Knight where virtually the entire film has music in it. Most artists have trouble putting a hour long album together. Now to do it to image, while intellectualizing the meaning or atmospheric intention of the film, while managing studio execs, directors, producers and music directors, and then controlling all the poeple involved with production such as the music editors, sub composers, additional contributors, engineers, orchestrators, assistants, a full size  orchestra and conductor (if not the composer), the union staff, and all the poeple needed to make that all work. To a deadline usually of a few short months. And there's the other problem: delivery. You literally cannot miss the deadline and the score is the very last thing that gets done before it goes to the dub which is usually only days, even hours in some cases before the release. That's why cool bands or producers don't get to score often, because frankly, it takes a level of organizational talent and discipline that even the best musicians in the world don't have a grain of. If yoy ever hear Hans speak about what he does, he'll tell you he delivers, and it's the truth. I don't beleive, in the entire span of his multi decade career, he's ever missed a deadline. Not one, yet hollywood is littered with films that went awry because one element wasn't delivered on time, and many including the score. When you're dealing with budgets in the millions just fir the score, studios don't take chances, because it's not just about having a crap score, it's whether the movie gets released on time, and that can cost the entire budget.&&Johannsson is a great composer though - it'll be a great score for sure&&For real. M83 and his score for Oblivion is another great example. The music really just made the whole movie.&&In regards to some straight up uncomfortable ambient elevator music, the score that Reznor (and his partner I can't place atm) made for Gone Girl is right up at the top of Hollywood taking chances. I do agree, the bigger films need some versatility, but I love what Junkie XL & Hans did for Wonder Woman. I never would've guessed that of all characters WW would have the single best theme in BvS. I loved that the composer carried it over for the WW stand-alone as well. It showed up A LOT in WW, but it was intertwined into other pieces. I loved it. 

I would like for Hans & XL to switch up their seemingly go to formula tho, because they are better than just extremely loud, extremely percussive. 

I must say that John Williams, in his late 80s, is still dropping jewels. I thought his score for Sith was BY FAR the best in all of the SW saga. And then, TFA's score hit online, and I was floored. I don't think it was edited into the actual film as well as it could've been, but thematically, it picks up RIGHT where he leaves off in Sith. I can't wait for the score to TLJ to drop. Considering his next few films could very well be his last, I expect him to deliver masterpieces. He kind of had a stale period in the years after the SW prequels and TFA. For example, I thought Lincoln had some pretty forgettable music. 

Also shouts out to the guy who scored Nocturnal Animals. He captured the EXACT essence of Hermann, & should be upheld for his triumphs. 

There's some VERY good music out there, but a lot of times, it isn't in the giant blockbusters. There are some interesting new composers on the rise and I am looking forward to how things switch thematically. It does kind of feel like we get the same piano renditions of heavy or iconic scores in trailers and then most blockbusters are just 1000 different types of THUMPING drums!! &&I really want to see Disasterpeace working on more movie projects.

He's mostly done games, but I like his It Follows score.&&Mica Levi has done some really good stuff in my (uninformed) opinion.

Totally not the same thing.&&Hey another Cliff Martinez fan! Don't see that too often&&Edgar Froese died 2 years ago.&&[deleted]&&I think Interstellar was probably the movie score that made me genuinely want to start working on scores myself. His music made that movie what it is. &&I would give you the Tron Legacy soundtrack to dispute that. Disney brought on Zimmer to help Daft Punk as they are not soundtrack composers but his help was minimal and that soundtrack is one of the best in the last 10 years.&&Doubt it.  Have you heard the score to Arrival or Sicario?  They're amazing.&&Haha, thank you!

Arrival (in my opinion) deserved best picture, but it got fucked at the Oscars due to being sci fi.&&I guess he wants to do original stuff and not sequels.&&That’s true.  Also the whole theory about Deckard being a synth was something that wasn’t in the theatrical cut, so I’m sure that’s gonna be a huge part of the sequel just because. &&I know what that is!!!!&&why are you being so pretentious? it's not about instrumentality of the music that's great about zimmer. &&Everyone should just realise most of their knowledge of things is shallow and chances are their favourite things are actually shit, and just not make it part of their personalities.&&Whoa. Sources, please? &&That description makes it sound a lot more heinous than it is. Essentially, his name is a product and there's too much demand. Instead of limiting himself to only working on what he could do by himself, he mentors and trains other composers to work in his style and leaves the ""grunt work"" of composing a film score to them. It's likely that he'll lay out the main themes and concepts himself, then work closely with his collaborators as they develop his ideas before he puts on the finishing touches and gives final approval. This is not a new thing: famous renaissance artists like Raphael or Leonardo had apprentices and students who contributed to their works, and many composers have done the same.

This isn't to say that all of Zimmer's work is done by a group of associates - you can tell the difference between the projects he invests artistically in (e.g. Interstellar) and the projects he leaves to his collaborators (e.g. Inferno, which had no less than **five** other composers credited).&&What about squeakquels?&&[The videos themselves are all on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user14173895)&&There's a theory about scoring film that it should tell you something you aren't seeing on the screen. Think of Clint Eastwood as the man with no name in Leone's westerns, Morricone's themes add a texture which otherwise wouldn't be there. The ocarina noise for Clint, the music box sounds for Van Cleef.  They add a DIFFERENT layer to the characterisation.

In Blade Runner (original) Vangelis's romantic and bombastic musical personality brought a new layer of character to the city. Without his layer of character the film would be very different, imagine it with something less emotional.  A Kraftwerk soundtrack might seem a great idea but the visuals already tell us that layer. What we need is a way to nonverbally convey the themes that the script and cinematography cannot in the allotted time.

The visuals and script can deliver the inhumanity of life at the bottom of the cyber barrel, the music needs to deliver the juxtapositions to that.  That's part of why BladeRunner1's score worked so well. It was profoundly emotionally human.

The CS80 was a unique instrument for articulation, poly-aftertouch and performance ribbon. His midi setup cant compete on articulation.&&And the theme the director originally wanted for Chariots of Fire was ""L'Enfant"" from ""Opéra Sauvage"". [Vangelis him to let him make something new for him based on that song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ra_sauvage#Other_appearances).

[They are similar!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwLtjnNIS9M)&&[deleted]&&As someone getting into the genre, I'm saving this comment. Cheers.&&His score for Dunkirk was pretty great. Very tense and suspenseful. Nothing like the bombast that has come to be associated with him and Nolan.&&[deleted]&&Thanks. And shit - I wish I had Spotify. 

I'll get it one day and this playlist will be the first one I play.&&Thanks, a lot of his best work is in this, followed. &&Kinda sad there isn't any from his band aphrodite's child in there, his music plus Demis Roussos vocals are amazing. &&You're very welcome!

Those songs that I linked to are right up your alley, except, probably for ""To the Unknown Man"". They will make you happy as a fan of the soundtrack. As an album, I think ""Opéra Sauvage"" has some great stuff - but it's not exactly like Blade Runner. It's a great place to start, though!

I was really satisfied with the sound textures in ""Movement 1"" from ""Soil Festivities"". They are a lot like stuff from the soundtrack.

Note that ""Memories of Green"" from the soundtrack was actually taken from the ""See You Later"" album, which has many songs with vocals in them. 

Another note - ""Tales of the Future"" from the soundtrack features the voice of Demis Roussos, who was his former bandmate in ""Aphrodite's Child"". He recently passed away :(

&&> The opening scene was edited to Max’s track very early on

the scourge of temp scores strikes again&&That was a great read. Thumbs up!&&> Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight”

Such a sweet but sad song.  It was well placed in Arrival.  Hard not to get misty eyed when I hear it.  Apparently it was also used as the lead song for the soundtrack of a movie called Disconnect (2012).  Or so Spotify just told me when I searched for that song.  IMDB/RT/Ebert suggest that the movie might be good as well, so this comment thread is leading to all kinds of good new info.  &&Max Richter is one of my favorite artists working today, he's amazing. I put on his album Sleep in the background all the time, it's so beautiful and relaxing. And some of his older albums like The Blue Notebooks are just awesome. &&:(&&[deleted]&&Anarchy Road is so damn good!&&[deleted]&&Zimmer being overrated isn't negated by people liking him, though.&&People tend to think him as 'over-rated' for the sound he manufactures nowadays, as it's classified as typical blockbuster type scores... These people tend to forget that he was the prototype for that exact sound that they've come to know so well, he created a genre almost in and of itself.&&> People are saying stuff like this now, because of the ""big sound"" scores in movies like interstellar and inception.

Music critics have been saying this since the 90s of Zimmer. Fact is, his music is generally exceedingly simplistic, minor key pounding and droning with terrible mixing crushing whatever orchestra he uses to sound like substandard sampling and outside of a handful of main theme statements, the vast majority of his music is completely interchangeable.

Zimmer makes some great stuff from time to time, don't get me wrong. No one can argue Gladiator, Da Vinci Code, Frost/Nixon or The Rock aren't great scores. He also breaks his own mold every now and then, with terrific results. But the vast majority of his blockbuster scores are generic, inelegant simplistic tripe with only a handful of decent ideas behind it.

Those substandard Zimmer works still function in the context of the films they accompany, but they don't elevate them in any way and only serve to compound the sameness of modern day blockbuster cinema.&&You'll get choked up when Nimrod plays in the movie. I did.&&Wallfisch did the Elgar variation, IIRC&&If you're doing customs/covers/augmentations, ie Star Wars or Logan, it's always pretty specific. Needs to be so long, have this, this, and this in it. With this type of feel. Maybe this or this instrument. This many different sections. Etc etc. And even then if you do all that they might use three separate tracks for the trailer. And they pretty much always cut the hell out of the tracks and layer extra sound effects over it for all the quick cuts. And 99% of the time we don't see the picture. We just get a detailed brief and usually a deadline that was yesterday. 

But the other half of trailer music is simply just licensed music. Composers pump out tracks of different genres for a bunch of publishing companies. Those companies them throw their music at trailer houses and editors (the guys who cut the trailers for the production company of the movie) and hope that they can get a track or two in something. More often than not you will find this type of music in the trailers that I previously mentioned that might use two or three different tracks throughout. So in a sense, you more or less get to write this music how you want to as long as it's the required genre, though there is such a thing as trailer-friendly music and not-trailer-friendly music. And if you want to get paid...well you better be doing the former. Which, in my personal opinion, can become terribly boring. 

As an example, I wrote an ""emotional, uplifting"" track in late 2014. Never got used for anything. Then in 2016 the first 40 ish seconds of it was used in the theatrical trailer for Pete's Dragon. After 40 seconds it was a different track that just happened to be on the same album of the company that I did mine for. 

Sorry. Long explanation. The trailer industry is actually much different than I think a lot of people perceive it though. &&Harvey Dent... can we trust him?&&You must be joking. &&You realize that not every soundtrack/score (or underscore, emphasis on the ""under"") is meant to be listened to apart from the film. Yeah, Hans Zimmer's soundtracks usually can be listened to outside of the film but take a movie like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or Sicario (which JJ made) and those soundtracks don't really stand alone. Yeah you can still listen to them but you won't get the same effect as you would watching it with the picture. Dunkirk was not made so you could listen to the soundtrack on your iPhone or watch it on your laptop. It's a movie made for IMAX 70mm and other large formats. That means, the soundtrack is made for that too. If you ask any film composer anywhere, from any time, they will tell you the music is made to compliment the movie. Not the other way around.&&You're kidding, right? Interstellar score takes you no where? That is the most magic score I've heard. In context or out of it. Listening to the Dunkirk score puts me right back in the movie also. It's cold, apocalyptic, unnerving... sure, not everyone can listen to that.&&Could not agree more.&&Yeah and I think bringing him into the game this late means he may not be able to get a handle on themes for characters and the ideas in the movie. Like some directors like to involve a composer in early stages to map out themes and sounds for certain characters/locations moods etc. I feel like Zimmer might kind of just show up, slaps some shit together and call it done. Standard hollywood score shit&&>  if those are actually his melodies

They aren't, the first movie was scored by Klaus Badelt. Who probably not coincidentally also worked on every Zimmer score that actually gets praised by name, aside from Inception and Interstellar.&&Only his more recent stuff. His whole catalogue is incredibly varied&&Some of his scores are fairly generic, but some are extremely memorable, and even iconic. Interstellar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Lion King, Kung Fu Panda, even Man Of Steel and BvS. &&>I've never had a desire to go and listen to a Zimmer soundtrack after seeing a movie. 

Really? Not even Interstellar or Inception or The Dark Knight? Their OSTs had me hooked even before I watched the movie. Damn I looove his Superman theme. It's all subjective I guess, Zimmer isn't the best but he really isn't as generic as a few make him out to be. He really knows tension and intensity. Fingers crossed for a Dunkirk nom next year. 

Film Twitter is very excited by this collaboration. So when I brought the news here I was expecting unequivocal applause. Guess you can't please everyone ;-)&&Still not true, there are scores of talented film composers who have more musical talent in their pinkies than Zimmer does in his whole body.&&>  vangelis

He's still going he released a new album last year too&&Giorgio Moroder is 77 and still does an occasional show.&&""Yo, SparrowHAWX been saying that Vangelis has been stirring some shit up, being real argumentative.  Yep, that's what he said.""&&Which is really unfortunate &&mentor i dont think is the right word. more like colleague or friend.&&As someone who produces bands and artists for a living, you hit the nail on the head.  A huge reason a lot of bands and producers fail or succeed is their ability to deliver.

The music industry is quite small.  Not because of some conspiracy or secret free mason group or something:  Talented people who can also deliver are just a scarce breed.  

Organization and artistry are rare bedfellows.&&I read that the composer for the Lord of the Rings, Howard Shore, at one point was writing up to 11 minutes of movie score a day. And I remember reading that that was an insane amount.&&Johannsson is amazing, the only film scores I've copped.&&Trent Reznor works with Atticus Ross&&I don't want to speak for Junkie XL but saying that Hans Zimmer should switch up because ""not everything has to be loud and extremely percussive"" is essentially picking a few of his movies to describe everything he does.

I feel like everybody just immediately pictures the Inception horn which was made cliche by Hollywood but was brand new at the time. Hardly ever do you hear mention of 12 Years a Slave or Interstellar or even the majority of the Dark Knight Trilogy. He is an extremely versatile composer who everybody thinks only does BWAAAAAAH whereas some of my favourite pieces of his are the slower ones.

Couldn't find a link but Goodbye My Son from Man of Steel

These are all just from some of his most famous soundtracks in the last few years. (Although holy crap I just realized Batman Begins is 12 years old). I think saying that he needs to mix up his go to formula from the loud percussive sound is just a bit of a strange remark seeing that he does so much more that goes unnoticed.

At the same time, his style is also about the epic scores. You wouldn't go to Kendrick Lamar for the next best rock record. Directors go to him because they want that loud epic soundtrack.&&Atticus Ross is the name of Reznor's partner. Everybody forgets about him :/&&Trent Reznor works with Atticus Ross. The Nocturnal Animals composer was Abel Korzeniowski.

And while I'm piggybacking on your comment, Mica Levi (Under the Skin, Jackie, and now Marjorie Prime) does great soundtrack work as well. She's really good at creating a mood in her compositions.&&The force awakens had one good piece. Everything else points to the fact that he's getting old. &&I shows up about four times.&&I really like the Hyper Light Drifter OST (but then i like that game just in general).&&Yeah buddy, hopefully *Under the Silver Lake* will come out soon, really don't know much about it besides cast/crew/genre but it's one of my most anticipated films.

And hopefully it'll open the door for Disasterpeace to work with other directors. One movie every 3 years doesn't seem like enough, Zimmer can pump out 6 or 7 a *year*. Pick it up DP!&&I emailed him about his It Follows score. Not only did he reply but we had a brief back and forth about what synths he likes etc. 
He's an exceedingly nice guy.&&She's also doing the soundtrack for Marjorie Prime, a film that looks at AI in a way similar to the film Her.&&Yet Poets of the Fall will be forever in my heart thanks to the first two games of the series. As well as the piano theme melody.&&Making music for games is quite a different process from writing for film though.  Game music generally consists of long, repeating loops matched to whichever level or game mode you're in, but there usually isn't any fixed timeline.  Film music, on the other hand, is matched precisely to the film (or vice versa), all to a fixed timeline.&&[deleted]&&Aping Phillip Glass, such risk.

FWIW I do love the Interstellar score.&&I think I jumped on his bus after I saw Neon Demon. I loved everything about that film for some reason. &&Not to mention,  nobody thinks of that as Zimmer work.&&It wasn't Hans Zimmer who helped arrange the score for Tron: Legacy but Joseph Trapanese.

He later did the same with M83 for Oblivion&&I had never heard of A24 before I found out that Oneohtrix Point Never was doing the soundtrack for a movie (Good Time).  Saw the trailer, looks really good but also kind of Oscar-baity.  A lil heavy on the indie tones. I'm definitely going to see it though because OPN is a fucking genius and the soundtrack alone could make watching paint dry profound.

edit: [now that I think of it OPN probably would have been a great choice for this entirely unnecessary bladerunner movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Dxtn3nAog&t=16s)

also [if you are reading this and haven't heard the album R-Plus Seven, do yourself a huge favor, I don't care who you are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmlJveN9IkI&list=PL_klrOneTjGiioP9_M5lOvfvr_v6iIygv)&&How did it deserve it over Moonlight or La La Land or even Manchester by the Sea? 

It definitely didn't get fucked over because it was a sci-fi. It lost because it wasn't the best film of the year.&&I never mentioned the instrumentality of his music, I just classified his music as instrumental, as in:

>An instrumental is a musical composition or recording without lyrics, or singing, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a Big Band setting. &&Right? Big claim.

I should mention I don't know a single artist mentioned. &&I believe you're correct, though also it's possible the director had seen the PBS miniseries Cosmos which featured Alpha and the aforementioned excerpt from Heaven & Hell.  L'Enfant is sublime in its simplicity, like the score for Nankyoku Monogatari (Antarctica).  Hearing that on a pair of Wilsons at a friend's house was the turning point when I started buying Vangelis' entire catalogue.&&>Cat People sounds absolutely nothing like Blade Runner. Because something has synthesizers doesn't mean it all sounds the same! Uggh.

I was referring to the fact that Chariots of Fire put electronic scores in demand because of the awards potential.  See the part where I explicitly said: ""neither necessarily riffing off the other, but just an example of how that sound was in demand after Chariots of Fire the previous year...""
UGGH.

I know the difference between atmospheres, pulse music, and the like... would you like a five-hour lecture on the modified Zyklus MPS multi-arp controller that Bill Marshall custom built for Vangelis (called DIRECT)?

Maybe you'd like to buy my Sequential Circuits Prophet-5?  It's just like the one Vangelis used at Nemo Studio.
UGGH!

>And the world music influence... also totally unusual for the time.

So you've never heard Isao Tomita's *Snowflakes* or Jarre's *Oxygene*?  Tomita, by the way, was influenced by Wendy Carlos, who scored A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and TRON....  But what do I know about electronic science fiction scores?

UGGH!


P.S. Wendy, who recorded seminal electronic works--the monophonic, multitracked *Switched on Bach* and *Secrets of Synthesis*--used to be Walter Carlos... Robert Moog's research assistant.  Yes, that Moog.

P.P.S.  UGGH!&&You *must* listen to the score for Kureyoshi Kurahara's NANKYOKU MONOGATARI (Antarctica)... it's spellbinding.&&At least some of the alumni are doing great not-entirely derivative stuff on their own. John Powell, the Gregson-Williams brothers, Ramin Djawadi... 

The intern/assistant thing works. It's a great way to slowly build skill. It can lead to derivative music but it doesn't have to.  &&The thing is, Zimmer is truly a phenomenal composer with tons of different styles. He did Lion King, Pirates, Sherlock Holmes, Crimson Tide, and of course Batman, Interstellar, Inception... 

That said, sure, there are plenty of other great composers out there. But it is impossible to ignore that his music has truly embodied the films it was made for. &&It's free! No reason not to.&&Thanks heaps, will have a listen now! Thoroughly enjoying Movement 1 from Soil Festivities at the moment, the synths are beautiful.&&""Memories of Green"" is abso-frickin-lutely fantastic. I've been ever trying to find something like it ever since I've heard it - I've come across themes that touch on parts of it in Il Guardiano Del Faro's ""Lady Moon"" and even Rafael Anton Irisarri's A Fragile Geography - Displacement / Reprisal / Empire Systems, although nothing *really* comes close to Vangelis' blend of simple neo-noir industrial lined with drunken piano of bitterness past.

Seems like Rêve has something along those lines of ""Memories of Green"" !&&Demis!  ""The Four Horsemen"" and ""Rain and Tears"" man.... taking me on a timewarp !&&At least it was interesting temp track.&&Poor Johann - this keeps happening to him. I thought this exact thing when the final scene of Theory of Everything suddenly has *Arrival of the Birds* over it after all he wrote for that film. He's one of my favourite composers working in film today but he seems to struggle (or not want) to write those schmaltzy climatic themes and directors stick with their temp ideas. &&No, safe as in not particularly ambitious or risky, and you don't need to take it as a knock on Zimmer. He's the consummate professional and he's rewarded fairly.&&There's one in production: https://youtu.be/Q6LxTDBtMDs&&Wow that was an amazing and greatly detailed explanation for my question. Thank you for explaining some of the ways it works. It makes sense and actually sounds cool in a lot of ways. Best of luck to you and your music. Hopefully I hear some in trailers. I have heard and liked the Petes Dragon music from trailer. &&God that video is evergreen.All college humor Batman videos were goldmines.&&The Last Samurai especially, is god-tier. It's my moment of zen and peace. Very beautiful. And I'll be damned if Davy Jones' organ doesn't drive a chill down your spine.&&TDK theme is literally the first note of Elfman's batman played over and over&&Well, they wouldn't be able to get the BWAAAAAH sound with just a pinky. &&I said 'maybe' and also different people retire at different ages.&&Psh. John Williams is 85 and he's working on Episode 8 right now.&&Not really.&&No, mentor is correct.&&lahvah&&Frequent collaborator?&&I think it's explained by something like the Pareto principle. He puts it at 80/20 but I think it's much tighter than that. A very small percentage of people in the world produce the vast majority of the creative/intellectual material because they're the ones with the unicorn combination of creativity/intellect AND work ethic.  &&That's exactly it. A lot of ""talent"" simply doesn't understand that you have to produce a sellable product. Often creatives are wired that way, they're usually not  the greatest business people and in some cases have no idea or inclination that they have to deliver, and that takes discipline and organization. All the great rock bands/artists have great managers, agents, producers and roadies, that let them be sucessful. If it was solely down to the artists, they'd still be living in their parents basements.&&To add to this, don't forget some of Hans Zimmer's earlier work. He is fully capable of some very different sounding styles that most people forget about.

Edit: Fixed an incorrect link.&&Obviously, I know that Hans is much more versatile than just the loud percussion. I'm just saying, it has been his most noticeable trait in recent years, not that it is his defining trait or that he doesn't have other tools in the toolbox. I thought Dunkirk had a really different and unique score. I loved how he incorporated the ticking pocket watch. I love how in Inception, for the song that plays on the Tidal Wave Mountain planet with the nutso relative time distortion, he set the track to 60BPM, especially to signify (If I remember correctly) that one tick on the track, which would usually signify a second, actually represents a year. And on top of that, the Interstellar score as a whole is ambient and atmospheric and unique. 

Hans is one of the absolute best composers in the game today. Personally, I love his big percussion tracks, but I also love his more somber, mood setting efforts. As I said, the opening music of BvS with the vocal harmonies on it is absolutely breathtaking. And then, the very next track, A Beautiful Lie, is the perfect track to introduce Bruce Wayne/Batman to. While it definitely gets more energetic later in the piece (Taking cues from The Man of Steel score -- If I recall correctly, it has cues from Zod's theme in it. Percussive and energetic. But not just that. I think Zod's MoS music is iconic. I associate it with some of the very best scenes in the film from the Krypton open to the Smallville brawl to the Metropolis battle and back into Bruce Wayne running into the chaos in BvS. And those cues fit so nicely next to the rest of A Beautiful Lie, which captures the Classic Batman perfectly. It has distinct 1950s Noir-Detective feels to it. 

I think it's cool that Hans has effectively scored 2 entirely different versions of Batman. You've got The Nolanverse Batman music, and there's plenty of examples to pick from, but its all very bold stuff. When I hear his music for the Justice League Batman, it's all a much more Classic 50s Noir throwback. And maybe Affleck helps to sell it better, but damnit, his Bruce Wayne has the look and the feel of someone from that 50s Era. And I absolutely love how Zimmer can differentiate between the dynamics of the differing Batman characters he has scored for. 

I think Hans is probably the best composer out there, today. And YES, I do think that Hans started a trend almost a decade ago and that trend has become the norm. I am glad he is done scoring Superhero movies. I hope that cues from his most recent MoS/BvS work gets referenced in all of the upcoming DCEU films, but as far as Hans contributing fresh works to them, he doesn't need to. He has exhausted the best possible stuff he could create for the genre. 

I look forward to Hans continuing to work with Nolan on all of his films, and I hope that Hans does more Sci Fi works after he scores 2049. Honestly, I would LOVE to hear what Zimmer would attempt in a Star Wars Anthology. I really think he could bring an entirely new dynamic to SW. And I don't think he would need to try to imitate John Williams to do it. I also don't think that he would need to do the crazy drum work, either. Keep in mind, I damn sure don't think he should just forget about using drums LMAO, I just don't think he will have to go overboard. 

I look forward to hearing Hans upcoming works. It's gonna be fun. Also, I am familiar with some of the works that you just posted, and then, there are some that are completely unidentifiable to me. And that's what I'm trying to convey in this HUGE wall of text. I know Zimmer isn't one dimensional. I want that to be loud and clear. I just want him to do some stuff in the future that is completely unlike his more known and more established ""greatest hits"", and I'd like to see THOSE styles becoming trends and then, the norm!&&So I would say the crux of the issue isn't that Zimmer's formula is exclusively ""loud & percussive"". That's definitely an element, but not all of it.

In the majority of the songs you posted, the climax of any of the songs revolves around the exact same thing - 4 chords, repeated over and over, in a 4/4 time signature, gradually getting louder. Some of his songs are ONLY that (here's looking at you, Time) Of course it can be beautiful and there's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's incredibly formulaic (he does it ALL the freaking time) and I would even argue he shouldn't be viewed as the maestro composer that he is.&&Yessssss. Her score to Under the Skin is still one of the most frightening things I've ever experienced in a theater, and that is not an exaggeration. It's a masterwork. The score she wrote for Jackie was really delicate and beautiful too. I know literally nothing about Marjorie Prime, but I've already put it on my watchlist solely because of her.

I can't think of a single other movie composer I've done that for. Hell, I can't think of a single other non-director I've done that for.&&I gotta disagree with you. I absolutely love his score for The Force Awakens. I think he manages to expand on everything that made his score for Revenge of The Sith so damn good. He does a tremendous job blending the original trilogy themes and a few cues from the prequels to make the music for Ep. 7. Rey's Theme is obviously the highlight of the score. For me, it is the most iconic piece of music he's done in well over a decade. Kylo's music has a TON of callbacks to Anakin's themes from Sith, as well as Imperial March. The Scherzo for X-Wings has great energy and is a very heroic piece. The Jedi Steps is another amazing piece. I really think he nailed the magic of Luke's grand reveal. I mean, honestly, the very first significant piece of music in TFA is the Raid on The Jakku Village, which also immediately reminds me of Revenge of The Sith. There's also some cues to Padme's themes throughout. I don't think JW is washed up at all, atleast, not when it comes to Star Wars. 

I think it's most likely that he's had over a decade to think of ideas for more SW music. He already had 6 films worth of reference! And I truly believe that Williams is at his most magical when he is composing for SW. &&Fucking dope, she does melancholy really well. &&man I'm so happy for opn, he blew the fuck up in the past few years (and deservedly so).&&Reminder that the man invented a whole genre of music basically. [Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1](https://youtu.be/unN7QvSWSTo)&&Damn I heard about this movie but wasn't too worried about seeing it but now that I know Oneohtrix is doing the music im going to have to.&&I saw Good Time earlier this week. It is insanely gripping, and the score/sound design is phenomenal. I’ve met the Safdie Bros twice—first at their debut of Heaven Knows What. They’re the filmmakers to to watch, especially since they direct, write, and act in their movies. Ridiculously intelligent people.

Also Robert Pattinson is great in it—he really disappears into the character.&&Moonlight is ridiculously overrated. For a film that takes itself THAT serious, I honestly didn't think the 3rd act/ending was in any way, shape, or form a plausible or realistic outcome. And I won't go any further than that because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.

 Manchester By The Sea is brilliant, but I've seen similar stuff done better. I enjoyed how absurd it was in its execution, though. It's rare that you get a film so dark, so serious, so melancholy, so dry that it becomes downright hilarious. Anyone who ever wanted to make a black comedy, but without any real comedy whatsoever, they should study Manchester. In the same way that Tim & Eric on Adult Swim are funny as hell because everything they do is intent on NOT being funny and being as cringeworthy and as bad as can be, Manchester is the same kind of thing on a black comedy spectrum. It takes all the things that make a dark comedy and strips away any semblance of humor, which in turn, makes it hilarious, in the most dull and morbid and depressing of ways. Casey Affleck deserves all the credit in the world. He carried that film. 

La La Land continues Chazelle's theme of ""People that want to be the absolute BEST at something"" and keeps all his pretentious Jazz love from Whiplash, but manages to churn out something crazily entertaining and uplifting. For the most part, it is a feel good movie. It encapsulates everything that a musical should while also managing to present the main characters and their fascination/desire/passion/profession in a very accurate light. Obviously, the film is about the dreams of dreamers living in a dream land, and it is amazing. It is precise, accurate, bold, beautiful, and touching for anyone who LIVES to CREATE. And of course it was gonna KILL at the Oscars, it is a love letter to the entertainment biz. Honestly, if any film should've beaten Arrival for Best Picture, it was La La Land. 

Arrival DID get shafted because it was sci-fi (I also felt Michael Shannon got shafted for Best Supporting Actor in Nocturnal Animals. But he would garner a nomination from me in almost anything he does. Even when the guy is in a mediocre or outright bad film, he is always on form. He might be the most prolific actor of our time.) But, back to Arrival: It is everything you could want in a film. It takes serious risks. It is an original concept. It is insanely well directed and well acted. I really don't think there was another film up for Best Picture that resonated so well with me (Nocturnal Animals was higher on my list than Moonlight or Manchester. But unfortunately, the Academy hates Tom Ford, for some reason. He made a Hitchcock Noir Thriller for modern audiences. I would've never expected it.) But again, Arrival is my pick. Denis Villanueve has yet to disappoint me in any of his endeavors so far. He knows how to make compelling, thought provoking film, especially Sci-Fi. He is perfect for 2049 & for Dune. And I'd like to see his take on Star Wars one day. The concept of the non-linear timeline in Arrival is simply perfection. The language of the Aliens is easily the coolest and most original I've ever experienced. I truthfully didn't know where the film was headed, but as it progressed, I started to get it, and that 3rd act reveal is some of the best storytelling ever. My ONLY gripe with the film was Forest Whitaker's Token Military Guy. He did his best with the material, but that role could've gone to anyone. And although I am not a huge fan of Renner, he was spot on. Amy Adams, as always, was great. I loved everything she brought to this film. I just think it was a little bit of a wildcard of a movie because of how inclusive the story was. You have to really stick with this film. It keeps your brain working in the best way. None of the other Best Picture Noms did that. No one was close. &&I don't think either of you are right. It didn't get fucked over because every film there had reasons that it deserved to win. I'm so happy that Moonlight won Best Picture. It really, really deserved it. La La Land also would have deserved it, so would Arrival. All of the nominees were great films and I can see the merit in each of them winning best picture. &&Agree to disagree, of all the films of the year it was the best one I watched.&&Look up ""Remote Control Media Productions,"" it's actually true. Or at least partially. Zimmer does at least some of the work himself, but a lot of it is done by his employees, some of whom are reasonably successful composers in their own right and under their own name.&&The scourge part in my mind is that it unfairly screwed the composer of the vast majority of the film out of awards consideration. It was a good score with or without that piece.&&Interstellar is a score mainly with a church organ in it. The Pledge is a lone guitar and a humming girl. I do not agree with anything you say. &&[deleted]&&NOOOO! MISTER FISHY!&&I've never actually seen the Last Samurai, but it's been on my watchlist forever. And yeah, say what you want about the quality of the Pirates movies, but their music is fantastic.&&Only semi-related, but god what a waste of a cool villain Davy Jones was. His character design was really weird, they had a good actor playing him, and his backstory made him more than a supernatural version of Barbossa, even if it was a bit generic. Such a shame that idea was wasted on those two movies.&&That's only a small part of the main motiff, there are a lot of other layers to Batman's theme most notably the choiral arrangements you could hear when the Waynes' were shot and Batman flying over the ocean with the bomb.&&Unfortunate for people trying to break into the industry&&I've read that somewhere before and you're absolutely right. Hans is just as great a salesman, manager and organizer as he is a composer, but the other qualities let him do the latter.&&Can't believe neither of you linked [Gladiator - Now We Are Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBE-uBgtINg). 

It's still his most iconic piece IMO.&&and Beyond Rangoon, Pearl Harbor, The Thin Red Line, Tears of the Sun, Spirit: Stallion&&His [Rain Man theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHsQUGjC1NA) is so atmospheric. If he can bring that kind of atmospheric synthy stuff to Blade Runner it'd be real nice.&&> Da Vinci Code

Zimmer deserves much of the criticism thrown his way, but I ignore it all because he gave the world Che Valiers de Sangreal

It seems like you are applauding Ted Chiang a bit more than Villanueve, as even your Forest Whitaker gripe wasn't based on the original story (really non of the military stuff was). &&I just want to say, that even though I disagree on some of your opinions, they are still spot on. Where you mention negatives sometimes I see a positive.

Cheers,&&I feel your frustration. I'm still pissed that Silence didn't even get a nod.&&Moonlight might be overrated, but definitely not ""ridiculously"". Combining black culture, coming of age, homosexuality, and parental struggles altogether is a serious accomplishment. Also it'd be one thing if the aesthetic was like a TV movie but the stylization was prolific especially considering the low budget

Arrival is extremely well made but ultimately borrows from many mainstream techniques & conventions as opposed to originality. The montage sequence a la The Martian was an eye roller, the interspersed nature shots were like a Malick rip off, the narrative was fun but not significantly better than Tarintino Nolan Lynch Kauffman etc., and every character outside Adams is an inhuman plot device. And while Amy was great her role didn't have cutthroat vulnerability like comparables of recent memory Blue is the Warmest Color, Elle, Carol, etc.&&I don't really agree with Manchester by the Sea being a black comedy. The way it slowly adds context only makes it the lightest at the beginning, and shows how the characters deal with grief. Black comedy is a drama with humor, which makes it just a drama.
&&So like. Opinions then?&&While I love Arrival so, so, so much (top 10 I've ever watched), I think Moonlight and La La Land were slightly better movies.&&Same here. And it was not until watching it a second time just a few months ago that I thought so. Someone I knew [lost a child](#spoiler)... and watching it after that happened made me appreciate the films message 10 fold. 

And of course the whole unity thing with the world being so torn apart. 

I believe Arrival will be remembered for a long time and will hold up. &&It is a pretty common thing to do for successful artists whose name becomes essentially a brand.&&I love the score to Interstellar, but that pipe organ and the score in general were safely derivative in style/orchestration of 2001 and Philip Glass. That's a perfectly normal thing in film music, and in this case it worked really well, the score was hardly ordinary. It's possibly the best score of his career... but that has nothing to do with being super risky or ambitious, it's about the writing itself. You know not every single good thing said about Zimmer's music has to be true, right? It's not even largely up to composers how bold and unique their music can be, so it's not like I blame him (hence my comment about it not being a knock on him).

And of course you can pick counterexamples, but by and large Zimmer can be relied on to make safe scores that get the job done, on time, with high production value. The Pledge may be a good counterexample, sure. Generally though, he is known for creating orchestral hybrid scores where there are like one or two signature instruments or sounds that create a specific sound for that film - guitars, clocks, the infamous braam (Inception is my fave of his), the cimbalom/dulcimer, organ... anyway you get it. You'll probably interpret all of this as an insinuation that he's supposed to do random shit for the sake of it, but it's not. He's one of the best at what he does, full stop.

I hope you don't disagree with the part about him being a professional and fairly rewarded!&&Gotta get a grip !&&Seems to me like his opinion was trusted and it turned out aaaalright
&&I mean... It's only natural. If Zimmer comes up to you and says ""this guy is really talented at making soundtracks, you should hire him"", you're gonna take that with weight. &&That's the way everything works in the real world. Networking.
Seek out and know people in the industry you want to work in. Sending out resumes and portfolios is close to useless.&&As if those people wouldn't accept nepotism were it working to their benefit. Everyone hates nepotism until they're the one getting a job offer from a longtime friend or family member in the business. Unfortunately people are always going to recommend people they know and trust for jobs over a complete stranger, qualifications be damned, unless you plan on regulating that with laws. So networking and being able to not only do your job but also be a people person who works well with clients and is gracious to those who grant them opporunities, will always be a required skill if you want to break into almost any industry, especially one as competitive and exclusive as high-end film scoring.&&Yeah, this (and the others people have mentioned) are all fantastic. It's well worth going through his entire back catalog of scores.&&Agreed. Each of the many times I've re-watched Gladiator, there's the anticipation of the catharsis which that piece underscores and infuses. To me, it's on par with gems such as William's best Star Wars moments or Goldsmith's Star Trek: TNG theme. &&And The Last Samurai. The movie that got me into his work. &&I first got into his work on the same soundtrack (score these days). However, [Leaving Wallbrook / On The Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf3rSNe6eKc) is my favorite.&&Maybe I am. I am not familiar with the source material. I still think Denis made a tremendous picture. And I didn't mind the military element, I thought that made sense. I just think if you cast Whitaker, you should utilize him to the fullest. He really doesn't do anything or say anything of merit. Now take his role in Rogue One as Saw Gerrera. They could've gotten a less high profile actor for Saw, as well. But the difference is, Forest seemed to be having a blast and in his limited screen time, he delivered some really memorable stuff, for me. He's definitely hamming it up, but I buy into it. Stuff like ""LIES. DECEPTION. BOR GULLET WILL KNOW THE TRUTH' or ""'EVERY DAY! MORE LIES"" or ""TODAY.. OF ALL THE DAYS.. JYN!! DID YOU... DID THEY SEND YOU.... TO.. KILL.... MEE?"" -- He is amazing in Rogue One. Now obviously I don't expect him to be anywhere close to that over the top in Arrival, but I would've sure loved it if he was as intense in Arrival as he was as a Washed up-Drunken-Boxing Trainer in Southpaw. He killed that role, too. Arrival is just so bland in regards to Whitaker. It had to be the way they wrote his character. &&It just came out at an awful time. Too close to the awards and its a heavy movie so doesn't attract a lot of attention&&I thought Silence was CRIMINALLY underrated. What's not to love about Scorsese directing The Amazing Spider-Man & Kylo Ren as they try to rescue Qui-Gon Jinn, after he was 'Taken' by Warlords in Feudalistic Japan. It had an awesome premise. Awesome cast. Very well done cinematography. I'll admit it did drag a bit, but it had me interested from start to end.&&Are they also in your top 10 then?&&GIVE THE JOB TO AN UNTESTED ROOKIE!&&Most people only inevitably accept nepotism because they know in a world of nepotism not having it is an unfair disadvantage. &&I saw Moonlight only because of all the Oscar attention and while I thought it was fine I didn't think anything about it was Oscar worthy really. The casting of the different actors over time felt very awkward to me. It was really chaotic because it seemed like they did a poor job of getting older people to play the same character. It really felt like three totally different people - not one person aging. And the third act was borderline comical in my opinion. Ali was fine. Absolutely fine. I have no complaints but his role, while important, is actually kind of small. I expected a much more prolific performance based on the buzz. 

This will be a somewhat controversial comment but I can't help but think Moonlight won because of the racial backlash from the previous year. It felt like a hollow win in my opinion.

I haven't seen La La Land so I can't comment on it but Arrival was brilliant. I was surprised it got as much Oscar attention as it did considering it is Sci Fi but I was glad to see it get so much love. Hopefully this continues and it leads to more sci fi movies like Arrival - beautiful, thought provoking, and original films. &&I've never been so viscerally or emotionally affected by a movie before. My favorite of last year by leaps and bounds. &&Yes.&&Probably should have gone with a top 100.&&Seems to be a theme for the past year&&I pretty much agree with you across the board in regards to Moonlight. It was a stylized, bold, controversial film that pieced together minority struggles with homosexuality and then attempted to stitch the Swiss Cheese plot together through the multiple actor sets. And I agree, a lot of them were downright bad. 

Ali is the shining star of this film. He had a great performance in limited screen time. I think his character, like many characters and plot points in the film, lacked progression, development, and a worthwhile resolution to the established arc of the character. 

If I sit down to watch a film, I want to be entertained. And if the film is heralded as ground-breaking and innovative, I damn sure don't want to be the guy to nitpick it. But in Moonlight's case, it is as if most people refuse to outright admit how much of a flawed film it is, and just how contrived it ultimately became, in favor of blindly praising it. 

I am always going to give an honest opinion of the films I watch. And I would hope that the rest of the people who see a film would make their own assessment about a film, instead of just playing follow the leader. I honestly believe there are people out there afraid to give any bit of criticism to this film because of potential backlash with the African-American and Homosexual communities. I think that is ABSURD. First off, art should never get shoehorned into categories as simplistically defined. But since thats where this is headed, there are plenty of black films and black filmmakers that I adore. I'm sure there are gay filmmakers and films with  homosexual plotlines or gay characters or actors that I enjoy. But just as I am doing with Moonlight, if any of these other works jump the shark, I will speak on it. Moonlight is an average film with out of the box ideas, controversial plot points, overly stylized and nicely packaged for the mass appeal of the now sudden voiceless that don't want to offend anybody, because the film is perceived as breaking new ground. Clap clap. It won. It's still heavily flawed and always will be. I promise you some of the other nominations will age better with time. But props to Jenkins. He has talent. I just think he is capable of more. And if he is? Well, he will either be winning hella Oscars in the years to come or now that he's been acknowledged, his potentialIy better future works will get bypassed or unfairly judged next to Moonlight. Hell, if he will just develop his story more, he can beat Moonlight quality every outing.&&What is your full top 10? I'm always curious to see different peoples lists&&",2017-07-29 14:15:27
