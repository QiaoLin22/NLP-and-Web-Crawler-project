The first film to be screened in Saudi Arabia after a 35-year ban on cinemas was 'The Emoji Movie',86022,7qjmly,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-cinema/saudi-arabia-begins-screening-films-after-decades-long-ban-lifted-idUKKBN1F40QS,3097,1516022488.0,,"Two quick notes:

1) OP's article mentions The Emoji Movie but doesn't make it clear it was the first film screened. [Newsweek however confirms that The Emoji Movie was indeed the first film screened.](http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-screens-emoji-film-one-worst-movies-2017-after-35-year-cinema-ban-781188)

2) Just to be clear movies weren't banned, cinemas were banned. Also the government does plan to censor any ""objectionable"" material from any films. (Cue jokes about censoring entire Emoji Movie) &&And so begins another 35 year ban &&hey start from the bottom work your way up to the good stuff right?&&/r/nottheonion &&Makes sense.

""Do you really want to know what 'western' social, religious and economic freedoms give you?  Fine.  Here it is....""&&Haven't those poor people suffered enough?&&I heard it was it was between this, The Room, The Last Airbender and Dragonball Evolution.&&It's like giving a bottle of piss to thirsty man in desert&&It’s like being on a diet for a long time and your first cheat day is a salad with fat free dressing you got on sale in the clearance bin. &&This is the first time I've ever heard of an entire country getting trolled.&&Saudi here. I'm gonna watch this movie at the movie theater, next to my friends, and I'm gonna eat my popcorn, and drink my soda, and I'm gonna be annoyed when people talk over, and I'll probably have an enormous urge to leave the theater while watching this piece of shit, and I'm gonna be shitting all over it afterwards. But, I'm so fucking glad that I can finally do that.
EDIT: Gold? Thank you much kind stranger.&&That sure is a good way to make sure people never go back to the movies &&""We are putting the ban back. Nothing of value was made in the last 35 years."" - KSA&&The ban was immediately reimplemented.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, stranger! ^^^^and ^^^^letting ^^^^me ^^^^fix ^^^^my ^^^^spelling ^^^^error&&It's only 10am and this is the saddest thing I am going to read all day.&&Great, now they've spoiled the magic of going to the cinema for the poor lads.

First movie to be screened in 35 Years, 

Emoji Movie..&&*ABSOLUTELY HARAM*&&Still, it's fucking sweet that there is a cinema playing movies in Saudi Arabia. Just because baby steps aren't giant leaps doesn't mean we should condemn them.

&&Those poor, poor souls. &&What if they compare every movie from now on to the Emoji Movie. Every movie will either be amazing or terrible compared to it.&&Not like they ain't used to seeing heads without bodies&&Eh, this is incredibly inaccurate..

There has been screenings in private or semi-private institutions (like this one) before. Open to the public too. But licenses for dedicated cinemas aren't going to be handed out until March.&&Salman of Saudi Arabia: People of Saudi Arabia! You have wished for Western civilization.  Here it is.  I hereby give you Western civilization movies! They call it Hollywood!

(jeers and boos)

People: What is this? Is this Western civilization movies? We don't want this!

Salman: People! This is Western civilization! Look how meek they are! We are the supreme people!&&How embarrassing &&Ah, yes, the classic Emoji Movie. What a delight for our Saudi Arabian movie enthusiasts. I'm so jealous.&&They censored the movie also to be more in line with their government propaganda. They might have actually made it watchable.&&I'm guessing the Saudis chose it off a recommendation from one jacksfilms.&&I literally just googled this because I didn’t believe it was true. 

No movies and no boozing, no wonder public stonings and floggings are so popular there. Christ knows there’s nothing else to do&&oof&&Ban reissued indefinitely.&&Your country hasn't heard any music made after 1945?

Here, try some Nickleback!&&How did I not know cinemas were banned in Saudi Arabia?  Holy shit that seems archaic wtf, everything I hear about this country sounds like it’s 1800&&What better way to bring movies back than with this masterpiece?

Teen: Uh dad, that's the poop emoji. 

Father: THE WHAT?!&&...and another 35-year band was immediately implemented&&They can only go up from here!&&They then immediately banned cinemas again. &&You know what, keep the ban&&Was this someone's cruel joke?&&Dear saudi arabia,
       Im sorry.&&That’s a good way to earn another 35-year ban. &&Honestly, I used to have a really negative attitude toward Saudi Arabia, but what really changed my mind was I got reamed out by a marine in his 40s-50s after me and my friends made some distasteful comments about the country and it's people. He said that the generosity and hospitality of the Saudi people is second to none of the 20 countries he's visited in the world. This happened in front of a bar/restaurant full of people, some who added to it as my friends tried to argue with him about the unfair treatment of women... One of his marine buds who stood up said almost verbatim: *""in our country, we treat women like sex objects.. In their country, they treat women like prized trophies.. Yes, it's objectionable as well, but we can only learn to respect other's if we can come to understand that not every culture is the same and chooses to live using their God given free-will the same.""*

We were so humiliated we got up and left as people clapped, some who were our own age.&&starved for 35 years and the first thing they serve you is a plate of diarrhea&&I'm sorry, Saudi Arabia... :(&&Frankly, I wouldn't blame them for this one.&&Seriously though, who the fuck dropped the ball on this one? Hell, this stupid shit is less dropping the ball and more shooting the ball across the universe on a one way rocket that you aimed in the opposite direction of your intended freaking target.&&The first cinema to show movies in 35 years was burned down today .....&&""put me back in"".&&Wow. Seriously? You might even be right with such a shit choice.

Light fare is not a poor choice for a culture deprived society. But damn, pick something universally appealing, not appalling.&&Hopefully if only that movie &&Exactly. They should just keep releasing slightly less terrible movies. Imagine a country full of people where every new movie they see is the best one they've ever seen. You'll have some amazing and passionate filmmakers coming out of there in ~15 years.&&You misarranged the words bottom and good stuff

edit: dyselxia&&Next up, emoji 2, electric bugaboo




By popular demand!!&&Aladdin would have been good. &&Honestly a great move on their part &&yeah I wonder how many movies they are going to have to edit to not show any type of nudity or kissing. I wonder if Rated R movies are going to be banned there. I went over there last year and their advertisements on packages was bad enough. They scribbled out all the women or there were no women on any cover of the packaging. &&I certainly can't think of a better personification of Western culture than Patrick Stewart voicing a piece of shit. &&Of course you do realise that they have been able to watch films right, they have had Netflix!&&If you’ve never seen a movie before I bet the Emoji Movie seems lit.

The issue with the movie is that it’s painfully cliche and formulaic. Honestly looks like they found their audience. 

Edit: Stop telling me that Saudis watch other movies outside the cinema. I choose to believe they’ve been watching nothing but live action plays and puppet shows until now. &&And they immediately banned movies again for 35 years.&&Should have gone for Sausage Party then.&&Reminds me of the TIL post about how the grapes of wrath was screened in The Soviet Union as anti American propaganda to show how poor and bad it was except it backfired as the poor Americans had cars. If true that TIL is. 

Also reminds me of another TIL if true was about a North Korean defector or soldier or something was given a stainless steel nail clipped as a gift from an American and when he realized that the previous owner wasn't worried about it, he planned his defection or he found it on patrol and when there was no search party or hubbub about something so ""precious"" missing he started to doubt the government&&I mean... the Saud men are rich and have it better than I would say anyone in the world. Not so much the women and Phillipine workers, but I doubt they go to the cinema anyway.&&This is going to radicalize sooooo many terrorists.&&[lol](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/saudi-arabia)&&[deleted]&&The Room would have been entertaining at least&&You forgot Eragon.&&At least The Room is a great American film made by a great American actor from New Orleans &&They didn't even consider Battlefield Earth?

&&If I had gone through a 35 year ban on movies, I might legitimately enjoy the Emoji Movie as I would have nothing good to compare it to.

Aladdin's probably not it, though.&&Fun fact: Aladdin is actually set in China&&You imbeciles Aladdin takes place in Agrabah. &&To be fair the original story of Aladdin includes an entire passage for the sole purpose of trashing on Jews.

This applies to the entire human species. We hate it. We have documented proofs as to why that movie is a bad movie with bad decisions throughout... And yet.

The end &&Royale*&&Rosebud&&It's still cannon, though. Even though Welles tried to distance himself from the project, there are aspects debuted in the Christmas Special that were reiterated in later, official cannon. The design of Walter Park Thatcher's homeworld, where the framing device for the entire program takes place, was depicted the same way in later iterations of CK despite no prior depictions existing. I heard Orson tried to track down and destroy all extant copies, but you can still find bootlegs at any convention. &&Actually, it has a reason. Before greenscreen, movies used a system called ""rear projection"", where they would project a scene in a giant screen behind the set to make it seem larger. They used it a lot with car scenes, and in this case with Citizen Kane, simulating a party in a swamp. The thing is that the filmmakers reused a rear proyector for this scene from another movie called ""Son of Kong"". What the didn't realiced is that this projection was made for a Kong movie, and hence, it has pterodactyls flying around the jungley setting. You can see that particular scene [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QyRksgacik)

EDIT: I have to add that this claim isn't actually confirmed, and probably it is more of an urban legend than an actual fact.

Tom Hanks to Play Mr. Rogers in ‘You Are My Friend’,83661,7tudsh,http://variety.com/2018/film/news/tom-hanks-mr-rogers-you-are-my-friend-tristar-1202676746/,2694,1517250673.0,,"I wrote about this once, but Mr. Rogers saved my mother's sanity. 

My brother was sick as a child and needed to see specialists who couldn't really give my mother a real diagnosis. Psychiatric conditions? Allergies? Neurological? Whatever it was, my brother was in a lot of pain and the ONLY thing that could routinely calm him and keep him happy was to watch Mr. Rogers. We'd watch it together every afternoon, my mom called PBS and they *sent* her VHS of the episodes. 

I don't know why, but she wrote him a letter thanking him. A couple of weeks later my mother receives a letter back. It's a typed letter and she assumes a form letter, but she reads it. The letter discusses how much he loves to read letters and how my brother's condition is exacerbated by the fact that doctors forget that children are children. It's a long letter - a full page - and references things my mother wrote. It's signed, in ink ""Fred Rogers."" 

My mother still has that letter, it's in a box, she had it framed. It was getting bleached, so she's put it somewhere where it won't deteriorate. My brother's condition was diagnosed and treated. That was more than 30 years ago, but that letter was *never* forgotten. I remember her taking it out when Fred Rogers died and we all read it. 

It's one of those things that seems so trivial, but at the time probably meant the world to my mother and for that, I will always have a hard time reading about Mr. Rogers and not tearing up. I bought copies of his show to show my son because years later, it's the only thing worth watching. It never took children for granted, and even I love watching him. Looking forward to sharing that with my son. 
&&*The film is inspired by a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and award-winning journalist Tom Junod. In the story, a cynical journalist begrudgingly accepts an assignment to write a profile piece on the beloved icon and finds his perspective on life transformed.*

-Fred Rogers


Edit: Formatting&&I hear it was between him and Snoop Dogg&&I can't wait to cry for two hours straight during this movie.&&Fred Rogers was one of thee most special humans ever. I can remember being a small child and realizing this guy fucking cares about me and my future. This guy cares about humans. 

He molded me to be the best version of myself but like many others as I got older I got colder. Kids were and still are atrocious to each other in elementary school. Then you mix puberty with middle/high school peer pressure and you become something foreign to your previous self. Only now in my early 30s can I actually understand what Mr. Rogers was saying to me and the ideals he instilled in me are indeed still there just hidden under years of negative influences, politics, anger, drugs, alcohol, media. Fred knew that kids brains were being rotted out from television so instead of protesting it he found strength in it. 

Im not a religious man but Ive heard a saying that one cannot be a Christian, only strive to be. One cannot be on Mr Rogers level of peace, tranquilty, acceptance and love. One can only strive to remember his pure and beautiful way of viewing humanity because it's seems unobtainable in the world we live in today.

Knock this one out of the park Tom Hanks. Multiple generations will be watching. 

&&Still my favorite Mr Rogers story:

""Mr Rogers drove the same old Chevy Impala for years, until one day the car was stolen. After filing a police report, newspapers and media outlets in the area picked up the story.

Amazingly, within 48 hours the car was left in the exact spot where it was taken from, with a note on the dashboard.

It read, 'If we'd known it was yours, we never would have taken it.'""&&His Senate testimony to get funding for PBS really is amazing.  He wins over a jaded senator in 6 minutes.  Dude really was the nicest,  most wholesome man in existence.  

https://youtu.be/fKy7ljRr0AA&&Mr. Rogers is one guy who might have been too nice to make an interesting bio.  
What kind of drama do you think Hollywood will invent to make the story more appealing to the masses?&&[deleted]&&What's next?  Keanu Reeves playing Bob Ross???  The Rock playing...himself???&&After seeing Forest Gump, Sully and Captain Phillips I’m convinced Tom Hanks can take on persona and do it some damn good justice. The question is, how many more times is a Tom Hanks movie gonna make me cry? &&Perfect casting. Tom Hanks is so talented he could crap on a plate and serve it to us cold with grass clipping and it would still be amazing. &&Tom hanks is a great actor no thought about that. 

I've seen a news video about mr. Rogers on here a while back and he had a striking resemblance to Ed Norton.&&I read this as ""Tom Hardy to Play Mr. Rogers in 'You Are My Friend'. and I'm not gonna lie, I didn't even question it. Dude's such a versatile actor I accepted that Mad Max could play Mr. Rogers no problem. &&YOU ARE MY FRIEND!!! AHHH!!!&&Interestingly; Hanks woke up from a freakish nightmare in the Film The Burbs, only to be watching Mr. Rogers on TV...

You're welcome.&&I'm not a smart man, but I like you just the way you are.&&/r/wholesomemes &&I'll allow it.&&/r/TheChurchofRogers&&This is gonna be amazing. Long live mr. Rogers&&They better be donating a healthy portion of the earnings to PBS. I won't be paying to see this otherwise (I donate monthly to PBS before anyone calls me out). &&Im a huge fan of T Hanks, but man. He just does not carry the same vestiges of Mr.Rogers wholesomeness that come from the voice and character that the man epoused so naturally. It'll take more then a sweater and a hairstyle to convince me. I'm talking weight loss, voice coaching, and mannerisms regiment. I am sure he has the ability to do so but the room for error on this icon is **SLIM** for my money.&&Is it just me, or for once, does anyone else think that Tom Hanks does not have the acting ability/real good humanity in him to match that of the real Mr. Rogers?

I know Tom Hanks is an awesome guy, but Rogers *WAS ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL, DUDE*.&&>The film is inspired by a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and award-winning journalist Tom Junod. In the story, a cynical journalist begrudgingly accepts an assignment to write a profile piece on the beloved icon and finds his perspective on life transformed.

Oh thank god. I was wondering what sort of secret struggles Mr Rogers had in his life, but it looks like the journey in the film isn't his.&&Mr. Fred Rogers is the most beloved human being of all time. Not one person has anything bad to say about him, people thats never even grew up watching his shows have nothing but good things to say. 


Now I'm not religious but an old joke I love is when you die and get to heaven the first thing you will hear is ""Well hello neighbor"" &&I know nothing is sacred for Hollywood but for some reason this was the only dude I would not want an actor to portray on screen. &&When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” - Mr. Rogers&&Arguably the best song of that show:

You are my friend

You are special

You are my friend

You're special to me.

You are the only one like you.

Like you, my friend, I like you.

In the daytime

In the nighttime

Any time that you feel's the right time

For a friendship with me, you see

F-R-I-E-N-D special

You are my friend

You're special to me.

There's only one in this wonderful world

You .... are ..... special.

You know, there's many ways to define ""genius"". Mr. Rogers was a genius of emotional intelligence.&&The best and most wholesome casting choice ever.&&I'd say that even Ton Hanks isn't *quite* up to playing this role, but if I did so in front of Mr. Rogers then he'd no doubt gently correct me. So I won't. Good luck Tom. Because... [well.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA)&&Tom Hanks basically playing himself?&&Not sure if I agree with this. I don't believe Tom Hanks could emulate Fred Rogers' voice, which was the most distinct thing about him outside of the sweaters/sneakers.&&When I was a kid I considered Mr. Rogers to be a substitute grandfather. I never met my biological grandfathers, and my step-grandfather passed when I was a toddler. Mr. Rogers was no doubt the strongest older-male presence in my life. Whenever I had the chance, I would watch his program — even into my teenage years. I have no doubt that I am a better person because of Mr. Rogers’ influence. 

If anyone hasn’t seen it, you should check out Mr. Rogers’ full speech to the Senate regarding PBS funding. Its a tremendous lesson in quiet confidence, clarity, and persuasion.&&if Tom messes this up - will we still love him?&&[deleted]&&a letter like that isn't trivial <3
thanks for sharing the story&&I once read that Mr. Rogers read and responded to every single letters he received.

I am sure he received a ton of letters, but I wish I had written him to share my personal thanks.&&That's simply beautiful! If your family is ever comfortable posting that letter (or a version with anything too personal removed) I'd love to read it! Regardless, thanks for sharing your story.&&As A Brit I haven't really seen much of Mr Rogers but I did watch him testify in front of Congress re the importance of PBS and he honestly exudes sincerity and warmth. Britain has a lot of icons but I don't know who our equivalent would be.&&Mister Rogers is one of my heroes. If you want to read more about his personal life and story, I’d recommend, “The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers.” Imho, he is one of the best examples of how to translate Christian worldview in a way everyone can understand. He influenced millions in encouragement, love, and identity without a “Jesus stamp” on it. Yet Jesus was at the center of everything he did.  In addition, the current show, “Daniel Tigers neighborhood” is the animated version of Mister Rogers puppet characters but filled with the same values as the original show.

And my dad spoke just as gently as he did and took great delight in making people feel better about themselves.

FUCK. The world has been shitty lately and a mass viewing of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood would help us all be better people.

Okay, i feel better but still crying&&Just remember to hydrate.&&I'm crying now. Something about peoples stories of things he said and did just get to me.

The wholesomeness is overwhelming.&&I know I'm like, ""Ok, how can I not embarrass my kids by audibly sobbing the entire time?""&&I'd like to have a Nick Offerman esk show that also takes place in Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, just a few doors down.

It's not his story, really.  

He's not going to be changing, or creating drama with his poor decisions or unstable emotions... The drama will come from the journalist, who will have a dramatic arc from asshole to non-asshole.  

It will be a story about faith in God... doubting, then struggling to accept, then accepting, then having ones past lack of faith cause negative repercussions in the present even though one has accepted God... then not wanting to continue to accept God because he didn't solve the problems one had already created... Then solving or accepting ones own issues and moving forward with the faith.  

Though God here is Mr. Rogers, and the faith-seeker is the journalist.

It'll be kinda like Groundhog Day... The Journalist will be Bill Murray.  Mr. Rogers will be the always-good love interest... But instead of a near-eternity of living the same day, the journalist will experience Mr. Rogers acting like Mr. Rogers in a number of different situations.  &&Maybe it turns out that he's the second coming of Jesus Christ.&&That's facinating you bring this up. As somebody who is likes to study script and story structure, I think the only way to do it is to pull more drama and character focus towards the people in his life and the drama will be the internal conflict the reporter has and the story will probably use Rogers as the solution to that conflict. I imagine it won't be a passive camera following the story between the two but more of a camera that will focus on the perspective of the reporter.

I have not read the script but just by using basic story structure and information in this article, we can plot out a broad strokes assessment of what telling a story like this would entail.

Act 1 (First 20-30 minutes or so)
1. Introduce reporter
2. Illustrate his cynical pessimistic look at the world
3. Introduce the McGuffin of him being assigned a story he doesn't want.
4. Introduce Mr. Rogers
5. Immediately show how different they are.
6. End Act 1 with a mild conflict

Act 2 (Middle 40-50 minutes or so)
1. The reporter tries to find superficial things to prove his preconceived notions
2. Doesn't find them in Mr. Rogers.
3. Progressively illustrate with each bigger and deeper issue the reporter discusses, Mr. Rogers will have an eloquent and wholesome spin
4. Climax with Mr. Rogers using some real wholesome Dad-like wisdom to cut through like a knife about how you don't have to be what the world tells you and everything is perspective.. yadda yadda yadda

Act 3: (Final 15-20 minutes or so)
1. The reporter realizes the errors to his pessimism and slowly starts to blossom as a new person progressively opening more and more up to Mr. Rogers philosophy on life and how to live it.
2. Ends with some illustration of how they stayed friends for a long time or some shit like that. Maybe some poignient message about how being nice isn't that hard and to look for the good in people.

Throw in some mention of past life events and that's pretty much it. I could be completely wrong and I probably am but it was still fun trying to plot this movie out. I'm excited for this. Tom Hanks does great with these types of characters. It reminds me of his portrayal of Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks. I think this will be the most Tom Hanksian role of all time unless some day Tom Hanks decides to do the ultimate Hanks role and play himself in a movie.&&>Nice guy plays *THE NICEST GUY*.

*FTFY*&&John Cena as John Cena?&&I hope that they don't have a scene of Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers peeing somewhere.&&Fecal matter reduction, served chilled with steel-cut plant shavings (50)&&he should probably lose a few pounds for the role though &&Norton would have been good. He plays a similar character in Death to Smoochy.&&""Oh what a day, what a lovely day...in the neighborhood""&&""No-one cared who I was until I put on the sweater.""&&I can’t believe I had to scroll this far down to find this reference. &&I came to the comments just for this&&I fucking knew it. It had to be here somewhere. &&Scrolled way too far to see this mentioned. The Burbs is one of my all time favorite films! &&/r/wholesomememes &&Mr. Rogers, what was it like contacting Tom Hanks from the grave about portraying you on screen?&&Uh..  Guys?  Should we tell him?&&I agree. I'm not saying Tom Hanks can't pull this off, but his looks and his voice are too far off from Mr. Rogers that I can't really see it working. 

If he were still alive, I think Jimmy Stewart would've been perfect for the role, though we'd have to ignore the irony of Stewart playing a biopic of Mr. Rogers since Stewart is actually 20 years older (Stewart was born in 1908, Mr. Rogers in 1928). Not only is Stewart still viewed as a wholesome star even today, he actually physically resembles and sounds more like Mr. Rogers than Tom Hanks does; I'm particularly thinking of Jimmy Stewart in his 50s-60s, around the time when his hair was graying and he starred in *Rear Window* and *Vertigo*. I think that would've worked better.  &&If Tom Hanks doesn't have it in him to portray the humanity of Mr. Rogers, then I don't know who would. Others might look more like Fred Rogers or sound more like him, but Tom Hanks is the only actor I can think of who can come close to seeming as purely nice as Mr. Rogers did.&&Yes. Because Fred Rogers would want us to, and if we don't, we're not being the people he knew we could be.&&It was complex food allergies that cause a host of symptoms. At the time, they were little understood and most doctors didn't believe they were real until a landmark book came out in 1995 - effectively he can't eat food dye, many complex sugars and wheat. He's learned to eat around those things, but as a child, especially in the 80s and food labeling laws were different, he couldn't and it was really bad. &&There seems to be very little that man (Mr. Rogers) did that was trivial. The world needs more men like that. &&I wrote him a letter as a child and he responded directly to what I had written (much more trivial, about my rock collection or something).  I'm sure my parents still have it somewhere too.&&He was such a big part of my childhood; I wish I would have written him to let him know. What an amazing person he was ♡&&I'll try and get my dad to scan it to me. &&
Not in the children's education TV sector, but if you consider Mr. Rogers as actually surpassing this and is in fact a much loved American institution, then David Attenborough is kind of a British equivalent. &&I lived in the U.K., and honestly there isn't a good equivalent. Mr. Rogers was educational, informative and entertaining. It was a rare mix of things and he was phenomenally popular in the U.S. & Canada - it's still the only kids show I can think of that doesn't take children to be stupid. &&I can't recommend that article highly enough.

Anyone who has the time should definitely read it.&&>Once upon a time, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn't like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn't a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn't know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, ""Oh, my, that's a big sword you have,"" the boy didn't answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, ""Oh, honey, c'mon, that's Mister Rogers,"" and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn't like this, he was probably just tired…. Except that Mister Rogers wasn't going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were rings of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy's eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, ""It's not a sword; it's a death ray."" A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knewyou could do it….And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, ""Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?"" But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy's eyes and whispering something in his ear—something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes.

> ""Oh, I just knew that whenever you see a little boy carrying something like that, it means that he wants to show people that he's strong on the outside.

Maybe it was something he needed to hear.""

Good God.&&""You were a child once, too"".

I love this article. Reminds me of taking my 6-month-old daughter on a cross-country flight. Unbeknownst to me, she had an ear infection which resulted in screaming all descent. I nearly cried myself apologizing to all the passengers around me, until one nice old man looked at me and said, ""Don't worry, we were all babies once.""

&&Tom Junod is a *phenomenal* writer. Like, one of the best of our time. If you want to keep crying, be sure to read [his piece about 9/11 and the Falling Man](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a48031/the-falling-man-tom-junod/)&&That really is a great read. I'm only about halfway through, but I'll have to finish it later. I don't really need to be crying in a quiet school hallway.&&Nothing like having a good cry on a Monday. The negative forces in this world will never stop. But for me it’s enough to remember that if you can be kind and loving, then that’s enough for the people in your own life, and maybe they’ll be more kind and loving to the people in their lives too. It’s never too late.&&Important to remember that we were all children once. Too many people lack empathy, especially for children.

Sidenote: Mr. Rogers was an avid swimmer and only weighed 143 pounds. Knew he was skinny, but that is straight up wirey.&&[deleted]&&> Once upon a time, a man named Fred Rogers decided that he wanted to live in heaven. Heaven is the place where good people go when they die, but this man, Fred Rogers, didn't want to go to heaven; he wanted to live in heaven, here, now, in this world, and so one day, when he was talking about all the people he had loved in this life, he looked at me and said, ""The connections we make in the course of a life—maybe that's what heaven is, Tom. We make so many connections here on earth. Look at us—I've just met you, but I'm investing in who you are and who you will be, and I can't help it.""&&Wow.

I don't know why, but I instantly teared up when I read when Mr. Rogers said to the boy. I can't wait to get home from work and hug my son. &&Thank you.&&wait, why the fuck did this kid throw his rabbit out the window TWICE?&&This article made me tear up a bit at just how *good* Mr. Rogers was.

Thank you for sharing.&&Dad wasn’t around when I was a kid. From all the public broadcasting I watched at a young age what I remember best was truly enjoying watching him.

> He is losing, of course. The revolution he started—a half hour a day, five days a week—it wasn't enough, it didn't spread, and so, forced to fight his battles alone, Mister Rogers is losing, as we all are losing. He is losing to it, to our twenty-four-hour-a-day pie fight, to the dizzying cut and the disorienting edit, to the message of fragmentation, to the flicker and pulse and shudder and strobe, to the constant, hivey drone of the electroculture…and yet still he fights, deathly afraid that the medium he chose is consuming the very things he tried to protect: childhood and silence.&&Oh God yes. I'll never forget that article&&Thank you for sharing. I'm glad I took the time to read that.&&I have worked a six hour shift already, and I have seven hours of class and a recording to do after that, and the very last thing I needed was to cry on the bus.

1)  Make a documentary.  NO OLIVER STONE SLANTED PERSPECTIVE documentary.  We have plenty of footage from his time in real life and his show to do it.

2)  Interview all the people he has touched in his life.  Friends, Family, children that were on his show, everybody.  Get interviews with them and let them tell their stories of their experiences with him.

3)  Tell the story of his life how he saved PBS, saved personal video recording devices, everything.

4) MOST IMPORTANT:  Proceeds go to The Fred Rogers Center.

That's how you do this if Tom Hanks doesn't have it in him.

We realized what it was only because his eczema worsened after he had an orange or red ice pop, and none of the others. He was allergic to a bunch of other things but that was the worst. Frustratingly enough red 40 is in liquid benedryl, exactly what you would take for an allergic reaction. They finally make it dye free now.&&I’ve heard a lot of skepticism about food allergies and how they’re a “new thing”, kids 20, 30, 50 years ago didn’t have allergies like we have now, it’s just snowflake kids and snowflake parents. 


It does seem that allergies are more common, and there may be science behind it. But I think people forget about kids (and adults) like your brother, who may never have gotten answers to the pain and reactions they suffered. How many people had health issues that we just didn’t know were a result of allergies?&&I have a friend who had similar issues. He even racked up a million dollars in medical bills(thankfully largely covered by insurance). He would get excruciating stomach pains anytime he ate sugars or wheats. It wasn’t until he was 17 that they figured it out. Poor guy. &&I wish I knew, I would have written him.&&Please tell him to scan it anyway.

I first read it maybe 7 years ago, and it really kind of changed my life.  I still think about it all the time.

Although Junod does have some other great articles, I think this is the best thing he ever wrote.

Cheers, dude.&&From the article:

>At first, the boy was made very nervous by the thought that Mister Rogers was visiting him. He was so nervous, in fact, that when Mister Rogers did visit, he got mad at himself and began hating himself and hitting himself, and his mother had to take him to another room and talk to him. Mister Rogers didn't leave, though. He wanted something from the boy, and Mister Rogers never leaves when he wants something from somebody. He just waited patiently, and when the boy came back, Mister Rogers talked to him, and then he made his request. He said, ""I would like you to do something for me. Would you do something for me?"" On his computer, the boy answered yes, of course, he would do anything for Mister Rogers, so then Mister Rogers said, ""I would like you to pray for me. Will you pray for me?"" And now the boy didn't know how to respond. He was thunderstruck. Thunderstruck means that you can't talk, because something has happened that's as sudden and as miraculous and maybe as scary as a bolt of lightning, and all you can do is listen to the rumble. The boy was thunderstruck because nobody had ever asked him for something like that, ever. The boy had always been prayed for. The boy had always been the object of prayer, and now he was being asked to pray for Mister Rogers, and although at first he didn't know if he could do it, he said he would, he said he'd try, and **ever since then he keeps Mister Rogers in his prayers and doesn't talk about wanting to die anymore, because he figures Mister Rogers is close to God, and if Mister Rogers likes him, that must mean God likes him, too.**&&Try to love everyone you meet tomorrow.

I mean I do get his point about Video Game Movies being terrible.

Hell just get John St. John to do it.&&And here I thought Cena was looking more like a fit for B.J. Blazkowicz

&&Hail to the King baby, come get some! Despite my disappointment with Duke Nukem Forever, This has the potential to be a fun show.&&I guess that’s why JC posted a picture of Duke on instagram. 

But I doubt a lecherous male who bangs all the women will be popular in 2018. &&It's going to have to be a HARD R, bordering NC17&&I'm calling it now:


* Rated PG-13


* Duke will be more of a secondary character, next to...


* A nerdy-but-dreamy-older-teen, and his tomboyish love interest who's only in the film to show everyone ""Hey, girls can kick ass too!""


* A **BIG** sassy black woman who don't need no man, she just need to chime in with forced one-liners every couple of minutes, i.e: beating a Pig Cop with a frying pan while screaming “Imma go aw N Dubya A on yo ass!”


* A talking chihuahua with a stereotypically Mexican accent that would make Cheech Marin cringe


* Hell lets pull a bunch of random traits out of a hat and build a half dozen other new characters. Who wants to see Duke Nukem in a movie called ""Duke Nukem""?


* Duke will not say a single fucking one of his famous one liners, in order to avoid lawsuit against the film. Nor will he use any of his classic weapons.


* They're also going to really scale back Duke's rowdy lifestyle, with the other characters constantly pulling him away from fucking every woman he sees, so he can focus on saving the world, also to stick with the PG-13 rating.


* Speaking of saving the world, the plot will probably revolve around stopping the bad guys from getting a cube/sphere/some other shape, that ""holds great power"".


* Most of the bad guys will be human henchmen, to cut back on the CGI budget. You will see a couple Pig Cops and the main bad guy will be a Battlelord (they're saving the Overlord for the sequel and the Cycloid Emperor for the end of the trilogy).


* Most of the action scenes will be so fast and have so many cuts, you won't have any fucking clue what's going on. Don't worry though, 85% of the movie is about random filler, starring the side characters.

&&I'll watch it and enjoy in the same way I enjoyed the Doom movie.&&Fuck it, I'll be the one to say it: does John Cena seem too nice to play Duke Nukem? To me, Duke was like the last bit of unironic 80s macho-ness you could hobble together, while Cena seems way too nice of a guy for the role. But hey, maybe my opinion is far too spurned by seeing Cena demolish those Make A Wish appearance records and [thoughtful insight on having a gay coworker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIdT2LJpavo) for me to see him as anything other than a true gentleman.&&* Super Mario Bros
* Dead or Alive
* Double Dragon
* Alone in the Dark
* Far Cry
* In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale
* Wing Commander
* House of the Dead
* Postal
* Bloodrayne
* Street Fighter (Live action version)
* Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li
* Mortal Kombat (To be fair, it's a victim of when it was made)
* Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
* Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
* The Tomb Raider series
* Most of the Resident Evil series
* Prince of Persia: Sands of Time
* The Angry Birds Movie
* Assassins Creed

### How could this movie POSSIBLY be bad?!&&I'll take ""headlines nobody wants to read"" for five hundred, Alex.&&I think Justin Lin would be perfect to helm this movie.

Also if they somehow incorporate a voice cameo from Jon St. John and the original Duke Nukem theme I'm gonna nut.&&Unpopular opinion: I enjoyed Duke Nuke Forever&&If there’s one character Michael Bay can do justice, it’s Duke Nukem.&&You know what, fuck it. Might as well get some more use out of my moviepass now&&Oh god. I am gonna call it now.

- PG13

-  braindead even for Duke Nukem standards

- Duke will be some PC version of himself. AKA, John Cena with guns and not Duke Nukem at all.

- But hey explosions.&&You guys are putting too much stock on the ""Michael Bay"" part of this. It's just being done by his production company, which lately has produced The Purge 3, Ouija 2, The Purge 4, and A Quiet Place.&&This needs to happen.
 Just have him randomly keep groping the walls here and there for seemingly no reason, until somewhere in the film he touches something mundane like a small vase or something and a secret door to a jetpack and a huge gun opens.&&Unh...
Unh...
Where is it...
Unh
&&Scene... As in singular?!?! I think he's gonna need to go through the whole movie pressing on every wall like an OCD fly. Only taking breaks to shoot aliens, reload, and make crude comments about da ladies&&If it’s this self aware and meta I would see it in a heartbeat.

In case anyone hasn't seen this masterpiece. I just spent ten minutes laughing like a madman even though I've seen it a hundred times. Hard to believe it's 10 years old... Shit. &&A classic&&[you have just been bent from the vent server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE3KdcTgrno)&&I laughed so fucking hard at this!!! I could hear the sound clip tpaying in my head like I was a kid all over again. If I could give more upvotes, you would get them all.&&His entire moviemaking career was leading to this. &&Seriously, It'll probably get 35% on rotten tomatoes, but I'll still watch it&&That or a Call of Duty film universe. &&yeah i saw the title and went WOW that is the most predictable no shit things i have heard all year.&&What about ass?&&That just reminds me Roddy Piper is dead.&&IT'S TIME TO KICK GUM AND CHEW ASS

AND I'M ALL OUT OF ASS.&&Hahaha. Dick Kickem.&&I’ll just leave [this](http://imgur.com/DDjUWc5) here. &&The Bad Boys movies and Pain & Gain are relatively hard R.&&[deleted]&&Bay did an amazing R rated movie - the 13 Hours Benghazi flick. It's honestly on the same level of greatness as Black Hawk Down. Pretty sure it's on Prime right now. &&> I hope this is R though.. blood is important to Duke.

They should censor it for the first 30-45 minutes then have Duke say ""hang on, this isn't right"" and log onto a nearby Duke Nukem console game and change the settings.  

Next guy he kills gets gore all over the ceiling and there's eyeball juice everywhere, he says, ""uh... I'll go one down from max gore"" &&>blood is important to Duke

What about tits and ass?&&Oh wow. I don't. Please elaborate.&&Tommy Wiseau and Uwe Boll should really be collaborating on stuff together. &&Postal was so good though.&&🎺🎺🎺&&I'd like to see him do Just Cause. That's something right up his alley.&&I really don't like Michael Bay but like...he's probably gonna knock this out of the park. I can't wait.&&He is good for something, as long as that something doesn’t include any story or the use of the concept of “quiet.” &&Pain & Gain was pretty good.

I think he can do a great Duke Nukem movie.&&I still feel power rangers was a big missed opportunity for him. That show is literally built on destruction and explosions.&&[deleted]&&This would honestly be the cleverest way to go. Allows them to have some sharper comedy mixed in with dick jokes, and they can totally keep the over the top, overly macho '80s vibe.&&Or it's an awesome throwback and takes place in the early 90s. Could have a killer soundtrack.&&That's exactly what they did in the game. Characters constantly remind duke he's out of time and a dinosaur. It's a running joke in the game. I don't understand why others call it a rejected pitch.&&His new book is out ""Why I'm so great!""&&Regrettably, Keith David doesn't have the grit for a fight scene anymore.&&They Live had a social message and depth and doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same line as duke unless it is talking about how duke ripped off a line from the movie.&&He just wants that check. I don’t wanna see a damn cgi video game movie in the theaters. I’d watch it on Netflix at best. I want to see John Cena blowin shit up&&The fact that he's making a claim on that character and using a line that was borrowed from another character as a hashtag is ironic&&On the one hand he was Duke Nukem in Duke Nukem 3d

On the other hand he was Duke Nukem in Duke Nukem Forever&&He is a voice actor, it's not *his* character (is it?) 

He just wants money&&YES PLEASE.&&How on earth did you make that connection... And why does it work so well!? &&Very doubtful that he would be. He hated the character and called the writers “ripoff artists” because of how many of his lines they “paid homage” to.&&he hated? duke nukem because it stole lines from the evil dead series.&&I never realized how much I needed Campbell as Duke Nukem until I read this&&If they really stick to the source material, Sam Raimi's gonna need some serious compensation or a writer's credit&&Shaky camera work of a guy shitting himself that takes 15 years to get released?  &&Bubsy.&&So uhh... I rarely ever bring this up but that's me! I did a blind read of the meme on my crappy old mic back in late 2016 and showed it to my discord friends. One of them synced it to the webm and posted it to 4Chan and the rest is history. It got picked up by a YouTuber who went NUTS on it, with a bunch of remixes. Its also been on Pewdiepie, Markiplier, and a bunch of others. 

I didn't have any watermarks or anything and I still have the original audio clip somewhere on my PC. (On mobile) I'll never profit from it but its always heartwarming to see people light up when I do the voice when they don't believe me :) I'm happy so many people like it.

Edit: Oh Gosh, so many responses to wake up to. Brendanielreads tweeted that he didnt make it a while back.

The dude can do bloody shit pretty well lol &&~~That is my exact fear. I think Cena could be perfect, but he cares a lot about his position as a role model, so I can't see him going for what's necessary.~~

&&Michael BAYSPLOSIONSSSS&&I think Michael Bay's due for an ironic 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes with this one. Just like the last Final Destination got a 60% on RT, or Brett Ratner's Hercules got a 61%, or The Expendables 2 got a 65% (as opposed to The Expendables' 42%)

I often tell people that I can't shit on Michael Bay, because we make the video game equivalent of his films.

My views and opinions are my own, and do not reflect those of my employer or anyone else.&&[For those who haven't seen it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asNcneOxjYg)&&i hope they pay They Live for these lines if they use them in the film&&Fucking Dick Kickem&&Fun Duke Nukem 3D trick: binding the fire button to also trigger quick kick meant you were always kicking, and when you select kick as your weapon you'd kick with both legs like some sort of crazed cossack dancer.

No thanks. He should boot up good ol' Duke3D on an old CRT monitor.&&He's not fucking Deadpool.&&Good idea, just needs to be the opening scene of the movie.&&[deleted]&&Postal was quite the shock. Obviously it's completely retarded, but despite being a Uwe Boll movie it was actually mildly entertaining.&&🎺&&He'd push an unnecessary love story and have side characters take up the spotlight instead of our boy Rico.

But there would be explosions...&&I don't know whether Rico's physics-defying wizardry would translate well to live-action.&&Duke's great because he is a very obvious, simple character, there's nothing complex there to get in the way so if you make it action-packed it just works&&Yeah but there’s totally a market for that. I mean Spielberg has these moments too. He’s the king of summer blockbuster. Michael Bay comes from a commercial and music video background so he’s amazing at making things look pretty. His films are beautiful and very technologically sound too. His crew and dp’s are super dedicated and do a great job bringing together something that’s just fun. 

People always hate on him, but I mean The Rock is one of my favorite action movies. Second to Bad Boys 2. They’re both beautifully shot and just plain fun movies, so they aren’t going to get great critic reviews.

No one should be going into a blockbuster like this expecting a riveting story with all these skillfully crafted twists and turns. It’s plain eye candy and he achieves that goal with ease. In my eyes, that makes him successful. Do people really expect transformers to be a work of art? No. But it’s been nominated for oscars in the visual and sound department multiple times for good reason. 

The only difference between Nolan and Michael Bay is that Michael Bay is your party friend who is the life of the party. Christopher Nolan is the guy who gets you in a one on one conversation to make you question your life. &&I liked *Pain & Gain* because it was very aware of itself.

I haven't seen it, but I heard *13 Hours* is actually pretty good. &&PnG was pretty good. I fucking loved the OST to that movie, I still remember listening to it on repeat when doing mindless farming in _Dark Souls 2_.&&Wasn't that Yahtzee's pitch? Not sure if that was the first pitch for DNR or not.&&Not true to his... fukkin what?

That would have been perfect for his character! Just drop Duke Nukem in Demolition Man and let the script write itself!&&I was actually thinking about Duke Nukem the other day, and I kind of realized that as a game, it wouldn't work at all if it came out today. Duke satirized a bunch of 80s cliches and the entire game was an homage to pop culture. 

I don't think half of the gaming population would even understand the references anymore, and would get all pissy and offended about strippers and hookers.

If you made a Duke game today, what's it going to do? Rehash 80s movies? Or would you make it an homage to 90s and 00s movies? Because then I have to ask you 'what action movie catchphrase can you think of that came out of the 90s?' ""I know kung fu?"" And? The muscles-and-guns action movies of yesteryear aren't made anymore. You have to dig deep into B-movie territory for those kinds of movies now, but the old action movies weren't B-movies, they were star-billed high-budget runaway successes.

A 'man out of time' movie is the only way I can see this movie working. &&[deleted]&&He had some decent moments against Russell Crowe in The Nice Guys. &&Yea but let's be real, his voice is like 75% of the character, the other 25% is his design.&&I seriously think it'd be uberironic to get Bruce Campbell to play Duke, because most of his lines were taken from Army of Darkness and Evil Dead 2, to the point I want to see Duke3D dubbed by Bruce Campbell&&Although we can't really blame him for that&&You honestly could make the argument his return was the only redeemable thing about that game. Kinda like how a lot of people said the only thing that would’ve redeemed Berserk 2016 is if they got Marc Diraison back as Guts. &&When he defends Duke Nukem Forever, claiming it's a true classic shooter in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhATc0CY8aE), who's failure was attributed to a market of COD fanboys who don't know a classic shooter, you know he's a paid shill.

In reality, the problem with Duke4 was that it WAS a COD ripoff with Duke Nukem violated into it

Its the new Star Wars formula but John Cena movies.&&I used to masturbate to the strippers in Duke Nukem 3D when I was like 12 and it first came out.
Sorry just thought I would share. &&""You wanna dance?"" &&Tanya from Red Alert?&&Not Sasha Grey. Get some 90s pornstars to make cameos. Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, etc.&&I wish I had the power to make this happen.&&""A strip club scene?"" Disagree - they should have one between each major scene... doesn't have to be long - 30 seconds maybe, but more then once in the move for sure.&&This movie writes itself &&When did Hollywood exec decisions ever make sense?&&It never really catered to the kids in the first place. The originals were rather generic is good platformers for the late DOS era, not particularly targeted at any group other than ""DOS gamers"", while 3D and on were most certainly adult-oriented. 

&&Pain and Gain was high art and an incredibly self aware social commentary. I didn't think Michael Bay had it in him. It is probably my favorite film of his next to The Rock.&&Probably my favorite Dwayne Johnson role. It was extremely unique and fit him so well. &&Lmao, the new movie has a scene where he accidentally puts his daughter's panties in his mouth ffs&&*I'll rip your head off and shit down your neeeeeck*&&Eat shit and die!&&Bizzaro he's doing it again&&That's a fucking 50 dkp MINUS&&Level 18.

Michael Bay should just direct it himself and pour all his creative energies and every technique he's created into that one movie. &&Holy fuck, this is exactly what I would picture the critic's consensus to be. Well done!&&That describes far too many movies. &&I’d accept anything if it was taken in a creative way, even if it’s a creative in not trying to be good. Taking chances is my only real expectation of a movie&&Critics aren't necessarily movie snobs. I think a lot of them try to take the approach that Ebert made popular which is to judge a movie based on how well it pulls off what it's trying to be.&&dude, how fucking scared are you people of legal action if you have to put a disclaimer in your *throwaway account* comment?&&They feel more like an action novel than a Bay movie. I don't think anyone has gotten close to Bay's style in video games yet.&&That is some infectious laughter right there!&&I straight up can’t watch this video. I was stuck in a laughing fit for a solid half a fucking hour. Every time I tried to think about it less, that shit just flooded back into my mind, fresh and new and as equally hilarious as the first time I watched it. 

There’s just something about this video that triggers my humor on a level that nothing else does. &&https://i.imgur.com/St1ajwg.png&&Holy shit I forgot about this.  Just woke up my girlfriend laughing so hard.&&Do you think John Carpenter is really hurting for money that bad? &&About 20 years too late with this tip.

Bad Boys II is a horrible movie, but holy hell is it watchable. &&If they really want to keep it authentic the in game devoloper console should show up and show the input of the commands just as if you were playing it yourself.

Everyone around him has some sort of complicated agenda and all he cares about is making things explode.&&Watch him fuck it up with a prolonged love story.&&I mean, I'd have said the same thing about Transformers to be honest. And that...did not work out.&&The Rock is the best action movie of the 90s IMO. Bay doesn't have a great reputation (largely his own fault) but he has made some fantastic popcorn flicks.&&I actually quite liked 13 Hours to be honest. Can't speak to the realism, but it was quite tense and a good movie that didn't have the over-the-top ridiculous set peices some of his other films do. &&Overall I liked 13 hours, minus the cheesy dialogue and poor attempts at humor. But that gun fight was pretty sweet.&&I can't even imagine Duke's voice without that scratchy shitty hyper-compressed 90s video game sound.&&Dub in St. Jon over Cena.

I'm a little freaked out.&&Would have been better than the sequel was&&That would have been awesome.  I have alway wanted to see a comedy action movie with a martial arts action star and all the Kung fu involved was based on Michael Jackson’s dance moves. &&They also made an entire movie from cut footage called, ""Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie"". &&I thought this was r/news at first...&&This could easily be the plot of the third film with some additional twists and ridiculous outcomes.

Ron could somehow combine his newly profound martial arts skills in addition to being blind.&&Of course it did.&&Quantitative proof that massive amounts of drugs are involved in the writings of these first drafts.&&I'd watch it.&&so an entirely different movie?&&I’ve actually seen the footage! I think maybe it was a dvd extra, or a directors cut? It was terrible. Anchorman is one of the funniest movies and I don’t think I laughed once during the “original version”. Christina Applegate wasn’t in it, I don’t think. I remember thinking that they probably showed this version to a test audience and it didn’t get a single laugh so they re wrote it. It was so different than the final movie. &&... Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight &&Absolutely should have gone with that &&It should end with one of those monkeys riding past a partially buried statue of liberty.

EDIT(since a subcomment has more upvotes) That was the joke. I've seen the sequel and Wake Up.&&Wait, trilogy? There's another anchorman movie?&&I never knew i wanted to see a final battle scene as badly as i want to see this one. Superman vs. darkseid, professor x vs. Magneto, smokey vs. the bandit. Nothing, i mean nothing beats news anchors vs. monkeys.&&As the first movie was in the 1970s, the next movie was in the 1980s, I think it would be cool if the third one was in the 1990s and Ron was covering the OJ trial.&&How would a third movie go?  I assume it would be set in the 90's.  Was 90's news different enough from 80's news?  I guess I could see them going more political with Burgundy accidentally becoming a Bill O'Reilly like figure.&&Well, they do have Wake Up Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie, which was made from a footage trimmed from the first movie, and includes Kevin Corrigan, Chuck D, Maya Rudolph, Amy Poehler, Seth Rogan, and possibly others...&&Yes, twice.&&A prequel! &&Still haven't seen the second.

So did half my friends. Prior to this movie, I would've said there's no way a bunch of people could flat out fall asleep in a movie theater with how loud theater sound systems are, but this movie was boring enough that it put about half a dozen 18/19/20 year old guys and girls to sleep.

I'm always surprised that people still remember and talk about it. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can be a bit stuck up when it comes to comedies, but the fact that my friends fell asleep, too, was enough to know it wasn't just me this time.&&So random&&>9 year old boy would come up with.

Apparently jokes and obvious setups need to be explained for any amount of enjoyment.&&Oh no bro&&When they made the original Anchorman, they shot a LOT of extra footage. There were entire other plots that were filmed and screened for audiences.

After the movie came out, they cut a bunch of the extra stuff into a whole other movie that they released on DVD called ""Wake Up, Ron Burgundy!"". Usually when you see Anchorman on DVD/Blu-ray these days, it comes packaged with that too.

It's basically an entirely different movie, IIRC it re-uses almost no footage from the original movie, but part of that is because it relies on you having already seen Anchorman. It's pretty much like a whole other story going on during the time of the original movie but also kind of feels like a sequel the way they edited it.&&It's kind of a movie. Wake up Ron burgundy was a bonus disc with the Original DVD release which was basically a movie made completely of abandoned plot, stuff that was cut and alternate/extended cuts of scenes that ended up in the movie. The plot doesn't flow really well but it has some very funny scenes. Most of the scenes were improvised (outside of a loose script) so there was tons of extra material, this was a really cool way to utilize it!&&[*Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229340/). I mean, it's good for a Frat Pack comedy sequel, which means that it's an okay (but fairly forgettable) comedy in general. Fight scene's hilarious, though.&&...holy shit.

I think it's called Wake Up Ron Burgundy. &&Orangutans aren’t monkeys though, so the original script would’ve had to have star-throwing apes&&Orangutans aren’t monkeys.&&- Michael Scott&&You wouldn’t say that if you read the script for it. I promise you it makes no sense. I wish I could take back the time I spent reading it, but instead, here I am with it locked into my memory, forever wondering what the point was. 

The changes they made were a godsend for the movie, imo. But maybe that’s just me. &&Speak for yourself.&&I agree. But when I do, I'm glad there are movies like Anchorman to watch. &&This is very true. I've enjoyed far, far worse, as well.&&I have 65 cents and some pocket lent. &&They did make it! It was called Wake up, Ron Burgundy IIRC&&Sonofabitch. &&Thanks it's next on my list now!&&Will Ferrell truly outdoes himself in that clip of the crash. So upset this didn't get made. &&Yessssssss &&I can’t tell what’s real anymore.&&No touching of the hair or face!&&If you haven't seen the R-rated version I recommend watching it, it's a lot funnier than the theatrical cut&&I thought it was liked? I liked it&&Let's just call this new idea 'Anchorman 2' and forget the sequel ever existed.&&I had weird feelings about the movie. While I was watching it, I felt like it I didn't like it as much..but there are silly parts to that movie that maybe I found funnier upon reflection than on first viewing.  

Things like them spending damn near 10 minutes on the ""I'm blind"" gag, moving Ron into an old house by the sea.

Harrison Ford transforms into a werewolf.

Brick's bizarre lovelife

It seems to make me laugh thinking back on it now than it did while I was watching it.&&The same thing, but in SPACCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&&Literally anywhere. You can't possibly jump the shark after a movie like this

Edit: Maybe the only way is if they team up with the ninjastar-throwing monkeys, that's too much&&What I liked about it was that it was the most insane part of what was overall a zany workplace comedy. Like the entire movie’s off the wall, but it’s relatively grounded in comparison with the trident throwing.&&And the gang fight in the second one took all of the appeal and charm the first movie had and ran it into the ground.&&To be fair the Ron being blind stuff was probably the best part of the second film&&Yeah I remember seeing the big fight in Anchorman 2 and thinking ""this is bullshit, they're trying too hard"". Long strings of cameos are obnoxious. I lasted 15 or so minutes into Zoolander 2 for this reason, then noped out. Fucking Skrillex?!!!&&That's true, it does have a few amazing lines.&&Or maybe the guy who wrote Planet of the Apes was.&&Yes! Or maybe something Aquaman related, because of the Trident. &&Blue Ruin is my favorite crowdfunded movie ever.

I have a lot of hope for Super Troopers 2 though.

&&When does that come out?&&I read this and was like super troopers didn't end with Martial Arts monkeys &&You'd do it for Randolph Scott.&&They wrapped months ago, where the hell is the trailer or movie already?&&Potentially working. For all we know it could be a complete bust. 

Not trying to be negative and I think those guys could make me laugh with cardboard props on someone’s garage but we don’t ‘know’ that they’re crowd sourcing campaign successfully translated into the film. For all we know it could be a very frustrating and difficult time for them. Again, not trying to focus on the negatives but we do not know for sure. &&By the beard of Zeus I must see this!! Where can it be found? &&To my knowledge, they didn't do that. And that is just silly, why would anyone do that.

They just had 5 or 6 things going on in the movie and they did a lot of improv. When the movie was done it was 6 hours long. The easiest way to edit a movie down is to pick one minor storyline and edit every single part of it out.  In this case they picked 4 storylines, edited them all out. When they were done, after the movie was succesfull, they decided to do a reedit for the dvd release where they used the 4 cut storylines as the bulk of the movie.&&That was the joke, homie &&Nice TIL&&With Anchorman 2 they had 60 hours of footage. After it went through theaters, they did a re-edit where they just replaced every joke with another (usually improvised) line. &&I always wondered what that was.&&CHAMP

BURGUNDY&&Time stamp?&&They clearly cut him out of the scene because he can't handle it. &&God he's such a phenomenal comedic actor. I have to remind myself this is Michael Scott. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuU3ZnD1Uo&&I love you &&I thought it was funny. I had to pause it. &&That's just how amazing he is.&&Let’s just hope he doesn’t attract bears.&&[deleted]&&LOUD NOISES!&&LOUD NOISES!!!&&* Wayne Gretzky&&It's like the opposite of the Hangover Trilogy.&&Indeedidly so&&I appreciate you giving that up&&I’m thinking about giving up spare change and candy wrappers for pocket lent&&Solid start.&&[Pocket sand!

&&does it change the entire movie from unfunny to funny? like with Bad Santa?

Doesn't take away from the first one for me, though.&&I was onboard with the second one till about the half way mark, then it went tits up.
&&Admittedly, the Ghost of Stonewall Jackson was pretty great.&&I hate when sequels do this. ""Hey remember this organic scene or line from the first film that turned out to be incredibly memorable? Well here it is again, twice as long, shown in 3 different parts of the movie, and all of the actors are really obvious about it.""&&Vince Vaughn was also a legit badass in his one scene.&&I thought it dragged the film to a halt basically. &&Now I know what the villagers of Pompeii felt like! &&I actually think it's the worst part of it. It's the reason I totally checked out of the movie.&&Oh god Zoolander 2 was trash &&Nothing can beat the first movie, but the fight in part 2 was great, it had to be over the top.&&Will Ferrell invented and then killed the career comedy sub-genre. Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, all great movies with some really quotable parts. Then he made Semi-Pro and that was it, it killed the sub-genre. I will admit though, once I finally saw it it wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but it was definitely forgettable.&&Or the guy who wrote the end of spaceballs...&&That was Pierre Boulle and Rod fucking Serling&&[deleted]&&Blue Ruin is one of my favorite movies and it was shot pretty close to where I went to school.&&For me its Kung fury

Its fuckin hilarious and the cgi is top notch &&That movie was crowd funded!, I had no idea. It's amazing that people choose to fund such a indie movie.&&Did you not see Anchorman 2?&&I'm partial to Kung Fury&&Blue Ruin is quite honestly the best movie I have seen from the past decade, and I did not know it was crowdfunded until I saw this post&&I just watched that movie a couple nights ago. I loved Green Room and thought Blue Ruin was excellent! I'm really looking forward to Hold The Dark. &&I wanna say 4/20. &&[removed]&&It's included with the Blu Ray.&&There's an Anchorman with 4 extra storylines? I need to rewatch this movie.&&No prob. I think a bunch of the stuff that ended up in Wake Up, Ron Burgundy! was originally included as different deleted scenes on the DVD but the movie itself is cut together to be a coherent story. But I don't think it really introduces the characters much or anything because you already know them from the movie proper, and I think Veronica is already there at the start of the movie.&&[Here is a link to the exact moment](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LEC_lkpD3rM) &&You can see his face stretch out so hard while he's trying his dammed best not to lose it&&I was sat here wondering why I never saw the actor who played Brick in anything else even though he’s so fucking funny.

Holy shit how did I not know about this.&&This is...incorrect. It has a few moments but is mostly terrible. &&Yes but where can I find it!?&&Well that guy considers it bad. Opinions, everybody has them&&Because taste is subjective and everyone's different. I loved it, laughed my ass off throughout. The people who hate it aren't *wrong*, they're just different people with different sensibilities. Simple as that.&&It felt like it was trying to recreate the first Anchorman, imo.&&because it didnt live up to the legendary expectations of the first,
 had it been a stand alone it probably would have been considered a fun dumb comedy&&>because Bad Santa is an awful film when it's played on cable. uncut, it is one of the funniest movies made in the past couple decades

Which one?&&Do you want me to make you some sammwiches?&&Past couple decades? &&Yeah but the gang fight in the third one really brought the series back to a new high!&&Never saw the first, so 2 was great to me.&&It would've been funny if they made it look like a recreation, but turned into something else.&&Yea to be brutal it felt like they had a good idea for the film (a revolutionary way to present news) but had no way to develop the story so they just threw in a curveball conflict(Ron's condition). The first film explored the story idea all the way to the end.&&AKA 'True Detective' Vince Vaugh&&I think the whole Ron living in a lighthouse bit went on for too long but the blind jokes were hilarious. ""I drank half a bottle of ketchup thinking it was Chateauneuf du Pape"" &&Oh yeah I forgot there was something I was supposed to be doing. Also did ya'll know about Space Balls: The Animated Series? It came out in 2008 and seems pretty horrible so far but I'm gonna try to finish the first episode.&&There goes the planet...&&I really wanted Bullets of Justice to succeed.&&Yeah well Lady Bird is pretty much about my hometown. Check mate...atheists..? &&There’s a scene in Borat that was shot in my hometown right across from a restaurant I was at almost everyday. It’s the scene where he almost gets hit on his moped. &&The movie post apocalyptic movie “The Road” had one or two scenes filmed it Conneaut Lake Park Pennsylvania, which is like .25 miles from where I lived at the time and what I would consider my home town.&&It's treason then&&Apparently the dudes that made it just did it to showcase how good they were are CGI. And uh... then it turned into Kung Fury. God I fucking love that thing.&&Wow I had no idea, that was my favourite film of 2013!  


Apparently it was two friends who’d been making films since childhood together doing their last hoorah in filmmaking.  So glad to see it instead launched their careers.  &&[deleted]&&If not, don't.&&Oh shit that's the weed day!!&&They also got a bit crazier with some of those scenes/plotlines, like when they're riding in the van and Brick points directly at the camera and says ""Look, a Camera!"".  &&I don't understand how they cut that!&&I’m never prepared for the inevitable &&[why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYmOqPFyJPw)&&I love you right now man&&I truly hate you. &&Well played.&&Very funny, but [here's](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/212/manning.png) a freeze-frame of Rudd cracking up.&&You son of a bitch&&Wow legend&&Godfuckingdamnit&&God dammit why am I not surprised &&Is this a joke?

(Didn't know that was a thing  for movies), or go plundering and find it at the bottom of a treasure chest with a parrot on your shoulder. 

If that last one isn't obvious enough, then type ""wake up Ron Burgundy"" into your search engine of choice, possibly with ""watch online"" or ""stream"", turn on adblock, make sure your virus scanner is set to overdrive and find it that way. &&I think when you have a film as culturally significant as Anchorman, doing literally *anything* new with those characters is a serious challenge. The original film became a feature-length meme, and you can't live up to that with a sequel. People automatically reject it simply because it isn't the film they know back to front. And then they get mad and say ""no, it was objectively terrible"", and honestly I think if they calmed their tits and went back and rewatched Anchorman 2 they'd realise it's damn near as good as the first.

I know people who thought Pick Of Destiny was shit when it came out because it didn't end on Tribute. ""They spent the whole film setting it up and didn't play it!"" That about sums up my view on how people engage with these sorts of films. &&Bad Santa&&""No I don't want any sandwiches, what is it with you and making fuckin sandwiches"" &&Hello, Future Person.&&They say it's a bad idea to make a sequel. That you're not gonna catch lightning in a bottle a second time. Thought I'd be okay because it was my first time trying both times. That's when the fucking lightning catches you in the asshole. Caspere knew this.&&Wouldn't you know it was ketchup the second you tasted it?

And when I still was in Richmond, my buddy was an extra in Lincoln because he has a dope beard.&&Oh ya....? I live by Detroit... (,Gasp) 😱😱😰🤧😋&&Good old Pennsyltucky.&&Well they filmed 'girl interrupted' in Lancaster, PA where I grew up.  The Road was badass tho&&the humor is a lot more surreal and I really enjoyed that about it. like how Champ is now the owner of a fried chicken restaurant and to save money, he doesn’t use chicken. rather he sells fried bats that he buys from “them” who call it “chicken of the cave”. the movie is just bizarre as hell and I loved it for that

edit: also the fight in the sequel is way better imo. all the cable news channels were great, but I died laughing when The History Channel shows up with a minotaur, Liam Neeson, and the ghost of Stonewall Jackson (played by John C Reilly)&&For me, disappointing as fuck. Not a terrible movie, but a lot changes in a decade. Bad mix of trying to 'one up' the first one, match its humor, while trying to adapt it for a more modern audience. Just what I think. Some funny stuff, but for me, ultimately forgettable.&&A lot of people are saying it's not that bad,  but to me it is. All the humor is super forced. It's way too long. The jokes are dumb for the sake of being dumb but not in a very funny way. I think they all knew how unnecessary it all was.&&It's not *that* bad.

I guess it was technically a climax.. but it’s literally Ron trying to get across town to see his son’s piano recital. the movie was so dumb that I felt satisfied, it didn’t try to do anything else or disguise its intentions. the director’s cut of the sequel was way better than the theatrical version imo&&Honestly I think it's pretty funny.

Leonardo DiCaprio To Star In Quentin Tarantino’s Manson Movie,62423,7pz256,http://deadline.com/2018/01/leonardo-dicaprio-quentin-tarantino-manson-movie-casting-1202241971/,2267,1515785763.0,,"*DiCaprio’s will play an aging actor in the story that is being kept under wraps but is a Pulp Fiction-esque movie set in the 1969 Los Angeles during the summer of the Manson murders.*

*Tarantino has already asked Margot Robbie to play the role of Sharon Tate, and as Deadline has reported Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt have been circling the project with DiCaprio for what is known to be two meaty male roles.*

This has good things written all over it.&&Leo’s never actually going to star in Devil in the White City, is he? He keeps signing up for other projects and that movie seems stuck in development hell.&&***WALTON GOGGINS OR IT'S A BUST***&&It’s crazy that this is his first major film appearance since The Revenant, which was almost three years ago. He’s at the height of his career. Most actors in his position would be trying to churn out as many movies as they can, yet DiCaprio seems very selective. I can definitely respect that.&&> Tarantino has already asked Margot Robbie to play the role of Sharon Tate


Oh my God, if we got a Wolf of Wall Street reunion *and* a Django Unchained reunion in the same film I will be unable to contain myself&&I wish Heath Ledger was still around.  I'll bet he'd kill it at playing Manson&&That's a bingo!&&You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.&&> The release date coincides with the 50th anniversary of Tate’s murder at the hands of the Manson family.

Didn't realize this........ Fun stuff...&&I really hope Shia LaBeouf gets cast as Manson. &&The article says Pitt and Tom Cruise are circling the project as well... Would love for Cruise to play Manson but I don't know if he's actually in the movie. This sounds more like a Zodiac type movie - not ever showing killer's perspective.&&Now I want so badly for Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt to sign on. Robbie's performance in I, Tonya was my favorite of the year and seeing a Pitt-Tarantino reunion would be nothing short of fantastic. 

Between the [rumored] cast and Tarantino's return to modern-day films (relative to Django, Hateful Eight, and Inglorious Basterds' setting), I can't wait for this film to come out. &&I've just consciously realized how many high-profile directors DiCaprio has gotten the privilege to work with over the last 20 years: James Cameron, Danny Boyle, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Edward Zwick, Ridley Scott, Sam Mendes, Christopher Nolan, Clint Eastwood, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and now he's working with Quentin Tarantino once again. It's quite impressive how he has managed to rise up to the position he's currently at in such a relatively short amount of time.&&I'd like to see Jim Carrey as Manson, he looks the part lately and he's actually decent in serious roles. &&Thank God he's not playing Manson and that this is a Pulp Fiction-type scenario around the time of the Tate house murders. For a while I was afraid this was gonna be a Charlie glorification flick.&&Get Sam Rockwell for the Manson role.&&Leo + QT = oh FUCK yeah&&Ok if you dont think Tom Cruise could play a crazy hippie cult leader, watch Born on the 4th of July and Interview with the Vampire&&How about this idea:

Leo as Aging TV actor

Brad Pitt as his 10 yrs older vet Stuntman/Buddy

Tom Cruise as Manson

Margot as Sharon Tate&&I like to imagine DiCaprio as the aging actor with Cruise and Pitt playing buddy-cop, ragged detectives. Just the thought of Pulp Fiction meets Nice Guys meets LA Confidential with those three guys sounds amazing. &&So now they need to cast Leos stuntman/buddy. Could be Brad Pitt. dont think itd be tom cruise &&Ok, I'm excited. Like really fucking excited. &&If they get Cruise as well this will easily become my most anticipated film in the works. &&I'm really torn on this movie.

I recently listened to the podcast, *You Must Remember This*, which had a several-part series all about his life and the events of the murders.

You really learn that Manson did all of this because he wanted fame. He wanted to be known just to be known.

So while this event was a big part of the 60s, I hate that Manson is finally getting what he always wanted. And he got it because he murdered innocent people.

Yes, I know he's dead. But...it still feels wrong.&&I wonder who he’s going to play?&&This man is one of the few remaining, untainted by comic book nonsense, Hollywood actors in the world still capable of helping produce evocative, thoughtful “blockbusters”.  He rarely makes bad movies anymore and when he’s in something new I think a lot of people - both young and old - can agree it’s worth a trip to the theatres to see.  &&Leo coming back with multiple bangs.&&I don’t know. Perhaps it’s time to replace DiCaprio again

https://media.giphy.com/media/PrAMyghZaYjm/giphy.gif

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrqaPThCmI&&Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie, Cruise and Jackson (?) are so many A-lister. It's fantastic but not very Tarantino like. I hope we will also see some typical Tarantino-actors like Madsen, Goggins, Roth or finally Harvey Keitel again!&&I'd love Cruise to star in this. He'd fit in well. &&Where is Leo’s Devil in the White City!?!?&&Didn't I read awhile ago that Tarantino was going to make a Star Trek film? &&Why are so many people assuming Charles Manson even makes an appearance in this movie as a character? Nothing in the plot descriptions I’ve seen suggest there is a Manson character.&&Walton Goggins pls&&manson film+tarantino??? wonder how many times the word N***** will be used lmao&&[deleted]&&> meaty male roles

[ooh!](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/0b74b0dd-6031-47d4-8d33-4c9dcd75188f)&&Tom Cruise in a Tarantino flick? That’s... interesting.&&The one bad thing so far is that they’re releasing it on the anniversary of Tate’s murder. How tasteless.&&I really hope that movie happens. Probably the most exciting movie project in development (that I've heard of). &&I'm pretty sure it's happening after The Irishman.&&This is one of my favorite books, I've been waiting for the movie for so long.&&I mean, I don't know if this is the conclusion you can draw here. Scorsese is busy with The Irishman. He's not doing Devil in the White City right now. Why would DiCaprio not sign up for other projects in the mean time?&&He bought the movie rights to it, so it can be on the back burner for as long as he likes, he's the only one who can make it. I'm sure itll happen soon enough
&&Better this way, than going at it with some substandard director and screenwriter. Even in the case that it would never happen (I imagine the rights would move to someone else at some point though) it's still better than getting a shitty version of it. &&I thought he already did? Isnt that the one about Holmes murder house?&&The script is the issue there, has nothing to do with DiCaprio. Scorsese hasn’t liked any of the scripts that various writers have done for the movie (there is at least one that is easy to find online), so he isn’t doing anything with it until he has a solid script. &&Came here to say exactly this! WTF!?!? I was so looking forward to seeing H.H. Holmes being portrayed by Leo.  Seeing what Scorsese would do with it.&&Wally Goggins please!&&***WALTON GOGGINS AND I'LL BUST***&&Nothing would make me more happy than Boyd Crowder as Charlie Manson.&&[deleted]&&Cock a doodle do!&&Give me Joaquin Phoenix, damnit!&&
I just loved him in Sons of Anarchy.

Yah, he would make a great Manson. 

&&Walton Goggins as Roman Polanski please!&&Oh, I'ma go walkin' in the moonlight with you!&&Loved him in Vice Principals, fucking hilarious. On a totally unrelated note, this guy would definitely make the best Joker.&&> He’s at the height of his career.

Yeah but he's been on an ever growing *height of his career* ever since Romeo + Juliet in 1996&&The Revenant was 3 years ago...
What.  &&The guy was pushing out so many good performances try to get that Oscar for several years in a row. He burned out I think. &&He's using the height of his career and popularity for what he wants most and how he can most influential... dealing with the environmental crisis&&I disagree with one thing from your comment, DiCaprio has been able to be selective specifically because of his position, and most actors would do the same if given the chance.

He knows he doesn't have to pick a role to he doesn't like to pay the bills or stay relevant, same as Daniel Day-Lewis, he was on hiatus from Lincoln (2012) till Phantom Thread (2018)&&dudes got talent and he knows it.&&Quality over Quantity. I mean, look at Daniel Day Lewis. He is arguably the greatest actor of our time and the guy only does one movie every 5 years or so it seems &&He's just building up until he can do a complete de Niro and start doing family comedies.&&Well he got pregnant and they couldn't write it into the script. &&height of his career has been going on for like 20 years man lol&&Revenant is barely 2 years old.

&&can't wait to see the 20 minute videos on youtube that will analyze all of this&&Must buy fake blood and fake cocaine stock ASAP.&&You do know that Samuel L Jackson being in it is going to make it a Literally Every Tarantino Movie Reunion as well, right?&&Jonah Hill was in both movies too. I wouldn't mind him popping up in this. He hasn't been in anything good since 22 Jump Street.&&This casting is out of this world. Wonder what Polanski's going to say about it.&&I think I'm one of like seven people who didn't like Wolf of Wallstreet.&&That sounds amazing... fuck&&I'd be fine with Jake Gyllenhaal as Manson. We know he can play psycho like in Nightcrawler and he can do the whole crazy eyes thing. Add the long hair and call it good.

https://i.imgur.com/kmQ6OBl.jpg&&Attendez la crème!&&[deleted]&&You just say bingo&&https://media.giphy.com/media/RZhmtLIdsCKfS/giphy.gif&&Man deserved best supporting actor for that one. Such an absolute asshole character.&&...exploitative...&&First time I’ve seen somebody mention this. Yes please. &&Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf....&&Do it!&&God there's so many ways they can take Manson in this movie...

He most likely won't be in it much but every scene is gonna be a beast. &&Emile Hirsch would be great as well. He literally looks just like Manson &&And you can see there's blood on his face!  
My god, there's blood everywhere!&&> Would love for Cruise to play Manson 

Do you think he'd be able to play the crazy leader of a mad cult?&&Hopefully it’s kinda like Zodiac and Pulp Fiction combined&&/u/Dudebroman_5000 here in the comments proposed Shia LaBeouf as Manson. 

I'm with him. &&Bob Odenkirk has the best Manson.&&Charles Manson was 36 in 1970.  He looks ridiculous for 55, but he doesn't look twenty years younger so I hope not.  Besides, if they were going to have Manson in it, I'd rather a relative unknown so I don't see the actor, I see the character.&&> Would love for Cruise to play Manson

He's got the dead eyes for it. ^I ^am ^a ^Tom ^Cruise ^fan


&&Someone tweeted that Pitt has moved on due to scheduling so the role is Cruise's if he wants it.&&What if Tom Cruise plays Polanski.&&Tom Cruise would, for this one time, actually play a character that is smaller than him in real life. 

Okay, size jokes aside, it would be fucking awesome to see Cruise play Manson. I mean, really. &&Margot Robbie's performance was my favorite and she needs to win her first Academy Award. It felt like a Scorsese movie and Tonya Harding was a Scorsese anti hero. It was great. I hope Brad Pitt and Margot say yes. &&It's so weird how much I want to see that movie despite not being around during the controversy and not liking skating. I watched the Documentary that was on last night and I thought it was really interesting.
&&I always kind of liked Margot Robbie as an actress, but after watching I, Tonya she rocketed into Oscar worthy status for me. She was amazing.&&More like directors have had the privilege to work with DiCaprio.&&Pretty sure he's said he chooses movies to work in based off the director. &&I would thoroughly enjoy seeing Leo work with:

- Denis Villeneuve (Bladerunner 2049, Enemy, Prisoners)
- Coen Brothers (No Country for Old Men, Fargo)
- David Fincher (Fight Club, Gone Girl, The Social Network)
- PTA (Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood)
- James Gray (We Own The Night, The Immigrant)
- Terence Malick (Tree of Life)
- Spike Jonze (Her)
- Alex Garland (Ex Machina)
- Andrew Domink (The Drop, The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford)&&Jumanji style Robin Williams playing an old manson sitting in his cell narrating his younger life as a cult leader would have been fantastic.&&Decent?? He's a phenomenal serious actor. He did an amazing job in some of the best cult classic movies such as Eternal Sunshade of the Spotless Mind, The Truman Show and, Man on the Moon.

Often it's comedy actors that do some of the best serious roles. Even look at Will Ferrell and Robin Williams.&&Plus he's perfect for batshit crazy roles&&So many people are going to be thrown off by the movie not focusing on Manson family. I get why the headlines are like that, but damn. I'm sure that even when this film has been out for a while, people are still making threads like ""I thought the focus was going to be Manson family and the murders, damn was I surprised"". &&Nah I trust Tarantino. He fucks up sometimes but his intentions are always right and it's always art in one form or another which is rare these days in film.&&Ohhhh that’s interesting.&&Genius&&I don't think there is a better choice. I think he could pull off the look and feel.&&I was actually going to comment this. He’d be so perfect for it. Could be a career defining role. &&Oh fuck yes.&&I mean Tom Cruise basically is a crazy cult leader&&My first thought was Magnolia.&&feel like tom cruise would kill it as manson since he already has experience in leading a cult&&I personally think Cruise would be better as the stuntman. He doesn't really resemble Manson and it fits seeing as he already notoriously handles his own stunts. Then put Goggins as Manson. Whatever the role is, the thought of Tom Cruise being in a QT movie alongside Leo is insanely exciting&&Walton Goggins as Manson would be better; he would be perfect for the role&&Yeah but the movie isn't about Manson anyway, those headlines are there for the clicks

From what I heard he's going to get the same treatment hitler did in Inglorious bastards

Also I don't think this movie means that he got what he wanted. People already know about Manson, he was already a part of our history. It's not like no one has ever heard of him until this movie&&I get what you're saying but he's been pretty ingrained in pop culture since the trial. This same argument was around when Guns 'n' Roses covered his music in the 90's

It's not like one more project featuring him is going to make or break his infamy. Seems more like a drop in the bucket at this point. &&That Manson Murders series one the best podcast series I’ve ever heard. That said, I’ve been wracking my brain trying to figure out who Leo could be playing if he’s going to be playing an “aging actor.” No clue.&&Article says he’s gonna be the aging TV actor in LA.&&Yeah he thought of some kinda crazy R rated Star Trek idea. I think he ran it by J.J. Abrams and he liked it. I believe he and a few different writers are working on it now as well&&>I wonder what they mean by Pulp Fiction-esque

Margot Robbie's going to have a foot fetish scene. And someone will say the N word.&&I’m assuming different segments following different people that are slightly connected &&Yeah, might as well say it's going to be very ""Tarantino-ish.""&&I knew this would be here somewhere! &&Makes sense to me. Cruise can be a very versatile and intense actor when he needs to be. All insanity aside, his performances are great.&&Gotta say really excites me. He can knock it out of the park in some movies.&&Except for that in Tarantino fashion, similarly to Basterds, Sharon will probably murder them all. &&I, Tonya released on the same day as the original attack on Nancy Carrigan as well&&Tasteless is putting it mildly.

&&Especially with Scorsese behind it. &&I'm pretty excited about [Tarantino's Star Trek](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-screenwriter/amp)&&Can you hype me for it too I have no clue what it is&&Everything will be happening after The Irishman...&&The Lost City of Z really restores my hype for this. That was one of my favorite books and it too was stuck in development hell, until it just sorta happened. And while it may have came and gone for most people, it turned out *really* good, so I’m hoping the same happens with this. Brad Pitt needs to get behind it&&i read this book the month i moved to chicago and it was fucking incredible. absolutely devoured it. &&Signing up for projects in the meantime makes sense, but right now he’s signed onto at least 4 projects other than Devil in the White City (this, the Leonardo Da Vinci biopic, the Teddy Roosevelt biopic, and the Ulysses S. Grant biopic, which is a lot to sign up for if he is still planning to star in Devil in the White City.&&> about Holmes murder house?

Yeah. But the movie hasn't been made yet.&&It's that, crossed with the Chicago World's Fair. And you'd have to fuck with the actual history to get a decent ~~book~~ movie out of it, because the stories never really cross, and the fair one just kind of peters out. 

EDIT: Wrote book instead of movie. It's a great book, go read it, but it's a history, not a novel where the stories wrap up satisfyingly. &&I was so excited to put Walton Goggins down because no one else would think of...dammit!&&MY MAN!&&...this is the correct answer.&&Oh, I just meant in general for any role. Anyone who steals an entire film out from Sam Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, etc should be given a slot in Tarantino's final two movies. :)&&He was shockingly good in Rover. Good enough that I would believe he might make a decent Manson.&&Pattinson is a shockingly great actor. Not like he was 'bad' in twilight, but he was just really bland throughout the entire movie. But in every other role I've seen him in he has been brilliant. &&And even before that was What’s Eating Gilbert Grape Grape, which was amazing and he was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. It’s a totally different type of performance from him that shows how talented he is. &&True. I'm not a big movie person at all, but I always look forward to the next Dicaprio movie. I know this is way later than R+J in 1996, but Inception and Shutter Island got me to really notice him. Then Django got me to follow him, and Wolf of Wall Street made him my favorite actor by far (if he wasn't already). The Revenant I went to the theater to see just because he was in it. Excited to keep climbing Dicaprio mountain 


Edit: I promise to watch The Departed, guys! Thanks for the recommendation :)&&Damn that was a good fuckin movie&&God I fucking love Baz Luhrmann. Romeo + Juliet. Moulin Rouge. The Great Gatsby. The Get Down. I just love his style. I wish he did more.&&Can’t ever hear ‘Young hearts, run free’ without seeing Mercutio dancing at the top of the staircase in drag. &&Did no one else watch what’s eating Gilbert grape? Easily one of the best DiCaprio performances and should have netted him an Oscar.&&True but he is such a fucking great actor!&&Came out December 25th, 2015 so it's actually 2 years.&&It came out Dec 25, 2015.  
So barely 2 years ago. &&I don't think he burned out. I just think he is hyper selective. He really doesn't make bad movies nor do I see him wanting too.

1. Most of Hollywood is focused on churn and burn cash cows. 2 part movies. Re makes. Stupid shit like that. 

2. High profile directors just don't make as many moves as they are focused on quality projects that take more time. If you look at how many movies the top directors have made in the last 10 years compared to all the crap I think you will see.

He is not burned out. Just unwilling to star in any sub par project 

&&DiCaprio is famous for never starring in a sequel. He only does one off movies, or is only in one of them. 

Today, every movie is part of a franchise. So if he's still sticking hard to that rule then his options are pretty limited.&&And hanging out with supermodels on sail boats. &&Didn't they both say they were retiring from acting? Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but the gap doesn't surprise me if they had said they were done. &&I think a lot of people don’t understand that many actors, even those who’ve been in big lead roles, need to pay the bills with shitty sequels. 

I don’t look down on them for that. &&time well spent! just like all the Snoke videos!&&20 minutes? what is this, amateur hour? the movie is likely going to be 2+ hours long, you could probably do a cursory analysis and end up with 5+ hours of footage.&&TEASER TRAILER BREAKDOWN AND 26 DETAILS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED! <video thumbnail with giant red arrow pointing to DiCaprio’s slightly disheveled hair.>&&Qualuudes too BUY BUY BUY!&&Hah! You actually think that's fake cocaine...&&He was in Django???&&Have you seen War Dogs?&&He should come back to America just to tell everyone how he feels.&&Too old probably!&&""Man, I wish I hadn't raped that underage girl so I could still work in Hollywood.""&&Really? I thought it was in the top 5 best comedies of past 10 years.&&Just a typical Scorcese film. 

Dude from quiet, humble beginnings gets caught up in a shady industry. He's taken under someone's wing and eventually grows to become immensely successful. Let's the success and fortune gets to his head, does some crazy, edgy shit along the way, and eventually it all comes crashing down as the law catches up to him. Then it ends with him returning back to a life of mediocrity. &&I really liked first few minutes of it, I wanted to watch something like Boiler Room where an aggressive money hungry kid climbs to the top of a questionable stock empire. 

I enjoyed parts of it of course, the stuff with the fbi, the money laundering, his wife/girlfriend problems, but the 'over the top office' stuff just wasn't for me, and that was a pretty large part of the movie. &&Nightcrawler catapulted Gyllenhaal to one of my favorite actors. I completely missed it and happened to stumble on it on Netflix one night. Fantastic performance.&&Galorrrme&&https://i.imgur.com/njx4ox9.gif&&When I first saw that movie and he showed up with the scene with that gif I was so fucking blown away. I never saw any trailers for it or anything, so it was awesome.&&I so love this introduction.. and I always giggle as well. Hehe, really well done.&&Now add Charles Manson face tattoos&&Yeah but he lost to Christoph Waltz so, I can’t be that upset about him not losing that one, Waltz was great in Django as well&&I mean, much of Tarantino's style is literally derived from exploitation cinema.&&I'm personally holding out for Michael Cera.&&A Shia-surprise!&&Say...what ever happened to that guy?&&Dude's got some background I would say.&&Manson dabbled in Scientology as well...&&If he can do that rage-fueled monologue as Les Grosman, he can be a psychopathic murderer. &&my body is ready&&Nah, he looks like Kevin Costner.&&> I'd rather a relative unknown so I don't see the actor, I see the character.

I agree with this so much.  There are so many times in live action films, and even more so in voice-over, where the popularity of an actor overshadows the character they are playing.  Many times I think a (relatively) unknown actor would serve the story much better.

But of course, that would probably hurt the box office.&&Manson looked pretty weathered at 36. &&Here you dropped \^\^\^\^\^ these

Now that i think about it- great flick.&&Im not putting this as a joke but would Scientologists be cool with him in that role? &&Manson was short though. plus it would be crazy casting.

I'll allow it.&&I was thinking it might be like that, too.  Or that it would be a story about people that happens in and around the manson murders, but the movie isn't really about the manson murders.  Kind of like how Summer of Sam isn't about the Son of Sam killer.&&He proved in Tropic Thunder that he murders it when he had something a little off key&&DiCaprio and Cruise bleeding profusely but refusing to break character in every scene.&&Magnolia Tom Cruise could work well here&&Oui, Shoshanna&&And the original Star Wars Movie was released on the anniversary of the Death Star explosion.&&I’m not saying unilaterally releasing non fictional films on anniversaries of the events they depict is a bad thing.

Nancy Kerrigan got a happy ending. Sharon Tate had her unborn child cut from her before being murdered while begging for her mother. It’s not the same situation.&&The attack happened on January 6th and I, Tonya premiered on September 8th at TIFF and was theatrically released in the U.S. on December 8th. Other than winning several awards from multiple awards shows and film critic organizations on January 6th I can’t find anything on it being released on that day.&&Scorsese has so many great sounding projects in development.

Hopefully he gets to most of them.&&It's going to end up like The Snowman. Scorsese is going to drop it and they're going to scramble to find another director with not enough prep time.&&There's a ton of dream movies that might not get made. Movies that may have good people behind them. Jamie Foxx with that Mike Tyson movie and apparently Scorsese was talking about making a Ramones movie. I don't know if any will ever happen. Especially since most people only ever get one movie. I heard that Hank Williams movie was bad which is too bad because that's the only one he'll get. I wouldn't trust anyone else to make them is what I'm saying.&&He'll find the Klingon N-word for sure. &&That sounds interesting but personally I think a Tarantino movie in the Star Wars universe would be spectacular.

I feel like the Holmes part was put in because his editor was like ""no one is going to buy a book about an architect building stuff, spice it up"".&&I’m not sure what you mean? The book was amazing&&After Hateful Eight I'm 100% on board for more of him &&I just rewatched that two weeks ago and you're making me want to go watch it again already.&&You see Good Time?

The Departed is one of the best movies since the turn of the century, easily. It's so damn good. If anyone hasn't seen it, you're missing out big time. The huge cast and Scorsese knocked it out of the park.&&Checkout basketball diaries 
&&If you haven't already, watch The Departed&&that soundtrack. &&My bad, thought it came out mid-2015. But there’s going to be a three-and-a-half year gap between The Revenant and this new movie.

And hasn't been in any significant since.&&Maybe his life as a Scientologist was simply preparing for this role.&&it definitely would, that's why you see things like... ScarJo as The Major in Ghost in the Shell :/ However, QT has enough draw off his own reputation to cast excellent but relative unknown/forgotten actors which sets them off to the rest of Hollywood (most notably recently being Christoph Waltz).

That said, Cruise is a great actor when given a script worth a shit and if it was 1998 instead of 2018 I think his manic charismatic intensity would have fit Manson well, but that ship has sailed. &&He doesn't look that old though. &&I remember watching an interview with Spielberg on making ""Catch Me If You Can"" with Dicaprio shortly after Titanic skyrocketed him to super-stardom.

I suggest you read Helter Skelter, it does a good job seperating the wild rumours and speculation surrounding the murders from what actually happened.

Award speech edit: Just wanted to add onto this comment that spreading this kind of misinformation is much more damaging to Sharon Tate's (And the other victims) memories than releasing this movie on the anniversary of their deaths.&&It took him over a decade to get Silence done and then everyone reacted to it with a resounding ""eh, not bad"". &&It will get made whenever Gullimero Del Toro finishes all his projects. &&Rumored Ramones biopic would be amazing helmed by him. &&Tarintino should direct Devil in the White City and Roman Polanski should direct this. &&p***Q&&Samuel L.

I also think DiCaprio was way better in Catch Me If You Can and The Aviator than he was in The Departed.&&Yup, same with me, The Departed was phenomenal.&&I guess it's about taste. I really enjoyed the departed, but in the genre I'd rather watch goodfellas. And if it's about DiCaprio I also loved more Scorsese Shutter island, which comes really close to inception for me, or Django and even the wolf of wall street.

Edit: Although Silence was nominated, La La Land won for Best Cinematography (Source: The Intrernet).&&I enjoyed *Silence* **very** much. Excellent, understated, beautiful film. One of Scorcese's recent masterpieces.

I think that has become an unfortunate issue with any new Scorcese film: it's impossible not to automatically (even if subconsciously) compare it to some of the best movies to ever hit the screen. You really have to make an effort to try to avoid that (or I do, at least). &&For myself, I would’ve liked it better if the roles were switched.

There was word she might be Sharon Tate in this but it sounds like it's Margot Robbie's role at this point. So in theory, Tarantino only has 1 more movie left to make and it's small odds she can be in that one either.

Behind every tradition lies a revolution.  Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country’s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge. To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.&&Ohhhh so it was all viral marketing for the movie? &&Ah, so, that's where this timeline ends up.&&*finds comfortable seat to watch upcoming shitstorm.*

""Hopefully they don't hold a grudge""&&Right? I had to check the sub to make sure it was real.&&hey, that's the same synopsis as the other purge movies..&&>  To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year

I'm having trouble figuring out what that's supposed to mean. One percent of what? Like, you can define crimes in terms of ""per one hundred thousand,"" so a murder rate of 6 per 100k (i.e., for every 100,000 people living in this area, 6 are murdered every year) could be called a murder rate of 0.006%, but that's just an odd way of phrasing it.

Right now, in my state, according to the FBI, there's a reported violent crime rate (this includes murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) of 285.2 per 100,000. Calculating it the way I did before (i.e., 6 murders out of 100,000 people = 0.006% murder rate) gives us a violent crime rate of... 0.285%. Guess we don't need the purge in my state?

It’s going to be a bumpy fucking ride! &&Hahaha... you still think the darkest timeline ever ends&&2018 - The FY 2018 Budget is finally passed with funding for Trump's Wall. The Sinaloa cartel, fearing reduced traffic into the US attacks several of the construction workers surveying the border. The media fuels the country's fear of violent crime in the following months by focusing on the violence committed by the cartels and the few instances committed by immigrants before the midterms. Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate thanks in part to the public's fears of rising violent crime and voter suppression policies that disproportionately target the poor and minorities.

2019 - The US economy collapses, civil unrest runs rampant across the country. President Trump declares martial law and calls for a constitutional convention to finally address America's most serious issues. The delegates (who are mostly right wing thinkers and business leaders) are called by the President and his supporters, ""The New Founding Fathers."" 

2020 - The 28th Amendment is narrowly ratified by the states, and the US is set to begin the first ""Purge"" on March 21. Close to a million people are killed, mostly immigrants, ethnic and religious minorities, and the homeless. HUD, and the Department of Health and Human services report their first budget surpluses by the end of the year. President Trump is narrowly re-elected, and many of the ""New Founding Fathers"" find their way into the Congress and his cabinet.

... Yeah it doesn't really work, and they'll probably replace Trump with a caricature stand in like the Jesus-freak President in Escape from LA, but this was about the most grounded version of events I could think of.&&I feel like there's a lot of anger in our society.

>>Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020.

>>“Are you ready?” he said. “ ‘Keep America Great,’ exclamation point.”

>>“Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted.

>>Two minutes later, one arrived.

>>Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’ ” Trump said.

>>“Got it,” the lawyer replied.

>>“Keep America Great.” It just rolls off the tongue, right? The only problem is, it’s already taken ... 

>Yeah, Trump’s new slogan is literally the same exact one used in the fittingly titled horror movie “The Purge: Election Year.”

>(You really can’t make this stuff up.)

>Actually, the movie basically made the slogan as a way to troll Trump. While discussing the film, star Frank Grillo told Comicbook.com:

>>“In the beginning when we shot the movie it wasn’t called Purge: Election Year,” Grillo reveals. “Oddly enough, the guy who plays the President in the movie, he plays him like Trump - totally by accident. There’s a lot of parallels between the GOP race and the movie and the messages that are being put forward and then Universal got this great idea to call it Purge: Election Year.”

&&Yes, because the marketing for the film was in the middle of primaries. The movie slogan comes from Trump; not the other way around. He even registered it as a service mark in July of 2015.&&With the film coming on the 4th of July too. All seems very deliberate.

Honestly a president that markets novelty items is already shite. I never saw Obama trying to sell me a pair of knives or some stupid shit.

People would act but we're talking maybe 1 percent of people would use the purge to do anything that wrong.  People don't want to rape murder and loot, people actually do care about other people.  Rape and murder are so fowl that I doubt most people can think of it in anything outside of a fetish setting (both consenting adults) or a video game.    People don't want to commit crimes even if this movie claims otherwise.

Although Jon Bernthal has aced it, I have no complaints.&&[deleted]&&The premise is the only thing that’s not flawed. Execution is trash though.&&I'm not sure I'd agree that he played him like Trump ""by accident""... I think it's more likely that he played someone with symptoms of sociopathy and there happens to be a large degree of convergence&&That's.... I dunno, sad? &&Well, Biff from BttF 2 was originally modeled off Donald Trump and that he was supposed to be President, but then someone said it was too outlandish for a man like him to become president based solely off his wealth.

So they made him the Casino Tycoon type person and kept everything else.&&They should have paid to put a trailer immediately after the state of the union. &&It was both.  Make America Great Again was taken from Reagan, Keep America Great!, his tagline for his 2020 reelection, was taken from The Purge.  &&The Purge also stole that from Reagan.&&They're talking about the new tagline for his 2020 re-election: ""Keep America Great""&&[deleted]&&Someone didn't scroll down before claiming no one cares.&&Fun little concept, dogshit execution. This? This is bait.&&Yeah the premise is so flawed. Our laws come from our morals, not the other way around. Just because you make something legal for a day doesn't change the morality of it.&&*""It's just a purge, bro!""*&&That's why you wait til next purge to kill that fucker. &&Only seen one Purge movie (I forget which one), but weren't the majority of the bad actors wearing masks?  Like they still wanted to be anonymous? &&Yeah. There’s no way I’d be able to chill and forget that shit. Hell, the fact that the guy wouldn’t be expecting it would make the first few steps a *lot* easier to accomplish. Wrath of the biblical variety doesn’t wait for schedules.&&[deleted]&&I'd expect a lot more vigilante and revenge killings. I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone when I read or hear about some super disturbing stories of people abusing animals, molesting children, and other things that make you wish the people who did it got what they deserved. I'm not sure if a majority of people would pull the trigger themselves but certainly way more people would if they not only could get away with it, but could do it legally and even be praised for it in some cases. &&That's literally the entire premise behind the Purge.&&Gonna have to agree with you. The vast majority of Mericans aren't the absolute worst people imaginable. Theft would be the biggest thing. But... There's definitely enough psychopaths in a mass of over 300mil people to make it pretty murderous and rapey. Just perhaps not quite as murderous and rapey most might think.&&That's what I'm saying. If the purge happens you best believe I'm going to try and get materials for a good pc setup.&&Hmm. Perhaps an imperfect analogy, but bear with me.  

At a daycare I know of picking your child up on time was a rule, but it was also rarely enforced. Parents would typically police themselves simply out of guilt. The day care would also be very understanding of emergencies. Shit happens.  

Eventually the day care imposed a fine for picking children up late. Suddenly the number of kids picked up late increased. Perplexing. See, the parents had been guilted into doing the right thing before, and never really thought of even doing it to begin with. But when you impose a fine, you're really just putting a price on it.  

Even worse, when the daycare removed the fine, things didnt return to normal. The late pick ups increased even more, as the parents who couldnt afford the fine were now absolved of both guilt and monetary payment.  

TL:DR People typically police themselves via their own morals. Laws don't really do anything to stop people, they are really there to punish people who break them. But put the idea into peoples minds that ""its ok"" and the morality of things begins to break down. At least for some, who are a little closer to the so called ""line"".&&Except anyone with stuff worth looking is gunna have paid guards with top of the line gear protecting their stuff&&>People don't want to commit crimes

But people are still getting raped...&&Even in the movies, a large number of people just go into hiding.  And in the other movies it has been going on a number of years so it has become more 'normal'.

Lets say 0.1% of the population goes all murder death kill.  In a city like New York, that gives you 28.21 crazy people per square mile.  Then you have the people getting into battles trying to just steal stuff, people just defending themselves, people trying to protect others and people getting paid to do it.

For comparative numbers, about 1.1% of the population suffers from schizophrenia,  2.6% bipolar, 0.75% narcissistic personality disorder, 1.4% borderline personality disorder, 1.25% psychopathy.

Keep in mind that a significant percentage of those are going to overlap, are being actively treated for their issues and/or are not extremely severe.  However, in a world where it is 'normal' to go out and kill people once a year it isn't too crazy to believe some counselors would actually recommend taking out their issues on others once a year.&&[deleted]&&And then i say forget ma and pop joints, hit the big box stores.

Then someone else said private security firms would form offering their services for Purge night and major chains would hire them for exactly that reason.

So yeah, irl Purge would probably be pretty low key.&&Ignoring the stupidity of ""break any law, except *this* one""... it doesn't matter. The majority of the population would rebel, including their guards and the military.&&Canadian tire better lock its shit up.&&Here’s the plan: deport all your competitors and use that to sell tacos from a truck. &&[deleted]&&""this episode: dumb President!""&&The FBI can make your life a paperwork nightmare, raid your property, seize your computers, assets, and paperwork for ongoing ""investigation.""

I think they actually train CIA agents to do this.  
  
Instructor: Today's lesson, agent-candidates, is on going rogue.  Can anybody tell me *WHY* we go rogue?  
Carson: [Raises hand] Uh, because the Agency suddenly turned against us with no explanation?  
Instructor: Alright, maybe- but no.  That never happens.  Anyone else?  
Johnson: [Raises hand] I know- because the Agency's hands are tied, and we have to do what it takes to complete the mission even if that means going rogue.  
Instructor: No, you IDIOT.  We're the fucking CIA.  If we can't do whatever we please, we might as well go home and play with our barbies.  Get the fuck out of my classroom, you moron!  Anyone else?  I'll spot you 10pts on your final if you can come with a reason stupider than Johnson's.  
[muttering in back...]  
Instructor: Care to share that with the rest of the class, Garrett?  
Garrett: What I said... Sir, is that if I was going to go rogue it would be for deeply personal reasons, and that I'm not about to tell them to everyone in a full fucking classroom just so my handlers can go back and review the video when I *DO*.

Here's a question. What if the day after the purge, a bank just refused to give anyone any money? Like, it was all in there possession during the purge. Couldn't they ""steal"" it then, and then  legally own it afterwards?&&Yeah see this is never properly referenced or addressed, but if an actual purge were announced there would be plenty of sanctuary places with well armed people entirely willing to defend innocents.

While I don't think the family plans to eat the boy, I definitely read the novel more pessimistically. I think ultimately life is over on earth. There are no wild things, nothing grows, there is no sunlight. The only things to eat are human flesh and the occasional pre-disaster can of beans, both of which will eventually run out.

By weird I mean rude and not self aware. Watch his interviews, esp the ones with the blonde dude who costared in the Room. 

No doubt Tommy would have taken up all the speech time, and most likely have said something offensive or inappropriate without realizing he was doing so.&&this feels so patronizing&&everyone's wondering how Tommy Wiseau ended up on stage at the Golden Globes, and I'm just wondering how ""Get Out"" is a musical or comedy.&&Fuck that was weird and a bit awkward.

I saw a couple of interviews where it's just James talking about the film and whenever Tommy is brought up he just kind of starts laughing as if to say ""yeah that weirdo"".

Still gold to this day.&&The Disaster Artist was mainly a story about Greg, yet he's hardly receiving any attention.

It was great! Greg doing Tommy's voice was better than Franco, imo&&co-written with Tom Bissell&&im CERTAIN James franco had a mutual talk with greg before he even bought the rights to the book, that any positive attention would be praised back to tommy instead of greg to keep him playing.

Tommy obviously had to try.&&""Fuck da oscars!""&&He would've probably thanked his hometown New Orleans, Louisiana.&&>they didn’t really have time to both give a speech.

Most likely. We really have no idea what was behind it, but there are so many possible reasons that don’t have anything to do with James Franco being an ungrateful jerk. Tommy looked happy and I’m happy for him!&&Then he has to exit the stage back to his seat in the back. Hopefully they interview him after.&&Franco's reaction really made it look like they had talked about it before and Wiseau knew he wasn't supposed to say anything. 

It's entirely possible that Franco probably cleared it with the showrunners that he could bring Wiseau up but only on the condition that Wiseau wouldn't speak. &&That whole exchange was perfectly played. You can tell there’s real affection for each other and Tommy actually has some self awareness now.&&They let Nicole Kidman go on FOREVER at the beginning though...&&> To be fair, they didn't really have time to both give a speech.

I don't know if you've seen the disaster artist but given the raw material they could've easily made a 2 hour movie of making fun of this strange weird guy, but instead they took the time to humanize Tommy.


They showed his weirdness and all, but also his amazing self belief and his flawed but beautiful relation with Greg, as James Franco said himself ""this is a movie about friendship"".&&Nah. Go listen to Maron's WTF with Franco from a month or two ago. The whole interview Marc is basically like.... ""This guy Tommy is a fucking weirdo..."", and Franco seems to have a really healthy grasp of the whole situation. I mean to be honest, Tommy really is pretty much a weirdo... I mean objectively he's at the very least a kind of fringe-character in society. But Franco very clearly has a lot of compassion for him. &&It does kind of seem that way, doesn’t it? The only thing that makes me think that Franco isn’t being a dick like that was seeing his portrayal of Tommy in the movie. It wasn’t a caricature or parody, but a near perfect mirror of this enigmatic man. A performance like that can only be born out of respect.&&I feel like that's the view most of the people have on Tommy. Even here on Reddit you see people conspiring about where he came from, where he got the money or how he his. But when James does it on TV (Jimmy Kimmel iirc), we see a face and voice doing it, not just words on the screen. I think he is just as 'passionate' about the figure 'Tommy Wiseau' as most of the people are, but since he has this douchbag kind of face, vibe and way of speaking, he comes of as an asshole mocking the guy. &&I assume most celebrities are like that, not down to earth.&&How's his sexlife?&&Greg Sestero was sitting among the audience. If Tommy would just throw the ball over the audience to Greg it would've been historic&&I will make it legal.&&Even if you did let him speak, he doesn't get to speak before James. It's his acceptance speech.&&>Disaster Artist&&What is up with the comments in this thread?

And I only watched Get Out for the first time a few days before The Disaster Artist, so it's not time clouding my memory.&&His work in Black Mirror a few years ago is one of my favorite actor performances ever. He's awesome.&&He left his stupid comments in his pocket.&&Not to mention Tommy very well may have said something incredibly strange and offputting. &&It's the Golden Globes, I distinctly remember drunk Ricky Gervais just roasting people at it and its enjoyment coming from how it's not taken seriously.&&Oh yes. No doing I have no problem with how it went down. I just wanted some Tommy.&&More than likely he would have said Thank you to everyone thay loves The Room, but its entirely possible you’re correct in your assumption haha&&I'm a rooster illusion&&DDL to Wiseau: “you’re a bastard from a basket!!” &&I don't read the script. Script reads me&&And then the follow-up: donald trump is President.

Weird times we live in.&&>I would have politely asked you what you were smoking or high on and if I could partake because that sounds like some mighty fine shit. 

California *did* just start recreational cannabis sales this week...&&I didn't realize I'd get blue-balled by Franco today. I'm not sure I can go to sleep without a speech from Tommy.&&James Franco won a Golden Globe for best actor as James Dean in 2002. I remember that win because I loved the performance and didn't find Freaks and Geeks until several years later. What should be more shocking is the lack of nominations/awards for GARY OLDMAN who won tonight. He seriously was only recognized recently (by the GG, AA) for Tinker Tailor?  Immortal Beloved is in my top faves, Fifth Element being a guilty pleasure, and I mean, cmon....Dracula!? 

Stop having these award ceremonies unless they're adding more genre categories. &&DDL has a wtf presence to him normally. I think he could pull it off just fine.

But Franco did it bout perfect.&&Me underwear&&I want Tommy to take the Oscar and just walk out of the theater.

No one ever hears from again. Greg Seterso doesn't even know where he went. &&Let Tommy present
&&You are looking too into it. Have you seen Tommy interviewed?

James won, he was going to speak. Tommy would have talked jibberish through the whole 60 seconds. &&""Hi Tommy! You're our favorite director!""&&Franco to event organiser: ""Hey, so, if I win tonight I want to bring Tommy up on stage, ok?""

Event organiser: ""Well, it's an individual achievement award so typically we only allow one person...""

Franco: ""C'mon, it's the only way the guy is ever going to get a moment like this, and he's kinda the reason I'm nominated at all.""

Event organiser: ""Ok, *if* you win you can invite him on stage.""

Franco: ""Can he say something on the mic?""

Event organiser: ""Fuck no!""&&You invited all of my friends. Such a great idea. &&""The Room"" exists in the same universe as ""General Hospital"" confirmed.&&WHAT A GREAT STORY, JAMES&&The more I think about it, the more it makes sense he cut him off before he started.

&&'Tommy-Blocked'&&He was probably going to go with his ""Yu can laff, yu can cry, yu can express yorrself, baht plis do not huut each otha""&&""And giving him to me""&&I mean, it was only natural that Wiseau gets most of the attention. 

Greg is a cool guy, and certainly has an interesting story, but he simply can't compete with the sheer excess of personality that Tommy exhibits. Tommy Wiseau is unlike anybody else on the planet. 

The uniqueness of his mannerisms and personality are unparalleled by anyone else in the public eye. Greg simply doesn't evoke as much of a reaction, even if he is the one who carries the story. 

&&[deleted]&&Ha ha ha, what a story Greg! &&Greg introduced the screening of The Disaster Artist I was at (he was actually at the premiere of his own movie starring himself and Tommy) and he really does seem to care about Tommy.&&That's exactly what I saw and thought. They were tears of joy for Tommy. Greg is a stand-up dude.&&Greg's impression of Tommy is so funny. I love it&&Greg's Tommy impression is the definitive one. Franco is okay, but Greg channels the man's spirit. &&Sucks he didn't get any credit tonight.&&Oh yeah because he was actually around tommy for a long time. &&true
&&Yeah - he looked sad, even a bit teary. But I don't think he was upset about his name not being mentioned. This is a guy who has spent decades in Tommy's shadow. He's used to it. It seemed more like he was overwhelmed that his dream had come true. That, and genuine tears of joy for Tommy.&&I don't think people would have been nearly as interested without Greg's story being out there. A lot of the fun of The Room is the mystery surrounding Tommy and the insane stories from behind the scenes, most of which Greg put out there in The Disaster Artist.&&Some friends and I went to The Disaster Artist in Denver and he looked completely wiped out. [Here is a pic for reference.](https://imgur.com/a/ILfKQ)

It seems to me that most people go to these events because they want to know more about Tommy more than anything. At the Q&A, most people asked questions about Tommy.&&Saddest moment of the night, perhaps the year.&&Wiseau was already walking up to the stage before he was even asked to come up. I hope to give as little fucks as this strange man one day. &&shut it down, shut it all down&&When Wiseau reached for the mic, he probably moved his finger to the ""full-nuclear option"" button. &&Please lord &&We need an AMA of Wiseau’s neighbor/friends from NOLA. &&'What Tommy Wiseau Would Have Said' will be one the biggest 'What If' stories in the history of the world.&&I'm pretty Tommy's speech would just be dubbed anyway.&&Who’s accusing him of being an ungrateful jerk?&&I have to disagree about Franco being “an ungrateful jerk”. He invited him on stage, that was amazing! But it was Franco’s moment to take. &&I was sad about that. He should've gone to the press.&&>Tommy actually has some self awareness now.

""AHAHAHAHAHA"" - Tommy Wiseau
&&Which is what caused the time crunch for literally the rest of the show. 

It was kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario for the program director though. How you gonna go about playing off a prominent female figure as she talks passionately about female empowerment and the ""me too"" movement? Answer: Don't even try.&&She is a slightly bigger star than Tommy Wiseau. &&Hits Glenn Close&&Y'all see my movie The Rampart?&&Isn't that the curse of these award shows? You let your face slip once and some camera caught it and everyone is judging you for it.&&[I came all the way over here for this?](https://i.imgur.com/VEoug3A.jpg)&&I think he's more bewildered by Tommy Wiseau.&&We can still cross our fingers for the oscars though, pray hard 🙏&&The greatest showman was Hughs attempt at bringing back the old MGM era films. Musical related. He spoke alot about how that era of films influenced him and his career. When you put that much emotion and passion into a film and lose, no matter how good willed you are its gonna sting a little. &&I'm not familiar with his, story mind elaborating?&&Franco was like ""haha no, no buddy you aren't getting to actually say anything""&&They definitely had a stroke near the end. &&Next stop **The Room 2**.&&Greg has that dead look behind his eyes nowadays. I wonder what he's thinking.&&Greg was visibly perturbed, to put it lightly. &&This award was for Best Actor, not best picture. It's specifically about James' performance as Tommy. &&I mean Greg Sestero would be another Z-list actor who faded into obscurity had it not been for Tommy Wiseau. &&That's a very tommy wiseau thing to do after all 😂&&And one with a sad ending a tragedy, IIRC.&&And several being thrown lazily out of windows.&&Well it was more to advertise that he had him on stage. The award was more about the moment for Franco and his brother than it was about wiseau. &&🎶Stay woke🎶&&That would just be the opening line and it would be all downhill from there &&""You can love someone deep inside your heart, and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live.""
&&I've seen the film and I agree that it paints Tommy in a good light and shows him as an eclectic and misunderstood soul that just wanted to make a movie but I'm talking about the way that I've seen James interact with Tommy in a live situation. It's much easier to plan out and map how an audience perceives a character in a film (probably took at least 2 years from pre through post-production) than it is to be genuinely kind to someone in the heat of the moment.

Again, maybe Franco is just awkward and this is his way of dealing with Tommy. I definitely get why he didn't let him speak but to go up and do an impersonation of him in front of millions with Tommy standing right there? Seems a bit cruel.&&[deleted]&&Possibly he had to take one of those freak, emergency late afternoon dumps. &&Yeah, I didn't love the Greatest Showman but it definitely seemed to be his passion project, so it makes sense that losing out to Franco would hurt.&&[deleted]&&....did anyone think he would win?

Heck, I didn't even know he was nominated. I figured it was just a race between Kaluuya and Franco. Jackman definitely gave a Golden Globe worthy performance last year, I just didn't know it was in *Greatest Showman*... maybe I should see it? &&And lets prey on people reacting not perfectly generous in the first 12 milliseconds when the winner is getting called...
&&I'm still wrapping my mind around the irony of a musical about Barnum being a nice guy. &&Eh. The studio decides what category to enter the film in. It's on them.&&[deleted]&&I'm fairly sure that it's in the correct category. It's a satire film, a very dark comedy&&Your memory isn't the one clouded. 

It's the HFPA voters. They were buzzing about Get Out literally a year ago. The Disaster Aritst, on the other hand, a month ago. 

I'm not here to judge on which one is the better one. But, I agree with OP's comment. Get Out probably would have a hella lot more of heat toward winning this award and Disaster Arist fading out had these movies reversed their release dates. &&Well, that is life.&&No, he would've just opened the floor for a little q & a.&&Oh, Hi Harvey, how's your sex life?&&That's exactly why we wanted him to speak.&&THATS WHAT WE FUCKING WANT

JESUS CHRIST DO WE NEED MORE ""THANK YOU TO PRODUCERS AND INSIDERS WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF""

NO WE WANT CRAZY ASS MOTHERFUCKING OFF THE RAILS WACKOS THATS HOW THIS INDUSTRY WAS BUILT&&I miss Ricky Gervais hosting that show. That ""I'm enjoying this drink as much as the next guy"" joke he did for Mel Gibson still cracks me up today. &&[deleted]&&I wouldn't be surprised if it was staged too and James told him to do that. &&I vote that he would have told us his age, where he's from, and where he got his money.&&He’s known to be hateful of many celebrities who said they love The Room, e.g. Kirstin Bell so it might’ve been the best for him to not have spoken lol  
  
EDIT: Found the quote!  [Link](https://tv.avclub.com/tommy-wiseau-ends-a-lengthy-chat-about-his-new-sitcom-b-1798275362) 
> But you can see very clearly the mainstream media, they don’t see that. They prefer bullshit like Jimmy Kimmel’s show, a redneck asshole, basically, I’m sorry to say that, okay? Because they put Crystal Bell [Kristen Bell] on the program, and she advertised The Room and she’s supposed to be a fan of The Room, this is ridiculous stuff! So for example Blu-ray. Nobody talk about Blu-ray. There’s only one Blu-ray you have in the entire world. Even Sony, now I’m working with them, so we’ll see how we’re doing. But it’s, again, some of the biggest stars were supposed to support The Room, they’re bashing The Room, at the same token, what did you do lately? Did you show your nice legs? She would say, “Oh, I’m a businesswoman.” What type of businesswoman you are? Are you telling me, when you’re born, 6 years old, you knew about acting? How to behave yourself and the quirky smile and the squeaky voice, you think you own the world? I’m sorry, you’re not! You’re not Elizabeth Taylor. You’ll never be her. Because you don’t have range. I’m sorry, sweetie. Okay, and all the actresses are the same, they’re making 20 million dollars, what did you do? I can create actors who give 20 million dollars with the best of the best. Give me media. So again, I speak out very openly so don’t bullshit with me. We have the fans, people enjoy it, so give the credit where it’s due.   
  
  
EDIT 2: “DAE anyone think he talks like Trump?” Guys, Wiseau is just a crazy dude, of course he’s going to sound like another crazy dude, you don’t have to keep commenting that&&The dudes are emerging...&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Tonya harding, Tommy Wiseau, and ERIC WAREHEIM were all thanked and on camera tonight, this is the darkest timeline&&And where the paralegal from Suits would be a member of the British royal family.&&When they turned on the Large Hardon Collider they *changed* something, man&&The legend continues.&&I want Tommy to leave Greg a riddle that if solved would give out his location, but since it's wtitten in Wiseau and not standard english, nobody would be able to decipher the damn thing and he would remain hidden forever.

Tommy wanted to jump in and start talking but regardless it would've sounded way worse if Franco interrupted him *while* he was talking.

I'm guessing Tommy told Franco what he wanted to say if Franco won, to which Franco said no beforehand. And I'm sure what Tommy wanted to say would have been hilarious for all of us. Look at Franco's reaction when Tommy just goes for the mic, he let's out a genuine laugh. I'm going to guess Franco imagined what Tommy was going to say and laughed at the thought of that being said on the stage during an acceptance speech at the golden globes being broadcast all over the planet.

Also that is Franco's time to shine. Franco has been selfless in his admiration and thankfulness for Tommy, as he should be.

The general consensus based off the responses I've personally seen was all midrange. Most didn't really like it and such including the friend I watched it with. I absolutely fucking loved it. The skeleton of the plot is something I've seen thousands of times, but the execution was fucking beautiful imo. I get really into music, and the emotions that Jackman gave to the audience and made them feel was a fucking experience, maybe its just me who felt it to that degree. I don't know much about the study of film making and movies besides that I watch them a lot, but I personally think that The Greatest Showman inherently cannot be liked by every person in a a given audience. Its stylistic choices seem out there enough for it to no longer be 100% inclusive, mainly really speaking about the musical format, but the music hit me in all the right places.&&This makes me want to be there singing so bad.

I don't think this is it. Franco and Rogen have been unkind (to say the least) while talking about The Room promoting this movie. They say it has 'heart', but they are very much loving it for the fact that is (I personally haven't seen either) a train wreck and a laughable at that.&&Yeah, the movie definitely feels like the work of a misogynist.

However this critic basically said it was completely lacking in that regard. Had me thinking that it seems some critics consider the movie bad because it wasn't an outlier level of extraordinary. Either that or some critics have relatively stubborn emotional side? Or perhaps I personally am more sensitive to it and more attuned to that. Whichever is the case, another user mentioned that The Greatest Showman parallels the man the movie is about. It was the general audience and populace that loved PT Barnum's shows and critics/higher society disliked it. Seems similar with this movie and that's pretty amusing to me.&&This is for church, honey. NEXT!!&&Yeah he said something in the beginning of the Q&A about “rumors being spread about me. Don’t believe everything you hear on the internet”

But he didn’t go into detail. That’s why the fan brought it up&&I did the same thing. ""What does 'being spread' mean?"" 

If this was anyone else we would have understood it as the rumors being spread but because it's Tommy W we were searching for the weird. &&Well don't leave us hanging, what's his favorite color? Oh wait don't tell me, it's probably black...&&People who start out with long intros to questions are the worst.&&Like that dude who sued that British guy for pointing out that his games seemed liked scams and then steam started to pull that dudes games from steam. 

I just looked it up. Jim Sterling was the dude who got sued. https://kotaku.com/angered-game-developer-sues-game-critic-jim-sterling-fo-1765484317 for 10 MILLION dollars. Sterling made a video about how the lawsuit was literally gibberish too. Like it made no sense. The dude insisted on representing himself.  &&Wiseau saw an opportunity to latch onto mainstream Hollywood when they adapted this, he'll bend to fit whatever narrative he wants to push to stay in that lane. He's going to get left behind, it's not a good movie and it wasn't intended to be a comedy as he's trying to say now. &&I'm the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude...&&cheep cheep cheep cheep&&Or Aziz Anzari’s cuss&&Little did you know Mort actually shined. You just didn't see it because he *crushed it*. &&Mort was too busy cleaning up Binky's shit in the stables anyway...&&It was cool of Dave to be coy about it and try to just let James have his moment. Also really cool of James to bring them up.&&Either you come up accepting that, no matter what you do, your best friend, who won't win a prize ever for being the nicest guy EVER, is still fascinating for a lot of people, or just quit hanging with him.

I think by this point he already accepted the former. &&Well the fact is that Barnum exploited people for how they looked etc. It wasn't some empowerment thing. The film is disgustingly tone deaf when you consider that. &&No we need it to hold at least 20, NEXT&&Only 2 belts? NEXT!!!&&Lol wow I read that wrong.  I thought the rumor was him ""being spread"".

I've been saying for years that Dave is my favourite Franco, but seeing this really redeemed James in my eyes.&&I've watched a lot of interviews of James and Dave. You can tell James is a dominant personality and Dave seems really laid back and reserved to me, he hardly talks. Seems like he is happy to let James take the attention of the crowd most times. &&I want a musical where Thomas Edison goes around electrocuting elephants to make AC look too dangerous to use.

I was like ""Oh man, that's going to be dope, whatever he does with that beat.""&&My high school had a hip hop literature class where they studied kendrick's music. And to our surprise Kendrick's people got contact with our school and he actually came to listen to our interpretations of his music. He was very kind to perform a little afterwards.

The teacher had his own blog that kinda gained popularity and bam yea. This link will have his blog and a video of the whole thing

Even Tyler Perry is gonna get jealous. &&I hope the pop artist soundtracks come back. Like how Toto did the soundtrack for Dune.&&King Kunta remix titled King T'Challa coming.

&&Oh man that's fucking awesome. Reminds me of the Tron/Daft Punk scenario.&&This worked really well on Kill Bill with RZA. I am super excited to see what KL does. &&With how wide a range of music Kendrick’s own material pulls from, his curating the music for this film could be incredibly exciting. It will be interesting to see how it meshes with the futuristic vision of Wakanda &&Kung Fu Kenny is canon??&&I am pretty hype for this movie. It looks waaaay more interesting than the last few Marvel flicks. The colors, costumes, and atmosphere appeal to me more.&&*Grabs popcorn and sorts by controversial*&&Marvel is really at the top of their game with their franchise!&&[removed]&&Oh shit my boy Kendrick is gonna kill this soundtrack! This is the first movie I'm actually excited for in a long ass time.&&It's funny to see people complaining about hip hop and rap being in this movie simply because they are black but no one ever mention and complain about white characters getting metal music, rock, or country in their trailers.&&Its probably gonna be good &&Will the revolution be televised?

Edit: my top comment of all time is about a collab between pink panther and kendrick Llama. 2018 u wild&&This is racist.

Black Panther gets a soundtrack.

But Pink Panther doesn't get a Trap Mixtape?&&I thought it meant the Black Panthers movement and was super confused.&&He already used the beat. It's off of an early mixtape with Jay Rock I believe.

Edit:https://youtu.be/S4UrE0rlGtM

I believe this is it.

Edit 2: lol sorry everyone I believe this is the inspector gadget song. My bad.&&Kendrick seems like such a down to earth dude with all the fame he's acquired&&Your teachers choice of hats is questionable at best.&&Thanks for the share! Lamar’s response to an interpretation as good/better than his is so humble!&&Yeah, I remember seeing the video a while ago. Kendrick really is an amazing role model. 


Would have killed to give my own interpretations of his music to Kendrick. &&Kendrick is for the kids!

For real though,  he's such a great dude and a positive force in this world today. &&Damn, that's cool.&&Might be my end but I’ve only got the audio&&I'm betting the movie will break $1billion global because of all the black people hype.  It'll basically be mandatory attendance even if they don't really like superhero movies.

This makes me more excited for the movie.&&Meh. Its okay for a soundtrack, but both did way better last year on their albums. &&That’s definitely a SZA song.&&I can imagine this for a short scene, but I'm not exactly blown away. &&This is definitely played during the credits.

She needs to find her way into the movies as well&&Did you see the trailer?  It's Run the Jewels and it might be the best trailer music I've seen in years.

Edit:  [Here's the music video for that song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWaljXUiCaE)  You can thank me later, you'll probably be busy watching this on loop for the next hour or so.&&Or, just listen to the soundtrack if you weren't interested in the movie?  (:&&Black Panther movie alone doesnt do it for ya? 
&&Does he watch BET?&&I had to rewind and pause. God I was so hyped!!!&&Or Will Smith and Wild Wild West.&&I mean Tron and daft punk was a match made in heaven. Daft Punks musical themes also sometimes speak to the line that they cross between their robot and their human personas. The Tron legacy story also touched on this with the ISO programs being as naturally occurring and evolving as life itself. Kendrick is african American hip hop/rap. I would have much rather had a genuine African music soundtrack. I could also see this working if Kendrick ends up incorporating African instruments into his rap. Like a heavily stylistic album that pays tribute to that part of music while still maintaining some of it's hip hop roots. This probably won't happen though so I'm pretty disappointed in this announcement. &&Damn I didn't even know RZA did that soundtrack, it's great&&RZA the GOAT producer.&&Is it hard to ask for even an action short film with KUNG FU KENNY. It's his best name by far for me . If Kung Fu Kenny shows up, I'll be rolling &&Thor: Ragnarok begs to differ.&&“The colors” , dude you can’t say that &&There's the soundtrack - which is the topic at hand, and the collection of pre-written songs, or songs written by contemporary artists specifically for the project, included in the film - and then there's the original *score*, which will be composed separately.

Kendrick will curate the soundtrack, while a composer will write the score. I would be shocked if what you're hoping the score will be doesn't end up being what we get.&&> and like they did for the Thor movies with vaguely Viking sounding music

Yes, the classic viking sounds of Led Zeppelin.&&Rap, jazz, hip hop, all have extremely strong roots in African music and culture.&&I guess Jidenna was already used in Luke Cage Season 1!&&You must not have heard any recent african music if what you want are bongos and chanting&&Can confirm, I was at the ""music in film"" panel at SDCC and Ludwiig was there, the man in control of the soundtrack, and he played a tease at a score during the panel. 

It was what you were hoping. Drums, shakers, etc. But there will be some poppy sounding music as well &&Hiphop is big in Africa too. Or did you think modern day africans only listened to tribal music?&&Black Panther is from a fictional part of Africa that is technologically advanced, so imo this music makes sense.&&I don't know what kind of music is currently popular in the area of Africa that the pretend country is in (near Tanzania?). I would bet there is a good chance it's modern, with some electronic/rap in there, maybe it's traditional, or maybe a mix. Now I'm curious.

Edit: top ten in Tanzania - 

http://www.musicians4africa.com/tanzania-music-top-10/

Looks like modern electronic/rap influenced to me, but am at dentist and can't listen&&I've got to say as a Kenyan this film isn't sitting too well with me at the moment. Feels a bit patronising and silly with this advance sci-fi culture and lumping all black culture elements together. It would be cool if they had a Black Panther that mirrors issues in the continent the way Tony Stark and Captain America reflect to some extent issues in American culture.&&Nah, it'll be live&&Because people automatically assume the movie will be pro black live matters just because Kendrick is a successful rapper who’s main appeal is the black community.

Couldn’t care less about their opinion, Kendrick will kill it. Can’t wait for February &&I don't think it's pulled off that well tbh.

I'm South Asian and me and my wife, and all of our friends, black, South Asian, East Asian or Middle Eastern (and Caucasian) and otherwise are hyped af for this movie. This is the first superhero movie featuring a non-white superhero that seems like it was made with the care and quality (that atrocious Catwoman movie with Halle Berry doesn't count), and not only, but actually seems to be placing considerable focus on the characters' culture and ethnicity.

This one is gonna be HUGE, no doubt about it.&&How many of us do you think there are?&&Future generations will watch this in Black History classes. &&It will probably do well. But 1 billion is really way too high. Wonder Woman did really well and didn't get close. 

If the movie does more than 700 it will already be really good, since Black Panter is not that well known.&&Oh yeah.

I’m positive it’s on either TPaB or DAMN, but I can’t find it now. The sample used in the trailer sounds a lot more like I remember it from Kendrick than from the original Gil Scott-Heron song.

Edit: Holy shit I just realized it’s not Kendrick, but from the Homeland season 6 intro. LOL. Now it makes sense. I remember seeing the trailer in the theater and recognizing the quote, and for some reason I instantly went “oh nice Kendrick” but somehow I must have just mixed it up in my head, perfect fit for Kendrick too though, especially fitting with To Pimp a Butterfly’s themes.

Here it is: https://youtu.be/GXsw4_Ebr2Q

I guess homeland did it first. Such a great use of a lyric in both cases though.&&And the crowd goes...&&[deleted]&&might be my favorite RTJ song&&I've always thought to myself that Legend Has It has to be one of El-p's best productions. It's so crisp but subtle. &&That trailer left me fucking shook in the theaters. My friends don’t listen to RTJ so they had no idea what I was freaking out over. &&damn that white guy has gained weight&&Their sound system's probably not as large as a theater's.&&I was mildly interested in the movie, but this is kinda tipping me over the edge to see it in theatres&&Most likely while celebrating February like it’s his B-day&&That album was fire 🔥 &&wicky wicky wild wild west?&&Which went for a very different aesthetic than Black Panther. I can easily see why someone would prefer one over the other.&&The best part about Thor: R is that Tony isn't around to outclass the movie villain in fucking things up for the Avengers.

Half the villains the Asgardians fight against, Tony would probably side with.&&Both are a conscious homage to Jack Kirby. Black Panther basically went for a Kirby/Afro-futurism mix which looks fantastic. &&Ludwig Göransson is composing the score of this film. During the panel at SDCC he played a sampling of some of the music he worked on for the film. If we go by those samples, the film's score definitely leans heavily on its African influences as opposed to the soundtrack, which is going to lean on hiphop + R&B influences. &&I mean, Immigrant Song is literally about Vikings and Norse Gods.&&Only reason they used that song was for the lyrics, which are about Vikings rowing towards the shore and raiding and seeking Valhalla.&&Yeah but there is literally African music that has *always* been there&&Right, but they are their own thing now. They're not African anymore. The US has strong roots in England, but the US has developed into its own distinct culture and society.&&I mean.... they have diverged quite far from those roots. If anything, it's blues that has the clearest roots, and yet you didn't cite it.&&Don't all 3 of those have origins in the United States?&&I don't think roots is the right word. And it's more African American than actually African.&&Yeah sorry that is no excuse. It's been decades, they are now distinct entities. I mean jazz and rap are now distinct, let alone trad African (or even modern  African) music.

I can only hope this is just for the credits and so on, and the actual soundtrack is actually Afro-futurism. I'm going to be cringing pretty hard if they keep shoehorning rap/hip hop in there.&&I hope to God we hear Chief Don't Run in this.

Fucking love Jidenna. Best new artist of 2017 for sure 

Stylistically Long Live the Chief would be so fitting for the challenge fight but that was what got used in Cage  (extremely fittingly too imo)&&Ludwig as in of Childish Gambinos Ludwig?&&To be fair, you have to have very advanced technology to understand rap music.&&Also completely independent and separated from Western-American culture, by that logic is doesn't make sense. The cultural importance for the American audience is what make sense.&&To be fair the nation in the books was isolated and self sustaining. I don't remember specific instances where BP or Wakanda did anything for the continent at large. &&That combination of sci fi with African culture is a huge part of the comic books. You've got a fair point though.&&I wouldn't say what we're seeing in Wakanda is too inconsistent with Afrofuturism, so if they go full-on Afrofuturistic, then I'm sure they'll relate a lot of the film directly to continental issues in Africa.&&As an Asgardian, I've long felt the same about the *Thor* movies. Hopefully they do a better job representing Wakanda and it's people.&&What's wrong with SciFi culture? I'm African too and I love afrofuturism, it's extremely underrated&&As a Mexican, I was very impressed for how well they got the latino vibe in Coco, I was expecting a very Chicano/Miami style.

The story is meh but that whole world just bleeds ""cool"". It oozes from every frame, every character, and every sound.  I would never stop seeing these movies if Disney just came out with a new one every two or three years.  Its just so cool.&&And not even an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. It was at *least* better than 127 Hours and How To Train Your Dragon. Hardcore snubbed.

Same with Best Visual Effects, no nomination, and yet Harry Potter made it in.&&Whenever I can’t sleep I put that soundtrack on and listen to. Love how they put the songs in kinda order from the movie too.

Also, great remix album: https://open.spotify.com/user/milesu/playlist/1kf9Kyg9W2p1TF5d91LvOA?si=9PrJ5nVqSSC2swPBWiIWCg&&The goosebumps I got from hearing the theme played near the beginning in an IMAX theater is still one of my favorite theater going moments.&&Solar Sailer has been on repeat for the past several years for me :)&&I think I did an askreddit some time back about awesome soundtracks to subpar movies... this one definitely made the list along with Queen of the Damned.&&How do you forget about this album. I listen to it at least once a week lol

It just gets me in the zone for whatever I'm doing.

I want Tron 2 just for another soundtrack.&&M83 for Oblivion.&&Phil Collins for Tarzan&&Oh for real? Haven't seen that yet but I love Arcade Fire, I'll check it out&&They're considered pop in the post-rock world, so it works.&&Absolutely - I can't picture FNL in my head without also hearing the beautiful score by EITS. This one is super iconic&&And Girl with a Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl &&Definitely my go to coding music!&&Great movie. Amazing soundtrack. &&Don't forget The Man with the Iron Fists soundtrack that he oversaw too &&And Neil Young on the Dead Man soundtrack, while we’re at it. &&And Kill Bill!&&Yes! Afro Samurai was another amazing Rza score too!&&The Protomen do a fantastic cover of it on their night of queen live album. They do justice for every song they cover for the album, but that is one of a handful where they elevate it beyond cover and into the realm of sublime. &&""Who Wants To Live Forever"" from this soundtrack is my #1 shower song by a wide margin.&&And Iron Eagle&&Trash everything about Highlander for the remake, but KEEP the soundtrack.&&Don't blame Freddie, blame Giorgio Moroder. &&SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE&&BABEEH!&&BAYYYBEEEHHHHH&&I'm upvoting because I love this cheesy song and I'm trusting you know it's not Prince. &&[MJ could never.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulOLYnOthIw)&&Great soundtrack, I caught the movie in a hotel the other week, not a great film but the music holds up.&&Yes he did the score with Atticus Ross. The score and the soundtrack are two completely separate entities.&&Yep, and won an Oscar. Also, he managed the soundtrack for lost highway I believe.&&Don't forget Gone Girl. That soundtrack was unsettling as fuck. &&Dude, it's such a great film! I'm tempted to go watch it now. The use of the soundtrack in it is just amazing.&&Yeah, when I think Elton John songs in animated movies I sure as shit don't think of Road to El Dorado. &&Didn't Elton John only right a few of the songs? It was most written and composed by Hans Zimmer. &&Hey, that was Phil Collins!&&""**DANGER**

**IS** **NO**

**STRANGER**

***HERE***""&&Son of man is one of my favorites. &&He won an Oscar for it.&&I guess I was just trying to say that for how good those two can be, this song didnt impress me as much as i thought i would be when i clicked on it. &&Have you heard the Twilight New Moon soundtrack? I haven’t seen the movie but that soundtrack was amazing. From Thom York to Bon Iver, to Grizzly Bear. Highly recommend it.&&I dunno, Elton John kills it anytime he's got music on a soundtrack. his soundtrack songs also stand on their own, even if you had no idea they were from a movie, they'd still be quality songs. &&It definitely is the end credits song. Most films push the end credits song as the single of the soundtrack because it's the last thing you hear representing the film on the way out of theater. And it sets the tone for what they expect you feel at the end of the film.&&AND SYRUP SANDWICHES &&I didn’t know Afrofuturism was a thing and now I’m disgusted with myself.&&Vince Staples was on Runaways too. Marvel kills it with the music&&BagBak from Big Fish Theory&&Vince also has an unreleased track on the animated Spider-Man trailer &&Yeah, that was in the ~~second~~ main trailer.  The music in these trailers has been crazy strong.

[Here's the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e52vw7RR-A)

RTJ was in the teaser trailer I guess?  Idk why its a teaser if it's 2 minutes long, but sure.&&Pacific Rim. War ready!&&They're going to be opening for most of Lorde's North American tour.&&Kanye samples Gil for the last song on MBDTF, his voice is pretty distinctive so maybe from there?&&I can tell you it's definitely not in DAMN.&&<3 Gil&&RTJ&&I think that was the second trailer.  Song was so on point in it too.&&You haven't been to my local theater :(

Headphones/home speaker setup definitely sounds better than that shit.&&Yea, agreed. I'm excited for both for sure, I just reacted to the ""interesting"" part, but appealing to someone more makes sense if you weren't into the comedic acid trip that was the last few movies.&&hmm, damn you are right&&Hah!&&> Ludwig Göransson is composing the score of this film

Oh hell yes! I loved his work on Creed!&&God damn I love his work on Because the Internet by Gambino.

and RedBone ofc.&&Does Toto make African music?&&DAMN. And To Pimp A Butterfly both feature African culture pretty strongly.&&Yep, these explanations are weak.

I want some bad ass drums in this movie gat damn it.&&Yeah well super vibranium suits are kinda far from those roots too. Things evolve. &&We haven't diverged that far from Snoop or Dr Dre who relied heavily on Afrofuturist spaceman George Clinton. And without him I can't even imagine a Black Panther existing. &&In African-Americans, who brought their African musical roots with them.&&  I was at the ""music in film"" panel at SDCC and Ludwiig was there, the man in control of the soundtrack, and he played a tease at a score during the panel.

It was what you were hoping. Drums, shakers, etc. But there will be some poppy sounding music as well

&&The rap songs will probably play when they hit the American/Western city scenes. &&I dunno how it is in other African countries, but where I am from the most popular musical genres are all Western and Black. There's a lot of Brass Band stuff with all the trumpets and trombones and shit, and it is by far one of the most popular genres there. And of course Rock, Pop, and Hip-Hop have started to make their way over there as well.


But the Big Band stuff is so popular there that when I think ""traditional"" music, it pops into my head alongside the older stuff.&&Chief don’t run would actually be pretty good for this. Good production and it could be an apt title considering Black Panther is literally the chief. The verses wouldn’t fit tho&&Yessir!!&&Aw jeez&&The lyrics are extremely subtle&&To be fair, it's not just the audience. The characters of *Black Panther* might largely be African, but the film is being (again, largely) made by African-Americans. I don't see why the music choices shouldn't reflect that too. &&Its canon (or used to be) that Wakanda has the cure for cancer...but doesn't share it with anyone. That's how isolated they like to be.&&I remember at least a few instances in Marvel UK books where BP was helping out other African nations.&&This interview with Nigerian born actress Sope Aluko will be interesting to you: https://youtu.be/prz5l3mVRiM?t=26m45s

She specifically talks about sharing your concern and having her expectations blown away. She says films depicting Africa will ikely be divided between 'before Black Panther' and 'after Black Panther' So I would suggest giving them a chance. 

It's a Hollywood blockbuster after all, but from interviews with the people involved it sounds like they've worked incredibly hard to get it right.&&That's exactly what it is.&&I mean you try telling a Sudanese guy, a Nigerian, a Ethiopian, and a Angolan that their the same... see how far that gets you. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Truth is that African-Americans were robbed of their culture and that they have in many ways attempted to gain it back, but because they have no base they are forced to go the Pan-African route... which leaves a bad taste in the mouth of any native.&&Yeah, doot doot makes me think of trumpet skeletons.&&thank mr lamar&&> i got i got i got wizardry in my DNA. I got loyalty I got royalty in my DNA.

Chinese audiences were really into Black Panther in Civil War. 

There is definitely some racism in certain markets that can effect actors and films, but Hollywoods response to that has always been to not bother trying. Black actors are often left off of posters, not taken on certain promo tours, barely included in foreign trailers etc., and black films are barely marketed. So they never get a chance basically. On the rare occasion black movie stars and black films are properly marketed overseas, it appears to not be the big problem people think it is. 

When Will Smith was just starting to get big studios didn't want to take him on worldwide promotional tours for his films. So he paid his own way, and became a huge star in all the markets the studios thought he was a liability. &&Yeah but if the movie is about family, ancestors, spiritualism, like what made Coco very successful in China, then it might do pretty good &&I guess they don't notice all the black actors in the fast and furious movies&&They are still frequently considered unattractive (maybe through unfamiliarity, but also the cultural norms of paler skin being more attractive), but the popularity of NBA players suggests they’re not totally against black celebrities. 

Still, it’s a Marvel movie and China loves those. So it should hopefully do well. &&I was expecting an insult but that was actually informative. Thanks.&&Ok I thought you meant M83 scored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and I was very confused&&Grizzly bear did blue valentine &&[Starwaves is an amazing track off Oblivion's soundtrack](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3FaoaWCYE)&&What makes this album so great is that the daft punk had access to a live orchestra. &&My favorite when i started listening to the remixes was the glitch mob remix of Derezzed&&My favorite is the remix of Encom by Com Truise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNYj3HDOUys&&""Behold, the Son of our **MAKER!**""
&&I honestly want this more than I want more Star Wars. Don’t get me wrong, I go see the new movies when they come out, but I don’t seek out the extended stuff (Clone Wars, books, etc.). But I have read or played or watched every extended universe thing for Tron because oh my god the universe is like crack. It’s like you said, it just bleeds cool. &&Honestly, after all the crap that's come out since, it's story isn't really that bad. The more I've watched it the more forgiving I am of it's faults and cherish all the high points of the film. It's strange too cause Clu isn't jarring at all to me while some of these newer CGI characters sprint into the uncanny valley...

I love Tron: Legacy.&&> How To Train Your Dragon

How fucking dare you&&Never has a movie been so clearly out-classed by its soundtrack as Oblivion.

The title track with Susanne Sundfør ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mkUp1V3ys0)) is so good.&&Chemical Brothers for Hanna. &&That movie's like 20 years old though. It was pretty common to have big artists attached to movies then.&&This hits too close to home lol.&&And Quake and Lost Highway, even if it was curation more than composition on Lost Highway.&&For being what it was, it’s damn near perfect. I fully expected it to be some mortgage payment for Forest Whitaker. &&That movie was the first Jim Jarmush picture I saw, and I have been hooked ever since.  I also strongly recommend *Down By Law.*&&Also directed &&Hot take, but I thank that soundtrack for one of the greatest Kanye West songs ever.&&Tom Waits in Night on Earth and Down By Law if we're Jimmying our Jarmusches

Or if we just want to stay in the category of hipster geniuses we can look at Elliot Smith doing Good Will Hunting for Gus Van Zant&&I love the Protomen and just wanted to give you a shout out for mentioning them&&Keep in mind Highlander was an HBO movie, not a normal Hollywood production.&&I knew I needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track&&My name is Giovanni, but everyone calls me Giorgio&&I think the difference is that the Road to El Dorado doesn’t have the characters singing the songs like Lion King does, so it’s a soundtrack by a pop artist, but not a soundtrack for a musical.&&Why not though? That movie is a masterpiece.&&Was just throwing another in there. &&I had the same first impression. Both Kendrick and SZA have had incredible features on other artists tracks, so people saying it wasn't as good simply because it wasn't their own shit doesn't even make sense. I'm hoping it grows on me.&&Marvel is good with licensed music, but their original soundtracks aren’t memorable at all&&Nobody kills it with the music like HBO does. Every single show.&&And the Spider: Into the Spiderverse trailer&&2017 was a big year for Vince and movie trailers. Drink a Sprite.&&Dude that song gave me chills.&&the version they play in the trailer is super cut to pieces and basically not the same song tbh

also mixed w/ Gil Scott Heron

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2StMPjfkUO4&&I had no idea this was something I needed in my life until I heard the announcement last month.&&Me too but I'm pissed that they took ""The Revolution Will Not be Televised"" for a fucking ad&&Thor 3 looked great. Taika Waititi was a fantastic choice to shake up that franchise. However, I'm with /u/GrandArchitect in my preference for Black Panther. The visuals for this are really intriguing to me as it's not something I've seen done on this large a scale before. I don't know what you'd call it, Afropunk?, but the woman behind the visuals of Moonlight and Beyonce's Lemonade is also doing this movie and I'm extremely excited for the visuals alone, even more excited than I was for Thor 3's (and I was very excited for Thor 3).

EDIT: [Hannah Beachler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1667545/) is the name of the production designer that worked on Beyonce's Lemonade, Moonlight, Creed, Fruitvale Station, etc.&&I've been very impressed with his work from when I discovered him back during the Community days and his work on Donald Glover's latest album was also incredible. [Here's a video of him talking about composing the beat for Redbone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGKlIJsz7bM)

They have some really talented people working on this film. The woman responsible for some of the visuals on Moonlight, Creed, Fruitvale Station, and Beyonce's Lemonade is also doing work on Black Panther. 

EDIT: Her name is [Hannah Beachler.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1667545/) &&He is also a frequent Childish Gambino collaborator, he produced, co-wrote, and played a lot of the instruments on Awaken My Love. &&Makes music *about* Africa for sure.&&yeah, i don't think the royal family of Wakanda remembers syrup sandwiches&&I think the point was that Wakanda is supposed to be a xenophobic, isolationist super-tech nation with little influence from the outside world. They would have their own style of music very different from anything American. It's a chance for some Afro-futurism in music, which someone somewhere must have been doing for a while, but I don't know of anyone.&&Almost every genre of american music comes from Africa if you reach back far enough&&Are you talking about Ludwig Göransson? As in the dude who helps write and produce pretty much all of Childish Gambino's stuff? If so, then sick! Didn't know he was composing this. &&Sure, that too, it's an American movie about a character created in America by Americans for Americans.

I'm not American so it doesn't mean anything to me, but I definitely understand and respect the decision.&&well it is an American film created for an American audience, based on an American comic book... should this be a surprise? &&Spoopy &&*mr skeletal&&Thank mr lamar for good yams and dna&&Thank mr lamar for good yams and dna&&https://i.imgur.com/hZl1N7o.jpg&&Thank mr lamar for good yams and dna&&Thank mr lamar for good yams and dna&&I got I got I got I got wizardry got lizardry inside my DNA &&I wish they at least tried to make it fit the meter and rhyme scheme.&&Fr, All them extra syllables.

FTFY&&plus T'Challa in Civil War had those Bruce Lee moves and demeanor. &&I think this movie is about superheroes &&[deleted]&&Random Access Orchestra.&&“.....Userrrr.”&&did you see that Tron show disney put out a couple years back?  it was pretty dope... too bad it was cancelled after the first season.  i guess not enough people watched it because it was animated.&&I'm also a very big fan of Tron. I've always thought the story being bad complaints were way overblown; the story is simple, yes but it is a fitting way to set up a ride through the world that they've built. And really, isn't that the whole point? The worst thing they could've done is added in some elaborate, intricate plot with too many characters and locations (kinda like what Disney has been doing since then).

Perhaps this is a shift in expectations from movie goers. In the 80s and 90s, having a bare bones plot was not considered a negative but at some point there has a lot of asking for movies to have ""bigger scale""

Quite frankly, I think the average audience just doesn't like movies that tell the story through world building. Mad Max: Fury Road, Pacific Rim, Tron: Legacy. All of these tend to have similar complaints and all of them are more or less a chase through their world that they've built up.

Clu isn't jarring because you know he's a digital clone of the young Flynn. The uncanny valley doesn't apply when he's supposed to be an imitation, it actually enhances the character.

Except for that one scene in the beginning where he's in the real world... worst decision in the movie. Only thing I would really change about the movie is showing his face, should've just used a stand-in and kept the face out of the shot.&&I think the fact that we know Clu is by nature an AI makes his uncanny artificial appearance feel more justifiable.&&I love the soundtrack, but I also think the production design was fantastic. It not only sounded like a Mass Effect movie, it looked like one too. &&I truly loved the Oblivion soundtrack.  The pacing is wonky as fuck in Oblivion, but the music and visuals still sell it for me.&&^^^but ^^^I ^^^liked ^^^Oblivion ^^^:'(&&Idk there has been some reaaaally bad movies with pretty good soundtracks.&&The new Tron movie had a better soundtrack and the movie itself was arguably less interesting than Oblivion.&&That's one quirky soundtrack, so fitting to an equally quirky movie. I still listen to it time to time.&&Queen for The Highlander&&....and Natural Born Killers, first! There's a some shots of him working on the soundtrack on this big boxy laptop at the time and I just remember thinking how cool it was that he was sequencing all these songs into one long mix via a portable machine. Trent has always been way ahead of the game.&&[deleted]&&Also acted&&Seriously, [""White Dress""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZBAvstyxA) is a goddamn masterpiece &&A severely underrated band, given how good they are and their library of work.&&such an awesome band. i'm on pins and needles waiting for act III&&Never knew that. Interesting! 

Princes of the Universe is still in my top 10 Queen songs. I really hope they keep it.&&Doot doot doot doo-doot doo-doot doot doot&&Was gonna make this same comment. Elton John is one of pop music’s most recognizable voices, so when I think of Elton John movie soundtrack my first thought is El Dorado, second thought is Lion King. &&The characters sing one song, ""It's Tough to Be a God,"" I think.&&Everyone always forgets Brother Bear. I *love* that movie and Phil Collins' music in it. &&Kendrick does have a feature on SZA's new album (Doves in the Wind - Ctrl) and its definitely better than this. But yes, I think this is just a generic pop song feature that a lot of non-Kendrick/SZA fans will like and it will probably sound fine in the context of the scene it's being played in. I'm predicting a scene with Black Panther and his love interest... Can't wait to hear his song for a training montage or fight scene. 
&&It’s gettin better. The Avengers theme is actually pretty memorable and is starting to really kick in IMO. Doesn’t apply to the whole Marvel scene, but I think they heard that feedback at least. &&What? The avengers main theme is amazing. &&Ohhh boyy, someone watched Every Frame a Painting and thinks they’re an expert on film scores now.&&I agree. But I've also always loved how Top Gear now Grand Tour uses their licensed music. It's just snippets but it's perfect. &&Afrofuturism. It's an art style/movement that's been around for a while but this is the first blockbuster film that incorporates it.&&The instrumentation on Awaken, My Love is immaculate. Ludwig knows his funk.&&I also like his solo stuff, under the name Ludovin.  He did a song called Tricks with Childish Gambino, check it out.&&Right, but Led Zeppelin doesn't make Viking music, they make music about Vikings. That's a distinction. &&That could very well be the case for the score of the music. That's not what this is though, its a tie-in soundtrack.  The point of a tie-in soundtrack is marketing. So getting one of the highest selling and most critically acclaimed rappers of our days to make music for it is potentially a fruitful move.&&Lamar is doing the soundtrack. That's different than the actual score, which is the background music (examples are the wonder woman theme or the avengers theme). The soundtrack is stuff like guardians using Fleetwood mac. &&>  It's a chance for some Afro-futurism in music, which someone somewhere must have been doing for a while, but I don't know of anyone.

[Nigerian](https://embed.vevo.com/?video=UK3AZ1512173&autoplay=0) and to a slightly lesser extent [Ghanian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQT2IszqQZU) pop is absolutely huge in most of West Africa, it's obviously a much, much better example of music which has strong roots in African music and culture than anything American which is... well, African-American, not African.&&Nobody wants to listen to a movie with Sun Ra as the soundtrack &&So do people&&Yes sir. He talked about his research for it. He went to certain places in Africa just to listen to the music.

Did they deal with Tron being Rinzler but also Tron in a weird way? I feel like I remember something being off there...&&Completely agree. I think I'm going to watch it when I get home today.

Ya, that opening scene made him too caring as well. It would have made it a bit more compelling if Flynn was a little distant from his son. I mean, Sam was already pissed at his dad for abandoning him. It would have just made it that much more compelling by leaving the motorcycle helmet on and kind of being a bad dad.

Considering it's a pretty biblical storyline, it'd lend that much more to the allegory that they were going for.&&The Faunts song at the end of the first Mass Effect was fantastic, really gives the sense of going off into a vast galaxy to explore the unknown&&Visually a lot of sci-fi movies from the last 5/6 years have reminded me of Mass Effect. I remember thinking the robot guards from *Total Recall* wouldn't look at all out of place in a Cerberus or Blue Suns fire team.&&I still love that movie &&Yeah I find myself whistling the theme out of nowhere. &&Prince played every single instrument on that soundtrack I believe. Listen to ""Batdance"", electronica sampling ahead of its time, amazing bass line, and his guitar solos are fucking mind blowing. All put together to come up with something insanely unique.&&Saw them a few months ago for the second time and theyre one of the best live experiences I've seen&&Even the TV series understood it's not Highlander without Queen.&&That’s it, though. &&Live to Rise was pretty a pretty good song&&And most people probably couldn't hum it for you on command.  It's amazing for what it is.  It's like a leitmotif in an opera.  It's an emotional trigger and it gets you 100% of the way there when the movie needs you to be.

Try and hum the main theme from Harry Potter or Star Wars or James Bond or even Lord of the Rings.  Add marvel and you have the top 5 money making movie franchises.  Marvel's music might be the most forgettable.

That's not necessarily a bad thing,  it's emotional where it needs to be and it's climactic and inspiring in other places.  It's extremely good music, but I'd have a hard time calling it memorable.&&That's about the only one though. &&...I would. &&What the he'll are you talking about i'd love that&&What?

Otherwise you're pretty much right, and I say this as a *huge* Marvel fan.&&Don't forget Thor Ragnarok's wonderful synth soundtrack. It's got an amazing feel to it, it really worked well to support the aesthetic of the movie.&&Doctor Strange's soundtrack is killer &&The Guardians of the Galaxy main theme is great too.

‘Bright’ Sequel Announced by Netflix,53283,7nv683,http://variety.com/2018/film/news/bright-sequel-netflix-1202651949/,5779,1514991859.0,,"Didn't they order a sequel before the film was even released.&&Brighter&&from [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bright-sequel-will-smith-david-ayer-expected-return-netflix-movie-1071188)
> One key player that will not be returning for round two is writer Max Landis, who was paid a reported $3 million to $4 million for his screenplay in 2016 when the project ignited a bidding war before ultimately selling to Netflix.        &&> The film was written by Max Landis and reportedly cost Netflix $3.5 million.

I thought Netflix paid more than that to get the rights to distribute.&&Cool, the universe in the movie has a lot of potential. Hopefully the writing will be better &&> Netflix touted “Bright” as the highest-viewed original film ever on the service in its launch week

Daaamn, son.&&I want more awkward shootouts!&&I think Netflix is on to the fact that people like B-movies but Hollywood isn’t supplying them.&&I hope this gets turned into a series eventually, and they go full [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun).&&Just watched it last night.  I thought the first and second acts really laid out an interesting world and was eagerly awaiting the finale. However, I think it fell apart trying to make too much happen in the last 20 minutes.  

Interested to see how the sequel will expand on the other races.&&I'm glad to hear this. Bright wasn't a cinematic masterpiece by any means, but I was fully entertained the whole time. I will definitely watch the sequel and be excited for it. I don't want every movie to be inspiring or thought provoking. Sometimes you just want some dumb shit that looks good &&It has potential but they really need better dialogue than what we got. Visually the movie was pretty rad. It looked like the first wand victim was Jenova from FF7.

What would please me is they could actually have dialogue without using like terms as 
""SHUT UP AND LET ME TALK"".
""ARE YOU DONE TALKING?""
""SHUT UP AND LET ME TALK.""
Cause that was pretty much the only way to get passed exposition. Laaaazy writing. 
&&Can we get the damn dwarves you mentioned this time!?!?! And some better writing?


Also can we get more action from the Orcs in combat?!?! You played up their strength the whole movie but every battle envolving an orc was pretty lack luster and I got no sense of their strength.

Also, work on your Elvin acrobat fighting scenes please. Ive seen 70's kung fu movies with better flipping acrobatic action that this shit.


Edit: I realize ""they"" wont read this but I feel better directing my complaints to them instead of at them.&&I started watching this with my wife, last night (couldn't finish, as the baby kept waking up...)

My wife, who isn't really into fantasy or D&D stuff all that much said, ""I really like this. I wish it were a series...""

So, yeah, it's pretty cool this was announced, today.&&Needs to be a TV series instead of a film.&&Excited to see more of this world.&&I just watched Bright. It was predictable, cheesy, and *absolutely fucking great.*&&Please hire a good writer this time. &&I know the world building aspect has already turned into a circlejerk but I would like to see more of everyday life in a world like this. I think a short season companion TV show would work really well.&&It was fairly entertaining - but I don't see how they could greenlight a sequel with another $90m budget.&&Too Bright?&&That didn't take long.&&The dialogue, especially in the beginning, was cringey. However I loved the movie. I also loved how they incorporated JRE in the beginning.&&Bright should be a series, not a movie. &&i feel like it could've been executed alot better&&honestly wasn't all that impressed by the movie.&&Dialogue was pretty poop. Will Smith did will smith things. 6/10 would watch sequel as background noise while I'm doing something else. &&Kind of wish the series would continue as an anthology&&I find it interesting  that they reference ""Alien Nation"", where the film more closely resembles the old FASA RPG ""Shadowrun.""  I wonder if they bothered to get FASA rights or if they even know about them. I wonder where the IP rights for Shadowrun landed after FASA folded. &&I knew it, I know that this project drew a crowd, Netflix must have all the data to support my intuition. I hope they develop it and craft it a bit more polished but the mixing of worlds is a fantastic idea. And the fairies throwing shit is the icing.&&Announced on Dec. 20th.


http://collider.com/bright-2-netflix-will-smith/&&Pretty much all of Netflix's properties get an immediate two season order as long as they perform well. It's only recently that things like Death Note and Amy Schumers special bombed so hard that Netflix exexs rethought their two picture deal&&2 Bright 2 Dark&&Bright Boys 2&&B Right Back&&Bright 2: Shine Bright like a Diamond

The idea is nice but his script was tosh.&&i believe the $3.5M was just for the script.&&Following After Earth, I just assume that the only modern way to make a Will Smith movie is to spend nothing on the script and eight billion dollars on marketing. &&They edited to 90 million.&&Absolutely, I was so invested in the Characters because it's so Odd, all these fantasy monsters we know co-existing (there's even a dragon). Hopefully next time it's less about being cops and more about the whole mythos.&&Maybe it'll get a TV series. &&I agree 100%. My buddy and I watched and agreed we love the universe, just hated the writing &&reminds me of shadowrun though&&I actually want an X-files like tv show set in this universe. With that elf and big ginger guy traveling around the us finding brights and fighting off dragons and what not. &&[deleted]&&It’s a Will Smith movie released on a platform you’re already paying for. No reason not to at least check it out. It also has good word of mouth.

And another way to look at it, you can afford a month of Netflix for less than a single ticket to a movie theater, or the cost of 1.5 digital rentals, so even if you only cared about seeing Smith you get a great deal as you also get access to a month of Netflix content.

(As an aside, this is why $6 digital rentals are idiotic. The value isn’t there. They should be $1-2, tops. It’s our bandwidth and our equipment, and you’re up against services that provide hundreds of hours for significantly less overall.)&&[deleted]&&Not surprising, the movie was weirdly good. It had horrible pacing though. It’s hard to introduce a fantasy type universe in just a single movie. There was just a lot going on&&I want more lines like “I don’t wanna die in a titty bar shootout”&&It was very reminiscent of the Bad Boys II shootout against the Rasta gangster. &&""we were doing so great...""&&How are your holes?&&The Happening was so bashed but damn I love a good B-movie like that. I think the problem was they didn't market it as such. Reminded me a lot of Maximum Overdrive which is one of my all time favs.&&Bright, Beasts of No Nation, Blame!, Barry, iBoy. i think you're on to something with this B-movie idea...&&If you actually watch the announcement, at the end he mentions Shadowrun.&&I mean shit they gave altered carbon a 7 mil an epsiode budget &&Yess!!! I'm glad I wasn't the only one getting total Shadowrun vibes!&&for anyone interested in the universe, i recommend the CRPG series on steam or gog.com: 

http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/532/Shadowrun_Complete_Collection/

the whole series is on sale right now during the winter steam sale. (86% off - 9,55€). if anything, take a look at [Dragonfall](http://store.steampowered.com/app/300550/Shadowrun_Dragonfall__Directors_Cut/) (2,99€), arguably the best in the series. you don't need the previous game to understand the story. they're all independent of one another.&&I'm hoping the nine armies they kept referencing means there are nine distinct races they can play with. 

We know humans, elves, dwarves, and orcs.  That's only four. Who are the other five?  There are so many possibilities. At least one is probably lizardmen or argonians (there's a picture of one on a crosswalk sign in the movies.) What else? Giants, trolls, tieflings?  I need to know. Its all I could think about after I watched the movie.&&Can relate. Story of my ex.&&This is the best way to sum up how I feel about movies. &&I immediately thought Jenova when I saw that as well. &&I really did enjoy the conversation with the neighbors though. “Don’t worry just tryina sell me house. Keep up the gangster shit.” Something along those lines lol

Edit: Meant to say “My” house but I’m keeping it.&&Considering the situation, i could see the dialogue being what it was if that situation was actually happening. I was fine with it as a result &&I think those lines were used to help establish just how much of an underclass orcs are. They are purposefully disrespectful. &&Those Elves are super fast and dangerous until they aren't in the last act. &&Running away...flips off of a box for no reason&&[deleted]&&I want to say the FBI magic elfs partner was a dwarf.&&> Can we get the damn dwarves

In the scene where everyone was bitching at each other in the PD locker room there was a cop getting dressed in the background who was about 3.5 feet tall... &&To me, the whole thing felt like a movie-length pilot, and I want to watch that series. 

So much world building, and establishing the setting, and so much of it goes nowhere. If there was a series to back it up, that stuff's not wasted time. 

The Dark Lord? Mentioned, the whole story revolves around evading and then stopping his minion, but we hear nothing of substance. 

The Orkish clan stuff gets hinted at, but we never find out what it means to be blooded, except that it's a desirable thing. 

Jarik the orc is shown in graffiti in the credits, then Jacoby gives us one line about him, but we're not in the world long enough for it to pay off in any way. 

The whole movie is a bunch of Chekov's Guns that just stay on the mantle. &&But then you'd have to drop Will Smith. No way they could afford him for a whole series. &&Agreed. Wouldn't be surprised if we get to see 'the Dark Lord' this time, just hope that it doesn't take away too much from the gritty L.A. setting which really worked in the first film in my opinion&&You should check out Shadow Run. It’s basically Cyber Punk Dungeons and Dragons, but it’s very similar (if not the inspiration for this film).&&They did, then they brought in Ayer who proceeded to fuck up the entire script with ham-fisted rewrites. [Here is the original.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8f8GCZAhRX_WVBGXy1XSkdJZ1U/view)&&[deleted]&&Reportedly 11m people already watched it. These figures may actually be understated as it is Nielsen that is guessing at that number. 10$ per month subscription. Netflix owns it and doesnt need to pay out residuals. It's pretty easy math.&&JRE?

Or

Java Runtime Environment &&This has been a thing with me before, but we have GOT to stop using acronyms and assuming everyone knows them.&&Totally agree but I don't see will Smith committing to a series honestly. &&It's funny I loved this movie but boy does it have issues, I think I'm just so desperate for some urban fantasy that actually has some budget that I'll like anything that comes close. &&Unpopular opinion in this thread, but I thought it was terrible &&The writing was bad, like terrible bad. The story was average. The visuals were pretty good, but the 'world' it inhabited was intensely cringeworthy (orc cholos... really?), and the acting was pretty mediocre.

Why does reddit adore this movie so much? Is it just because they love the idea of it more than they actually enjoyed the movie? This movie kind of feels like Reddits fantasy movie and I think a lot of people genuinely cannot accept just how bad it was, or are deluding themselves. Its become a circlejerk that ""the movie is way better than the critics said!"" and I feel like its a self fulfilling prophecy to agree with that even if you would have thought the movie was terrible if you never heard anything about the critics or anything. 

It genuinely frustrates me how much Reddit can sort of convince themselves of this type of shit. I've done the same shit to myself so I know how much preconceived notions can change someones opinion. The movie deserved the 3/10 it got. It was really that fucking bad. &&So OPs title is technically right?&&2 Bright 2 Luminous &&[deleted]&&Bright 2: Extended Lumens Edition&&They don't do numerical sequels in titles anymore. It's...

In his version, there was no 'save the world' stuff.&&Apparently the script was entirely rewritten after they bought it. Only one line from the original script was in the final film.&&Oh ok, thank you, [I found the article about it.](http://collider.com/netflix-bright-deal-will-smith-david-ayer-movie/)

> According to Deadline, $3 million alone goes to screenwriter Max Landis (American Ultra), which is one of the largest spec deals for a writer in years. “The film will cost around $45M to shoot, meaning that just about that much will be invested in talent fees, and also to buy out their back ends,” reports Deadline. As for how the film will be distributed, “there could be a limited theatrical launch day and date, Netflix is doing this to serve subscribers to its streaming service in countries around the world and so there will be no backend residuals.”&&And apparently there is only one line left from the original script that was sold.&&Will Smith probably doesn't get out of bed for less than eight figures.&&... I dont want to come off as a hater... but 3.5 million for THAT script?&&That’s $3.5M of the word fuck right there&&[deleted]&&After Earth was marketed? I had never seen anything about it, just randomly saw it streaming&&I kind of liked how the mythos wasn't really explained. Often the answers to questions aren't as great as we'd like. Explaining the mythos gives them more chances to screw up. 

I hope we learn a bit more about everything while still maintaining the mystery of how it all fits together. &&[deleted]&&Disagree. We already have plenty of fantasy movies. I want to see more issues dealing with the practical side of live among all the different races.&&I thought the movie felt like a TV pilot, not a normal movie. They dropped a lot of worldbuilding into it that would be kind of pointless without more installments. There is a lot to flesh out, to the point where if they *don't* flesh it out then it was pointless to include in the first movie. Also, I felt like the villains in Bright were completely generic/forgettable, so it definitely felt like a deliberate lead-up to the ""Real Villain"" dark lord. Lastly, Will Smith didn't realize he was a bright to the very end, and on the whole that fact didn't contribute too much to the story of the first movie, but would imply a lot of things for a sequel.

I think it could be less of a standard US TV series and more of a mini-series of two hour installments, like they do with Sherlock or something. &&The world would work so much better in a TV series imo. I guess that would have been a more expensive risk that Netflix wasn't willing to initially take though.&&Bright boys bright boys, watcha gonna do, watcha gonna do when they come for you.

*BRIGHT is filmed on location of the men and women of law enforcement. All orcs are proven guilty until proven innocent in a court of law.* &&My only issue with the world building was how fucking retarded they made the orcs attire... Like give them their own cultural identify instead of making them into cholos wearing orc makeup.

&&I was confused. They pumped it full of comedic moments but we didn't get to see Will Smith be lighthearted like Men in Black or Independence Day, he was just an asshole the entire time. &&It doesn't remind me of it, it IS it. I don't feel like I see this enough. I don't mind, I just wish people appreciated the source material more.&&That's a really cool idea! And now I want that too!&&But rentals cost $6 in 1999 when you had to drive to a store (that had rent), pick up a physical copy (that costs money to manufacture) and interact with a employee (that had to be paid)... Of course is should cost the same.  

I can't believe they haven't lowered the cost to rent, I would probably spend $10-$20 a month on rentals at $2 a pop instead of $0 currently... I bet that's true for a lot of people.&&They also released ""Beasts of No Nation"" and ""Okja"" which were great films with low-ish budgets.&&Don't Adam Sandler movies get crazy numbers? I think that *is* an impressive feat. There's also stuff like Okja.&&I enjoyed Sandy Wexler.&&[deleted]&&For me the pacing was off due to the dialog and sountrack being off at times. I don't really buy into not being able to set up the fantasy world of common fantasy creatures living with humans. 

I will admit that I've seen Death Valley (would recommend) which is based on an almost identical concept so it was easier for me to get into.&&Yeah it's crazy. I watched the first half one night, then turned it off (when they're hiding in the basement with the elf girl)because it felt like it had gone no where. Then the next night I watch the second-half and it's the bat-shit survive-the-night action movie. 

I'm excited for the sequel, though.&&We gonna titty bar gunfight die. &&What about ""Fairy lives don't matter today.""?

Pure gold. &&""its like a nuclear weapon that grants wishes""&&Well Bright was the best Bad Boys movie in years. &&*THE DEVIL IS NAWT WELCOME HEEEEAAA*&&Which one? The street one wasn't great but I really enjoyed the inside the house one. &&Ive been dying for a Fantasy Races in Modern Times/SciFi setting that wasnt Shadowrun. I needed more than just Shadowrun, why aren't there more IPs like this?&&there are other races seen in the movie. but the answer is: Giants, Ogres, Goblins, Panahu, Brezzik, Centaur.&&There was a centaur in the background of one scene &&There were dragons in the distance of one shot over the city.&&That was the best ""my ex"" joke I've ever seen&&this. I just want to turn my brain off for 2 hours and enjoy a nice popcorn flick. This is what Bright gave me and I enjoyed it immensely. &&you mean you don't want every film to be like 'mother!'?&&Now I'm picturing Will Smith with an Irish accent.&&Clearly they nova'ed the first few encounters. By the time they fought the main characters they ran out of mana/spellslots/energy/pp. Typical rookie mistake...&&Also the when the orcs are beating will smith, his face aint caving in.&&Lol also that. Dismantling a whole swat team like flies. Then suddenly they are worthless. But honestly I can accept that a bit more considering how frequent of an oversight that is in Hollywood. But those acrobatics were soooooo cringe. Might as well have just shown us the support cables with yellow flags that say ""For the safety of our actors, maneuver slowly and unrealistically.""

I guess they didn't want to get stunt doubles to do that shit convincingly??&&You know what? I'm glad I don't live in a world where a reason is needed to flip myself off a box.&&To be fair, just 'cause you can bench press a ton doesn't mean you actually weigh a ton. &&It isn't that outlandish, for example an orangutan weighs about as much as a person and is ~7 times as strong. They could lift a truck but would still get totally fucked and/or die if they were hit by one.&&Lifting a standing vehicle is easy different than one with momentum. &&Scrolled through here to find exactly this comment, definitely feels like a long pilot.

I wouldn't be surprised if the new sequel was really a mini series, or at least it definitely should be. There's too much here. &&I'm okay with that. His humor is outdated. &&Holy shit - just 15 minutes/pages in and it's fundamentally better. The human protagonist has actual, relatable goals/obstacles and isn't a huge fucking asshole to his partner. They actually seem like partners.

It sucks that one of the people he dedicated the story to was Ayer, then Ayer just completely fucked the story.&&This needs to be more recognized. The shitty writing was not Landis's fault. If you want an idea of how he can write, check out Dirk Gently.&&[deleted]&&Well that explains a *lot*.&&Plus you have Disney + Hulu looming on the horizon. &&True. They market it and it’s $10/ticket basically. You get Netflix watch it. Forget you have Netflix for a few months. You might even keep it willingly &&Well I know it has been watched in my household at least five times. Wife and I enjoyed it once, then the kids and myself. Then the kids I know of three more times. &&> Java Runtime Environment

Edit: Woah, only a couple pages in and things are pretty different so far. Like, it starts almost identically, except Ward (Alvins) and his wife are broken up, his daughter isn't his... Shit like that. Definitely has a darker vibe.&&> For JRR Tolkien and David Ayer, who bring worlds to life.

If you look really closely, you can see the exact moment his heart broke in half!&&I can't stand Ayers. He does the same old ghetto/cholo shit.

He had that one good movie, Training day, and since then have been ripping it off. &&Yes.

Ayer sucks not Landis.&&Who would have guess Ayer could ruin a movie that could have been ok or even good uh&&The magic want plot was interesting, but [wow was it disappointing when Will Smith was the one in a million that could use a wand. Like, they said that elves and humans could be brights, and I was ready for the orc to be the first Orc Bright. But no, it's the Human.](#spoiler)&&Anyone have a TL;DR of the main plot differences between the original and the rewrite?&&That explains a lot. Like why Tiika turned out to be Noomi Rapace's sister, for no apparent reason.&&But was the dialogue just as bad?&&It sounds like the team responsible for rewriting Bright are the same people that rewrote (and IMO totally ballsed up) the ending of I Am Legend.  
  
The penultimate scene [where Kandomere and Montehugh visit Ward and Jakoby in the hospital, and Jakoby acts like an arse until he finally 'gets it', shuts up, and goes along with what we deduce will be the *official* story](#spoiler) added nothing to the plot.  
  
It was already established during their phone conversation that Kandomere had the power to make everything alright.  
  
IMO they could have cut out that penultimate scene entirely, and gone straight from [Ward and Jakoby laying outside the burning building to the Hero/medals scene, and after the medals are hung around their necks](#spoiler), the camera could have panned out into the crowd where we'd see Kandomere and Montehugh, we'd see Ward noticing them in the crowd, we'd see Kandomere and Ward exchange a look, Ward gives Kandomere a subtle nod and, apparently satisfied, Kandomere turns and walks away.&&Eh, I read through it and there are a few lines common to both movies. Mostly the trailer and exposition stuff.&&Do you know what the line was? &&>  to buy out their back ends

Didnt know it was that kind of movie.&&> Max Landis

Wait, is that the guy that made the Death of Superman video on Youtube?&&This is gonna be huge for writers in Hollywood not getting paid what they deserve. They're going to see Netflix shelling out money to deserving writers and they are all going to go there. Good for them.&&Oh? How exactly? &&you'd think that about a lot of the big names in hollywood but apparently all of the first order troopers that weren't CGI in the last two star wars movies are all A-listers and other bigger celebrity figures(including both of the younger princes of the house of Windsor) working for scale and no credit just to be in star wars.&&I enjoyed the movie and it was a super interesting premise, but 3.5 million seems crazy for any original script (as in, not tied to a franchise). Especially because this one boiled down to a standard buddy cop movie at its core.&&$3.5MM for the concept mostly. I mean, it worked. You don’t hear about a Death Note 2 sequel by Netflix. The writer comes off as more charismatic than most writers, which helps in pitches. &&Shyamalan has redeemed himself in my eyes with Split. But hopefully he can continue on that momentum.&&They even made a Civilization game based on it&&I normally hate when explanations  are left open like that but it felt right in this movie. It kind of added to the ""this is just how things are"" realism of the plot.&&This.

I believe that I'm in the minority with regards to this, but I really appreciated the fact that they stuck to the story and didn't spend too much time worldbuilding.

They established enough of the world to tell the story.  It wasn't spoonfed to the audience through a montage or other means.

I hope the sequel continues this trend.&&You see one flying through the sky in the background of a shot of the city.&&It was one scene where it is seen flying off in the distance. If you looked away for a second it would be easy to miss.&&52 minutes in, it's a nighttime shot. The dragon is in the top right corner. 

Here is a screenshot from another thread.  https://imgur.com/a/HyQMp&&Flying in the sky in a scene of the cityscape. &&I really wanted to know more about the dragon! Is it just some sort of wildlife like a bird, or is it more intelligent like Smaug from Lord of the rings or the dragons from skyrim &&If anything I liked the police and action aspect of the movie.&&Yeah but seeing more fantastical stuff, or more creatures in this world wouldn’t be a bad thing&&I want to see The Office....but in this universe. &&If could be that without having to be a cop movie/show. That could be the common thread among all sorts of characters and plot lines.&&Agreed, Personally I'd love to see more backstory! Jakoby's struggles getting to where he's at, growing up in the projects or all the shit he had to put up with at the academy. I also feel like there's more to Ward and Rodriguez's friendship, which I'd love to see!&&I agree.  I'm actually surprised to learn that Bright was originally conceived as a movie.  It felt like a ~~TV~~ series pilot that didn't do well with early test audiences so the producers re-edited it into a standalone movie.  It has a lot of potential as a ""Lethal Weapon meets Lord of the Rings"" Netflix series.

> Netflix touted “Bright” as the highest-viewed original film ever on the service in its launch week

Hmm.  Based on this, it might happen.&&Wasn’t there a line somewhere that Orcs were football stars? It would make sense they’d dress in football jerseys as a sense of pride within their race. &&There was a sign that this could change.  [The Big Orc, whatever his name was, gave his speech about how LA was different from much of the rest of the US, and therefore likely the world.](#spoiler)

Orc's as an underclass is obviously a theme, but I think the particulars  of Orc culture are likely much more complex than what we saw in just this one movie.

Effectively, the only Orcs we saw were gang members.  Doesn't mean all orc are right?&&Haha and here this whole time I thought they were Juggalos!&&pretty sure the movie was attempting to make a political statement in this matter&&""Let's titty bar gunfight die"" &&That's exactly how his character is in iRobot too, which I personally like. Not everyone is lighthearted. Making everyone quippy with jokes and laughs cheapens the truly happy moments in the movie. &&Bitch he jus took a shotgun to the chest a few days before the movie took place, how funny do u expect him to be through out the story &&That's the entire point, yeah he says some funny shit but he's a dick, hence the sergeant telling him that no one wants to ride with him &&Smith’s character being a dick bothered me too, but I think that was on purpose. Smith’s boss said that the reason he was partnered up with the orc was because no one else wanted to be his partner.&&And the whole time the orc was like

> How come he don’t want me man&&Its a very early Shadowrun world.  Magic is also much more prevalent in Shadowrun and things are extremely futuristic.  It definitely takes a few things from Shadowrun but it most certainly is not Sadowrun.&&What I hate is how movies are digitally released to buy, but then you have to wait for like more than a month to rent it.  I keep seeing IT as available, and I click on it, and it's $21, same with Blade Runner, they have both been available to buy for a while, but won't be rentable for like another month.  It just makes me want to pirate them.

I am willing to pay the $6 to rent these movies, but I can't for another month.  Pretty dumb.&&It may have been 6$ for a new release, but I could easily rent older movies for 1$ a piece at most rental stores.&&Saddens me they weren't seen so much.  Beasts was incredible, and Okja was...Heartfelt.&&But they were hardly hugely marketable blockbusters, they had very specific audiences.&&Mudbound was an incredibly powerful enticing movie &&Bet line of the movie &&""Tell this motherfucker to get his big green Shrek-lookin' ass outta my face and back home 'fore I get all in his shit.

*all the orcs nod*&&They should throw Martin Lawrence in there as an elf in the next movie. &&The house one of course&&Hopefully we will get that due to the success of Bright (no thanks to the critics.)&&Did some more digging after your comment.  Looks very promising.  

One question though.  What exactly is a Panahu?&&There were several in the movie. One was a cop, serving as a mounted police officer but he was both the man and the horse. It was really cool IMO.&&>It's like you're dead but you're eating popcorn.

Stamina, Elves generally have low Constitution, whereas Humans and Orcs have plenty. They would be fatigued by the end of the night given they had just previously fucked up at least 50 other people mostly by hand.&&They were probably holding back, they didnt want to kill him yet.&&It's the same in video games.  

Boss is introduced by destroying whole cities with a snap of their fingers, but shows none of that power against the hero.&&Just because you shot Jesse James, don't make you Jesse James.&&No, but if you can deadlift a truck you should probably be able to take a punch from someone who can’t and do some damage with your unarmed melee attack. &&And sadly, vice versa.&&Wow.. Just reading the first few pages tells a different story. Why do they do this? Idk, I'll read the whole thing and then decide but it seems like changes to scripts always make them more digestible, to the point of mush. It's sad&&I'm WILDLY AWARE&&###tl;dr: Landis' script had none of the cheap 'orcs are just black people in football jerseys' moments or dumb, low-hanging fruit jokes. The cops have a legit relationship as partners, and are upfront with each other - there's no artificial suspense of 'did he let the orc go?' or sudden reveal of the orc, because he straight up tells his partner when his partner asks. Instead of elf assassins and some chick stuck to a wall, there's a legit, scary-ass witch and a cult trying to bring her back. Ward is not a Bright. There is no IA investigation, he just wants to provide for his daughter and have a career. The dirty cops involve a hit squad, and the FBI guys actually do detective work and help forward the plot. There's no random strip club shootouts or over the top homie-speak. There's no 'chosen one' - the idea of a prophecy is a metaphor. This is a straight cop drama/conspiracy thriller, and it's great.

* Ward's name is Alvins, no mention made of his ethnicity (until later - he's white, but doesn't matter). His neighbors are latino, but the fairy thing is mostly the same.

* His living situation is unclear as to whether it's a divorce situation (if they were even married), but his wife is much more hostile toward him and is struggling to find a new job. She has a date tonight and her daughter (Jakoby mentions 'she's not your kid') is staying at her grandmother's tonight.

* Jakoby comes to pick up Alvins/Ward, and Alvins gets mad at him because orcs aren't supposed to be driving and he popped the tire up on the curb when he tried to pull up to the house. Jakoby says he drives fine, and Alvins remains concerned whether someone would notice (we don't know about the investigation at this point, but that's likely why).

* The 'hey rockstar' scene between Jakoby and the daughter is the same, as is the car ride with the exception Alvins isn't a huge fucking asshole to his long-term partner for no reason.

* Racist cops in the locker room scene is a little shorter, but has the same beats. 

* The briefing talks about 'it's gonna be hot today, we're stretched thin and backup is scarce, be careful.' The chief asks for Alvins and Jakoby to recount the events that culminated in the orc kid getting away, and we hear about the 10ft fire escape here. Instead of Ward getting shot while Jakoby gets a burrito, the kid has a gun and Alvins and Jakoby pursue on foot until Alvins rolls his ankle and Jakoby is eluded. 

* The chief dismisses Jakoby and tells Alvins that the investigation could get him fired and he'll more than likely be out of consideration for making detective, giving Alvins actual stakes and goals for his personal arc because he not only wants to support the kid (even though he says 'it's not about that'), but he wants to actually feel a sense of progress and meaning in his life. Chief tells him to think about whether Jakoby could be lying and his career may depend on that.

* The ride-along bit is more interesting because the partners actually feel like partners and joke with one another. There's no harsh animosity or threatening aggressiveness - they're hanging out, doing their jobs, and enjoying each other's company while on patrol. Also, there's no forced 'Will Smith punking orcs like he just watched The Wire and thinks all cops do this' - it seems a lot more nuanced and everyday.

~~I can update this with further differences/notable points as I read through the day, if anybody is interested.~~

#EDIT 1: Through the invisible wall scene

* The bearded dude is just on top of a roof yelling and ranting and looks emaciated rather than a hobo swordsman. Ramirez is still there, but they joke about the guy on the roof. There's no drawn-out scene in the middle of an intersection, nor any arrest - they just pull up, talk to Ramirez, joke about the Dark Lord, then leave for another dispatch call.

* Oh, right - the feds come out and are looking for something, but they are only there for like 30 seconds and the scene changes. There's no 'hello Will Smith we are IA and want you to fuck your partner because this is how IA actually works.'

* This goes right to the 'spotter' scene before they find the wand. Much more direct and finely edited in terms of pacing, I think. The shootout happens just as quickly as it did, and Jakoby is just as rattled - one difference is it's late afternoon instead of 'dramatic night firefight,' but that's purely stylistic.

* The house seems a lot more damaged and blown out - people are blown in half and disintegrated with entire walls being torn open. Going through to find the shooter, then finding the Bright is more or less the same. There's no 'elf lady hooked up to the wall and bleeding' at all.

* The wand seems a lot more traditional than the glowing stone thing we got - purely stylistic, I think. The elf girl doesn't give them the impression she's a Bright because the wand just goes off, and the lookout kid runs to tell his gang what happened.

* The cops arrive and discuss what just happened in the same way, but the dialogue seems a bit tighter and less rambling than how it was delivered. They decide to take the wand and to kill the elf girl so that there's no witnesses, assuming Alvins will fall into line to further his career and have support during the investigation. Not only that, but they've arranged a hit on the elf girl and Jakoby (who is outside comforting the elf girl, as in the movie) to make it looks like an 'accident.' I feel like that's actually really important, because it presents even higher stakes than 'hey dude go kill your orc partner cause we said,' especially because we have established Alvins and Jakoby are friends.

* There's a funny line during the 'will Alvins betray Jakoby' scene where one of the bad cops tells him he's living in a 'fuckin fantasy land.' Not bad, Max Landis.

* The 'tell me you fucking lied' scene between Alvins and Jakoby stays pretty much the same, but then Landis removes so much unnecessary drama from the rest of the story by having Jakoby not only admit to letting the kid go, but telling Alvins that it was the wrong kid and explaining the whole situation in their argument as the corrupt cops look on from a distance. Not only that, but Jakoby explains that following the robbery, Alvins chased the wrong orc kid wearing red out of the shop and Jakoby found out but tried to cover for his partner because he knew he was on thin ice and trying to make detective. Instead of orc cop just trying to make his partner like him and be buddies, there's a real partnership with give and take and sacrifices. Wow.

* There's no slow-mo Britpop shootout - it's literally bang-bang, John Wick style shooting that happens ""so quick you can't catch your breath,"" in Landis' words. Jakoby still is justifiably upset and apprehends Alvins, checks on the cops, then tries to call it in as the gang (only seven guys in the script) approaches.

* The gang's leader isn't named ""Poison"" like an anime character, his name is Salinas and ""his voice is... dripping with poison."" He's not in a wheelchair, which isn't important, but he also doesn't have ""only God can judge me"" tattooed on his face like David Ayer apparently really likes to do with his antagonists, which is important.

* The gang surrounding the car looking for the wand plays out normally, as does the escape, but now we have a precedent for Jakoby being a bad driver and he swerves around in a way that makes sense before the wand floats and they hit that wall thing.

More updates coming, I don't have much to do at work today haha

&&I'm only a quarter of the way through the script, but what stands out to me the most is that the two leads feel more like people with lives outside of the movie.

https://youtu.be/PRRoAZcwQMY&&Not really a spoiler.  I thought it was pretty obvious after they arrested the dirty hairy guy swinging a claymore around in the street. He was speaking orkish to his partner and the hobo specifically told him that ‘his partner/human was blessed’. 

That same guy said humans can be brights but only one in a million chance of that happening.

Here is my main gripe with Bright that you just made me remember: [When Jakoby let's the Orc in the alley go, and then it turns out it's the same Orc with the gun to Jakoby's head later... they did nothing with that. I thought it was going to be this big reveal but no, it's just like ""this guy saved my life, I can't kill him"" and then the dads just like ""well then leave, I'll do it"" and it DIDN'T FUCKING MATTER AT ALL.

He also wrote “Superman:American Alien” which is a really fun read.&&Yeah, and the Dirk Gently show. And the ass slap video. &&He also wrote the movie [Chronicle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/).&&David Ayer rewrote it pretty heavily to sound more authentic to his style. Then when Will Smith was hired it was heavily rewritten to sound more authentic to his style. This also seems to have included rewriting Joel Edgerton's character to have more humor to match Will Smith's character having more humor.

You can actually track down Max Landis' original screenplay and David Ayers' rewrite online.&&Ya, but that's a different story.  Star Wars is a hugely popular property that a ton of people would want to be in.  Bright was a new IP and the callback to Will Smith's previous work was part of the film's advertising strategy.&&Well, using Star Wars as an example of normalcy in Hollywood isn’t really a great touchstone &&It's not the buddy cop movie, but the potential for world building.  You can have tons of stories in this type of universe, so for Netflix it's a potential massive franchise. &&I doubt the script started that way. My guess is that it started out with a lot more exploration of the very interesting world but ended up as a buddy cop movie with an endless string of improbable action scenes because that's what pulls in the big audience (or so standard Hollywood thinking goes). &&True, but instead of a white guy/black buddy cop, it was black guy/fantasy creature - whole new level!!&&The visit was solid as well&&For those not in the know, [Civilization: Beyond Earth](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Civilization:_Beyond_Earth) and Will Smith was in [After Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Earth). Having explained the joke, I will go back to lurking.
&&There was also a centaur.

Hopefully they were intended as nods to a larger universe for sequels and its not just going to be cop movies with orcs.&&Yeah, I mean, at it's core it was a buddy cop movie. Not a fantasy movie. You try to shoehorn the fantasy aspect of it too hard and you end up with bland nonsense.&&Right but it doesn’t all have to be “find the magic object” fantasy tropes&&I think the only reason this isn't a TV show is the price tag on Will Smith. Maybe if Jaden keeps making awful movies, Netflix will get the leverage they need to get him for a series.&&> Orcs were football stars

Specifically defensive line, but skill positions were still humans.&&Yeah, there was a line about lots of Orcs being in the NFL, but none in the NBA. &&I really think the encounter with Dorghu was the best worldbuilding scene in the whole movie.  You get a little bit of outside perspective that the whole world isn't this racist shithole, it's LA specifically. The scene also very satisfactorily plays off the trope that organized crime heads start as community leaders in environments where the establishment has failed their people. &&We saw an Orc chauffeur and plenty of orc menial laborers in the background.&&Didn't they mention the orc community in Miami was better?&&> Effectively, the only Orcs we saw were gang members. Doesn't mean all orc are right?

Not gangs, clans.  Orcs society is based on tribalism.  In the movie, they often refer to being a member of a clan as being ""blooded.""

For an individual orc to have any place in orc society, they must be a member of a clan.  It goes beyond gangs.  You simply are not an real orc if you are not in a clan.&&Hahahaha pretty much. What is up with this Ayer guy and his hardon for Latino gangsters? Its a terrible asethetic... Fucking ruined the Joker with that shit too.

I'm relieved that Landis isn't responsible for what we saw since I loved Dirk Gently (despite it's divergence from the source material) and from it formed the impression that Landis was quite an inspired and talented writer, which made Bright quite a disappointment in at least a couple of ways.&&#Through the party scene

* The feds get wind of the wand situation and seem to recognize the house where everything went down as 'the house,' and they spring into action.

* Pollard, the Ike Berenoltz character, survived and is leaning on a wall when some three-person strike team with normal-sounding names (e.g. Gibson is the leader) show up, not the elf assassin super squad. They know each other, and it seems that these are the people that were coming to clean up and set the scene for Jakoby's assassination. Pollard tells them they got away and have the wand, and once they get all the information he has, they shoot him with Alvins' gun (which was left on-scene earlier, I guess).

* Gibson interviews some elderly neighbors, who identify Alvins as a white dude (obviously doesn't matter to the story, but it's a difference, so there you go) and describe what they saw happen from their window. Gibson asks if anybody else is home that may have seen, but they say their grandson is elsewhere and she shoots them both in the head and Landis explains that yeah, that's not a cop. Easy way to show who the bad guys are without having five or six moving parts making up the antagonists, I think.

* Instead of all the bodies (of fucking *cops*, as well) just laying out in the street, the strike team is actually cleaning the scene and removing the bodies to avoid suspicion before moving out to hunt for our cop protagonists. Simple attention to detail, but it adds a lot to the atmosphere, I think. Also, at some point somebody says something like 'this blood smells like gasoline' - but we don't see who's. This comes back later.

* The gang find the cruiser wrecked after hitting the invisible wall and fire on it, only to find it empty. They talk among themselves and reiterate to the audience that the cops are stretched thin, otherwise they would have beaten the gang to this wrecked cruiser, and call in reinforcements.

* Tikka and the cops are still hiding just out of sight and watching that go down, but Alvins is still handcuffed at this point (I think that's different from the film, but at this point in watching the movie I was already mostly checked out, so...).

* Jakoby has the wand tucked into his belt, and it seems like there's no 'if you touch this, you will die' bullshit going on. Not that that was a good or bad thing in the movie, necessarily, but Landis is clearly treating the wand as a magical gun that can 'just go off' instead of a WMD or the Power Stone from Guardians of the Galaxy. Personally, I like that a little more because it's closer to traditional fantasy, but totally subjective.

* They establish more clearly the concept of a binding spell being the reason the car 'hit a wall' at this point, and Jakoby leads them away from the crash scene and the gang while still being wary of Alvins, who keeps trying to help by suggesting what to do. It's clear that Alvins is the vet and is better in combat, compared to Jakoby being a friendlier, puppy-dog type. I like that dynamic a lot, and it did show up a bit in the film.

* Instead of randomly appearing in a different building, Jakoby is leading them down a street because he's not great with tactics and the gang sees them, giving chase. There's also no strip club or whatever at this point - instead, they take refuge in somebody's garage that they break into to get away from the gang.

* Alvins is finally uncuffed at this point and given a gun (I think Jakoby's service weapon, cause he has the shotgun from the cruiser as well), and this is where the 'the lock is outside on the ground' scene happens. Alvins is also way more jacked up from the crash - he's bloodied and woozy.

* The gang leaves and Jakoby asks Alvins for the gun back, who obliges him. They clean Alvins up as he explains what happened. They actually address the elephant in the room, that Alvins came out ready to swing at Jakoby before he killed the crooked cops, and they talk about if Alvins actually thought Jakoby would put orc blood over the law, and they don't spend too much time dwelling on it because there's sort of the whole 'we just shot cops and there's a wand everyone is after' thing going on.

* They decide they can't call the station, and they can't go too far because of the binding spell, and they can't ditch the wand because that's a huge weapon that can do bad shit in the wrong hands. Tikka mentions 'the witch' will be looking for her wand because 'they hurt her, but not enough' as the gang starts to gather outside the garage with weapons drawn. They retreat into the house to find a single mother and her baby, and they try to quiet the baby and get them both out of harm's way as the gang is still forming outside.

* The baby starts crying and won't quiet down, and Alvins pushes the mom and baby to the floor as the gang opens fire on the house. Jakoby breaks through the back door as a gang member rounds the corner, shoots at him, misses, and Jakoby blasts him. It throws him off though, and you can tell he's never really seen combat that close before - again, showing his personality and character a lot better. He snaps out of it and runs with the others.

* They escape down the street with the gang in pursuit, then hear a house party (not a strip club or whatever, again), and make a run for that direction. Alvins gets shot twice in the arm as they run, but they make it to the party to discover it's mostly orcs. The orcs don't react well to the cops showing up, but then bullets hit the porch and it sparks a gunfight between the orcs and the latino gang. 

* They try to slip through the party, but Alvins gets blood on an orc woman, who screams, and other orcs start shoving him around. Jakoby pepper sprays the whole room (covering Tikka's eyes), and they escape through a back door in the resulting chaos, running down another street.

###So far, there's a lot less Bad Boys/Will Smith-isms dialogue and a lot more End of Watch or True Detective vibing going on that I'm really, really enjoying. ~~I'm gonna take a quick break, but this is page 57/105.~~

#EDIT: through the gas station scene

* The strike team + Gibson make it to the scene of the crash, and there's footprints of thick blood, like gasoline (remember from above?). Gibson deems that the bright (the witch Tikka mentioned earlier, I'm guessing) is coming back for the wand and they are no longer the biggest fish in the pond, and that they're going to bide their time and wait for someone to fuck up.

* The feds make it to the house and one of the dick cops from the locker room tries to keep them out, but they flash their FBI 'Magic Division' badges and he crumbles, telling them everything: the bodies inside from the original call are fucked and obliterated by magic, and someone tried to clean up the cop killings, putting them into a squad car but not finishing the job. The elf notices a van across the street and runs to it, discovering that the inside has been blasted apart - it was an FBI surveillance van and the two agents inside are similarly 'magicked the fuck up.' So now it's clear that this house is important and that the FBI isn't just randomly there for the big reveal at the end or whatever.

* The elf FBI guy tells the cop that they were surveilling a cult that wanted to bring the Dark Lord back and kill a bunch of people, and that it was sort of up in the air as to whether it was legit until this wand business started today - now it's all but confirmed. FBI elf steps up and has the 'Rampart-ass shit' line, and shows to be a secondary antagonist as opposed to yet another 'wait is this the bad guy too...?' character. He wants to call in FBI support and goes off to try to make that happen while the cop picks up Pollard's cell phone while on the phone with somebody else to try and get some help - for what, we don't know.

* There's a quick scene of the daughter drawing a picture before bedtime at her grandmother's for Alvins with a message apologizing for being mean to him earlier (like, the 'don't be mean to Jakoby' part) and saying everything will be okay.

* The cops + Tikka are at the gas station now, Alvins and Tikka are tending his wounds while Jakoby deals with a cashier that has never seen an orc in uniform. They called the sheriff from the hobo scene earlier, who is on his way. Jakoby calls back to that hobo and asks if Alvins thinks they could be in a prophecy right now (which seems less fantastic given the setting, so I'll give it that), and Alvins instead asks why Jakoby chose him to be partners. Jakoby tells him he admires Alvins and looks up to him as the ideal for what a police officer should be, 'the good cop,' and sees him as a 'blooded human' like there are blooded orcs - the real deal. See? That's fucking relationship building. Where was all this in the movie? Jakoby apologizes for lying about the orc kid and Alvins just asks that he be in the loop next time.

* The sheriff shows up and holds his gun to them, as in the movie. There's less bickering between Jakoby and Alvins, and they don't play Jakoby to be an idiot showing him the wand when anyone could be dirty - because they're partners and they care about what happens. They calmly explain everything to the sheriff, who then tells his dispatch to cut out the police and call the feds and Department of Magic directly, plus an ambulance. As they continue to handle the scene realistically and try to bargain with the sheriff while the sheriff explains how fucked they are and how bad the situation looks, Gibson pops the sheriff and his chest explodes.
&&Ya, they removed even more world building from the movie that essentially that they weirdly kept in the movie. Jakoby still kinda drives like shit but we have no idea why, Orcs can legally drive in the movie, because we see an Orc lifting a car while another works on it, so Jakoby's lawn driving is sort of ignorantly comedic without letting us know why.&&NullPointerException: The Movie&&The Dark Bright Rises&&Bright Back Mountain&&""Dragons fucking Elves""&&""He is untethered and his rage knows no bounds!""&&I'm a 5 star orc!&&>God damn that's not very Bright

&&Aren't Orcs just fallen Elves in most fantasy?

If this does become a franchise I wouldn’t be surprised to see the orc pick up the wand at some point, most likely to flip the tables and save Will Smith in an equally predictable and dissatisfying twist. &&Yeah idk how people missed this.

&&I see two ways that could explain this

1. To make the viewers believe they'll be freed because of that one act of kindness and then subvert that.

2. It will come back in the next movie&&They are at his medal ceremony. I thought they did okay by the family. Introduce them so the audience knows who they are, mention them throughout the movie without giving them some crappy B plot, pull them back in.

Of course, if I still have Netflix I'll definitely watch the sequel.&&Common consensus I've seen is that this is exactly what we wanted to happen with the family in the plot.

They are present and acknowledged, given cursory character development, then used in a very minor plot point to have Ward call and tell them to leave town with utmost sincerity and urgency.  

Then the family listens and complies.  Baddabing baddaboom, perfect substory.&&But the save the world aspect is merely a backdrop. It's not like during the climax the dark lord is being summoned or anything. You're just hoping the team pulls through somehow.&&Huh.  Now you say it, that shows...&&> deus ex machina

not so much as actually a Chekov's Gun. You were TOLD, repeatedly, so it didn't come from nowhere.&&>  hopefully they can set it up for a wire style series, playing different angles each season and a few movies

This is 100% the right way to go about it. This is way too large of a universe to explore through only a few movies. With it being original screenplay and not based on books (eg LoTR) it'd definitely be more difficult to flesh it out proper across only films, I think.&&Beautiful. Brings a tear to my eye.&&I'm such a fucking idiot that I went on IMDB and looked it up&&John Landis is a fascinating director, he is basically the Rosetta stone of translating Dan Aykroyd's madness into to comprehensive films. With Landis you get Blues Brothers and Trading Places, w/out Landis you get Nothing But Trouble (both literally and the film of the same name).

Not to mention that in 1981 Landis decided to take a break from working with some of the greatest comedic minds of his generation and decided to write/direct An American Werewolf in London which is easily in the top 5 for horror moives that continues to hold up.  &&His mom made most of the iconic clothing for movies like Indiana Jones and Thriller.

It's absolutely fits in the Douglas Adams universe.&&from Max landis' channel on youtube, i get the feeling that numerous script rewrites are pretty common.  especially when u deal with stars like will smith.&&One of the only things I didnt like about the movie was Smith's dialogue, so maybe they should have just went with the one rewrite.&&I have both versions, and have read both, and to say only one line is left intact of Landis's original script is not very accurate. The script did change dramatically, but the bones of Landis's version are still mostly intact. Ayer's rewrites didn't make it much into the final film though his dialogue was much better than Landis's dialogue. &&Will Smith was also a fan and subscriber to World of Warcraft so he may havr been pretty interested in doing a movie with similar characters&&He's probably invested somewhere into netflix movie success&&Yeah I would watch a few episodes of a cops style show set in the universe could hop around to different places and flesh the world out a bit&&[deleted]&&Thank you for your service.&&The centaur just worked so good in that scene, replacing a horse back cop.

They are excluding me from being a customer, and when I can nearly as easily find a pirated copy I have very little incentive to be patient and wait and pay the $6.&&My deal is if you buy a digital copy, you don’t really own it, you own it through a streaming service, and quality can be piss poor. &&I typically don't re-watch movies, or if I do, it's years later, but I do love movies, and I don't mind paying for them when I can.&&I loved Okjia but that shit made me uncomfortable. But I kinda have to give Netflix and the film makers a pat on the back for that.&&[deleted]&&It's a movie about child soldiers so it should leave you depressed, because that shit is actually happening.&&I never said it was good story-telling.  I was just pointing out that the trope appears elsewhere.&&I'm a fan of Landis, and have been since I saw Chronicle - even when he can get a little too defensive of his work (like the aftermath of American Ultra's reception). Reading this script, it comes off a lot like his Death and Return of Superman rant in that it's actually quite inspired and eschews a lot of the cliche beats and tropes that the film ended up tossing back into the movie.

He knows how Hollywood likes to write stories, and he knows what stories has been told before. Instead of giving us Orc Cop + Will Smith (Chosen One) in a modern fantasy setting, he's giving us a legit cop/crime thriller that has magic. The movie is the worst explanation of Shadowrun, whereas the script is that campaign of Shadowrun you played with your friends back in high school that you still look back on fondly. Man, what a difference David Ayer made...&&#Through the orc hideout

* A firefight ensues, and it's shown that Gibson is avoiding security cameras - she starts spraying into the store that they're all hiding in now. It's a neat visual - chips and soda exploding with glass flying while both cops instinctively cover Tikka on the ground to protect her. The clerk stands up from behind the counter with a revolver like he's gonna be the hero and gets popped from behind immediately by another person on the hit squad who is in a sniper position.

* They fall back to a back room of the gas station, running low to avoid being shot at. This is a one-shot/continuous scene, so that would have been really neat to see (if that actually stayed in the movie, blame me for not being engaged, my b). Jakoby is about to head out the back door, but Alvins' vet tactics give him a hunch that there's a flank waiting and he stops him just as they see both 'agents' or whatever they are move to the back room. They run out the front door as the back room gets blasted with bullets.

* As they escape, Jakoby once again twitch fires and kills the third 'agent' dude, who falls on his back bleeding. The other two come back around the building - still avoiding cameras - and stand by his side. He screams for help, but Gibson points out the cameras and tells him to crawl to them instead. He understands and starts crawling, trailing blood.

* They keep running until the binding spell yanks Jakoby and Tikka back, and while they're on the street recovering from getting laid out by magic, two jeeps filled with orcs pull up on them. The orc gang leader is pissed about them fucking up his party and starts beating the shit out of Alvins.

* The feds are still at the house - the elf is looking through the footage trying to figure out what happened while a SWAT van pulls up - that's who the cop called. The FBI guys argue about jurisdiction, and then they try to enter the house to grab the hard drives and split, but the SWAT guys block them. The elf agent tries to pull rank, and the SWAT guys open fire, killing the human agent as the elf starts doing backflips and crazy elf shit to avoid getting shot - it's nice to think of that character actually doing something in the movie. The elf grabs his laptop out of the van as they keep shooting, and some try to chase him before the SWAT leader says their orders are to guard something in the house and to let him go.

* The orcs have taken our trio to an abandoned house, and the leader starts to monologue about growing up in Miami where orc communities thrived and the races coexisted peacefully, then he moved out to LA and became a bus driver and saw how torn apart the communities were and wanted to do his part to strengthen fellow orcs and empower them. He's a gang leader now, but he aims to give back to the community and throws three huge parties every year with no fighting, no guns, no issues - and they crashed one. 

* The interrogation is mostly the same, but they whip both cops with steel chains as the leader asks where the wand is and derides Jakoby for being the token orc friend (this comes across much less on-the-nose, since they don't saturate the dialogue with dumb 'orcs are black people, get it?' lines). They make fun of him for not being blooded and for filing his teeth, as in the movie.

#Through the 'resurrection'

* The cops are whipped with chains and they ask where the wand is. Tikka says there's no wand, and so they decide to take it out on the cops. They ask Jakoby where it is, and . Jakoby says there's no wand (they didn't see Tikka pick it up after the binding spell kicked in earlier), and they punch him in the face and ask again. He repeats that there's no wand, and they slash Alvins' left leg with a blade. They have a towel over his face and he screams through it. Jakoby keeps pleading that there is no wand, so the leader stabs him in the shoulder and twists the knife, saying that the latin gang was chasing them for a reason, so there must be a wand.

* Alvins gets his head loose from the towel and tries to explain and corroborate that they don't have a wand, and an orc punches him in his gunshot wounds. He collapses, screaming, and the orc leader takes his knife from Jakoby's shoulder, pressing it to Tikka's throat. Alvins pleads for her safety and Jakoby yells that they're cops and they can't do this to them, and the orcs start to stomp him out, breaking his nose. 

* Both cops are on the ground, orc leader twists the shit out of Tikka's arm (""wrenches,"" not sure if that's a break or what) and they crumple, Alvins tells them they don't know where the wand is. The orc leader is satisfied and moves them into another room.

* This room has a pit. Like, it just goes down a few floors to the basement and you can see the bottom, it's not some giant fucking Daredevil season two hellmouth covered with a bit of plywood like a home improvement project (jesus christ that was stupid). The cops are lined up beside the pit, and we see dried, bloody chunks at the bottom. The leader wants Tikka to watch.

* Alvins begs for his daughter and hopes she'll forgive him, and Jakoby is silent, except for telling the guy there's no wand and that he's stupid. Just as they're about to be executed, an orc kid stops them and has them turn over. Instead of the realization of ""oh shit it was the wrong kid, AND this is the kid!"" it's much more natural. Still, Papa Orc isn't happy about being made fun of and starts beating the shit out of Jakoby for his insolence, 'life debt' from his son be damned. The kid, and Tikka, look on in horror as the orcs stomp and kick and beat the hell out of the cops.

* Later, the cops are dumped out of the back of a truck, beat to a pulp, and Tikka is tossed out with them (she wasn't beat to shit). As the truck drives off, Alvins goes to Jakoby - his leg is broken, and he's clearly fading. They can't move him - he's too big and they're too weak. Alvins starts screaming as loud as he can for help, but nobody is around.

* Tikka flicks her wrist and the wand comes out of nowhere. Alvins realizes she was the Bright the whole time, and she says her role was to study magic and thwart the Dark Lord's rise. It's not her wand, a witch came to kill her and left her wand behind. She says she can help Jakoby, but not all the way - and if she does, the witch will feel the magic and know where they are. Alvins begs her to help, so she does.

* Jakoby's body snaps and clicks back together as Tikka starts to bleed from the ear. He sits up, and Alvins hugs Tikka as she sinks, exhausted. Jakoby jokes the night just keeps on getting better and they share a dark chuckle, enjoying their brief respite.

* But elsewhere, in an alley, there's a fucked up, veiny lady in a ratty dress leaving disgusting black footprints as she shuffles and twitches, then she whips around as she hears Tikka's magic word to heal Jakoby. She whips around and it's like some shit out of The Grudge and she goes 'mine!'&&""Orcs fucking Sasha Grey""&&Damn I missed it thanks for your service&&Idk. I like the idea that will smith is blessed. He’s not exactly open minded to magic or even diversity. 
In fact he’s very repulsed by it, only to be part of a prophecy and one of the rare few who can use magic. 
It’s a good dynamic I believe and leaves a lot for conflict later. 
It would have been too obvious for Jakoby. An orc who is unbloodied. Hated on by both species. Only to be a rare bright. Not tons of conflict or story to divulge from that. 
From here now they have someone whose going to be hesitant to use it but hunted down for having the ability to. &&I preferred it this way. Jakoby's whole arc is about hi lifelong desire to be a cop and to be accepted. Making him also the super special one in a billion orc bright would kind of take that struggle away from him.  &&Jesus was a Bright. &&Orcs are elves corrupted by Morgoth in Lord of the Rings. In most other fantasy settings Orcs are a seperate race who are typically aligned with whatever flavour of evil that universe has. D&D and Warhammer orcs are just big, bad humanoids with green skin. Warcraft orcs are nothing to do with elves but were corrupted by demons. 

Ironically, pretty much every fantasy setting except Middle-earth has evil dark elves (most LotR-derived RPGs and what-not have 'avari' filling in, but Tolkien never actually had any explicitly evil elves). &&I thought Will Smith's character arc was part of the same prophecy. I wasn't 100% clear on it either, though.&&Yes. People are focusing on the fact that being a Bright means you can toss magic around, but are missing the nuance in one of the lines of dialogue explaining the backstory of the world: It wasn't a Bright that saved the world before. It was a mundane, bloodless orc that united *everyone* to fight the Dark Lord.

Ward might be a Bright, but he will need much more than magic to succeed. That's where Jakoby comes in.&&The respect scene kinda finishes off his ""I want to be a hero and respected"" arc so it was the payoff for becoming orc Jesus. I think it fits the whole underwhelming high fantasy setting.&&I actually liked the fact that the FIRST thing Smith's character does at the sign of trouble is call his wife and order her to get the kid and GTFO. It's smart writing. It's what a smart character would do. And more importantly, the wife doesn't argue, she just does it. So now they're safe, doing smart shit by staying hid, and you no longer have the need for the stupid movie trope where the wife and kids get kidnapped by the bad guy and used for bait.
  
The wife doesn't do anything stupid like go back for a toy. The kid doesn't do anything stupid like talk to the wrong stranger or make a phone call.
  
They GTFO, and stay safe.
  
Seriously, I was so happy to see that whole ""kidnap the family"" trope thrown out the window.&&Yeah, we don't really know how realistic it is to expect a dark lord at all. We have no idea how close they are to summoning him. Bitch already had a wand, so getting it back wasn't a game changer. &&Who is it&&Just don't give him any scenes with helicopters, he can't cut it. &&Nobody brings up animal house&&His dad made both Blues Brothers, and also Animal House, and also An American Werewolf in London, and also The Twilight Zone movie, and probably all of the best films of the 80s (outside of Spielberg).&&[deleted]&&He's been off from social media ever since he was accused in the #metoo movement&&Hold your horses, amigo! BOTH seasons?!&&Yea after watching his interview with RLM it seems like writers don't REALLY get their scripts bought, just the plot points and general story, and on Butch Hartmans podcast when he talked about the never finished Fairly Odd Parents animated movie it seems like he didn't like where the rewrites where going or something and it got stuck in production hell before they gave up on it.&&I've worked in ""Hollywood,"" though it was as an intern and many years ago now.  Major Rewrites up to the days before filming are par for the course.   And attaching a major star to a film suddenly takes it from ""a maybe project"" to something else entirely, usually out of the screenwriter's (or even a lower level producer/production company) hands and into the studio's most trusted people. 

And yes, what the studio is buying is essentially your ""IP,"" not every word you've written.  A good example is chef and entrepreneur [Eddie Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Huang) complaining mightily when his ""fresh off the boat"" concept was absconded by ABC, though the sitcom has been a success. 

FWIW I was involved in the purchase of about 10 scripts (e.g. I got coffee for everyone and sat there, occasionally combined a PDF here and there) and never once did anything come close to $3.5m.  &&This is common practice on every movie. If you're interested or fascinated by the business and work behind being a working screenwriter, check out Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant's book [""Writing Movies for ~~Fun and~~ Profit""](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Movies-Fun-Profit-Billion/dp/1439186766)

It's an honest and humorous guidebook to being a working writer in Hollywood.  Basically gets right into how when you sell a script, it doesn't mean your name will be on it when the movie is released because you will be fired from the writing job, then they'll bring in someone else to give it a fresh take, then they'll fire them hire someone else, then they'll fire them and MAYBE re-hire you, then you'll look at how they butchered your script and you'll go back and make changes to all the things they did so the arbitrator will give you the credit and not them when it's released and then hope you don't get fired again and then you can reap your rewards.

Basically, this is how M. Night Shamaylan came up with ""The Sixth Sense"".  A common Hollywood rumor truth is that he didn't come up with the idea, he was just the last guy to get his hands on the script after a dozen rewrites so he got all the credit for the idea.&&I did script writing as a module at university and my tutor told me that it's really common for someone to basically write a script, it gets accepted, it then gets edited and edited by teams of people and when the final movie is made the original writer rarely even gets a name in the credits because it's changed so much. It didn't make me feel much like doing script writing as a career choice!&&Same for me. Smith’s ‘bad boys’ schtick has gotten old. He’s perfectly capable of serious roles, and I think having that could have helped here; with a sprinkling of humor. Not every fucking line...&&I'm afraid if you don't want Will Smith dialogue in a movie, you shouldn't get Will Smith in a movie. I would have preferred more natural dialogue with someone else in his place but I guess they wanted that sweet Will Smith star power to bring people in.

So many of his lines clashed with the movie's tone (specially the ""prophecy face"" one) and they sound so Will Smith-ish. The movie would have been better without them.

I can't keep from thinking back to another of Ayer's movies, the superior ""End of watch"" and imagine Jake Gyllenhaal (or Peña) in his place and it would have been a better, more tonally consistent movie.

And to be clear End of watch *had* some humor and funny banter but it was consistent to what you would expect between two cop partners and doesn't clashes with the tone when things get darker.&&That's putting it lightly for me. Some of the dialogue was embarrassing &&Will Smith was, in my opinion, a really bad actor to cast in that role. I don't know who I would suggest but it was really out of character for him to be racist towards Jacoby.&&I don't suppose you have a link to the Landis version...? &&Honestly, I enjoyed Smith in this movie. I'm more than a little confused about why some people could've done without him. I'd have changed just how capable he was in this movie. Some random street cop shouldn't be a master marksman Mary Sue, but whatever. The film was great.&&He agreed to do the movie if Jaden could play an elf maiden in the sequel.&&Or a movie or short series that delves more into the past - who was the Dark Lord and how is his presence still felt in different areas today? How has magic shaped the world they currently live in? How did the hierarchy of Elf > Human > Orc come to be? We saw centaurs, dragons and fairies, what other kinds of cool creatures exist?&&Really? Some mothers don't care. She was practically a gold digger. &&Watched this last night.  I had to rewind three times and get up next to the screen and point to it, for her to notice it.  It was done really well.

EDIT: ""her"" is my wife, whom I was watching this with.&&Well, duh - where else would they be?  &&I thought the bearded government guy was supposed to be a dwarf.  A little big, but he looked the part.&&There was a very short cop in the background of the locker room scene. Didn’t have a long bushy beard, but he may as well have been a dwarf. &&CTE by 23&&Yeah, that was a bit over the top. Just have him working out or something. There's no need to rewrite the laws of physics to give them superstrength to that degree. If you accept that, then there's no way the orcs get beat down by human cops in literally the next scene. If you can lift a ton over your head, someone who weighs a tenth of that isn't going to be a challenge. &&I don't think that elfs would be bothered to participate.  They'd think that such a barbaric display would be below their status.&&Man elves seemed to be a bit OP. More agile and dexterous than humans and as strong/durable as orcs.&&Exactly. But they look at what they could potentially make from that higher sale. This happens very frequently in large businesses. Maximize profits as soon as possible and often overlook the simple fact that a slightly lower cost will generate more income in the long run. There was talk a while back about actually offering movies on release day in a streaming type system for the people who want to save on going to theatres. It they prolly killed that idea because theatres would eventually end up like blockbuster.&&Absolutely! Don’t let Disney trick you into thinking movies are just to reinforce the status quo and make you feel good about it.&&#Through the 'boss fight'

* The hit squad (all three) are sitting in a van, and the one that Jakoby popped is holding on for dear life while the others listen to a police scanner. They hear the SWAT guys talking about holding the house down, and speculate that they've found something, as they're off-duty and using private com channels.

* We're in an office in the CA State Department where a lizard dude is playing video games with a guy named Gordon. Gordon's phone starts to ring, but he's not paying attention.

* The elf agent is calling him from an abandoned building. He keeps calling, hoping Gordon notices. There's a hobo dwarf that's trying to ask him if he can have his laptop and sell it for parts, since it got shot through the screen in his escape. He brushes the dwarf off.

* Finally, he picks up after throwing his video game controller in defeat. The agent fills him in that it wasn't a dead lead after all and the witch is actually here and killing people, and the cult is legit, and there's a wand and a bright and gangs and rogue cops and it's a shitshow, but he has evidence, and - the dwarf takes the laptop and tries to run. The agent draws his gun and asks for it back, the dwarf panics and slams the laptop into the ground, shattering it, and runs away. There goes the evidence. He collapses, begging Gordon for help.

* The trio is near a car dealership and limping but surviving. Tikka is spooked, looking out for the witch - the others are more concerned about getting home. Jakoby can't let go of how the orc kid he let go happened to be there - Alvins chalks it up to coincidence, Jakoby believes it has to be a prophecy. He can't shake how strange it is, cause that shit doesn't happen anymore and they're just normal, the 'little people.'

* Alvins is skeptical, but it's keeping Jakoby's mind right so he lets it happen. starts talking about an old prophecy about an unblooded orc named Jirak that fought against the Dark Lord when he learned his intent to destroy the world. He united the orc armies and fulfilled the great prophecy, and was blooded as a result of his bravery. Alvins still thinks it's just one bad night.

* They make it to the lot, and Alvins tries to get the woman in the dealership office to open the door for them as Tikka sees a flickering light that tells her the witch is here. As Alvins continues to plead, somebody whistles - he turns to see Salinas and the rest of the gang surrounding them. He asks for Tikka and the wand, and Tikka steps forward.

* She holds the wand up to use it, and the lights at the dealership go out, but something's wrong. The wand is giving off heat distortions and shit, and Salinas orders his boys to kill them - but they're all mangled and dead, blood everywhere. The witch is already there.

* She tears out Salinas' throat and stands there, ugly and scary as fuck. The cops share a legit funny moment, beat to shit and barely able to stand, as they react to this as if it were just some criminal in front of them (""She seems noncompliant,"" ""Yeah, I'm getting that too.""). Jakoby asks if this is finally it, if they're gonna die now. Alvins says ""if that's what it takes,"" asking if Jakoby's with him. Jakoby says yes, and Tikka steps between them and blasts the witch with a spell.

* The witch deflects the spell and yanks her into the air, the cops grab hold of her and try to get the wand. They both grab it, and the witch pulls them along with it like tug of war. They're straining as hard as they can, bleeding from the palms, and the witch is just cackling. Alvins lets go with one hand, grabs his Taser, and bops her in the face/neck, and she stops pulling the wand.

* Jakoby takes that as cue to pull his service weapon and unloads into her. He reloads (a lot of hits, a lot of misses hitting the cars behind her and setting off alarms), and the witch is hurt but still standing. They realize the both dropped the wand, and Alvins dives for it - he gets dragged across the pavement toward the witch. Jakoby finishes reloading and pops her twice in the dome, and she falls.

* Jakoby collapses back onto the hood of a car and the alarm goes off. His consciousness is fading in and out, but he can't find Tikka anywhere. Alvins is laying on the ground - he flops over, and the pavement tore him up. Jakoby reaches for Alvins, but gives up. Alvins still has the wand, but he can't find Tikka either.

* They wonder where she could have ran, and decide the only option would be 'home,' since she's just a kid. They're obviously not wanting to track her down, saying that they can leave, the binding spell is broken, they can go to the hospital - but Tikka is still out there and in danger. After all, Alvins is the good cop. Jakoby sees him make the call-back joke, but Alvins clarifies that his whole life, people ran out on him, and says the buck stops with him. Someone has to be the good guy. Fuckin character, man. They agree to go back to the house

#Through the climax at the house

* Back at the house, the SWAT dudes got wrecked. The whole street is fucked, and Alvins/Jakoby come across body after body. Alvins heads inside the house while Jakoby grabs a shotgun and goes around the back - but the sniper from before is following him.

* The dude that got blasted is chilling silently on the couch, barely alive, as Alvins sneaks by him. There's a noise in the kitchen, and Alvins and Gibson both make their way toward it - unaware of each others' presence. Jakoby is still getting tailed, and the dying guy is still on the couch. Tikka is the one in the kitchen, hiding, and she sees Alvins but not Gibson - she tries to get his attention, but the guy on the couch sees and calls for Gibson to alert her. 

* Alvins kills couch guy (finally), and he and Gibson spot each other. She shoots him twice in the chest as he shoots the side of her face, and they both drop. Tikka runs to Alvins, and Gibson shoots her in the back. Alvins aims at Gibson, who threatens to kill Tikka and warns him not to shoot. Jakoby comes around the corner, and Alvins stops him from shooting Gibson, who is now getting to her feet.

* She sees her partner moving behind Jakoby and gets Alvins to drop his gun and move to the kitchen table. He's absolutely fucked, but before she can even ask where the wand is, he asks who the fuck she is. She says she represents a 'larger interest,' saying the dirty cop from the initial cop killings called that interest, and that Alvins made a mistake, choosing the wrong side. She says she's going to kill them both, take the wand, and dip. Jakoby sees that he's been flanked just as sirens and lights flash outside.

* The FBI guys are pulling up in big ass SUVs and are surrounding the house, ordering to kill anybody inside with a gun.

* Gibson is shook, and Alvins says as soon as she lowers the gun, Jakoby should take the shot. Alvins reveals that the wand was up his sleeve and points it at Gibson, who seems tickled and intrigued rather than concerned. Alvins tells Jakoby to get Tikka, but Jakoby keeps asking what the fuck he's doing, and Alvins says not to worry - it's a prophecy, right? Jakoby asks if he really believes it, and Alvins says 'no, but you do.'

* Jakoby gets Tikka carefully as Gibson starts fuming, reprimanding Alvins about being born a Bright or having to study, and that he's a fool for what he's even considering. They're in a standoff, Gibson trying to get into his head and Alvins telling her to shut up and her partner asking what to do and her telling him to shut up and Gibson lunges for the wand - Alvins repeats the magic word he heard Tikka say at the dealership and the whole room explodes into fire. He's blown back while the wand explodes and Gibson melts into a flaming skeleton.

* The explosion stuns the FBI guys, except for the elf agent. I guess he's just hard like that.

* Jakoby sees the last hit squad dude square up and he blasts him with the shotty back into the fire.  He can't see Alvins, but he can grab Tikka, so he helps her up and makes for the door while calling for his partner. He stumbles out of the door carrying her as an FBI/SWAT dude yells at him and starts to fire, but the elf agent knocks his gun away and tells the men to fucking help them. They take Tikka, and Jakoby almost collapses.

* Jakoby tries to turn to head back into the house, but the elf stops him. Jakoby says it has to be a prophecy, something bigger, but he's super dazed and can barely stand. The elf tries to get him medical attention, but Jakoby keeps yelling for Alvins, telling them he needs help and that his best friend is still in that building. He breaks down in tears, then asks if he can hear him inside with his improved elf ears or whatever. He says Alvins is dead, but Jakoby roars that he's a liar and shoves him away, running toward the house.

* Jakoby is getting roasted by the flames inside, searching for Alvins - he finally finds his body behind a collapsed wall Jakoby picks him up and leaps through the window they were getting shot at earlier in the day. The crowd outside cheers for them, but Alvins still looks dead. Jakoby drags him clear and starts tending to him, asking if he's okay. Alvins' eyes are opening, staring deadly out into the distance - then he raises his hand and points, telling Jakoby to look.

* Behind Jakoby, the orc gang is standing in a line. The leader raises his hand and cuts it with a blade - the same blooding thing from the ceremony at the end of the movie, but way more powerful now. Jakoby starts to weep, overcome with emotion. He turns back to Alvins, but Alvins looks gone.&&Sounds like a character will smith played,  I dunno,  in I, robot....&&I honestly think the twist might be that they're both Brights.

Looking back, looks like the version I found is the one adapted for David Ayer. It's entirely possible that Landis rewrote his original script for Ayer (this version) who then further changed it to what we saw in the movie 

&&That's pretty cool, perfect part for Jaden&&We've picked this movie's races and beasts apart pretty well over at /r/Shadowrun.  
  
**SPOILERS**  

There were two centaurs. One guarding the entrance of Elf Town, another at the orc beatdown when Ward made Jakoby say he was a cop first. Interestingly, when the cops are beating down that orc on the hood of the police car, not only is there a centaur cop in the background, but there's also a human cop on horseback.  

The sword guy makes a statement that there was an army of 9 races fighting against the Dark Lord. So far the movie has referenced 5 or shown:  

1. Humans
2. Elves
3. Dwarves
4. Centaurs
5. Unnamed Lizard people

The Fogteeth boss orc makes a reference to dwarves partying with them in Miami, although no dwarf is shown to my knowledge.  

The lizard people have at least two references in the opening credits. There's the crosswalk sign showing a bipedal creature with a long face, and there's some graffiti with the Dark Lord holding up 4 humanoids by nooses: a human, elf, dwarf, and some humanoid with a thick, long tail. Presumably the lizard people.  

Finally, and this is hard to see, in the scene with the sword guy in the street, look deep in the background standing on the sidewalk of the street to the right. There are two cloaked humanoids, very tall -- possibly 7' tall, with long faces. This matches up with the graffiti and crosswalk sign, so are probably the lizard people. They're definitely not elf, orc, human, or centaur.  

Tagging /u/_Rand_ /u/CarsonCityCrooner and /u/ultimatecaissie since they seemed interested and I can only tag three.  

edit: Someone asked if there is a thread with screenshots supporting all this. I just made one here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/7nxr9j/bright_metahumans_metasapients_and_critters_with/&&wait, who is ""her""?&&Shouldn't they be somewhere like Alberta?&&heh, I hope we get to see the other races next time.&&So basically the exact same as it currently is&&I don’t think the beating scene is undermined by how strong the orcs apparently are. 

I think it actually makes sense why cops are so brutal and have such short fuses with the orcs. They never hesitate to show their guns. 
This also explains why an orc being beaten by a cop wouldn’t go full berserker. He’s going to get shot in the face without mercy. &&Elf kids played soccer and eat orange slices&&You think at least one elf would like football though.&&#Through the end

* It fades to white, then we zoom out from something brown to find it's a POV shot of hair, and we're looking through Alvins' eyes in his hospital bed. It's his daughter, crawled up onto the bed and resting. He's bandaged to shit, handcuffed to the bed, and the news is playing the events of that night on TV. Jakoby is seated next to him.

* Jakoby tells him they're detained indefinitely, as the FBI has Tikka and are investigating. He fought to let Alvins' daughter be allowed in, as Alvins has been out for two days. They share a moment, glad to be alive, and touch their foreheads together. 

* Tikka is in a windowless cell in custody before a tinted mirror. The elf agent and his boss are there, and someone's trying to get the data off the wrecked laptop. The agent says they could use Jakoby and Alvins if they were to clear them, but his boss says that would be impossible without a smoking gun. All surveillance was wiped out and what evidence the hit squad wasn't able to flush was destroyed by the fire.

* The tech mentions there's some garbled recording from the last night, but that it may take a month to clean up and make decipherable. The elf insists he play it for him then, so he does. It replays the argument the crooked cops made while trying to convince Alvins to turn on Jakoby and kill him, and Alvins refusing. The elf agent's eyes go wide and he sits up, and it slams to black - the end.

##If you read all of these: seriously: [read the screenplay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8f8GCZAhRX_WVBGXy1XSkdJZ1U/view).

I'm not saying it's great filmmaking, but people love familiar. &&And they're probably right. People may joke about how Will Smith seems to play Will Smith and not a character....but it's what his fans generally like to see.&&Let's be real here, Jake Gyllenhal is a way better actor than Will Smith. I grew up with his movies, but you gotta admit, see one Will Smith movie and you have seen him in all Will Smith movies. &&In start of the strip club scene, a human-looking woman blinks at Will Smith with [nictitating eyelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane).  So I assumed the lizard people looked like humans on the outside.&&You might be interested in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Uptomyknees/status/774100109747326976). &&What about fairies?
&&There's a dwarf in the locker room scene at the start. He's in the background getting dressed.&&My wife.  &&Because dwarves only like oil fields and cold? 

[My reaction.](https://media.giphy.com/media/4WHkXdDx8wjS0/giphy.gif)&&Exactly.&&Randy Moss&&Its almost like will smith stars in movies and its usually the main character that gets to do all the cool shit.

Super weird huh.&&He has become somewhat of a Legend in hollywood&&[SMITH SQUAD](https://youtu.be/GAEzK_BDFkk?t=890)&&The reluctant hero/anti-hero? Not in Independence Day tho. &&I felt they were both morally right, just Jakoby more right than Ward

Maybe even going far enough to say Jakoby is Lawful Good and Ward is Neutral good.  Aside from the fact that they're both police officers, which would ultimately put them both in lawful.  Or maybe Ward is *Lawful Neutral? Either way he's lacking in good somehow compared to Jakoby but is ultimately a good guy.

Edit:  meant to say maybe Ward is Lawful Neutral, as he upholds the law but does shady shit in the movie and is motivated by self preservation where Jakoby is motivated by the Law.&& I certainly hope so.&&I think he's supposed to serve a similar role to the orc that united the 9 armies in the past against the dark Lord, so in the sequel he will fulfill that aspect of the prophecy. &&More than likely the sequel is going to deal with the return of the dark lord, since it's heavily implied that he's returning. Then it'll make sense that the prophecy refers to both of them&&That was what I was thinking too.

Honestly this movie reminded me a lot of iRobot in that will Smith has to pair up with someone he hates.  And ends up being baddass purely because he was part robot too. &&I genuinely couldn't tell if they thought that reveal was supposed to be a surprise. Like, you could pretty much guess he was going to be a Bright the moment you found out what that was, because it's a movie. Then they basically state it outright a couple times, before he picks it up an hour later. What a twist!?&&It was pretty good. Not the best movie ever, but I’d definitely watch a sequel. The world building is pretty decent for the type of movie that it is, but you can tell the movie is primed for a sequel and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was already written out to be a trilogy. &&I don't care what the critics say. Bright was fresh and took some risk building the world around it. Its not gonna change your life, but its much better than most content on Netflix or regular Television. &&Its a really enjoyable movie, fast paced and action packed. I thought it was splendid. &&I hope they do. Max Landis said the production company is still interested in continuing they just need someone to distribute now that BBC is out . So if Netflix sees a large enough viewership for season 2 that could possibly happen! Let’s hope &&At least wasn't constantly playing the cynic 20 years ago. 

I prefer light hearted Will Smith over world weary Will Smith, probably because I grew up on the guy in the nineties though&&Or they are/that was a changeling&&I thought that was a call-back to Men In Black, when Will Smith's character runs down an alien with similar eyelids.&&good catch&&Haha you just rendered the entire preceding conversation irrelevant&&ogres and giants? Dope!!  Looks like the ""Brezzik"" in the chart are the lizard people notlogic is referring to.  I wonder what Panahus are?&&Fairy Lives Don't Matter&&If this was Shadowrun, it would be on of what we're calling 'races,' and they might be one of the 9 races mentioned by the sword/shield of light guy. I don't list them, though, because of how they're treated more like a pest. I'm assuming the 9 races that stood up to the Dark Lord are all more sentient and still afforded similar rights in present day.  

It's an assumption that could be wrong, of course. However, if you were to go by the Shadowrun standard, the dragon flying in the background could also count as one of the 9 races.&&Maybe, but he's beardless and appears to be a small human, no different than irl people with dwarfism. There's also a woman who appears to be a human with dwarfism on stage in the strip club.  

It's very possible they are meant to be the dwarfs mentioned by the orc, and one of the 9 races, but they seem to be following fairly standard fantasy tropes with the design of their races, so I'd expect that the dwarf race is bulky, strong, and more stout. The fact that the small person in the locker room doesn't have a beard doesn't exclude him from being a dwarf and dwarfs from being bearded, since Jakoby is also missing a piece of his racial identity with removed tusks.  

Hard to say. I'm expecting they'll give some clarity about dwarfs in the sequel, if not in a trailer.  

edit: honestly the human from the magical task force that is partnered with that elf looks more like a fantasy dwarf than the humans with dwarfism shown in the movie, but that guy is 6' tall, so can be ruled out.&&Her?&&Well oil is black gold, and we all know dwarves love their gold.

It was a fucking booger. &&They should do a regular poster and hide miniaturised versions of Ant Man and Wasp in it, with a prize for the first person to find them&&I was expecting Mac and Me.&&I did the thing where I clicked on the preview button and thought the image was still loading.

I have an insect phobia and not less than 10 minutes ago I had an encounter with one of those fuckers. I was laying in bed looking at my phone when I felt something brush up on my foot. It was this weird ass white beetle looking thing and it was laying on it's back because I guess I kicked it in my fear. I ran over to my desk and put a text book on it. 10 minutes later I take off my text book because I was going to go to bed and the fucker is still alive. I knocked him off the bed with my text book and before it could escape I threw my text book right on top of it and put another one on top just to make sure it won't escape. Now I'm paranoid as fuck that another one of them will start crawling over my face n' shit while I try to sleep.&&Also when Antman goes subatomic in the last film you can see a shadow of the Wasp.

It would be a neat progression to see over the course of the movies.&&I think Hulk would be an interesting addition for Ant-Man 3. Not just because he's now the de-facto ""team-up guy"", but the science angle of both characters could go well together. Like Bruce Banner would have stuff to do, maybe helping out Hank Pym with some research, so it wouldn't be as Hulk-centric as his role in Thor. Plus combining Hulk antics with size-changing antics seems like a no-brainer to me. &&Squashed ants next&&ANTS!&&*sprays insecticide*&&r/thingsforants&&You seem to have mispelt ""A Bug's Life"" good sir&&AND Wasp!&&Or this one:

Marvel pulled off an almost unknown comics team up (unknown to most non comic readers) in Guardians of the Galaxy where DC failed with Justice League. &&Ant Man 2 is probably going to gross more than Justice League

What a world we live in&&They need to decide a Superman arc and show it over 2-3 movies. Also show that he is hope not tell it.&&They just need to make a live action Superman Vs The Elite. It basically carries the notion on why Superman is still relevant and why the folks calling him a pansy boyscout are wrong, oh so very wrong. &&I haven't enjoyed any of the recent DC movies but I genuinely wish there could be a new, good superman movie. Sadly I don't see any kind of reboot or remake of batman v superman is coming any time soon.&&what a world &&Username checks out&&One of the biggest problems (besides the mediocre movies on the DC side) is that many of their characters are like gods.

Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Iron Man are all mortal and actually in danger in their stories. I can't feel the same way about the godlike Superman.&&I don't have confidence in DC, either.&&DC needs to just scrap continuity and do like they do their animated movies.  Do them a day in the life style.  

Really though,even those have been falling off really though, the last 2 Batman ones were pretty meh, and they even got the Rated R on em.  &&What a surprise, one of the highest comments on a picture of a Marvel poster is someone insulting DC. Why is it so hard for people to just enjoy Marvel films without feeling like they need to throw shit at DC?&&Superman is a huge name and trhat name in itself is spendy. Ant man is a low risk, sorta more whimsical, certainly more open ended adventure. Definitely not held to the scrutiny of a century old massively populated fan base such as superman. &&But Batman vs Superman basically was the sequel. And it was hot garbage.&&Marvel understands their characters and how to make entertaining movies about them. DC hasn't figured that out yet.&&MY favorite is: 

 ""I am going to disintegrate you!""  

""*Playing Disintegration by The Cure.*""&&The scene where Thomas the train is about to collide with yellowjacket and he braces for impact and it’s all dramatic then it goes back to normal view and shows the small toy train just tip over on its side.&&Yeah it was cool and all, but have you seen Dr Strange?&&that's also the one scene that made zero sense.  Ant-Man gets his powers to shrink by reducing the space between the molecules in his body. even if you shrink the spaces, you can't be smaller than the molecules themselves. other than that, great movie. &&Kinda like the Doctor Strange [trip](https://youtu.be/ayhTVShJCt0) &&[Boogerman movie confirmed.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ZBF3K9cL.jpg)&&You'd have 94 comments with the answer within 4 seconds.&&Or regular sized Ant Man and Wasp with miniaturized posters hidden within!&&They do that kind of with one of the Ant-Man posters. Or at least, there are three versions of Paul Rudd on the one poster (one as him not in the Ant-Man suit, one as him in the Ant-Man suit but human sized, and one of him very smol in the suit). &&But then what would the thirty thousand Instagram accounts do with their shitty Photoshop skills? &&Just to reveal that neither ant man nor wasp are in the poster&&Maybe something Where's Wally-esque? &&There was one time that Paul actually did bring a [real promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5le9sYdYkM&app=desktop)&&""You done this to me almost 30 times and I'm still fell for it!""&&Lmao&&You're not the only one haha&&How can we expect them to learn how to read, if they can't even fit inside the building!&&At any moment the Yeti will come running and eat them&&That is a great promotion idea. &&I saw the jl movie and it just was a waste of time.

^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot&&I hope they were paid well.&&Minimal.. I see what you did there&&For you last sentence, are you afraid that it will take a dump on your face or that it will crawl all over your face and poop&&That's likely not the same Wasp from this movie- it's the original Wasp, who'd gone missing after going subatomic years prior&&There are 62 episodes of breaking bad over 5 years,  there are 67 episodes of game of thrones over 6 years, 143 of the walking dead over 7. 

Why is it that hard to believe someone would want to watch 20 installments of the MCU over 10? 

Nobody ever said, “I don’t understand how people can even get excited about a new episode of breaking bad anymore” 

I don’t see why it’s really that big of a deal. I don’t go crying when the 10 billionth romantic comedy comes out. &&People like them. Is that so hard to believe? Aren’t you excited about other stuff? &&The first Ant-Man was pretty wacky/fresh as it was basically a heist movie.

Rudd and Michael Pena pretty much *made* the movie.

Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok? I had written Marvel movies off as well, but it was really new and exciting.&&I think it's a mistake to treat all superhero films, or even all Marvel superhero films, as some kind of monolith. I get excited to see some of my favorite characters competently brought to life on the screen. Just as it can be really fun to see a novel you love translated to the screen, it can be fun to see your comic book panels turned into a film. I don't think all of these films are well executed by a long shot, but some of them really captured the spirit of the comics (for example from the MCU, *Dr. Strange*, *Iron Man*, *Guardians of the Galaxy*, *Ant Man*, *Thor*, and *Spiderman Homecoming*). I love comic books, particularly Marvel, and when these movies are done right I feel the same joy watching them that I used to feel reading the comics. That's a great experience! 

Ant Man and the Wasp are just fun characters. Ant Man is actually one of my favorite superhero movies--it's a legitimately well made action film with a great script and well executed CGI. If this sequel is as good, I'll be very pleased. I'm also looking forward to *Black Panther*. &&Same reason people still get excited for the next romantic comedy. The next character drama about a a kid down in his luck but, gosh darn it, that kid finds a way. Or the next wartime drama. What about the people in trouble who need to be rescued? Can’t forget about those lovers making it work over seemingly insurmountable odds. 

It’s all been done a million times. Do you complain about every movie that people get excited for? &&pretty much no one is asking you to understand. Watch the movies you like, let other people watch the movies they like&&I agree bro. Superhero movies have literally  saturated the market, since 2010, it's the same shit over and over.&&Another forgettable formulatic comedy by Marvel being forced to the front page and people acting like it'll be the next Citizen Kane, that's what r/movies has become.&&I did the same thing. Then I realized. Ugh. I'm not a smart man. &&I had a piece of crud on my screen that I thought was a third character.&&I did the same, then looked around hoping the wife didn't see. Im sure I had the ""Oh shit...well then"" look on my face. 😂&&*Steven, get that fly*&&I wiped and it got worse. &&Maybe 'trend' wasn't the best word, but [here's](http://cdn1-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/ant-man-1400875860/antmanposterlarge.jpg) the teaser poster for the first Ant-Man. 

Also, as others are pointing out, the marketing team did a similar thing with the first film's initial trailer.&&Doing small stuff. The first teaser that came out for the first Ant-Man had a super small aspect ratio&&Im going to assume, Down Sizing with Matt Damon also had a poster where the the Damon was ""actual size"" &&There were also [these](http://time.com/3829397/ant-man-billboards/) in some parts of the world&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyGwMqMCta4&&Yeah.

I would love to see her character evolve on screen into becoming Stature (if not literally, even a nod to it would be nice)&&She'll be turning 10 in like a month and a half according to Wikipedia, so if they start production on the third one in, say, summer of 2019 she'd be a tween.&&They had a hulk v antman superbowl ad for coke I think.

I fell for this one. &&Can someone enlighten me a little about this clip. Why does it keep popping up?&&There was s shit post in /r/marvelstudios where it's literally a poster that has an ant and a wasp on it. The wording says something along the lines of ""Fuck it. You'll see this movie anyway""&&[deleted]&&I mean, a new Superman movie could be really, really good... if, say, Marvel Studios made it.&&The 70s Superman movie was and continues to be one of the high points of the superhero genre.

No reason why Superman can't be made into a great film again.&&Marvel also established a fantastic track record. &&Hell, a lot of comic book readers (myself included) didn't know who the GOTG were. &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&They will somehow shoehorn Batman and more DC heroes in it without giving him his own movie.&&Maybe now that Snyder is out they can. A nihilist, frank miller worshipping man, can never make a superman movie. Period. &&They can do anything with Superman and it will probably work. Captain America worked in his 3 solo movies despite this notion of 'boringness', and all 3 were different from each other.&&The Boy Scout gets downright *scary* for a bit toward the end.&&How about

>Superman Red Son: No Collusion&&It’s a piss poor attempt of DC to diss their own writer Warren Ellis for his groundbreaking works on Stormwatch, Authority etc. The entire story is hypocritical (or lack of self awareness).&&Not even *Wonder Woman*? Watching that, I actually think Patty Jenkins would be capable of making a good Superman movie.&&The upcoming Flash movie has a strong possibility to be a reboot, as it's titled Flashpoint, which is also the title of a dc comic book event that rebooted the franchise.&&They need to get rid of their product managers on the WB side, they've been approving very bad ideas, like hiring Snyder and his awful boring scripts, plus that disaster mix called Superman v Batman: stay away from the other movies, Lex Luthor is a serious clever villain, he's the POTUS!! Stay close to the comics, there are some stories that have worked very well over the years, why not following them?!

The last thing, not approving Affleck's Batman script, seriously?! I bet it was crude, dramatic and closer to what Nolan did before&&> genuinely wish there could be a new, good superman movie

Same. I feel like they're much too scared to just play Superman straight. Don't deconstruct him, don't turn him evil, don't explore his symbolism; just let him be the big blue boy scout. I do feel like comparisons to Marvel are well-worn out at this point, but their decision to keep Captain America morally true, but then place him in morally-grey circumstances is a great way to a 'lawful good' character interesting.&&The main thing i didnt like in the superman movie was the forced romance and kiss at the end between superman and the reporter chick. That was SO bad. &&Scott: Hey, how's your girl, man?

Scott: Oh.

Luis: And my mom died too.......and my dad got deported. But I got the van! 

Scott: It's a nice van!&&I know Peyton Reed actually came up with the Michael Peña flashback scenes that a lot of people assumed were Edgar Wright's doing. But if there's one thing in the movie that I have to imagine coming from Wright it's the Disintegration joke. It's so in-line with his sense of humor and his music taste. &&More likely:

*”Here’s what I found on the web for ‘Ian Jehovahs’s Witness poo’”*&&My friends and I got into the tradition of seeing all Marvel movies drunk for the first time, ever since we accidentally did it for the original Thor.

That definitely changed with Dr Strange. The first 10 minutes of Dr. Strange made me sober up fucking quick, cause I was feeling nauseous as fuck &&You know that reducing the spaces between the molecules wouldn't actually shrink someone, right? It would just crush and kill them.

Besides, as far as I remember, they never explain in the movie how the shrinking in the MCU works. It could be that the atoms in his body shrinks (as believable and physically impossible as the other explanation)&&There's plenty that doesn't make sense regarding his weight/size ratio. I just learned to let it go.&&Not if the poster is in 4K ULTRA HD IMAX SURROUND SOUND!!!&&*sigh...* relevant username. &&ELI5 Mac meme.&&It needs to be at least... three times bigger than this!!&&Don't forget the terrible flash that's continuously tripping, I know he was meant to be like the funny but I feel like even that failed&&Couldn’t agree more.
I expected so much more from them.
But they had to spoil it by rushing everything.
The whole thing seemed so forced to me.
The story, character introductions and pretty much everything else in the movie.
Also watching Superman felt like i was watching some iteration of Injustice storyline.
Infact even an Injustice storyline would’ve been comparatively way better than what they currently produced but tbh all we needed was a solo Flash, Aquaman, Green lantern and maybe a wonder woman 2 before they produced a JL movie.&&Good bot&&Seriously. I hope all the designers of Marvel's posters get paid well.

They are far and away some of the best poster art I've seen in recent memory.&&And who hopefully gets an interesting position going forward.

&&Lol ""the Damon"" makes it sounds like some animal you'd go watch at the zoo&&WASPS&&Showhosting is all fun and games till you've got Paul Rudd as your guest&&Every time Paul Rudd goes on Conan and they go to show a clip of whatever movie he's promoting, they instead show this clip from the terrible low-budget-ET-knockoff-slash-McDonalds-advertisement Mac and Me. It's been a running joke for like 15 years now.

[edit:] Also, when he was on the show to promote Ant Man they made a big deal over how Marvel wouldn't let him do this anymore, only to show the clip anyway.&&True, but it’s also legitimately a hilarious poster&&lmao

its true tho

&&I'll bet that there will be a promo where they argue over whether Wasps or Ants are better.&&GIVE THE RIGHTS BACK TO MARVEL&&Hey - if worked for Sony.

I know that Superman's probably not the kind of character Nolan would choose to make a movie about, but it sure as hell would be better than anything else DC has made compared to the Dark Knight trilogy.&&I want a Netflix series of Red Son. I want it like I want air.&&Because DC keeps blowing all the good villains in other movies or minor plot points. At this point to make a good super man movie would require a reboot of the DCEU&&you clearly havent seen italian spiderman. the true benchmark for a spiderman film
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhHhXukovMU&&As a person who’s not big into superhero movies, maybe I might be helpful from the opposite perspective. I’ve always thought Superman as a hero is very generic. And I mean that not in an insulting way, but rather that it is so iconic that it has sort of “lost its touch” over the years. In a similar way to the old Mario and Zelda games. 

All of these were iconic and amazing in their time, but not particularly outstanding if put alongside today’s standards. The anti-hero seems to be a popular character nowadays, and I think it stems from trying to create a more unique super hero experience. I loved Deadpool because it wasn’t something that necessarily fit the super hero formula. Superman pretty much *is* the formula. Because of that it doesn’t interest me as much to be honest. And I think a lot of people feel the same. &&>No reason why Superman can't be made into a great film again.

The reason right now is DC themselves and their current movie format. 

&&Because they want Superman to be dark and gritty which just doesn’t work. Tons of characters can move between boyscout and gritty and it makes sense but Superman is supposed to be the poster boy for hope not doom. &&Totally agree. DC has simply proved they can’t pull it off though. Absolutely nothing wrong with the source material. It’s the execution that is ass&&Marvel took their time establishing the universe. And Kevin Feige has done a terrific job in maintaining the universe. I am not a fan of a lot of the movies that marvel has made, but they fit into the universe perfectly. All i got for my justice league money, was captain photoshop mustache. &&Their movies do the basics of movie making well. The stories highlight why the characters are popular. Distilling the important essence of them and even if they have to change details the characters are true to what their fans think of the character.

They have flimsy villains but the interesting bit is the protagonists struggle not so much the villain. The stories also distill the essential parts of the arcs they come from.

By contrast, DC (Snyder) films play fast and loose with the characters and seemingly jam their major arcs as minor plot points. Destroying the things that made their characters interesting and rolling over plot without any build up or care.

More than just track record, Marvel just does it better in general. &&TFW Justice League can't out gross Dr Strange.&&Yeah, saying Warner Bros completely dropped the ball is an understatement. &&Animals are trending well, everyone loves animals. Get super dog in there, and super horse as well, are there any other super animals? Lets go with super lemurs, lemurs are hot right now, who cares if its not canon, we had Batman shoot people with a machine gun for gods sake. &&Captain America didn't just work, it is the most consistently great trilogy in Superhero films right now. &&And that was perfect. It shows the true scary power of Supes, if he ever decides to go all out and removes all the limitations he sets on himself so that he maintains the do no harm to others philosophy. &&I'm sad we'll never have a 'Superman unleashed' type of scene [like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GDNd8b_QOo)

A crying shame. &&Wonder Woman's claim to fame is that it stars a female protagonist, and is a DC movie that doesn't blow complete ass.

If those two things weren't so novel, then the movie itself is just wildly generic and formulaic.&&Ehh, wonder woman was good but I feel like it could've been more memorable. Also putting her cameo in BvS before doing her actual movie felt kind of weird because she just sorta popped up and didn't do much.&&I hope the live action people take some notes from the animated movie, because Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox was great. &&Ooh, I didn't know the new movie was gonna be based on Flashpoint, in that case it could be good.&&So basically they're going the Fox X-Men route of having reboots and remakes and regular films all mashed together into a confusing jumble of plot threads.

Just start the fuck over, fresh. This baggage is going to hold them back.&&I don't think anything will fix the fact that Superman lacks internal conflict as a character. He's an alien come to Earth, and he fights evil because he is good. His only weakness is magic green moon rocks, because otherwise he'd be entirely unstoppable. He's been kept as far from real ethical dilemmas as possible, because he's really a projection of how people want to see themselves with power - good guys who don't have to think about what they are doing.

He's also overpowered. It's cool at first, but in the end it makes for less interesting film. There's less suspense. His villains have to be alien, super-powerful, magical, mystical, mutant beings, or else there's no tension. BvS tried to make his antagonist Batman by giving Batman a giant suit, and it still was too goofy to actually carry the film. 

Batman has been a never-ending blank check of box office success, because he is entirely human and can be challenge and even undone by the simplest of foes. But Superman? BvS was a disappointment. Man of Steel grossed about as much as JL has. Superman Returns was god-awful. When you stop to think about it, the last good Superman film starred Christopher Reeve.

That speaks to the bland nature of the character, not to Hollywood.&&> the reporter chick

You don't know the name Lois Lane?&&Lois Lane? &&Every Edgar Wright movie with a fight scene has this happen.&&>But if there's one thing in the movie that I have to imagine coming from Wright it's the Disintegration joke.

And you would be... wrong! That was once again something Reed added:

>“In the briefcase battle, we knew we wanted to have an iPhone joke,” Reed says. “We had all these different versions of jokes, like, Yellow Jacket saying, ‘You’re going to end up dead!’ and then you’d hear ‘Searching for the nearest Panera Bread.’ There were some funny jokes and some not-so-funny jokes, but, at the end of the day, they were just jokes. What if he activated the music feature? What would it be? I’m a massive Cure fan. We came up with a bunch of things, but we thought we could find a joke for ‘disintegration.’ The first song on Disintegration, which is the second CD I ever bought, was ‘Plainsong’. It’s such an epic song that it transcended the joke — scoring this whole battle in a briefcase. There was this weird, cold wave goth vibe, changing the character of that action scene. You have all these action scenes you want to have a different flavor. Then it became a question of, ‘Will [The Cure frontman] Robert Smith let us use his music?’ He ended up loving it, so he did.”&&The entire third act is one giant fight scene that laced back and forth between humorous, terrifying, and awesome. Seems like the kind of act that he would be proud of to make considering his portfolio.&&The first 10 minutes were pretty great, but Strange's first encounter with the Ancient One is where the real juice is at. &&Not my theory, but I think the best way to explain the Pym particles would be for Dr. Strange to talk to Hank Pym about how his work isn't actually science, but accidental magic.

Spider-Man 1 and Spider-Man 2 are without a doubt some of the best superhero movies with Spider-Man 2 being considered by many the best Spider-Man movie of all time, and in my personal opinion one of the greats in the entire superhero genre due to mainly it's ability of branching out to casual movie-goers, critics, and superhero fans and succeeding. 
Then they messed it up by pushing him to do Spider-Man 3 at a pace that he wasn't thrilled with, and a villain he didn't want in there.&&Spider-Man 1, 2 and the Amazing Spider-Man were all great. Spider-Man 2 is still comfortably my favourite.&&They're still making Venom and Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse which comes out this year. &&Superman -can- be interesting, not because of his unstoppable unlimited power and abilities, but the implications of that power.  Some of his best comics and animated movies play with it, and the Justice League movie, for all its faults, touches on it briefly.

Superman's greatest strength is his patience and compassion.  He could eliminate evil within seconds of it happening and kill villains instantly like bugs. He could keep order out of fear easier and better than Batman could ever hope to achieve, but he doesn't.  He appreciates and loves humanity flaws and all, and sees a better path if people slowly find their way to build a better future on their own means, and tries to live as a positive example to passively influence people to do better in their own lives, instead of always being hands-on in forcing a positive outcome to everything.

Some of his best stories take that angle and twist it, either by making Superman a villain, creating moral dilemmas where using his power to force an outcome would be 'bad', or pointing out issues with his power (mostly through Lex Luthor as a champion of human self-determination).

[Often used Reddit Example](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ijdxh) of a ""good"" Superman.&&Superman isn't really meant to fight batman villains though, he has his own cast of people to fight. He's not invincible, just stupidly strong, so tends to fight other stupidly strong guys too, like darkseid or brainiac or other similarly insane things.

Having doomsday be a villain they throw in at the end of another movie and then kill off is a waste.

I just think they've failed to capture Superman's strength or the strength of his villains well, so he comes across as boring.&&Superman is not my favorite superhero, much for the reasons you describe. Also, I hate kryptonite as that ""oh shit we forgot to give him any weaknesses"" plot device that he can always just barely overcome if he really, *really* wants to. 

That said, I don't think he's boring. I really like Lex Luthor, because he's undeniably a villain, but a villain with a really good point: An individual with godlike powers who isn't human and has no obligation to humanity might not be the best thing to hang all our hopes on.

I think the key to a good Superman story is not to try to remove or weaken his powers, since they're sort of the whole point of him. Rather, you need to give Superman a problem that can't be beaten with strength. Have a villain who makes the people of earth hate Superman. Have a villain who possesses other people so Superman can't kill him, but only the innocents he controls. Have a villain who is a literal god who must be convinced that humanity deserves to live.

The bottom line is that if the main conflict of the movie can be solved by hitting the Big Bad Evil Guy hard enough, all tension dissolves as soon as Superman arrives, a la Justice League. There will never be any question that Superman can hit hard enough.&&Maybe if they didn't make him so massively overpowered compared to the rest of the justice league and didn't waste his death they could have given him a more serious threat.&&Easy, just ditch the Gritty Realistic Portrayal of Grounded Super Heroes and just go full 1950's comic book. Don't just emulate it, embrace the campy nature of super heroes and how ridiculous it all is.

Make Superman fun. &&> Superman is such a boring character

For a long time people said the same thing about Captain America, being that he has boring boy-scout personality and boring non-super-powers. And yet they made it work.&&Superman was always a little bit my favourite because he's so overpowered. In theory that cuts out all the generic threats and leaves so much room for philosophical dilemma and space threads. 

And I don't think his personality is boring. I think there is a lot to explore in a personality that's trying really hard to be vanilla good.&&At this point making a good DC movie would require a reboot of the DCEU.&&I wouldn't blame it on the lack of good villains so much as DC just being plain bad at film. Odd castings, odd artistic directions, odd everything. These guys just don't get it. &&Superman's powers have become formulaic but his story is classic. If his movie had focused more on his struggle to fit in and be human and be human as opposed to being a slug fest between godlike beings, then we might have had a decent movie. His stories are actually pretty good when they focus on Clark Kebts struggles rather than Superman's battles.&&How do you feel about Captain America? I used to feel similarly to him as you are describing Super Man; essentially it’s a little boring having a hero who always does the right thing, and it’s more interesting watching an anti hero struggle with deciding what to do. 

However, with the way the marvel movies have portrayed Captain America in the recent movies, I have started to find his moral compass refreshing. It’s nice to see a hero who truly is humble, self assured, and wants to do his best to help the most amount of people, no matter what. At the same time, Super Man is being portrayed in the DCEU as the character that is struggling to make decisions because he doesn’t know what is right. And this is terribly boring to me. 

Basically what I’m saying is that either type of hero can work, it just depends on how they execute that character. Super Man has been executed as a character very poorly recently, while Captain America has been a better version of the classic character that Super Man is supposed to be. &&There's nothing wrong with Superman as a hero. Studios just continue to completely fail to execute a Superman film properly.

Even if your story is formulaic, if it is executed well, you end up with a good film. Regardless of genre.&&Superman is often considered generic because he is relatively perfect. He has nearly every power in the book and doesn’t have many weaknesses or flaws (save for kryptonite). 

One reason there’s been such a shift in superheroes is because modern characters are becoming less “perfect” and more relatable. The new Marvel characters all have flaws that Marvel explores pretty well IMO, but the DCEU just seems to confuse this idea and  makes all their characters overly dark and anguisty. 


One scene I like is in Guardians of the Galaxy, when Rocket asks Peter “why do you wanna save the Galaxy?” And usually any other hero would give some speech about how it’s the right thing to do etc. but instead Peter just yells “because I’m one of the idiots who lives in it!”. Anti-hero’s and less “perfect” characters can be a breath of fresh air compared to what we’re used to, 
&&[deleted]&&Are you saying the new Mario and Zelda games are no good?&&to steal a line moviebob used in his ""Batman v. Superman"" analysis:

> we had to have in 2016 a global pop culture conversation about whether or not it would be too scary, sad, violent, traumatic or emotionally scaring for children to watch a movie about Superman. SUPERMAN!

I mean, wtf?!
&&DC could make some shot for shot live action remakes of their animated movies that would be better than what they've put out.&&> They have flimsy villains but the interesting bit is the protagonists struggle not so much the villain.

That's because, in most cases, the villain isn't the source of the real conflict in the story.

Take *Iron Man 3,* for instance. The villain we first see turns out to be a nobody. The actual villain is more impressive because we know *why* he turned bad. But the conflict in the story is between Tony Stark and his dependence on his machines. He has to re-learn how to act on his own without a protective layer, and he doesn't win until he gives it up.&&also, regarding the villains, it's just a matter of time restraints.

it's not a coincedence that (at least in my perception) that Loki is usually considered the best villain of the MCU movies - he also had most time in them to make him a more interesting character.

(also the reason that many of the Marvel tv show villains are significantly more interesting because unlike the movies we get to spend more time with them)
&&Raimi's Spiderman grossed almost as much in home video sales as JL has grossed worldwide in theaters.

After BvS did as well as it did, and Wonder Woman also, and the hype of getting a team together, this might be the biggest sequel fumble ever. And that's saying something, since Sylvester Stallone directed a sequel to Saturday Night Fever.&&And certain fanboys think that was the *definitive* version of Batman.&&That was Krypto the Super Dog and Comet. You could also bring in Beppo the Super Monkey, Streaky the Super Cat. They, along with Proty the shapeshifting protoplasm were members of the [Legion of Super Pets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Super-Pets). Add Wonder Twins as needed.&&Snyder loves Frank Miller. I am surprised that this Batman didn’t start with racist slurs against Muslims at one point. &&The sad part is, as much as I loved the near Godlike superman in Justice League, they made him too OP. I would have loved a full on Steppenwolf vs Supes battle. Supes would win of course, but Steppenwolf is still a general of the army. It would have been interesting.&&My $0.02 on the matter: you know what would've made it a lot less formulaic? Ares not being there at all. Like, remove the whole last Ares fight, and make Wonder Woman realize that Ares' corruption ran through the blood of mankind intrinsically, and that it's up to wonder woman (and other heroes like her) to be paragons of - dare I say it - ***hope*** for those who haven't given into the corruption of war.

Sure, it's a bit cliché, but the Ares fight seemed so shoehorned in that it really felt like it didn't belong there (not to mention the CG of Ares' body was... decent, at best)&&To me Wonder Woman has a 3rd act that actively contradicts everything that came before it and is a worse version of Thor and Captain America 1 (which Wonder Woman was a mix of). 

Cap did a better job with the war setting and having a hopeful character fighting for justice and peace. 

Thor was the mystical character that is the fish out of water that has to learn humility on Earth, with his half brother being a better villain than Ares ever was. &&While it was, what people liked was how Diana's character was done. It's very well done, and she has full character arc in the movie. Another thing is tone that reminded of 70s Superman - hopeful with a bit of naivete.

Compared it Snyder's Superman who was robbed of character arc in 2 movies and and had very one note character.&&Really? It seemed to me that she was doing much better against doomsday than both batman and superman.&&I feel like WW in BVS is like my favorite part of that movie.

That music when she shows up and proceeds to just kick ass is awesome.
&&Feels like they burned through 60 years of iconic comic arcs in 5 years of bad movies.&&Could also be bad considering they're going to be shoehorning in Aquaman, wonderwoman, the amazons, atlanteans, batman, joker, Cyborg, and the reverse flash. 

If they follow the animated Flashpoint movie, which is basically exactly what people want. It's also a good movie.&&Very likely not the only one, here, but imo she felt less like Lois Lane, reporter extraordinaire, and more like Lois Lane, semi-mcguffin and damsel in distress&&Its 1:30am and i have work at 5am.

I was only a little tipsy by that point, and boy was that a wild ride.&&You see, Doctor Strange bought into Ancient One’s way because he is really just a “jock” surgeon. A true “nerd” of science like Hank Pym just creates and studies magic using methods of science. At least that is how it was explained in comics, where Hank Pym was given the title of Scientist Supreme by the same cosmic entity that named Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme.&&That is the best explanation to every amazing thing they can do, because every super power or super technology they have go against the laws of thermodynamics. So magic is a better explanation than science&&Look up ""Mys-Tech"". They're a shadowy organisation created by Marvel UK in the 90s to act as antagonists for a lot of properties they were developing back then. They pretty much fit the description of what your suggesting. The board of Mys-Tech made a Faustian deal with Mephisto about a thousand years ago which eventually lead to them being a multinational occult technology developer. Marvel UK in the 90s was utterly bonkers and produced a whole slew of IPs I think would be great for TV in the modern era. Particularly ""Warheads"". Check it out.

Everything else is just them fucking around and letting everyone around them die when they could end things within 5 seconds. &&[removed]&&I didn't even know Blade was a comic till I saw the Marvel logo on Blade 2.

I still like Toby M Spiderman flicks more than Garfields attempt.  I love Venom but Spiderman 3 was bad, Topher Grace was horrid as Eddie Brock.&&Blade proved to Marvel that their IP could be commercially successful on the big screen. The popularity and following that series developed definitely helped pave the way for this era of comic book movie blockbusters. 

Blade also helped mark a transition away from the campy comic book character adaptations of the 90s such as Batman Forever, Batman & Robin and Judge Dredd. 

It instead moved us toward more believable contemporary settings with more fleshed out characters and better style, which helped to build the immersion and that sense of legend that you should feel for the heroes of any story.

I think you could go as far to say that Blade helped pave the way for all modern comic book films, particularly darker adaptations, and even made films like The Dark Knight series possible.

Having said all this, if you had to pick out a single film that launched the genre as we know it, it would have to be X Men, as it truly launched the comic book blockbuster for the wider market. After all, it was the first critically and commercially successful comic book ensemble movie, which is what we have become so accustomed to over the past few years.

Though perhaps most significantly, X Men showed how easily marketable this genre is to 21st century audiences.

Edit: It's also interesting to note that Kevin Feige's first two production credits were Blade and X Men.&&Oh yeah - Toby’s movies definitely were groundbreaking. 

I think it’s the Amazing Spiderman run that got everyone fed up with Sony. Good movies no doubt, but doing the origin again for seemingly no reason and then plowing through to a rush and unneeded 3rd movie to fast were rough on fans I think. &&I’ve learned from Reddit that I’m one of 5 people who enjoyed Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man films. &&The attempt to form a Spiderverse was horribly misguided and money grubbing..   The fact they didnt think the fanbase would roll their eyes at the notion is hilarious to me.   Sony is ran by the equivalent of out of touch parents that are trying to be cool.  It works when making dogshit animated movies,  because the critics dont matter,  but anything else is just..   eh..     Hell,  Im not even that big a fan of the sony era bond films, but thats the only thing they've ever really consistently done well,  even if skyfall's final act was obviously butchered by focus groups.&&Spiderman 1 hasn't aged terribly well. Especially with Maguire and Dunst supposed to be playing teenagers.

Edit: Spelling.&&personally I think ""Spider-Man 2"" is easily still among the best superhero movies ever.
&&Spiderman 1 hasn't aged terribly well. 

The stiff goblin mask and the special effects.
Also, the fact that 25 year old Tobey Maguire was supposed to playing a teenager in high school.
Atleast, by Spiderman 2, he is in college.&&True. 1 and 2 were very solid. Definitely loved them.Comparing only 3 to now is probably unfair. But I mean there is no way to argue that rolling SM into the MCU wasn’t a great financial decision. They get to origin. Again. Sigh. And then of course make use of the writing and more importantly marketing machine of Marvel. &&Damn dude. Thanks for that. It was the first time *I* saw it.&&[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BJ1-trrgqc) is one of my favourite superman moments - Lex Luthor takes advantage of Superman's distrust of him and manipulates Supes into causing a very public televised scene with Captain Marvel (Shazam) and levelling an entire new development of (conveniently uninhabited) buildings, making him look like a dick (which he kinda was at the time). He definitely has weaknesses, just not the traditional superficial ones.&&Also on the flipside it’s always badass when you get to see Superman really let his power out. I’ve never read much of the Comics but I love the cartoons and the clip has always been one of my favorites. 


https://youtu.be/1zFsxSH8fUA&&[This](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305) is a really good Superman.
&&I'm no where near a Superman fan but read Superman birthright
It's a great book and not only shows what Superman doesn't use his full strength 24/7 &&Jesus... I never saw that example before. I can't believe it, but it teared up a bit at the last panel. 

I would never had thought comic with boring old Superman could pull that off.&&It worked for captain America. Why won't it work for superman right?&&Good thing they have Flashpoint as their first Flash movie...

If they could get a director.&&I still feel that Man of Steel was a great movie, but every other DC movie couldn't even do what MoS got right.

Take Wonder Woman as another standout movie in the DCEU, but asides from that it really does seem like DCEU needs another start from all the trash movies it got.&&Wonder Woman?&&I feel they are just taking themselves way too seriously. There’s very little fun bits now. That’s why the 70s Superman worked Christopher Reeve pulled off the nobility of Superman and the goofiness of Clark Kent. Also Margot Kidder really put some sass into Lois Lane. Yeah she’d get into trouble but she also had real strength in her personality. Superman 1 and 2 were well done. I think it helps that Superman tries to hide who he really is from Lois, and even when he tries to be real with her he realizes her knowing hurts her and still makes being together impossible so he does the noble thing and makes her forget. (As a plot that works… yeah they do kinda fudge what his powers are though). 1970d Superman is humble and sacrifices things he wants for the greater good. Isn’t afraid to look foolish either. [I think this scene sums it up best](https://youtu.be/tNUu6Lf9mVU)

I haven’t seen Justice League, but the modern Superman/Batman are so afraid of becoming campy again they’ve pushed themselves into becoming too gritty. The audience is tired of that. It would help if there didn’t chop up a Frank Miller comic and suck out the plot to just show one iconic scene (Dark Knight returns). 


And I swear to fucking god we don’t need to see Batman’s origin story every fucking time. 

Marvel has gotten fun because the characters behave like people you want to know. Superman today seems like a brooding self righteous prick. Batman is a little better, he has a little sense of humor but not by much.  WW I found fun but I’m concerned she ends up too serious too. That his he s tiring after a while. &&There was a phrase like “DC is about superheroes trying to be regular people, and marvel is about regular people trying to be superheroes” 

Except we’re getting a movie about a superhero being a superhero&&Who is this Clark Kebts people keep talking about?&&That was one of the things I thought Man of Steel had going for it, was Clark being this nomad trying to hide who he really is, but at the same time not being able to NOT help when help was needed.  
  
But they decided to fast track over that part and give us 2 hours of crap instead.&&[deleted]&&I agree but I do think there’s room for the hero who just wants to do the right thing. 

Wonder Woman was basically a giant “it’s the right thing” to do speech - just done well. I think it’s because she wasn’t anguisty. She actually seemed to have very little problems besides being sheltered and naive and that was refreshing.

I like the anti-heroes but for me, Captain America has consistently had great movies and he’s in the category of “it’s the right thing to do.” It just works because he feels like a real person. I know people like him - people that just want to help. &&>One scene I like is in Guardians of the Galaxy, when Rocket asks Peter “why do you wanna save the Galaxy?” And usually any other hero would give some speech about how it’s the right thing to do etc. but instead Peter just yells “because I’m one of the idiots who lives in it!”.

This is it, you win.

I could have never given better argument. DC characters are god like. I don't like God's of real life let alone comics.

Marvel is more relatable. You could even relate to bad guys of marvel. Like the one from civil war. I Probably would crash and burn the world if anything happened to my family. I see why he did what he did.
&&His powers were really over-exaggerated compared to the rest of the justice league in that movie. I mean, he made the flash seem like an average person compared to an Olympic sprinter and beat wonder woman in a straight brawl.&&And his powers are so common nowadays. The only thing he has that's unique is his superbreath, which is a laughable power.

The only interesting Superman stories are the philosophical ones. The ones where his morals get challenged.&&DC has all the stories. So many good stories. And the choose the most generic, everyone knows stories and makes terrible choices with those stories. &&Pretty much. But why they dont, thats the question. They could have so easily made older Bat movie, that everyone wanted, but noo they had to rush BvS.

They could have made Suicide squad into perfect us politic dirt job heist, and no they did not. 

At least they learned with WW,  but still kind messed up the second half.

Seems like they hire people who dont know their comics at all. Contrary to that MCU has people whom actually like it, take care in it, and make you like even small things. I mean I ised to be meh boring dude about Captain America in comics, but now he has suprisingly become my favourite avenger. &&Fuck it. Let's just do claymation batman starring Kevin Conroy. &&Welp found my new favorite fact about JL under performing &&The definitive was done in the animated series, and movie wise, its Batman Begins Batman that is definitive and still remains my favorite from the Nolan Trilogy. &&And the crazy thing is, *that's what the movie was building up to*.  The entire subplot with Chris Pine is that there are bad people even on the ""good"" side (and there's that throwaway line about them stealing land from the Indians), and hell it's WWI, there really were no ""bad guys"".

But no, instead of actually saying something about mankind just being shit to one another, we gotta have Ares be the cause of it all so the Germans can throw down their weapons at the end and start hugging American soldiers.  The third act is so atrocious it makes the first two acts worse in retrospect.&&[deleted]&&I wouldn't have even minded Ares (although I would have preferred him teased at being real towards the end) if it was entirely CG/a different actor. Remus Lupin does not make a good Ares, even if the reveal was surprising. &&The Ares fight really sucked imo&&Plus we get this plot that results in her trivializing all the effort of the soldiers who fought and died in the effort to end the war.&&Yeah, it checked all the boxes.  It's an adequate movie.&&She was the plot device that allowed them to kill Superman so that they could have an actual Justice League movie. Superman literally solos the bad guy himself. the rest of the league just beats up on the lackeys. &&I'm sorry to hear that.

Now we're at ""science is actually magic we sort of fell into somehow"". 

I don't know if Marvel set out to gently acclimate audiences to a little bit more weirdness with every movie, but it's great. &&*lands upright holding unspilled teacup*&&[removed]&&Damn.&&[oh no Vegeta!](https://youtu.be/0CSFfMCFNAA)&&Where's this from?

Great movie.&&If you haent read the sony email leaks, there's a whole lot more reasons to hate sony than amazing spider-man 2. Their comments are infuriating. As an example, they asked Kevin feige for suggestions on amazing spider-man 2. He gave them solid advice to think about and change and they ignore 90% of it.  All the problems he pointed out (like Peter's parents doing nothing in the movie, making the apider venom unique yo thr parker bloodline, and electro turning to quickly into a villain) were kept in the movie.&&One of the other five checking in. Although I'm pretty biased in that I just love Spider-Man, so it'd be tough for them to make a movie that I didn't like. &&I still think Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man was the best Spider-Man we’ve had on screen

The second one was rubbish, granted.&&then I am one of those 5 too?! Nice to meet you! :)  
I really enjoyed Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, he was glorious. I am not sure about the Peter Parker part because Toby nailed that pretty good. I think the perfect thing for me would be Toby as Peter and Andrew as Spider-Man.&&At least you're not the only one who liked Spider-Man 3.&&There are a handful of us lol &&What was the final act originally supposed to be?&&I was a young twenty something when Spider-man 1 was released. The effects weren't the greatest even to the average film goer of the time. There were noticeably bad parts. Great cg special effects have been around for ages by that time btw. Matrix, Star Wars Prequels, LOTR, Jurassic Park, T2, etc. I am guessing that the effects budget wasn't as high as some of those other films- which the effects only needed to be serviceable anyhow. They had to retool the film somewhat after the [Twin Towers](https://youtu.be/JMG5Td1839k?t=85) fell. Maybe that affected the budget some. &&It really is a great example. In one panel it defines exactly who he is. He could have just flown up there, grabbed her, and brought her down into custody but he would always rather people come to understand on their own why their choices might not be the best. Batman is amazing because of his efficiency. Superman is amazing because he does things compassionately despite its incredible inefficiency. The former creates vengeance. The latter changes hearts.&&Yup...so good...as a Flash fan I am *thrilled* that they think the best opening standalone story for the Flash is Flashpoint. It seems like a really really really really smart and good idea.&&It's easy to be standout when the other movies in the franchise are crap.&&Honestly, I don't really think I liked Wonder Woman.  Part of me feels like I should say I do, but that's probably only due to everyone else claiming its a good movie.  I went with my gf, and while she loved it for feminist reasons, I fell asleep by the end of it.  Nothing stood out to me, and if its a good supethero movie, then its on par with maybe Ant Man at best.  Essentially, its the standard, safe kind of superhero movie, but not worth a second watch and not that exciting.  I just don't see what the appeal was.  

BvS was even worse, because the setup for it sucked.  I don't know how to describe it better than that.  I cant put my finger on it really, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth, whereas I loved MoS.  I can say that the Social Network guy being Lex Luther was just a terrible joke too.  Iy was completely immersion breaking.  DC movies just dont actually feel fun to watch.  It always feels like I wasted my time.  &&was ok, but not great. and sure, it left room for future WW movies, but that doesn't really help the DCEU at all&&Meh, it was a standard comic book movie with a slightly different message.&&I'm so out of it, I read that as wonder wombat &&There's nothing wrong with a gritty story.

Instead,  the movie just said ""I guess the movie is set here now"",  even though really it doesnt make much sense,  nor does it even really serve to offer up any concrete information on any of the characters involved.  At the very least I thought Silva was going to acknowledge that M was indeed his mother (being cut loose shouldnt be a big deal for a spy)...   As a layman its very difficult to explain why a certain scene or act feels heavily altered or redacted,  but I definitely did get that feeling..   To use a simile instead,  It was like a 19th century log cabin filled with Ikea furniture.   it looks nice now I guess,  but you can just kinda tell something else used to belong there.&&I think it was just intentional design on Raimi’s part. Prior to that, he’s known for making a certain type of genre film. They feel campy and low budget, but fun. Spider-Man kept everything that made Darkman or the Evil Dead movies lovable. Since the genre wasn’t defined yet, and Sony had no significant interests in pursuing a series or a Spider-Verse at the time. Raimi made a movie for his fans, and for Spider-Man fans. And it was awesome.

At the time of the planning phases, they had quite literally approached him as “Oh, that guy who made Quick and the Dead - which made us a lot of money - is a Spider-Man fan. Maybe we give this project to him?”

He had carte blanche to make the movie in his image (for the first one, at least), until it started making money and Laura Ziskin/Avi Arad started to tighten the noose. I think Spider-Man 1 looking the way it does was 100% intentional.&&>The former creates vengeance, the latter changes hearts

(Those are totally real Marvel characters btw. I don't know what Ryan's North's on, but he should share).&&I want this as a film now&&That's just it though. Marvel heroes are by and large part of their societies. Extraordinary people, but basically still people with lives who happen to wear spandex on nights and weekends.  DC heroes by and large are not. They are outsiders by their nature, and gods by their strength.  
Marvel heroes do good because of their power. DC heroes do good in spite of it.

&&It first for Batman: he's trying to be Bruce Wayne because that's not who he really is: he's Batman. 

Aquaman and Wonder Woman being solely monarchs of their fantasy lands instead of maintaining secret identities is relatively new and really enphasized for the DCAU in part because they're so shitty and scatterbrained that they don't want to handle their struggles. &&Actually, it seems like the recent comics have changed Batman in a lot of ways. [His engagement to Selina Kyle definitely is revealing a different side to his character and how he's trying to be human and to be part of a functional relationship, despite not knowing how. I think that's trying to be human, though his persona of Bruce Wayne is still just an act.](#spoiler)

Can't really say much about Wonder Woman or Aquaman though. They tend to change with the writer. Though an issue about Aquaman that sort of deals with a lot of his superhero baggage comes to mind. It gets convoluted by the end though.

They killed Superman before they even united the Justice League.&&Just sucks that they are going to blow their load on the Flash's most iconic story before anybody really has a chance to give a shit about him in my opinion =/ suppose only time will tell.&&Basically, without spoiling too much, the Flash's mother is murdered by the Reverse Flash in the normal timeline. This kicks off a sequence of events that eventually leads to Barry Allen becoming the Flash. 

In Flashpoint BA decides to go back in time and save his mother, in so doing he creates a paradox (The Flashpoint Paradox) and he never becomes the Flash and the world is drastically different. Like Batman is not bothered by killing people, because it's Thomas Wayne not Bruce, because Bruce was the one murdered that night. And Aquaman and WW are baddies and trying to take over the world. Cool right?

No. Because this means rather than a Flash origin story we get a story where other heroes take notable roles and screentime, and the Flash doesn't even have powers for a major portion. Batman who is more violent loses all of its punch because this universe's Batman already fucking brands people with a bat symbol and paralyzes them on the reg. 

It's a fundamental lack of understanding by the filmmakers that Flashpoint is really a Justice League story with the Flash being a major character and catalyst, it's NOT a standalone Flash story.

So, they either focus on the Flash almost entirely leaving out the Wayne/Aquaman/Wonder Woman parts basically cutting out *everything* that was cool about the Flashpoint story in the first place (a la CW). OR They have all that stuff and make a really cool *Justice League* movie at the expense of the Flash getting a standalone film (way less likely than just butchering the story to make it fully Flash centric). Additionally, the likelihood of any standalone in the universe (let alone the FIRST movie for the character) getting the budget to justify all of the characters needed is unlikely to say the least.

Therefore, Flash fans will inevitably be disappointed. Either they lose the standalone featuring their favorite character that they were excited for and get another JL movie, or they get a butchered version of the Flashpoint story meaning they will never get to see one of the most iconic Flash catalyst events occurring on the big screen in this DCEU. 

There is just no winning. Bad choice of a first story and shows the fundamental lack of care going into the entire franchise. The only good thing that could come out of Flashpoint is an entire DCEU reboot which is also probably never going to happen.

TL;DR: Flashpoint is an iconic *Justice League* story and when they try and cram it into a standalone they will inevitably leave out all of the good bits or end up ignoring the Flash which is doing him dirty in the first Flash-centric movie we're supposed to get.&&I never knew squirrel girl had friends&&The best mistake is combining the two in only the second movie of the DCEU franchise. &&And yet somehow the guy whose power is basically ""survives anything"" gets taken out almost immediately in First Class.&&Can't beat the Hulk? Why not just gain the ability to teleport away!&&I was pissed that x-men first class movie killed him.&&That reminds of a post from r/gametales where one player had a hero like that and another person playing a villain tortured him with psychic powers causinh his body to adapt by removing all higher brain functions.&&[SCP-682](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682)&&Not red glowy balls of doom, apparently. &&[removed]&&Yea Cuz Whatsoever they do, Batman can still beat everyone's arse&&Flash is the prime example of that.&&> We don’t talk about

Everybody goes on and on about why Marvel movies are better than DC movies, for where DC goes wrong - but *this* is the reason.

Marvel has, since the beginning of the MCU, given the properties to directors who are *fans*, and let them tell the story they want to with minimum influence.

DC does the opposite. They’ve been trying to force this cinematic universe since day 1, and every step of the process comes down from the executive level. It’s these soulless creations that are curated heavily by out-of-touch people who are trying to force something that Marvel evolved organically. It doesn’t work.&&Don’t worry, he was back in the next movie, making the entire thing pointless.&&And thats the main reason i mostly hate Batman v superman&&They've already fucked it up. The whole reason why Barry goes back to save his mom in the first place is because there's a buildup to it as you learn of his history. Having Flashpoint be the first movie won't have the same impact, because the general audiences don't care about DCEU Barry.&&So I loved the CW flash and had expected them to use that Barry Allen. 

Why did they fuck it up by having multiple Flashs? Why not let the tv version be the only one? How is it they can do tv series just fine, but can't do movies? 

I'm asking you because you're a Flash fan, it's all very confusing me for me.&&That a was great summary, thank you&&Lmao tbh I thought she was just some superstrong weird loner girl that looks like  a squirrel.

But going off my gut instinct (which is not evidence)... I believe this one.  She's naming a very specific guy she worked with and shares a lot of details.  And the stunt coordinator isn't a Hollywood power broker, so she's not going to get a lot of mileage out of the accusation.

1. I will NEVER let my future children be around a 36-year-old man who wants to take my kid for a swim (creep much) and a “sushi” date. 

2. I will ALWAYS advocate for outspoken children; teach your kids to call adults on their creepy fuckin shit. I was raised by drug addicts and have been in some really terrible situations even younger than 12, and I always somehow had the fortitude to KNOW and ACT when i felt it wasn’t right. 

&&What I don’t understand, is why would she make these kinds of allegations, including using his name, if she weren’t telling the truth? I’m no lawyer so I don’t need to pretend that my brain and human emotions aren’t affecting how I read this situation. 

Kramer says outright this did not happen and says details of her story are incorrect (possible in both cases of her telling the truth and not, she was 12 which was a long time ago). Dushku says with pointed detail (mentioning the air conditioning, for example) that it happened and she even told someone else at the time who confronted him. I do feel her getting injured was probably coincidence, but how would I or anyone else be able to know now? 

Basically, to me he’s taking the very common absolute denial method which is always suspicious with such allegations, but it’s not like he has any other options whether it happened or not. She is using exact details of a situation that undoubtedly would have profoundly affected her (potentially forever) if true, going as far to name him, say exactly what he did, what she did to try and make him stop at the time and how she handled the situation afterwards. As a human being, it’s extremely difficult to believe that she isn’t telling the truth. &&If I remember correctly, Dushku was a young girl in ""True Lies"". And I really see no reason why she would make this up, esp a ""no named"" Hollywood type. And some of these men denying have a skewed reality. What they think is ""friendly"" is anything but. I believe her. &&Damn, sucks to hear that.

True Lies is one of the golden memories of my child and a Bill Paxton classic&&I believe that something like what she described happened to her. Events like that, especially at an early age, are very traumatic. 

Her going through that experience means she likely has PTSD. Her memory may be less than perfect due to this.

Most likely this happened to her, although exactly when and who did it we aren't sure of. 

I believe Hollywood has a massive pedophilia problem.

As a really little kid my parents were friends with Joel and his family. I stayed over a few times and hung out with his kid. Glad nothing happened to me or my sister.... weird seeing a name you personally know not having any connections to Hollywood. 

Edit: talking to my mom who knew him. She’s got some messed up stories that his ex wife (was his current wife at the time) shared with her. Totally believable accusations. &&As a father....I would never let my daughter hang with an adult male in which was not a closely trusted member of the family...Fucking idiotic parents.&&Wow. These comments just got to show you that we have a trial by media. I'm not saying I believe him and his response or believe her. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt until more evidence comes to light. If he's a predator there are probably more victims. But until more facts come to light I'm not picking up my pitchforks just yet. &&Wait, so she told her parents and brother about it and they decided the wisest course of action was to do nothing?

> Reached by phone Saturday morning, Kramer said he did not know of the post. But after TheWrap read him the post from beginning to end over the phone he said: “Wow. That’s news to me.  I never sexually assaulted her. She’s a sweet girl. We all looked out for her, that’s surprising.”

> “I’m just shocked,” Kramer said about the account. “I don’t know why she would say that. We took her out to dinner and we took her to our hotel for a swim at the pool.”

> “These are absolute lies,” Kramer said. “She said I took her home in a cab? I was the one who was driving the car. There were four or five of us in the car.”

> “I’m absolutely floored,” he said.  “I don’t know what to say. I Never took her to my hotel room. I never took off her clothes.”

> “I liked Eliza,” he said. “We took care of her. Nobody every called her ‘jailbait.'”
At one point Kramer scoffed at the details of the story, telling TheWrap: “That’s a pretty good memory. She could ruin my career.”
&&He says “She said I took her home in a cab? I was the one who was driving the car. There were four or five of us in the car.” That means there are other people who might be able to confirm or deny that aspect, although it has been over 23 years.&&Should have gone with- ""These accusations are True Lies"", what a missed opportunity.&&Does The Wrap not have an editor or are we encouraging 5th grade grammar and spelling mistakes?

.... the last one is unforgivable.&&Exactly. I can't believe some here don't seem to understand WHY people take so long to reveal this stuff. She fucking told people and no one did anything???? It's the usual story with this stuff. Just think of all the sexual abuse that went on in the church. How many children told people in power but got no help. People need to stop acting like it's shocking that someone would hold onto something like this until they thought they would be taken seriously &&Erm, you might invite the twelve year olds parents, but a kid on their own? Yeah, there's no non-paedo way to spin that.&&And how do the parents not Insist to be there...???&&May I play devils advocate?

3 years ago, me and my buddies would always go down to this shopping strip once a month just to hang out, shoot the shit, maybe go to dave and busters. One day while we were on the strip, I seen this young boy, maybe 13-14 years old sitting by hisself. Don't ask me what came over me at the time, but I asked if he was with his friends or parents in which he replied ""no, just me"". I felt so bad for some reason, I ended up inviting him to hang out with us (we were all in our young 20's). He had a blast! I told him I would drive him home, which I did, and he told me all about himself and thanked me so much for being so kind and generous. I dropped him off and never seen him again.

Kramer does say, it was a group of them. Trying to make her feel comfortable and welcomed in the work environment. So it might seem odd due to the allegations, but I myself wouldn't bat an eye if my daughter was going to a hotel with her colleagues for a swim in the hotel community pool. She was a child actress in an adult profession, I would hate to have to leave her out hanging out by herself just because it seems weird to others. &&According to the accounts, it was multiple people  who came over to swim, with her included. &&When my dad's friend French kissed me on a camping trip when I was 8, my mom's response was to call my friend's grandmother (she had custody because the dad was active duty military) and tell her I was uncomfortable around him and ask if she could let us know if he was going to be around when I was coming over. That was it. No one called the cops, and my parents didn't seem to believe me, even implying I was exaggerating about how creepy the kiss was. I didn't really have the terms to describe what happened but I was very clear that this was a mom-and-dad kiss, not a kiss you give a kid. 

It really fucked with me because my parents were generally over-reactors and it just didn't fucking understand why they wouldn't take my side on this. 

He continued to try shit every time he was around me, culminating in him shoving his hand down my pants and underwear during a water balloon fight when I was 16.  I just left the party and ended the friendship rather than telling an adult.

I still don't understand why my parents didn't have my back. &&Her mom replied to someone talking about her parents not doing enough [on her facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialElizaDushku/):

I accept your condemnation as Eliza's mother. No, it was not her career that I feared for, as that meant nothing to me. I was afraid of Joel Kramer, too. And it was years later that I finally understood fully what really happened. At the time, Eliza was too scared to tell the whole story and in a way I think she protected me from knowing because she knew how frightened I was of the powerful men on the set. Her lose was the worst, but abuse can throw a wide net. I only began to understand this many years later. Thank you to your mother for what she did for you. I wish I had been that brave.&&One adult did confront the guy. Eliza broke her ribs on a stunt gone wrong that day. That guy was responsible for her safety. &&I mean, my mom literally walked in on her husband molesting me and not only didn't take me and my sister and leave, but she made a point to leave me alone with him when he was in a bad mood. If people won't act on what they see with their own eyes, I'm not surprised they wouldn't act on what their kid tells them =/

On a bittersweet note, my sister and I are now adults and when my sister found out, she told our mom that *she* was also abused. This is the news that spurred my mom to leave him. Thanks, mom.&&Not uncommon. I got the same reaction because it was his word against mine so I was told by people who weren't present during the assaults that I must have misunderstood his actions and that he was just trying to be friendly. Yeah, he held me, a resisting young girl, down, and humped me with a hard on. Someone please explain how I misinterpreted that. The result was that my very well respected, greatly admired abuser got to carry on sexually assaulting me until I was old enough to get away from him without help from anyone. If he were still alive, I'd tell all his colleagues and friends exactly what he did even though I don't have a shred of proof. &&This is why more women don't come forward. They know either no one will believe them or that nothing will be done about it. 

I can't tell you how many women in my life were raped or molested as children, told an adult, and weren't believed. &&I'm surprised she actually named a person. Tbf, he's probably a no one in the grand scheme of things, but she named him.&&Yeah the whole concept of grooming is fucked up and creepy.&&In terms of something that both sides agree on it's that she went back with them to swim in the pool. She would've been 13 or 14 at the time. I don't know if that' 'normal' in Hollywood, but it's not normal for a bunch of adult men to hang out with a young teenage girl that they aren't related to or isn't a friend of their kids. &&its quite specific.  wtf.&&That might be the most important thing that's happening now - we're all getting a much better understanding of what this kind of behavior looks like. It's harder for a pedophile to groom a target if the target knows how to recognize what's happening. Hopefully, pedophiles will also have a much harder time getting away with public behavior like calling a twelve-year-old girl ""jailbait."" &&Typical grooming
&&Why would a stunt coordinator spend so much time with an actress in the first place? &&A pedophile.  

Edit: OP asked what kind of person would do this kind of thing to a 12 year old. Very confused about OP deleting his/her comment :/&&Didn't realize she was 12. Definitely should've been part of the headline.&&The industry that continues to sing the praises of Woody Allen and Roman Polanski to this day.  &&Reading her post made me physically ill.&&there are some sick fucks out there unfortunately &&It's not about what's appropriate, it's about what they think they can get away with.&&I get exhausted at the number of Reddit dudes who try and excuse sexualizing 13 year olds. &&The same shits on 4chan who have a ""countdown clock"" counting down to when their favorite kid celebrity turns 18.&&[removed]&&[removed]&&Ironic how big ""Spotlight"" was in Hollywood a few years ago. I wonder when the Hollywood sexual abuse movie is coming, if ever.&&Honesty my biggest worry about those stranger thing kids blowing up in a big way.&&Money and fame are the most important things in the world for a lot of people, they’d sell their souls for it&&The *world* is a cesspool. I dont think its any more prevalent in Hollywood than anywhere else in the US. We just hear of it more because potential victims can spread their message farther and wider. 

This is happening on your street, in your town, and maybe in your own family, or friend's familes. It's not Hollywood. This is everybody's problem.&&My fear is that people are going to think this is only limited to Hollywood, or that Hollywood is some particularly dark, cult-like arena where everyone's morality is warped beyond the bounds of normality. And while maybe the logistics and culture of film making does promote abuse beyond average, it's hardly a far cry from the country's culture overall. That's why the ""me too"" movement can and should resonate with us. This isn't a Hollywood problem; it's a societal problem. When I taught in a small rural high school, every year I'd find out (through various means) that ~10% of my students had been sexually abused at some point... and those were, of course, only the ones that I'd caught wind of. I don't think nearly 10% of Hollywood has come out yet, but I'm sure that the number easily meets or exceeds that... and it's not just because Hollywood is a cesspool. Hollywood is just a spotlit portion of America. &&I seriously doubt Hollywood is worse than anyplace else. The difference is that the abusers and victims tend to be famous. &&shithole*&&Yes. &&The correct response. &&My dad was in the film business, I've been on dozens of sets.

One commercial I was on, the talent (4 year old girl) showed up with her Spanish speaking nanny who was more interested in the craft services table than watching the kid.

Mom was with her 2 year old on another commercial out of town.

&&She's staking her reputation against his. The facts are not ""Stuntman Joel Kramer molested actrese Eliza Dushku when she was 12,"" the only known fact is ""Eliza Dushku says that when she was 12, stuntman Joel Kramer molested her."" Anyone who works with either of those people will have to choose who to believe. There's never going to be any proof either way. People will just have to make up their own minds about the situation.&&I'd say the issue is that it's almost impossible to prove molestation/rape/sexual assault unless there are actual witnesses. And against someone in a position of power, why would you risk losing your job by accusing them? I want due process, but I also want accusers to feel like they'll be believed, and I'm not cynical enough to believe that there are a huge amount of people out there evil enough to falsely accuse people for any reason, or no reason (at least, no more so than any other crime).  
  
 
I would also suggest people saying that the accused' life will be destroyed to consider that when publicly accusing somebody like this that the accused will likely face a lot of backlash from this, even if the accusations are true. It's very possible after this passes from today's news that nothing will happen to him and she'll get dozens of death threats and some of her family members will get doxxed. Most likely she'll walk out of this worse off than when she came out, regardless of what happens to him. I don't want a false accusation to ruin his life, but he's not the only one who's going to face reprocussions from this.&&I think (based on my own, non-Hollywood experience during the same era) that maybe for a long time we didn’t believe girls/women about this stuff, or we just didn’t act on it. Or our parents thought it would just be too hard to bring people to justice. So I’m going to listen to every woman who speaks out on this... maybe because I wish I could too.&&Agreed. I am of the belief and I could be wrong. That people need to proceed cautiously here, it can swing back the other way in a very strong way. This should be taken squarely to the authorities. If we just go by word, we're all going to be doomed in time, humans lie to. Not saying in this case, but you know where I'm going...&&Some of the top comments are immediately calling him a ""fucking pedophile"" and a ""dirtbag"". Can you imagine if the dude is innocent? His life is officially fucked. Who's going to want to associate with him now? He was a pedophile before he even uttered a response.

If it's true though, fuck him and I feel extremely sorry for Dushku.&&I hear you. At the same time, we have *always* been in a culture lacking in due process when it comes to this issue. As long as predominately female victims of sexual assault were the ones that had to leave jobs or even their industry in order to avoid the abuser or because the abuser was powerful enough to throw a monkey wrench into their career, we were perfectly OK with that status quo. It's only just now because *men's* jobs/careers are being threatened that we're suddenly concerned about male innocent victims. &&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&Well, there are hospital records for the broken ribs she got the same day an adult confronted him, and adults corroborated knowing what happened at the time. Her mother came out with a message acknowledging she didn't do more because she was also scared of him, but acknowledging that she should have. That's quite a lot that I can immediately think of, it it's very implausible to me that she orchestrated all of that stuff to screw the career of a guy she hasn't been in touch with since she was twelve.

&&Exactly. Recently one of our retired college professors was accused about sexual harassment in the 80s and turns out it was false and the accuser was mentally unstable (medical college so we arent just labelling people here,she was diagnosed) . He was one of the  best teachers we ever had in our college.There should be equal punishment when the accusers falsely claim like this.&&Agreed that there should be plenty if corroboration from her family she told at the time and from people on the set regarding the nickname of ""jailbait"" he is said to have used.  

But.

There's not really anyway to disprove these allegations though. The only way is if the accuser has a change of heart. 

And also why would an actress just go after a stunt coordinator if it weren't true? What possible motivation is there? 

&&Nah man, it's 2018. You only need accusations.&&>Already people wanting his head on a stick. Can we at least confirm he did it before ruining this man's life?


Does it matter either way? If you believe her,  never hire this guy as a stunt coordinator. If you believe him, never hire her as an actress in your film again.

And no, you can't confirm anything because she was 12. &&According to her Wiki page, she was addicted to drugs and alcohol starting when she was 14. Pretty close to this incident, it could've been a coping mechanism but hard to say. She has been 9 years sober according to Wiki. &&She's had drink and drug problems, which she fully admits to.&&Yep, she was 12.&&is there anything that they could do to him?

&&Funny how I have never once seen this opinion on anything Terry Crews' related, but it is always brought up when a woman is making the allegations.&&Care to share? &&Trusted family members are the most likely to do it, tho.&&Sadly, most abuse is perpetrated by family members and close friends of the family.

I think instead of fearing any and all men, we should be teaching children about sexuality much sooner and explain to them that this type of behavior is not acceptable; and that they should never be afraid to say ""no"". 

Most of these cases involving children depend upon the victim's ignorance of what's really going on and/or fear of reprisal. Let's start being honest with kids first.&&Copied from a comment above:



From a thread blaming her mom/dad on FB this am - her mom responded. This is her answer verbatim ---

When I was choked by someone a decade later, it was my word against his, and I didn't bother reporting it because who would believe me?

Rose McGowan seemed to have no issues [working](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_Lane) with a [director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva) who: 

* Fucked a 12 year old boy
* Filmed one of the fuckings
* Was caught and sentenced to 36 months in prison, and he served 15 months

Stars who worked with Salva after he raped this boy:

* Lance Henriksen (Twice)
* Eric Roberts
* Mary Steenburgen
* Sean Patrick Flannery
* Jeff Goldblum
* Dean Stockwell
* James Remar
* Justin Long
* Eileen Brennan
* Ray Wise (Twice) 
* Gina Philips (Twice)

All these stars are hypocrites.  All of them.  They don't even care if you FUCK A 12 YEAR OLD BOY AND FILM IT. As long as their career is advanced, all is well.

But that's none of my business (kermit.png)&&> I remember how he laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.

When he was ‘finished’, he suggested, “I think we should be careful…,” [about telling anyone] he meant. I was 12, he was 36.

>I remember how afterwards, the taxi driver stared at me in the rear view mirror when Joel Kramer put me on his lap in the backseat and clutched me and grew aroused again; and how my eyes never left the driver’s eyes during that long ride over a Miami bridge, back to my hotel and parent.

At least one of those passengers should be decent enough to step forward and say that they were there and nothing happened.

I made a throwaway to respond to you because I got a crazy text from an unknown number last week accusing me by name of being involved with their underage daughter and telling me to call them. 

now here's the thing. I work from home, I don't really go out. I barely leave my apartment. I haven't dated anyone in like 2 years (I remember cause it was a tinder hookup after new years the year before last and she was in college and definitely nowhere close to being underage) and have no idea who this person could be or what they're talking about. 

I've pretty much come to terms with it being some scam (someone got my name and number, it wouldn't be hard) and decided to do this and maybe blackmail me into paying if I call? 

I'm thinking maybe their hope is if they target enough guys 1 of them will think ""oh shit was that girl 18"" and call.

regardless I'm 100% positive I have nothing going on with anyone let alone someone underage so it was pretty fucking terrifying to get that text.  so to answer your question. I ***CAN*** imagine it. and its fucking terrifying.

&&> I'm not saying she's lying, but can you imagine being 100% innocent and someone accuses you like this. Cuz what can you do, of course you'll deny it but that's exactly what a molester would say!

Edit:  I am not sure what’s up with the downvotes. I am not suggesting it didn’t happen. I am asking where were the responsible adults who failed a 12 year old child. &&That can't be healthy in long term.&&Predator until proven prey.&&[You can't say hi to kids anymore.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc--FjGgAig&t=0m33s)&&As a man especially yeah. My partner works in childcare and will point at a kid in public and say ""look how cute that kid is"". No way I'm looking and no way I'm saying anything. It's different coming from a man, I don't know why but it is. &&I think the sad reality is that so many people just two generations ago WERE assaulted by “their creepy uncle” or their friend’s parent, or their parishioners, or their teacher etc. etc. and for a long time everyone just looked the other way.

Now people are looking at it and we’re finding that it’s terrifyingly prevalent. We have our own kids and our reaction is to fear, mistrust, and bubble wrap. That instinct isn’t completely wrong, (though it has many disadvantages) because we haven’t figured out how to properly handle the mass of abusers that are out there. We haven’t figured out why so many people get off on abusing positions of power. We don’t seem to be ready to examine what it is about us as a species or society that encourages this behaviour, so we fear it, pretend it doesn’t exist, and blame the victims for it’s occurrence. Maybe it’s because when we examine our own sexual behaviour it’s too uncomfortable? 

It evokes strong reactions and opinions in everyone to different ends and for different reasons. 

I’m an educator and false accusations by kids do happen. I live in a perpetual state of awareness that this could happen to me. Sometimes kids do it because they are mad about being held accountable for their behaviour. 

We all (male and female educators) operate very carefully in schools because again, there are educators who have in the past and are currently abusing kids. It’s awful. Thankfully they often do get caught and fired, but it is real. 

False accusations are shitty, and can ruin careers, but what is the alternative? The children who are actually being assaulted need to be protected, and I for one am completely fine following some careful rules about never being alone with students, never shutting a door when I’m with a small group of students. Students are never in my car, and when I do have to have a serious conversation, there is always more than one adult present. 

If those of us who are healthy, non-abusers do our due diligence to protect ourselves from false accusations I am of the opinion that we are indirectly protecting kids from would-be abusers who cross those boundaries. When they cross those boundaries it hopefully seems strange to the kid, raises a huge red flag, perhaps allowing them time to get out of the situation.

So when you’re feeling sad about having to set personal boundaries around your kids’ friends, remember that it’s because for a long time predators went largely unchecked, and they were often in positions close to their victims (family, family friends, school, church etc.). This new way of being is a reaction to those predators. 

What is sad is that the predators exist(ed) at all. 

I have hope though that one day we will handle all of this better and that we’ll be able to achieve reducing the rates of abuse. I’m not sure how or when, but I believe that talking about it is a crucial step.

Because that is the trend on reddit right now, go into basically any thread about this topic, and you'll people regurgitate the same type comment over and over again, but never adding any new information.  It is weird though that people seem to resent Meryl Streep more than the actual abusers themselves, like literally any time Louis CK is mentioned people come to his defences by reminding us that the ""only"" sexually harassed his coworkers... yet Meryl Streep is demonised. 

I think the list is a great example though, because people in this sub doesn't really regard her all that highly so they have no problems singling her out, but they don't want go after Aronofsky or Lynch because they're popular here.

In my experience, the parents who want their kids to make it big in the show business are usually loony fucking people.  They're quick to trust people and will do ANYTHING to get in the next big commercial/movie.  If I had a kid who was in the show business I'd be there, on set, every day that they're working.

Finally, some stats. Every 98 seconds, another american is sexually assaulted. 321,500 (ages 12 and older) are victims of sexual assault each year. Most of these cases go unreported (It is estimated only about 16% of rapes are reported). Less than half of those arrested for rape are convicted, 54% of all rape prosecutions end in either dismissal or acquittal. The conviction rate for those arrested for murder is 69% and all other felons is 54%. (The Response to Rape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice) 21% of convicted rapists are never sentenced to jail or prison time, and 24% receive time in local jail which means that they spend an average of less than 11 months behind bars.

The incidences of fabricated rape claims is 2-3% which is the same number for the average crime. 

People don't understand how hard it is for victims of sexual abuse to even talk about their experience once, much less be dragged into courtrooms and yelled at by a defense attorney. Made to relive the experience over and over and over just to end with the person often being acquitted or found guilty, but sentenced to no jail time. People come forward with their stories and are dragged through the mud, called liars, insulted, etc. And then we wonder why more women haven't come forward.&&[removed]&&[removed]&&Was there no statute of limitations in 1994?

Sadly it was a horrible time in American history, and as far as I'm concerned its effects on the society are never going to go away. 

Whats even worse, is that this hysteria destroyed so many lives in the 80's and 90's. Probably one of the most well known ones is [the Kellers.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-release/texas-frees-daycare-operator-accused-of-satanic-sexual-abuse-idUSBRE9AQ13R20131127) but its happened to [a significant portion of people](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-release/texas-frees-daycare-operator-accused-of-satanic-sexual-abuse-idUSBRE9AQ13R20131127) And I'm not saying that people shouldn't speak up, or that Dushku is lying or anything like that, but a lot of the so called movements in the passed year or so kinda reek of this hysterical panic, and if history is any teacher we should tread very carefully. &&Screw that, I refuse to live in fear.

I once saved an entire photoshoot. I was walking through the park, and some parents were trying to get a shot lying in the grass with their baby, but he was squirming and crying. I snuck up behind the photographer and goofed off. The kid looked right toward the camera and started giggling. The parents thanked me, the photographer looked startled, and I went on with my day, totally unarrested.

Psychos do it to manipulate the other person into action. &&>generally just by being themselves

That's pretty much bullshit. Sure, there are exceptions, but most of us act very much differently depending on the group we're interacting with (be it family, close friends, acquaintances, colleagues etc).

e: personally I can say that I'm being myself when I'm by myself. When I'm with my best friends it gets pretty close to that tho &&This. If you pay close attention you realize that nothing is authentic only a means to another end. They fake sadness and crying and most people will act to make them feel better. They fake anger and most people will act to make them feel better. They fake disinterest and most people will act to make them feel better. They fake trustworthiness and most people will trust them. They fake kindness and most people will trust them. In a fucked up way, its society's fault because there's this emphasis on performance, someone gives you a gift, you don't like it but you have to act. Someone talks to you and you don't want to and aren't interested but you have to act. Asshole dies/gets what they deserve and you have to act. Hate your job and coworkers, you have to act. Depressed and suicidal, you have to act. We're all actors or most of us at least, I'm starting to think the only difference is they understand that whereas most think they're actually happy all the time or they're really sad because they smile or cry. Too much its just ""I've been conditioned to think x is happiness and so I have x and I'm happy or I don't have x so I'm sad."" As a black woman, I think white women have largely mastered this behavior. Its so obvious when another woman is playing the victim and being manipulative. I also see it with incel, forever alones quite often. Its crazy, I no longer think its as simple as normal vs psycho, our society creates these roles and people have to perform them. Quite like if you go somewhere like Argentina, in the larger cities people just seem to be performing, attempting to fit themselves into some ""Italian, white, european"" role even if it doesn't fit, its like they're caricatures of themself, you can tell its not deep or who they really are. 

There's this negging that PUA do and its to manipulate you into gaining their approval. 

There's this thing tantrums that children do and its to manipulate you into giving them what they want. 

There's this thing ads that companies do to manipulate you to buy things.

Unfortunately, people can't act directly or overtly so they operate indirectly, covertly, or subliminally to get their way. For some time subliminal was preferred and people skilled at that were pushed to success. At this point, people are waking up and taking everything at face value so directness is coming back into fashion. &&""oh I get it, so it's like when someone eats too much chocolate cake?

Parents chaperone their kids to set under normal circumstances. This (if true) was obviously an abnormal situation. 

If the pretense wasn't a solitary thing, would you be more inclined to allow a child to go out with friends? What if there an assurance that a person's wife was going to be there, or a few adults, etc, other kids? 

If the person that told you all that was someone you had known and worked with for months and trusted?

That is what grooming is, they build up a false trust by lying and hiding who they are and then suddenly once they feel that they are at the too trusted to be caught stage they do a 180 and become themselves.&&As a parent, I pay a guy to come over and be at my house with my kids without me there.  Trusting men with children and not expecting them to rape your children isn't some kind of crime.  GTFO.

Edit: Sorry for the GTFO but as a stay-at-home dad I am especially sensitive to the idea that men cannot be trusted with children and leaving children alone with grown men is some kind of no-no.  The idea that children should not be put in a position where they might be alone with a man because 'what do you expect to happen?' or some shit is just gut wrenching to me.

When I was a kid my parents let me wander the neighborhoods playing with my friends. Just had to be home by dinner. Nowadays you hardly ever see kids playing outside unless an adult is with them and they sure as hell don’t wander past the little square of grass that is their front yard. 

I try not to do that with my kids but I admit, with the 24/7 news cycle of horrible stories it’s difficult to not be overprotective. &&yeah, it was a goddarn shame she didn't continue to act. she was really good. &&>  and another man stating he doesn’t even look at children in public

My sexual assault was being groped without my consent while friends sat nearby totally oblivious to it. No physical violence. Still disgusting and violating.&&I'm split on the issue. I had a cousin claim that my father groped her at a family reunion during a bonfire. Batshit crazy claim because everyone was in eyesight of each other, and was later proved in court to have never happened. 

A decade goes by, and a close family friend of ours from church claimed that my father ""sexually assaulted"" her in his doctor's office during an exam. Sued my father in a civil case after the criminal trial resulted in not guilty verdict. The woman knew about this incident from before and exploited it for her gain. I have a really hard time giving the accuser the benefit of the doubt based on my personal experience with how destructive these claims can be. It nearly ruined my father's career even though there wasn't evidence that he had done anything wrong. That is some bullshit. &&>I'm pointing out that she might not even be able to due to the length of time that has passed.

That and, how are you supposed to prove it? Even if it happened yesterday. Say he grabs your ass or feels you up. Did you catch it on video? Do you have a witness? No? Then there is no proof. Similar to how he can't prove her wrong. The very nature of these problems is that it going to be he said/ she said 90% of the time. &&I think the whole point of this movement is to show that these things are STILL happening, and to encourage the victims of today to report while
the law can still do something about it. 

Statute of limitations exists for good reason, but also we as a society should know that misconduct was happening behind the scenes. People like Weinstein will sink because it’s 1 vs Many, but 1 vs 1 cases shouldn’t ruin someone’s career.&&If you can prove they’re wrong, and that they know they’re wrong. Basically unless she admits she’s lying there’s not any way to respond, if he’s innocent.&&You can sue anybody over anything, just need the right lawyer&&I believe so, but you'd need proof that the accuser knowingly made false accusations as opposed to thinking they were actually assaulted or molested&&It is worse than this. If they are lying and make accusations against you first your career is ruined. If the state decides to pursue criminal charges it is prosecuted at the expense of the state not the accuser. You as the accused need to lawyer the fuck up at your own expense to defend against the charges. Say after a few months and all of your money the accuser says she misremembered, case dropped. Your career is dead and you are in debt from lawyers fees. Your only recourse is to sue the accuser, you do this at your own cost as it is a civil suit, again you will need lots of money for this. Turns out you can only win this if you can prove they are lying which is very hard to do. So you likely lose.

So here you are with no career, everyone thinks you are a monster and no money with tonnes of debt. Because of an allegation. I was a professional sports coach working with kids and it was fucking scary.&&Hard to prove a negative. You'd have to go on what would be pretty spotty recollections of others that might have been at this supposed pool party. Who is going to be able to provide an alibi for a 10 or 15 minute stretch of time of something that happened years ago. I can barely remember with accuracy what I had for breakfast a week ago.
&&Try proving you *didn't* do something decades ago. &&No, he'd have to proof that she knowingly made a false accusation. If she actually thinks she was assaulted or molested it's not slander even if the accusation is proven wrong since she didn't knowingly lie.&&But he’d also have to prove it never happened, which is going to be very hard for something that happened that long ago in a room with only 2 people.&&Also virtually impossible to prove slander. 

Even if she eventually admits she must have remembered incorrectly, because some evidence comes out proving it, she didn't know that when she made the accusation so no slander.  &&I think it’s fair to hold judgement because there are two sides to every story. Hell, when the Cosby stuff started coming out I was devastated because I was such a big fan. Given time to process and when more and more evidence started piling up now I’m just disgusted and sad for his victims. 

I also think that anybody who has suffered something as traumatic as being sexually molested/assaulted at a young age gains nothing but more trauma from reliving it when you speak about it publicly. The attention is not enjoyable. You get blamed for ruining someone’s career, you get questioned for what part you had in the assault, you get examined for evidence of a history of dishonesty... 

Why would anybody who DIDN’T get assaulted want to go through that? As you said, nobody’s career is getting rebooted for making a public accusation. &&So I kicked her in the pussy.&&> Screen fades

Like most of the time they don't allow them to be flipped and can never, ever catch fire. Yet here you have a sports car flipping 7 times just by jerking the steering wheel on a straight, something that would never happened in real life and that took a fucking cannon to achieve, and the car company is just fine with it.&&Well thats some sort of advertising i guess&&I remember reading about this scene after the movie came out. The DBS was so new that they didn't have time to make a stripped-down stunt car. They used the production model with added safety gear. They trashed four brand-new $300k+ cars for that one scene.&&So Aston was okay with them showing their car, which can't even be flipped by a ramp, being flipped by simply avoiding an obstacle? 

And yet, I can't buy a video game where a licensed car can be even remotely realistic destroyed. &&If I recall correctly, they didn't use real DBS's for the stunt scenes. They used DB9's modified to look like the pricier DBS. Also, one of cars that got dumped into a lake in QOS got sold for $350k, which was over $100k more than a brand new DBS.&&Huh. I thought the gas cannon was standard procedure for these kinds of rolls.
I guess they want to use less artificial methods sometimes. Good to know.
Also, bloody love this film. When it comes to Bond films (which I love) this is perfectly set out from beginning to end.&&The Falcon Interceptor roll at the beginning of Fury Road broke that record. 

Edit. Slightly different flip mechanism, and I think one less roll. Still impressive for in sand. &&All I see, is a Ford Fusion. Sighhhhhh&&So what your saying is Hammond couldn't have wrecked it then?&&If they wanted it to flip that badly, they should have just used Firestone tires on it.&&That was an expensive bit of film.&&Corners like it’s on rails. &&this sounds like it could be a good advertisement for aston martin&&Probably said already, but Spectre actually holds the record for largest stunt explosion caught on film, when the villains lair was destroyed. 

http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/11/daniel-craig-accepts-certificate-for-largest-film-stunt-explosion-in-latest-bond-405307&&I saw that DBS when I picked my V8 Vantage up from the factory a few years back.

Here is my Aston on the day I got it - https://imgur.com/q153b6J&&I loved the look of that car.. loved the dash.  Was so excited for the gadget and the chase scene.. defibrillator and immediate car crash.... I still like CR tho&&I wonder how hard the Aston engineers cheered when they heard this.&&As a car guy that scene always drove me crazy because I knew that car would react so much better IRL&&Same with Audi R8 in first Ironman movie&&Favorite bond book of all time. I still find it terribly sweet on how sad Bond felt ashamed that he couldn’t properly appreciate Vespers beauty with an erection when she entered his hospital room after his testicle torture.&&Once you get it goin..&&r/accidentalsuccess&&What a great job to have! Some next level motherfucker was like a cannon... A gas cannon!&&So...that means that if you had to avoid something at high speed like in the movie, the DBS wouldn’t flip at all?&&Richard Hammond did it all by himself. &&The guys over at Top Gear are already thinking of ways to get their record back&&‘Instead of increasing the ramp height, they attached a rocket to the side of the car’

That’ll work.&&It wasn't really a chase. He's speeding down a dark highway when Eva gets shoved onto the road in front of him. It forces him to swerve sharply and roll....a lot.&&This all took place on the 'Alpine Circuit' at Millbrook, which I've had the pleasure of driving a Rapide and Vanquish S around. Needless to say it was incredible, and Aston Martin do make really special cars. 
The following event was driving the DB11 around the high speed banked ring, and taking the Vantage V12 and the Vanquish S again, on the drag strip. A day I'll never forget!&&Cool. Nothing beats Smokey and the Bandit for too much help lol&&Going from crashing your Aston Martin to getting your balls whipped. Just the life of the world’s top spy. &&Not really, he was shaken, but not stirred.&&Any reports on the injuries he sustained?

**Edit**: I asked because I couldn't believe he wouldn't have used a stunt driver, Silly me. Bond = fictional. Daniel = real. &&And that wasn’t even the worst part of his night. &&[I just watched that scene again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CDKLMiTGY) Jesus Christ, it looks like a toy just spinning and rolling. A car weighs hundreds of pounds, at the least. That's several times your body weight, spinning about like dice with a fleshy bag of meat inside it. I've only ever been in one bad-ish wreck, and everybody walked away except my car. 

That had me kinda fucked up for a little while just knowing how easy it is to die in one of those fuckers. I never understood until then how some people freak out when someone else drives. I'm fine now, but for a good month or so I was a little antsy when other people drove and sometimes drove really (excessively) carefully.

On the bright side, that scene could *not* have been shot better. The last little bit where the car is juuuuust about to tip really tops it off.&&It was actually Jeb behind the wheels. [Same result, however.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnW0SeWxJRQ)&&The mythbusters strat&&[Mother nature just pissed her pantsuit!](https://youtu.be/EM7fP481SSo)&&I was just about to say this^ It was so brutal, I couldn't blink. The lighting and setting were beautiful and it actually made me feel sorry for Bond. I've watched a lot of older Bond movies, it was very rare that I was like ""oh no.. oh you poor bastard."" That crash was a movie moment I'll never forget.&&I wasn’t expecting it all either. I’d seen plenty of incredible car chases in the franchise and was expecting another, but the director was just like “fuck you, we’re gonna do something new and inventive.”&&I need to rewatch this movie.  I literally don't remember a car chase sequence, but I remember everything else (maybe).  
  
I love this film too..&&To me it was the saddest scene in the entire franchise. A car that beautiful being destroyed.&&[deleted]&&My favorite car crash scene will always be towards the end of Blues Brothers. So many cars...&&I love how they didn't cut away. It's just one continuous shot for ~10 seconds, if I remember correctly.

Compare that to Quantum of Solace, whose opening car chase has like 150 cuts in the space of 90 seconds. The quick editing is the main reason I can't stand that movie.&&Excellent movie. I was just happy it didn't have ridiculous stunts like the later Brosnan ones. 

I still love Goldeneye because of the game.&&And the darker era is basically a return to the Dalton era.  Highly recommended if you haven't seen them &&Kick ass bond theme as well&&I love it because it revamped something we never saw before. Bonds motivation. Before we just assumed honor, duty, hot women, and queen and country motivated Bond.

In the new one we see Bond truly. He’s strong, fast intelligent, and smooth. But deep down inside, he’s still just a petulant little boy. Somehow, through a long, illustrious career, he’s convinced Her Majesty to bank roll his life long endeavor of pushing playground bullies off of the top of the slide.

When he murders the bomb maker, he says it’s better to have one less bomb maker in the world, but you can tell Bond *wanted* to put him down. 

The look on his face when he stares the terrorist in the eye as the bomb goes off on his hip is so private and personal that you know Bond truly enjoyed that. He wouldn’t have had it any other way.

Even against Le Chifre. He wants to take everything from him. He wants him to be in danger and for his life to be worthless. He wants his long lucrative career to end right there and then.

Bond is just a villain working for the good guys, and it makes everything else he goes through make sense. He doesn’t withstand torture because he refuses to crack. He wanted to be the immovable object to the unstoppable force. He wants to torture Le Chifre with the fact that, even now with Bond in his clutches, his best laid plans mean absolute fuck-all.

Daniel Craig will always be my Bond.

&&It made for a scene that epitomised the lackadaisical approach to continuity and the huge amount of plot holes in those new bond movies. It's spectacular, but careless film making.

The bad guys get into Bentleys and drive away. Bond gives chase in an Aston Martin. Now we know Bond is a trained to drive at high speeds, and while Bentleys can be deceptively quick...they aren't outrunning an DB9, even if they had equally good drivers, which is unlikely.

Now in a couple of cuts we see all three cars in one scene. It is quite clear that Bond is no more than 6 or 7 seconds behind and surely gaining ground.

Several corners later Bond crests a hill and Vespa is in the road. HOW? Even if Bond failed to close the gap at all, we get a shot of Vespa from the front showing a clear 20-30m stretch of road with no cars on it. So what the fuck happened? Are you trying to tell me a Bentley managed to stop from 100mph, drop off a passenger and then clear the next bend in 6 seconds? It's ludicrous.

But hey, lets ignore that massive continuity error and assume they just lobbed her out of the car without stopping and Vespa has some hitherto unmentioned super power that allows to slide along asphalt at 60mph without a hair getting out of place. Her hands and feet are bound, but she's clearly not dazed and has had enough time to assess her situation, she knows she's in danger, or she wouldn't be frantically struggling with her bonds (James bonds).

Now I want you to answer this next question with the first thing that comes into your head. Your hands and feet are bound, you're lying in the middle of a road, you hear a car coming. What do you do? You have 7 seconds, (or longer as Bond seems to have somehow managed to lose ground on a luxury sedan full of people).

Your answer is roll out of the way isn't it? Because fucking obviously.

I'm sorry...great action scenes...fucking stupid movie. But hey, at least it wasn't the utter absurdity of Javier Bardem's super natural ability to predict the future that would be required to pull off his ""plan"" in Skyfall.

Edit - Anyone downvoting me, feel free to tell me what I got wrong. I'd love to hear you try and explain this scene in a way that makes ANY sense. It's just awful. People go on about how great that car crash is, but quite honestly the first time I saw the movie the car crash barely registered for me because I was completely distracted thinking ""Wait...what the fuck just happened?""&&I just watched this on an airplane yesterday.

It only flips 5.5 times though&&That's not a nice thing to call the one who bought you into this world. &&I just chose to assume he slid sideways into a pothole. It isn't just high performance cars which are roll resistant, either - most factory cars (excluding lifted off-road  vehicles) lack the grip to transition from a slide into a roll unless they are 'tripped' by something. It is a core part of testing to be certified in most countries, at least in the EU and Australia. The USA seems to get away with a bit less strict requirements.

Even for a larger SUV it takes a lot to actually get it to roll. Have a look at the angles that they start at in rollover crash tests such as [this XC90](https://youtu.be/D6CzLZsN3Z0?t=88).&&> Almost all high performance car would not flip like this no matter how hard you brake and pull the wheel

 I think that has to be Spectre, this scene: https://youtu.be/gKOq-AqPF5Q?t=497

 It's the only Craig movie in which an Aston ended up in water.

-Sobs-&&I'm a Bond fanatic...love them all....actually just finished my somewhat annual Bond marathon. And while some Bond things are far from ""realisitic, this was one thing that should have been.

But yes, this annoys the shit out of me....swerving on a wet road, regardless of his speed, would not roll the car like that. it would likely just understeer off the road, or end up spinning. No way in hell would it ""bite"" into the road like that and roll.

&&This scene took a minute to get over because it made no sense. A regular sedan wouldn't flip on dry pavement, but somehow a sports car flipped on wet? For the next minute or so I was trying to figure out if I had missed something.

Plenty of things make sense to exaggerate, but basic driving stuff like this is going to confuse a lot of people.&&Nice to see some sense in this thread. This crash was way too unrealistic even for a movie &&Definitely the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in a Bond film.&&THANK you. That has annoyed me since the film came out. The whole point of sports cars is that they have a huge engine AND a low center of gravity. Even though they actually flipped a real car it just looks so fake. &&I'm surprised everyone here likes that scene so much. I roll my eyes every time I see it because it's so unrealistic for a car to roll like that. Hitting an embankment or ditch would have looked way more plausible.&&That's because he swerved at a Bond level&&How about how the Chicago Nazis crash
&&Goldeneye is my favourite Bond film. I never played the game as a kid, I just loved everything about the film from the bungee jump at the beginning to the big finale at the end. Plus Sean Bean is in it and he’s a Sheffielder like me. :-)&&IIRC, Brosnan shared that sentiment when he was interviewed for the 50 year anniversary thing. Said something like he knew he had to move on when he's doing stuff like windsurfing the wake of a glacier.&&Dalton's run was a  strange one. His films definitely were a lot grittier but there was also the Moore hangover to contend with, with all the jokes and smarminess that went with it. 

 Though I do enjoy his two films and I thought he suited the role quite well.

 Plus Robert Davi was an excellent villain.&&Dalton is probably the closest actor physically to how Bond is portrayed in the books. 
Unfortunately the movies suffered terribly from a case of the 80’s.&&This explains why I don’t like the new bonds, also not a huge fan of the dalton era.&&I always loved that scene but never really thought about it. You're right though.&&only thing i can pick apart - if you're completely tied up, it's pretty hard to roll yourself aroud since you don't have the range of motion to get yourself moving. Otherwise every other point is solid.&&So much envy for your MPG ...&&This is gonna be the case for a lot of high-end sports cars, since they’re designed to be able to turn at high speeds. Wide wheel base, low center of gravity and aerodynamics that produce a lot of downforce all make a car pretty hard to roll just by turning. &&Don’t drive an SUV ever, go with a sedan &&For a cheaper option, a Mini Cooper or Cooper S (not the large Countryman models) might be more in your price range. The Cooper is a small, boxy car with a low center of gravity and wide wheel base, which makes it much harder to roll than most other cars. This general design came from Mini wanting to make a car very good at rally racing, where rolling is a very real concern, but dirt road performance is just as important.

Sports cars generally also have this advantage in regards to rolling by being low to the ground in order to take turns at higher speeds, but can be more expensive to maintain and insure, and if you live in an area with lots of speed bumps or uneven roads, the underside of a sports car May bump and scrape along the ground more than one would like.

If neither of these options sound good, the only other advice I could possibly give is to avoid SUVs as much as you can. These cars tend to sit higher on their wheels and are more top-heavy, meaning they're easier to roll. Sedans are lower to the ground, so they don't roll as easily.

Edit: oh and one last thing: The [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings), which does the safety ratings for cars, does specific safety ratings for rollover crashes as well as other types of crashes. If you're in the market for a car it is very worthwhile to check what the ratings mean and how cars you look at performed in these tests.&&*insert Top Gear Reliant Robin episode*&&He's wearing the strongest plot armor known to man. &&I mean I'm assuming its armored, because it's Bond's car.&&It's an Aston.

Wait...&&Dude, go carts weigh almost next to nothing. Your body weight shifting affects the stability of something that small. Full size cars are completely different. &&Except that unless you substantially weight that go kart, a driver can weigh more than the go cart.

as a result the go karts stability and centre of gravity are dependent on the weight and sitting height of the person in the vehicle.

With a normal car, the weight differential between occupants and the vehicle means they have a far lower effect.

----

However with a van, if the load isn't centred(Which they never are for obvious reasons) combined with the driver you can often change it enough that it's already on a tilt.

""Bond automatically slammed the brakes full on and braced all his sinews against the wheel to correct the inevitable slew to the left, but he only kept control for a split second. As the rubber was flayed from his offside wheels and the rims for an instant tore up the tarmac, the heavy car whirled across the road in a tearing dry skid, slammed the left bank with a crash that knocked Bond out of the driving seat on to the floor, and then, facing back up the road, it reared slowly up, its front wheels spinning and its great headlights searching the sky.

Gotta track down a bluray quick.  I can't live having forgotten any part of that fantastic film.&&Are you talking about when it got shot up by the helicopter, or when it blew up?

Not to mention the movie was probably one of the best Bond films in the franchise. Goldeneye for N64 paved the way for major FPS ""Medal of Honor, Battle Front, Halo etc.&&And while it has its flashy moments, nothing is quite as insanely over the top as the later films.&&GoldenEye is a perfect movie. And that Tank scene! The Bond theme blares! It's so good!&&You should try rewatching those new Bond movies, stop focusing on the ridiculous frenetic camera work in the action scenes and think about what is actually happening. I swear to god, I would say a good 50% of each sequence has as severe continuity errors as that car crash scene.

Skyfall's plot is like a fucking colander. For transparency, I just googled this list because I couldn't really remember what bugged me about it so much about Bardem's ""plan"". It requires the following, completely out of his control, things to happen

1.    Needed Patrice to die at the hands of MI6
2.    Needed to make sure Patrice would have his Macao casino chip in his coat
3.    Assumed James Bond would just go to the casino after finding the chip because where the fuck do you want a better clue to the hideout of a villain than to assume the farfetched notion that assassins enjoy the thrills of gambling risks
4.    Assumed James Bond would find his girl, Sévérine, and proceed to not get killed by her 3 body-guards
5.    Assumed Sévérine would like James Bond and offer him to join her on that boat for some shower-sex based on her secret desire to find a man strong enough to kill Silva
6.    Assumed James Bond would be wearing a tracking device to the island so MI6 could send a few choppers to arrest him
7.    Assumed his guards would not search Bond for aforementioned tracking device OR assume none of his guards cared about getting caught by MI6
8.   Assumed the MI6 nerds would hook-up his virulent computer to their mainframe instead of an isolated server
9.   Assumed there would not be mechanical locks to his cell - even though they were in an underground WW-2 bunker.
10. Assumed that whatever make shift, top secret place M managed to come up with at the last minute to put him would just happen to be close enough to the court house for him to be able to get there from where ever he was.
11. Assumed that whatever preset time and date he had set up to free him would just happen to do it at exactly the right time for him to escape when M is on trial 

That's not a plan...that's a series of coincidences he had nothing to do with. Yet the movie plays it off like he's a genius for coming up with it. And don't get me started on that fucking running to Scotland crap...some of the dumbest writing in movie history.&&Yeah, and if it showed her struggling and failing to roll out of the way in time the scene might have made a tiny bit more sense.

Look at how many BMW M3's were wrecked by Tom Cruise (no stunt driver) while filming MI5. M3's that weren't even available to the public yet, and he got to trash about a dozen of them. Although IIRC, some were actually 328i's in an M3 body.&&You should read the article, the real story is even cooler. &&Those were DB9 prototypes that were set to be scrapped anyway, so it's not as if they were custom-built for stunt work.&&IIRC the DVD commentary said it was just a shell of a DB9 on a normal car.

I spent a day there with CAT Driver Training in my E46 M3 and it was hands down one of the best days of my life. I learned so much about my car’s abilities and my own and today I’m a safer driver and get much more enjoyment in my daily driving because of what they taught me. Things like the chance to safely compare emergency stop distances at 70mph vs 100, finding the car’s limits and mine.... the Alpine track was the highlight of course but the whole day was incredible.  It was expensive, but worth every penny!  &&I started listening to the whole series on Audible when some of the Bond books became available on Kindle Unlimited. I've been tremendously impressed with the quality of the writing, given the genre. In the interviews with the narrators at the end, they seem to share this feeling. As you pointed out, Flemming was especially gifted at describing his scenes so that the reader could be fully immersed. Would be interesting to see them align the movie franchise to be more true to the original source material.&&> I mean, if you are watching trailers ~~expecting anything but spoilers~~ you are doing it wrong

FTFY.

Instead, skim-read the Wikipedia *Reception* section for a movie. It's a surprisingly good rough guide to movie quality, and never spoiler-ey.&&I wonder how much of the sound was from the actual wreck.&&Except for the lack of deployed airbags.&&The last bit entering the garage makes me think of GTA when you roll up your totalled car only to have it fixed in seconds. &&You just reminded me why I hated this movie.

What difference does that make?&&They used all real Astons in the production. &&That's usually true, but this was the real thing. The car wasn't particularly rare as far as Astons go and they easily had the budget to afford it, plus whatever they got in product placement payments. &&How can I buy a 68 charger from the factory&&[deleted]&&I feel like every time theres a new bond , the first one is the best. Goldeneye was dope.&&[deleted]&&Pierce got screwed over after GoldenEye. That first film was absolutely great and he really was a good Bond for that style. Actually almost Typecast between that and The Thomas Crown Affair. 

Every other film was significantly less quality but that's the thing with bonds they run the gamut in quality and I suppose there's so many of the pre 1990s films that almost no one watches any but the best.

Daniel Craig Bond definitely suffered from a tick tock effect of having every other be mediocre at best. Casino Royale was amazing, Quantum of Solace boring as hell, Skyfall absolutely as good as Casino Royale, Spectre they just wasted character development and talent they had casted

I'm not really sure what went wrong with those other two films because they can obviously get together amazing production&&They're just salty old farts. Many considered Brosnan to be an actor truly meant to portray Bond even when  he was just starting out.&&WHATS THE MATTER JAMES

The actual crash was an actual crash.&&My friend and I recently watched Casino Royale and he was speechlessly furious when Bond left her to go to Miami&&Not gonna lie, I kinda hoped that this was a thing&&And /u/crawlerz2468 - QoS ruins the Mathis storyline. Mathis HAS to have been a double agent or the plot of Casino Royale simply doesn't work. If Vesper is working against Bond the entire time, she has no incentive for all of her actions, namely refusing to stake Bond in the tournament again. The film doesn't work unless Mathis is also a bad guy.

Blame QoS. Also, bringing Mathis back only to get rid of him instantly is one of the worst things in movie history. Ruin the previous movie, then discard the character needlessly. (I would have used Mathis as the villain of the third movie, which you can do since before he is gone he claims to have pills for everything, including faking his own death, but anyway). QoS also uses the *lovely* Gemma Arterton for literally one scene and then she is killed off. 

The movie is a train wreck. And somehow, Skyfall is an even bigger train wreck.&&Do they install new balls there? &&It just dawned on me, is that scene an explanation of how Bond could bang so many women and not end up with children all of the globe?&&Pretty sure the chair had no seat&&At least 5¢&&Does it look like I give a damn?&&Also, it's product placement. Aston Martin probably pays to have their cars driven by Bond.&&Funny to think how racing driver Nicki Thiim is another public face of Aston, and how he's the absolute polar opposite of what the Bond figure represents.&&In Casino Royale, it could have been an actual DBS that was lacking everything except what was needed for it to drive. A roll cage for the stunt driver would be a must here.

To save even more money on this car. Aston could of even used rejected body panels, headlights, and outer trim pieces on it since it was going to be wrecked anyways.


Another option entirely would be that Aston gave them a test bed car that was slated to be destroyed. If it had to be destroyed anyways, might as well send it out in style.&&A lot of the time you can tell by looking at the wheels&&Astons are just a little more expensive than M3s, I think.

There were a couple of stock sounds i caught in there, and you'd be surprised at how much audio is replaced in tv & films - far cheaper to just get everything right in a studio environment, rather than to try and fuck around with the recorded audio to get it sounding right. Even with simple dialogues in quiet, closed environments, chances are that the audio has been replaced with ADR to get just the right sound.&&Good question but they probably didn't use the original.

&&According to the article, that was the original plan (Ramp hidden in foliage and dirt off to the side) but because they ended up having to use the gas cannon instead the scene had to be modified.&&Daniel Craig Bond had two good movies Skyfall is definitely just as good as Casino Royale and exceeds it in some places. The cinematography in detail with the lighting is absolutely top notch. Obviously very different feel. &&He's the pompous ass that saved us from aliens while Olivia Wilde remained really hot.  And naked.&&To me it seems like Brosnan actually embodies the image of Bond I have better than any of the other characters.  He just has a good blend of lethality, wry wittiness, and suave.  For me the others can't quite find the balance.  Connery comes off to as too laid back or too earnest.  Moore is much too silly.  Dalton / Craig are both too violent / intense.  I just wish they had been able to build more than one good movie around Brosnan's interpretation of the character.&&Daniel Craig Bond movies ranked
1 Skyfall
2 Casino Royal
3 Spectre
4 Quantum of Solace

I give Skyfall the slight edge over Casino Royal only because Javier Bardem was so good in that movie. 
If the pattern of good movie, bad movie continues then we should be in for a real good one next&&Skyfall was a TERRIBLE movie.  It just looked good.&&006: She tastes like.. like Strawberries..

Xenia: MMMMMMHHHNNNGGGGHHH&&That whole movie will forever be imprinted in my brain I watched it so many times as a child.&&No, steps 1-6 aren't necessary, at all. The writers could have quite easily, and more believably had the first step of Silva's plan be ""Wait for Bond to show up at my island as he inevitably will"", it would have been less ridiculous. But they didn't. Silva explicitly states that it was his plan from the start, he's smug about Severine's betrayal and mocks Bond for falling for it. Meaning the writers are expecting us to believe that Silva somehow deliberately set up all that shit in the Bazaar, the train, the casino and the boat. He takes credit for it, that's what makes it so dumb.

And yeah, Silva could have told his henchmen not to take his tracking device, but then if the henchmen were in on it, why were they all surprised by MI6 showing up? Are we expected to believe that Silva's henchmen were loyal to the point where they agreed to be slaughtered for his plan? Or are they all so stupid they can't figure out what will happen if they kidnap a government agent and leave him his tracker.

I agree that if steps 1-7 were the only problems the movie had and the ending made any kind of sense then it would have been forgivable...stupid, but forgivable. But with that ending, it magnifies the idiocy of everything that came before. Like if the only issue was Severine overly conveniently taking him to the island to kill Silva, then you could dismiss that. If everything else was water tight and Silva was just crossing his fingers and hoping that one thing would turn out in his favour, you could suspend your disbelief. But as one of a string of major plot contrivances...it's just absurd.&&Pretty sure he's quoting someone / joking. &&...I wanna argue with that logic, but don't know how... &&Okay, seriously.

We were best friends at nursery (kindergarten) then went to different schools. He went to the private school and I went to the state school. All through our school years we were sporting rivals culminating in a highly contested 100 metre sprint at the district sports day ( I won, but he said I got a headstart, I went on the 'B' of   'Bang' so well leave it at that hehe) then later on while we all were going out every night and getting drunk he went off and learned his trade as a daredevil. Many years pass by and im now plying my trade as an actor. He got the headstart this time but hopefully one day we'll be working on the same movie! &&like tears in rain.

Just simple things, like checking his hotel rooms for bugs or leaving a hair across the door so he could tell if someone was there. Don't get me wrong, I have affection for over the top action Bond also, but I prefer the more down to earth versions. So Casino Royale edges out Skyfall for me. &&I enjoyed it.

So that's 6 ""DBS's"" for the movie. 2 hero cars, 3 stunt cars and 1 practice car.

 *Hot Fuzz* has more gun clicky noises than there are even guns in any one shot although that's probably intentional because it's funny. Punches in movies always sound super fake though. Doesn't matter the movie, the punching noise is ridiculous. 

And on the topic of sound design in movies, the shootout in *Heat* is real. They really did use noise from set because no canned gunshot effects had that same deep roar as the real thing. &&Even Wall-E?&&And it felt soo goooodd&&And I'll never go baaack,

You blew a fart?&&That gritty black and white fight scene in the beginning...so ballsy to open with that. &&I love both, but I agree. CR is the best. Eva Green's eyes alone are worth watching because they're absolutely amazing--in Kingdom of Heaven as well. (the color is actually called *glasz*--a mix of blue, green and grey. Very common in Celts, especially in the Brittany region of France) 

I'm still trying to figure out reproduce her eye makeup. I'd also *love* to own than Algerian Loveknot necklace! From Sophie Harley in London https://sophieharley.com/collections/algerian-loveknot. 

I'd watch CR just for Craig and Greene in their beautiful clothes enjoying a lovely evening and acting like actual adults. Their bantering and conversation made their relationship more dimensional and authentic to me. As did the fact that Bond actually got seriously injured and had to recuperate at a hospital for several weeks then take more time to convalesce on vacation. Almost makes up for acting like he was fairly ok after the poison, defibrillator, and shot of Epinephrine.

Add Mads Mikkelsen's acting, his bleeding eye's performance, the opening parkour sequence (which really injured Craig when he slammed into that load of wood and beams carried by the crane--just watching that hurt)... I thought Mathis' performance was very similar to his character in 'Hannibal'. 

The torture scene was brutal. My dh and I watched this in a crowded theatre and you could feel everyone's extreme discomfort and empathy. I thought the scene gave Bond a humanity you don't usually see when he's emerging from gun massacres unscathed and driving a literal tank through buildings without even damaging his bespoke suit.
  

I watch these movies and fall in love with the cars. I wish there were companies that taught performance driving courses. Once you graduate different levels of instruction and log more driving hours you can rent and drive various cars on various lap courses. My dad did the Buddy Baker course --a multiple day NASCAR experience with classroom instruction then driving time with an instructor then solo. But I'm thinking more similar to skydiving and Scuba--your certifications/licenses are valid anywhere.&&
That always struck me as an odd note in the movie, replacing baccarat with Texas hold ‘em. On its face it doesn’t make a lick of sense. But I guess the game was better understood by people, given the poker craze at the time, and allowed for more suspense because the game is central to the movie’s plot. &&I can’t believe this supposed poker prodigy in Le Chiffre can’t get away from a full house on the wettest board ever, facing two all ins and obvious strong play from Bond.&&Are you talking about how the game isn't about reading people's subtle gestures but about reading their betting patterns? &&I thought it was fun and shot beautifully, but the entire second half of the film is just stupid and kind of ruins the whole thing.

In terms of ""Bondness"", Spectre is the movie for that.&&Yeah I suppose but I don’t ever notice. I’m not a huge spy movie guy, I always get lost somewhere in the plot and then have no idea what’s going on. As long as it’s good guy vs bad guy with cool cars, guns, and quips I’ll probably like it. That also probably explains why I liked Spectre and can’t figure out why everyone hates it so much&&But it looked purty...&&That’s good!&&1: wat

edit: wow I got gold for this? thanks stranger&&**Synopsis**: From the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes Ant-Man and The Wasp, a new chapter featuring heroes with the astonishing ability to shrink. In the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, Scott Lang grapples with the consequences of his choices as both a super hero and a father. As he struggles to rebalance his life with his responsibilities as Ant-Man, he's confronted by Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym with an urgent new mission. Scott must once again put on the suit and learn to fight alongside the Wasp as the team works together to uncover secrets from the past.&&Wish there was a bit more yellow on the Wasp suit. But I can still get behind their current design.&&Can't unsee the dick on her chest.&&Now Ant-Man I can get into.&&Can't wait to see the trailer on Conan.&&I love that the come-down from the terror of Infinity War is an Ant-man/Wasp Rom-Com.

Marvel knows what’s good.&&Anyone else find it odd that the star of the film hasn't been in any of the promotional material?

Show us Michael Pena already marvel, come on!&&How many ants are needed to fill an apartment? Ten-ants&&It's mad to think that an AntMan movie could potentially outgross a Justice League movie.&&Can't wait to see Evangeline Lilly in action&&Reminds me of the Beetle Borgs.&&She has boobs.&&WHAT IS THIS, A SUIT FOR ANTS??&&Looking forward to some Walton Goggins bad guy stuff in this one.&&As long as we get some Giant-man action&&God, I loved the first one.

If someone told me 10 years ago that one of my favourite Marvel movies was Ant-Man, I would have told them to fuck off and be serious.&&I was hoping for the classic yellow & black suit, this one is kind of disappointing.&&Least it's not like the picture of Venom that Sony posted. &&She looks like she is wearing Mass Effect armor.

Fuck. Now I want a Mass Effect movie. &&My time is coming again.&&I hope they wear their masks for more than 10 total minutes in the movie.  I hate this trend where you can't cover an actors face for more than 2 scenes.  Remember DARTH VADER?

I haven't heard any rumors - just a guess since it's also releasing this summer and we haven't seen any footage yet. It would be also interesting to see how much these two will figure in Infinity War (a lot? a little? not at all?)

God, I hate Pym.&&Some guy: ""Hey, lady! Did you know...?"" Wasp: ""Will everybody shut up about that?!""&&THANK FUCK. Wasp's suit looks actually like a comic book superhero costume. It's already miles better than the dumbass bland military suit that came online before. &&Everyone's complaining about how Wasp's costume isn't yellow enough, but I'll reserve judgment until I see the movie. It might not be her final outfit.&&Those helmets have no business working as well as they do. &&What? Antman?

""Basically the hero but bulkier and evil"" &&No.&&[deleted]&&War criminal? you mean just regular criminal right? also, you mean ""criminal"" right?&&I thought that was the original Ant-Man though.&&That was the Hank Pym version, which is why they went with the Scott Land version and made Hank a supporting character.

In fairness to Hank Pym though, he was never really a ""domestic abuser.""  He *once* backhanded his wife and knocked her down while in the middle of having a _**psychotic episode**_.

Abusers use abuse to control people, what Hank did was have a violent outburst that happened to harm his wife, and that outburst was a manifestation of deep mental health issues.

Say what you will about it, but it was controversial. Not a good start for a cinematic universe.&&I mean, Wonder Woman did all right. 

They just need to make good movies.

On the flipside, before the MCU I saw every Batman and Superman film in theatres. 

After the MCU? I've seen Man of Steel as a home rental, and I caught the Nolan Batman films on the big screen, but that is it. 

I did plan to see Wonder Woman, but I couldn't find the time. &&Spiderman already had way more brand recognition though, regardless of Civil War&&I hope BP is huge.

BP will have *everyone* jacked up and drooling for more, and they'll get it with BP and Waconda being heavily featured in IW. 

Experts are now saying BP could open with $115-$120MM but I truly believe they are dramatically underestimating the cultural significance of Black Panther. Factor in the unsatisfied feeling of the holiday season blockbusters of Justice League and Last Jedi, movie goers are hungry, if not desperate for an amazing theater experience. That's why I think Black Panther opens at $200MM+ and Infinity War rides that wave to $250MM+ opening weekend. &&Every black person oncthe planet is going to go see black panther.

[Spoilers obviously.](https://youtu.be/_mMuLwNR0J8)

Hank specifically describes going subatomic as ""entering a world where all concepts of ***time*** *and space* are irrelevant.""

So the in-universe explanation is that she's trapped in something ""outside of time,"" like the speed-force, mysterious islands, alternate dimensions, etc. Not exactly scientific, but it's an acceptable trope at this point. &&The age difference between Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer is 14 years.  I'm guessing not much time has passed for her.&&Michelle Pfeiffer&&Which is normal in MCU movies.

Iron Monger, Abonimation, Loki, Red Skull.

This is to show that good always wins against evil.&&Pretty much every orgin movie falls into this trap. &&When introducing a character, it doesn’t bother me really. When they do it over and over in subsequent sequels, then I have a problem. Ironman 2’s villain was awful for that reason because he was iron monger 2.0. When introducing the character, I think it’s kinda necessary to show that the character truly is a hero because the movie clearly spells out that with the same power set, they can be a villain.&&Marvel does this often for a variety of reasons.

* The hero and villain can share parts of their origin stories, for more efficient storytelling. We didn't have to spend any time at all explaining Yellowjacket's powers, he's using most of the same tech Ant-Man uses.

* The villain can represent a path of choices that the hero *could've* taken, but didn't. Scott could make a pretty penny stealing the shrinking technology and selling it himself.

* Symmetric fights can showcase the hero's powers better. You wouldn't be able to have a fight in a suitcase with any other villain!&&    >bugged

Heh.&&I just want a gigantic kaiju battle between antman and the bad guy now that he can be giantman. &&You know, that'd actually be kind of a nice change of pace. &&In the comics, she shoots lasers from her hands. She also doesn't need the suit to shrink, due to exposure to Pym particles.

It's so over the top, trying so hard to be edgy, it felt like a parody.&&I’ve never seen an audience rush to the exit as soon as a movie finished faster then they did after my screening of Suicide Squad. I wish I recorded it.&&Exec 1: “How do we introduce SuperMan to a new generation of children?”



Exec 2: “Let’s make a movie that’s grim, slow paced, violent...”



Exec 1: “ I’m liking it”



Exec 2: “And with Superman breaking a guys neck”



Exec 1: “Brilliant. Also let’s not have Superman be in a kids cartoon for at least 4 years after the movie”



Exec 2: “I just don’t see how any of this could go wrong”&&The meddling management aspect wasn’t the core problem. WB are a “directors studio” they’re pretty relaxed in order to keep talent at the studio. They gave Snyder control with Superman and BVS and look how that turned out, they recut Suicide Squad reportedly with David Ayer’s approval (I can only imagine what the original film could’ve looked like if *that* mess was the film they gave us).



If anything the problem was down to being too relaxed whilst giving movies to the wrong people. The directors they’ve hired for The Flash movie indicates WB are gonna get a lot more involved with their films. 2 no-name directors that will be easy to control.&&Well that and they don’t bog it down with pointless tie-ins.  They surprisingly showed a lot of restraint and let Wonder Woman stand on her own merits. 

A lesser director would have had her meet up with Bruce Wayne’s grandad or some shit. &&There was a time when I wondered why they'd even make a Thor movie. Like who wants to see Thor?

Fast forward a few years and I'm telling my girlfriend we HAVE to see the new Thor movie.

Marvel has definitely established a level of entertainment that DC/WB haven't come close to matching. After the Nolan series (which was great) they totally lost focus. It's so disappointing.

But I'm totally going to watch Black Panther, now. I'm so committed to the universe I can't remember the last time I didn't watch an MCU release in the theater.&&Wonder Woman is about the only movie worth watching in the whole new mess. &&I take my daughter to see all the Marvel films. We make a day of it. I think that’s where they’ve succeeded, they made good films for the whole family. DC put out BVS and my daughter got bored, the result of that was that she didn’t wanna see Justice League with me.&&The last 2 movies however started a downward trend for the character. The last ‘Amazing’ film did $700m (and a very low $200m in the US. It was on its last legs domestically). They put Spidey in Civil War and now the new movie did almost $900m at the BO with $330m domestically &&It’s going to be. It’s already breaking ticket pre-sale records.

If you want to see it opening weekend. You need to get tickets ASAP.&&man, i loved mystic knights, iv'e always been a fan of medieval sword/sorcery type stuff and to have basically a power rangers but medieval was just what kid me wanted
 &&>Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog

I vividly remember watching the TV at the right times and asking my dad to buy the things I needed to win a trip to go to Ireland or whatever to see a filming of an episode of that show. I loved that show so much as a kid and it's barely even a footnote near the juggernaut that was Power Rangers.&&I remember being a kid and it must've been around the time *Mystic Knights* got cancelled because my Mom and I were in a toy store and they had a bunch of the toys on clearance (something stupid like £1 a figure) and I managed to convince my Mom to buy me a bunch. God I was in heaven for weeks afterwards.&&Someone pointed it out to me elsewhere, so I figured I'd share the torment. &&But you did on Superman, and many many other male superheros for almost a century. And now it's six pack dividers.&&No helmets is just a film/tv thing. It sacrifices realism in favor of making it easier to tell who is who and allowing actors to act with their faces. &&Ugh, don't remind me. 

Even after all these years, I'm almost impressed by how completely and totally those movies managed to turn probably [*the most* visually stunning and aesthetically diverse cast](https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/e/e2/XMenInline4.jpg) in all of superhero canon into a bunch of black-and-silver Ken dolls in rubber suits.

That explains why Evangeline Lilly is getting a bigger role in this film

Haha. 😂&&I mean they were obviously going for a darker tone for the universe which itself isn’t a bad idea. It would’ve been nice to have a different take than the marvel formula. They’re main problem is that they made bad movies. BvS and suicide were perfect for the dark tone but the writing was so bad and they tried to do so much that they ended up with a complete mess. In they end they learned the wrong lesson by trying to make JL lighter tone... but they still forgot to make a good movie.&&I was the same with Iron Man and Thor. My friend practically dragged me to those films.

I'm glad he did! &&True. You also have to take into account having Iron Man in the movie probably increased its box office&&pre-sale isn't a good indication of how well the movie will perform, only that the opening weekend will be strong.&&I know but it could be extremely front-loaded. That would suck. &&When I was a kid, I had a bunch of action figures from that show, but never knew they were from a tv show. I bought them with my allowance from the CVS near my house, and didn't even know their names.

Years later came across clips from the show on youtube. It was a weird experience to see a bunch of people dressed up as my action figures.

In the comic book Hank is much older than her. Like Reed and Susan.&&Maybe nothing. Perhaps in the subatomic level she experiences time differently. Some people are saying she wouldn't experience any time at all, but if that were true she'd literally be frozen and unable to move or think. Scott was still able to move and think at that level.

Perhaps 30 years to us would only be 3 days from her perspective. That's long enough to survive without starving.&&Fortunately, he's not gonna be the only villain.&&Well yeah, he was the Doctor's first ""success"" and he had basically the same super serum that the Captain had.

Same deal with the Lizard in *Amazing Spider-Man*.

...................I'm ok.&&Why don't ants get sick? Becsuse they have little anty-bodies.&&Blunderdun Cumberbun&&We're some kind of overused meme squad?&&Final act and climax made no sense. It involved a lot of shitty CGI, a belly dancing witch, and a giant apocalyptic sky beam. Also, the squad decided that they’re now a family after spending a whole evening together, completely out of nowhere.&&That moment when Rick Flag yells ""Her heart's out. We can end this!""&&The whole thing is the worst part. &&There was no worst part. The whole things was stitched together like a low-rent Frankenstein using leftover parts from bad dreams. The beginning took three hours to introduce half of the characters, often giving them two or three introductions, while ignoring the other half. When the plot finally kicked off, the Squad got sent off on a mission that was just a distraction, as if the writers felt like they had to have a twist, but, since even bad twists got crushed into cliche by M Night Shamalamalama, they didn't even bother coming up with a good one, let alone making it fit into the overall story. Then the team, whose members had zero chemistry, plot-conveniently decided they were a family so they could take out the bad guy. And the final scene was cheap fireworks and nonsense bad acting. 

There were so many story threads flopping out in every direction, and most of them didn't go anywhere. There were all sorts of unearned character moments. You were told that everyone was a badass, but you almost never got a chance to see them actually be *badass*. 

It should be the textbook example of a director saying ""we'll fix it in post"", but then not being able to fix it. It's simply a hot mess, something to be pored over for years by aspiring filmmakers looking for clues of what not to do. &&*THIS IS KATANA*&&Also the fact that it didn't suck and everyone was casted well.

Also when he told that story, he was solemn, regretful, sad, then Harley yells at him to ""own that shit"" to not beat around the bush and admit that he killed his family.

Depending on make-up and such, Pfeiffer could easily pass for 40-50. [This was her just a few months ago in September.](http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/22147bedb937b76c7047b06e1767f2af) Add some movie make-up and effects and you can easily take 10-20 years off of her.

Remember that Michael Douglas is 73. A big part of his character was that he was simply too old to put the suit on again so we can assume that his character is also in his 70's. Let's also assume that Hank and Janet were the same age originally. If Hank is now in his 70's and with movie make-up they make Pfeiffer look like she's in her 40's then that will prove that Janet experienced time much more slowly in the subatomic realm. 

The 30 year difference in their ages would prove that she wasn't there for very long at all, at least from her perspective. It really might have only felt like a few days to her. Maybe even just a few hours. &&Pfeiffer looks really good for her age, so she could play younger.  But I think the logic to the casting is to make sure that Janet isn't distractingly young paired with Douglas' Hank.&&I mean, the best ones do have multiple villains. Winter Soldier has Bucky and that senator guy. Civil War has Zemo and Tony (and Crossbones). I am all for T'Challa finding some form of truce with the Killmonger if it means taking down the Klaw - after all, Eric is not all bad and even ruled Wakanda for awhile.&&She took Scotts for that scene, so it’s not like she’s losing anything &&Balderdash Canonflash&&>  It’ll never die.

I think you’re being *extremely* generous here, but I agree with the sentiment overall.

If the movie had ended differently, and more appropriately, I wouldn’t have regretted buying my ticket. It would have been solidly in the “meh” category, but I wouldn’t have hated it. It definitely needed a low-stakes ending, and they blew it.&&It's flashing red! shoot that part!!&&That’s where she keeps her honey

I had so much hope the first time they broke into the mix, but wasn't too impressed besides Beer Fest...&&..... still waiting for that Potfest, boys..... let's get on it!  


Perfect time to do it, politically.&&When are we gonna get the Potfest we deserve.  The world is clearly ready for it!&&More than that I hope it continues to foster the microfinancing of movies. I had a blast paying for this; they ran a great fundraising campaign. I would love to get to see other niche shit get made in future. The fragmentation of media financing and distribution is really the one thing this timeline has going for it.&&I don't need it to be good, i just need it to not be shitty!&&But you've already seen it now.&&>pullover

no it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing&&I kept meaning to and then forgot until like 2 days after it ended :/&&Yeah as most comedy sequels go I was expecting a lot of cringey rehashed jokes but this looks hilarious. I'm ready for more Farva&&I hope its not one of those where all the funny or scary stuff is in the trailer&&Same here. I remember sitting on my (now ex)girlfriend's computer and signing up for the cheapest thing, which was a photocopied print of their asses. A shame they fell through on that one I think, but I updated my address from emails they've sent me and am not sure what they plan to send me, if anything.&&Ooiii I vant one&&> I've been wanting a mustache ride for a while ~~now~~ **meow**.

FTFY
&&I hope they have some healthy banter with the Mounties. There's so many opportunities there.&&I was excited to see Rob Lowe!&&Honestly, I laughed aloud at a few of the bits here. I'm cautiously optimistic &&That French gibberish between Steve and Jay at the end of the trailer was fucking hysterical. My wife and I were both nearly in tears!&&Even if it is just ok, I will be happy. &&Worked on this film, you are correct to be optimistic. &&They have a funny France accent but to nail the Quebecois accent they should study GSP and Denis Villeneuve.&&Like the German accents were “accurate” in beer fest, who cares! &&I feel the same way.  Hopefully what we saw here wasn't the best parts&&Steve lemme plays a different ethnicity very well&&“I pledge of allegiance to the flag...” made me lol&&I'm surprised by how good this looks. As a Québecer, I'm fucking stoked that they're going to poke fun at us!

Also, ""[ça plane pour moi](https://youtu.be/K6HrLN32hvw)"" by Plastic Bertrand is a wicked song.&&For real that chicks name just might as well be Sloan because that's what everyone calls her lol &&They say on the podcast they do that they didn't wanna put the funniest stuff in the trailer. But they also said they weren't worried because the movie is so packed with funny that it wouldn't hurt to put a bunch in the trailer.&&Ann Perkins..&&Kanye = God

TPB is the pride of Canada.&&That’s a mighty low bar you’ve set their, friend. I dunno, for me I think I’m over hearing exaggerated québécois and letterkenny accents whenever Canadians are on American tv or movies. 

I’m Canadian and am so used to hearing people just talk normally without either of those accents so it’s always kinda bugged me that those outliers are considered our identity. 

I know they’re used because it’s more interesting than just hearing someone talk normally, it’s just disappointing not seeing a more traditional depiction of a Canadian.

 I think Rob Lowe might be playing a traditional accentless Canadian or he might just suck at doing the exaggerated one everyone else is doing. &&I really would love to see another Strange Brew.&&*booping*&&What was the bopping about?&&Canadian here too, I just call it mix.&&[We have many names for pop here in the ol' Red, White & Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_soft_drinks_in_the_United_States)&&The only Canadian that ever called it something other than pop was [Kim Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXnTbmPxv5g)&&Pop sounds childish to me, but Soda and pop are interchangable in my book, as they refer to carbonated drinks.

COLA however is not something that can be applied to all sodas/pops. It refers to sodas/pops made with Kola nut. See Coca Cola/Pepsi Cola. This does not include Dr. Pepper, which is not made with the kola nut.

Liter'o'cola could be correct if you are only offering coke, pepsi, or storebrand cola and feel like being needlessly specific.&&Really?

It's been so long that I forgot I signed up on their indiegogo.&&I'm not ashamed to admit that I was 13 when that movie came out and I jerked off to that scene. &&Hopefully it lives up to the rivalry they had with the local cops in the original.&&The Broken Lizard movies are best when there's a villain.

He is a wonderful human being and an even better friend.  

I relish his appearance in this movie. &&I seriously thought I saw Bruce Willis in the angry meeting mob, sitting on the aisle.

Just like everyone having a southern accent in anything in the south or everyone from Chicago sounding like the SNL sketch of Da Bears but they don’t. It’s just the way people make things in tv and movies if it’s set in any area with something distinguishable about it then every main character has to have that feature, especially comedies for the cheap yucks from people not from the area.
Edit: I am also from Massachusetts and I know plenty of people who don’t have it and plenty that do it depends on where they’re from in the state.&&This movie is going to be fun as hell no matter what.

I live across the way from Canada and even though it's subtle, I can definitely tell the difference between a Canadian and American accent.

Octavia Spencer plans to buy out Mississippi screening of 'Black Panther' for underserved communities,44915,7ue4jw,http://ew.com/movies/2018/01/31/octavia-spencer-black-panther-screening-mississippi/,3068,1517439729.0,,"Under served!  I kept reading ""undeserved"" and wondering why a bunch of poor people in Mississippi didn't deserve to see the movie (or why she would buy them tickets if they didn't deserve it).&&Evacuate the cinema.
Buy out all the tickets.
And get this man a seat.

&&If she wants to rent out a theater for an ""underserved community"", she'll have plenty of theater operators happy to accommodate her. Her bigger problem will be finding a truly underserved community that has one. Jackson, for example: largest city, capital city, population ~170k, ~80% black. Zero active movie screens within city limits. *ZERO*. Of the majority-black communities in the state, maybe half a dozen have even one screen. &&That feeling when your dyslexia kicks in and you're thinking why would anybody buy out a screening for ""undeserved"" communities&&Meanwhile at Disney,""$$$$$$$$$"". &&For the premier of Antman, I will be buying out one theater for people under 5 feet tall and another for people over 6.5 feet tall. &&[When my phone goes off during the screening] (https://imgur.com/a/RjfeO)&&*Sorts by controversial*

Oh dear god &&Hyphens, people! Use them, and under-served wont look like undeserved. &&Copy/pasting this from a reply of mine in this thread, but I thought it should be its own comment.

People are complaining about how wild everybody is going over this movie, so I wanted to bring in a different perspective. This isn’t the first black superhero movie, but it is the first black superhero movie where the majority of the supporting cast is black, the director is black, the writer is black, and the person overseeing the soundtrack is black (Kendrick).

The problem goes way back. Even when it started to be ‘acceptable’ for black people to be in films (think “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” with Sidney Poitier), they were still written and directed by white people. The response to this was a lot of movies made and performed by black people, which made black communities very happy. This is the same thing. That’s why Moonlight was such a huge deal to a lot of people. It’s about the authenticity; lots of people complained that the characters Poitier portrayed did not reflect the realities of black people in America at the time, like they sanitized reality.&&And now I patiently wait for Redditors to turn this into some sort of bad thing. &&Is underserved just a fancy word for poor people? &&Underserved ""black"" communities. Fixed it.&&Can't we just enjoy the movie? Kinda feeling like black people (I am black fyi) are going crazy because this movie just happens to feature a black superhero not because it's going to be good or because they are superhero movie fans. For example mystery mother a 50+ year old woman isn't really that into the marvel films and may have seen three or four of them. But she's going to see black panther just because he's black. Yet he's not the first black superhero to get a movie! Don't get me wrong I'm glad the movie got made and people are taking an interest but I feel like they are taking an interest for the wrong reasons. I myself am stoked but I that's because I love the marvel movies and the fact that there's an African setting is simply a bonus.&&There's a theatre where I live doing an andvanced screening for people of color only. incase you are wondering how, an organization has rented out the theatre and is only selling tickets to POC
edit: For everyone freaking out the entire theatre will still be open to the general public there will be other screenings at the same time. One theatre has been rented out by a private organization for a private event&&[removed]&&Underserved as in black? Why can't we just call it as it is? &&Yeah, but only brown people. Cause there are no underserved Hispanic, Whites, Asians, Indians, etc....&&TIL further division is the key to unity&&That's a nice thing to do actually. To mention areas lacking  theaters, this is something a poverty issue more than a race one

Median incomes in many parts of Mississippi don't support enough theater visits to make that kind of business pay and with competition from less costly sources , the big screen is an expensive luxury 

The problem plagues the US re: bookstores as well although a disinterest in reading and Amazon have effects there as well.&&Why not invest the money into the community instead, versus handing it over to a big movie studio? &&Not sure why most of these threads focus on Jackson so much.  She could easily buy out the theater in Greenville and accomplish the same goal if it has to be majority black area.  I don't think it said that though so I'm 100% positive she can find a great theater anywhere in the state to serve the underserved kids.&&Wasn't there an article which she told white people to stay away from Black Panther. &&What trash to think undeserving communities consist of only African American people. Open your eyes and look around, people of all color are suffering and to pick a certain demographic to be charitable shows the racist pettiness through and through. &&Conspiracy theory: movies with black people and/or women in lead roles usually sell less, so studios manufacture these controversies to get more views.&&I wonder how much these community-style viewings are affecting the pre-sale numbers.

Those numbers are really high and this is like the fiftieth time I've seen some group announce that they are gonna be sponsoring an event or whatever

EDIT: lol wtf is this being downvoted for?&&Are there only brown under served community members?&&Every underserved child deserves to watch a movie about an ethno-nationalist superhero.&&Hispanics and Whites too right? &&Why the fuck is a marvel movie a civil rights movement  now&&That hilarious moment when black people segregate themselves. &&Why is this film all of a sudden a rallying cry for black people? Like where is all the love for comic? It's kinda cringy &&I want this movie to succeed for no more reason than the fact that if it doesn't tons of articles will be written about how white people are to blame for it failing &&I'm sure this movie will be the exact same competent fare that every other marvel movie is.  But since it has a black cast it's a masterpiece.&&I don't see how the pendulum swinging back the other way is helpful in creating a healthy society.

I'm not okay with racism; Or in other words, I'm not okay with people being treated differently because of the color of their skin. 

At the end of the day, it's her money and she can do what she wants with it. But if a white actor announced they were buying out a movie theater so that ONLY poor white kids could watch, there would be a huge uproar. So excuse me if I won't sit back and applaud this racist move. Upset that I called it racist? Think about it again...

If Ms. Spencer wants to make it so that POOR children, of ANY color, can go see a superhero movie and get inspired, that's awesome! Because most kids can give a shit about race; my 4 year old is excited about Black Panther, and he makes milk look tan.

Racism is something that is taught, not something that is innate.  In excluding white, Indian, Latino, Asian, etc. children from her otherwise-generous offer, Ms. Spencer is unfortunately (and probably unwittingly) perpetuating racism. :(&&so i guess any poor latinos or white kids living there get nothing.&&Is this about to become a race thing?

Maybe he’ll do the same. Our theaters suck anyway. There’s probably a bunch of kids that would love that. they may not get to see otherwise. &&I think it's nice, but more as a way to let poor kids see a movie for free.  I don't think seeing the movie is really going to help their self esteem or inspire them.  We did have a black president for 8 years who got insanely good treatment in the media.  The kids didn't notice that?  It's silly the way this movie is being hyped racially.&&[deleted]&&""I will be in MS when this movie opens. I think I will buy out a theatre in an underserved community there to ensure that all our brown children can see themselves as a superhero."" 

Lets face it, that shits racist. I'm sure there are poor white kids that would love to see it. If A white man bought out an entire theater just for white people there would be riots. How about we actually strive for equality and she just buys it out for underserved of all colors. 

I can't wait to see some true equality in this world, but I fear that's like chasing perfection. &&Through her roles, Octavia Spencer seems like a decent, down to Earth person, like Tom Hanks. In real life I hope she is that nice, not some psycho who strangles hookers with typewriter ribbons.

It’s called capitalism. You have money and you get served a movie ticket. Nobody is being denied anything &&My father, a member of Doctors Without Borders, would often come home from a month in a real poor part of the world and he’d cry in the night, sometimes for hours. When asked why, he’d always say he saw so much despair and it could be alleviated so easily. I asked how we could do that and he’d say, every time I asked,  ‘If we could only get these people to a movie everything would be all right’. Wise man, just like this saintly woman. &&The less we focus on race, the better off we'll be. BUT that means respecting each other. As a mulatto with black and white family I find American race relations so archaic. ( Affirmative action still?).  Embracing the flag/ motherland is what can unite us and critiquing her is always fair game, as the founding fathers intended. America is more about class division and people fail to see that due to arrogance and pride. An educated citizenry is essential to a healthy republic, so said Jefferson.&&This comment section is a wonderful smattering of the worst of the right and left.  I'm just gonna go enjoy what looks to be a great movie!  See ya nerds!

Also, Antman and the Wasp looks great!!!!&&> why she would buy them tickets if they didn't deserve it)

I was reading it like she bought every ticket so the undeserving folk couldn't get one&&I read this the same way&&Ha, I read it as ""undeserved"" and for some reason thought that meant she had bought out the theater so she could make sure *no one* got to see it in the community.

EDIT: i actually ended up googling ""semantic vs pedantic"" after this and a derived term of ""semantic"" is ""antisemantic"". that is all.&&What about popcorn?&&What about the milk duds? &&Happy birthday :D&&That's pretty fucking wild to me&&Hold up, the largest city in Mississippi has 170k people?&&The key word being ""within city limits"" - the theater in Pearl is not that far. Maybe a 10 minute drive. Although transportation is a huge issue in our poorest communities. A 10 minute drive will put it well out of reach out of many citizens of the Jackson community, but certainly not all. 

I would also suspect that there are many metropolitian areas -regardless of average income -  that don't have a proper movie theater. Rent is crazy expensive in most downtown areas and movie theaters take up a lot of space + have razor thin operating margins. It makes sense to develop them in neighboring suburban spots. Urban areas tend to have art-house/smaller theaters. Jackson has one of these - the Alamo Theater. Although it looks like the theater is catering more to live productions now. 

There is something that bugs me about your post. Why are you putting ""underserved community"" in air quotes? 

&&Jackson County, the second biggest county in the state, doesn’t even have a movie theater. &&>Jackson, for example: largest city, capital city, population ~170k, ~80% black. Zero active movie screens within city limits. ZERO. Of the majority-black communities in the state, maybe half a dozen have even one screen.

There is obviously something else going on here. I simply can't believe a hundred and seventy thousand people can't support a single theatre. Do they just not want one?

I mean going to the movies tends towards the expensive, but I am willing to bet these areas support plenty of other business in the same cost vein.&&And Hattiesburg has fucking two of 'em in 10 minutes of each other.&&If it were profitable, there would be a theater there.

Literally nothing is stopping a black businessman from starting a theater in Jackson. If anything, there's free incentives for black-owned theater ownership.&&white flight = paying customers leaving = no more theater&&Why do you think there are 0 movie theaters in the city?&&I live in the middle of Jackson.  There are at least 3 theaters within a 10 minutes drive. One of which is a quite large Cinemark. &&If you are wondering why there aren't more movie theaters in black demographic areas, it's due to the fact during the 50's, 60's and 70's people would constantly tear the screens by throwing objects, shooting bb guns and spilling things on them. This would cost the small theater owner thousands of dollars and one less room for seating and projection. Theater owners have to this day avoided black communities because of their experience earlier in America.&&She should have a theater built.&&Yes but there are 4 within a 10 minute drive.&&Lol I live in Jackson and it there are about 4 movie theaters within 5 minutes of my house in the surrounding cities...there used to a couple in the city but the crime rate was just outrageous and people stopped going so nicer theaters decided to pop in the the much safer and honestly much nicer cities that make up the Jackson metro area

Edit: I believe a couple of the theaters have 18 screens and the other 2 have about 15 or 16 I can't remember&&How is that possible? The town where I live is 120k people and we have two theaters with a third being built right now.

Did theaters there exist and just go out of business or something?&&That's not the case at all. I know of at least 2 movie theaters in the Jackson area, though they're technically in Pearl and Flowood (both of which may as well be part of Jackson). Though I guess it is accurate to  say there are none actually IN Jackson, there are some litterally minutes from the city limits. Mississippi does have backwards people/areas, but my gosh, we don't live in huts. We have all the modern conviniences you'd find in any other state, just less of them. And pretty much all of which are accessable to people from black communities.&&That's a bit disingenuous.  There aren't any within the city limits because they're all just outside the city limits (probably for tax or fire code reasons).  One of them sits 4.3 miles from downtown, another a few blocks just outside the official city limits.  

It's more Jackson's weird boundaries than the lack of theatres.&&as a resident jacksonian, i have to argue that most of us consider the surrounding cities part of jackson. if she wanted to serve the capital, she could choose from a couple different ones well within 10-15 minutes.

For some, it's more than just having a black superhero. this might be the first time a lot of kids of color will see a major hollywood movie where everybody onscreen is a person of color as well. 

And it's a movie that promotes black excellence by tapping into afro-futurist (or afropunk) culture, which is based around a science-fiction future that people of color forge and invent for themselves. Rather than a world of white people that people of color have the given-privilege of living in (such as America, where black people literally had to be ""given"" rights), afro-futurist cultures imagine utopias created by and for people of color. 

for many, it serves as motivation for people not to take their circumstances and community for granted, and instead shape the world around them into a future they believe in. 

afro-futurism has been around a long time, but this might be the biggest afro-futurist project ever, and for some people it'll be the first time they will see something afro-futurist in their lives. 

quick edit: i'm giving a real simplification of afro-futurism here, it's really a lot more complicated than this, but you have the gist at least for why some might think that it's important that children of color get a chance to experience a movie steeped in this subgenre of science fiction. [(read more here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism)&&> Yet he's not the first black superhero to get a movie!

Yeah, I am shocked that black kids and teens today are excited about  a superhero movie starring a black lead. They had a movie A WHOLE twenty years ago with a black lead. It even had a second sequel only 14 years ago. Sure, that one was a shitty movie. And all three movies were not really suitable for children and families. But that one hero two decades ago should be enough for them.&&Black super hero surrounded by tons of other black actors, black director, black music producer — and its representing (indirectly) the history of African culture and they’re spending a billion on it.

Show me that happening before.&&That’s not why black people are going all out for it. This isn’t the first black superhero movie. But it is the first black superhero movie where the majority of the supporting cast is black, the director is black, the writer is black, and the person overseeing the soundtrack is black (Kendrick).

The problem goes way back. Even when it started to be ‘acceptable’ for black people to be in films (think “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” with Sidney Poitier), they were still written and directed by white people. The response to this was a lot of movies made and performed by black people, which made black communities very happy. This is the same thing. That’s why Moonlight was such a huge deal to a lot of people. It’s about the authenticity; lots of people complained that the characters Poitier portrayed did not reflect the realities of black people in America at the time, like they sanitized reality.

“Strike a blow for social justice by consuming this mass media product made in a laboratory by MBAs and focus groups paid for by a soulless megacorporation!”

You can still get to a movie theater in 10-20 minutes it's not a big deal.&&There are certain businesses that can't make money in black majority areas. &&Given the price of tickets and concessions, movie theaters are definitely a luxury these days.  Kinda surprised there aren't any second-run theaters, but maybe even those aren't profitable.

It's interesting because black viewers are actually slightly over-represented among movie audiences (as in they are approximately 13% of population but 15% of estimated movie audiences).  So a black person is individually more likely to go to the movies than white person. So clearly there are other forces at work.&&Right? I live in a town of 5,000. We have a theater... Albeit personally owned and operated.&&Metro population about 300-350k, depending on how big of a radius you draw, but yes. The state only has around 3M people. It's pretty empty.&&Arkansas isn't that far off. 200k? With a population of 3m in the state. Most southern states aren't that densely populated&&Most Jackson residents, even the poorest, own a car.&&“black”&&Is The Grand not in Jackson County?&&TIL Living in Mississippi is fucking hell.&&A brief 15-20 min from much of Jackson county there is a movie theatre. Doesn’t compare.&&It's probably 'the movie theaters are technically just over the line in the next town'

I know plenty of towns that have 0 movie theaters, but they are usually very close to one that does. Lots of 'expensive' towns don't have one either, b/c of zoning restrictions and/or the price of real estate&&The answer is simple. If it made sense financially, there would be a theater in the city limits. Multiple people have already answered that there are plenty of theaters within a 10 minute drive, so the obvious answer seems to be that a theater in the city itself just doesn't make economic sense. If I had to guess, it would be that the rate of return on that large of a real estate commitment just doesn't make sense in that particular market, and pencils out better by putting it right outside the city limits.&&I live in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. *Most* of our theaters are technically in the suburbs instead of the cities proper. (I don't even know... is that one that was in the trade center in downtown St. Paul still open?)  There are a few exceptions but they are few and far between. the Burbs were s just the only places enough land was available when they started going up in larger numbers. Thing is most theaters in the suburbs are still easily reachable for people that live in the city by car/bus and even the light rail will take you to the Mall of America where there is a movie theater. 

Growing up as a kid I lived in St. Paul. We would take a bus to the Maplewood theaters near the mall to see movies. &&See above comment of mine and others. There are plenty just not in Jackson propper.&&Movie theaters simply don't make enough money to justify the costs in higher population density areas in my understanding. People tend to think of cities as the actual city *and* the metropolitan area, so they think all cities have theaters, but it's more rare than you'd think if you aren't willing to drive out to the suburbs and stripmalls where population density is lower.&&Vandalism.
Running a movie theater is too expensive to have it being torn up.&&You could probably make it from Parkway Flowood to Tinseltown Pearl within ten minutes.&&It’s almost as if supply and demand is actually a real thing.&&Same in Oxford too.&&Kind of my point. They're not ""underserved"", they're just incapable of supporting the services she wants. It's like complaining about how there aren't any Costcos in rural Wyoming.&&Sounds like they're just over the edge of town. It's the same deal here in Central Illinois. All the theaters are at the edge of town (or were, but town has expanded out to meet them). &&Sounds like an immersive experience &&Source?&&Source? That is interesting.&&Yes. After 1980, at least five theaters encompassing fourteen screens have closed. Still in the suburbs. It's very much a Detroit-style problem: the money is there, but nobody wants to be subject to a government that is at best whimsical.&&Well, Jackson is an inner city surrounded by suburbs. The *suburbs* have theatres, just not the city itself.

If you live in a town of 120k that isn't surrounded by other populated areas, then it would make sense you have two/three theatres because it's not like you can just drive 15 minutes to the suburbs and be at one.

Here in my city most of the theatres are out in the suburbs as well, it's rarer to find them in the inner city unless you're in a HUGE city like NYC where people generally don't have cars. Parking is a huge must for most theatres. Here we have two downtown, and one of them is a one-screen arthouse while the other is fairly new and is part of a large redevelopment project with a football stadium + has a huge underground parking garage and stuff.&&Key phrase: ""within city limits"". Hint: there's a reason that there are a bunch of cinemas that are just barely outside the limits.&&Helps that it's not that commonly used of a word. &&Shouldnt it be ""under served"" instead of a single word?&&Same here. Has nothing to do with dyslexia, way more with you know ... other reasons.&&Reddit's ""Controversial"" sort is just a Reddit view for people who like reading YouTube comments.&&>Do you think all of these people were chosen to work on this film partly because they were black?

Not everyone who worked on the film is black (see Rachel Morrison, Ludwig Göransson), but ignoring that, the film's set in Wakanda, an isolated African nation that has separated itself from the world to avoid colonialism and invasion. Most of the cast were chosen because they're black and there's nothing wrong with that because being black is an important and relevant part of the characters. As for Ryan Coogler, he's a great director and whether he was chosen because he's black is debatable, but either way, him approaching the material in a very personal way seems to be a part of why he was. The other writer for the film, Joe Robert Cole, was part of an in house writing initiative Marvel set up where upcoming writers got to choose projects they were interested in developing. He had a crack at Inhumans and then moved on to Black Panther.&&WHOA WHOA WHOA &&#Make Wakanda Great Again&&^ This but unironically.&&Wakanda is the most hardcore ethnostate on earth; a racist’s wet dream &&Darn ethnostates.&&And the X-Men are different and are singled out rounded up and put into camps for execution.

Wakanda is a black ethnostate but it's imperative that there's no whitewashing.

It's really fucking obvious what you're doing, Hollywood.&&It’s just something fun for the community to do for one night.

Also, how do know that she's not donating other money to those said communities?

And she did [something similar](https://ca.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/02017011332262/octavia-spencer-hidden-figures-screening-la-charity%20%20/) when Hidden Figures came out.&&you need to visit some better subs!  the smaller ones are much better, or ones that carry a heavy banhammer like /r/askhistory are amazing.&&I'm so tired of Reddit, it disgusts me. I should tell people on Reddit about this as I peruse day's content.&&Honestly if Reddit didn’t constantly delete controversial boards we’d be there. &&> > Yet he's not the first black superhero to get a movie!

>  ...blade is always getting shunned...

He's *also* not the first black superhero to get a movie. Blade came out in '98.  Steel (1997) is the first superhero movie with a black main character I can think of off-hand.  Were there any prior to that?
&&Spawn was pretty cool too.&&Hancock was fantastic &&Even earlier was Spawn&&And you know what? *Nobody fucking cared that Blade was black.* He was just Blade.&&And Blade 2 was fantastic.&&[deleted]&&> something other than a goofball or dealer or killer

Have you watched TV or movies lately? &&I wish people had the ability to identify with any character of any race. I'm black and identify with Luke Skywalker more than Black Panther.&&(For the record I am half white and half Filipino)

I expect this movie to be good, since Marvel has consistently made good movies (in my opinion anyway), but I can't help but think the most politically minded people will be unsatisfied. I don't think it'll make the grand political statement that they want, and they may be turned off further by how it'll inevitably set up *Infinity War* (calling it now: there will be think pieces about the parts tying it into the rest of the franchise and calling those aspects white-supremacist). 

It'll be a good superhero movie with a black cast (which is positive for African-Americans in its own way). There's nothing wrong with that at all, but I think the people who wanted something more political will be disappointed.&&If you think this is their chance to see a black person in a role that isnt a ""goofball, dealer, or killer"", you clearly haven't seen many movies or watched any TV lately. There's no reason to paint this as something it isn't to get more attention.&&This was exactly how I felt when people dissed the excitement over Wonder Woman by pointing out that Ripley and Sarah Connor were strong women leads.&&Young black people are really into their culture. This generation of teenagers are all about loving their culture and being themselves. Black panther is coming out at a really good time, black twitter is going bananas. &&> history of African culture

What?&&>  and its representing (indirectly) the history of African culture

What? Obviously, Wakanda is a fake country, but it's also one that doesn't really resemble any real ones that closely. It's isolationist, walled off, ridiculously high tech. Wakanda's history really doesn't have much to do with the rest of Africa.&&They seem to be downplaying a lot of the african-ness in the marketing though. Like the music for example &&As is the case with all Marvel movies.&&You mean just like every major superhero movie?&&We talkin’ yellow Asian or brown Asian? /s&&[removed]&&Only if you're dark enough. You'd better not look too white.&&The high percentage of college degrees and low poverty rate in the Asian community says you are not POC. 

You are only POC if the white man keeps you down. &&Actually, I’ve seen a few petitions and GoFundMes started to send only black kids to the movie. I imagine what would have happened if Mexicans bought a theater full of tickets for kids to see CoCo. &&just drop a few ""dawg"" instead of ""ese"" and you'll be fine &&Essentially, that's what the comic version of Wakanda is.  It's a highly technologically advanced civilization, (also the richest on the planet,) that deliberately isolates itself and refuses to aid the world with advances such as ""the cure to cancer"".  

To some degree at least, the movie appears to follow the spirit of the comic-version of Wakanda.&&This is basically a screening only for black people it seems like. Or at least it appears to be a screening that bars white people since it's intended for brown people only.&&I wonder what the reaction would be if there was an ""all white"" screening for a superhero movie...&&Wasn't it the leader of the black Panthers that said race is an artificial construct, and the real divide is rich and poor?

I guess so long as the poor people fight amongst themselves over skin colour and culture, the rich can just sit back and relax.&&That'd be racist. &&Ronnie: Suck it, ""Reindeer Games""!

Danny: That's true, I am white.&&or make black kids buy more black panther comics. &&IIRC this movie has the most pre-sales of any MCU movie so far, so that marketing has certainly worked.

There is a theater in Diberville, where a lot of shopping is located, right on the edge of the Jackson County line. The bulk of Jackson County covers rural areas north of I-10, with the population density being along the interstate.

According to this thread, driving 15 minutes to see a movie is ""fucking hell.""&&The stat is so misleading. There are 3 large multiplex theaters all within a stones throw of Jackson MS city limits. Pearl, Flowood, and Madison all have 15+ screen theaters and border the city.

I live in Jackson now and it's alright. &&I am not real familiar with the area but it looks like on Google maps that most of Jackson is within about 20 minutes of a theater and that there are 4 theaters on the Eastern side of town.&&This is the case.  There are 4 theaters within 2 to 3 miles of the city limits.  The city of Jackson has extremely high tax rates and property taxes so most businesses locate themselves just outside the city.  Madison and Flowood Mississippi(which boarder Jackson) are 2 of the most well off cities in the state mainly because they have all the businesses that left Jackson.   &&Yeah there are 3 within 15 minutes of Jackson proper. &&This is correct. There’s a couple in the area but they’re a few miles outside the city limits. Also Jackson did have a theatre at one point, but it closed a couple years ago.&&Its not because of economics , it is because of crime. anything within city limits is too dangerous to have families and kids hanging out.&&Is this not the market in action? Why hasn't a black person opened a theater themselves? Is there no profit to be made? Is there a reason there are no theaters in the area? Did there used to be theaters? If so, what happened to them?

While most of my favorite movies have to do with struggles I deal with to this day, other media with characters that have similarities to me will always have a place in my heart because they helped me accept myself growing up.

Hancock was on its way to being one of my favorite movies before the weird star crossed super hero love story. 

So many ways they could have taken that. General redemption. Redemption meets government conspiracy to allow drug crime to contain communities. Redemption meets grappling with the new healthy lifestyle and how to stay consistent healthy. Etc. 

Instead ""God made both of us for each other but if we hang out we can die"". Derp&&Oh yeah! 

also CapAm: Civil War, while headlined by two white dudes, had no less than four black dude superheroes: Nick Fury, Falcon, Warmachine, Black Panther. Not that any of that is a good or bad thing, but still worth noting.

The theater was in a town of a few thousand, but not ours. Seems misleading to say Jackson doesn't have a place to go just because it's 10 minutes out, or you need a ride.

I guess it's underserved for theaters---but that seems to cover a ton of places in the country.

Pretty sure it's not released in full quality.&&Already exploding here o reddit with porn. /r/deepfakes&&>  I wonder how long it will be before someone's appearance can be licensed? 

Certainly something worth exploring.  Or what about this?  Famous actor digitizes themselves, then sells the rights to use them in a film.  Film uses body double to actually film, then replaces double in post with digitized actor.  Actor has to do zero work other than updating digitized files to play older characters while retaining younger files for younger characters.  Theoretically, the rights could be inherited by the actor's estate and continue to be used even after death. Studio can pay the doubles a lot less.  The only tricky bit is dialogue, which could be dubbed until realistic voiceprint and replacement becomes a thing.

Nothing will be ""real"" anymore.&&You're giving some celebrities $$$ ideas here if they see this!!!&&> I wonder how long it will be before someone's appearance can be licensed?

> We're used to Photoshopped images these days, but faking video and audio is still labour-intensive, right? Unfortunately, that's a nope: we're seeing first generation AI-assisted video porn, in which the faces of film stars are mapped onto those of other people in a video clip using software rather than a laborious human process. (Yes, of course porn is the first application: Rule 34 of the Internet applies.) Meanwhile, we have WaveNet, a system for generating realistic-sounding speech in the voice of a human speaker the neural network has been trained to mimic. This stuff is still geek-intensive and requires relatively expensive GPUs. But in less than a decade it'll be out in the wild, and just about anyone will be able to fake up a realistic-looking video of someone they don't like doing something horrible.  
 

[transscript](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html)&&Yeah, all you would need to do to destroy a political opponent would be to find a piece of amateur porn where one of the people on screen has the same height, weight, body type, age, and any distinguishing features as your target. Then you just replace their face and make sure there isn’t a single copy of the original on the internet anywhere so no one can prove it predates the fake. Should probably track down the original performers and pay them off too, just to be safe. Then release the tape and hope you haven’t missed anything or the whole thing could blow up in your face. &&It depends on how knowledgeable the general public is to the whole thing. If someone published a nude picture of Donald Trump right now, a strong case could be made that it's possibly photoshopped. Give it a few years, and the same will happen to video evidence.

That opens a whole other can of worms, of course, because it means more and more actual evidence can be dismissed. But the technology is coming anyway, so it's best that it's in the hands of the public, educating as many people as possible that video evidence might not be as reliable as it once was.&&Mix this with Adobe's software that can take a few sentences of data from a recorded voice to make the say almost anything and you have complete replacements.

I'm so glad I'm no longer in school.&&Also, what makes a person famous in acting is going to change in the short term (at least before we can make utterly realistic depictions from whole cloth) -- currently, to be a good actor you need to have the appropriate look *and* some modicum of acting ability, but decoupling these will mean that your digitized face can come from any random individual who looks the part, and the ""body double"" can be hired purely on the basis of how well they can act. People might still be interested in seeing *particular* faces, but if this sort of decoupling goes mainstream I imagine that desire would fade, too. Hell, if anything, I'd rather get a fresh face in every movie, so that I stop seeing e.g. adult Harry Potter in every movie Daniel Radcliffe stars in.

With the way technology is progressing, though, I'd be unsurprised if within the next handful of decades or maybe half century* you could specify that you want actors with these general features, and also here's the script; let the algorithm go beep-boop for an hour and fill in the remaining details and out would pop some fully realized movie (or 3D Virtual Reality Story or whatever) indistinguishable from an actual performance with world class acting, CG effects, camerawork, etc. Hell, even superhuman acting ability -- I imagine actual actors still fall short of both realism in the moment, perceived realism, and entertainingness.

Of course, this would only be to satisfy one's personal curiosity and desire to create -- *everyone* knows that the best '3DVRS's come from computer generated ""scripts"" calibrated specifically to satisfy the comprehensive aesthetic profile and current desires of its viewers in real time...

If we thought fake news was a problem now, just wait until there's easily faked video to back up whatever narrative someone wants.  Reality is taking a vacation.

Edit: lots of folks are saying that this could be done for years with Photoshop, but that's missing the key takeaway: machine learning removes the human from the equation, and can be trained from its mistakes.

As soon as someone creates software to identify fakes, the model can be trained against that software until it defeats it.

This is not a full blown AI, but the fundamental concept of  *learning* at inhuman speeds is present with these processes.

Previously, anything we wanted a computer to do required us to know how to do it, and teach (program) the computer to do that task.  With machine learning, we give it a starting point and a at of good examples and bad ones, and the software figures out how to create the good ones.  The more data, and the more variations of examples, the more accurate it becomes.

So basically they *ensure* many these kids they're making millions off of can't afford to eat out or buy things then act all outraged when someone gets busted accepting free meals/stuff.&&It's certainly fucked how they aren't paid for their work and are barred from making money based in that work.  But assuming they were properly compensated, I don't think it's absurd that the NCAA would have rights to the player's name and likeness for the time they were in college for perpetuity.  They obviously would run afoul if they used anything outside of that, but to me it seems like showing and old game. And players don't have to be paid royalties for replays of games, because they were already compensated.  

Now of course the other problem is that players should certainly have the right to play while not giving their permission and being free to sell the use of their likeness on their own.&&Was there any precedent?

The machine learning model that would determine it is fake can just as easily be used to further train the model that creates the fake until eventually it's perfected.

Without access to the source videos, discovering fakes becomes much harder to do, as you have less material to train the model against than what the people who create the fakes will have.

It's a deeply, deeply ominous development.

Radiolab did a good episode that touched on this:

http://www.radiolab.org/story/breaking-news/&&Courts have software to detect when a photo is Photoshopped, and it's darn easy, when you have thousands of frames in a video , there's gonna be a fuck up somewhere, we'll be fine.&&Take the deepfakes, and throw in some legit fappening stuff, and no one would know it wasn’t just one of the fakes. 

It takes the value out of the celebrity nudes if the fakes are visually indistinguishable from the fakes. 

And, like all things with visual effects, it isn’t difficult to analyze the video and determine it is a fake. It’s not like it could be used to convict someone of a murder... it wouldn’t be hard to find it’s a fake if you look close enough. 

The thing is, there aren’t great laws regarding likeness. Do we, by default, own our own faces?  If not, there is nothing stopping a movie production from just putting big celebrities in their movies this way. As they already do with dead people, to my dismay. When you’re dead, who owns your face then?  Is it your heirs, public domain, does it die with you?  These are legal questions we really should have answered the minute those fucking disrespectful snickers commercials started using dead people. &&""Yer a wizard Harry!"" - Nicolas Cage

"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is an absolute masterpiece.",41636,7thjne,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7thjne/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_absolute/,2003,1517106832.0,"I just watched this with my two-year old daughter, I was enthralled the whole time. By the end, I was crying, shocked at how much I became invested in the story. So much passion and creativity in every frame of the movie. I got a very Studio Ghibli vibe from the whole thing. My only regret is not seeing it on the big screen. I'll say it again, it's a masterpiece, and one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen.

Edit: I love the passion this movie has generated! It's okay if you didn't like it as much as I did, and I find a lot of the replies I got from people who loved it were from parents. I think the view of parenthood frames this movie differently; I probably wouldn't have liked it as much even 10 years ago. Thanks for all the replies and movie recommendations!","All of the Laika films are absolutely stunning.

And yes, quality stop motion is entirely fascinating on the big screen.
Coraline was basically THE posterchild for how 3D movies should be.
Not a tagged on gimmick, well done in every aspect, and used in effects that just don't have the same impact in 2D (like the vanishing world or the spiderweb)&&If you must blink, do it now.&&I loved the movie but there was one scene that (for some reason) blew me away. In the credits where the awesome music is playing ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" there is a scene where they work on the skeleton dude in a quick time-lapse. They cut it so that the skeleton started moving at the same time the song went into a climax. That kind of send chills down my spine.

[Edit: Here it is.](https://youtu.be/0xxAAXZvCO8?t=183)&&Also Regina Spektors version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is amazing. &&I had some issues with the story/writing, but I liked it enough. Up-voting so more people can see it and support Laika. I believe their last few films have flopped, and it would be a real shame if they closed doors because what they are doing is beautiful and unique. The American animation industry desperately needs studios that make mature animated features like theirs.&&Solid movie but I wish they did more with the mythical weapons.   They spent the entire film hyping them up for them to play next to no role in the final battle.  &&Were you able to predict the ""twists"" or were they a surprise for you?
I personally thought the twists were way too obvious. Gorgeous visuals though..&&This is a really interesting discussion. I never thought this would be such a polarising movie!

Personally, I loved it. The visuals were the best I've ever seen in a stop motion animation, both technically and artistically. The story is pretty much a standard hero's journey, which is all well and good. 

Where the movie really stands out for me is thematically. It looks at masculinity in a unique and interesting way: boy (Kubo), man (Kubo's dad and beetle) [yes, i'm treating them as two separate characters](#spoiler), patriarch (the moon king) and dotard (post-battle moon king). They are all different aspects of the same person, showing a man's life in five acts all interacting with each other.

The voice acting was mixed. Monkey was bad. Flat and boring. Kubo was good, and his aunts were great. The rest were somewhere in between.

Since this has turned into an essay, I thought I should add a conclusion.&&I saw the movie in theaters. Gorgeous movie. However for a multitude of reasons, I felt the story fell apart in the final act despite a very strong beginning. I don't think the character development was handled well. It became a very confused movie, and I only wish the plot has as much care and detail put into it as the animation and visual effects. It turned Kubo and the Two Strings from a movie that I knew I would be periodically rewatching for the rest of my life to a movie I would not care to watch again.

It did have a lot of great moments though and the [IT MADE ME STRONG!](#spoiler) revelation was amazing.&&Fantastic production design and a sweet, melancholic adventure that was unfortunately overlooked at the box office...plus that boat fight was straight money... &&Named my dog Kubo. Thought it was aight. &&> I got a very Studio Ghibli vibe 

Interesting, I never really felt it and I've watched a *lot* of Studio Ghibli movies. Would you mind elaborating on that a bit?&&I'm sure there is one somewhere but I don't see A SINGLE COMMENT MENTIONING SHAMISEN. Seriously, shout outs to everyone else who plays, shout outs to Kevin Kmetz the guy who played it for this movie, shout outs to Bachido the shamisen community and everyone who likes the instrument. I've only been playing for a year or so but it's such an underappreciated instrument. Also I think this comment puts me at 1000 karma yay&&It looked amazing.&&Maybe you could help me here, because I didn't get the ending. I really liked most of the movie, but the ending [looked like the villagers were taking advantage of an old man that just lost his memory.] (#spoiler) Ended up leaving a weird aftertaste.  
&&Kubo is *visually* probably the most stunning stop-motion film ever made (though at this point, there's always a question of how much of that is done through computer animation).

But story-wise, I think it's one of Laika's weakest films, and would put both Coraline and BoxTrolls above it in that regard. Still a damn good movie though (they always do great work).&&[deleted]&&Can we just take a moment to appreciate the amazing cover of While My Guitar Gently Weeps during the credits?&&I thought the movie was a solid 7/10, the ending was meh. 


I must say though that the end credits started and I almost had a heart attack. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is one of my favorite songs of all time, and I adore listening to different covers of it. Regina Spektor did an amazing job and I loved the instrumentals. I listened to that cover every day for a while there &&I absolutely loved it. Why I agree with some of the flaws people have pointed out, for me it wasn't enough to detract from my enjoyment of the film.

I definitely cried. &&Man everyone is really hating on this movie, but I'm with you OP. Easily one of the top 5 animated movies I've ever seen. I'd put it up there with Howl's Moving Castle honestly. I was hooked the whole time.&&Laika did deliver on this. Loved the story. It was a touching movie with awesome craft.&&I disagree, saw it recently and it didn't really move me, felt like it was decent but it kinda forced it's message, pacing felt a little odd too. 

Interesting and quirky movie but I don't think it's really a master piece. &&Ugh, the word ""masterpiece"" is taken way too lightly. Let's face it... very few things are truly a masterpiece. Kubo may be a pretty good film but a masterpiece it ain't! &&Yes! I loved every second of it! I love the story and you know that type of animation requires some real commitment. I love that movie and it’s a shame that I don’t hear about it that much.&&Not a masterpiece, but a solid movie. &&I thought it was mediocre at best.&&I actually really disagree.

The beginning was phenomenal and got my really excited for the rest of the movie. The middle was pretty good too, but man was that ending completely disappointing. I expected so much more...&&The first act was phenomenal and I was watching thinking it could really be something special. But then the second act just fell apart and became broad. They felt like they needed to introduce comical sidekicks and it took something away from it &&This is one of those movies that I can say is an absolute work of art. &&I really could not disagree more. I thought the visuals were impeccable but the script was garbage. and I don’t mean “this is a kids movie“ but “even a child would be insulted by this script”. Pixar movies have a script that both adults and children can relate to but the script for this movie was so juvenile I could not wait for the movie to end. I was awestruck by how little I like this movie especially after all of the praise. &&It's actually not that great honestly. The movie has some solid parts to it, and the stop motion work is indeed top notch, but the ending is just terrible, they even repeatedly mention during the movie that they just don't know what to do for the ending, and they were very much right. Basically if you are impressed with this movie you REALLY need to see everything else made by Laika, as this is probably their worst film, despite still being pretty good, it's just that everything else they have done have been off the charts, I'm especially fond of Paranorman myself..&&I was bored for the most part, then MAJORLY pissed off when Kubo brainwashed his grandfather to make him a good guy. What the hell hero?&&The BTS credits sequence gave me chills. I was so disappointed they didn’t win the Oscar for that one because it showed how much time and effort Laika puts into their movies&&I hadn't heard of this film but I saw that Regina Spektor was involved in the soundtrack and that was enough to pique my interest. The rest of you make me want to watch it more. Sounds like I'm missing out on something.&&I've got a lot to say about the plot to this movie lol. I will preface by saying despite the shortcomings and the ways I see to improve them, I still genuinely love this movie and think it's a fantastic piece of animation. But, on to the opinion piece (spoiling the entire ending here, ye've been warned).

[The Moon King's comeuppance. Okay, this one really truly bothered me. Erasing his memory and convincing him he was always a nice guy is an incredibly morally grey ending that I didn't like at all. Considering he already had one of Kubo's eyes, I would've thought they could have him ""see the true value of family"" and come to live honestly among the people rather than having to completely erase his history. The Moon King learning to redeem himself through kindness would've been a much more emotionally impactful and honest ending in my opinion, and effectively brainwashing him to be kind is a bit of a cop-out. I loved everything up until this resolution and it still bugs me.](#spoiler)

[I also thought that the story would've been better suited had he not found his true dad and mom until he prayed at the same grave he prayed at in the beginning. I thought that the Monkey guardian and his father's lieutenant were perfect as surrogate parents for the adventure. Because the reveal happens so close to their 'true' deaths it made the impact of his mother's death seem less meaningful while also taking away from their actual death because we'd already seen/heard about them dying before.](#spoiler)

[Also y u no have Little Hanzo become Big Hanzo and have Kubo defeat the Moon Beast using a giant fuck-off origami samurai?](#spoiler)&&I saw it with some friends a couple of days after it came out in cinemas. It was on a Saturday afternoon and I think the movie was released on the Thursday or Friday before that. We didn't go to the cinema specifically to see that movie, we just wanted to meet up and decided on Kubo in the end. We were going to the cinema at the O2 in Greenwich, London. Which is a pretty busy and well known place. Being the risk averse person I am, I booked tickets for the four of us the day before, and braced myself to for what I presumed would be a screen filled with kids: Given that it was an animated movie that had come out days before, and we were going on a Saturday afternoon. But when we eventually got to screen it was pretty much empty. There were two to three groups of other 20 somethings in there and that was it. The fact it was such a good movie with such a good critical reception makes it even worse that it didn't really perform well. I don't know if it was a failure in marketing or something else that led to poor ticket sales but they definitely didn't deserve that&&I absolutely loved it! &&Personally, I found it a bit disappointing. I still liked it, but it starts dropping in quality after the first act. The first act was, dare I say it, perfect. But then they add a comic relief character, and the story starts to add a bit too much. The twist is a bit problematic, and the final scene kinda made me roll my eyes. It's not as strong in writing as it is in visuals, because oh my god, the visuals are gorgeous.&&What is the matter with me? I watched the first 10-15 minutes and was so bored I turned it off. Didn't care about the character, was only mildly interested in the world. Can someone please help me with this?&&Caught it when it was playing at cinemas and was tearing up HARD at the end. Subsequent viewings have made me full on getting choked up. By far the best damn movie I saw in 2016. It hit me on a very personal level like so few films do.&&Man there's a lot of hate in here but I'm totally with ya OP.

Hey, have you seen [the theory that Kubo is a sequel](https://youtu.be/MjUHa9paDAI)?&&It’s one of my favorite movies. I love everything about it. I can watch it over and over again.&&Have you watched Coco yet?&&Interesting! I saw it with a group of friends (none of us real movie snobs) and we all agreed to turn it off and watch something else. I don't know what it was. The animation was absolutely stunning, but I felt like the story didn't really engage me at all. And I can't really say why. I really wanted to like it too&&It's not that good.&&Have heard nothing but great things about it. Even more excited to watch it now.&&If you're in Portland OR in the next few months, the company that produced it, LAIKA, has a large exhibit in the Portland Art Museum (Bank of America customers can go to the museum free during the first weekend of every month if that helps motivate anyone). Their stop-motion is amazing and art direction is absolutely astounding. The giant skeleton with the swords in it's skull is in there, and so is the garden from Coraline. It's damn amazing.

Or go on YouTube and watch the behind the scenes time lapse of Kubo's animation.&&Me too, I'm surprised at how many commenters think it was mediocre! I felt the same way as you. I never buy movies on DVD but I made sure to get this one, one of my new favorite films ever&&No it isn't. Spirited Away is a masterpiece. The Lion King is a cultural milestone and most likely a masterpiece. 

kubo and the Two Strings isn't even the best Laika film. It's technically proficient and absolutely gorgeous, but the story is unrewarding (in my opinion) and it lacks emotional heft to the heavy themes introduced in the first half of the film. 

Of course this is just my cynical opinion. I'm not usually a huge fan of kids films in general. &&A real piece of art.  Honestly, so much attention to detail went into that I am amazed it isn't talked about more often.&&I was visiting Portland Oregon while a huge stop motion exhibit was at the art museum.

It was called [Animating Life](https://portlandartmuseum.org/exhibitions/animating-life/)

Absolutely enthralling.

We walked the whole museum in a day and spent over an hour in the exhibition room.

The work is just breathtaking.

The sheer amount of detail in one frame is mind boggling.

We re-watched Coraline on the flight home.

Kubo is a great flick.&&I felt like it kinda dragged on, and the message of the film conflicted with the ending.&&Is it up for an Oscar nomi ation?&&Saw it at the theater specifically because the trailers looked really cool, and it was one of the best kids movies I've ever seen. Right up there with anything Ghibli or Disney ever put out.

Agree 100%, and the Guitar Gently Weeps cover is so fitting, and so good from Regina Spektor.&&Ahh damn thanks, I forgot about this film but I really wanted to see it. Looks like todays is the day.&&I agree! I really loved it. The style fit well and the story was a nice refresher from the norm. I don't think I saw it in theaters but a sinling did and enjoyed it IIRC.&&> By the end, I was crying, shocked at how much I became invested in the story.

I watched it and didn't experienced any of that. And please, don't compare this to Miyazaki's work, there's no similarity besides Japanese culture and characters.&&I scrolled passed it for months before giving in because there was nothing else to watch. Holy fuck was this movie absolutely amazing&&Kuuuuuuubooooo...little boy, what happened to your eye? *laughs evilly*&&If you liked Kubo I’m sure you’ll love Coco ! It’s also about a little boy with his guitar, but that’s about where the comparison stops. I watched it yesterday and frankly I was crying like a little baby at the end. It’s all the more touching if you have a loved one who has Alzheimer’s or died recently. Seriously go watch it and tell me what you think about it !
&&The only reason I watched it was cause of a Reddit post from someone who had the same reaction to it as you and urged everyone to watch it. It was possibly in this same sub. Being the obedient person I am, I went to watch it the next day. It was an amazing movie and the big screen added so much to the experience.&&It was ok.&&It's a visual masterpiece but the story and script is pretty weak imo. &&I would disagree. I think the movie is great, but that’s entirely based on the visuals. The story itself is pretty boring and completely standard.&&i feel like kubo and Coraline are the best movies ever made in 3d stop-motion. made by the same people too. &&There seems to be a large group of people who felt the ending was unsatisfying in part because they felt the Moon King didn't get an appropriate punishment for his actions.  His punishment was the worst that could possibly be done to his character.  

The Moon family are flat as characters specifically because they scorn humanity.  They see Kubo's mother's choice to humanize herself as irrational and weak, so beneath them that they must purge her rather than be tainted by association.

One of the major messages I took from the movie is that it is precisely our irrational choices and the stories (true or not) that we tell about ourselves that make us human.  

The Moon King never manages to strip the humanity from Monkey and Beetle, no matter whether they have human bodies or their true memories.  They are still bickering and posturing and loving each other, making messes and trying to string them together in new stories.  The Moon family rejects all that, and locks itself into dispassionate exercise of power.

There could be no more humiliating end in the eyes of the Moon King than being human, and nothing more humanizing than doing things out of love for others.   I think the ""love conquers all"" message people find trite isn't actually the message of the movie.  Love humanizes all, maybe.  Mostly, the message is that we become the stories we tell about ourselves, and the powerful, unique, and *human* ones are about love.&&Wow, I just finished watching this with my wife and came to make this exact post.  Fantastic Film!&&I love that film, their best work imo&&The movie is predictable and overrated.&&I will tend to agree with you, especially because I find the cinematography in that movie absolutely amazing, which is not something I usually notice in animated movies of all kinds.&&I absolutely loved this movie. Was disappointed it lost to Zootopia in the Oscars.&&Coraline... now THAT'S a masterpiece!&&Beautiful animation, story was lame as fuck. Literally no more creativity than a Skyrim fetch quest in a nowhere village. &&I have to vehemently disagree.

As a children's movie it's good. The story falls pretty flat, even for a children's movie, and there's nothing particularly amazing about the visuals when compared to other movies.

As a movie in general it's just ... so bad. The story takes a lot of actions that you really only see in a children's movie, and the comedy relief character is definitely polarizing. I could take the time to go in depth but I'd rather go in depth about:

Laika is crap and I hate them all. I know people who work for Laika. I know how their production design works. I could actually rant about how much I dislike them all day, but I will attempt to summarize everything into a few sentences. Their entire public image, how they sell their movies, is a lie. It's debatable if you can call what they do stop motion at this point. Huge amounts of their moves are just flat out digitally animated and the entirety of every movie gets a lot of digital effects added afterwards. On top of that their stop motion mannequins are actually incredibly basic. They render the entire file in 3d animation software, then 3d print most frames and snap them only their crappy mannequins. They do this for most of the character's movement and all facial movements. They might as well just do the whole film in a computer, at least then they would be more honest about their process, but the rich kid who started Laika likes to play with dolls. It's the only reason the studio exists.&&Thought it was boring tbh &&It's always been a great film.... Very few says it's not good. &&O yea, buy far. The stop motion is enough to win everything, across the board. The writing is fiction out of Godley hands. And the the fucking acting. 

It's just a masterpieace. I went with my mother, who I don't go to see movies with becuase she is so intelligent movies are boring for her. She much more intelligent than me. 

She actually enjoyed dissecting the movie and explains the imagery and focus behind the movie. It was truly a memorable experince. &&Kubo and the Two Strings is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Its only selling point is that there were physical props.

The story is weak, just a generic fetch quest with elements appropriated from Journey West. Getting beating over the head by a handful of arc words over and over again doesn't make the fucking thing poetic. (And I swear, every single time Kubo says, ""And that's just the least of it,"" I want to scream, ""THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOST OF IT? BECAUSE YOU JUST SUMMARIZED THE WHOLE FUCKING STORY THUS FAR!"")

And the worst part is how shockingly ableist the story is. Kubo's mother is suffering from dementia after head trauma, but it's Kubo that the movie tries to make us feel sorry for. It the mother burdeningnKubo. And then all that relentless shitting on blind people! Like the bit about Kubo's grandfather wanting to steal Kubo's eyes because blind people can't see souls and this it would harden Kubo's heart (if I'm remembering it more or less correctly). Holy fuck! Imagine how blind kids feel when they're confronted with this shitbag of a movie.

You know what movie came out at a similar time and competed for box office revenue? Finding Dory. **That** was a masterpiece.

Studio Laika is fucking useless. Their stories are shallow, bland, syrupy, and often insensitive. Their only schtick is that their movies are all stop motion, with a ton of effort devoted to practical effects. But even that's a flimsy distinction, because almost all their shit is built on Stratasys J750 machines these days. And you can't claim the subtle jitter makes it worthwhile, because even that can be convincingly simulated, as Dreamworks' proved with Trolls.&&Highly recommend if you liked this movie and live in the Portland area to check out the Laika studios exhibit at the Art Museum. I checked it out a month ago and it was such a treat to see all the pieces and sets they used. Aside from Kudo stuff they also had: Boxtrolls, Coraline, and ParaNorman as well. Free days: first Thursday of the month 5-8pm or first full weekend if you have a Bank of America Card!&&It's good but it is held back by *the chumpest death ever*.&&I had the privilege to visit the studio during production.  Did a presentation and got a tour.  I cannot even begin to describe how amazing it was.  The artists are masters in their craft and were incredibly kind.  Each dept was mind-baffeling unique.  It felt like Disneyworld.  The skeleton was the most impressive in addition to the boat fight scene... saw it mid-poses while animators were working.  The skeleton was three stories tall at least.  Incredible.&&For what it's worth, I watched the movie in Korean and I thoroughly enjoyed the voice acting. 
 
In fact, the voice acting was so good in the Korean version, my Korean wife had to stop watching the movie because the two aunts demonic voice seemed too ""authentic."" 
 
I enjoyed the ending and am surprised to see so many people didn't like it. Then again, I'm a sucker for stories like this, so.&&Yup, this movie is so fantastic I gave my kitten the name Kubo.&&I basically just adore this movie. Did you know that the Red Skeleton in the Hall of Bones is the largest stop-motion puppet ever built, at about 17 feet tall and with a 20 foot armspan?&&Thanks, I've been debating if I should watch it for awhile - hadn't heard anything about it until now though&&Way better than my neighbor who does nothing for 99% of the movie... lol&&You have no idea how much I promoted this movie to my friends. The first time I saw it was movie hopping so I hadn't paid for it only for the other movie I saw and I felt so guilty because it was so good I went to see it again so I could pay for it &&Why do you have to say you watched it a 2 year old? &&Not really a kids movie &&i work in 3d printing and learned recently the company who makes this film has numerous stratasys J750 machines (high end resin printers with color etc) and the entire film is 3d printed models. Very cool need to watch this with my 2 year old&&There's an untitled Laika film slated for this year. Worried it's delayed since there's been no news but hopefully something is heard soon.&&One of those movie that I was upset didn't do better both financially and critically. It was an absolutely amazing experience &&Huh.  I was really excited for this movie from the (excellent) trailer.  And after seeing it I thought:  ""Well, that was an OK movie.""&&That movie really hit me. Before she passed, my mother would go into focal seizures which, for her, looked like the blank trance his mother would go into.. And how she'd forget things, and then cry. She was relatively young, just 48, it.. Well, I'm a grown ass man, and the feelings it stirred made me cry like a bitch.&&Yeah, I know! It's so frigging beautiful! You should see some of Cartoon Saloon's films (and even their TV shows for kids!). They're 2D animated, but they're so frigging beautiful.

*The Secret of Kells* is the most beautiful film I've ever seen.

&&[If any of you are going to be in Portland, Oregon between now and May 20, 2018, there is a Laika exhibit at Portland Art Museum](https://portlandartmuseum.org/exhibitions/animating-life/)&&Coraline is still my best experience viewing any film in 3D. I'd definitely pay to see it again on big screen.&&It kind of sucks that they haven't done so well in theaters. Looking up the numbers on Kubo made me sad.&&If you like stop motion you should see Fantastic Mr Fox directed by Wes Anderson. One of my favorite movies of all time.&&The theme of embracing your enemy over killing them is one that we all need to consider more often. &&It's weird. Read the book LOOOOONG time ago, but have yet to watch the movie.&&I went to Coraline on the big screen and it scared the absolute shit out of me. Couldn't believe it was PG tbh. I remember the cinema having like 4 other people in it. I think we left early...&&Coraline is still the only movie I felt the 3D truly enhanced. Yes, Avatar looked neat in 3D, and Tron as well. However, in both of those cases, it felt constantly ""isn't this CRAZY?! Threeee-DEEEE!"", to the point that it detracted from my enjoyment of the visuals at times.&&The best intro to an animated movie since the Lion King!&&[We didn't](https://i.imgur.com/sD5jfQR.jpg)&&Or in Kubo's case, wink.&&I was so in love with the song I sat through the credits at the theater. So good. &&Regina Spektor (spelling?) does that cover if I'm not mistaken, absolutely amazing song.&&I had known that kubo was stop motion long before seeing it, but had forgotten by the time i actually saw it. Then, cue credits, and they show that clip, and chills everywhere as i realized that everything i had seen in the past hour and a half was stop motion.

GOD. DAMN. INCREDIBLE.&&that part with the behind the scenes with the skeleton was so memorable for me too :)&&I love how even the ending credits are a work of art!&&That is why you ALWAYS put respekt on Regina Spektor.  &&That was really cool&&Yeah ... for me many times the making of tends to be, sadly, more interesting than the movie itself.&&I love the song, but I’m always bummed about how little credit the shamisen player gets &&https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_zagM1Memfw&&The end credits scene in general while that song plays is nicely done.&&TIL that's Regina Spektor. No wonder it's so good. &&Laika is basically a pet project of Phil Knight (co-founder of Nike and 28th richest person in the world) and his son Travis (who is a stop-motion animator). I don't think they actually care if they make money on the films, they just want to make stop motion animated movies. It's not in any huge danger of going under.&&Laika is owned by the co-founder of Nike and seems to be under no threat of going under, in fact they downsized their 3D animation studio to upscale their stop motion studio and to all accounts are on the rise. Boxtrolls and Paranorman made millions more than their prodution budget, Kubo made back it's production budget as well. 

The films are making money and none of them have been financial failures which is a real achievement in itself.&&Phil Knight is bankrolling his son Travis who runs Laika. They are in zero danger of failing financially. Shit, if Phil was willing to pay for Travis to do a rap record in the 90s I’m sure he’s happy to pay for something a bit more constructive. [No I’m not kidding](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y14dDzGPFbs)&&Agreed. It is a disgrace that schlock like *The Emoji Movie* drastically outgrossed *Kubo.*&&Thank god I’m not the only one thinking the same. I thought I had something wrong with my analysis seeing how everyone loved the movie. The characters apart from the boy ultimately felt flat to me too. I’d need to watch it again to make a better judgment, it’s been a year since.

Coraline was great though.&&I have a major gripe with the ending of the movie. The message I got was “it’s okay to lie and cover up someone’s past for the sake of communal peace”. I think that’s a...terrible lesson to teach? I’m kinda surprised that not many people took issue with this, so I guess this is just my personal gripe. If anyone wants to change my view on this, the stage is yours&&I'm pretty sure Kevin Parry, an animator from Laika, uploaded something about making movies at Laika yesterday. Like, they're working on a new one.&&While we're commending animation studios, I feel like Aardman Animations deserves a shout out. Wallace & Gromit and the Curse of the Wererabbit is one of my favorite movies of any genre, it's just pure fun and you can tell that so much time and effort went into the animation. I also love their movie Pirates! (Forget the full title, but that movie is equally as funny but for some reason lesser known than W&G). But yeah, quality animation is so awesome and so valuable and I hope that enough people continue to support these studios. &&Paranorman, Boxtrolls, and Kubo. Oh how I wish people didn't see stop motion as childrens films. They're for everyone no matter the occasion.&&I agree. I tried showing it to several kids in addition to my own and none of them latched onto it. I think generally they like the visuals but either don't understand or care about the story. &&I guess because it wasn't about the sword, shield, and helmet. Obtaining those were just goal posts on Kubo's journey of self-discovery. By the end of his journey he had gained enough wisdom to save the day. That was his true weapon.&&Yeah but they had a narratively good reason why. The love of his parents gave him the power to beat the moon king. One of the core themes of the movie is Kubo finding (metaphorically and literally) his family. &&[deleted]&&Yeah, as soon as Monkey was revealed, I immediately figured the rest out, but it didn't really make it any less exciting. Knowing the outcome doesn't mean you immediately know the whole story. I mean, we all know The Avengers will defeat Thanos in the end, but we're all going to go see it anyways!&&I'll admit, I rather liked Monkey's voice acting. I think her flat, somewhat hassled delivery acted as an amusing foil to Kubo and Beetle and kept me from realizing who she truly was until much later.&&I absolutely agree with you. The visuals are phenomenal and were by far the best thing about the movie. There were some pretty creative ideas in there; I liked Kubo's origami powers. I found everything else lacking, though.&&I'm generally the wide-eyed golly gee movie goer that gets suckered in by emotional pulls. I generally evaluate a film in my head later on and decide if I liked it or not.

That said, I walked out after this movie visibly crying in public. I held my wife, I called my parents. I have a 3 month old son and I dream of the day I can show this to him, and dread the day when he watches it and understands that I will die and leave him some day.

On retrospect, I really liked it because of what it causes me to think about and how I act based on those thoughts.&&The story was forgettable... I know because I watched this movie only a year ago and I don't remember the story anymore. I just remember the animation being stunning. However, name any Pixar movie even a decade old (except Cars series *cough*) and I'll remember the story even though some of the animation back then wasn't as good as the animation in Kubo. You'd think they'd spend more time on the story before spending so much time on the stop animation&&Monkey was the best voice, imo. *shrug*&&Completely agreed. Fantastic film, very much enjoyed it, but the third act was underwhelming for me too. I get why people say they like the ending, it just didn't do much for me. So you're not alone.&&it felt like they made some story changes during production and how it was stop motion they couldn't really go back and redo the entire thing. the visuals and animation was amazing but the story really holds it back. &&> I saw the movie in theaters. Gorgeous movie. However for a multitude of reasons, I felt the story fell apart in the final act despite a very strong beginning.

Also saw it in the theater, and I feel very similarly. I wanted to love this movie, and I still wish more people had seen it, but the final act felt like a letdown.&&I think it was just too much plot crammed into too small of a movie, and ended up feeling super rushed. The movie was 100 minutes long and it had 5 major set pieces, each of which was like 5-10 minutes long. There's the first confrontation with the aunts, the fight with the skeleton, the fight on the lake, the ambush at the temple, and the final confrontation with the moon king. That doesn't leave much time for actual character development or relationships.

As a result I didn't think that any of the emotional moments really felt earned. It was hard for me to feel sad about Kubo losing his father when they had only had like two conversations prior to that in the entire movie. And then the ending tried to go all serious and thematic about the *importance of memory*, but it seemed to come out of nowhere because they never had time to really explore those ideas during the movie.&&Yeah, I assumed they used CGI for the chain-blade thing the evil sister was using...nope. That thing is 100% hand animated. I've never seen such fluidity in stop-motion animation before.&&Good dog name.&&I'd contend (very cynically) that one of the reasons people are blown away by how creative this movie is is because they're really unfamiliar with Japanese culture and/or Asian tropes in general. 

Like the whole idea of there being a celestial court and stealing an eye from a person being a totally fine thing to do that has a magical effect and lanterns on the river and paper having spiritual powers etc, all of that is pretty standard to folklore in Japan, but definitely not in Western media. 

Without that, I really don't find much similar between this movie and Ghibli movies. There's themes of family and discovering oneself, which I guess are pretty Ghibli-esque, but most Ghibli stuff isn't really big on the Hero's Journey stuff. &&The Japanese spirituality is very Ghibli-esque. *Princess Mononoke* and *Spirited Away* both largely deal with the Japanese traditional belief that aspects of nature have spirits and gods. And Kubo's ability to manipulate paper is much like the paper cutouts that attack the dragon in *Spirited Away*, which are actually shikigami, which, in Japanese folklore, are basically animated paper manipulated by sorcery.

Also, it just hit me in the feels like a Ghibli movie.&&A man that was evil (from their point of view)  his entire life.  Now, they told him that he was the best person ever, so he believed it.  Since he believed it, he would then go on being it.  It says that you can change your ways as long as you believe that you are a good person now&&The man couldnt remember what he had done, so they decided to tell him he's a good man, so that he can live a peaceful, happy life with his grandson instead of a hate filled bitter life as the moon king.

He was a blank slate, so they told him that by being kind and good, he can find happiness. They set him on a better path. &&To me the entire movie was in Kubo’s imagination and this kid has gone through some serious shit. His mother and father eloped without permission from the family. The father passed away and his mother grew sick with some sort of dementia and eventually passed away. His grandfather ended up taking him in but always spoke badly of his parents even though Kubo had loved them. Pile on the grandfather gets old and starts forgetting things. I just see a story of a boy who lost his parents and soon his grandfather.&&It's an interesting kind of revenge, to have the manipulation you used so liberally turned on you, but for the better.&&On a thematic, visual, and technical level I loved it. The plot? That kind of keeps it out of my toplists.&&Yeah, definitely not on the same level as the Academy Award-nominated *The Boss Baby*.  &&The story is somewhat lacking.&&Yeah, when I saw the trailer I thought I would love it...but I was really underwhelmed.  Beautiful, but it never really resonates on any level other than an aesthetic one.&&Yeah, I'm one of those people who really do appreciate the time and effort that goes into stop motion films, and especially one as visually stunning as this, but the story was severely lacking for me. I'd rate Coraline and the majority of the Studio Ghibli films quite far ahead of Kubo in terms of greatness.  &&""7/10 It's a masterpiece."" - r/movies&&Agree completely. I really *wanted* to love it because I love the art and brilliance that goes into the creation of something like Kubo. The visuals are incredible, but it was so lack luster in the story and character building department that I was really disappointed. &&Totally agree. Movie was a pretty big disappointment. It’s weird to see so much praise. &&Regina Spektor has a beautiful voice&&Oh man just thinking about that cover makes me tear up. I’m a big dude and I’m not ashamed to say I cried pretty hard during the credits. &&I love Regina so much. &&Yeah, a lot of people replying to me say they hated the ending...I thought it was great; not many family movies are brave enough to have an ending that isn't all rainbows and happiness. It also has a lot of roots in Japanese beliefs and spirituality. I think some people just weren't looking for symbolic, deeper meaning. Plus, the concept that even the worst among us could be altered into a better person by the words and deeds of others is a fantastic message to convey to kids.&&I was with you until you compared it to Howl's. Howl's is great but it's not even top 5 Ghibli&&I mean, Howl is really amazing, Kubo is excellent, but both don't feel like they have the fantastic charm of Spirited Away or the maturity of Princess Mononoke. Plus Toy Story had the smart Woody, the good dynamics and characters, the convincingly horrifying Syd.... I think people are just used to setting the bar absurdly absurdly high. Think ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" high. &&If u think it's great, it's ok. Because thats your opinion. For me, this us just an okay movie&&>Laika did deliver on this. 

As they have for a almost a decade. &&It’s certainly an achievement in stop motion animation &&Yeah, the making-of on the Blu-Ray said on their busiest days of production, they would shoot approximately *18 frames* of animation. Less than one second!&&Yep. The opening half hour is beautiful. We'll paced and draws you into the world. From there the story leaves a lot to be desired. Loses that sense of awe as soon as the journey begins in earnest. &&Girlfriend and I thought the same thing. Just a weird skip through a story that just kind of popped in ideas and then ignored them after a few minutes. Lackluster dryly executed dialogue. Even the great animation felt weirdly bland and generic in the design elements of it.&&I'm with you on this&&The overall story felt to me almost like a cheesy video game.  In order to face the bad guy you need to find x y z. It felt rushed.

Strangely, Coraline had exactly the same thing, which is what prevented me from enjoying it as well.&&I feel like much of the praise was from people who were caught up in the visuals and didn't see what it was built upon. Which was ""how do we have a bunch of cool set-pieces all in a single movie?""&&I love Coraline and ParaNorman, enjoyed Kubo, and wouldn't watch Boxtrolls a second time. Opinions!&&Based solely on visuals and animation, I'd put Kubo at the top of Laika's filmography. But yeah, the story does not meet that standards of what I expect from the studio. &&I couldn’t finish Kubo; turned it off halfway through. Matthew Mc... his character was too much. The other stars just didn’t need to be there; get voice actors instead of pumping Hollywood stars. There was also no understanding of the characters’ motivation. I hated the movie so much. &&[deleted]&&Yeah the ending was pretty awful, ""Gaslighting the elderly, The Movie""&&I think the voice acting was incredibly uninspired. The monkey especially was so bland. It was a beautiful looking film but I didn’t really care about anyone because of the voice work.&&It's beautiful to look at, but simultaneously pretty forgettable.

People wanted to root for an underdog (as in, not Disney or Pixar) and kept rooting for this for best animated picture because it happened to be extremely well animated, but didn't stop to consider that Zootopia and Moana were still better movies all around regardless.&&Nothing is the matter with you. We all have different tastes. I, too, didn't feel any connection with the movie. It was well-animated, yes, but the writing IMHO brought it down many notches below masterpiece-levels of greatness.

*Coraline* was better. *Spirited Away*--now that was a masterpiece; actually had to pause for a while after watching the film because I needed time to process all the emotions that movie left me.&&I fell asleep starting it twice. Once on a plane (despite having stayed up for Beauty and the Beast) and once on Netflix.

It made me want to watch Kung Fu Panda 2 again.&&The first part is slow but if you take it as the kids movie it is. it's a fun movie with a good character journey &&1. How old are you?
2. How’s your relationship with your parents?
3. Do you have a heart?&&I liked both and cried at both. I understand why the comparisons are being made, with the two main characters being similar, but I don't think that comparing the two is fair. They are very different films. Much like comparing apples and oranges, yes both are fruit, but there their similarities end.&&Nope, but I have a 2 year old, it is inevitable.&&It came out in 2016, was nominated, but lost to *Zootopia*.&&Gonna want a spicy source on this, since last I'd heard they were full on hand-sculpting smear frames for the crazier shit in Paranorman&&Those few seem to all be in this thread... &&Is this sarcasm? Because the whole rant, especially about ""ableism"", sounds like a parody.

Yes, Kubo's plot is classic. But classics are classics for a reason, because they appeal to the human experience and resonate with us. Growing up, saying goodbye to our parents, struggling to find a place in the world, all of these are things we all will have to deal with. The fantastical trappings do not weaken the sympathy we might feel for the characters.&&16’ tall , but your enthusiasm is greatly appreciated. Working on stop motion films of this caliber is a dream most artists could only hope for! Thank you!&&Yay!! I'm ready glad you mentioned this. I went when a few other people to check this out and it was just incredible. The rest of the museum was awesome as well, but it blew my fucking mind to see how big that skeleton actually was.

They added legs to it and the thing was like 2 stories tall.

And the garden from Coraline, the one shaped like her face, was the size of an entire room. Just MASSIVE.&&Its pretty great.  I uploaded some photos from there.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BbqP1qVF7bm/&&Was just there last weekend. Definitely worth the drive down from Seattle. Truly awesome&&Coraline was the movie that made me think 3D had a future and would be a popular standard in cinemas. Clearly that didn't become the case since no movie since utilized it so well. &&I think the movie I've seen that's most transformed by 3D is Gravity. And for the opposite of the usual reason. Instead of making the world grand and impressive, it makes the characters/setting small and insignificant, cold and desolate. &&Tron 2. I'd buy a 3d tv for it. &&I remember seeing the buttons fall from behind me in the opening and knowing this film was something special&&Don't know if it was marketed more elsewhere, but I had no idea it existed until a few months ago. Completely missed its theater run.&&I feel so bad when I pirate a movie that I liked so much.&&Are you ready for Isle of Dogs then?&&Same here. Great cussing movie &&The new Aardman movie Early Man is really good too.&&Thoroughly seconded. &&I feel like people on /r/movies might be familiar with Wes Anderson.&&It's on Netflix right now and well worth a watch.&&I was semi disappointed in the film because in my head, Neil Gaiman's version of Coraline was so much darker and creepier. My imagination painted so much more of a bleak and abysmal grey-themed story, whereas there were a lot more colors and laughs in the movie. Both are good overall though.&&Coraline is a book? For adults, or kids?&&Apparently, you need to see ‘Up’...  Never realized a montage could make a grown man cry and if I recall correctly it’s the same happy (4 note?) melody, but slowing it down drastically changes the mood.&&Not to say Circle of Life isn't a fantastic opening sequence, but I'm always saddened by the lack of love for The Little Mermaid's opening. I love the contrast of the dreary and gray surface world and the vibrant and colorful world under the sea. And the instrumental of Part of Your World that starts out so low key before swelling when you first see the merpeople and keeps building until you see Atlantica for the first time...

Be right back. Have to go rewatch the whole movie. And follow that up with Fantasia, which also has an amazing intro.&&But it's not animated, it's stop motion which makes out even better! Check it the behind the scenes, it's amazing.&&Or...or is it that he can never wink?&&It's been one of my most listened too on Spotify since I heard it.&&Same, it was so perfect. &&I fucking LOVE Regina spektor, ever since I heard the song ""the call"" at the end of the second Narnia movie. 

Here it is. https://youtu.be/WuB9Dt21jJU&&You nailed it.&&I pray you're right!&&Yeah, Laika studios and Nike HQ are basically right next to eachother.&&If I was a wealthy man. I would open up an animation studio and throw money at it even at a loss. Phil Knight sounds like a hero to me.&&My old theatre manager used to say ""I feel like Laika's movies are just projects for fun that make just enough money for the next one."" I couldn't argue with him. &&[deleted]&&Well, if I understand correctly, and I've heard this time and time again, a movie has to make at least double its budget to break even since only about half of its box office goes to the studio (even less in overseas markets). The only Laika movie that has managed to do that is their first film, 2009's Coraline.&&I'm pretty sure they closed down recently. The head decided to go direct ""real movies"" (apparently the Transformers spin off) and took his money with him and put the company on hold. A few of my friends and a hundreds of others are out of work. Guy's a dick.&&The worst part about is that a lot of the people saw the Emoji Movie because it was so outlandish and bad. I hate that people would rather spend their money on a movie they know is terrible just for a stupid joke but won't go out and support movies like Kubo.&&Please tell me that's not true. That's not true right? You made that up?

... I know it's true. I wish I didn't know this fact. If only I could turn time back 30 seconds.&&I totally agree. Kubo was absolutely gorgeous from a visual standpoint but the narrative was really disjointed (IMO). I can’t remember the last time a villain was introduced like 20 minutes before the movie ended...&&Strongly agree. The animation was Laika at their strongest and most imaginative, simply the most gorgeous movie they have ever created. But the story was so underdeveloped that it almost seemed to be an afterthought. I was deeply disappointed.&&I viewed it more as the villagers making the old man better for *his* sake, not for theirs. He was a blank slate now; what are they going to do, rip his shirt, spit at him, and kick him out of town? They decided to take the high road and give him a happy human life rather than dwell on a past he had as a god that he doesn't even remember. Maybe Kubo could have a grandfather after all, that way.

Plus, if he acts up, they could always just communally murder him.&&I thought the idea was more that instead of meeting hate with hate which would've made the old man back into a horrible person they met him with kindness and he became a good person.&&Oh! I found this one of the most beautiful parts of the movie. It's been a year since I saw it but I remember crying ugly tears at the ending. The old man genuinely couldn't remember his past and the villagers chose to keep him ignorant of his wrongdoing. 
The whole movie had some really dark events that would be classed as horror if not animated so beautifully. &&They just finished, actually.&&The sword, his father. The shield, his mother. The helmet, himself. Three legendary items, each correlating to a member of his family. [His dad fought the Moon King, his mother protected him from the Moon King, and in the end he gained the wisdom he had gained to finally defeat the Moon King. All three pieces of his family were needed.](#spoiler)&&I know I'm nitpicking but I don't think that's a ""theme"" of the movie (nor is it technically a theme at all). A theme in Kubo would be ""learning through loss"" or ""love conquers all."" Kubo finding his family is simply part of the plot. 

other popular themes would be good v evil, coming-of-age, underdog, man vs nature&&I understand that, but IMO it made for a pretty underwhelming climax. I was expecting a bigger an more epic battle at the end, especially with the whole movie building up how powerful and fearsome the Moon King was. &&Whaaaaa?! The ending was the best. I was emotionally traumatized for days. Who are you people and what happened to you love of a story ending that stuck it to you?&&the third act runs out of steam&&Definitely felt like they were getting impatient and just rushed it a bit.&&I thought the ending was a lot worse than mediocre. It didn't ruin the movie for me by any means but it certainly detracted from my enjoyment of it.&&As much as I'd cottoned on to a majority of it relatively quickly, I was just overjoyed with the final ""revelation""  of the two strings. 

For whatever reason I didn't see it coming and it was so extremely *nice*&&Agreed, I liked Charlize Theron's srs bsns approach. It sounded to me like she was burdened by knowing the stakes of everything.&&The sisters are the best sub villain I think I've ever seen. The way they float and sound and look. They creep me out so badly. &&[deleted]&&Maybe you’ve forgotten the plot because it was pretty unconventional? Most Pixar plots are pretty formulaic, but executed well.  By coincidence I saw this film just today, and realised I’d not seen a plot like it before.&&Agreed. Kubo was mediocre. The animation was astounding though! Too bad the story didn't support it. 

I *loved* Boxtrolls though. Voice acting and story were way better than Kubo. 

Ninja edit: Not all Pixar is great. Brave, The Good Dinosaur, Cars series (like you named)&&I can't remember any of the stories of the Pixar movies, except for Finding Nemo. But I don't think it's fair to call them forgettable...&&Actually, they spend years working on the script before they do any of the animation. I think in the behind the scenes stuff on Kubo they said it took 5 years to make the movie, only 2 of which were actually making it. With stop motion animation, you don't really get many chances to do retakes, because all of the facial expressions/mouths for talking are 3D printed, which takes a long ass time. &&Exactly, it wasn't a bad ending for like kids and stuff but the final act definitely seemed like they changed it from what it was originally or something weird, it didn't fit with the rest of the movie. I loved it for the most part and the soundtrack was stellar, would wathc again but def not their BEST&&For me, I really didn't like the ending. It just seemed wrong to me to have Kubo ""forgive"" the character who had essentially killed/took his mother and father away from him, harmed him physically, and just generally was a pretty abusive person. The aunts were also not given the same opportunity for forgiveness.... the ending really didn't sit right for me.&&I like Kubo but I agree, it feels very different from Ghibli films. Ghibli is more quiet family moments and atmospheric exploration of a world. Usually very charming--Kubo had an oriental setting but it was a very modern film focusing on family dynamic and loss. Beautifully animated but more in an adventure sense, not ""warm home feel"" like Ghibli.&&If anything one of my biggest criticisms of the movie is the massive drawing of asian culture tropes while at the same time having a major western bias in the production choices of the film. For example, with magical shamisen powers being a major driver of the film, why would you make all the dramatic moments suddenly be electric guitar? Why are all the major characters voiced by white people with big asian actors making cameos for insignificant characters? All in all it's these things that make the movie annoying to me, even though I will agree, it should set the bar for stop motion animation for years to come.&&There’s a phenomenal Laika exhibition at the Portland Art Museum right now. It explains that some of the background for Kubo came from the samurai exhibit at the museum in Portland since the company is based in Oregon. It also showed how they used traditional paper folding and origami methods to convey most parts of the movie, from the clothing to the hair to the water even. The idea for the water came from manipulating paper. Each of their movies has a very distinct artistic style that is kept throughout and the scenery is absolutely incredible to see in person, the school hallways in Paranorman were crazy detailed. There was also a film about how they make all of the accessories in their movies and just one glass lamp from a movie takes an insane amount of man hours. This company is truly making works of art not just Hollywood 15-minutes hits and I so hope that they are successful.&&I'll give you the shikigami likeness, which itself has nothing to do with Ghibli, but it bears no resemblance to a Ghibli film outside of that. Kubo doesn't even flirt with heavy issues, I don't think it respects children as feeling thinking beings where that seems to be the entire ethos behind Ghibli. It's a video game story much more in line with Coraline than Spirited Away. Literally a non-interactive collect-a-thon. If it was a novel I wouldn't have read it because it would go in the kid's section, and if it was a video game I'd be bored, and as a movie I only checked it out because people kept saying it was in the spirit of Ghibli films.

Tone, no. Story, no. Visuals, no. Characters, no. It never takes a risk. It never makes the audience feel anything, unless you go in for the 'emotional setup scene' and later 'emotional payoff scene' which are as rote as every other element. There is no auteur-like presence hanging over this, the only thing is the visual style which I guess is called Laika now? I didn't find it distinctive enough to be named after the production company but it is very pretty, which Ghibli films also are, which I think is where the comparison comes from. 

What it is is a good visual resume. I want to see what they'll do next but I really hope it involves adapting an existing story rather than writing their own because they don't write their own, they use a template. Perhaps we remember Ghibli films differently because this was like they went through Ghibli's trademarks with a fine-toothed comb and whenever something too distinctive came up they cut it to end up with this... Animated motion picture that occupied 90 minutes of some night in my past.&&Ok, that actually sounds nice. I would've preferred if it was somehow shown another way, but I loved the movie nonetheless. &&For me, it was how they tried to blend storytelling tropes from the East and character type tropes from the West. It felt awkward. &&I don't think you understand. You see, he's a *boss* but he's also a *baby*! I wonder if he'll learn to put family ahead of business by the end of the movie...&&Wait...&&Wait...&&shit like this gets nominated over ""A Silent Voice""&&Wait...&&Where's the lie? &&TBH I love Boss Baby&&[deleted]&&The story is honestly mind-numbing boring. The movie has an amazing animation and atmosphere with cool action, and whole moon family thing was an interesting setting, but it failed in execution and storytelling. The result is kinda bland, with ""plot twists"" you see coming miles away, such as the identity of the bug warrior or the monkey. &&Story is very mediocre. Can’t even remember what happened in this movie. &&Somewhat lacking is generous as well, the story is pretty flimsy and the characters/worldbuilding leave a lot to be desired.&&>Behold, the Thunder of Laputa!&&I rate both Coraline and Paranorman ahead of Kubo. I liked the epic scale of Kubo but it didn't feel like it payed off enough. Paranorman went the opposite way, exceeding my expectations. I'm even tempted to rank Paranorman ahead of Coraline, even if it's a little more formulaic and less daring.&&The issue with the ending was not that it wasnt happy it but that it was rushed. The villains were not really explored at all and since the ending hinged on them the resolution fell flat.&&>some people just weren't looking for symbolic, deeper meaning

The ending was extremely two-dimensional, any ""deeper meaning"" was thrust directly into the face of the audience for the sake of children understanding it. I'm not going to try to take away your enjoyment of the movie, but pretending that it's a remarkable movie and that people who say otherwise just don't understand it is ridiculous.&&I'll admit, I've only seen the beginning, ending, and bits of the middle, as the movie hit WAY too close to home for me, and I had to step away from it a few times to keep from sobbing in a room full of people. But what I gathered from it:

The movie is very clearly about dementia (probably Alzheimer's, but my own mother has another form of dementia that has similar signs so it could just be a generalization) and Kubo's struggle to cope with it. He doesn't know his father, he's losing his mother (she occasionally has breakthroughs but those moments are getting rarer), and all he ""knows"" about his grandfather is that he's mean and disapproves of Kubo's parents. Now Kubo's mother is nearing death and he's likely to be placed in the care of this strange man Kubo's built up to be this terrible person based on stories he's been told. He doesn't want to live with him, so he fights against it as hard as he can. (And Kubo's imagination grows more rampant the harder he struggles to cope.) I can't remember exactly how the boss fight went down (it was a while ago), but by the end it became apparent that Kubo's grandfather also has dementia, and as the village starts showing Kubo what a great person his grandfather really is, Kubo finally begins to accept round two of caring for a sick elder.

In the past, I've heard people claim the village was ""lying"" to the grandfather to make him turn good, but as someone struggling with the dementia caretaker position at this very moment, the ""wild-imagination-to-cope"" aspect is spot on. It's a beautiful film and I really hope I'll be able to watch it without having a breakdown someday.&&Haha I hesitated to write that because I knew I was gunna get shit for it &&Yeah. If only somebody would make an Avatar: The last Airbender movie. I bet it would be awesome!&&That... Can't be right. Unless they are just talking about one particular scene, like the boat fight or the skeleton scene. 

Something like the final battle where they used smaller puppets was surely faster than that. &&I remember commenting to my husband while we were watching it how much it felt like a video game. &&[deleted]&&or they just liked it better? I love Zootopia and Kubo. Moana felt pretty meh. It's just individual taste.&&Yeah, maybe this movie struck me because I'm a relatively new parent, and a central theme of the whole movie is the power of the parental bond. I understand Kubo's mother's actions, sacrificing everything she knew in the name of protecting her child.&&i hate to be the guy who recommends, but

have you seen song of the sea? its like if miyazaki consumed only jameson whiskey, lived in Kilkenny, Ireland, and only used watercolor.

also you will cry. &&As with any endeavor worth pursuing, it requires people willing to invest the requisite effort. You just don't see that in many places, regardless of the endeavor. &&I''d argue 3d is the only way to enjoy Avatar, and Gravity was insane in 3d, but yeah the fact that I can't really think of any others proves your point haha.&&Avatar, Cave Of Forgotten Dreams, Gravity, Hugo, Life of Pi were all great films to watch in 3D.

I'm still not exactly sad the 3D fad has died though.&&Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi are my favorite 3D films. Life of Pi really made great use of it. That scene in the beginning when the ship sank and he's underwater was breathtaking in 3D.&&Similarly, watching it in a drive in theater with nothing but the night sky framing the screen was incredible. &&Can’t agree more, I saw it when it was re-released  at my local imax for science week and it was stunning. It’s the only 3D movie to ever make me flinch from the stuff flying on screen. It was mesmerizing &&Avatar in IMAX 3D was insane. I can't stand watching it at home.&&Step Up 3D. That’s where it’s at!&&I mean, you could just.. buy it? &&I had to do that for The Shape of Water because the closest showing was over 300 miles away&&I'm really stoked for that one!&&HOW LONG MUST I WAIT&&I actually just saw this a few hours ago. I liked it, it’s quite good (and I say this not generally being a Wes Anderson fan).

Soundtrack was 🔥, same with Black Panther soundtrack (helmed by Kendrick Lamar, which I don’t listen to either).&&I loved Pirates! So I'm looking forward to seeing Early Man. &&Will have a looksie, thanks.&&Because the book could make the reader imagine the story to be darker than what is written so it could still be passed off as a children's book while the movie has to actually show it so they can't just make a dark, grim wasteland. They instead show a dark, grim wasteland with some color thrown in. &&Gaiman just has a gift for creepy, suspenseful prose.  I think the Coraline film did a solid job of translating most of that, but reading it was definitely more affecting.

I'm still upset that Henry Selick (director of Coraline, and animation director of The Nighmare Before Christmas) wasn't allowed to direct a film adaptation of Gaiman's 'The Graveyard Book'.

The opening lines of The Graveyard Book:

*There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife.*

*The knife had a handle of polished black bone, and a blade finer and sharper than any razor. If it sliced you, you might not even know you had been cut, not immediately.*

*The knife had done almost everything it was brought to that house to do, and both the blade and the handle were wet.*&&The graphic novel is a much darker version of the story than the film - probably more what you're after.&&I like how they played with colour in the movie. In the real world, everything is grey but the characters are colourful. And then in the other world, everything is bright and bold... Except for the characters, that look washed up.



It shows how Coraline was bored in the real world but was surrounded by colourful, bright people. The other world is more interesting to her, but the people there are just bad copies of the ones in the real world&&I returned Coraline to the library without finishing it when I was a kid because it scared me so much. Same with Philip Pullman's Clockwork.&&God I don't even remember how I envisioned the story, but I do remember lots of dark, grey, and brown at times.&&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline

YA I beleive, but can be read and enjoyed by any ages.&&The opening to ""up"" could be a short movie in it's own right. It's above and beyond the quality of most storytelling.

Heck, those ten minutes outshine the rest of the movie by far, which in and of itself is almost definitely deliberate. Much like the old timer's view on his own life - the best bits are all at the start, and then (comparatively,) things just drag from there. The movie just isn't the same without Ellie from that point on.

It's.... beautiful.&&>(4 note?) 

While Michael Giacchino uses a decent number of notes for the main theme or tag, you're right in that the first 4 notes he uses in the melody (roughly sounding like: -- ^ -- _ ) are definitely the most recognizable to people.

He's essentially one of the only modern film score composers that stylistically follows what the ""old guard"" considered as standard back then (Alan Silvestry: ""Back to the Future"", James Horner: ""Titanic"", John Williams:......everything (Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, etc)). I think that's why Pixar's been using him as their go-to composer instead of Thomas Newman (who I absolutely love). He makes more ""hummable"" tunes (which I personally don't think makes better film music, but I'm sure their marketing department would adamantly disagree with me).&&I wonder how much marriages the first ten minutes of that movie saved?&&Strong men also cry... Strong. Men. Also. Cry.&&My now 14-yr.old son still loves loves “Up.”  It’s something we can still watch together and we both cry because the old man’s wife reminds us so much of Grandma (my mom). Then we cry at the end because... well... life goes on, doesn’t it? Grandpa just passed also.&&I think I remember not watching animated movies for years because I thought they were just for kids. Then so many people were talking about Up that I decided to watch it. Animated movies are definitely made for adults as much as they're made for kids. That intro convinced me that I was probably missing out on a whole lot of good movies, so I ended up watching all the best animated movies from over the years. Excited as fuck for The Incredibles 2&&I hate you. I've just opened that opening on youtube to remind me of music, saw like 5 seconds in the beginning, clicked for five seconds to the middle, clicked for five seconds somewhere near the end (bed scene) and cried. This scene is so powerful, that it took 15 seconds long reminder to make me cry. Best piece of film making, that I ever saw.

EDIT: only 2 instant-emotion openings that come to mind are opening of MI4 and opening of Star Trek. (both are obviously much weaker than up).&&Anyone who got to the theater late saw a COMPLETELY different movie.&&That was such an emotional scene scene, however Finding Nemo's intro rips my heart out and tears it into shreds like few other things can.&&What I found truly remarkable about up was the way in then first ten minutes they split that out between adults and kids. Kids watched it and didn’t really get what was going on but they were invested enough to stay interested.  Adults on the other hand.  Wow. When you realise she has lost the baby.  Shiiiiiiiit that fucked me up bad. Kids however.  Totally oblivious. Wouldn’t have a clue.  Incredible story telling. &&I mean stop motion is really cool but it's also a form of animation.&&Or is he always winking?&&Did u know of George Harrison and his other works before this movie?&&It's cool when hella rich people do cool things with their money... instead of the typical, how do I make more fuckin' money with my piles of money shit they love to do.&&Kind of reminds me of the old patronage system, where a nobleman would commission work from a fine artist. What beauty you could reach for if you didn't always have to watch your bottom line!&&Their movies have a bit of 3D animation to supplement the stop motion.&&they have been making commercials for a long time&&Kubo was terribly advertised. The only reason I knew about it was because I happened to walk by a movie theater the week it opened and saw a poster for it. I knew nothing about the movie and only saw it because it's stop motion and I love stop motion movies. The emoji movie was relentlessly advertised for months.&&I love watching bad movies, but The Emoji Movie wouldn't be a fun bad movie to watch.&&""Hey, does this milk smell bad to you?""

fornicate this homosexual earth&&Well, to be fair they totally mention the villain in the opening scenes by establishing where kubo's eye is.&&Came here to agree with the dissenters.  I am a huge stop motion and almost anything animated fan.  Movie was well done visually, but the story and characters were most definitely NOT to my taste.&&My first thought after seeing the movie was that it felt like a trilogy jammed into a single movie. Far too much going on to make for good character development—had they made a trilogy out of it, it might have been a *proper* masterpiece.&&The greater good&&Exactly.

2) I'd like to challenge your claim and say that the sword was the mother, the armor was the father, and will agree on the helmet that it was him. His mother may have protected him, but she always did so through combat, whether it be by magic or sword. She wielded the sword most expertly throughout the film. On the point of the father, it can be argued that he was always willing to give his life for Kubo, even when he didn't know him. Even early in the movie, Kubo's robes, which bore the mark of his father's clan were what allowed him to flee. Furthermore, during the boat fight, Hanzo was with him to protect him, during which time his mother fought above the waves. It was the only moment with just the two of them and happened to be exactly when he found the armor impenetrable, symbolizing his father's love. &&Motif?&&One of my favorite moments from *Stranger Things* S2 (...spoiler? not a plot point, just fun dialogue):

> **Dustin:** It's the best metaphor we have for what's going on!

> **Lucas:** Analogy.

> **Dustin:** ...*that's* what you're worried about right now?&&It's not only a theme or narrative hinted at, but the whole plot&&> I was expecting a bigger an more epic battle at the end

I assumed that was intentional. Kubo spends most of the film running around after [MacGuffins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) to become more powerful, but the ending subverts it all to show that seeking power and using violence is actually a flawed and narrow worldview.

Of course, the film tries to have its cake and eat it too by throwing in lots of straight action sequences before that, but meh, they were entertaining.&&I very much think that was the point, though. It used typical story tropes and learned movie devices to lead the audience to certain expectations, only to have those expectations undercut in the end, providing the climax with greater impact. I would have been honestly disappointed if the ending has just been him with a straight-forward victory over the Moon King&&I was pretty in love with the concept of ""Hey, we don't have to kill the bad guy"" that it was kinda leading up to and strayed away from. Felt a bit more fresh in that regard. Also was pretty awesome in watching it with my wee ones saying ""Look at that, they turned him around"".&&I think the ending was one of the biggest takeaways for me. It was something that I haven't seen before and made me put myself in Kubo's shoes and wonder what it would be like.&&My issue with the ending is that they didn’t *really* convert him. They just lied to him, and now he’s a ticking time bomb for when he eventually finds out the truth. I thought for sure the ending was going to be that because he was using one of Kubo’s eyes and had come down to earth, he was vulnerable to the same emotions that had captured Kubo’s mother. But the stolen eye turned out to be an anti-Chekhov’s Gun, never actually being used for anything. &&I didn't like how the bad guy was just told he had never done horrible things and they just lied to him about being a great person. It felt wrong and weird, and kind of tacked on or something.&&IMO, the ending was heart-wrenching but the final battle and climax left much to be desired.&&>  I was emotionally traumatized for days. 

That sounds like something.. special with you, rather than the movie. &&I agree. It felt incomplete. Still a good film though &&Nailed it. Exactly how I felt after watching it. But to me it felt like a deadline crunch. &&Yeah I think everyone in this thread is getting a little high on their horse for ""figuring it out."" The twists were not incredibly complicated by any stretch but if you can suspend your disbelief it's not as if they just slap you across the face with any of it. I liked the story since it was really only tryibg to feel like a fairy tale.&&Yeah, I think it also provided a nice contrast to [Kubo's absent-minded mother, which helps obfuscate the twist.](#spoiler)&&It also gave off a fun Wes Anderson vibe&&It was definitely an intentional choice from a voice direction point of view. Her character's whole thing was that she was the deadpan snark and business to Beetle's goofball comic relief.

She suppressed all her emotions, he wore his on his sleeve.&&Oh no, don't cry. Sorry. It's just a reminder that the one thing we don't get more of is time. Use it.&&See, I remember Kubo vividly and I loved every minute of it. I've completely forgotten about Boxtrolls, and I don't remember being that captivated by it to begin with. It's so interesting that people have such polarized opinions.&&> I loved Boxtrolls though. Voice acting and story were way better than Kubo.

I did too! I really can't understand why it was rated the lowest out of all the Laika movies. It was by far my favourite and I think the best of theirs.&&I didn't understand why Eggs spoke perfect English in Boxtrolls when he was raised by them.  &&That was a really excellent way to describe what I have been having trouble putting into words. The second act relied way too much on Western character interactions (slapstick humor), it just felt so out of place and in contrast to the first act. The whole theme of the ending felt like something taken out of a Studio Ghibli film but executed in an American cinematic way with too much emphasis on grandeur and platitudes and not enough depth and subtlety. Just didn't seem to work well.&&Also, it would have been a great opportunity to take a chance on casting an Asian voice actor for one of the lead roles.&&The trailers for Boss Baby made me dislike it immediately,  but my kids turned it on on Netflix,  and I still love it even on the 50th rewatch. The art style is fantastic and the whole thing is just done really well. &&I know you didn’t mean to triple post, but that was my reaction when I heard it was nominated as well.&&""Can't we just share?""

""You didn't go to business school, did you.""

Boss Baby was great. Sue me. &&I wasn’t expecting to but I really liked it too. It had good heart, was funny, and the voice acting was great. The animation quality is also really high. I secretly enjoyed it a lot more than Kubo, even though Kubo’s visuals are obscenely beautiful (and painstakingly hand crafted!).&&Remarkably animated but pretty flat on the writing side of it for me.

&&Mark Hamill killed the shit out of that role. He's such a dynamic and emotive voice actor. His performance adds a depth, an extra layer of meaning, to Muska, who is a pretty shallow villian as written.

Castle in the Sky is my favorite Ghibli movie (one of my favorite films of all time, even) and the strength of the voice cast is one of the biggest reasons. Hamill's Muska and Cloris Leachman as Dola are (to me, anyway) iconic voice performances.  
&&I love Miyazaki’s films but I can’t watch that film for the sole reason my mind automatically replaces “Laputa” with “cunt.” It’s more tragic than it sounds. &&honestly the dub for that movie is one of the only dubs I approve of. but that's probably because they vastly improved the soundtrack as well.&&[deleted]&&And it relied too much on empty platitudes, such as the [power of love](#spoiler), that weren't really explored too much throughout the rest of the film. Felt like a cheap way to end the movie.&&I am seriously sick of the ""people that have criticisms just didn't get it"" thought process.&&> I'm not going to try to take away your enjoyment of the movie, but pretending that it's a remarkable movie and that people who say otherwise just don't understand it is ridiculous.

Perfectly stated. Well done friendo.&&I like Howls the most too man, dont get down on yourself&&Howl's is my favorite Ghibli too, but I accept it isn't the best of them. I feel the same about Life Aquatic and Wes Anderson. &&I think it's similar to Howl's in that it's an absolute gorgeous labor of love that is somewhat let down by a rushed and unsatisfying ending. That being said, I still own both!&&Honestly I agree with you Howl's is one of my favorite animated movies&&It [was for the skeleton scene:](http://www.thisisinsider.com/kubo-and-the-two-strings-skeleton-2016-11)

>said animator Charles Greenfield[,] ""A slow day would be eight frames a day in 12 hours ... A fast day? 18 frames.""&&Also even if the movie were only 1 hour long, this would mean they were in production for 10 years including weekends.&&I feel very alone in that I absolutely despised the chicken from Moana. People were laughing at it and a lot of folk say it's funny, but I was so damn unnecessary.&&You had me at Miyazaki and Jameson whiskey.&&I think its simply because most movies its tacked onto dont have need for it besides ""wow"" factor and pop outs. 

In coraline it was used as something to give depth and realism to the movie. Not to mention it had a major role in the storytelling. Perfect use of the tech imho&&You hit the nail on the head. Good 3D is expensive and requires meticulous planning.

To really do 3D right, you've gotta shoot it with two cameras and plan every shot exhaustively because you have very little control over the depth once it's shot. But movies today require changes up to the last second.

So the majority of 3D that makes it to the big screen is achieved by handing the 2D shots off to teams of rotoscopers who go through frame by frame and cut out every single element in the image, offset them to create the second eye, and then paint in all the gaps behind all the layers they just shifted and exposed. And because it's all done to what ""seems right"" to the artists moving the layers, it actually doesn't have a foundation in real geometry anymore as it would have in the camera. So the depth never *quite* works. It's a miserable process, it's the worst thing I could possibly imagine having to do in the industry, and it's not *really* that much cheaper than doing it the right way. 

But it's a hell of a lot easier for the moneymakers, because it pushes all the 3D fine-tuning and decision making to the end of the line, instead of the beginning.&&Avatar was shot properly with two cameras, and Gravity was made with a hybrid approach where they basically did a 3D scan of the environment and used that to build the stereo effect from the footage.

Most movies just throw tons and tons of bodies at the task of cutting out elements and moving them more or less by hand to create the depth effect, which always looks fake and a little painful to watch. &&Life of Pi rounds out my top 3 with Avatar and Gravity. &&How to Train Your Dragon really benefited from it as well.&&Life of Pi was amazing in 3D. It's probably the one movie along with Avatar that I've seen (never seen Coraline) that I consider executed the 3D flawlessly.&&Pacific Rim&&Tron: Legacy did some neat things with 3d like making the real world 2d and the computer world 3d so that you get this Wizard of Oz black and white to colour effect.&&Couldn’t agree more about Life of Pi. I have a 3D TV and Life of Pi on 3D bluray is mesmerizing. The scene where it shows the flashback of Pi’s mom reading to him about Krishna is breathtaking. As the book opens and the camera zooms into Krishna’s mouth, we go through and into the universe. Such a great effect.&&Yeah, watching that scene at home made me wish I’d seen it in 3D.&&Yep, IMAX Avatar is absolutely the bar for 3D.  It was so immersive that when the ash started raining down when the tree was burning down, I was trying to swat it out of the way.&&That's because you're not distracted by the amazing visuals, so you have to focus on the story instead.&&PSA for everyone who doesn't know. PlayStation VR got an update that made it compatible with 3D blu ray. If you own a PSVR, throw a 3D movie in your PS4 and put your helmet on. It's the closest I've seen to see an IMAX 3D movie at home.&&Sure, in 6 or 8 months, but if I was OP it's what I would do too. Pirate the movie now, and then buy a copy on release to support the movie.&&I just finished The Graveyard Book audiobook recently, Gaiman's voice as the narrator was so good, so was the book, I may have cried at the end. 

If someone would make a movie adaptation, it should definitely be that guy. &&Had no idea Neil Gaiman was behind this phenomenon. Just finished American Gods a few weeks ago. Thanks for the link!&&*(Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker)*

My wife and I have been together for almost 20 years, since we were teenagers. Every couple of years, when we've reached a new turning point in our relationship - studying abroad, moving in together, getting married, having children, buying a house - we say ""Here comes our adventure's next part"". 

It's like an emotional tradition with a decidedly melancholic undertone, because we know that one day we'll say these words when our kids move out. Or get married. Or have children. Or when we grow old, and one of us gets sick. 

And one day, one of us will say ""Here comes my adventure's final part, now it's up to you.""

&&Wow. I've watched ""Up"" a dozen times and I never looked at it like that. &&The opening to Up is fantastic. The rest of the movie doesn't do much for me, but that opening is amazing.&&The first ten minutes are heart warming and breaking.  They do a masterful job of portraying the ups and downs of a lifetime in minutes.  I tear up every time I see it.  The rest of the movie, is pretty damn good in my opinion, the introduction of Doug especially.  Towards the end  I thought the did a wonderful job expressing the sense of high adventure.  

There are only a few animated movies that i would consider masterpieces, UP, Tubo and the two strings, The Incredibles, the ending of Kung fu Panda 3 in the spirit world, Monsters, Inc, just to name a few.&&I was babysitting a couple years ago and up was on. By the end of the 10 mins, I had my hood up and I was crying a river.&&They're called leimotifs.

I just really like this version.&&Well, Laika's films don't *lose* money.&&Not only that, but theyre employing dozens of people who have the same passions. Not only are they using their money to follow their own dreams, but theyre funding the dreams of others, and giving us art on the way. &&Yeah some of the things you just can't do easily or at all in stop-motion, especially lighting effects.&&Commercials were always running for it where I am. I remember seeing an ad for it a couple months before it came out with the scene with the mom on the raft and While My Guitar Gently Weeps playing over it and I was freaking spellbound.&&Kids just like to watch dumb shit&&If you think about it in terms of the lowest common denominator (which isn't referring to people being stupid, but just appealing to the largest group of people), then it's no surprise at all that the Emojii movie made more money. It appealed to millions of kids ages 3-9 and all of their parents had to go with them, as well as a bunch of young adults who went to see it for the meme. Kubo is probably too dark for like 3-6ish crowd, and kids wouldn't have been drawn to the subject matter as quickly or easily compared to the Emojii movie. A kid could half pay attention to a Kubo trailer and not really know what they just saw, but they see a poop emojii on TV and their parents' wallets didn't stand a chance.&&[deleted]&&STOP SAYING THAT&&Yeah. An eye for an eye was the whole reason they were fighting in the guy in the first place!&&You're right, it was armor. I was reading someone else's reply that said shield and stupidly assumed they were right.

And that interpretation is certainly valid. There are even more pieces of evidence to point towards that given Hanzo's form through most of the film. I will say that either point could be valid because Kubo's mother didn't defend him by fighting while they were hiding, and when the film begins Hanzo is presumed dead by battle, and his mother takes a good beating on some rocks to save Kubo. They both do a decent amount of fighting and protecting in the movie, but based on what attributes they have during the film I can certainly agree with his mother being the sword and father the armor.&&No, thank you.&&The ending was the best part for me as well. It sent me on a journey to better myself, to change my story. Beautiful ending and it was snubbed at the awards show because it was the best animated film of 2016.&&Yeah that was my problem too. Also, now the whole village and his grandson have to live a lie with this old man, never telling the truth. This old man who was the death of both his parents...&&The good 'ol Darth Revan treatment.  What could go wrong!&&There really should have been another long musical sequence like the paper dolls at the very start.

It's just rough wondering what it could have been.&&Yeah I watched it semi-ironically until I realized it's actually really fun and has a genuine heart as you say. I don't get the hate.&&In general I would say that is Laika's biggest problem. They need to get better writers.&&Really lackluster humor, too. Often crass and fails to land. &&I guess it’s time for me to track down the dub. Laputa and Nausicaa are my favorite Miyazaki films&&Holy crap! I had idea that was Mark Hamill!

Wishing you both many more adventures together! &&[deleted]&&The whole movie is a story about finding purpose in the present, and not just the past. It's a deliberately outlandish adventure disguised in the trappings of early adventure serials (the same things that inspired Indiana Jones). The emotional climax isn't beating the bad guy, it's Carl letting the house and chairs go.

The first 10 minutes is the saddest part, yes. But him literally throwing the trappings of his old life out the window to take up a new adventure is the most POWERFUL part.

If you look at the behind the scenes videos for Kubo and the Two Strings, the immediate scenery is actually on the set, but a lot of the stuff in the distance is green screen. They have track lighting for pretty much everything else. As far as ""impossible to do in true stop motion"", the water in the movie is 3D animation, but they sat around and studied water and water animation and all that jazz to make it *look* like stop motion animated water. 
&&Or the ocean at the start of Kubo.&&And you know there were thousands of people that knew it was a shit movie but are ok with watching something entirely flat and benign to just ""shut out their brains"" or, worse, watch it ""ironically"" for memes. &&My kids saw Kubo when they were 6 and 7 (I was with them) . Yeah they found it scary but also though Moanna was scary. &&Yup, its why you rarely see original movies on theaters, ESPECIALLY original animated movies.  Its a lot safer to just use something that everyone knows about (in this case, emojis) because they already know and correctly predicted that kids would eat that up.  Meanwhile, Kubo is completely new and none of the characters or cast are familiar with moviegoers, and new things scare kids!

Its a sad fact when it comes to movies, but thats generally why 95% of the stuff you'll see is either a sequel, adaptation or remake of an existing media.&&~~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(narrative)~~

What if life was in 3d"" after walking out of the theater.&&Still my favorite movie theater experience. I liked Avatar more than most, but it isn't my favorite movie. Whenever my friends bash it, I always ask them ""did you see it originally in 3d?"" Most hadn't. It was such an immersive experience that the story line could have been much worse and it still would have been breathtaking. &&> an emotional tradition with a decidedly melancholic undertone

Damn I rolled a 3&&Damn Ninjas&&Dats how u no dis ain't there first language.&&My wife was a little upset that I didn't cry at our wedding. I have to remind her of my emotions during that day because I'm not about showing them. 

I only remember bits and pieces of the day, tbh. I remember being a nervous wreck. I remember fumbling with my kilt and all the pieces of the rest of the suit. I remember waiting at the alter for what felt like hours (she was a little late due to her hair not cooperating which I found out later) battling the intrusive thoughts of her not wanting to go through with it. I remember feeling elated when she finally did show up and walked to the alter beside her father and him having to jump over her train to get to his spot. I remember my hands shaking and dropping the ring and the ensuing hunt for it. I remember the music messing up as we went to start our lives together and playing William tell overture finale. I remember suggesting we run the hell out of there and go home and her telling me we've got to do the reception so we can't. I remember her and everyone else playfully threatening to stab me if I pushed  cake into her face. I remember going back to her mother's house for a drink and a dance. I remember counting the 100 Bobby pins out of her hair. I remember falling unconscious in our bed for the first time and the smell of her as she curled up into me while I did.

And then she dies.&&you've somehow managed to make it sadder, yeesh.&&Most Pixar movies start with a good status quo: Carl's life in Up, Woody being the fave in Toy Story, McQueen being the best in Cars. None of these characters start from being locked in a dungeon or stuck in a tower. They have a purpose they enjoy.  Then, it all comes crashing down.

You might say that all Pixar movies have satisfying openings and UNsatisfying second acts... But that's kind of the point. They're about change, and embracing newness even when the ""old"" felt perfect. &&The best model work has always involved compositing models together.

It was, by far, the best film I had seen that week. So much heart-warming joy.

Maybe some marmalade sandwiches would've helped!

I always imagined a sequel to turn out shit like in most cases.  So happy Paddington seems to be an exception!&&Very well deserved. Took my daughter to see it recently and was blown away but how wonderful it all was. 

Funny, warm and fun. I'm really happy that such a pure and empathetic character like Paddington is proving to be so popular with kids. &&I loved the first movie. The 2nd is more of the same and it's amazing. Don't just think it's a kids movie. It's really enjoyable. &&[deleted]&&Well deserved at that. It's as perfect as a family movie could be. &&RT doesn’t work the way a lot of people think it does, so I’ll remind y’all. Remember, 100% doesn’t mean that the general consensus is this is the best movie in existence, 100% means that 100% of critics/audience members gave positive reviews about the movies. I’m not saying Paddinton 2 is crap, I’m saying don’t go in with expectations so high that the movie lets you down.&&I just watched the first one and was shocked how enjoyable it was. &&After seeing the high ratings for 2 I decided to watch the original on Netflix. Oh my gosh, what a funny and charming movie! One of my favorite “kid” movies for sure.

It is such a beautiful movie, I was teary-eyed at the ending because t was just so bittersweet. Totally didn’t expect that and I’m so glad I hadn’t read or seen anything about it prior. For those wondering, you don’t have to see the first one to enjoy this one. All you need to know is that the bear loves marmalade sandwiches.&&Paddington the fucking Bear is my shit yo!!! I told all my friends I was gonna watch this and they were like ""wahhh you're gay"" bitch fuck you that shit was LIT!&&I need to see this. The first one was excellent. We need more quality family flicks. &&I can't tell if everyone here genuinely likes Paddington or if it's a joke everyone's in on except for me. I'm seriously anticipating a comment that says ""You guys I have to admit something. I don't actually like Paddington. It's just becoming this running gag for me to say I love it but it's a technological mess PADDINGTON 2 ON THE OTHER HAND IS A MASTERPIECE OHO LOOK AT THOSE GRAPHICS BAYBEE.""

Edit: no I’ve not seen either movie. &&I saw this movie today with a friend to literally an empty theater. We were able to together about how genuinely charming and adorable this film was. The level of fine cinematic detail was truly astonishing, with the sets feeling vibrant, the characters heartwarming (without the typical Hollywood blatant emotional manipulation), and the majority of the jokes hit their mark. Highly recommended,even to adults without children. &&Ok seriously. Are these movies really that fucking good? My kids watch the first one all the time and I just avoid it. &&Wait, those little bear movies are actually good? &&Feel so sorry for anyone too unhappy to find joy in this little bear and feels the need to lash out about it.

Kermode's [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y17hbJAmXb8) hits every nail on every head. Definitely in my top 5 of last year. 

&&Saw this charming film last night and I agree 100% Rotten Tomatoes.&&My husband and I took our children (4, 6, and infant) to see it because of the reviews last Friday. (Note: even the infant loved it! We were just glad to have seen it with no crowd where we could bother anyone!)

Other than Toy Story, this was the film that somehow made us all the same age. We all giggled at the absolute hilarious parts, marveled at the magnificent vistas, and smiled at every endearing part.

We LOVED this movie. I honestly can’t say enough about it. &&> The first film to hold the title was 1999’s Toy Story 2, another sequel. The only other films to have a 100% rating with over 100 reviews are 2008’s Man on Wire (157 reviews) and 2016’s Things to Come (130 reviews).

For those that want to know what the other 3 films were. 

Also apparently Lady Bird should have been up there too but was spoiled by one bad review from a troll.&&I just want to say I'm a grown-ass man and I loved Paddington and I'm excited to see Paddington 2&&Of course, because its effing Paddington! The character is integral in so many people's childhoods. And the fact that they didn't bloat it out, like they do with so many kid movies (The Smurfs, The Chipmunks) with asinine jokes and puns probably helps as well.&&I remember watching the trailer for the first movie thinking it would be one of the worst movies ever. I ended up seeing it anyways and was surprised with how much I liked it. Very rare to find such a heart-warming children's movie that doesn't talk down to it's viewers.&&And then some jackass 'critic' will take advantage of the clickbait opportunity of being 'that one guy' who gave it a bad review.&&That's an awfully nice Rottentomatoes score you've go tthere, it would be a shame if ＡＲＭＯＮＤＷＨＩＴＥ got his hands on it.&&[deleted]&&I can’t help but read all these comments with a british accent &&had to go out and buy a jar of marmalade after watching this&&I saw Paddington playing in a plane once, and I just. Could not get over the CGI rendering of the bear. I looked into those black, black eyes and heard the sounds of Lucifer torturing the souls of the damned.&&I grew up reading Paddington, which I found out is not common for an American. I grew fond of marmalade just because of this bear and his adventures. Now as a near 30 year old man I still feel warmly toward this good intentioned bear and can’t wait to take my daughter to see this one :)&&Is it eligible for best picture this year?&&I saw this movie yesterday. It’s absolutely fantastic. If you don’t like this movie you’re a soulless bastard. &&I guess Armond White hasn't checked in yet.&&You wait until Armond White gets a hold of this.&&We we're convinced it would be bad at best, but were pleasantly surprised. It was moving, well-directed, had some silliness without needing to be disgusting or adult or dumb. Hugh Grant was great. Lots of good messages and touching. &&I thought the first one was better than any family type movies Disneys put out in the last 5+ years (which is saying a lot), so this isn't unexpected.&&Still hard to believe Jeremy Clarkson has anything to do with Paddington&&i just watched the first Paddington movie on Netflix..i thought it was gonna be a stupid kids movie but it was honestly pretty good. I almost cried and im 30...and i never cry at movies lol.

Everyone needs to be more like Paddington.&&Damn, now I'm going to have to take my daughter to see this.  After the first getting such rave reviews and this one seeming so perfect, I might as well.  Plus:  popcorn. &&[deleted]&&The first one, at least, could very well be a good companion piece to Wes Anderson’s filmography.&&A lot of this movie felt like it had heavy Wes Anderson influences.  The color schemes in the prison, the escape via hot air balloon, the stop motion-style animation of the ""popping book,"" the ""traveling"" musicians providing background music, and so on.  Ironically, it also has a trailer for Anderson's next movie before it.

Not complaining, though, I loved this movie with all my heart.&&The director who also did the Mighty Boosh was inspired by Wes Anderson, but I think he really came into his own in the second one. So many great creative choices. It completely deserves the 100%


Like I honestly can’t see how anyone could call this a bad movie&&I just learned that this movie wasnt made by Wes Anderson..

&&My company printed all the striped fabric for that scene, there was 2500m of it altogether. &&Just saw it the other night. It absolutely is. I’ve never had a movie make me feel more warm and fuzzy on the inside.&&Just to add on, I saw it last week (it’s on Netflix) and it was very good. It’s an extremely wholesome flick.&&Absolutely!  It's not only a genuinely fun movie, but also a masterfully crafted movie.  It's quite beautiful throughout!&&I watched the first one this weekend. I thought it was ok. My wife really liked it. Went and saw Paddington 2 on Sunday, and holy crap that was a great movie!!!&&dude, forget the shitty american cut trailer. Paddington is pure 90s magic and wonder. It sits alongside movies like Mathilda or Mrs Doubtfire as instant childhood classics, it's unreal- it's like a favourite childhood film of mine but I saw it as an adult. I can't explain. The morals are so soft and kind and good, it just makes you feel so warm and fuzzy. It's GREAT, dude, go see it whenever you can, and then watch the sequel.

another movie I want to highly, highly reccomend while we're here as this same type of cozy, comfy film: **The BFG** which came out only a few years ago. People passed it over, which confused me, I watched it and it was incredible too, so nice and sweet feeling, a feel-good film about family and love and the lengths one goes to for those whom they consider family even if they just met. It gives you faith in humanity. And visually it's *spectacular*. There's a scene that takes place in a huge magical tree, just... you'll see.

&&Paddington 2 confirmed best anime by penguinz0&&Lol I'm always kind of shocked when I see Cr1tikal stuff upvoted so much on Reddit, I know he has almost 2 million subscribers but I still always feel like he's incredibly under the radar &&I think he liked it (•‿•)&&He’s given other 90’s but like he said in the video, he’s saving that 100% for a mastapiece&&Just watched that moist meter about 10 mins ago and man, it really warmed my heart listening to how much Charlie genuinely enjoyed that movie. His take on it really made me want to watch it. So now I might just go catch it at the movies by myself sometime this week! 

Edit: a word&&He also gave Cuphead a 90%, but if we don't include games, then yes, I'm pretty sure that's his highest rating given.&&the only review that matters&&DO A HUMAN CENTIPEDE &&That was so much better than I expected. Legitimately lovely and artfully done. &&This scene gets even better when you realize it's a homage to the original BBC Paddington animated series from the late 70's, early 80's where Paddington was stop motion and the Browns were cardboard cutouts. It's a brilliant film - took my kids to see it this weekend and we were all crying at the end.&&oh god i thought paddington was gonna sound like a kid or something not like an actual man&&Wow! I had no idea. I haven't heard anything about this franchise before this. I mean, I've seen posters but I didn't know these were good films. I have some Paddington to do.&&Oh, that... that is too charming. &&That was impressive, and fantastic that whole sequence was done in one take&&Do I need to watch the first Paddington before watching this one? &&Holy fuck that was magical.&&Your username made me believe it was going to be from the greatest sequel known to man.&&really not my style of film but I can very much appreciate this scene&&I feel like a degenerate for saying this, but damn I'd love to watch this whole movie on a horrible hangover.  The lovely music, voices and cinematography would so incredibly soothing...&&Beautiful animation&&The animators must have had so much fun making that.&&You're right. Haven't seen either film, but now I'm very interested.&&Man this movie makes me tear up.

I love dat burrr sooo muchhh&&I  grabbing my 19 year old daughter and we are going to see this based off that teaser video. What a wonderful looking movie. &&Beautifully done, but I cannot get over the repeated crowd audio clip with the one person that yells out, ""oh man yeah!"" This is strictly a personal issue and says nothing about the movie. I just had a Tonka construction video game as a kid that used the same audio clip and heard it like once every half hour and grew to despise it.&&Who’s the composer? The music is so nice :)&&I was half expecting Mac and me... Pleasantly surprised&&This clip made me miss being a kid, while at the same time making me feel like one. You kind of forget the awe and wonder that something like a pop-up book can bring. Just a pure, wistful delight and innocence.&&I honestly thought all these top comments were shills and the original post with all these positive upvotes, plus the Rotten Tomatoes scores were all marketing, but that was actually great. I don't know what to believe anymore...&&The first Paddington also had a run with 100% on RT for a time&&I mean it just means everyone definitely enjoyed it, not that it's a brilliant masterpiece. But yea still surprising!&&Solid proof that a genuinely great movie doesn't have to be gritty and edgy, and that fantastic material can be made for both children and adults. &&If meta moves at constant light speed, does it accelerate?&&The most scientifically a bear in a hat in a movie&&r/KenM&&Where did this come from? &&It's a live-action film with a CG title character based on an IP for children.  Other films fitting this description include Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo, and Garfield.  Your initial dismissal is the result of good pattern-recognition skills, so I think you can be forgiven.  That's why we have film critics, after all.  So they can sift through the shit and make us aware of the rare gems like Paddington.&&I hated the trailer for the first one as well and thought it looked like garbage. The first one was incredible. &&I would watch you if you were a movie. &&I took my 8 year old boy to see it today and it was a beautiful movie that both of us really enjoyed. It was able to deliver a really positive message of ""If you look for the good in others you will find it, if you are kind you will be treated with kindness"" in a way that wasn't sappy or cloying. And some of teh animation scenes were just gorgeous. I was beyond impressed. &&The first Paddington movie got 98% at Rotten Tomatoes.

This one got 100%... but still bombed at the box office like the first one.

EDIT: Bombed in the US.&&That's how I watched the trailer for Jumanji. I was all ""The Rock, AND Kevin Hart, this is going to be hot garbage."" Then the reviews came out, and I'm sort of curious now. Not enough to pay to see it in theaters, but still curious.&&It's in the article. 

From the article. 

>The first film to hold the title was 1999’s Toy Story 2, another sequel. The only other films to have a 100% rating with over 100 reviews are 2008’s Man on Wire (157 reviews) and 2016’s Things to Come (130 reviews).&&It doesn't really matter unfortunately, since there are 1-2 asshole reviewers that literally go against the grain on every single thing just to be different (except on 4 occasions, I guess). There's tons of 98-99% movies on there that are no different except ""the guy who always dislikes good movies and likes bad ones managed to dislike this one too"".&&Then again, Armond White has mellowed considerably after he was booted from RT...so maybe he'll like *Paddington 2*.&&Holy shit I never really pay attention to movie critics but I had to look this guy up.

One of the tidbits I found in his rating of Clash of the Titans.

>Leterrier certainly shows a better sense of meaningful, economic narrative than the mess that Peter Jackson made of the interminable, incoherent Lord of the Rings trilogy.

This guy is fucking insane.&&Armond White while being a massive contrarian I still believe is genuine in his opinions. It just may be that he looks at films and their themes in such a way that is so far from how others approach them that I can't help but be morbidly curious of this film opinions.&&And not to get overly sentimental, but it's a genuinely hopeful movie, when it's so easy to be cynical nowadays. Personally I think that sets it above other family movies, even some of the recent Disney ones.&&At that moment, I knew I was in love with this movie. &&Weirdest Doctor Who episode ever&&“I, your village defender!”
“Oh, please!”&&My second favourite gag in the movie and one I plan to work into conversation whenever I can.  I think it will go well at school council meetings.&&I remember absolutely loving Paddington as a kid, but not a lot of other people seem familiar, which is sad.&&I'm in the US, and I used to go to my public library all the time when I was a kid in the 90s (5-10 years old). I still remember picking up the original Paddington books there, and really fell in love with it. I went back several more times and couldn't get enough of all the stories.

My Mom went to England when I was about 10 years old, and one of the souvenirs she brought back was a stuffed Paddington Bear with the tag ""Please Look after this Bear."" I've had that for almost 20 years now!

Both my kids love Paddington Bear now too. They really enjoyed the movies, while my youngest was excited to see the ""old"" stuffed Paddington on the big screen this weekend.

I'm a little bit crazy about Paddington I guess, probably because I identify with his well-meaning attitude and he isn't afraid of getting messy to get the job done.

Anyways, I grew up with Paddington here in the US so it's interesting to see that not many people know who he is!&&The UK had an absolutely delightful stop motion + 2d animation Paddington on the BBC in the late seventies which I feel like cemented that character as a national treasure. It was one of those ones that was repeated for years, I had tapes of it in the 90s. The later cartoons kept the character going, but imo none approach the original for whimsy. &&Don't think so. I'm British in the U.S. and hubby wasn't aware of Paddington.&&Be prepared to feel even more emotional with this one. I had something in my eye by the end.

Best film I saw in 2017.&&[Also has a 89% on Metacritic.](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paddington-2) &&I wonder if it has the same bodycount aswell&&True and that's where the avg rating of 8.6 comes in.

That's quite a good score&&Positive being generally defined as a 6/10 or above I believe. So a movie could have 100 reviews that all rank as a 6/10 and it would have a 100% even though the consensus is just that it's barely above average.&&Except in this case it is the best movie in existence.&&I felt the same, but honestly the sequel blew me away. 

I don't think the first one is one of the best movies for children ever, but the second really is up there.&&I was babysitting tonight and watched it expecting to be bored but I actually liked it a lot! I was pleasantly surprised, now I want to see the sequel &&This made me bust out laughing. Idek why. &&I have a feeling this'll be the quote to make the box art..

And I'm completely okay with that.&&I'm nearly 40, can someone translate this for me?&&> PADDINGTON 2 ON THE OTHER HAND IS A MASTERPIECE OHO LOOK AT THOSE GRAPHICS BAYBEE.""

###**KNACK IS BACK BITCHES**&&100% from critics, 90% from audience on RT. No joke. &&No people are serious, it’s a wonderful movie. &&Genuine. Great flicks.&&I like em. In the first one Paddington straight up murders a bitch with a sandwich&&Basically, the films are VERY well made - the visuals and music are absolutely stunning. The plot is nothing revolutionary and quite campy, but the storytelling, performances and messages are incredibly wholesome (the overarching theme is just to be kind and polite to people, which is something we all need reminding of from time to time). The humour is a good mix of silly slapstick and visual comedy with some very dry British absurdism and wordplay, and as a result I think there's something in there for the whole family. 

It's not a groundbreaking film that will change the world, but it's incredibly pure, goodhearted and well executed. It's really hard to dislike, and really all too easy to love. &&Great, even. First one is a ton of fun and really really sweet. Second is a masterpiece, I think.&&Next, 200% Rotten Tomatoes...it's that good.&&Can confirm, am grown as man that loved Paddington also.  Totally ready to watch the second one. Going to watch the first one again first.  I think I saw that it was available on Netflix or hulu or something recently.&&It's called a hard stare. His Aunt Lucy taught him to use them when people have forgotten their manners.&&Probably not this year it isnt&&It is eligible for the BAFTA (it was nominated for three awards including Hugh Grant for Best Supporting Actor), but the they released too late in the US to be considered for the Academy Awards. &&This made me so excited to see it. I loved the first one. &&> The color and camerawork in these moves reminds me of a mix between Wes Anderson and Jean Pierre Jeunet (Amelie.) Everything is so bold and vibrant and artfully composed and kinetic. 

That's the style of director Paul King. The bits of surrealism you can see in all his works. The Mighty Boosh, Bunny and the Bull, etc.&&Even the cross-section scenes e.g. when all the prisoners jump down into the pipe.&&>  the stop motion-style animation of the ""popping book,

Thank you!&&Noel Fielding? &&Or on the outside! &&Fuzzy wuzzy was....paddington bear.&&>I’ve never had a movie make me feel more warm and fuzzy on the inside.

Ponyo comes to mind for me. I should check out Paddington. &&I've got to be honest, the trailers i saw made it look, at best, a dumb for-kids-only slapstick film, and at worst a cash grab trying to take advantage of my childhood. I'm vaguely surprised that everyone is saying it was good. May have to go watch it.&&Did you see the original Paddington? Because I didn't and I'm sure that would influence my decision.&&Moonrise Kingdom made me feel that way, then I ended up kinda feeling sad~&&Will I understand the sequel if I watch it without checking out the first one?&&as an immigrant that moved to London 25 years ago, this movie is really close to my heart.&&If you grew up with the Peanuts cartoons, you should definitely watch the Peanuts movie that came out last year. It is non-stop happiness.&&The second one is better and requires no prior knowledge of the first. I laughed a lot in the second one, but I'm not sure if the humor is for everyone. &&That’s helpful to know that it’s on netflix. Thanks &&Hmmm, feeling depressed as of late, maybe I should give it a go? I'm just easily dismissive of it since I'm 25&&That's good to know the 2nd one is better, i thought the first paddington was just ok, nothing amazing about it. &&He is, relative to the time he's been around. &&Red letter media has less than 700k and I feel like they get way more attention around here&&There are dozens of us.&&We watched the first one this weekend and it was delightful, I was shocked. Can’t wait to see P2. &&I did not expect my jaw to drop. &&Scenes like this are why we shouldn't give low-effort cash grab shit like Minions a pass just because it's ""for kids"". Kids deserve to experience well-crafted, enriching movies just as much as adults do. In fact, it's even *more* important that they do if we want the next generation of filmgoers to have any kind of standards. I grew up during the golden age of Pixar movies, (Toy Story 3 came out right before I became a teenager) and looking back, I'm so glad I did, because it definitely helped lead me to expect a good story in my movies. I've still yet to experience a superhero movie as fundamentally well-executed, satisfying and *rewatchable* as The Incredibles. And even as a kid, I could tell that Finding Nemo and Shark Tale were *not* the same just because they both had fish in them. People should be able to watch their childhood favorites and realize *why* they liked them so much, not think ""Oh god, I can't believe I used to watch this"". 

But going back to that scene... wow. That's the kind of scene that gets young minds interested in filmmaking.&&Came here to see if anyone else was old enough to remember the BBC cartoon series of Paddington that they are paying a massive homage to here!

Here's a link:

https://youtu.be/hdVPymvBCm8&&It's Ben Whishaw. Also Q in James Bond.&&Colin Firth was originally cast as Paddington lol&&Enjoy!&&Nah, if you look closely, when the pages turn, you can see where they made cuts.  They're well-disguised cuts, though.&&Alejandro González Iñárritu just keeps nailing it. &&lol&&I can't believe they had the audacity to rip off Birdman like that.&&Bravo Nolan &&You will probably be fine, but there will be some confusing bits.

Just as a brief summary of the first, Paddington, was supposed to met up with his estranged wife for Christmas.  She had a high powered corporate job and custody of the kids.  So, Paddington lands at the airport and takes a limo over to her work's Christmas party.  All of he co-workers are sleazy 80s business types.  Well, the party gets attacked by a group of German thieves trying to break into the company's vault.  Paddington has to fight off the terrorist in order to save his wife, and the rest of the office.  There are some pretty good fight, and Paddington gets some good one-liners.  In the end he shoots Han Gruber off of the top of the skyscraper.

That should cover most of the important parts.&&Nah&&Not really, but you should watch it anyway. It's on Netflix and it's a delightful movie.&&It's not necessary as you can grasp a lot quite easily, but the first one really makes the second one feel all the more special. If you have Netflix it's on there and I recommend watching it before seeing Paddington 2&&The first one is worth watching, and the second has a lot of callback references to the first, but they are standalone plots, and the second does a great job of introducing its world and characters on its own. 

Source: saw the second before the first and loved it. &&How exactly does his username relate to Speed 2: Cruise Control?&&Terminator 2?&&> Your username made me believe it was going to be from the greatest sequel known to man.

[SUPA MARIO BROTHERS TWO](https://youtu.be/Y3Y1lbG0HkI?t=411), BAY-BEE.&&Crank 2?&&The whole movie isn't animated like that :)&&You could totally make that happen. Please start a blog of best and worst movies for a hangover. I can be a contributor. Think of a witty name and get back to me&&I'm gonna out-degenerate you and say ""acid comedown.""&&First one is on Netflix. &&man bring tissues&&I'm so with you on this. I started being cynical at a pretty young age and never realised how much sparkle gets taken out of the world as a result. I took my nephews to see the first Paddington and I got really emotional at being repositioned to find some magic in the everyday again. The second film had the same effect. 

I know this is super lame, but the only other time this happened was when I went to Disney World for the first time - at 25 (I grew up/live in London). I went with some family and was convinced I'd find it all cringey and I'd be too old to enjoy it. But every moment, capped off with the fireworks at the end, made me feel like a kid again and I couldn't help but cry a little. 

We all need reminding to be a bit more positive sometimes. I think that's why Paddington has successfully charmed so many viewers. &&You really think that a british movie about some cute little bear has the money to pay over 100 critics and dozens of people on reddit to promote their movie?

Paddington 2 is even nominated for three BAFTAs, believe that it has the potential to give you 2 hours of joy. &&Being skeptical of viral marketing ploys is good but you can take it too far. Sometimes good movies just get good reviews&&I wonder if I should be ashamed for never seeing either especially living in the UK. &&I feel like these 100% runs usually come to an end when some contrarian critic writes a negative review just to get some publicity for themselves and their outlet.&&This is my biggest gripe with RT. It's a measure of ""how many people thought it was at least ok"" not ""how good is it"". And everyone confuses the two.&&No it travels at c.&&Only if it changes direction and/or enters a refractive medium&&/r/2meta2fast&&/r/NotKenM&&https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7qg7oq/the_nuke_scene_from_t2_is_still_one_of_the_most/&&People posting stuff like this to /r/videos:

Shamelessly shitty movies that seem to be cash grabs. I will be sure to add this and the first one to my list of films to check out this year.&&Bruh Scooby-Doo is a good fucking movie funny for kids and kids that grew up on the show&&What Paddington distinct itself from other live-action-CG hybrid adaptations of kids cartoons and books is that it's humor is very original and pays homage than parodying its influences.&&TJ Miller was great in Yogi Bear 3D&&I loved Alvin and the Chipmunks when I was about eight.     
Then when I was in high school, I had a friend over and we were looking for a movie to watch and I was like, oh look, I loved this movie when I was a kid, wanna watch Alvin and the Chipmunks? We watched it for about half an hour before we switched to Mary Poppins, which will always be a timeless classic.       
EDITED: People were freaking out about the eight thing. I looked it up and apparently I was eleven when it came out. I now feel ashamed of my preteen taste. (Though I COULD have been eight when I saw it and in my freshman year of college now. Chew on that.)&&As absurd as this will sound, The Smurfs animated movie that just came out is legitimate. The travesty that was the live action, CG mix was bad but this is a good movie. Good script and excellent timing and execution of the jokes.&&That pattern you’re describing is directors thinking they don’t have to work as hard because it’s a children film,and that kids won’t know the difference. It’s pure laziness if you ask me. &&It *almost* makes me hopeful for Peter Rabbit.

Almost.&&But... 100%?! &&Paddington isn’t anything like those films though.

Paddington is genuinely fucking great. &&Dang the trailer is the reason I didn't watch it. It was so bad. &&The trailer was so stupid.

I was horrified at a beloved character getting a crass potty humor faux action adaptation Smurf style.

Actually saw movie and discovered awesome.&&What was incredible about it? I know absolutely nothing about these movies. But now I’m interested &&That's the one where Paddington is like an oafish buffoon with literal toilet humor? I also skipped this movie.&&The first one made $270 million on a $50 million budget. 

The second one is at $150 million on the same budget, but only just release in the US and is likely to have good word of mouth. 

They definitely didn’t bomb...&&You have a strange definition of 'bombed.'&&Lady Bird had a 100% for a minute there&&I swear Toy Story 1 and 2 had 100% and 3 had 99%. Then again, I haven't checked in a LOOOONG time.&&Thought Man on Wire was pretty mediocre.

Was annoyed that The Dark Knight score was ruined by a couple of petty bitches.&&I thought Get Out also had that distinction. That one dick reviewer ... https://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelblackmon/get-out-rotten-tomatoes-99&&I didn’t know they booted him. I loved the comments section of his reviews back when RT still had them. &&Rofl hadn’t heard about that but it looks like RT didnt want somebody Nestoring the place up. &&He's been back on rotten tomatoes for a while. He was the first person to give Get Out a negative review. 

It's not even his occasional score spoiling tendencies that I hate, it's his atrocious writing. The guy just throws in big words to make himself sound smart, without considering how putting all of the words in a sentence turns it into nonsense.&&He was impressive. He managed to agree with the tomato meter exactly 50% of the time for 1.5 years. It’s almost like he set out to give an equal portion of bad and good scores, but ironically. 

50% is insanely low when you think about 10% and 95% fresh movies being in the mix. 

I no longer hold an ill will against him, and I was one of those nasty RT commenters. 1) Why am I wasting time over the score of a product I am not a part of? And 2) his reviews actually have academic value *because* they’re contrarian, not despite. I say “Transformers 2 is a shit movie” and he says “hold on my glasses, I’ll list reasons why it’s redeemable.”

Sure, Lady Bird is wonderful, but reading 100 reviews praising it won’t stimulate my inner critic. Reading a purposefully negative review makes me actually appreciate it more, knowing it has perceived flaws and is imperfectly perfect, and also Armond White has a good eye for good and bad films, so a bad review usually means a good film. &&Not too different from his self appointed protector of Earth status as the doctor&&Yeah I feel it's like tin tin, beloved outside the US while virtually unknown here (besides a small cult following)&&Slightly more actually, Paddington's wife and children are killed midway through the movie, and he takes up arms against whole criminal underbelly of the city, it is pretty fucked up actually. &&Basically, no one hates it. That’s still impressive.&&But remember, you still shouldn't get your expectations too high. It might be the best movie in existence, but you might be too stupid to get it. Please, just keep that in mind and temper your expectations, if your stupid little pea brain can keep that thought for longer than a cat's fart. &&Is Paddington 2 the new Paul Blart: Mall Cop?&&Maybe cus im a 25 y/o male that plays sports and lifts and the fact that I am attached to a bear is comical. at least that's why I laugh. I love bears, they are the coolest animals in my opinion. &&Paddington the (inserted curse word because immature) Bear, I like him as a friend. I told all of my friends that I was going to watch this movie and they reacted in a very condescending manner, but I still enjoyed it. &&A talking bear wearing a hat? This is where I draw the line. Come on Master Chief, let's get the fuck outta here. &&One does not simply joke about Paddington bear.&&It's the *Godfather 2* of family movie franchises. &&I watched it today with my kids, they and I loved it.&&Both movies are so highly rated but I could never get myself to watch them. I haven't even seen a trailer but they seem too wholesome and nice for me to watch....I feel too jaded to watch nice feel good movies about a teddy bear anymore. Maybe I'll sit down one day and watch it....I'm sure I'll love it.&&Yeah, the whole dollhouse things was textbook Anderson.&&Paul King.
&&Felding. I saw his standup in Hollywood about a year ago. Man, that guy is batshit crazy but loved it. &&( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&More at 11.&&Ponyo ponyo ponyo ponyo ponyo pooooon&&I wouldn't have thought of that, but yeah, Paddington did have sort of a Miyazaki feel to it. That same sort of whimsical slice of life vibe to it that somehow makes you feel warm and fuzzy. &&The trailers were dogshit. Even though I’ve heard good things about it for a long time, I think that’s the subconscious reason why I didn’t sit down and watch it.&&Yeah, thanks. Now I’m a single 28 year old male watching a movie about an animated bear.

Edit: I liked it and I’m not one bit ashamed to admit it.&&Not on Canadian Netflix. :-/&&Oh man if you’re feeling depressed you will fucking love this bear. &&Do it. And don't forget to stay through the credits. &&Paddington 2 is like hot chocolate chip cookie soup for the soul.&&I'm 44.  It's wonderful.  

(I don't have kids to ""force"" me to watch it either, it was my own free will.)&&Paddington is a bear who despite the ugliness in this world finds good in everything he does and everyone he meets. His attitude is absolutely heartwarming and he changes the world around him due to his innocence. It is absolutely the perfect movie to watch if you’ve been feeling a bit down lately. &&Do I need to to see the first one to see the second? Will I be out of the loop if I don’t?&&P2: Judgement Day&&I've never seen Paddington and now sad I didn't have that in my childhood. It looks gorgeous and so... wholesome. &&i've had the theme tune running through my head since i opened this thread&&Ahh you’ve just reminded me that I need to watch London Spy. Love me some Mr. Whishaw.&&As adorable in real life as Paddington is in the movie.&&Why lol? I could see him working aswell.&&Paper cuts.&&It is not so much the cuts as the folds which stand out to me here. &&Isn’t it all just digital? So it really is a a single take?&&It just made me lol to think of one of the popup pages not flipping up properly and them having to do the entire scene all over again from the top.&&I was two sentences in, and I was like WTF is going on in this movie. Then it became clear. It's die hard. Have an upvote&&Rumor has it they were going to call the first one Paddington Takes Nakatomi Tower but they were afraid it would seem too much like a ""beloved teddy bear goes King Kong in LA"" flick. &&Thank you for your time.&&I'm sorry, it seems you've misspelled

That said, I caught the first one with my nephew and it was fantastic and will definitely be using him as an excuse to see the new one.&&Right. A movie where 75% of people thought this is pretty good, and 25% thought it was utter garbage will have the same Rotten Tomatoes rating as a film where 75% of people thought it was a genre-defining masterpiece, and 25% thought it was okay but failed to deliver.&&no that's a boat&&which can usually be found inside of a half built Chinese air purifying tower.&&If you visit /r/KenM and /r/NotKenM, will you see everything in the universe?&&And then... https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7qkzoh/the_bees_scene_from_the_wicker_man_is_still_one/dsq923f/&&Those are the parodies.&&I pretty much only watch Pixar when it comes to CG movies.

I won't pretend it's good, but I love it.&&aint no shit better than shaggy turning up to the museum grand opening in the sequel dressed as a blunt and being greeted by stoners.&&The Scooby-Doo movies are fucking awesome...people throwing shade better get ready to catch these paws &&Paddington may be a decent movie, but it doesn't have [Sugar Ray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQhMIyjneQ) does it!?&&Yeah Bree Olson is great in that movie. Only like 30 minutes too &&It's a perfect Scooby movie except for the reveal at the end, which is excusable because the reveal is supposed to make you hate it and does its job perfectly. &&It's his magnum opus&&Wait, that movie didn't come out that long ago, how could you be 8 and then was in high school at some point since then?

......*cries in corner at age*&&Holy shit I'm old now&&Sounds like a lame ass night &&I honestly didn't even know there was a purely animated Smurfs movie.&&Forgive me for assuming, but this seems to be where you and many people confuse the 100% for an A+ grade movie. The 100% simply means 100% of the critics rated this movie with a favorable grade - not all A+'s. In fact, the average critic score is 8.6/10.&&I think you missed the point he was making.&&It's on Netflix, if you want to watch it. &&I'm a 28 year old man with no children who went to see Paddinton 2 opening weekend, and I'm going to insist you watch Paddington 1 and 2. &&Agreed, tbh. It completely failed to capture the feel of the film.

I wonder whether the marketing people were told to 'sell it to kids'.

&&Great kids movie. I laughed a few times.&&Not to mention that kid movies generally make a lot of their money on the back-end.  Streaming, DVD and Blu-ray sales, stuffed bears, etc.&&Isn't a majority made in the UK and Europe where Paddington is more well known? That alongside the sales of Paddington merch as well which I heard really soared following the first movie. Especially the purchases and searching for marmalade and marmalade recipies&&Obviously any movie that does well enough to get a sequel greenlit is a bomb.&&Before that one guy labeled his review as ""rotten"" becuase he didn't like the fact that the film was at 100%.&&Lady Bird had 100% for almost a month.  It's score is technically 99.9954%, because it has only 1 negative review out of 216. Apparently Rotten Tomatoes doesn't round up. 

Edit: the ""almost a month"" was based on Lady Bird's release day, and not the first review. Lady Bird had 0 negative reviews (therefore a 100%) for 99 days. &&I think Toy Story just doesn’t have 100 reviews, since it was released prior to the Internet being a huge thing &&> Thought Man on Wire was pretty mediocre.

As long as everyone gave it a 6/10 (which I'd class as mediocre as opposed to bad or disappointing), then it'd maintain it's 100% Fresh score.&&There seems to be a lot of confusion going around, and not just in this comment section but others I've seen. It was Cole Smithey who gave Lady Bird the Rotten review, not Armond White.&&Armond's interesting. I tend to disagree with a lot of what he says. But at the same time, he does raise good points and I do agree with some of it. At least I can credit Armond with being consistent in what lens he brings to movies.

Normally contrarians irritate me. Since many of them do it just for the sake of being different and against the grain.  Rather than an intellectually honest reason that stems from having a unique perspective. In Armond's case his reviews of Blade Runner 2049, Justice League and Valerian, the comments he made had some salience to them. But he seems to chronically dock movies for not fitting his mold for what a movie should be. Instead of letting movies be themselves.&&Ha, I dug Tintin as a kid, too. Either I was weird, or I just liked a lot of things.... &&I'm giving this comment a hard stare.&&No, Paddington 2 is legit great. People actually aren’t joshing around for once. &&no because it's unironically good&&Thanks!&&It’s incredibly well done.

&&It was you, Paddington. You broke my heart.&&I read a reviewer call it ""the Godfather 2 of Peruvian bear films"" which gave me a good snort.&&I didn't enjoy Godfather 2 as mush as the first. Change my opinion?&&Do I need to see Pad1 or can I jump right into the sequel. I had no plans to watch it but that RT score got me curious. Besides I've already seen most movies worth watching,  thank you MoviePass!&&Found the furry!&&Won't be single for long now&&yo, same! Single 28 year old male watching a movie about an animated bear bros!&&Some of us were single 28-year-old men who saw it alone in the theater to the confused and at times condemning stares of parents also in attendance. &&If you've seen the Ted films, I have news for you...&&I just found myself in this exact predicament. &&Canada can just look outside for talking bears, tho&&Nick Fury:  ""Paddington, have you heard of ""The Avengers""?  We could use a man of your talents.""&&I was with you until ""soup.""&&Nope &&He recorded lines for the whole film, but they realised his voice just didn't fit the final product and found Ben wishall instead. Even Firth has said since that they made the right choice, and Ben's voice fits the character much better than his.&&Yes, it was a joke, just like his was :)&&Makes me think that the cameraman is just chucking the camera through holes in the book&&How did you manage to misspell Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior?&&I think you mean Freddy Got Fingered 2: Daddy Would You Like Some Sausage? &&Wrong again.  Blair Witch 2.&&I could do some of the drinking & watching too! I'm not much a critic when I'm hungover, but we'll see what happens.&&Oooh!  Ooooh!  Imagine a series of cocktails named after the Jaegars from Pacific Rim!

Want Want&&Flip it, Martini Matinees is better &&S-....Space Jam is good....&&[“Who Framed Roger Rabbit?](https://www.tor.com/2017/03/03/kristian-williams-analyzes-who-framed-roger-rabbit/) is a masterpiece.&&No it travels at sí.&&Obviously.&&yes! finally I will know my crush likes me!&&You may wanna try some of the recent Disney cg movies like Tangled, Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph and such. Disney cg increased dramatically in quality once John Lasseter (of Pixar) start overseeing them&&Well it’s a live action movie with a cg main character. Not really a CG movie. &&Gonna second /u/SpehlingAirer here and suggest that you look into  all the Disney films since *Tangled*, inclusively.

Admittedly, I haven't actually seen *Tangled* myself, but I have heard no end of praise. And I have seen *Wreck-It Ralph*, *Frozen*, *Big Hero 6*, *Zootopia*, and *Moana* and they're all fantastic.&&IMO since Toy Story 3 Pixar lost their touch a bit and the other CG studios have caught up and often surpass them. The things that are now possible in CG really let writers' and voice actors' imaginations off the hook.

Other people have mentioned the really good stuff Disney has done since Lasseter took over, but Dreamworks have some solid stuff in Trolls, Turbo, The Croods, Megamind & Captain Underpants. Shrek never really got up to the mark, but the Kung-Fu Panda trilogy is wonderful, followed by the Dragons movies. Madagascar got better with each episode, and the last Penguins was top notch.

Blue Sky aren't quite there yet, but the Rio films are enjoyable. Ice Age is just a bit too daft, though the third one is quite good fun.

Sony have been doing well with the Hotel Transylvania movies and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 1 & 2.

Illumination have been bleeding the whole Minion thing dry, though the Despicable Me films have their moments. The Lorax was their modern highlight though. No-one has done Seuss that well before or since.

My favourites elsewhere are The Book of Life (much better than Coco) and The Lego Movie. We're in a bit of a golden age of animation right now.&&Are you joking? Each of those actors embodied their role so well. It's a masterpiece.&&I feel the same way about the live action Cat in the Hat. 

It's really not a good movie, but at the same time, it's pretty fucking funny&&Friendly reminder that scooby doo’s full name is scoobert doo&&I want the rated R version so bad. I can't believe James Gunn wrote that movie.&&""No, grandma! Don't eat the kitty!""

That's one of my favorite childhood movies.&&Rt it's a great movie that appeals to kids and adults, not everything has to be shawshank redemption &&God dammit. Guess I'm watching Scooby Doo tonight.&&That movie is a masterpiece&&The pinnacle of talking bear comedy.&&It went over as just okay in my family. The kids and I both enjoyed Trolls a LOT more than Smurfs. More clever writing and jokes imo... so we never watched Smurfs again after the first watch, whereas Trolls (and Moana) got about 100 each 😑&&Turning it on now thanks to these comments.

Danny McBride's 'Crocodile Dundee' Film Confirmed To Be Fake,38535,7srhnq,http://screencrush.com/truth-behind-mcbride-dundee-movie/,1981,1516836662.0,,"Machete was a fake trailer once, too.&&I love how the author of this article acts as if this was an obvious fake to anyone and everyone. Hollywood just made the Emoji movie for fuck's sake. This was perfectly plausible and would have been Shakespeare by comparison.&&It was all for promoting travel to Australia.

If the idea was to get more people to come, they should advertise some areas that have the lowest population density of deadly animals.&&They created a fake movie tons of people would go see. The joke's on us, they won't make all that money!&&Was fun while it lasted I guess.&&netflix should buy the rights and make it&&Confirmed. It’s not a knife.&&Genuinely disappointed &&Well that's a shame.

I'm all for another Crocodile Dundee movie and anything with Paul Hogan in general. But I guess it is a bit too ridiculous to think something like this, with high profile American actors, could stay under the radar this long.

But give Tourism Australia credit: They did a good job fooling us for these past two weeks.&&Too fucking bad. They missed out on my 20$&&> it seemed pretty obvious to anyone with at least one working eyeball that Danny McBride’s Crocodile Dundee sequel was not exactly…how do you say…real.         

r/iamverysmart &&For anyone out of the loop: https://youtu.be/TTpsjzMutCI&&The reaction to this commercial may inspire an actual movie. A lot of people seem genuinely disappointed by this news and that includes myself. On paper, this is an easy concept that could potentially work well if executed properly. Rather than Hogan being a ""fish out of water"" in New York, McBride will be the same in Australia. The predicated synopsis of McBride being a man in search of his father works great and he could easily portray the needed American stereotype. Like many, I talked myself into wanting this movie.&&It won't be fake for long&&Damn, Huge McBride fan, I thought it looked funny. You all should check out the HBO series vice principals. &&I’ve seen stupider movie ideas turned into movies &&I love how both the “aw that’s sad” and “thank god” comments are getting equal amount of upvotes” &&We suck again!&&I don't know about anyone else, but I was more excited to see this fake movie than any other movie coming out.&&boo...&&I’m fake disappointed. No really. Make this movie. &&Idk about anybody else but I legit wanted to see a Danny McBride Crocodile Dundee film. The man is absolutely vivid in just about any role he's in. Hell, he's the third best part of Alien Covenant (the first two being Michael Fassbender, of course).&&That’s not a movie... _this_ is a MOVIE&&You hyped me up, cunts. All for nothing. &&**Bull**. *Shit*.

Before I rant, there was [a newer trailer featuring Chris Hemsworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PkfLEbMba4) that was released. Don't ignore this because [there's also an official website](https://dundeemovie.com) and it still follows the release date of the film.

Back on topic. Hogan *directly said* that [he wanted to bring the character to a newer generation and thought this would be a great idea](http://people.com/movies/danny-mcbride-is-crocodile-dundees-son-in-exclusive-first-look-at-mysterious-project/). This wasn't a fucking ploy for humor - he **meant** to do this and people ripped this shit. I'd rather have sensible people give him constructive criticism and not this bullshit that [The Guardian said about the original films being ""sexist, racist, and homophobic""](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/23/crocodile-dundee-was-sexist-racist-and-homophobic-lets-not-bring-that-back).

I *do* believe this character could return but not in a third installment since the franchise never opened a broad universe. A reboot/remake that dives deeper in its themes and fucks with the audience with no restraint would be better than this. We need an R-rated Dundee movie that's a love-letter to the fans while introducing newer audiences to the character.

Maybe that's just me but it's only fair if this was a thought.&&Really?&&Dang!&&> And the director credited for the film is Steve Rogers, an award-winning commercial director who’s helmed ads for Nike, Old Spice and Audi.

I'm glad Cap was able to find a career outside of the military. &&Fuck another remake/sequel WTF Hollywood stop it with these.  We are so sick of this, how about you make something original.... oh its fake.. awww that would have been awesome to see.  Lets start a movement to make this happen!&&Somehow I think I’m the only one that thinks Danny McBride is literally the worst person to play the son of Crocodile Dundee. &&Fake news. Sad. &&We can make it real.  We have the power.&&Awful news&&Awwwwwww&&Well that sure is disappointing. &&Too bad&&Well that was a wasted opportunity &&I gotta give credit to Weekly Planet Podcast for calling this out last Sunday on the podcast. They even said it was for traveling too. If you guys are on here, kudos!&&It’s mean to play with people’s feelings this way.&&Fine, don't take my money.&&the chemistry between McBride and Hemsworth looks like it had a lot of potential &&They have a whole website dedicated to a film and Release date and two teaser trailers and all sorts of shit to promote it as a movie. Seems a little overboard for a fake movie&&Just like the fake Ferris Bueller sequel Volkswagen put out a few years ago. ""Wow that's super disappointing. That thing I was excited about turned out to be making fun of me for being excited. I guess I'll buy this tangentially related product"". - Said not one person ever. A better advertising campaign would have been "" Come visit Australia. 4% of our indigenous wildlife are non-lethal!"" At least that would be factually accurate.&&Thank God&&If only Danny McBride was confirmed to be fake.&&THANK GOD&&No, no! This can’t be! I... I have to have fallen asleep. I had to have fallen asleep and now I’m having a bad dream that I stayed up, right?

In all seriousness, I am genuinely somewhat disappointed. The “movie” trailer in its’ current state left much to be desired to some people but Danny McBride is just such an entertaining guy. I feel like if it was an actual film with a budget and effort it could be something good, you know?&&I can’t believe the anti-Dundee sentiment by the chap writing for the Guardian newspaper. Claiming the film to be misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and all other things.

When will people grow up and realise that Crocodile Dundee is about a guy who has no concept of how to live out of the outback, has no experience with gay or trans people, is a typical alpha male... and also, it was a film made in the 80s. 

How many movies from the 20s through to the 00s would now be considered bigoted in some way? As someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s, and enjoyed tons of movies like that (Beverly hills cop/lethal weapon/die hard kind of movies come to mind), it frustrates me that people can’t just enjoy them for what they are and accept that movies made then didn’t have the rules that movies have now. &&Australia just collectively breathed a sigh of relief &&Well that's one less Danny McBride project I'll have to avoid. &&FUCK. I was genuinely hyped. &&Can we all admit that would’ve been an awesome film tho? I was super excited &&:'(&&Thank God.&&well this is the saddest i've been in a while. &&Hahaha, they got me....&&:(((&&Ok while I respect Danny McBride’s huge talent, if a 2018 Crocodile Dundee remake didn’t star one of the Hemsworth brothers I don’t know what exactly the fuck the point would be.&&The guys on the podcast The Weekly Planet speculated it was for a superbowl ad, perhaps for Australian tourism.  This still could be the case.&&FUCK. I would have loved this! &&Oh good &&Fake trailer for the next tropic thunder, that movie has fake trailers in the beginning of the film. &&""And the director credited for the film is Steve Rogers, an award-winning commercial director who’s helmed ads for Nike, Old Spice and Audi.""

Now someone will actually try to make it happen.&&Thank God &&thank fucking God.&&Thank God &&Thank god. &&Oh thank God.&&Thankfully.&&Thank Goodness

I just told my wife about it tonight, and in no way did I preface it with any hesitation on its validity.&&Yeah they don't seem so sure it's a fake in [their original article](http://screencrush.com/dundee-danny-mcbride-wtf/).&&Was looking for this comment, the author seemed pretentious af.&&Yeah.  I don't know why anyone would doubt this for a second.  The author is giving Hollywood way to much credit.  And themselves. I doubt it was as obvious to them as they make it seem.&&Just a reminder to everyone. The Emoji movie will be on Netflix next month. Netflix also had Boss Baby which was nominated for an Oscar. Just wanted everyone to know that Netflix has quality programming coming your way.&&The top comments were all how it was probably fake for an ad when this was posted last week.&&It gets even funny, the very next article when you scroll down the page is from that same author, 2 days before, wondering if the trailer is for real or not

Albert scrambled up and pulled at some of the huge volumes, finally dislodging enough of them for his master to clamber free.  
HMM... Death picked up a book at random and read the cover. ""DANGEROUS MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, FISH, JELLYFISH, INSECTS, SPIDERS, CRUSTACEANS, GRASSES, TREES, MOSSES, AND LICHENS OF TERROR INCOGNITA, "" he read. His gaze moved down the spine. VOLUME 29C, he added. OH. PART THREE, I SEE.  
He glanced up at the listening shelves. POSSIBLY IT WOULD BE SIMPLER IF I ASKED FOR A LIST OF THE HARMLESS CREATURES OF THE AFORESAID CONTINENT?  
They waited.  
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT-  
""No, wait master. Here it comes.""  
Albert pointed to something white zigzagging lazily through the air. Finally Death reached up an caught the single sheet of paper.  
He read it carefully and then turned it over briefly just in case anything was written on the other side.  
""May I?"" said Albert. Death handed him the paper.  
""'Some of the sheep, '"" Albert read aloud. ""Oh, well. Maybe a week at the seaside'd be better, then.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Theatre Manager/Projectionist,

ATTENTION: 
There is a unique situation with the ""TROPIC THUNDER"" feature, please note below information before you put together your feature prints.

""TROPIC THUNDER"" is a “film within a film” themed movie. The actors are playing actors in a film. In keeping with that theme there are three fake trailers at the beginning of the film that are part of the feature. Please do not get confused and clip off these three “previews” as they are part of the film and help to establish the main characters.

You will notice that these “fake” trailers do not have MPAA rating bands because they are part of reel number one. 

The actual attached trailer on this film is EAGLE EYE and it does have an MPAA Green Band on the head of the trailer. 

If you have any questions or are unclear at all please call Deluxe Film Services at [REMOVED]

Thank you in advance for your assistance and we ask that you share this information with your whole team in case there is any confusion on the part of the film goers as well.

MAIN ATTACHED:
Eagle Eye

ENCLOSED (Please select a few of these to run with the ""TROPIC THUNDER"" feature)

* Max Payne
* Bolt
* An American Carol
* Hamlet 2
* Role Models
* Lakeview Terrace
* Ghost Town
* Righteous Kill
* Disaster Movie
* College
* Body of Lies
* Sex Drive
* The Women

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway the studios also send people around on opening day to make sure that cinemas are playing only those correct trailers with the film. The woman turns up with a checksheet, starts ticking off the trailers being ran and the piece of paper has a sheet to label any unauthorized trailers. She ended up writing down the fake trailers in that section. So she runs up to the projection booth ""Why are you running these trailers with that film? We haven't authorized it"". Of course my cousin hands over the sheet of paper from Paramount/Dreamworks saying about those trailers and she accepts that information and leaves. 

Thing is, you'd would have thought the studio would have warned these people about the fake trailers.&&My conservative mother got these early screening tickets to see a Tropic Thunder which had Ben Stiller in it, you know the guy from Night at the Museum. When the ads went through my face went pale white as she just pursed her lips. We sat there the whole film with me trying to hold it in and her watching disapproving. She only stayed because they were free tickets to a movie theater and did not want to be someone who left a movie that we drove across town to see.&&Reminds me of seeing Mask of Zorro in the theater. Twords the end of the film Anthony Hopkins' character dies and someone near towards the back of the theater lets out this comically dramatic ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"". It was so hilarious the whole theater erupted into laughter during what was meant to be a dramatic part of the movie. &&And no one saw it coming, three more times.&&I didn't say Lance, I said...*Nance*&&Here we go again..... Again.&&Hobo with a shotgun is non-ironically one of my favorite movies. I'm blown away to find out that people hate it.&&I said the same thing about anchorman, and now about Black Dynamite. 

Only they wern't in the 80s but still 1 off cult classics should stay that way. These sequels are just shitty money grabs.&&I really don't think so anymore.

There was a time where you could make a movie and no-one would know of it until release and it becomes an overnight sensation.  There was also a time when the main villain wasn't even advertised.

Now I can find out about any movie that's getting made in the next 5 years just by looking at this subreddit.&&I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure they bought the script and then changed the ending. The movie wasn't already done and in post production. &&When you swim in the sea,

I'll try to find it, but if I can, I'll offer some help. Just one question: what sounds more interesting:
1) A cowardly wizard accidentally being a hero, mostly while running away and being a bit of a dick?
2) The anthropomorphic character of Death, getting way more involved in human affairs than he really should?
3) The slow development of a medieval ish city filled with terrible characters and mystery (occasionally)? Centers around the City Watch.
4) Sassy witches, fighting evil and coming to remarkable realizations about morality?

There are smaller other threads you can pull, but those are the major themes to start with.

They each start with:
1) The Colour of Magic
2) Mort (the argument could be made for Reaper Man, but I think Mort, while it does come second, is a better place to start)
3) Guards! Guards!
4) Equal Rites

To be fair, some of the first books aren't as good as the next ones.. but they're all pretty good.

I'm actually surprised they decided to plan another release so quickly after The Last Jedi. &&And the Super Bowl is right around the corner so huge hype. By the end of the game you'll likely know more than you want too. &&Staying out of the way of TLJ and Black Panther I imagine.&&Well, it’s good that they added a subtitle to this film. Otherwise people would confuse it with my sextape. &&I know of movies that supposedly come out in wide release two months to this day with zero advertising.

A SW movie doesn't need heavy advertising but one like this definitely needs something. They should *pretend* like they have some confidence in this thing.
&&I’m pretty sure Ron Howard came out and said trailer will release soon but wanted to wait for buzz of the TLJ to die that way there wasn’t an overload. 

I’m personally ok with this as I hate getting 3 trailer 7 tv spots 12 behind the scenes. Give me one trailer 3 months before the movie releases that way shits not given away like in every other Disney movie ( marvel being the worse ) &&[deleted]&&It wasn't a fan made poster, its official and the one on all the leaked Lego set boxes. 

That being said, I figure the frenzy will begin late this week with toy previews, teasers, posters, etc.&&Nobody asked for this movie &&This soon?  I thought it was like December.&&When Ron Howard revealed the title, he revealed the logo effectively at the same time. I believe there is a teaser poster based on that art, and that is about it.

I expected them to release a teaser trailer a week or two after TLJ was released. I'm honestly surprised we don't have one yet.

I wonder if Lucasfilm is debating internally whether or not to delay the film at this point based on the footage they have.

It seems ridiculous to not have at least a teaser right now.&&There is a poster hanging up in a theater I frequent. &&Part of the appeal of Han Solo was the mystery of his origin. How he could always muster up a tall tale about some extreme feat he was undoubtedly exaggerating in hindsight. Solidifying his origin steals part of his appeal and taints his image moving forward. 

What I really want is a Darth Vader movie that isn't afraid of an R rating, depicting his struggles and conflicts with the dark side. (after the prequel trilogy up until Rogue One, possibly even mirroring events in Rogue One.)&&If this crashes and burns there is no one to blame but Disney upper management. &&Im surprised its not a christmas release like all the others&&Would love it if they go with Han Solo playing Denzel Washington’s role in Training Day. The witty suave guy who always has a slick response to everything and you never know when he’s telling you what you want to hear. Just a Disney version so no leaving Chewbacca to die in a Mexican Gang lords house or leaving Lando to die in a gang ruled neighborhood. &&All you need to know 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEd3DpH_e0&&There was that promo banner that leaked. And the Lego sets leaked too. But yeah, nothings dropped for it unfortunately. &&The reason is because they don't want to cannibalize the success and profits of Episode 8 and want to utilize their marketing budget effectively. I work in marketing in the film industry and there are a host of reasons for why marketing a movie may be delayed. In this case, the most likely explanation is that they were waiting to see when the fanfare for episode 8 was trending down, and then release movie posters for Han Solo movie. This would have the two fold effect of marketing for the Han Solo movie itself but also reinvigorating support for episode 8 since they are still in the same star wars universe. A delayed marketing approach for a movie is not usually not a sign of movie production running poorly or the expectation for a poor movie, especially for a movie this scale.&&I think it will bomb.

But they're most likely waiting for TLJ to leave theaters, or they'll push it back.&&The Solo movie was a bad idea and they know it.  They are just hoping that they can let it down easy.  I mean they just had the Last Jedi which it seems was all about forgetting the past and movie on from the OT and now they peddle a movie that NEEDS OT excitement LuL.&&I honestly don't think I'm going to see it unless the reviews come back and declare it a masterpiece. I've got Star Wars fatigue and The Last Jedi didn't leave a great taste in my mouth.&&> This isn’t normal right?

Normal for a movie with a smooth production cycle that will likely turn out to be a decent film?  No.  Normal for a movie that is a total train wreck of a production that will likely turn out to be a steaming pile?  Yup.&&Probably remaking the movie. Now with 3000% more jokes and quips&&I work at a movie theater and we have received posters of the movie weeks ago&&It’s too late to change gears now but I imagine that this’ll be the only time they do such a short gap between films. It makes properly promoting the film tricky. I mean it’s awesome we’re getting it in May still but it IS a bit soon after TLJ. Cross promotion is not easy without hurting either film. &&Am I the only person who enjoyed Rogue One? People making assumptions before they see anything about the movie. &&TLJ is still in theaters. It’s too early.&&Cause they know you fuckers will eat this shit up.&&I think it will be pushed to December, as usual&&That was the old deal. The new deal is 3 movies a year FOREVER. 

Pray they don't alter it further.&&The three Disney SW films so far have all been scheduled for May, and pushed back to December due to production delays. This will be the first one sticking to the original release date.&&They have upped production &&Yes the episodes, but then there are the spin offs: Hans Solo Spinoff, Boba Fett Spinoff, Obi Wan Kenobi Spinoff.....and so on&&I figured they were waiting for the Super Bowl.&&Is that the target demographic they are aiming for? 

Edit: Ok I get it, it's standard procedure for Disney, you can stop telling me that <_<&&This rumor changes depending on the day.&&Is there any source for this rumor? I'd love for it to be true, just haven't heard anything about it. &&TLJ on December 15. Black Panther in February. Solo in April. Infinity War in May. That's a lot of AAA Disney property to fit in 5 months.

Edit: I got mixed up: Infinity War first in early May and Solo 3 weeks later. &&After seeing so many marketing fuck ups for movies recently, it's good to see Disney not totally fucking this up.&&Trailer is supposed to drop on Friday: [https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/901814/Star-Wars-Han-Solo-movie-trailer-release-date-Ron-Howard-Good-Morning-America](https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/901814/Star-Wars-Han-Solo-movie-trailer-release-date-Ron-Howard-Good-Morning-America)&&Yes... I'm surprised they hadn't pushed it back more. Star wars will always make money but they're risking overload at this point&&I'm expecting a trailer with Black Panther.&&>I’d imagine they are just staying out of the way of TLJ. Once it’s Box Office has slowed I’d imagine we will start seeing stuff. 

Showing a teaser or a trailer *with* the Last Jedi would have been marketing synergy.

&&The Super Bowl is in about 4 weeks and I’d imagine that rather than release a trailer now and then get forgotten 3-4 weeks later they’d rather make a big splash during the SB. 

After all, Star Wars doesn’t really do that well in Asia, specifically China, and about 1/4 to ~~1/3~~ [edit: I’m being corrected that it’s not 3/9 but 4/9, my bad] of its total gross for both movies have come domestically, which is incredibly rare for today’s blockbusters. Only the biggest ones have that ratio. Most mid size blockbusters gross less than 1/4 domestically. 

I predict Solo’s trailer releasing during the SB. Go big or go home. Good or bad it will be the most talked about commercial, unless Avengers releases a 90 second trailer. &&Right.  I suspect they want star wars fans going to the current star wars movie, not thinking about the next one&&it just dropped 55% to third place this weekend&&I was expecting a Solo trailer in front of TLJ. &&that does seem like a huge misstep &&Except that “A New Hope” opened on May 25th...

So “May the 4th...” may be fun, but May 25th is still a big day for Star Wars. 

May 25th is really Star Wars day... from a certain point of view. &&Considering The Infinity War trailer got more views in one day than the Last Jedi trailer has total even with how huge the hype was for that movie, I think it's safe to say Disney is betting on Infinity War being the bigger of the two releases. It may be Star Wars, but Solo is a spin-off that no one asked for and not too many seem hyped for, while Avengers: Infinity War is a movie the MCU has been building towards for a decade.&&That's the same date the original Avengers was released&&Then they can blame Infinity War for Solo not performing well.  They need to have their excuses all lined up so they can explain why Solo is the lowest earning Star Wars movie of all time.&&Same here. Saw one at my local cinemark in roanoke TX. Was just a black space background with Solo in the middle.

Based on the stories of how much a clusterfuck its production has been?  Pretty damn bad.  Anything with that many problems with development does not usually turn out to be a thing of quality.  &&I think they're just steering clear of The Last Jedi. &&> Is it true they had to hire an acting coach for Alden Ehrenreich midway into production?

Why is this such a problem to so many people?

Loads of actors have coaches, especially vocal coaches when they're doing accents or acting as other people. Hell, Lebron James has a coach and trainers too.&&It won’t matter. If it’s pretty good, Disney does it again! If it’s pretty bad, geez fans can’t handle taking the 10th movie in a different direction, I thought it was amazing, it’s still Star Wars. &&I think it was the image from the Lego boxes that someone turned into a poster, not the actual poster itself&&We know, but don't worry we will give 9 of them. &&The only one it seems we want is a sweeping epic of ewan as obi wan in tattooine&&Why would they kill the hype of TLJ with Solo like that? I think it's pretty clear they want to ride the wave until it slows a bit (it should this week) and release a trailer (again, this week).
&&This guy frequents.&&Agreed, or a Darth Bane movie showing the origins of modern sith. Or Darth Plagueis. Any of those 3 movies would be a Star Wars movie like we've never seen if done correctly. Darth Bane's humble origins could actually get people rooting for a bad guy.&&> Solidifying his origin

Including an ""explanation"" for the Kessel Run units of measurement beyond bravado to strangers in a bar. Just as bad as Han Shot First! (OG EU's fault as well)&&If Han's appeal is mystery of his origin, then Vader appeal is every minute of his life documented and filmed? We already had 6-7 movies about him, observing his character from young age to brink of death. Come on, there is dozens of inhabited planets and millions of sentient creatures in Star Wars universe, yet you still want to look at Darth Vader :1&&Yeah I also agree that the people responsible for getting the movie made are responsible for how it turns out.&&It really does feel that they are being super greedy. So many movies being pushed out and quite possibly rushed. I disliked TLJ because of its pacing, scrambled plot, and  character arcs. These things could maybe have been addressed with some reshoots and better editing, instead they pressed 
ahead so as to not conflict with their other films. That or they have no clue what they are doing at this point.&&I'm actually still expecting it to be delayed.  With Avengers/Infinity War coming out as a major summer tent-pole, why not wait?&&Probably cause they figured their Mary Poppins movie would make more in December than the Solo film would given all the other action films coming out around it&&I don't think it will bomb. There are enough die hard fans that will see anything Star Wars no matter what it is. Then there are the fans like myself who are curious to see if it is a complete train wreck. It will more than likely perform decently but my guess is it will be the lowest earning of all the new Star Wars films so far.&&I'm showing up just for Dong Lover &&I see this a lot, but the point of the last Jedi was literally not to let the past die. Did you ignore the entire part where the villain was the one demanding the past die while the protagonist stuck with the resistance?

The message of the movie is decidedly not let the past die, the message of the movie is to learn from the past.&&Very reminiscent of how the Dark Tower was marketed, or wasn't, as it were. &&Because it had reshoots with a different director?

I love Star Wars, but having all these spinoff movies is going to burn me out, and hearing about the next trilogy on the way concerns me even more.

I have hope that everything will be fine, though.&&[This deal's getting worse all the time!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpE_xMRiCLE)&&The red flag with this movie is that its production delays have been bigger than any of the other three movies.

Then the year and a half until IX can act as a bit of a breather.&&>  Star wars will always make money but they're risking overload at this point

That's my problem; I'm ""Star Wars""'d out.  I need some down time.&&More like they're risking more only average quality.

Personally I think it will be shit, but that is based on my sour taste after TLJ, and the fact that I *hate* the idea of it. I absolutely 100% do not need to know the origin of Han Solo, quite the opposite. And that these types of production problems rarely lead to great movies(though it has happened). But. If they *have* an actual solid script, and if they indeed just reshot the entire fucking movie, basically starting over from scratch, then who knows?
  
It would just depend on how good the script was and if Ron Howard, a very talented director, can make a good movie out of it.

I'd like to see anyone just walk in and take up the reigns of Han Fucking Solo from Harrison Ford without any coaching.&&Hiring an acting coach before production isn't a big deal; hiring an acting coach midway through production because you're unhappy with the actor's performance is concerning.&&It was leaked before the Lego boxes.

You have casual movie fans who just simply say ""what is playing this week and do I want to see it"" and die-hard Star Wars fans who may be going to see TLJ for the fifth time because that is what they want to do.

Releasing a Solo teaser doesn't really affect either of those groups.

I saw a rumor that TLJ may get a BluRay release in March. If Disney did announce that today, it could convince people ""I shouldn't see TLJ today when I can just wait two months for the BluRay which is cheaper than $50 at the theater"". Announcing the BluRay release date now could kill the box office for TLJ.&&Yeah I am personally invested in the idea of a Noire style Star Wars film where the protagonist walks the line of what distinguishes good and bad in the Star Wars Universe. I would totally be okay with the franchise shinning light on the idea that the Jedi are also capable of being corrupt with ill-intentions. I think a good reference point for that type of story would be someone like Boba Fett that has dealings with both parties.&&Bomb in comparison to what the other films made.

TLJ is at around half of what TFA made, and a spin off film about Han Solo will most likely make much less than TLJ. 

I think hype was a huge factor to TFA as well as TLJ, and I see none of that with this movie.

It has a decent cast, I really enjoy Star Wars and I'm a fan of the series, but will probably wait to see it on bluray.&&> There are enough die hard fans that will see anything Star Wars no matter what it is. 

I'm hearing a different story from a lot of die hard fans after TLJ. Maybe Disney can replace those people with new fans but comparing TLJ numbers to TFA numbers it doesn't look like the franchise is gaining an audience.

Disney needs to do something fast before Star Wars is tainted as a ""sometimes they're good"" franchise. You can't put out a movie every year if the franchise has that kind of rep. The Marvel formula only works because people generally love the films.&&There are other adaptations than these, Sai&&They went out of there way to make sure it wasn't marketed.

So, check it out.  I discovered/was recruited into a Dark Tower alternate reality game a little over a year before the movie came out.  The thing gained a good amount of attention because people thought it was associated with the film, and Sony even went on to start a little viral marketing of their own that was modeled after the ARG we had started - same name and theme. 

Around October of 2016 the dude running the game said he got the cease and desist from Sony, and shut the game down.  After our game was done with, Sony proceeded to stop their viral marketing of the film.

Of course, the film turned out to be very bad, but they didn't have to ruin our fun because they knew they were making a bad film.&&I must have missed the part where Spielberg and Coppola were fired, or when Roy Scheider, Martin Sheen, and that kid had to take acting lessons mid-production on Jaws, E.T., and Apocalypse Now.&&Jaws didn't lose the director halfway through filming lol. &&I mean it's not really the same as Rogue One. With Solo, they fired the directors mid-production. These aren't just reshoots they're doing with Ron Howard. They weren't done with their main shooting when the original directors got fired. I agree though that we should wait till the film actually comes out to criticize it.&&wait, this isn't /r/starwars ?&&I think it might actually be my least favorite...&&Maybe it's a crossover.  Like Han Solo vs Mary Poppins.  One flies falcons the other flies umbrellas....&&If only they put the same amount of care and planning into a Star Wars episode as they do a BBC series. &&Shoot, I just wish the next series of Luther is more than two episodes.&&No way! It's *Star Wars*! STAR WARS STAR WARS STAR WARS! DAE STAR WARS?!&&I'm already done with the franchise(s) after Last Jedi. It's not even that I hated Last Jedi (I was disappointed, but it wasn't awful), it's just that there's nothing intriguing about Star Wars anymore. There are better IPs out there for me at least.&&Pfft. Look at all the Marvel and DC movies. Obviously people aren't tired of those so there's no reason for it to occur with star wars. As long as Disney starts moving away from the Skywalkers and their plight after episode 9 because honestly I've lost interest. Old republic? Yes please. What about stories of minor characters in clone wars? Republic Commando movies would be freaking awesome. &&Uh... it is hyperbole.  For the foreseeable future, there is one Star Wars movie for each year through 2020.  After that we don't know the plan.  Don't believe you read everything on the internet bruh.&&Already got me. Saw rogue one, was sad they changed so much, heard bad stuff about tlj and a new trilogy, and now I'm done with the franchise. Like, I dont care anymore, it's ruined for me. &&I'm confused- I thought they were doing Christmas movies alternating main plot episodes and side plots (EP VII, Rogue one, Ep VIII, Solo, etc) so the Han solo movie would be Christmas 2018?&&i will say since this movie is May 2018, and Episode IX is December 2019. That large gap will be nice to help build movie hype.&&As someone who watches and/or listens to all the major movie review sites -- these guys are all worried about this movie, for all of the reasons already mentioned in this thread (and the cherry on top is that they haven't done any marketing yet). 

The general consensus seems to be that the movie is either gonna be pushed back to December (which makes sense), or they're gonna release a trailer sometime this week on Good Morning America or some shit. IMO, they're not happy with the movie (or maybe the movie's fine, but they're not happy with how the production panned out). They could easily drop some money on a Super Bowl commercial (which might still happen), but it's now sounding like they're gonna drop it during a morning show -- likely just to appeal to the more ""general"" audience (which IMO means they're not very confident in the movie). 

Regardless, this has nothing to do with the release date being in May. May was the *original* planned release-date, because most Star Wars movies were summer releases to begin with. They *wanted* May to be the month, because *most* Star Wars movies were released in the summer, from the beginning of it. Star Wars literally created the ""summer blockbuster"" thing. 

Don't be worried about the time of year, be worried about the lack of marketing -- people keep mentioning that they're purposely trying to allow Last Jedi to stay in the limelight, but according to every movie guy I've heard from, that's not a thing that exists. People will still go to see Last Jedi regardless of whether or not a new Star Wars movie is announced. 

Not to mention, most movies make most of their money in the first 2-3 weeks either way, so it's stupid for anyone to argue that they're trying to give more exposure to Last Jedi. At this point, Last Jedi already got as much exposure as it's gonna get. 

Just go on youtube and listen to Collider Movie Talk, or John Campea, or Jeremy Jahns, or Screen Junkies, etc. They've all been saying the same things recently. They're starting to get worried now, and if we don't see a trailer some time this week, that just spells bad news for the movie in general. 

At the very least, the movie will get pushed back to December -- and generally, that's not a bad thing. It just means they need more time to make the movie great. But this is a different situation. There were director issues, actor issues, studio issues, etc. Ron Howard is now the director, and I've been rewatching the Andy Griffith Show recently (where Ron Howard is the kid on the show), and I believe in him as a director. 

But even if he's a great director, who's making the best of a bad situation, we can't expect him to be Superman and just re-create the entire movie. And IMO, the lack of marketing suggests that the studio still isn't very confident about it. 

&&The trick for this movie is to set your expectations so low that it can't possibly be worse than you're imagining... it's a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford. Doomed since the day somebody at Disney thought up this bad idea.

&&The original film (now Episode 4) basically pioneered the ""Memorial Day release"" that opened during a holiday weekend to add an extra day to the opening take.  Lucas always did this.

There’s like 3 of us!&&I'm going to try not to draw conclusions before seeing the movie, but I'm also not too thrilled about the idea of it. Having a ""young"" version of an incredibly iconic character that is only 29 seems a bit odd, especially when that character is tied so closely to the original actor's performance.&&You're right that it's hard to say at this point. Further muddying the waters, I think, is that Howard has a pretty inconsistent track record. He's made some classics (Apollo 13) and some mediocre blockbusters (the Da Vinci Code movies). So who the hell knows, lol.&&My excitement the extended universe spin-offs was killed a bit when I found out that two out of the three they had confirmed (the first being Rogue One) were just origin stories for original trilogy characters who really don’t need movies to explain their backstory to begin with.

Rogue One seemed like a perfect spin-off film, expanding on the original trilogy while trying to avoid covering familiar ground by making it an actual war movie. 

Solo and Kenobi don’t really sound like they’re intended to expand much of anything in the universe, save the actual characters of course. And I’m sure that they’ll be fine movies, but from the sound of them it’s like Disney’s just too afraid to take bigger risks with which ideas to greenlight.&&The fact that Kasdan worked on the script gives me hope for that. &&The filmmakers challenge is that character development can't do anything surprising. We know the character and who he is in later life. It's not like a villain or jaded character where their backstory is mysterious either. It's just going to be a movie that takes no risks, offers nothing deep, and a cast that will forever be in the shadow of the original actors. If you didn't like TLJ, then I think you can consider traditional star wars to be over. We're in the age of endless sequels, spin offs, and tv series now.&&[deleted]&&Wait what the fuck, do we even know her character’s name?&&Me personally, I can't wait for Chewbacca: A Star Wars story releasing in 2026 and of course its follow-up, Wicket: A Star Wars Story in 2027. The trilogy will then be concluded with Lobot: A Star Wars Story in 2028.&&Kyle Katarn would be a great story for a morally ambiguous and reluctant Force user. Doesn't have to be Valley of the Jedi but I'd watch the crap out of any IP with a Jedi Outcast theme.&&> Bomb in comparison to what the other films made.

It still wouldn't be a bomb. It does however have a likely chance of being a disappointment. Rogue One showed that the spin offs can reach a billion (regardless of the fact this movie had nostalgia, Vader etc it still showed that they can reach this high even though they aren't main saga movies), and with a presumably ballooned budget due to the lengthy reshoots i'd suspect anything below 600m would not only spell trouble for the brand but also probably stop it breaking even.

I suspect they'd be happy with anything around 700m considering all that happened behind the scenes. Not as big a success as their other movies but enough to stop it from being a complete failure. &&> Maybe Disney can replace those people with new fans but comparing TLJ numbers to TFA numbers it doesn't look like the franchise is gaining an audience.

To be fair, TFA's numbers are pretty much impossible to top. It rode a wave of ""first movie in new trilogy after franchise was dormant for 10 years."" TLJ was never going to touch TFA's box office numbers.

&&> Maybe Disney can replace those people with new fans but comparing TLJ numbers to TFA numbers it doesn't look like the franchise is gaining an audience.

TFA was the biggest domestic box office grosser of all time. There was no way its sequel would make more money, because TFA was in the unique situation of being the first sequel to the biggest franchise in the history of these tings, in thirty years, which would at last bring back long-yearned for characters. The sequel, by definition, would not have the pent-up yearning, nor the novelty. Even if that wasn't the case, the biggest grossers of all time are in a rarefied field of their own, so it's very difficult to compare them to other films. When Avatar 2 comes out it will definitely not make as much money as the first but as long as it makes more than a billion around the globe it will probably be considered succesful, even though that would be a fifty percent drop. &&[deleted]&&But Marvel seems to be the very definition of “sometimes they’re good”. I don’t think many would argue that Iron man 2, Thor 2, The Incredible Hulk or even Age of Ultron were particularly good movies. &&Well, Harvey Keitel was fired after shooting began and replaced with Martin Sheen. I know the point you are trying to make, but Apocalypse Now is a terrible film to make it with, because it was a film with huge problems, was endlessly delayed, had major issues with their cast, particularly Brando, and that everyone predicted would be a critical and box office disaster, but actually turned out to be a critical darling and made its money back.

Marketing for a different era.

Source: The Making of Star Wars by JW Rinzler&&Considering that they took a traditionally weak month for box office and turned it into a machine that prints money, I don't know why they keep trying for the May release at all. Star Wars in December has proven pretty nice the last three years, it's timed well for Christmas toy sales and they don't step on the toes of their own spring and summer blockbusters. The constant scheduling for May is weird. Actually sticking to it this time is weirder. &&If I remember correctly, all of the Disney-era Star Wars movies were supposed to be released in May of there respective release years.  JJ decided to rewrite Ep VII, and wanted it pushed back a full year (from May 2015 to May 2016).  Disney said they wanted the movie released in 2015, so they pushed it back to December of that year.

At that point, all the other movies were still scheduled for May releases (if memory serves me right).  I suppose a sort of domino effect, and reshoots for Rogue One, pushed RO and TLJ to December, leaving Solo and Ep IX in May.

[Ep IX was still supposed to be released in May of 2019, until this past September when they switched directors.](http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-episode-9-release-date-change/)

This left Solo as the only movie to remain as a May release.&&> I don't know why Disney/Abrams decided to shift to a pre-Christmas release

The movie was delayed because the original writer was fired and JJ needed more time to write a new screenplay.&&Memorial day is important if you're producing toy lines.. It's a holiday that isn't religious so people don't congregate in the house.. And is at the tail end of the school year so they can market test which Roys are getting produced for christmas&&The Star Wars 'crowd' will show up no matter what month. Are you really suggesting the Star Wars brand isn't strong enough for summer? That's crazy and totally ignores the fact that all the Star Wars movies released in summer until TFA. &&Agreed.  Releasing it as far from IW as possible would be the best option, IMO.  Maybe they just think that SW will be a hit no matter what. 

Honestly, if I had to choose between Infinity War and Solo....I choose IW 10 times out of 10.&&It's coming out 3 weeks after Infinity Wars, though. Honestly, I think Deadpool (coming out the week after) is a bigger threat. But overall 2018's summer schedule is nowhere near as crowded as 2017's.&&I actually saw Wing Commander in theaters. I don't even remember what it was about, it was so terrible.

I think that's one of my biggest fears of the movie, Ford is so closely linked to Solo that any actor isn't there to play Han Solo, he's there to play Harrison Ford playing Han Solo. Anything other than Ford's mannerisms will just feel [odd](https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8efgpFAgW1qbymseo3_500.gif) on the character.&&Thank you so much!!! My sentiments *exactly*.

I for one am excited for *Emilia Clarke: A Star Wars Story*

(He's joking, btw, there's no talk of a spin-off movie about Emilia Clarke's character)&&Rogue one did so well because it tied into the main series much more than this is going to. 

It was a direct prequel that connected to Episode 4. 

Solo takes place much earlier. 

To see a a movie apart of the main series, The Last Jedi earn just over a billion (will probably end around 40% less than TFA) is huge, which is showing that the hype for the Star Wars movies is dying down, which is why I think it will not do well. &&Hell my love for Star Wars was born from the prequels, while my father’s died from taking me to see them. Kids are going to defend the sequel trilogy the way I defend the prequels now. It’s kind of amazing to watch myself become more like my dad.&&EXACTLY. I can’t stand how people put SW on a pedestal.

It’s going to do fine even the movie is subpar. &&Rogue One was also “in turmoil” and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  I have faith in this one. &&If that's true, it's a shame. I'm actually excited for this movie. Hesitant about a new actor in Han's shoes but otherwise excited to see our first glimpse at a universe halfway between prequel and OT, directed by Ron Howard.. seems like if it turns out right it could be an unexpected surprise, then again it could end up being a dark spot for SW that no one talks about.&&You’re a towel!&&This guy is quite the hoopy frood.&&[haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT9jryF7wPc)&&I personally love that the X-Men have had their own little universe. So much of what makes that world great to me is how the world reacts to mutants, and how important this change is to the day-to-day lives of people.

I just don't think that in the MCU, after New York has been invaded by aliens(twice) and then saved by a giant green monster, the norse god of thunder, and a super soldier from WWII that was frozen in ice, that mutants showing up would be as big of a deal. Like, your kid would start to show signs of super powers, and you'd be like ""Oh, like Spiderman, or Hulk, or Captain America, or the Scarlet Witch?""

EDIT: I guess what I'm getting at is that my primary complaint about the MCU is that it's never taken its own premise seriously. There's hints and nods(like [the Korean Church of Asgard](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Korean_Church_of_Asgard)), but overall, the world in the MCU feels very much like ours, the New York in Daredevil seems like our New York, not a New York that was invaded by Aliens a decade ago. The world in the Fox X-Men universe always felt like a world where humanity was dealing with this gigantic change, in how humans view ourselves, in how humans view mutants, how it'd change our psyche. It was able to do this because the only thing going on in those movies was mutants. You can create a world where one huge thing happens, but you can't maintain a world where 12 huge, completely different things happen. &&> With streaming there’s an entire crowd of people that will almost never buy a movie ticket again

*Nobody* knows anything about it besides that, not just the casuals. We know it's a Han Solo origin story, and the cast, of whom we only have a few even with their roles confirmed.

I think that it would be more interesting for them to do an independent Star Wars film set in the old republic or some other area of the universe not related to the main Trilogy. &&Can't wait for the arrested development style narration! I can hear it now...

Sounds like kind of a mess if true but at least they realize they have to redo it and get it right when dealing with this kind of franchise&&It occurs to me that I have no idea who is playing Han. I'm excited about the new Lando, and that will bring me into the theatre regardless of who else is cast.&&A less charismatic clone.&&Inhuman stigma, Mutant stigma, but individual accidental powers? Heroes.

I want to see a superhero be accused of being a Mutant or Inhuman, and at a press conference he denies it in no uncertain terms, followed by, ""uh, not that there's anything wrong with that,"" like Seinfeld.&&> At a point the line between mutant and regular old superhuman breaks down, but they still try to treat them differently.

It's almost like racism doesn't make sense.&&Oh, they'd certainly just reboot the whole thing. I'm really very confident that Dark Phoenix will be the last of the Fox X-Men universe. 

I'd bet that Deadpool just keeps doing Deadpool movies, but there will be nods to being in the MCU now. Then they introduce the Fantastic 4 in the MCU, and then maybe long term they do X-Men after all of the current Avengers cast has aged out.&&In almost any other movie, that would be a testament to good character writing (i.e. He's not the Native American character, he's the character who happens to also be Native American), but in SS, it's probably due to lazy writing, since they didn't even bother with the ""character"" part.&&Because his ethnicity didn't really matter.

So it actually makes sense that he did choose Memorial Day intentionally.&&[deleted]&&I WENT TO SEE IT OPENING NIGHT!! IM STILL HERE! WHAT YEAR IS IT?&&And this is what gets me. I love Han Solo, but I like him because he's a character that gets into and out of situations with his wits (and not space magic). He also adds depth to the Star Wars universe by interacting with the criminal element, something that wouldn't be touched on otherwise.

But all executives will take from a failing Solo movie is ""people don't care about smugglers, they want to see Jedi.""&&> You’ll never be able to repeat the magic that Harrison Ford had, which sets up the film for disaster. 

There's also an additional small problem of having NO STORY. There is no storytelling reason for this movie to be made - even less than Rogue One. Han's character arc begins with him being a callous in-it-for-the-money smuggler and his character develops after he meets Luke, meets OBW and learns about the Force, sees Alderaan blown up, and meets Leia, all of which results in him coming back at the end of the movie to save his friends and join their future adventures. What the fuck is this pre-Tatooine movie going to be about? Han is a flat character before Tatooine. The whole point is the plot of ANH gives him an arc.

But Disney doesn't think like that, it's just ""X is a known IP, we paid four billion dollars to acquire X, make a movie about X. Fly my lovelies!"" Like putting AT-ATs on Scarif. The only reason they're there is because some Disney exec has a spreadsheet that calculates how many toys, vidyagames and toaster ovens they had to make out of each piece of the IP and those poor AT-ATs weren't pulling their weight.

**EDIT:** to everyone who's saying ***""I'd like to see his days at the Imperial Academy!""*** and ***""What about his first time smuggling for Jabba!""*** and ***""You could make a story about how he rescued Chewie!""*** you people are part of the problem I'm afraid. A story is not just a list of things that happen. Even if those things are cool. ""Cinematic Universe"" filmmaking has blinded people to this. A story is a cause and effect structure (like the Every Day Until structure popularized by Pixar but that's just one model) that moves a character through a progression or arc that is about something more than just overcoming some physical challenge. &&Good thing that's exactly what we're getting after Episode IX&&Solo has been little more than fan service in the last few films, IDK why they'd make a movie solely about him.&&Han: It’s not my fault!

On top of that Han Solo isn't exactly presented as a particularly upstanding individual at the beginning of A New Hope. It's going to be weird if they make him a ""hero"" here and IMO it would undermine his character. 

If they were absolutely set on telling a story in that time frame of the Star Wars universe using the same elements, I think they would have fared much better making a Lando or Boba Fett movie and having young Han make an appearance as a supporting character (since Han was a smuggler, it wouldn't be particularly unusual to have him work with Boba Fett in a sideplot in a prequel standalone Boba movie).  Hell, Billy Dee Williams has said he wanted to be in the new Star Wars trilogy so they could have easily given him Holdo's spot in Episode 8 so that he has some spotlight and then he'd be well known for a spinoff film. &&I don’t think it would be completely unreasonable for Han to have started out as the character we see at the end of ANH. A story where he gets broken down, showing the cause for his callous in-it-for-the-money attitude, could be interesting. A there and back again sort of deal. 

The problem is that such a movie would have to end on a down note. Not something I suspect is attractive to Disney. &&What's the problem with AT-ATs on scarif?&&Inverted heroes arc. He starts out a little naive and altruistic. Over the course of the film, he learns to become more selfish.

It's cold, but the mentor gives him the tragically proud ""the student becomes the master"" look as he accepts his fate.&&Why is AT-ATs on Scarif so bad?

"Natalie Portman, at 13, experienced 'sexual terrorism'",37604,7rtu27,http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/us/women-march-natalie-portman-trnd/index.html,6452,1516489339.0,,"Here's pretty common to talk about how hot underage Lindsay Lohan use to looked, and then bash her about aging or drug abuse&&I don't know if this is common in other countries but we do this a lot to adolescent girls in media: movies, tv, music in the United States. Joke about them being jailbait, fetishizing them sexually. It must be a deeply weird experience to grow up with that kind of twisted public attention.&&Growing up and seeing how britney spears was portrayed at 16 was pretty disgusting, also I think they had her on talk shows talking about her virginity and stuff. Its super fucking weird. I heard the girl who plays Eleven from stranger things was put on a list of sexiest women, wtf.

Another thing that's fucked up with hollywood is how girls in their 20s maybe even 30s can play young college freshmen or high school aged girls. It really fucks up perspective of children when they are portrayed as sexy and really young in media. But they are actually fully matured women.&&A lot of people are saying this happened because she was put into this particular role. But Emma Watson wasn't in adult roles in the beginning, and neither was Miley Cyrus. Can we move past that point please.&&It’s terrible how young actresses are sexualizrd and treated. Mara Wilson wrote an article recently, I can’t remember for what site, but it was about how magazines were calling the girl from Stranger Things “all grown up” because she was thirteen now. Mara shared experiences how she’d get letters from perverts when she was a preteen. &&> ""A countdown was started on my local radio show to my 18th birthday -- euphemistically the date that I would be legal to sleep with,"" she said.          

That’s so gross&&I think everything that needs to be said has been said regarding the main point of this article.  Portman deserves praise for being honest and open about her own personal experiences as a child actor, though ""we shouldn't sexualize children"" is sort of an obvious sentiment and no one who is doing it is actually working under the delusion that it's acceptable behavior.  It's more that they just think they can get away with it.  I also agree with the posts bringing up Portman's enormous hypocrisy in complaining about the sexualization of children, while having actively and openly supported an admitted child rapist; as well as those criticizing her hyperbolic use of the word ""terrorism"".

But since this is a subreddit for movies, I actually thought this was an interesting part of the article that no one is talking about:

>Portman said she adjusted her behavior, rejected roles with kissing scenes and emphasized her ""bookish and serious"" side. She built a reputation as a ""prudish, conservative, nerdy, serious"" young woman in order to feel her body was safe and her voice heard.

A lot of discussion has been had about why Portman's career never really took off like it should have.  Audiences loved The Professional and were amazed at how good she was both in the film and the press tour surrounding it, but this brought the expectation that she would gravitate towards similarly controversial and challenging roles in the future.  Instead most of the projects she picked as a teen and a young adult were pure schlock, and the speculation has always ranged from her agent simply being terrible to the Star Wars prequels having completely tarnished her image as a competent actor.  But this article paints a different picture and seems to suggest she eschewed challenging, meaty roles in favor of prioritizing projects that made her feel ""comfortable"" and apparently emphasized her ""bookish"" side.  It makes you wonder what her career would have been like if sexual harassment hadn't influenced her decisions.  &&> ""A countdown was started on my local radio show to my 18th birthday -- euphemistically the date that I would be legal to sleep with,"" she said. ""**Movie reviewers talked about my budding breasts in reviews.** I understood very quickly, even as a 13-year-old, that if I were to express myself sexually I would feel unsafe and that men would feel entitled to discuss and objectify my body to my great discomfort.""

That's fucked up.&&American culture is so *bizarre* with child actresses. Pedophilia is vilified and demonized to hell and back, yet I totally remember tons actresses having countdowns to legality. Britney Spears was the most popular one from when I was younger. And then it became Emma Watson. It was essentially gross adults admitting that they were sexually attracted to these kids, but having a small disclaimer at the end. &&Stories like this make me really nervous for the cast of stranger things, especially 11 (don't know names).


The industry tries to make these child stars appear as adults in what I can only assume is a disgusting attempt to attract adults (wallets) to said child stars.


Kids need alot of protection in the entertainment industry, from both the fans and the industry alike. &&The only people I thought that society did this to were the Olsen twins. 

Think about for a second: the kids who got their start as babies playing the same infant, then starring in a bunch of kids videos growing up. 

There was a countdown for them too. 

It’s a miracle Portman turned out sane at all.&&I think pedophilia is much more common than I thought it was.  2 middle aged women at work were discussing very casually how they'd like to teach some fun things to a young male actor.  I think he is 11 or 12.  I called them out on how gross that was and they berated me because it was different for women and men.  I imagine I would be fired if I was discussing an 11 year old girl the same way at work in front of them.&&probably parents should be filtering letters from strangers at that age.&&I sympathise with the shit she had to go through growing up, but how am I supposed to reconcile that with her signing the fucking Polanski petition?&&N A T A L i E

I didn't even know about the countdowns and the fact that it doesn't surprise me to hear about them, as well as Natalie's experience is just...surreal. We have a lot of work to do. 

And the teen portrayals on TV are a problem, too. Aside from being bizarre, the way it distorts our view of how we should look or dress at that age is unhealthy. There's no way that it doesn't negatively affect children and adolescents in some way. &&amanda bynes, man...poor kid.&&> Another thing that's fucked up with hollywood is how girls in their 20s maybe even 30s can play young college freshmen or high school aged girls

Even when they hit teenaged years and all the other movies and shows about girls that age had actresses in their twenties starting, the Olsens were relatable.

Some people are disgusting.&&Also, nobody experiences this kind of thing because of who they are, or anything they did. The choice to sexualize a child always lies with the adult.

She said

>""I remember on my 18th birthday I came out of my birthday party and photographers laid down on the pavement and took photographs up my skirt, which were then published on the front of the English tabloid [newspapers] the next morning. 

>If they had published the photographs 24 hours earlier they would have been illegal, but because I had just turned 18 they were legal""&&>Portman remembered turning 12 on the set of ""The Professional."" It was her first film....
A year later, when the movie was released, she opened her first fan letter. It was a ""rape fantasy"" from a man.

I think the whole quote makes it much worse. &&There was a similar thing happened to Charlotte Church - who was 15 at the time.

Come to think of it, ""sleep with"" is a euphemism. &&They did that to Emma Watson where I'm from, she was a little over 16 and they talked about the countdown on a couple different stations, a rap/hip hop station and some rock station. I was shocked they were allowed to talk about shit like that on the air and not get fired. It was pretty disgusting behavior by dudes in their late 20s and and into their 30s.&&I’m fairly certain the s*n had a countdown till Charlotte Church turned 16. &&That kinda thing happened a lot in the 90s. The Olsen Twins were often talked about. Yeah, creeps would talk about it like they were going to have a chance to legally sleep with whoever,  but I think a lot of it was due to Playboy Magazine and their ability to get celebrities on the covers. So Celebrity X just turned 18. Maybe we'll get to see them naked.&&You make some interesting points but I find it odd that you don't think her career took off. Two years after The Professional she did movies with Tim Burton and Woody Allen. A few years after that she was in The Phantom Menace. I understand after the fact people didn't like the Star Wars prequels, but at the time getting that role was a big fucking deal. If that isn't her career taking off I don't know what is.&&Yeah, I found that part interesting too. It's not just that the sexual harassment made Portman uncomfortable (which would absolutely be enough for it to be a problem), but that it has concrete ramifications--in this case, for her career. But that also made me think about the other kinds of costs this pervasive childhood harassment has. If Portman felt the need to cover up her body and not explore anything sexual on the screen, what are the chances she felt similarly in her personal life? There's a very clear connection between being sexually harassed as a child and thus being unable to explore your own sexuality in a safe way and thus becoming an adult without the tools to say ""This is what I want; this is what I don't want."" We talk a lot about enthusiastic consent and the need for women to be able to own their sexualities, but that's hard when you've been raised in a culture that teaches you that you have to protect yourself from predators from the time you turn 12 (or, for many of us, younger.)&&Are you aware that Natalie Portman won best actress for Black Swan right?

Lots of my favorites on there :-( disgusting &&Isn't this the sub halfway up Meryl Streep's ass when she applauded Polanski and called Weinstein a god despite knowledge of his activities? &&Yeah but that was before it was politically and professionally expedient to be against sexual assault &&(CNN)Natalie Portman said experiencing ""sexual terrorism"" at the age of 13 made her feel the need to cover her body and inhibit expression.

The award-winning actress shared her traumatic experience Saturday while addressing a crowd of thousands gathered in downtown Los Angeles for the Women's March.


Portman remembered turning 12 on the set of ""Léon: The Professional."" It was her first film. She played a young girl who befriended a hit man in hopes of avenging the murder of her parents, she said.

A year later, when the movie was released, she opened her first fan letter. It was a ""rape fantasy"" from a man.

""A countdown was started on my local radio show to my 18th birthday -- euphemistically the date that I would be legal to sleep with,"" she said. ""Movie reviewers talked about my budding breasts in reviews. I understood very quickly, even as a 13-year-old, that if I were to express myself sexually I would feel unsafe and that men would feel entitled to discuss and objectify my body to my great discomfort.""

Portman said she adjusted her behavior, rejected roles with kissing scenes and emphasized her ""bookish and serious"" side. She built a reputation as a ""prudish, conservative, nerdy, serious"" young woman in order to feel her body was safe and her voice heard.

""At 13 years old, the message from our culture was clear to me,"" she said. ""I felt the need to cover my body and to inhibit my expression and my work in order to send my own message to the world that I'm someone worthy of safety and respect. The response to my expression, from small comments about my body to more threatening deliberate statements, served to control my behavior through an environment of sexual terrorism.

&&I think about this a lot. I grew up on the internet and I was younger or the same age as many of these child actresses. 

I would see people commenting on them being hot/attractive and I agreed, thinking little of it. Some comments were crass but it was the internet and no filter jokes were common.

It was only later I realized that, without realizing it, I kind of assumed every commenter was my age too. They obviously weren't though; even now I often catch myself reading comments as if they're from someone in their late 20s when I'm often probably talking to 14 year olds and 50 year olds in the same topic.

Olsen Twins countdown seemed funny to me but I was younger than they were. I think anonymity is important on the Internet but it has a side effect of normalizing many things, age disparity being a big one. &&TBH 11 year old me thought she was the shit&&But people eat that shit up. 

What’s interesting to me is that some celebrities look really good out of character, and nobody ever says: hey, she seems very pleasant and attractive in her sweats. &&I didn’t realize they were so young when they started out. I loved tATu. &&They were that young? That's so scary and weird. &&It doesn’t make it particularly less creepy but the girls in British tabloids have to be 18 not 16. I don’t think they would get away with doing it in the current climate, ie post Saville! &&And, they were marketed as lesbians, when they weren't. &&Damn I remember TATU. Flashbacks lol&&Yeah, their producer Ivan Shopalov or something like that, is a sick fuck. One of their music videos is pretty much just a close up of Yulia's face while she masturbates until orgasm. She's like 15 in the video. He literally told her to record herself while doing it and then to give him the video.&&It still does, r/starlets is basically r/jailbait just without jailbait in the title. I found out about it on one of the ""most disturbing subreddits"" askredit posts&&>  starting to happen to adolescent boys too

There were tons of middle-aged women getting the hots for Taylor Lautner and Justin Beiber when both were like 16.&&It’s not ‘starting’ to happen. It always has. 

Edit: fixed typo&&That is what makes it so urgent we deal with this.  It shouldn't be a norm to sexualise children.  Full stop.&&I always assumed they use young 20s actors for high school roles due to child labor laws &&One night I was bored and I looked up the ages of the cast of Friends when the first season aired. All mid-to-early 20s if I remember correctly. I compared that to the cast of Friday Night Lights (playing high schoolers). Mid to late 20s. One may have even been 30. Kinda shocking. &&The complex it creates for older women too, because they can be expected to look like young chicks if some women do it.&&There’s child labor laws that actors under 18 can’t work over a certain number of hours so studios hire older actors to act as teens. &&Oh thank god. That would be pretty fucked up for a 13 year old to be on a list of sexiest women. &&TBH they should have rethought that headline if they're going include minors.&&I hope this is true. Anyone got a source on this?

I won't be surprised if this specific controversy turns out to be a total misunderstanding because people cba considering context, it happens all the time (like the 'coolest monkey in the jungle' thing). &&That's not true. It comes from the August 2017 issue of W magazine, an English language fashion magazine and the cover title of the article is ""Why TV is Sexier Than Ever"" and features a list of attractive actors and actresses, including the 13-year-old girl who plays Eleven in Stranger Things.  

http://www.hawtcelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/charlize-theron-in-w-magazine-august-2017_1.jpg&&It also makes them think constantly about what they're not doing. South Park did an amazing episode on this&&It also contextualizes sex as a dirty thing, which surely screwed up their perception of sex even beyond their passage into legal majority.&&Joe Jonas had a great AMA and talked about it. &&I remember the huge international creep festival when the Olsen twins were turning 18.&&When I was a teenager, I remember reading a bunch of ""when these girls turn 18"" comments.

Now, discuss the Olsens or Lohan and grown men twice their age act as if they are disgusting.&&There was an actual sketch on MadTV about the Olsen Twins turning 18&&I remember laughing at the website dedicated to the Olsen twin's countdown to legal age... *shudder*&&Hey there, the article is talking about Natalie Portman and her experience in Leon the Professional. But yes, the sexualization of the young actress in Stranger Things also helps prove my point that it doesn't matter the role these young actresses are in, people are sexualizing them regardless. And it sucks, and it's incredibly sad. But those comments now seem to be pretty down voted so that's good.&&This wasn't really the thesis of her article, but it's a thought that stood out to me when I first read this many months ago and it's stayed with me:

> But the media has become democratized; social media and user-generated content mean anyone can write about anyone, and there is a good chance anyone will see it. **We are all part of the media, but I don’t know if we’ve realized that yet, nor understood what a tremendous responsibility that is.**

Kind of profound. We think about the sort of ethics we'd like to have in journalism, but don't apply the same standards to what we post on facebook and reddit. Maybe we should be.&&And also Cracked&&yeah, me too. My dad was having some of his friends over when I went to give him a kiss goodnight (like I always did), wearing my pyjamas. One of his friends commented that I had little boobs and had started to look like a woman, and wanted me to come give him a kiss too. I was a kid. I think there was some shocked reactions, and I was immediately send upstairs. Somehow I thought it was my fault, and oh the SHAME I felt for the longest time! I stopped kissing my dad goodbye and definitely started to be conscious of my body in a bad way. :(&&I was 11 when a group of strange older men groped me in public&&There was a study done and 12 was the mean age where girls first started noticing men looking at them sexually. &&Yep, I was 13 when it first happened to me. This was about the mid 90s. 

On a trip with my mom and we were walking through the hotel lobby in the evening. Some older men, maybe late 30's or early 40's watched me and one had the gall to follow us and knock on our hotel door to ask if I could come out and hang with them. 

I can't recall everything my mother said, but I do recall her ending the rant with she's only 13 and shutting the door in his face.

Pretty scary to think that if he really wanted to ""hang"" he could've made it happen. :-/&&8-10. Wtf. That's not even teens. Wouldn't even call that preteen. What's attractive about a child? &&My daughter got cat called by a man driving in a neighborhood when she was 12. She said she and her friend got freaked out by it and ran down a few streets and through some yards to put some distance between themselves and the guy in the car. &&Exactly! I was hanging at a friend's house one night when I was in middle school and I walked home by myself. I live in a city but there wasn't really many people around. A guy maybe in his 20s, 30s started walking alongside me and kept asking me all these questions about myself. I don't know why but I started crying and he said he would leave me alone. I had to run into a convenience store to calm down before I ran home. 

Later in life I felt bad like why did I have to be so weird, it was just some guy talking to me. But even later in life I'm like damn, I was freaking 12! I should not feel guilty about it because why was some grown man talking to a 12 year old girl?! And this was before cell phones and I was freaking 12 without any self-defense training so I felt pretty helpless and my body told me that by crying. &&Same here. I remember being 11 when a man told me it was time to buy a bra (my boobs were coming in but they were barely anything yet). When I was 13 a highschool teacher used to stand behind me ""to check if I was doing it right"" but in reality he was trying to look down my shirt. I wore turtlenecks to his class afterwards. 

Throughout my teens and early 20's I've had men who could have been my dad say they wouldn't kick me outta bed. It's really creepy and I gather it will only stop when I'm no longer considered young and attractive. When I was 28 a 60-year-old colleague started behaving really creepily towards me. After telling him to back off several times it took HR to actually make him listen. They didn't fire him though and I still have to deal with him every day. 

These experiences have made me very wary towards men in general, which sucks because I know there are good ones out there, but it's like walking up to grizzly bears and hope you don't get mauled. &&Yep it sucks. My dads friend grabbed my ass when I was 12, never told anyone just tried to convince myself his hand slipped or something &&Yep. The comments started for me around age 11. Then it progressed and I was assaulted for the first time at 13.

Gone through similar incidents/general bullshit for 2 decades. Most recent incident was a man grabbing me about 3 months ago. &&I had a man (mid-20's) say something to my (at the time)11 year old daughter. She got away, grabbed a hammer to protect herself, ran to me and told me what happened and I confronted the guy, I blocked the exit and he couldn't leave the store and the cops were called-levels of confrontation. 

As she gets older, I wonder how that fucking interaction with that idiot will limit her. She is overly cautious either me or my wife are out of view. I want her to travel the world, like we both did, like my sisters did and her grandparents did. &&Yep was 16 when I threatened to beat up an  old creep who was making inappropriate comments about my sister and her friend who where 11.&&Yup agreed - happened to me and my friends on a daily basis, multiple times a day since we were 15. Started when I was 13.

Me and my friends have also talked about how we got the most attention when we were under 18, dropped off slightly until 21 before declining sharply each year. 

I imagine a lot of it is predatory behaviour towards young girls who don't see how creepy or dangerous it is and yes the sexualisation of underage girls. 

My legal studies teacher in class would discuss the looks of high school girls in class repeatedly to the point where it was creepy - in hindsight, worth flagging, but when you're young you don't see how inappropriate it is.&&I first got cat-called when I was 11 years old. I was tall for my age and in a B-cup and they were far away on a roof (repairing it). So I'm hoping they didn't realize I was a child. Because that is extra weird if a group of men were intentionally cat calling a child.&&They're already sexualizing her.  There was talk in some magazine recently about how she's all gown up with some comments on her figure.  I mean she's barely a goddamn teenager yet. &&So, I do Lighting for Special Events. Concerts, parties, award shows. One of the big gigs I did recently was the arrivals for the Emmys, the Red Carpet. Part of my job is to make sure that everything power and lighting wise is perfect during the gig. So I have to be on the carpet. When the boys showed up they came as a pack. You can tell they’re all friends IRL and ran up and down playing around and saying “let’s go over here! Let’s talk to them!” And having a good time.  They were the bell of the ball this year, *everyone* wanted to talk to the Stranger Things kids. Then Millie showed up, I think with her mom, but when she hit the carpet her mom (maybe agent?) stepped aside and let her start the interviews alone. Now, this is really how it always goes with celebrities that bring their fam/friends that aren’t famous - no one wants them in the shot. But the look on her face when she was left alone to these screaming TV hosts broke my heart. I realized looking at her that this was just some 12 year old girl that was *completely* anonymous 2 years ago. Just *2 years ago*. Let THAT sink in. Now she’s having to go on live TV by herself on the carpet. I’m sure she did just fine, but myself having a 14 year old sister it really made me sad for what kid celebrities have to go through. Especially since the boys seem to have each other to lean on and she did the whole thing alone.

Edit: So I know this will look like I’m part of the problem (sharing this here) and to an extent I guess I am. But when you’re on the carpet you’re only thinking “oh cool it’s Eleven!” It wasn’t until I put my phone down and really looked that I saw a 12 year old girl that seemed shocked, alone, and kinda scared. But I actually have a picture of what [fame can look like for a young person.](https://imgur.com/a/lLCyL) I think this kind of thing is important: to remember that they’re just people like us and for some they’re very young people. At 12 I was worried about my art class grade and when to kiss my girlfriend for the first time not what to say on National TV.&&I feel sorry for Millie Bobby Brown. She is really talented but she has a crazy stage dad. He made bad press a couple years ago demanding $100,000 from an agency just for signing her (that's not how it works), apparently he gets ""final say"" on every outfit she wears, the family basically spent all their money for the sake of helping her career... Makes you think the girl must be under a lot of awful pressure. I hope she has adults in her life looking out for her best interests.&&Yeah it’s sad how they don’t let her be a kid. In the magazines I’ve seen her in they always put her in dramatic makeup and clothing. It’s weird. I feel bad for her.&&Hell, what about Jodie Foster and Brooke Shields playing child prostitutes in deeply sexualised and violent films when they were actual children?&&Scared for? It's already happening. It's already happened. That's not something to be scared about, it's something to be angry about.&&On a related note, I've been seeing a lot of stuff on Twitter about romance drama between Millie Bobby Brown and Jacob Sartorius, and whenever I see it, all I can think is: ""Aren't they like 14? This is weird.""

EDIT: Jacob, not Jason&&True, wasn't there a pic on Reddit a few weeks back showing a tweet someone posted about how He makes her feel horny? He was rocking this white t-shirt in a 50's Mick Jagger / Bob Dylan look&&The really frustrating part, as a father, is you'll start to notice how almost every compliment -- sexual or otherwise -- will be somehow framed in the context of her looks.

Just look at a random facebook post with her in it (whenever she starts) and everyone, friends and family, will probably default to ""she looks so great"" even if it's a picture of her doing math of singing or playing chess or playing a video game or whatever.

Always about the looks.&&your daughter will begin experiencing harrasment from men in a few years. it IS scary. what you can do is help her be ready for it (the best that she can) and ... i don't know, start changing the world as fast as you can.&&A stranger first decided it was okay to touch my stomach just above my waistband when I was 12. *TWELVE*. Came up behind me and had his hand on me before I knew what was happening. Watch her like a hawk at least until she turns 16.&&I think when you reach the point where you're laying down on the pavement, waiting for the opportunity to take an upskirt of a just-barely legal young woman, which you'll later sell to a tabloid for the world to see, you should probably start questioning the choices you've made in life.&&I remember when people online were posting “1 more month” captioned images of Emma online.&&Ricky Gervais's speech in extras comes to mind: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1P7ncmRGo&&The whole countdown to 18 thing happened with the Olsen twins too.&&[deleted]&&I remember being downvoted to hell a while back for suggesting someone was being creepy that they felt it was okay to masturbate to under age Emma Watson photos because ""she's 18 now"".&&I feel like they’re currently doing this with Millie-Bobby. It’s so gross.&&Also for what a healthy attitude that film has towards men and teenage girls, like Leon's not seeking out teenagers to hang out with it's forced on him, Mathilda is this boisterous girl on her way to becoming an adult, she emulates adult symbols including women, including sex, even trying to seduce Leon at one point, which Leon is flattered by to an extent and even slightly conflicted because he's this lonely guy for whom Mathilda is filling many roles in his lives.
 
She's like a little sister/daughter all wrapped up into one and he has adult heartstrings to tug on in regards to intimacy and sex, and Mathilda unknowingly/unmeaningly tugs on those trying to be flirtatious, but he recognizes that such a relationship would be wrong and she is just a girl, not a fully grown woman both in the sense of body and mind to be capable of informed consent.

The film shows this all naturally and free of judgement, Leon and Mathilda are great at representing base human desires as well as the pressures of society on Mathilda's end, and besides the multiple revenge killings and possible other casualties, they were a pretty truthful commentary in a positive way, which makes it worse in the sense that a lot of men blew straight past the character lesson in Leon to wanting to fuck a child.&&>I think the whole quote makes it much worse. 

Nah.  Portman's words don't really do justice to just how disgusting the Natalie Portman / grits memes and whatnot were.  Check out Slashdot posts from 10-15 years ago.&&[This page](http://www.anorak.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/charlotte-church.jpg) from the Daily Star shows the hypocrisy of the tabloids in this regard.

One or both have gone through eating disorder rehab, and gotten lots of advice about what not to do from an older pair of model twins, the Barbi twins, who made about every mistake and only recovered by a hair.&&Hell even some parts of Reddit this year.&&Not necessarily Reddit specifically, but I remember the Ariel Winter ones (the nerdy sister on Modern Family for those who don't know). I remember seeing countdowns mentioned when she was in her early teens. How can you be a grown person and not have the realization that the shit you're doing is disgusting?&&This is the same kind of thing happening to the kids from Stranger Things and Game of Thrones, it’s just so seedy&&When 500 Days of Summer came out, an ex made an off hand comment about her and it just didn't sit well with me. She was 11 in that film. Making sexualized comments about an 11 year old is so wrong. It just stuck with me and one of those red flag things in hindsight. &&Don't forget that [this SNL skit](http://imdb.com/title/tt0694856/) about Emma's, uh... growth spurt... Was aired when Watson was 14, and was played by a 17 year old Lindsay Lohan.&&The country lost their minds for a 16-year-old Britney Spears in a sexy schoolgirl outfit, tells you all you need to know about how much more open we were about the creepiness back then.&&[deleted]&&Shout out to the daily mail for vilifying a paedophile in a main article while frothing at the mouth over photos of an ""all grown up"" 13 year old girl in a sidebar article&&I was a year or two younger than them when the films came out and obviously as a young teenaged boy after a couple of the films I went straight to the internet to sin my soul out over Emma Watson and I just now remembered I found photos of some naked woman with Emma Watson's head badly photoshopped on top.

It's quite gross and inappropriate, in my opinion.&&>Acknowledge that what happened to her was fucked up, but also still be open to criticize her. 

Perfectly stated. It's not a black-and-white issue. Just because she has a contradictory stance on Polanski, doesn't invalidate her experiences.&&Pretty much in support of Polanski.

People love to see an actor looking terrible and they love to see that same actor looking great a year later. The problem is that the *stressed out sad picture while eating a hot dog on a bench* pic and the *happy picture at the beach with the family* pic could be taken 2 days apart. It just depends on weather, circumstance, how much they've slept, and a lot of other things we all deal with daily.&&I didn't realize they were fake.&&Also I read about the 'groupies' in 70s rock.

This should probably be next.&&Plenty of subs about individual underage famous girls too.&&Idunno man, those are mostly promo shots of celebs, mostly clothed.

Every kid you had a crush on when you were a kid had a bunch of adults lusting after them too. 

This world has always been sick.

Grown adult eople that follow celebs have some mental issues man&&I always assumed it was because kids are terrible actors &&It's that and SAG rules. Minors can't work after 10, or before 530.

They can only work 4-6 hours most days (less for preschool age).  On weekends they can work 2 extra hours a day.

This doesn't always mesh well with the rest of production. &&Didn't they have an episode where some of them turned 30 and were freaking out that they were old? Last movie I saw with Jennifer Aniston was We're the Millers and she's being a MILF/stripper.&&When Buffy the Vampire Slayer came out, the youngest cast member was Sarah Michelle Gellar at 20.

Like what the fuck.&&""Hey now, don't be so quick to judge.""

- lots of old directors in Hollywood, apparently&&I was going to say. South Park covered child stars fucking perfectly.&&The Olsen twins were smart to get out. They said they felt like ""little performer monkeys"" and didn't want to do it anymore. I wonder if it's because they had each other, whereas other child stars might only be surrounded by adults who want to profit off them, or other kids in the same spot.

I wish Lindsey Lohan and her twin could've helped each other that way.&&I'm sure it's mentioned somewhere in this thread, but there was literally a website devoted to counting down the exact date the Olson twins turned 18.

And some of my dickhead friends at the time played into it. Yeah. Fucking people, man. &&I remember a website that counted down the minutes until the Olsen twins were legal to fuck, a few years before they turned 18. That website wasn't coded by a minor.&&I actually made a comment relating to this the other day.  

Where does the onus lie for fact checking and does one party have more responsibility than the other?  Does it lie with the sharer of information or the receiver?   We've all seen posts about how people need to be better at critical thinking and fact checking for themselves, but not as many faulting the sharer of information.   Also how do you hold those accountable that share bad information, especially when you have people that will still read and believe information from that source regardless of their credibility?  

A lot of this comes down to personal accountability, taking pride in your trustworthiness and other virtues.   I believe I heard this on NPR (i could be mixing it up though), but it was something to the tune of virtues are no longer valued in society as they once were.  

It's definetly an interesting topic to explore and there are no easy answers.

I was at his house about to leave. In the basement. When the dad came downstairs and told me he bet my dad didn't hug me enough and he was sure I could use a hug. I was like no thanks. I told my dad and was forbidden from ever going there again and they haven't hung out since. They still live mere blocks from each other and it's been like 30 years. Eventually my dad told this really gross story about said friend bragging about having sex with a 13 year old in the neighborhood in the 70's. Just incredibly disgusting stuff.

Then a man in his 30s whistled at me and I suddenly felt dirty and BAD and scared.  I'll never forget that first time of understanding that I was in potential real danger for just being female. And of course after that the education, so to speak, continued, but I think I will be 90 and still remember that feeling. That guy started the indoctrination of making me aware that I had to be wary of men at all times.&&As a complete stranger, for what it’s worth, I hope you’re doing okay. :)&&I literally googled her name because I don't watch stranger things, and the top 3 news stories are about who she's dating, and that she looks like natalie portman.

what the fuck is wrong with people obsessing over celebrities?&&It's really gross.  All you have to do is look at Game of Thones / Maisie Williams & Sophie Turner.  People were sexualizing them long before they hit 18.  Maisie was 11, and Sophie 12 when they started shooting.  Both started getting sexualized by fans at minimum by season 3 (14 and 15).  Especially after Maisie's boobs started showing.

Now both are ""legal"" and it's ""not a big deal"", but given that neither have a sexual role in the show (literally the only sex either have is when (**SPOILERS**) ^^^one ^^^of ^^^them ^^^is ^^^raped ).

But anyone who followed the show could see that the sexualization of her happened long before they were of age.

-----

To use another example, that girl from Kick Ass whose name I can't remember right now was all over Reddit and other sites long before she was of age as well.  People were literally counting down the days until she were ""legal"".  

I'll finish the post how I started it: It's really gross. &&[removed]&&> Especially since the boys seem to have each other to lean on and she did the whole thing alone.

This is intentional. Millie's parents are the puppet masters behind how she is portrayed, it's not her own choice. &&And you just know that the plan for her to arrive separately from the boys was set up purely for publicity and exposure. She was just as much friends with the boys as they are with each other. Man, let them all be kids and all hang out together. Why separate her from the boys for the sake of extra glamour shots.&&I have a 13 year old, nearly 14, daughter. We can't believe how old they dress millie up. Stacked heels and tiny, tight clothes. Thing is my daughter kinda wants to dress like that but also KNOWS it's inappropriate for her age. I wonder how millie feels about it? The UK papers have played it that the parents moved to the US because that's what millie wanted, reading the comments here, I'm not as sure. I'm not a fan of Emma Watson but whoever chaperoned her through fame kept it real. You would never have taken her for more than a dressed up teen. Plus, as you say, no one seems to expect the boys in the show to be more than the kids they are. It's scary. &&On beyond stranger things she talks about Winona taking her under her wing/being close with her so there's some hope at least&&I hope an agent or someone puts her money someplace her folks cant touch it before its too late.&&[deleted]&&That can go in either direction, though. You can get the crazy stage dad who would literally pimp out his daughter, or the crazy stage dad who will literally kill anyone who touches her and watches her like a hawk.

The latter isn't exactly healthy, I'm not saying that, but it's better than the way a lot of child stars get treated. &&It's weird because at least how she started out in the show, she came across as an extremely nonsexualized, tomboy type girl. Why the fuck would they sexualize her in all the promo material and magazines? That doesn't even fit the character, let alone how fucked up it is considering the actor's age.&&I didnt know who she is, but looking at pictures they dress her up like she is 30. She looks old af&&Yeah it’s one thing for two sixteen year olds to date, who cares. But for them to be a celebrity couple... people need to chill with that shit. Can you imagine if people were watching your every move interacting with your girlfriend at 16???&&i thought you were suggesting a romance between thirteen-year-old child actor Millie Bobby Brown and the late, legendary jazz bassist Jacob Pastorius at first, and it confused the heck out of me &&Not directly that he made her horny. It was a 26-28 year old model who said “Not to be weird but hit me up in four years.” 

Actually, now that I say that, you are probably right and there are just multiple instances of people creeping on him. &&Geez. What's wrong with people.&&I think this is an underrated one as far as problems go, and once you’re aware then you become hyper aware of any time you do it or others do it. It’s everywhere.&&As a non-celeb status female, harassment from total strangers started with me at age 11. I recently found out that shit is actually common, and harassment for a lot of girls starts at 11-12. &&[deleted]&&At that point I think you're just waiting for a millionaire star to get fed up and lash out at you.  Cue major lawsuit and you finally quitting that awful job as you whistle your way to the bank.&&[removed]&&>You open the paper and you see a picture of Lindsay Lohan getting out of a car and the headline is, “Cover up Lindsay we can see your knickers.” Of course you can see her knickers, your photographer is lying in the road pointing his camera up her dress to see her knickers. You’re literally the gutter press.

>-Andy Millman&&That was a really good scene.  I've never watched the show, and i have no idea what the context was but holy shit did Ricky Gervais move me right there.&&Remember /r/jailbait and the furor when it was banned? It’s a little ironic that reddit is now so sanctimonious.&&[deleted]&&It's happened to like every single under-age female actress. 

I remember when Reddit first started Emma Watson was still underage (like 17 or so) and it was a common topic on Reddit, regarding people waiting for her to turn 18. 

It's happening to the male kids too, Stranger Things kids are getting perved on by milfs 

EDIT: People pick weird topics to play devil's advocate on.&&The same sick shit is happening with Finn Wolfhard too. Women (and let’s face it, probably men too) on Tumblr have obsessive posts about him and countdowns to to his 18th birthday. These are grown ass adults *fantasizing sexually about a child* and it gets laughed off. It’s horrific.

“Sexual terrorism” is an apt term.&&I saw a mexican twitter news outlet calling her ""sexy"". What the fuck...&&I completely agree that the film that ended up being released is great and turned out exactly how you just described with nothing wrong with it, but people who look at the film negatively because of a sense of child sexualization aren’t totally wrong, the creator did have a thing for it. Luc Besson originally included this in the script and it was thankfully removed but it should’ve never been written in the first place https://i.imgur.com/izGrzd2.jpg

And although it was legal in France, Luc Besson (who was in his 30s) did have sex with a 15 year-old girl after marrying her at that age. He then included her during that same time in Leon: The Professional. She then had his kid a year later at the age of 16. He then left her for Milla Jovovich during the making of The Fifth Element who was like 20/21 at the time. 

So regardless of the final product of the film, people aren’t wrong when they say they get a serious sense of something taboo happening on screen during some scenes, because no doubt it was written and directed by someone living in a culture where that sort of thing isn’t illegal or looked down upon. Thankfully the final film goes more for the father/daughter angle instead of something disgusting&&Doesn't help that the director was dating a 15 year old at the time of making Leon....&&I was a kid when it came out (she's actually older than me, who knew?) and I felt awkward watching that film. 

If little kid me could understand that this relationship is stressful for them both and he is purposefully struggling to not sexualize that girl, I don't understand how grown adults couldnt.  &&> Check out Slashdot posts from 10-15 years ago.

Them turning 18 was pretty much national news. &&Yeah, I can't believe Rolling Stone got the secret files of Abu Ghraib&&[deleted]&&Yeah the fangirling over the Stranger Things kids is just weird.

It's ridiculous. Like they think it's a big game of tag and the cops broke the rules by catching someone during a time out.&&About how the rapist and disgusting waste of skin Roman Polanski should be able to get away with his fucked up crime because he made ""The Pianist"" or whatever the fuck.

I would say it's the exact opposite of weird, i.e. normal.&&And one of them is an outspoken homophobe.&&There was a group called ""baby groupies"" (yeah) girls from age 12 to 16.

The moment starlets does that, it will be gone for good. 

I don't know if it still exists, but when I joined the website I saw people mention something like /r/PrettyDeadGirls or similar being allowed for months 

ps:I didn't remember the particular sub name and I didn't wish to search for it either, but it's been mentioned below me now. &&It was far worse than that. The reason it got banned was because it became public that they were using the subreddit as a means for pedophiles to distribute and trade actual kiddie porn. Chances are one of those bikini pictures was part of a....set. &&[removed]&&I always assumed Americans grow up really fast&&The kids in stranger things are brilliant actors, but then again you might be right and they could just be the exception &&It's also due to labor laws (restricted hours) and on set education requirements for young actors. You certainly can use child actors, but its much easier to just get a young looking 18+ person&&I have a friend in the industry who used to make his living by essentially looking underaged after he turned 18. He even tailored his work outs to maintain a boyish appearance. He did a bunch of murder documentary reenactments, commercials, extra work, etc. Essentially he said it’s because he could do the whole shoot in a single day, where as an actual minor would take 2 or 3 days to do the same amount of work. &&Yeah that was an episode. If it makes you feel better, Matt LeBlanc had to dye his hair for almost the entirety of his time on Friends. 


And yes, Jennifer Aniston is still gorgeous. &&David was supposed to be playing 25 but the rest of them 16…  And Charisma’s transition to Angel the series made for some gross stuff with young Connor.&&The hispanic mom and daughter duo in Orange is the new black is just a few years apart. Being cast as the “old” mother must feel horrible. 

Edit: it’s two years. &&I just watched ""I, Tonya"" tonight (great film) but in it, Margot Robbie (27) plays 15 year old Tonya Harding. And her boyfriend who was supposed to be about the same age was played by Sebastian Stan (35). It wasn't overly creepy or anything, and they mostly play adults in the film, but I remember thinking, they look nothing like the ages they are supposed to portray.&&This is why Superbad to me is the realest high school movie. Shit like American Pie where you got ~20 year olds always seemed off&&Oh I definitely agree there. I was simply saying that in *that* particular case it wasn’t a sexual thing. I definitely agree that it’s super gross what the media as a whole does to young actresses like her. &&> South Park covered child stars fucking perfectly.

Phrasing?&&> I wish Lindsey Lohan and her twin could've helped each other that way. 

I guess since they lived in different countries it wasn’t that easy to support each other. &&fucking eww&&Me too. I was so into cracked at one point, not missing any new post even started remembering favorite writer names.  
Then one day it snapped, just left browsing the website and never looked back. Strange.

*To add a little, they used to be my perfect escape during teenage years. Plenty of categories to browse, funny captions, plus the titles and stories felt like a better version of buzzfeed. &&He might have after I was send upstairs (for my own safety, I see now). I remember feeling upset and shamed, so there might have been some arguing or tension after that, that I don't remember clearly anymore. Unfortunately my parents never mentioned it again, and I internalized it as my own fault for a long time.&&If you want a shit answer from someone who failed A level psychology (this is just one thing I remember), basically your brain dumps famous people who you either  see a lot of or enjoy into the ""friend"" part of the brain.

So basically people will assosiate those people as a friend (and the crazy ones might end up going a step further), this leads them to talk about them and judge them in a way as if they knew them. So folks can write articles about how these people look, act etc and create some drama for clickbait and such.

I uhh, guess even 13 year olds get dragged into the shit show as well now, which is sad.&&I always find it weird when people ""count down"" the years until a child star becomed ""legal"". It's not any less predatory to essentially wait for a minor to turn 18 than it would be if you creeped on them as a minor. &&Fuck dude, I remember the countdowns to the Olsen twins turning eighteen.

And look at them now - - they pretty much exclusively wear designs from the Miss Havisham collection, and I don't fucking blame them one bit. &&> that girl from Kick Ass

Chloe Grace Moretz. She also was in a movie called Hick that was creepy as fuck.&&> Maisie was 11, and Sophie 12

Wow I didn't know they were so close age wise. I thought Sophie was like 3 or 4 years older than Maisie.&&Then it would be ""world's sexiest girl"", let that disgusting shit sink in real quick.&&To be fair it was a “Hollywood’s Hottest” list. And by “hot” they meant popular, not sexually attractive. &&I think there was a story a year or so ago about Millie's father being really demanding, or something to do with her father and her management.&&Actually at least 15% of her money is put aside for her automatically. It’s in an account for when she turns 18 and her parents can’t touch it. It’s called the Coogan Act and it was put into place for this very reason. &&That's literally the same as the whole ""countdown to 18"" thing in the post.

It's no different to when guys say it to girls.&&Oh God, yeah the one i am thinking about there was a person responding saying that if he said that about Millie people would be jumping all over him.&&Yeah not to be negative, but I think I noticed men being creepy sometime around 10-12. It’s definitely a thing. Once I was 14 it was out of control. Then it’s just outright blatant creeping. &&I remember trick or treating as a witch when I had just turned 13 a few weeks prior,and my outfit involved a (high-neckline and knee-length, for what it matters!) black dress. The first house my friends and I knocked on the door of, some maybe 60-something Dad answered, looked at me and said “You must be the treat!” I distinctly remember the look on my friend’s face of “....uh what the fuck?”

And that was the first time I was aware of being sexually harassed.&&Same. I was getting sexual comments from strangers when the most important thing to me was my Lion King swag. 

It's a problem. A horrible, life shattering problem. &&yeah, i was lucky in that regard and didn't get boobies for a few years past that. I mean, i definitely was harrassed by men and boys before i had actual breasts (damn that's depressing) but i'm sure others had to deal with far worse/it beginning earlier.&&Alec Baldwin took some shit for punching out that paparazzo that one time, but, man, I don't blame him. &&Hopefully that whistle is from their over-extended asshole&&>Taking upskirts pictures of any woman, without her consent should be a criminal offence.

I know! I thought they were??&&The problem is that if you are a celebrity, people consider you THEIR property, and you have no right to privacy. Not too much you can do against them unless they specifically enter your own property without permission. But if you are in public, they think they own you.&&It's a great show, similar to The Office (UK). Only 2 short seasons, each episode has a different guest star. It's about small-time actors trying to make a breakthrough (extras) and it's very funny. This is the climax of the finale, so it's a pretty big spoiler. But it's absolutely still worth the watch.&&i wholeheartedly recommend the show 'Extras'.  Ricky and his pals are 'extras'  in movies & TV, and its funny and touching watching them navigate the ego crushing realities of showbiz. 10/10. &&In Foster's case, there's an emphasis on the terrorism from her stalker&&In Brooke's case to an extent her parents were asleep at the wheel. She was overtly sexualized in films and magazines from a very young age and her parents should have never allowed it to happen. &&Mary Kate and Ashly were the girls it happened to when I was growing up&&Chloe Moretz, too.&&It started when Emma Watson was 14. I remember opening a newspaper to see a double page spread dedicated entirely to her, with photos of her Just hanging out with some friends and playing about, with a headline along the lines of ‘Emma Watson is blossoming into a beauty’. The article was just obsessed with how her body was developing, coached  with the thinnest veneer of decency while the author, a grown fucking man, spent 2 pages on how attractive he found this 14 year old girl. 

It’s sick. The Objectification of women starts as children. 

&&There's a great interview in which Daniel Radcliffe calls out an entertainment reporter on this double standard, you can probably find it on YouTube. 

IIRC, the reporter said something about DR being an unlikely choice for a romantic lead, and DR asked why. The reporter sort of fumbles and says something about it might be awkward to sexualise someone associated with a child character or something, and without missing a beat, DR says 'No one's had any problems sexualising Emma Watson since before she was an adult' or something to that effect. It was cool to see. &&When Reddit started there was literally a sub dedicated to jailbait. The first time Reddit was talked about on mainstream media was when Anderson Cooper realized there was borderline kiddie porn on the site. &&>It's happening to the male kids too, Stranger Things kids are getting perved on by ~~milfs~~ pedophiles. 
  
FTFY

&&Also when she was even younger, on 4chan and other sites.&&What's real fucked up, too, is that reddit seems to often get mad at Emma Watson now that she's an adult with opinions and stuff.  &&Don't forget Chloe Grace Moretz, I knew people who had her birthday memorized so they'd know when she turned 18 it was so gross &&I can understand people being attracted to underage girls. It's not like a switch flips on your 18th birthday, you look essentially the same as you did 6 months before. 

You can't control what you find attractive, but dear god have enough intelligence and self control to just shut up about it and not be creepy.&&He complained last year that people keep calling him daddy on Twitter. &&I follow Millie on Instagram.

But I’m sure they’re not that creeped out by 14 year old girls who fangirl over them, it’s only super creepy when its adults but children will of course have celebrity crushes too. &&I think I read somewhere that the creators said to Sophie Turner that they didn't want her to do a naked scene because they know her since she was a kid.&&So did I. I looked it up and it was may 1st, 2004. Two months before she turned 18. The concept that puberty would affect a bunch of young kids the live across the hall from each other is funny but the focus on an actual person that is only 14 is a little much.&&[deleted]&&That was the issue that became infamous because on the opposite page there’s an article complaining about the the Brass Eye“Paedogeddon” TV show.&&And PoLanski&&> safe space.

From justice? They are probably right.&&He's given so much leeway because of what happened to Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson family.  This is total bullshit.

If you do, take a look at yourself. &&Oh yeah, that's pretty bad. &&Oh absolutely, I was just shocked at those two ‘friendly’ and beloved faces showing up. &&Seriously. 

Maybe people should complain about Hollywood sexualizing kids on-screen (and apparently off-screen, top).  Nothing wrong with a teenager being attracted to another teenager. &&I wonder why&&Julia is just an enormous asshole in general.  You could see it in their early interview clips.  After tatu broke up her asshole-ishness grew wings as she badmouthed everyone she used to work with.  She's since had plastic surgery and looks like a Ghost in the Shell robot.  
Lena, the redhead, is still singing and seems like a genuinely kind person.  Being paired with Julia for those years, nevermind having to kiss her, must have been torture.&&It was pretty much common place. Elvis met Priscilla when she was 14 and he was a decade older. 

27 year old Steven Tyler had a 14 year old groupie girlfriend and he even convinced her parents to sign over guardianship to him so that they could live together. He got her pregnant, pressured her to get an abortion(she did), and then broke up with her.  

Ted Nugent also sought guardianship over a 16 year old. 

The Rolling Stones talked about underage girls in “stray cat blues”

David Bowie has a history of this shit too, with one of the same 14 y/o groupies Page “kidnapped and had sex with”. 

Prince had a 15 y/o live-in girlfriend

I’m sure there are more that didn’t get as much attention. Like the Eagles’ drummer that got a slap on the wrist for his 16 year old girlfriend overdosing on coke and luudes. 

&&I never even heard of that. What the fuck...&&I love how honest and aware your comment is. We are only a decent step past chimpanzees. People tend to ignore that. That doesn't mean we should just accept savagery, but that we aren't ""broken"" because of these feelings. It's natural, but we've determined it's also harmful, so we need to be aware to make positive changes. &&Attraction is natural. You can't help it.

Acting on it is lack of self-restraint, which is almost completely controllable.
&&It's completely accurate as far as im concerned. Attraction for a physically mature individual is not an illness from a biological standpoint. The more interesting question is how to define and respond to those who do not have a line drawn even at the puberty threshold. &&Yeah. Me too.

Until I got older&&They are definitely an exception. Acting is a skill just like all professions and you improve with experience. The younger you are, the lesser potential experience you have for anything.

The other kid from the same show (Mike I think) was pretty heavily sexualised, along the lines of ""the hot mysterious boy next door"" or ""Call me in 5 years, cutie"" or some shit like that.

Pretty sickening all around. I get nostalgia and I get people identifying with the kind of childish romance as it's portrayed in the show because it reminds them of their own first crushes, but it's just fucking creepy to project any of that onto the real-life actors.&&It didn’t help how the parents pretty much ripped them apart and isolated them from each other.&&Same here!

And later when her body started to develop, they did a good job covering up her changes with costume design.  It wasn't really until after she was an adult that they allowed her curves to be seen on screen.  They wanted her to look as much like the rugged-tomboy she was playing as possible. 

Meanwhile Sansa was playing the role of the pretty sister who was destined for marriage, so they had her dress and makeup reflect that.  

Made the girls age-gap seem a lot wider. &&They're close to each other, but they were a little older than that.

When I remembered it as an adult it hit me how fucking gross it was to count down the age when you can creep on them and not be a pedo. 

We all wonder why they’re so weird now and totally ignore the fact that 16 year old girls were being sexualized by a bunch of creepy ass adults who made an entire webpage dedicated to counting down their legal age of consent. &&i remember them hosting SNL, and the in the closing credits one htem shouted out ""4 weeks 'til we're LEGAL!! GOODNIGHT!""&&There was a bit on SNL with kid rock and he was reciting a joke about it and he thought it was wrong at the time.&&Which they did from when they were like 8.&&I remember this awful shirt about them. https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5e/79/86/5e79863c42716b5660186b8f8edb4bcc--the-olsen-olsen-twins.jpg&&I remember people half jokingly say that if you add their ages together, it'd be legit.

&&Chloe was at a film screening I was at during a film festival one year. Afterwards, crowds were gathering outside the back doors waiting for her and Eddie Redmayne (who was also in the movie, pre-Oscar). I remember very distinctly noticing that she was not signing any autographs for men who it look like all had Hit Girl 8x10s, she was avoiding all of them. She was only taking pictures with and signing for young girls. Probably safe to assume this is why. It was really fucking creepy to see 20s/30s/middle-aged men creeping on her trying to get her attention. This was in September 2011, she was like 14 at the time.&&Maisie Williams too (Arya Stark in Game of Thrones)&&I remember seeing a YouTube video of an interview for kickass around the time it came out and everyone in the comments was talking about how she had great dick sucking lips. I know its just YouTube but honestly it's still weird when the internet gets attracted to random underaged celebrities.&&didnt she have some creep from right here on reddit stalking her when she was like 16 or so? i remember some post on the old cringe sub of some greasy looking 30something yr old dude taking a pic with her saying he waited for hours to see her and the poor girl looked so damn uncomfortable &&I always hear the word ""blossoming"" as basically a euphemism for girls going through puberty and I find it so unsettling and gross.

It sounds like someone saying ""look this one's almost ready.""&&I had a crush on Emma Watson the whole time, but we're like, you know, the same age. &&God, that jogged a memory of listening to the radio around when Prisoner of Azkaban came out, hearing them talk about how the movie makers tried to hide her breasts with that pink hoodie, but how they could still tell she was developing. It was just unnecessary and clearly made an impact on my 12-year-old self since I can still remember that.&&It’s especially perverse because those articles go through multiple layers of oversight with each of them saying “yeah this is cool to publish.”

Regardless of whether those managers are themselves OK with it or are just OK with selling it to the market that is, it’s fucking disgusting. &&Man, everything I've seen from that guy is top-notch.

>According to Parker’s relatives, in the span of 14 months, the high school junior underwent a staggering metamorphosis from a young girl with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations into a truly stunning commodity.&&It's almost assuredly because she's not the ""cool girl"" they had envisioned her to be when she became an adult.  *Now she's legal AND she's an advocate for impoverished women?  Pack it up, boys.  NEXT!*&&It works both ways. You can creep out 19 yo girl as easy as 16 yo, they will not start appreciate creepy behaviour because they turned 18&&Also, there were millions of boys under 18 who had the hots for all of these teen girls. 

Women and men are sexually attracted to each other. Get over it, and don’t be creepy or go out of your way as an adult to point it out. &&And it isn't just bad because it's gross and wrong (thought it is); it's also just poorly written. *Very* poorly, to be completely honest. &&I think the other reason it was pulled is because the original script called for a 15 or 16 year old and the actress they ended up getting was 12; so it was harder to go the original direction of the script.  There's actually a scene that was cut for the american version as 
 of the film as well.&&And she had a bunch of stalkers too. It was so bad that, when she wanted to buy a house with her Harry Potter money, she bought it anonymously so people wouldn't know where she lives. The only way to do that is to create a corporation that you own anonymously and use the corporation to buy it. Unfortunately the UK doesn't allow you to do that, so she opened a pass through entity in Panama for the sole purpose of anonymously buying a house. When the panama papers were released she was slandered in the media despite not evading a dime of taxes just because she owned a corporation in Panama. &&Hold my decency, i'm going in.&&It gets really fucking weird when people ""ship"" the actual actors and get very, very aggressive if it's suggested at all that these kids have lives that don't revolve around their on screen characters.

I've seen shit in the stranger things subreddit where people talk about Wolfhard and Brown like they're IRL soulmates, and it's a forgone conclusion that they ""want to be together"". It's like these crazy bastards are wanting to impose their own fucked up feelings on these kids, and they don't understand that they have no horse in this race.&&Did he say that on Guest Grumps or am I misremembering?&&Some would say, yes&&Because of all the things she said running through her head &&Because it's mandatory in Russia?&&[deleted]&&Also, some directors are better than others at getting a good performance out of their actors.&&> Acting is a skill just like all professions and you improve with experience.

The next year, Coogan's mother remarried and his fortune was gone. His step father and mother had spent his entire earnings except for $250,000. Coogan, after legal fees ended up with about half of what was left. So, a little over 4% of a conservative estimate of his total earnings.

Coogan's mother and step father spent approximately $53-71 million in 2018 dollars.&&I used to think it was so creepy that some dudes were actually counting the days down until the Olsen Twins became 18. There was a fuckin website for it, I believe.&&Reddit is just as fucking bad.

Half this website was counting down to Emma Watson being ""legal"".&&The Olsen twins thing was super creepy, but so many guys didn't see it.&&Dude my gf is 5ft and before we were dating there would be guys at bars (when we were out in our friend group) who would be convinced/excited that she was actually underage.

I can almost understand it if it’s young teenagers (like 13 or 14) because “shipping” culture is so prominent with characters in fandom and they may not realize it’s weird to do it with actual people.

It was the sort of item I’d have expected out of a great regional magazine, like Texas Monthly or The New Yorker and it made me see the site as “real” and not just a time sink hole. 

And then there was the one about why poor people are so bad with money. That stung like fire ants. The part about knowing that if you don’t spend that bonus/tax refund/extra money now on something you want, you have to spend it on something that sucks (medical, mechanical and so on) hit me hard. My husband and I have been like that for ages, even during times of plenty.

It’s sort of disturbing how many kids shows include sexualized young women. Even once they’re 18+ they’re still playing high school girls.

And even super safe Disney shows have WAY too many young women in short shorts, skirts and skin tight outfits. And naturally, said girls are always skinny and would be good looking if they weren’t, you know, are or are playing a 16 year old.

All the moments randomly focused on feet - so many of them that you know someone involved definitely has a foot fetish. Dan even asked fans of one his shows to write something on the soles of their feet and tweet in the photos. Cue 1000s of pictures of tween feet sent to Schneider.

Schneider used to provide bonus online content where he challenged the kids to do stuff. One had two guys and a girl 'making a sandwich' on another girl's stomach which entailed splodging all sorts of condiments and food items on her midriff as she lay on a table.

Rebooting instead of making a sequel usually guarantees a mediocre film. If a reboot is deemed viable, it's because the original was really good, which makes watching the reboot really just an exercise in comparing the new version to the classic people love.

Take Willy Wonka. The original is extremely dated for a multitude of reasons, but the core of the film's success was Gene Wilder who keeps the film watched today. Johnny Depp is loved, and his version got good reviews, but the original remains the superior work.

Depp would have been much better used for a fim of the second book, The Great Glass Elevator, because that story is far more dark and weird and right up Depp's / Burton's / Elfman's alley. And then they could have done a speculative third film based on Dahl's unfinished third book.&&Bring back so-crates!!&&I JUST found out Alex Winter is English.

As of the end of Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, their characters are essentially not the ones we've been watching throughout the course of the movies. They're older, wiser, know how to play music properly, and well on their way to changing the world as we know it, and have a baby each.

I like that each film has a different kind of theme, so I like to think a 3rd movie would follow a different theme.

1st -  Time travel  
2nd - Afterlife  
3rd - Alternate realities maybe? Other worlds?  

I do hope they bring the grim reaper back for it.&&Nothing like the prospect of 50 year old Bill and Ted to remind you that you're getting old.&&I can't fucking wait for full grown keanu reeves to say ""excellent!""&&Sincerely looking forward to it.&&Excellent!&&I'll never forget getting a free copy of Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey from Pizza Hut when I was a kid. It felt like fate. Movies were a big deal to me back then, and here was one, *for free?* I watched it so many times my parents tried to talk to me about not being a ""burnout"" like Bill and Ted when I was like 10 or 11 but I was way more into the universe jumping, mindfuck of a plot than the stoner humor, which is why I don't find Excellent Adventure as good of a film.

Both of them stand out to me, though, as some of the earlier forays into ""stoner comedy"" but both of them managed to kind of rise above that I think by introducing sci-fi and fantasy elements in a legitimate attempt to tell a story rather than as simply a vehicle for lazy jokes, and the humorous but arguably Utopian and egalitarian society built by following the logical extension of Bill and Ted's stoner/slacker ideology is both hilarious and thought provoking, and ""Be Excellent to Each Other"" as the new golden rule is genius.

I hope this movie is good because I'll probably see it regardless. It really shouldn't be good but the others shouldn't have been either - and maybe they weren't - but they've inexplicably left an impression on me for most of my life so I hope whatever magic that was is in there at least.&&I'm a history TA that teaches college freshmen and I told them to be excellent to each other in class, then proceeded to demand the source of that quote.

Fucking lol.&&This is So-crates...Johnson&&I wasn’t sure about this, but in the article they state that they genuinely like the movie and it’s not just a cash grab.

Story time.

A few years ago, my kids were at primary school, (elementary school) and one day they were telling me about a couple of hilarious class clowns named Bill and Ted.

""Hold on"" I said. ""Who are Bill and Ted?""

""Oh. They're brothers. And they're really funny.""

""They're brothers?""

""Yeah.""

""And they're named Bill and Ted?""

""Yeah.""

""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Why?""

So I explained the issue that I had and that weekend we watched the movies. Seriously. Who the fuck would deliberately name their kids Bill and Ted.

Fastforward a few of years and my kids are teenagers and costing more money, so I take a second job delivering pizzas.

A few weeks in and I'm chatting to one of the women there about kids and stuff. I mentioned that my kids used to go to this primary school, and she said asked their names.

""NO WAY. I remember them. My kids are Bill and Ted."" 

""WTF?? You're the one that named your kids Bill and Ted?""

*Grin and nod*

""And you named them after THE Bill and Ted?""

""Yeah. They're awesome movies. We watch them a couple of times a year.""

I love this woman. She is hilarious and doesn't give a fuck what anyone thinks.&&They're waiting until Keanu can play a 50-year-old unfortunately. &&Sounds like the next Tool album. &&Believe, or I'll put you in the iron maiden.&&This reminds me of what Winona Ryder said about Beetlejuice 2...&&Seriously. Gee I wonder if there's an audience for 80s throwbacks here in the time of Stranger Things and Star Wars and Tron.&&I focused on that part, too. Like, the audience for this movie are people who fell in love with the first 2. Why bother with a reboot to attract new fans? It's not like Bill & Ted are characters that have stretched far beyond their reach. They're their own thing, they have their own place, and the people who want to see this movie are interested in how they've evolved. I wouldn't give a shit if they rebooted the story to feature two jumpy Disney Channel teens who send air guitar emojis to each other in the hopes of saving the world with an app they must develop to pass computer class.&&> the original was a cult hit, there really wouldn’t be the audience to justify the expenditure.

Just like how Blade Runner 2 panned out.

You are talking about us. The folk who buy the tickets are the reason.&&If it's a cult hit with ""no audience,"" why bother with a reboot at all?

They've all stood the test of time, and do not require a reboot. &&I can’t see how a reboot would even work. Teenagers don’t talk like them or listen to the same kind of music anymore, and those are the main things from the originals that the general public recognizes.

They talk about it on the commentary track of the recent Shout Factory Blu-ray. The obvious sequel would have been Bill & Ted going on another adventure to do another school report. The idea they mention specifically is sending them into works of literature to meet with fictional characters. Instead they wrote Bogus Journey which is almost certainly the most bizarre sequel ever made.&&Nah that Alanis Morsette you’re thinking of.

So easy to make a movie where something went wrong and we ended up with the time line we currently live in.

Slowly they fade out and we fade back into the band in the green room right after the concert.  Bill (or Ted) is saying ""...and then it turns out air guitar fixes air pollution!"" while the rest of the band looks on, either enraptured or bored.

Someone sticks their head in ""alright guys, head out, we need to clean up"".  ""What, no rest for the saviors of humanity?"" Ted (or Bill) asks.  ""Saviors of humanity?"" the stage manager laughs, ""All you guys did was win a battle of the bands, get over yourself.""

Cut to modern times with the world as it is today.  Wyld Stallyns (minus Death and Station) fronted by 50 year old Bill and Ted are playing in a small nightclub, desperately trying to hype up a lackluster crowd.  After their poor showing they have a band meeting to try to figure out where things went wrong...&&Have you watched the news lately?  Clearly the timeline was altered.&&Iron Maiden?

Edit: A word. &&He's aged. Well, but still.

He was involved in something about preserving Frank Zappa's house that they we're showing at the Alamo Drafthouse af few years ago.

Which makes sense, because he's the one making a Frank Zappa movie, but still. And yes, it was before a Frank Zappa thing.&&>""There’s actually a scene – one of my favourite scenes in the whole movie – where middle-aged, 50-year-old Bill and Ted return to the Circle K and see their teen selves and Rufus, **and actually interact with their teenage selves, played by their actual teenage selves.**""&&He actually just came to a double-feature showing of both Bill and Ted movies in my city last weekend. He looked fine. I mean, he looked his age, but he looked good. &&Alex?&&He looks great, although he looks way more English in his middle age.

He doesn't look like a typical Californian anymore. He looks like a typical English guy.&&Probably young Rufus played by someone else. &&Good point to remember&&we're fucked. I hope my grandkids get to see it :/&&I'm fairly sure he exists in multiple places at the same time just to take photos with his fans.&&Holy shit! It's there!! 

Imagine if that was true. That would be some next level marketing. &&Nah, bro. In the future, we gotta remember to make the movie in the past so that the totally radial actor who played Rufus will still be alive and we don't have to use that totally bogus CGI to fake him and a young Bill. &&Holy shit, this is a perfect project for Netflix&&I mean, it's either going to or it's not. 50/50&&And there's only a 10% chance of that. &&It's a passion project for Keanu, not a money grab, so I'm confident.&&I think it will be fine.

None of the stuff I read about Louis seemed that horrible, like clearly he's got his perversions and he needed his shit checling, but he's no Weinstein. The two stories I read about Louis ck, one seemed to me like it was a massive miscommunication between him and the involved parties(the hotel one where he whacked it out after he said he would after he invited them back to his room and they said yeah, but 'didnt really think he would do it). The other is the one whacking off on the phone which is like, yeah it's weird and shouldn't be allowed but the absurdity to me of that one was kind of validated when Dave chapel let said what id been saying the whole time in his new special. ' why not just put the fucking phone down?'. And like I sympathise with these girls I really do but some of these ones with Louis and this one with Aziz Ansari just sound like encounters with people who've lived in a retarded hollywood bubble their whole lives, and their first exposure to an unpleasant experience seems to just leave them like a deer in headlights when everyone I know personally would've done or said something. I dunno maybe it's another layer of Hollywood fucker that's specifically drawing in these weak willed vulnerable girls whose reaction to a guy whacking it on the phone is to... Carry on until he finishes and then decide it was inappropriate years later. I just feel like some of these people have gotta be inhumanly unassuming. But I admit, I'm probably wrong and making assumptions based on the way these stories have been told to me.
&&> Honestly Louis Ck probably will make a comeback at some point but I couldn’t imagine there wouldn’t be at least a few years in there of nothing from him. This movie would have to be several years away for Louis to be a realistic option.

I agree. He's got a few years in the doghouse, yet.

I dont have strong feelings about him, btw ; never watched his act/show, nor endorse that kinda Jack Off maneuver. But whatever.

On a tangent: I can always guess if someone is British when I’ve the sound off on the tv - and (since I’m living in Britain) typically can guess what region too.

Maybe it'll be another cult hit and sell tons of DVDs, but that's no guarantee.

Irish people (and Americans- am American!) tend to speak more quickly and the words are less drawn out, making it harder to distinguish. One exception I can think of are those from the southern states of the USA. You get the elongated vowels again and I can definitely pick out when someone really southern is on TV without hearing them talk. &&What’s interesting about Alex Winter, is that neither of his parents are British.

&&I see this movie being one of two things: 

* An interesting almost lovecraftian horror-thriller

* Or an absolutely dumpster fire

Either way I feel like we win a little bit.

The two leads are teenage girl types, so I can see it being about the  attempted murder the documentary was about.  Seems too soon if that's true, but when has that stopped Hollywood.  It's probably so they can slap a 'based on true events' in the trailer.&&Well...Javier Botet is Slender Man in it so he should look cool at least?&&Gimme Twenty Dollars!

The intro will be something like: A computer keyboard. A finger presses a key and leaves a bloody fingerprint. A shot of the computer screen as the person with the bloody hand types “I did it for you...” dramatic zoom as the word “S-L-E-N-D-E-R-M-A-N” is typed out with a loud horror sound. Cut to dark foggy blue woods, cracking sticks, a shot of a crow cawing and flying away. Closeup of flies buzzing around a dead body. More cracking sticks. Slender begins to emerge from the trees, music swells more and gets obnoxiously loud with some weird digital distortion and right as we’re about to see his face - cut to a shot of a couple emo girls in school. Then the rest of the movie happens and it’s predictable. &&I just want to see someone make a good Slender Man movie someday.

Honestly, I would be interested in a Slender Man movie. Mostly because I still think it's fascinating how a folklore was created in such a digital age.

Yes Slenderman was more relevant a few years ago, but it really could be a great premise to a horror movie if done well.&&Everyone is bashing the film for being too late, but what if this movie is just the beginning? Maybe 2018 is the year of the Slender Man&&Movie tagline:

*He wants his $20*&&Honestly, the original slenderman photos scared me so much in college that I thought I saw him whenever I smoked pot with my buddies. There were times I’d be walking around campus late at night and anything from lampposts to street signs seemed to warp into his shadowy figure. I’ll never understand why, but slenderman to me will always be the most profoundly frightening horror of all urban legends.&&Inb4 it's a horror masterpiece&&I hear the reboot is already under way Its called ""fat bastard""&&I can't trust Hollywood anymore. Seriously, why is this being chosen for a movie over [Splendorman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MXYC_jX2Wc)&&I wonder how many little girls will stab their friends over this now that it’s a movie.&&To be fair, that's a nice poster.&&What is it, 2011 again?&&Fun Fact: There is actually a Slender Man movie already called Always Watching which was inspired by a YouTube series from Marble Hornets! &&This came out when I was in middle school and you better believe it scared the absolute daylight out of me and my friends. I was so bad off that I had to search for something to tell me it wasn't real, and even then, the visual of Slenderman still creeps me the fuck out and is still enough for me to want to sleep with the lights on. 

I would love for this to be a good movie. I haven't seen a GOOD horror movie in so long. The last one to really fuck with me was probably ""It Follows."" I really enjoyed the remake of Steven King's ""IT"" but not because it was scary, I just liked the movie. 

I feel like the biggest downfall of horror films is that they are usually rated R. And that really cuts down on the audience that can see it, which in turn hurts the budget of the film (companies aren't going to dump a ton of money into a film that most people won't even be able to watch). I say cut out the gore and completely unnecessary sex scenes and make this PG-13. Focus more on the paranoia and suspense that is associated with the Slenderman character and give us a solid plot to follow. If they do that, I could see this movie doing well. Regardless, I loved the character when I was younger, and will probably go see this anyway, partly for nostalgia, and partly because I've wanted this movie to come out since I was in middle school. &&Slender Man was amazing when it first came out. It was uncertain if it was real or not. It took an easy search to find it was fictional, but it spread by word of mouth. I remember talking about it with classmates in college in 2009/10 as we were dossing and we looked it up and watched videos, not sure or caring if real or not. The entire idea spooked us silly and disturbed our fascination for days. 

When the video game came out, it was honestly the scariest thing we had ever played, it was so good and simple. The entire heart beat and 'out of corner of eye' was amazing.

But the thing is, Slender Man became so big you can find out it was fictional within seconds. There has been so many adaptions already and parodies that it lost the spooky wonder of it. It was such a great modern day Lovecraftian monster. But, it has all died off, and this movie will be as predictable as we all know it will be.&&I wonder how that even works. I assume the Something Awful guy gets paid, I wonder how much.&&Hopefully they do a groverhaus tie-in.&&Well, Yahtzee Croshaw hailed from SomethingAwful, so it can't be *all* bad&&I really wanna know if that guy gets paid or something. Isn’t it technically his intellectual property?&&There was a cartoon tv show that started on somethingawful also 

&&That's not even the craziest part of it - go watch the documentary ""Beware the Slenderman"" - it's about kids that believe it's real. &&Seriously. Same with the Angry Birds movie. Came out way after its peak popularity.&&['The Internship' Poised To Be Biggest Comedy Of 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBLBqM7B4Q) (*The Onion* video from 2013.)&&Anyone else excites about the Neill Blomkamp/Peter Jackson Halo movie??!

&&They made an emoji movie, so why not?&&[I don’t think they can ever top this](https://youtu.be/6kIsEzEmI9w) &&That's kind of the problem though, beyond a still image there isn't much to slender man. &&This could usurp [The Phantom Menace](http://www.hometheaterseattle.com/assets/images/movies/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-movie-1999.jpg) for the award of highest ""quality of movie poster to quality of actual film"" ratio&&It's going to fucking suck, but I love me a good piece of shit horror film.&&Totally agree here. There's a lot of space for fuck ups (please god don't give him back tentacles) but also the character has longevity and appeal because he really is creepy, if they do it well in a relatively minimal style I think this could be great. I think it's pretty lame for people to be acting like the idea has 0 legs&&This is the only way they'll pull it off honestly, I hate to say 'make it like It and Stranger Things' but with Marble Hornets as well as the general age-range of people who are fans of the Slenderman lore, having the main characters being kids trying to find out if the myth is true would be a great angle.  Slenderman is also basically the perfect type of monster for putting him in the background of shots without being very noticeable, as that's kind of where the whole allure of the character started iirc, so there is a huge opportunity there to use that to make him feel present once things get going without him being directly shown and being based on jumpscares.  Like once shit starts going down you could just give him this presence like he's always watching them from afar to really unnerve the viewer, potentially without them even knowing why.  It's like how in It Follows there are a bunch of subtle things regarding the sets and how oddly it moves through seasons, or how in Insidious there are a few moments where there is straight up a figure in the edge of the frame but nobody in the movie notices and just walk past.  Small things that you don't consciously notice that contribute to a feeling of unease.  Slenderman would potentially be perfect for this.  Hell, I'm no afficonato of Slenderman lore but seeing some of the images where all those shadowy tendrils come out you could almost even make it sort of Lovecraftian in that he's this mysterious creature we don't learn about that just exists and seems to like observing humans with what looks like a shoddy attempt at giving itself a human form.

...But the cynical part of my brain is telling me it's just going to be a generic monster-terroizes-teenage/adult-woman-in-her-house-by-the-woods and, like you said, a bunch of unnecessary backstory.  Plus the fact that the super popular game Slender was all about jumpscares means they are probably going to rely on them as well.  I'm interested in the directions they can take it but honestly the amount of times I've been burned by horror films I'm not too hopeful.&&[deleted]&&Stop giving them ideas&&>‘he was a man in a suit that hung himself in a forest’.

The belief among many demons, ghosts and associated creepy entities is you can't scare people if you are fat - you will just be laughed at.

Its why Slender mostly eats children as they are snack size. I try and tell any entity stalking me that any phantasmal shape is beautiful and its about how well you creep me out, not what shape apparition you appear. But those media images of Slender everywhere have a huge effect on ghosts and wraiths. They all want the ""Slender silhouette"" as they call it. Me, I like a little cushion for the scary pushin.

Yeah, the ""Small town kids investigating supernatural goings on"" is the cliché at this point. Please no, I want something new. Wouldn't mind adults. Slenderman was a thing years ago. The ""fans"" at the height of it's popularity are adults now.

Then again, what should I expect from a film that thinks it's a great twist to suddenly reveal that the new character Will Benson isn't actually who he says he is, but rather he's the son of the killer, Ben, hence Benson. Because he's Ben's son. Benson. *Ben's son.* *Benson*. BEN'S SON. BENSON. **BEN'S SON**. **BENSON**

HOW CLEVER IS THAT?!

EDIT: Sorry for the edit, but I don't think I explained the twist well enough.

You see, it's a great plot development because *he's actually Ben's son*, and so used the alias *Benson* as a way of taunting his dad's victims without them even realising it.

BECAUSE HE'S BEN'S SON, HENCE BENSON. DO YOU SEE?

Edit: did some digging and found a video interview with Colfer. He seems to trust everyone involved enough to step back, but the current people involved have expressed that Colfer still has a say in the matter and can influence how things go.

I just dug around to see if it's up for free somewhere but sadly not.&&A PACKED THEATER NED&&>Not until the sequel cums out

why is this suddenly turning sexual&&Basically what Slender's original concept was, I guess.&&Not necessarily. That deals with the nature of the horror, what he wants is something closer to Alien but more psychological than a primal horror&&So, Lovecraftian horror is kind of like that functionally, but not like that for the same reasons.

Lovecraftian horror (or cosmic horror) absolutely breaks down if you show the monster, or allow people to even really interact with it (ie shoot it) to any effect. This is because the monsters or beings in Lovecraftian horror are supposed to be so impossible, so horrifying, to make the viewer so insignificant that they are driven insane. Due to the fact that it would be impossible to really accomplish this in a movie, showing a ""Lovecraftian"" monster generally undermines it because, well, it doesn't drive you insane.

On the other hand, when showing the monster in most horror movies undermines it it's because when you give a thing a very cgi (and not honestly overly terrifying) face it does indeed undermine whatever you had dreamed up for it.

**However**, this is not always the case. For example one of the movies I always point to as a good example of, if not horror movies in general (though I personally like it) good monster design is The Void (2016). That movie has moments when you see some monsters near the very beginning of the film, but because of the well designed (and made via practical effects) creatures doesn't undermines the terror. 

The later parts of the film are a better example of creating a more Lovecraftian terror (ie what the ""Void"" actually is). The Void can do Lovecraftian horror because the forces behind the events of the movie (the ""Void"" are never really defined more than abstractly, and even then not really until the very end. Tasteful CGI helps in this capacity, and the movie can do this more easily because it has a backbone of more practical, simply visually disturbing monsters caused by these forces. 

To provide a counterpoint, Alien is a good example of a movie where the movie isn't undermined by showing the creature (because H.R. Geiger is quite good at what he does) yet isn't Lovecraftian horror. This is because while the alien is perfectly capable of killing the crew, it isn't supposedly immortal or world shattering, it's just scary enough that you the viewer observe that fact.

To provide a succinct example for people that haven't see one or more I give you [this video](https://youtu.be/6QFwo57WKwg) that traumatized me as a child.

The first part of the horror in here is because the monsters are visually disturbing,but it is just that, bloody disturbing. This is more your standard horror. The very end is a more Lovecraftian flavor, the being vaguely visible is a) vaugley visible, obviously massive and fantastic and b) obviously affects the person viewing it, as we can very clearly see what happens to the girl just from looking at it.&&Sinister remains the only horror movie I've ever just stopped watching and three or four years later STILL refuse to return to.&&Right, when Slenderman (or The Operator) is used as a force of nature rather than a character is when Slenderman stories are at their best&&Gotta rewatch it now, thanks.&&This was the major problem with the MH movie (although I enjoyed it overall): You knew Slenderman was going to show up, whereas in the series, you never knew whether he would. That was part of the suspense. &&Absolutely. Everyman Hybrid have had an interesting thing going at various points of their story, too.&&Eh, the black tendrils (more than tentacles, really) were definitely part of the initial appeal. They blended him into backgrounds like trees etc, made it seem more like he was some kind of natural force imperfectly imitating a man. &&I kind of assumed the tentacles were shadows that he could control and manipulate off his body and he used those to snag people. &&Tentacles on Slenderman is original. MarbleHornets were the ones that popularized the mythos, and their Slenderman had some form of tentacles/branches/spiderlegs occasionally.

Edit: u/sgtpnkks is correct that MarbleHornets only popularized the mythos and the original image was from the something awful forums.&&Thought it may have been original&&It'll only be lame if they make him a creature feature octopus squirming up to his victims. However, it's a neat aesthetic if it's used for atmosphere in the way his tentacles have been most typically portrayed (just there for the blink of an eye).

And tentacles have been part of his core mythos since some of the early boards. At the very least, he had tentacles within the span of a year. &&> the only reason it was ever an element of the character was hop ons desperate to make an already well realised monster even more scary

That's definitely not the reason.  Slender man originated from these [two](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/first-pic.jpg?quality=65&strip=all) [images](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theslenderman/images/8/88/Slenderman%40.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415050637).  and you can clearly see he has the tentacles in the right one.  they've literally always been a part of the character.&&I kind of agree, but at the same time, the limbs were in the original SomethingAwful images, and I think the reason they're there is because in the ""lore"" Slenderman comes from the forest, so whenever you're in a forest and see a particularly skinny tree out of the corner of your eye, you'll be startled. It's also part of the medieval German folklore that inspired Slenderman.&&It was actually kinda lame how Slendy *lost* his tentacles, because of how hard that was for the amateur video producers to film.&&Extremely unlikely as to be near impossible, but this movie would be incredible if they played up this angle, or something approximate to it.

Slenderman is an unexplainable creature, yet it one thing that is sure about it is that it preys on humans. It has these exaggerated 'human' traits that make it unnatural and it uses those traits to hunt us- humans. The dynamic has been reversed- we are the prey, the animals hunted by something with impossible advantages over us just like we have over deer or cows. *That*, to me would be creepy.&&Give him your soul or maybe your twenty dollars (bung bung bung bung)&&That is probably one of thew worst movie trailers I have seen as well. I honestly do not even know how people still watch these films. Its just a bunch of jump scares and gross monsters.&&That’s pretty much exactly what most horror films bank on. A lot are made with such low budgets and don’t spend as much on  marketing as blockbusters do that the initial weekend release makes back all the money and some. And if it tanks after that opening weekend it doesn’t really matter, they made their money.&&Also they get to define a slenderman fiction, if they did it at the height of the meme popularity they'd basically be graded on sticking to the 'source material'&&No, the FNAF movie doesn't have a release date yet.&&>Apparently it got out of their hands and turned out to be kind of terrible

So keeping in tradition with Marble Hornets then.&&it was weird. the dude from fanboys was in it and took me out of it completely. You can't have low budget horror with known actors. it takes you out of it. Also, the film itself was meh. Slender could only be seen on tape that they recorded so most of it was cutting between live feed or slender looking at them weirdly and then them being tossed by some wires on the set. &&I remember I was in middle school and still liked him I  had started following Pewdiepie from his first Cry of Fear. He was decently known by the letsplay community but he wasn’t a household name like now. But I remember once his Slender video came out this wave of people just swarmed his channel and he was suddenly one of the most popular youtubers. I quit watching him  10-12 months after but he’s only gotten bigger since which I’m sure everyone knows. It’s just crazy to see a screaming little Swedish gamer who you used to talk to on YouTube messages become this enormous let’s play icon. &&Holy shit no! When? How old were they??&&He has a disease, I forget the name.

Everything actually seemed to matter more than just Artimas out smarting people.&&I know it did good in Asia, so maybe we will get lucky and have a pacific rim scenario where they make a sequel cause it did so well over seas&&Mainly because it had thematic elements relatable to normal movie formulae, I imagine. I feel like some of the other plots are too farfetched for a common audience. I may be underestimating the common audience.&&I enjoyed the movie far more than I thought I was going to period&&What's kinda funny is it might actually be the best movie adaptation of a video game of all time.&&Idk I'm backing outta here&&You just made me sad again. :(&&Ugh yeah the character concepts were just super unfortunate. A lot of theories floating around that the characters had to be ""adult portrayals"" for the live action film; as it would be too racy for American audiences otherwise. Which would absolutely be out of line with the theme of the franchise. Shit's traumatic because it's happening to kids, and Evangelion is basically philosophical trauma porn and allegory for coping with depression and finding your purpose in an unforgiving society.&&But he made the right choice. A pg13 movie wouldn't have been bioshock. Little sisters would be harvested by feeding them candy until they vomit rainbows that power up your love-raygun that you use to put enemies to sleep while you fight your way through Rapture that looks suspiciously like the old sets from the Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory movie.&&Global Financial Crisis. &&Oh hell yeah, those shorts are amazing. Rakka in particular feels very much like a follow-up to the cliffhanger of District 9, even though they’re not technically connected. Zygote is also definitely worth a look, one of the most disturbing movie monsters I’ve ever seen. && I'll have to look into this, thanks for the title. &&BRING ME THE SILVER SCREEN STRETCHER!&&Because Sony just wants you to snuggle up and chill with their Shitty, Sexualized Cartoon-Verse™ including such classics as the Emoji Movie, Hotel Transylvania 2, and Open Season 3.&&When has *any* comment thread on Reddit *not* turned sexual?&&He was created by some Photoshop artist who drew on his childhood fears of tall, faceless figures. 

Never mind Marble Hornets, I wonder if he's getting credit/royalties.&&The swimming pool scene really fucked me up. Also that backwards music from the car scene.

I'll probably have trouble getting to sleep now just from thinking about it. There has to be something primal it accidentally triggers&&That lawnmower scene gets me every time. I'm never prepared. &&Like Cthulhu. The cultists are the ones to watch out for. &&Yeah, as /u/creepyeyes says below, he's best used as a sort of force of nature and influence. If you have him being a constant presence, it kinda personifies him which he works best when he's this unnerving, unmoving, just thing pulling strings behind the scenes.&&Exactly. Part of the appeal of the myth is that he looks just human enough to reach the uncanny Valley. The tendrils help add a layer of confusion to his appearance for the human brian. It looks human, but it's not. It looks like a monster, but not quite.

Edit: I'm leaving it dammit. &&I agree I’m pro-tentacle slenderman and not for fetish reasons.&&If they're done right, they could work well. Making him blend in and make you unsure if those are trees blowing, or something else. The mistake is when they're overused and shown way too clearly. It comes off as cartoony then.&&Improper proportions give a disturbing vibe all on their own. Combine that with unnatural movement (often done by filming the actor walking backwards, then reversing the film) and its downright disconcerting. It falls straight into uncanny valley, and does so intentionally.

No cartoonishly evil appendages needed. No horns, no forked tongue, no wings, none of those tired old things needed. Just wrong proportions and wrong movements do the trick.&&I always figured his man in a suit shape was a disguise used to hunt prey.

I'm a big fan of the Director, and I enjoyed Insidious 1 and 2 (both of which the scariest scene for me wasn't even a jump scare).

And of course The Conjuring was a great movie.&&See: Unfriended&&god forbid they spit on the sanctity that is the canon of a somethingawful thread&&I'd love to see an X-Files-type SCP series though.&&Give it three years&&My problem with a lot of these fan series is that they tend to try and involve their own spooky figure outside The Slender Man...  With Marble Hornets it was mask guy, and there was another one with a dude who self-inserted his Slendy OC alongside the monster.

I think the problem stems from the fact that they don't want to overuse Slender Man himself because seeing too much of him just makes him less scary. So that's why we get the silly mask guy in Marble Hornets and ""HABIT"" in Everyman Hybrid (a character so stupid, terrible and unintimidating, it almost makes me glad that series tapered off.

He's being credited as the original creator in a ""based on..."" fashion, but he's not doing any writing apparently.&&I wouldn't want that either. I was just wondering if the original creator of Slenderman (not Marble Hornets) was going to be credited for his creation now that it's been adapted into a movie. &&... and then YouTube, and then the entire Internet, and then the news, and then he died. And now this film is trying to resurrect him. I was a **huge** Slendy fan back in the day... but after Marble Hornets ended, I kinda grew out of him.

I lost track of it because of loss of interest, but it's a neat little piece of media that flourished out of the internet.  Heck, I even dressed as Slendy at Dragoncon one time.  Took a pic with the Marble Hornet guys.

I think I just enjoy Slenderman being the FOCUS of these shows.  I understand them wanting to have their own voice, but when the mask guy subplots take up more time then creepy Slendy encounters, then I start to lose interest.  

I still strongly remember the episode where MC is exploring this abandoned concrete building, and he just turns the corner and slendy is there with a large burst of static.  Awesome stuff.  Mask guy chasing MC around a house?  Ehh...&&If you didn’t have masky, it would have been all Slenderman all the time. Given the length of the series, you needed a character like that to break things up a bit. &&> Just guess I never realised there was this strong hate for Marble Hornets.

I think hate is a strong word. I think it just sort of petered out toward the end for everyone but the die-hard fans of the story.&&EMH was so good when it came out.  The initial gimmick where they were putting a fake slenderman in the background to mess with the viewers, and the real one eventually came was just hilarious.  And I loved Evan's acting.

*But they just couldn't end the fucking thing*.   No resolution.  The end game has been going on for four years now.  It was really disappointing, because for a group of 3 college-aged amateurs, they really knew how to tell a compelling story with ARG elements.  

If they made it end at episode 40 or whatever, it would be considered an underground web masterpiece.&&Wow doesn't feel that long ago.

Those are my favorite episodes because they capture the feeling of Slenderman perfectly. Remember the episode where hes in that underground area and finds a doll, only to turn around and see Slendy slowly peaking around the corner?  OHHH MAN that was good stuff. And the static effects were well done.&&I agree with this. And depending on how its done it can serve the plot pretty well. I think Marble Hornets did ok with it. I was satisfied.

They did it out in the woods during a sleepover, some cyclist (?) found the girl I believe. She's alive.&&Fate of the forgetfu--where am I?&&some are great, some aren't. 

\#4 is a good ""revival"" to the series, and #5 is amazing. #6 feels very out of place and isn't very good. #7 is my personal favorite, and like i said #8 isn't very satisfying and is a bit rushed.

overall, i think it's worth reading, but they get pretty complicated after the original trilogy. &&5 is absolutely fantastic and superb, 7 is also pretty good. 6 is one of my favorites but I can understand if it's not a popular choice for everyone. I've only read 8 once, many years ago so I can't speak for it's quality. &&The horror movie he most recently wrote a screenplay for has a 7.4 rating on imdb.

Glad to such a well thought out approach to what could have easily been a forgettable film.&&The opening sequence, where everything is floating as though it were underwater, was shot on a dry set with lighting to make it look underwater.

That fact alone qualified him as best director.&&If anybody alive deserves that honor, its him&&My girlfriend drove 3 hours to Kansas City to see this film. It was well worth the drive for the film alone, but we also made a day-trip of it and visited a lot of other neat things in KC, which made the whole experience even sweeter.

And while the film was incredible from all perspectives, I still learned over to my girlfriend as the end credits began to play and said, [""We drove three hours to watch a woman fuck a fish-man.](#spoiler). We both had a really good laugh that got some strange looks. &&Now give this man complete control over a Justice League Dark, or any Star Wars film. &&Excuse me, ""The Shape Of Water"" is a beautiful interspecial love story with sex that made my mom extremely uncomfortable.&&This was such a beautiful movie. I picked this one at the theatres on a whim, and it was amazing. If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. Everything from the aesthetic to the storytelling, and care to detail. It's easily one of my favorites. It really felt magical.&&What about Pan's Labyrinth? That doesn't count?&&..first ABOVE THE LINE award given to a MONSTER movie in... attention... Modern Hollywood ""history"".

 What is not modern, yesterday???&&I’m so happy for Guillermo! Wish he’d won it sooner though, maybe the studios would have gave him a chance to pursue more ideas (Hellboy 3 instead of a reboot...). I hope they do now!&&He needs to direct the bride of Frankenstein starring gal gadot&&What about movies where the monster is.....man himself?&&Doesn't matter, according to Natalie Portman, because it was won by a man. &&And he deserved it. Natalie Portman’s dig was uncalled for. I understand the concern, but everyone nominated in that category put on an absolute directing masterclass with their respective films. You could say Greta Gerwig should have been nominated, but I don’t see LadyBird on the same tier of filmmaking as her competition. &&I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I think the Exorcist at least borders on being a monster movie.&&seems kind of fishy to me&&I don’t know what it was but I could not get into this film at all. I understand why it is critically acclaimed; the entire setting of the movie is extremely well-crafted especially the music (gave me a Bioshock vibe), the cinematography is top notch, it is well-acted and the plot is extremely unique and fresh. 

However I felt that Eliza as a main character was selfish, unrelateable, and overall a little boring. This woman falls in love with a monster, why? Because he eats her eggs? And all of the sex scenes seemed out of place in the overall scope of the movie. I don’t know, can someone please explain to me what I am missing? The movie is exceptionally done. But the relationship with Eliza and the monster seemed so forced and hand-waved that it was hard for me to root for them to succeed. I was honestly pulling for Michael Shannon’s character in the end, and he was a complete jackass. But at least his character made sensible decisions! &&And Natalie Portman had to make the nominations about gender&&At The Mountains of Madness now, please!&&Haven't seen it yet, you think ol girl gets to taste that fishstick tho?&&He deserved this award, he deserves an Oscar. The Shape of Water deserves best picture. It is a beautiful monster film that is sweet an bizarre and perfect&&I like the film, but I would not be surprised if the story about The Shape of Water lifting elements from a 2015 short film picks up steam out of nowhere. I'm honestly surprised this isn't being talked about more since the similarities are too distinct to just be a coincidence.

&&Well, it really is just that. When the whole ""Dark Universe"" thing was still, well, a thing, Del Toro went to Universal with an idea to adapt/update/reimagine the Creature from the Black Lagoon movies, with his take being to shoot it from the Creatures POV, and making the romance angle more prominent.

I feel like he has such a range of different movies from artsy to cliche action that he's bound to have something for everyone. 

I guess with The Shape of Water he might actually have something for everyone *now*.&&Nobody better to make an homage to monster movies than del Toro. He's had a lifelong fascination with them and has developed into one of the greatest story tellers of modern cinema.&&They did the same thing in the Lord of the Rings movies.

Now, I know you did say ""complete control"", but that's not something you typically get when directing yet-another-Star-Wars movie or yet-another-DC-comics-movie. Del Toro's best movies (the three he mentioned in his award speech) were all original stories (with original characters, universes, etc.) written by Del Toro himself. I say let him do more of *that*.&&> complete control over [...] any Star Wars film.

YES!!!&&I thought of seeing this film with my mom but I think that it's not very suitable then &&From the pic I saw it looks like the frog dude from hellboy trying to get it in with a hottie.&&Yeah, they're sensationalizing a little bit too hard.

I think a lot of journalists are doing this.  So many records are broken or ""firsts"" had that they're struggling to find more inspiration, so they keep adding qualifier after qualifier to make something sound as thrilling as if it were genuinely a first or otherwise groundbreaking.

Transparent as fuck to some, but a lot of people are going to be misled as fuck from stuff like this.

It's not just movies, it is everything, especially politics.&&Same. He is one of my favorite directors. When I left the theater with my girlfriend I said, “I’m really happy Del Toro got to make his weird fish movie.”

I liked the shape of water, but it isn’t my favorite that he’s made.&&He may have a chance at Mountains of Madness getting funding. But us rabid Lovecraft fans have been keeping that rumor alive for years now.&&Meh.  Leave the remakes to Tim Burton.   When all you have is a weird sense of style you can crap all over old B-movie and make money.   Guillermo del Toro is amazingly imaginative so I’d rather r see him create original films rather than remakes.   &&This is pretty much the central theme of monster movies. &&Although so many people are applauding her ""zinger"" comment, I found it to be very disrespectful to the nominees, male or female. 

44 of the 93 members of the HFPA, the people who actually pick the nominees, are women. The president of the HFPA is....a woman. The nominees are chosen in a primary round of voting. Top 5 get nominations. The winner is chosen in a second round of voting. 

I find it hard to believe that sexism had anything to do with who actually got the nominations. I am sure that quite a few female directors got votes in the first round, just not enough to make the top 5. There are plenty of very talented male auteurs who also didn't make the cut this year. And if there had been 6 nominees up for best director, I can almost guarantee that Kathryn Bigelow would have made the cut for Detroit (IMHO). Unfortunately, there has to be a cut-off.

If Natalie Portman feels that women aren't being equally represented as directors, she should put herself back on the other side of the camera, as she has already done in the past, and she can try to get a nomination for best director herself. I wish her nothing but the best in that endeavor. &&Don't think that was the intent of the comment. If you watch del Toro's post show Q&A and he didn't seem bothered at all. In fact he was getting lots of questions and praise about how the female lead in his story was so well done, and relevant to the times. Excluding any perceived slight to del Toro I think there was at least one female director that deserved a nomination. Whole thing is blown way out of proportion in my opinion. &&> Doesn't matter, according to Natalie Portman, because it was won by a man.

She did not say that.&&And where was anyone calling out the hundreds of sympathizers in Hollywood? There's photographs of Oprah Winfrey kissing and hugging Harvey Weinstein but she still gets called for a presidential run because she told everyone how fierce they are.&&What an absolute pathetic comment for her to make. Is he supposed to feel bad because he's a man who won best director?&&Maybe she should direct a great movie. Apparently it's really easy.&&I think what made her comment so frustrating was that Del Toro isn't a mainstream director. He's a weird Mexican cult movie guy getting credit for a monster movie. That's groundbreaking, just not the ground she wanted broken in that particular moment. It's not like it went to Christopher Nolan. &&It's interesting that I disagree with this and can't put my finger on why. I feel like a vital part of a monster movie is the gawking at the physical form of the monster. I mean, look at two staples, Hunchback of Notre Dame and Phantom of the Opera. Two human beings with no paranormal powers, they're just physically deformed, but they're monsters. 

On the other hand, while we only get glimpses see Pazuzu's physical form, his physical transformation of Reagan is a key part of the film. And of course there's monster movies where we hardly or even never do see the monster, just its physical effects on the cast (I'd venture calling The Blair Witch Project a monster movie).&&Hmm, I'm not sure. I think part of the classic ""monster movie"" is that the monster is actually just as human inside as the human characters, and that the only reason anything bad happens in the movie (to the monster, but also by the monsters hand) is because people can't seem to look past his ""monster form"". 


King Kong only took the girl hostage and rampaged as a reaction to his subhuman treatment. Phantom haunted the Opera because people shunned him. 


The monster just wants to be accepted, but people don't ever accept him. 


Pazuzu was just written as evil incarnate, I don't think the archetype holds. &&She was lonely, lived a routine life, and the only friends she had were a gay man and a woman coworker.&&You've never felt alone, have you? As someone who's spent much of his life being alone, her actions were so believable to me it was almost uncomfortable. It hit too close to home. &&I thought I was the only one who didn't enjoy it. 

I'm glad I saw it, and I love del Toro. I just found myself bored for most of the movie. There were some wonderful parts, but the pacing felt inconsistent (maybe they had to cut certain footage out) and some of the dialogue forced (Octavia doesn't *always* have to be a sassy black woman). I can see why people liked the film, I just didn't. 

I can appreciate everything, I just didn't like it all together. That's it. *Pan's Labyrinth* is still and will always be in my top 20 films. I can see why *The Shape of Water* is more successful than *Pan's*. I was discussing this with a friend who also considers *Pan's Labyrinth"" to be one of the best films and he felt the same way about *Shape*. We figured that he's probably better at dialogue when writing in Spanish. Anyone else have thoughts on this? &&I agree, I thought this movie was more weird than anything. I found it believable that someone like Eliza might fall in love with a fish man thing, but I didn't see anything that made it particularly human or sympathetic, apart from getting tortured for no reason. Also, the villain and sassy black sidekick characters were super cliche.

Also, as a Russian speaker, the Russian was so laughably bad that my sister and I were cracking up in every scene with Russian, even when the double agent guy gets shot.&&Happy to see a counter-opinion - but I can't even agree on the praise you give: 

> the entire setting of the movie is extremely well-crafted especially the music (gave me a Bioshock vibe), the cinematography is top notch, it is well-acted and the plot is extremely unique and fresh

Come on man - ""the plot is unique and fresh""? Really? I feel like the story could be deduced from the first 5 minutes and the poster alone... there was not a single surprising element that did not follow the template mindnumbing Disney script - it was essentially in a fable-format, with manichean, caricatured characters and linear plot development

Secondly, the noir-style, 1960s setting, vintage setting - all well and good and definitely in tune with current mainstream tastes, including my own, but it felt empty, shallow and forced to me - it could've been executed so much better than just playing Glenn Miller and showing Liz Taylor...

I honestly didn't see anything special or any reason to particularly like the movie, no matter how hard I tried (and I tried - I really wanted this to be good)...

&&His reaction was priceless. Pretty much a wtf? followed by, an ""ok, whatever?"". I love movies, but I've grown to despise Hollywood. &&I basically came here to raise this point. 

[The Space Between Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZO9uh5z47k)

If you watch the short film, some of the similarities, like you say are a bit more than coincidence. 

Given also that this is a 12min(ish) short film, compared to a feature length film - you have to be understanding how a longer film can establish more out of it's content. This is more than the ""Avatar was just Pocahontas in space"" argument, as the core concept for both movies is unnervingly similar - Menial worker saves water 'monster' from laboratory, ~~Hilarity~~ Drama ensues. 

This is the kind of same situation as the similarities between the Twilight Zones' episode ['Special Service'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU3lzvU3q_0) aired in 1989 and the Truman Show. If someone came to you and gave you the twilight episode, and said they wanted to make a full length version of this...but 'different'.. do you think the leap to the Truman show is all that great, seems to me to be the next block down the street.  

This is some X filse bullshit, imo. 

&&Well, both of them had elements right off from Alan Moore's Neonomicon.&&Yes I’d like to hear an actual response on that. It seems too similar for it not to have been seen by him&&thanks for the link!

not to belittle the short in any way (I like it, and I do agree that the similarities are very striking), but I remember an interview where Proyas or the Wachowky brothers (at the time) were asked about the (visual) similarities between the Matrix and [Dark City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_City_(1998_film)) released one year before the Matrix; they all agreed that no one stole from each other, there are simply moments in history when a society exposed to a common threat shares more or less clearly a common way to deal with it

that both the short and del Toro feature a collapsing world where the underdogs, not the decision makers,  are the central actors in the end may simply tell a lot about what we long for, now&&Well it is focused on a monster, it's just not focused on the monster destroying things.&&Its very reminiscent of the old universal monster movies like creatur from the black lagoon and Frankenstein.&&[deleted]&&It is more of a drama really, not even like Stranger Things. The focus is not too much on the monster at all and there are a lot of subplots that do not involve anything creepy or monster related.&& No, it sucked.

Wonder Woman wasn't well directed. It was just like any Snyder trash&&She signed the Polanski letter and acts all righteous. Fuck her. &&I would have liked to see Margaret Betts get a nod for Novitiate.&&In the last 5 movies that Portman has agreed to star in, 4 of those are directed by men.

You’d think if she was as passionate as she wants to appear on the issue of not enough female directors, she’d attach herself to movies that are only directed by women.&&Only WHITE males where nominated, fucking racist natalie portman only thinking about women. /s&&She wasn’t blaming the nominees, she was putting a fine point on the state of the industry despite the gains made this year. I thought it was the perfect zing to bring everyone back to earth after Oprah’s big feel-good speech. &&I would have loved to see GDT say something along the lines of ""thank you for reminding me and all the other nominees to feel bad about our accomplishments this year, Natalie."" 

But to his credit, he reveled in the moment of a deserved win. Good for him. &&If we start nominating people solely because we need to have ""x"" amount of diversity, isn't that the opposite of progressive?  I think most people would rather be up there based on merit as opposed to their gender or race.  &&Ace. Thanks for that 👍🏻&&Top job&&Above the line also includes producers! Except for line producers, I think?&&Would cinematography and score be considered above the line?&&Ah interesting. Cheers Juca.&&To add even more color, above the line sometimes refers to people who gain royalties/points vs those who do not (below the line). &&
No, the line mentioned is not on the call sheet.  It's ""the line"" in the films budget.

From Wikipedia: ""The distinction originates from the early studio days when the budget top-sheet would literally have a line separating the above-the-line and below-the-line costs."" &&I know it would never happen and it probably only works because they only show it in <30 second clips, but I would absolutely watch an animated Twilight Zone parody series. I love Twilight Zone and The Scary Door is one of my favorite long running jokes on Futurama.&&[Shannon's name even appears in the opening credits right as Jenkins says ""monster,"" for extra emphasis.](#spoiler)&&The ""monster"" in the film, the fish man, is played by Doug Jones. 

Michael Shannon plays the human antagonist. OP is saying he is vile enough to be considered the true monster.&&Michael Shannon is explicitly referred to as ""the monster"" in the movie - the opening VO says that this is a story about love and ""the monster that tried to destroy it"" or something to that effect. &&It is. Nothing more monstrous than him in the movie.&&Notice how those two characters are the hypermasculine types too.&&He's great and hilarious in that recent Black Mirror episode, one of my favorite characters in Black Mirror. &&Honestly, I can never see him in anything without thinking about him on Sunny. Something about his voice. &&Guillermo is pappy mcpoyle&&I really think he should win, but goddamn it's going to be hard to watch Nolan lose if he does. Not for all the Dark Knight fanboy loving Nolan nerd reasons inside me, but because Dunkirk is such an expertly crafted and directed film from top to bottom. These are two of the best directed movies that I've ever seen in theaters. It's a shame either of them has to lose. Maybe they'll split the vote and someone else will win even, who knows. &&The tropes were intentional. It's basically beauty and the beast. The movie was never about the plot, it was about the journey. &&I thought it was ok, tropey but enjoyable...certainly not Oscar material. I love Guillermo but I can't say I understand why he got this award.&&Just 2 different sub genres of the 'monster movie' archetype.&&It's sort of like how people forget that Gothic Horror is a subgenre of Romanticism. The classic monster movies take heavy inspiration from gothic fiction, and of course, the romanticism is pretty apparent in a few of them.&&Nightmare on Elm St isn't really a monster movie, it's definitely a slasher and a thriller but Freddy's basically just a deformed human with magic powers. I don't think I'd consider any movie in which the monster has a decent amount of actual lines to be a true monster movie, and the Shape of Water kind of cheated there by making the monster mute but even still he only had a few lines, most of which were just ""egg.""&&I feel like looking at The Shape of Water that way really misses the point of how subversive and inherently modern it is.

The movie is about a monster who abducts a beautiful damsel in distress and brings the victim to his cave-like lair. A down on their luck everyman type character falls in love with the damsel, and becomes the unlikely hero determined mount a rescue. Over the course of the film you realize that the monster is not necessarily purely evil, but is more of a tragic figure who is driven to evil acts by the primitive instincts of his species and a society that encourages and exploits his worst and most destructive behavior.

One of the things that makes the film so interesting is that the short descriptions of the characters don't match up with the old stereotypes at all except on a very superficial level. The main characters are a scaly green amphibious man-like sea creature, a quiet girl who dreams of a better life, and a patriotic US military man. But even with the sound off it would be obvious that the ""monster"" in the film isn't really a monster in the traditional sense.&&Edward Scissorhands in that regard was also a monster movie.&&I've been calling it Free Willy meets Romeo and Juliet&&I mean the Cecile B. Demille/lifetime achievement award is usually the only award of the night to get a long speech. &&I died laughing when he told them to turn down the music and they fucking did lol. Also, Oprah's speech wasn't a thank you speech, it was a special lifetime acceptance speech. They're always given a lot longer for a pre-planned speech. What they should have done, was cut off rambling Nicole Kidman at the beginning. Holy hell, all the Big Little Lies winners were so damn annoying to me for some reason.&&[deleted]&&I think that he nature of the speechs are the reasons of cut / non cut.

It's common to cut the ""thank you"" speech in awards show.

I don't know what Oprah said during her speech but I'm pretty sure it was a engaged piece and it would have created a lot of unnecessary heat to cut her.&&Valuable advertising time going by. Dollars, dollars, dollars.&&Funnily enough, the original 1954 Godzilla was criticized for being nationalistic propaganda back in its day too. I don't think anyone today would say that about the film. Interesting how history repeats itself.&&I could see either, honestly, but i know a lot of Anno's work, and it could also be both in ways. It's not wrong in ways of each country trying to use others for their own advantage, Japan being actually totally unprepared for something like an actual Gozilla popping up, especially the way he was in the film. 

The American recent one was more action oriented, but the non-godzilla parts were stock US action hero, and Godzilla was even the ""he's on our side"" type, vs the Japanese ""Force of nature, get out of its way"" type. The Japanese one stuck with me longer than the American one, and i'm a huge Godzilla fan. &&That's NGE director to you&&The original 1954 Godzilla is still the best movie in the whole franchise in my opinion. There is also Twenty-Four Eyes, which was released in the same year and won several awards over Seven Samurai. It is very beloved in Japan to this day, but sadly not that well-known in the West.&&That's crazy, they have the same lead actor. I never knew they competed for that award.&&The scales look painful! But everything hurts less underwater&&nice&&But she was part-fish, remember. &&> Universal turned him down of course, so he pulled a Bender and just decided to do the damn thing himself.

And Michael Shannon's ass!""&&Considering how dead the dark universe is now I bet he’s glad they turned him down&&I mean, does he even plan on making this a franchise?

Goddamn I loved that movie.&&I love *Pan's Labyrinth*. Since then, I've been going to his movies hoping they might recapture that same magic, but they never do. I really had high hopes for *Crimson Peak* but that didn't quite deliver for me. I haven't seen *Shape of Water* yet, though.&&Aren't people entitled to have their own opinion or taste?

Are we supposed to all like Guillermo Del Toro and Blade Runner 2049 or die?&&Am I the only asshole who loves Kaiju films *and* Guillermo Del Torro but absolutely hated Pacific Rim? Fuck that fucking stupid fucking scientist sideplot  bullshit. He was wrong and you are wrong if you liked him. ^/s I liked the fight scenes but even those were marred by the horrible idea of having 2 pilots at once. &&Do people generally think Pacific Rim is a good film?&&I'll never forgive him for the two hours I lost watching Crimson Peak.&&The detail they did in the shot was phenomenal though, it really was amazing. From the hall into the room.&&Yeah, Denis Villeneuve is a very passionate director. He pretty much only does projects and adaptations out of passion. And I'm sure there's PLENTY more directors (that I don't know as well as Denis and Guillermo ) that fit the bill, so let's not have a need to compare and be happy we have their hearts offered out to the world for us all to enjoy. Rejoice!!&&That's reflected with his casts/crews.

Absolutely everyone seems to love working with him. That's not easy to say about most top directors.&&More than Scorsese? No one loves film more than Scorsese!&&Completely disagree with you. There are lots of directors equally as passionate as him. &&Actually, after watching the last film I’d be happy with him directing the last film of the third trilogy. &&Ooooh, if they ever make a Revan movie he should totally be in charge.&&del Toro has been my top choice for Justice League Dark ever since I saw Pan's Labyrinth. So, it has nothing to do with him (*finally*) being recognised. He's been a legend for a long time in most of our eyes. &&Of cooourse! *laughs in mouse*&&I googled the movie on two separate occasions convinced this was a hellboy origin spin off.&&Was about to defend Tim Burton but then realized this was true :( 

&&You must have a short memory. Tim Burton made Ed Wood, Batman Returns, Sweeney Todd, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. He's a great filmmaker whose just gone to absolute shit in the past 10 years.&&I reallllly want to see a Call of Cultulu from him.

No one else will do it, and even if by some miracle they could... They wouldn't do it as good as he would.

Like the man said though, a movie takes three years of a director's life... The pre-planning, the actual directing, and the promotion. He can only get to so many movies and still do them justice.&&Also, let's not forget that he is Mexican. A year ago, awards ceremonies were praising our foreign film companions. This year, a Mexican director wins for the _first_ time and he's shamed for being male. The poor guy looked very embarrassed on camera, then had to get up and give a speech directly after. The moment should have contained no other emotion than joy and excitement.&&This is why I loved Gal Gadot’s comment about “men and women working together”.  It seemed that the comment from Natalie upstaged Guillermo Del Toro’s win when the man had been “waiting for that moment for 25 years”. He deserved his moment, too.&&>And if there had been 6 nominees up for best director, I can almost guarantee that Kathryn Bigelow would have made the cut for Detroit (IMHO).

While I agree with you overall, Bigelow probably wasn't even in the top 15 in terms of the amount of votes she got (Detroit has been almost entirely forgotten). I'm willing to bet that del Toro, Nolan, McDonagh, Spielberg, Scott, Gerwig, Peele, Guadagnino, Thomas Anderson, Gillespie, Rees, Baker, Joe Wright, Sorkin, and Edgar Wright all got more votes than her.&&It baffels me that people include sexism in everything (racism aswell)... some people vote on quality and don't care/think about the race/gender behind the idea of what they are voting. 

The ""zinger"" from portman is in really bad taste and really dishonors the nominees, would she mention anything if there where all females nominees? No... 

I'm way beyond fed up with this attitude towards things. Just like nobel prizes. There are good female directors aswell, just not good enough this year.

Maybe respect the winners/nominees and shut up about it? 

And who is she, a multimillionaire, to act as a victim of ""opression? She fucking made it..&&It's upsetting because I agree that it's sad that there are so few nonmale directors but this was his moment and he earned it and there was no reason to ruin the moment like that.&&That's what everyone was saying at my house. He's a guy who's poured his life into his work, is estatic to get an award, as are his family members, who are crying and she had to get a digg in that sorta knocked it down a few pegs. Fight for women's equality, just don't put down others to do it. &&You’re on to something here. But I don’t think the issue is that not enough women directors are out there, it’s that not enough are being given the chance to take on some of the more massive projects. But then again, it’s tough for anyone to make it as a director, and Del Toro’s comment about spending 25 years to get to that one moment proves it.

I think over all, it felt like people were jumping around on how they felt about certain situations. In the same night people celebrated the HFPA for being progressive with their diversity, and also slammed them for not having enough diversity in nominees.

A lot of people who spoke used the only platform they have to say really important things, but at the same time it felt as if they forgot celebrate artists and their achievements. Sometimes everything can feel like an uphill battle.&&It's just Reddit being needlessly triggered on his behalf and creating some bullshit controversy out of thin air. 4 women in history have been nominated for best director at the Oscars so it's obvious there is some problem here so i think a harmless jab is pretty insignificant at this point. Basically people complaining about what she said are clueless and stupid.&&reddit people making this a bigger deal than what Guillermo del Toro actully felt that time&&Don't even bother with them, they honestly think that Natalie is a man-hating bitch even though more latino men have won a best director oscar than a women of any race. And this is coming from a latina.




These people need to go outside and stop being offended on the behalf of Del Toro. And if I see one more comment saying that she was even more of a bitch because Del Toro is a minority I'm gonna lose it. Don't pretend to give a shit about latino struggle just to shit on a woman&&If we've learned nothing this past election we should at least learned that voting a celebrity into office through a popularity contest is a shit idea. The irony of all those celebrities who scream from the mountain tops how unqualified trump is were basically saying they would vote for Oprah. Lets not forget that these same people were complicit with what Weinstein was doing (before the media found out) as long as they got parts in Miramax flims but gave Ivanka shit for being complicit with her father. Both are fat pieces of shit but one happens to line their pockets with dough. &&So you’re saying if you took a picture of you hugging your dad, and then found out he raped someone, that makes you a worse person for liking someone who did something you weren’t aware of?&&> Is he supposed to feel bad because he's a man who won best director?

No. So it's a good thing she didn't say anything like that.&&Because monster movies (at least the ones del Toro is influenced by) are about ""monsters"" who are ostracized and rejected by society, but end up being more human than the humans in the movie. Frankenstein, King kong, Creature from the black lagoon, Hunchback, etc. 

Exorcist doesn't fit the bill. &&[deleted]&&I'm with you, it made me really sad that I didn't enjoy it. Makes me feel like maybe I'm just getting too old for new movies. I can't suspend my disbelief enough when the characters dont act multifaceted.

I asked my friend, what movie in the past year he saw where the villian wasn't just completely evil, like black/white, good/evil character, but something more in between. Those are the stories that fascinate me. I just can't relate to a lot of the new movies out there. :(&&I can see what he's thinking, ""Uh, I had nothing to do with the nomination, I'm just getting recognition for a film I've wanted to make for my entire career."" &&Well he did kinda destroy her virginity&&I just felt like it was just so much that I had already seen done before. Plot was so predictable and the characters were unbearably one dimensional I felt like I was watching a made for TV movie at times. The special effects on the monster were really well done but I just think there wasn't much that could be done to save the script.

It would just take someone wanting to do something with Atlantis. &&Perhaps, but I think City of Lost Children is closer.&&I understand that Detroit was powerful but it's not like it had strong direction.

Are you talking about recently? Because Nolan's trilogy is the best we've seen thus far. &&Preach!&&Exactly. It's a good superhero film but what did Patty Jenkins do to deserve an award for directing it? That being said, I can 100% get behind getting Greta Gerwig nominated because Lady Bird is beautifully directed and crafted and she really does deserve it.&&Yeah, maybe I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this, but would people be so blown away by Wonder Woman if it had been directed by a man? Don't misconstrue what I'm saying, women definitely aren't given the same kinds of opportunities in Hollywood as men are, but I can't help but think that the narrative being pushed for Wonder Woman really just boils down to ""It was a good movie THAT WAS DIRECTED BY A WOMAN."" Honestly, if anything, I feel like its degrading in an unprecedented way: it trivializes the efforts of those involved and treats the female director as a gimmick. It makes it seem like Patty wasn't chosen because she was the right director for the job, but because she had a certain marketability as a woman.&&Back in elementary school we had an award called the BUG award, which stood for ""bringing up grades"". As the name implies, it was given to students who showed significant improvement. I would have given Patty a BUG award. Good on you, Patty.&&Lol yeah, Wonder Woman is not as great of a movie as people want to believe it is.&&It’s almost as if the night had a theme everyone missed &&Then she shouldn't have said it right before the nominees were named. It took the air out of the room. &&He has ""white"" skin, but to be fair, Guillermo is Mexican.
&&And then poor Guillermo gets up there to guiltily accept his award, despite being something like the fifth Latino director to ever win.

holy shit...&&It kind of reminds me of figure skating. There has been debate for decades about what’s more important—technical mastery/athleticism or artistry/“heart.” They’re both important, but skaters with incredible ability, who can do backflips on ice, have been passed over for those who seem to sell the routine with more emotion. (I’m not an ice skater, so feel free to tell me I’m wrong about this if you’re an actual professional).

With perhaps the exception of Interstellar (which I wasn’t into), I find Nolan’s films technically impressive but cold and hard to relate to or empathize with. It’s why, although I truly think he’s brilliant, I’m not really into any of his movies. I feel no strong connection to them. They fascinate me, and then I’m done. 

I think awards shows tend to favor the heartstrings, strong characters. And I just don’t think that’s Nolan’s thing. The Joker was his most memorable character, and indeed, Heath Ledger was rightfully nominated.&&And the worst part is that Villeneuve probably won't even be nominated.&&Like does it matter if they win? So many shitty movies win these thing every year and we hardly even remember 1% of them, the golden globes dont matter and the movies these guys make will literally last forever.&&Should be Villeneuve.&&Dunkirk isn't even the best directed Nolan film... lol &&Does Harry Styles being in the movie make Christopher Nolan the One Director?&&Dunkirk was alright, but the music made me feel like it was just a 2 hour anxiety build up to nothing.&&This is fair but when you see a Del Toro movie you usually get quite a bit of unique. &&For me it wasn't that entertaining because everything was so derivative and predictable.&&He got the award for directing.

Probably: the whole system could be better. Apologies for misrepresenting the truth in my OP. 

Cheers mate. &&It’s weird that people would see it as nationalistic then. Large parts of that original 1954 movie are dedicated to a marriage plot and Serizawa’s fear of the proliferation of his WMD &&I don't think I would call it truly nationalistic, but it was one of the first opportunities Japanese people had to root for their armed forces since WWII, as Japan was under heavy censorship and couldn't make war films. It also not-so-subtly blames the U.S. for everything that goes wrong in the movie, and references a then very recent event in which nuclear fallout from an American bomb test contaminated a fishing boat. I could see how that sort of subject matter might be seen as distasteful or rocking the boat as far as international affairs were concerned at that time.&&There's nothing wrong with a little pain.&&I left the theater a little unclear on this.

What happened to him? I've watched some of his more recent films, but they really lack what made those early films so wonderful.

Burton is crazy now and just makes whatever whimsy projects he feels like as long as Depp and Bonham Carter have time. It's sad, I wish we would get some classic Burton movies again..&&>Del Toro's ""Call of Cthulhu""

Mmmmmaybe.

The thing is, while I love the idea of the idea, I also think his best movies (IMO) have a humanist core to them that wouldn't mesh well with the original story's themes. Also, he makes his monsters fun and exciting and scary, rather than unknowable, horrific, and insidious - his style is not the same.

He could definitely do something with an HP Lovecraft-inspired plot, but I don't know about doing anything like a faithful adaptation of ""The Call of Cthulhu."" Maybe ""The Colour Out Of Space"" would be a better fit? Plenty of mutants and room for weird, fun characters operating out of Arkham University.

On a tangent, I'd actually like to see how Jeremy Saulnier would do Lovecraft. He hasn't done straight-up horror or anything supernatural (AFAIK) but he definitely can create scenes of mind-numbing horror and terror and dread. And I think he's got a strong grasp on how to present the darkness of the underbelly of society, which was also a strong Lovecraft theme (though in HPL it was usually blended with racism). Saulnier doing ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" would be interesting. We'll have to see how the next season of True Detective goes, I guess, he's working on that.&&The thing is while it's a great story, it's also a pretty short story. There's like two big beats, and not much else. I'm not even sure you could adapt the ""Voodoo"" cult part without freaking people out. There's enough meat on At the Mountains of Madness, and maybe Dunwich Horror. 

Beside those you could adapt Herbert West-Reanimator as a proper period piece. What really need to happen is a TV anthology.&&> a Mexican director wins for the first time and he's shamed for being male.

Iñarritu won a couple of years back and a couple of years before him Cuaron won. 
&&Oprah Winfrey also made it a point to acknowledge the men who were supporting women in their fight in her speech. Oprah made sure to point out that not ALL men were the enemy, which is a very important distinction to make.&&And nearly rightly too Detroit came out months ago and it wasn't exceptional enough to retain attention till awards season. This happens every year to movies released outside of awards season, it just seems to be how the business works.

Natalie Portman is one of the most privileged people to ever be born.  She was born rich, white, and with connections in Hollywood.  She then stole the moment from a person of color.&&Nobody’s saying she’s a man-hating bitch. They’re just rightfully calling her out on an inappropriate and petty comment that was completely unnecessary. The nominations have nothing to do with sexism, there are plenty of women who vote on these things in multiple rounds of voting. Nominees get nominated because they deserve it more than the others. They’re not just going to bump someone out of the top 5 because there are no women and they need to be “equal.” Imagine if 5 women directed incredible movies and when it came to the nominees, a guy stood up there and said, “And the all female nominees are.” He would be crucified.  &&Hollywood is land of the fake which means a lot of the time it attracts fake people, if you wanna make it in show business a lot of the time you have to throw your morals out the window. I know it’s hard for people to admit because we look at a lot of these people as role models and idols but it’s common in Hollywood for people to whore them selves out to get to the top, rape and assault, be apart of pedophile rings ect. Ironically a lot of the people at the golden globes who have talked out against Weinstein had some idea of what he was doing for many years yet many of them still had no problem working with him, associating with him at parties and events, ‘feminist’ Merly Streep who has been very vocal since the scandal came out at one point called Harvey Weinstein ‘God’. If you take away the good looks, nice clothes, money, fame, success Hollywood is just a bunch of fake, hyporcritical, immoral weirdos.&&""A knowledgeable man knows that Frankenstein's monster is the monster in the story.

No one was sitting at home before Portman spoke going ""man, I wish someone would make a commentary on gender dynamics in hollywood, no one has said anything!"" Had she not said what she said people would still have been uber aware of the theme, and Del Toro wouldn't have had his moment shit on after spending years and years making excellent films.

Not compared to Three Billboards, Lady Bird or even Get Out. 

I also think that both The Shape of Water and Dunkirk have equal amount of heart in them. The Shape of Water shows love in between two people while Dunkirk shows love for an entire country and is extremely poignant also.&&> technical mastery/athleticism or artistry/“heart.”

or playing to the judges (possibly the most important), according to I, Tonya&&I know. That is also one of the best directed films I've ever seen, it's been a heater of a year. I saw all three of those, and Last Jedi, more than once in theaters. I don't know if there's ever been a year where I even saw 2 movies twice in theaters. 

But I am not even holding my breath for 2049 getting the recognition it deserves. You can't expect 3,000 super old people to watch a 3 hour long depressing sci-fi movie, it's just not going to happen. The Post goes down a lot easier. &&The Blind Side _*cough*bullshit_&&Kind of like you are stranded on a beach waiting for death and when you do finally escape it doesn't change the fact that your country is still losing the war.&&It was a movie about escape. Are you mad Indiana Jones didn't punch the boulder to death after it chased him?&&Was it like Argo? Because that's how I felt about Argo. 

The tension in that movie was like a dramatic version of being late for a flight and trying to catch it, with two hours of build up to explain why you booked that flight.&&One of the few times I agree with this split. Direction was phenomenal, script needed work. He deserved the direction award even if the film wasn't his best.&&[deleted]&&If you think back to the beginning of the movie, they describe her as being an orphan who was found near a river (if I remember correctly). They also introduce the ""scars"" rather early on. My thinking was that she was drawn to the fish man knowing what she really was.&&Pacific Rim is just glowing monsters and neon city lights at night and it looks so good&&Or even? The Hellboys are fantastic movies.&&Sorry your comment is lacking in a sufficient number of Christin Nolantino mentions. Please try again.&&[deleted]&&Yeah, it's part of the charm imo as well.&&Yeah, true I suppose!&&This. Fucking this.

I'm not a big monster movie fan (I don't hate, just kinda eh), but love a good action movie. I just wanted to go see giant robots fight giant monsters and have it be fun and badass and something I could popcorn my way through and cheer sometimes.

I got everything I wanted out of that movie and the visuals were even better than I expected. How could you ask for more?&&Lots of people do, lots of people don't. /shrug.&&Oh man his version of Nihilous would be anazing.&&Abe Sapien Begins&&At first his insanity was profitable, he worked it into something at least semi palatable for the average person, but I believe that naturally as these things do it worsened with age. Where his thoughts used to be a beautiful macabre dance of artistic thought and insanity fluttering to a quick and intimate tango it is now a slow one-sided waltz of insanity dragging along a corpse that once held excitement but now shuffles along with only the faintest memory of it's beauty.&&twisting the racist themes of Lovecraft to reflect current society would be a really interesting exercise. Like maybe have the cults be ways the powerful exploit the misery and fear of the working class.&&I think he meant it was del Toro's first win, not a Mexican directors first win.&&Yeah, they released it so it coincided with the 40 year anniversary of the Detroit riots depicted in the film. And in November they announced they would re-release it in December for a ten city, 20-screen release to spark it up during award seasons. I guess the buzz died during the summer/autumn.&&TYSM for this comment &&Those are completely reasonable thoughts to have. But this movie sits firmly in the fantasy/fairy tale genre, which means that it's purpose isn't really to reflect accurately on real life. 

It's not really about the science of the fish monster. It's more of a coming of age story, but instead of a child coming of age, it's an adult learning to accept herself. 


It's not about the main character making good or bad decisions. It's about her making decisions that are true to herself, and coming to understand her self worth. 

When you analyze it in terms of reality, and in terms of physics, and in terms of rationality, you miss the point and the message entirely. 


Think of it as a fairy tale without the limitations of a strictly kiddie audience. &&> Why can't they just return it to the ocean right away? Why do they have to wait for the canal to fill up, the ocean is literally right there, just drop it there and move on.

This was a plot hole because it wasn’t explained why they can’t go to the ocean right away. 


> And filling up a room with water like that is literally impossible, the flow from the sink would have to be more than the flow of water out of the door (and floor), it was absolutely ridiculous.

This is **not** a plot hole. Choosing to believe a humanoid sea creature is possible but not choosing to believe a bathroom could fill with water is on *you*, not the writing. 

> The main character was stupid as hell and made bad decisions all the time (aggravating the antagonist for absolutely no reason when she was getting away scot-free, just randomly romancing the monster in public instead of hiding it, not returning it to the water when she was supposed to, and hiding the monster in her own apartment when she could easily be a suspect is also extremely stupid even borderline retarded as that is the first place they would look).

**None** of these are plot holes. They are called character flaws and are often times what keeps an audience engaged (e.g. why are they going into the spooky house) as it easily gets the audiences’ mind moving to construct ways out of the scenario. I’m not saying you must like the choices that were made for the character to do but plot holes they are not. 


> I had absolutely no sympathy for the incredibly dumb main character who repeatedly made bad decisions.

This is personal opinion and not a plot hole. 

I support your opinion to dislike or hate this or any movie but before you think your opinion matters in the world, at least have some level of understanding about that which you are upset about. 

Have a great day!

&&Ridley was nominated for the extraordinary reshoots he did. How he was able to seamlessly replace Spacey with Plummer in just six weeks before release is impressive. &&To me, the story structure, much of which is on the director. She did a great job making things intense and harrowing, but a movie needs balance and the occasional let-up. Obviously the story itself didn’t really allow for that, but it was just so nonstop brutal that it felt like racial torture porn to me, and while that’s powerful in the way that seeing graphic terrible photographs can be, it’s not powerful to me from a storytelling standpoint.

She’s still an incredible director, I just don’t think the true story served a good movie this time around, as much as I think it’s a story people should know about.&&You're right. The fight scenes in Lady Bird were really choppy and poorly edited.&&Not to mention, she goes 100% Spider-man in one section with her magic rope, which really looked weird. &&Directing isn't just ""shots.""

Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf are great but they're not delivering award-winning performances in a vacuum, with no guidance or...er, direction. &&From what I understand, the Best Screenplay award judges both the dialogue and story of a movie, while the Best Picture award judges everything in a movie with a focus on story as well (the screenplay award is more or less seen from a technical and literary standpoint whereas the Best Picture award is pretty much whichever movie the jury liked the most). The Best Director award, however, is all about execution. It's not about making the shots look cool or using grand setpieces and tracking shots. Direction is a job that links the screenplay to the final product and it's all about how the movie was brought to life. The director is supposed to bring out the best performances from the actors but he/she also acts as the interpreter of the script. In a way, the balance of the film is brought by the director. A good script can only go so far - a good director will do it justice on the screen. 

It's hard to explain the job of a director because it's not very clearly defined, but when a director has a strong presence on the screen and completely spearheads the project, you can *feel* it. Auteurs like Hitchcock and Kubrick amongst many others brought this brilliant cohesiveness to their films which wouldn't have worked with the same script and the same actors if it weren't for their direction. I'm not comparing Gerwig's direction in Lady Bird to Kubrick in terms of quality but I guess what I'm trying to say is that it was a very well executed and cohesive project albeit being very simple at its core. That, to me, shows excellence in directing. I felt the same way about Barry Jenkins and Damien Chazelle after watching Moonlight and La La Land last year.&&> This obsession of needing women for female led movies and black guys for movies led by black characters is stupid.

I always hated this. I get why studios do it but, I feel like it runs the risk of pigeonholing female and black directors into directing those types of movies. There is no reason they can't direct any type of blockbuster film. &&Honestly, I think most movie-goers wouldn't know about the term ""DCEU"" and I think the people who praise Wonder Woman for its empowering messages and its merit as a female-helmed movie don't fall into the same demographic as those who care about the interconnections of a cinematic universe that isn't Marvel. But I'm assuming a lot.

I definitely agree with you that directors should be chosen based on their qualifications, not the color of their skin or their gender. That's not to say that a black director might not have insight on the black experience that gives them the qualities necessary to direct a movie about a black character, but in a case like that the credentials have more to do with their life experiences and sensibilities than their demographic. &&It's easily the best DC movie since Nolan's Batman trilogy, and given how utterly trash that universe has been lately, I think people are desperate to cling onto any hope for the future of the franchise. When the whole armada is sinking, everyone looks to the one captain who's ship stays afloat.&&Also the casting of Ares. Just awful.&&It wasn't just the script. Gal Gadot is not a great actress and she wasn't well directed in WW at all. She looks like she's a runway model in every scene. She has too much confidence for the character's earliest moment as a superhero. It's almost like the movie was setting up her being dead wrong about Ares, getting Steve killed and then losing that confidence, kinda like one of the greek legends about hubris fucking everything up. It also could've set up a sequel set a few decades later where she's angry, which then could've tied into BvS and her nihilistic and cynical attitude when she's introduced, but no, we need a big ugly fight in our superhero movies even when it makes absolutely no sense.&&I've always found Best Director a weird award to give, because it's difficult to pinpoint a directors job. When you say it's the best directed DC film, what are you exactly referring to? (Genuinely curious, please do answer)

I've always felt that best director and best picture should be the same thing. It's the directors job to make a movie. Like it's an actors job to act or an editors job to edit. The director oversees the script, directs the actors, watches the editing. For that reason you could argue that the director was technically the reason an actor acted so well. Or even vice versa, that the director was terrible at directing the actors, but the actors were so talented they managed on their own. I believe the director should be judged on the final film as a whole piece of art. For that reason, I think the Best Picture category should be the same as the Best Director category.&&Heath Ledger won an oscar for The Dark Knight.&&Bingo&&I’ve been referred to as an SJW but I thought it was a pretty unfair gesture to whoever won the award. I was with the entire message/theme of the event until that. It only serves to discredit the winner, who was in this case one of the kindest and hardest working guys in the room.&&Sand 4-5 looks kinda Hispanic, and Sand 3-4 and Clay 2-3 look fairly Asian to me. Clay 3-4 and Clay 5-Earth 1 look vaguely Indian to me, too.

I heard somewhere that Africans have more genetic diversity than any other group of humans. At least from this picture, that appears to be the case.&&Majority of the public don't quite understand you can be a light skin Mexicano. People assume alot of times he's American or something. I know it surprised a friend of mine he had an accent &&In America, even if you’re light skinned, so long as your Mexican or some kind of Latin American nationality you’re basically considered as being of a wholly different race apart from “true” whites. &&Right&&Exactly this, thank you. &&Thank you, I was going to say this if nobody else had. A whole lot of people discussing this issue have ignored this aspect.&&> The larger point, which lots of people are missing, is not that women want participation trophies, we simply want the chance to participate. How many women Spielbergs and Nolans have been turned away at the outset because directing is a ""man's gig"" and they weren't taken seriously? 

Or have been harassed out of the industry? Kater Gordon won an Emmy before she was 30 and left the television industry because Matt Weiner harassed her out of it.&&3 hours too late :(&&Lol&&You didn't thank anyone! Now I regret giving the explanation in the first place.&&I only know because I look up so much trivia on the show, it's so completely out there, but that's also probably why the episode was the way it was! &&It has to win for cinematography. Deakins can't keep getting snubbed&&Yeah, that one is a head scratcher. I guess it’s still tough for sci-fi.&&Blade Runner 2049 is for my money, the most deserving movie there is. We will be talking about that long after we’ve forgotten about, say, Lady Bird. That’s not a shot at Lady Bird either, BR2049 is just one of those movies.


Also Edgar Wright is getting snubbed so badly for Baby Driver, which is another one I feel like we’ll be scratching our heads about years from now. This awards season has the feel of the “Forrest Gump over Pulp Fiction/Shawshank” class.&&Same bro. Something about it feels heavier or “bigger” than most movies. My favorite Nolan film is still The Prestige though.&&Interstellar made my heart hurt. It's one of my favorite movies and for me it's endlessly watchable especially the no time for caution scene with the soundtrack in the background, I'm never not tense during that scene.&&As a father with a very distant relationship with his daughter (and wishing it were a better relationship), the movie Interstellar has a unique capacity to break me down into a mess of tears every damn time.  I feel like I'm the one who is infinite miles away, pulling books and communicating in Morse code.

For me, Interstellar isn't really about space travel.  It's just a story about a father and a daughter and how it all goes wrong.  The ""trick"" is that they wrapped it in sci-fi just so they could get my nerdy ass into the theater to watch it.&&Ahh, thanks for the link. Also, for timestamping.&&The shape of water shows the love between Guillermo del Toro and Doug Jones, and it's beautiful &&I disagree with this quite a bit, every character is fairly developed with multiple motivations and explorations into who they are. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've seen in terms of developed characters in a very long time. 

[Strickland's character is shown to be a family man, kind when it's beneficial, while also a racist careerist. We see multiple conflicts within his story: the fingers, re-finding the creature, the desire and damage done to his Cadillac, and preserving his lifestyle, his desperation](#spoiler)

[Giles is an alcoholic who has lost his prominent stake within an ad firm. He's gay, and attempting to reconcile that within society. We see his character have a love story, get rejected, and recognize Elisa's love for the creature through the impossibility of his own dream to be loved. We also see his take on race relations kind of evolve, from ""turn off the TV about the protest"" to standing up against the racist pie counter operator.](#spoiler) 

[Zelda Fuller's character participates in a plot she doesn't believe in to help her friend. We learn so much about her through her monologues, and the pay off of finally seeing what her husband is like is great](#spoiler)

[Dr. Robert Hoffstetler's internal struggle over what to do with ""the asset,"" the fact that he's a spy, and who was willing to kill his handlers showed what his real values were. He scarified himself for the greater good.](#spoiler)


[The first, or one of the first, scenes with Elisa involves her masturbating, which is a rare portrayal on film: a person with a handicap being sexual. She's sensitive, a good listener, and the actress does a great job communicating her personality through her face and through the way she signs. She has a love story, it's an arc, and it's brave.](#spoiler)&&I'd argue that the characters in Shape of Water are very strong, likable, and memorable, but I haven't seen the films you've listed aside from Get Out. I felt that Get Out's strength wasn't in its characters, who were all fairly one-dimensional (which has purpose in the story) compared to the more rounded characters of Shape of Water. I also think comparing the two films would make for a very interesting essay or discussion, as they both tackle ideas of racism, societal norms and expectations, and stigmatization based on surface-level characteristics, but each film manages to comment on these issues in a different way. &&2049 should at least win any visual related awards. I had a 3 hr long eyegasm. It was so well done.  Dunkirk was not bad but not breathtaking either.&&Jokes on you, I'm always waiting for death.&&""Slate.  Why did it have to be slate.""&&This is reddit. You’re circle-jerking or downvoted. The docking scene in Interstellar was amazing and The Prestige is the best movie ever and you have to be above a certain IQ to understand Inception and I understood Memento on my first watch and The Dark Knight is the best batman movie of all time and did you know that for Interstellar Nolan personally planted and harvested 500 acres of strawberry trees? &&When the mech picked up the ship and used it like a baseball bat I blew a load in my pants. I loved that movie. &&God damn it Tim, I told you not to post here....&&Gotcha. Didn't read it like that. &&I never said it was about the science of the fish monster existing, I never brought that into question. The room filling with water is absolutely ridiculous considering it would need more water going out of the faucet than what was coming out of the doors to stay at the water level it was (impossibly) at.&&While that's definitely impressive, it doesn't excuse the opinion held by many that *Lady Bird* was a far better film deserving of a best director nomination. &&that's a solid critique that I don't have any issues with.

I guess I could say that most of the story structure is on the writer who pens the script, but you're right in that it's on the director's shoulders of what's prioritized and how it makes it to screen.

Sure you could have gotten deeper within the characters of the victims on the screen but I almost felt like not knowing that much about them was symbolic of how indiscriminate the police's actions were. it didn't matter who these people were or what their background was, they're going up against the wall just like anyone else would. They weren't special in the eyes of the cops, which was even more chilling. The story was that this was just another incident, in hundreds of similar incidents, that happened all the time. Because of that it's really easy to glance over them, but if you looked closely into any one of them you'd see just how brutal and disturbing they are.

fair points though&&ಠ_ಠ&&I think I saw the same CGI kick being used seven or eight times throughout Wonder Woman. It really took me out of it, because it wasn't just reusing something repeatedly, it was reusing something that was terrible the *first* time around.&&Excellent point. And it also explains Del Toro's win. When you watch that movie you get the real sense you're seeing *him* up there. Phenomenal performances, yes. But the color palette. The *mise en scene*. Even the understated score (Desplat also deserved his win). Altogether it all felt very ""Del Toro"" and the culmination of decades of craft and vision.

Lady Bird was a wonderful look inside Gerwig's head, just as Shape of Water was a look inside Del Toro's head. It's just Del Toro has the long experience necessary to pull off a truly fantastical vision, while Gerwig settles into realism. 

Both are fine ways to tell a story, but if we're awarding directorial achievement I'd give it to the person who *creates* a world, not just photographs it.&&I'm not saying its a bad movie. I just don't think it deserves that nomination compared to other directorial efforts. &&Not the casting, more of the reveal and just the fact it became a CGI-fest. I spotted him as Ares the moment he was on camera.

Jenkins was very responsible for that.&&David Thewlis plays a great Villain. See, Fargo S3. However, the god of war? Nah. 

David Thewlis as Hades, though... That I can get behind. &&Well good luck trying to sell a super hero movie without action. 

We might not like it but we need shit to keep people going to the movies. Or else it just fizzles out and we get nothing. &&The winner didn’t seem to mind. He did mind being played off at the end when he wasn’t done. &&Which seems weird to me. His name is Guillermo Del Toro. That's a very Spanish namr. Plus, Pan's Labyrinth is all in Spanish and is arguably one of his best movies and felt like it had more of what makes a GDT movie than any other until SoW&&The ""women are inferior but believe themselves to be equal"" circlejerk must be stopped! :)&&He’s definitely in the Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre, and if I remember correctly the episode where Maureen fully transitions into a cat (courtroom scene).&&Duuuude the prestige is awesome &&Memento is the one that really got me. Prestige, I feel like got lost in its Tesla plot.&&My family got together for Thanksgiving, after dinner my dad and uncle were debating which movie to watch so I suggested The Prestige. I was low-key excited cause they hadn't seen it and its like my favorite movie. Everybody but me was passed out by the 30 minute mark - I couldn't believe it. Now, to be fair, these were my aunts and uncles I'm talking about 55-65 year olds after a big meal but come the fuck on. In the morning, they all made fun of my movie selection and when they asked me which part about the movie made me like it so much, you know what I said?? I said dad go fuck yourself&&Have you watched Predestination?&&I never got the hype, Interstellar made my eyes roll if anything. I see that a lot of fathers seemed to like it so I'm sure they were able to connect with it far more than I could. &&That's exactly what it was.

I hope you two work things out, life is short and I'd give anything for my dad to want what you do.&&Shite. I hope it gets better for you (and her).&&I have an 11 year old daughter that lives with her mother kinda far away (6hr drive) that I only get to see a few times a year. Used to be her best friend and now shes going through a phase where it feels kinda like she hates me. I'm just going to chalk it up to hormones and keep plugging away and sending love. Hope you do the same bro. Good luck!&&Doug Jones is awesome lmao did you ever know about all the work he had to do in Pan's Labyrinth? Wild. Hope he starts to get more recognition&&If the world is fair 2049 wins it for cinematography &&I don't know what version of Dunkirk you saw but I sure found it breathtaking. Those two movies represent the opposite but equally impressive peaks of practical and visual effects. &&Not just an eyegasm, but also an eargasm. The audio in that movie, as well as Dunkirk, was phenomenal.&&Same &&Like an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?&&I agree; I was trying to explain why its being thrown around as if it should be nominated.&&I started laughing when he still had the mustache in the flash back &&So pretty much the direction of the ending lol. &&[deleted]&&Are you watching closely?&&Loved the part where he can't figure out if he's getting shot at or is the one doing the shooting&&I agree that Prestige lost ""it"" with Tesla.   I think the double fanservice of Tesla and Bowie blinds many to the loss of plot and movie world building after Tesla was introduced.

&&It is because you actually have to think and pay attention.  It still blows my mind people do not like these kinds of movies. &&Love both of the films both are so awesome. Predestination is underrated.&&He's awesome as Saru in Star Trek: Discovery.

Also, I loved the story about how David Hyde Pierce refused credit on Hellboy as the voice of Abe Sapien because he considered that Doug's body work made the character far more than his voice did.&&Deakins can't win, it's a rule.  Skyfall lost to effectively a CGI cartoon (Life of Pi).&&They crashed a fucking planed into the ocean to get a shot for Dunkirk (that they may or may not have even got because the camera might not have survived the crash/salt water, it fucking did) and it was awesome.&&Watching Dunkirk in IMAX was one of the most incredible, immersive, stressful, anxiety-inducing, and beautiful moments I've ever had at a movie.

I left the theatre in straight up awe that a movie could still surprise me like that.&&Username, uh, checks out?&&Ha! Good ol' Lupin.&&Did you see the film? The guy won for making a movie about white straight men in positions of power being awful, the diversity angle wasn't exactly subtle. Hard to see how anyone could think Del Toro of all people would be offended by this.&&I’ve probably watched that movie 50+ times on Netflix.  My poor wife.&&I didn't care much for Skyfall as a movie, but it absolutely deserved to win on its cinematography alone. There were some absolutely stunning shots throughout the movie, especially in the last act with all the fire.&&\#justicefordeakins&&Was crashing a plane into the ocean a part of their plan?&&I'm in two minds about a lot of the air-combat. The dedication and lack of use of CGI was amazing, but the shots from cameras mounted to the sides of aircraft that were *very blatantly* not what they were pretending to be really hurt the impact of the scene, and in a film as dedicated to being accurate as they were I'm surprised they didn't digitally alter them.

The crash scene was very well done though.&&Life, uh, finds a way &&The mustache suits him well!&&Yeah I seriously doubt he or any of the nominees were that offended. &&I just rebought it on 4K blu-ray.

I kind didn't get into season 4, but I like when hard workers with a funny low budget show get recognition.

I'm actually surprised the Always Sunny crew are not doing a new show or something with Netflix.&&[deleted]&&This looks really silly and I’m gonna watch it&&It’s gotta be fresh&&The trailer had me in stiches. I can't wait to see it and really hope they continue to work as a trio on future projects.

Any word on Kyle Newacheck though? Is he in the film or do some work for it?&&They should DEFINITELY refer to each other as their names.

Hope it lives up to the Workaholics name. Underrated show imho. Always thought it looked childish at first glance but watched it from the beginning and discovered a very funny show with mostly clever plots.&&Hopefully they can channel early Workaholics.

This sounds like 3/4 of ""Smart Guys"" with a 1/4 of ""Die Hard."" Sounds good to me!&&> Three friends are on the verge of getting their video game financed

Ooh yeah whatever doesn't sound too funn.... 

>when their benefactor is taken hostage by terrorists.

0_o 

This is exactly what I'd want from these guys.&&The trailer didn't mention anything about a video game.  It looks like they are hotel staff that try to intervene in a hostage situation.&&Perfect movie to bring back the Catherine Zeta Jones song.&&The terrorist should be the cool pedophile they met when they needed the vapetron 9000 &&Exactly what I wanted to hear.  That 4 man team is hysterical.&&how are the characters? are they basically playing their workaholics characters?&&I saw Anders drunk af in Downtown LA entering a karaoke bar. That dude gets red as a mother lover. The Workaholics guys have a coffee brand too. It's pretty good. &&Movies going to be so tight butthole &&Really glad to hear it, I love their comedy style on workaholics, but it seems that more often than not TV guys can't translate it well to movies. I can't wait to check this out.&&Are we talking early workaholics style which was good or later workaholics style which was not so good? &&Nooo question, how can a movie coming out in months be screened so much hype earlier last year. What's going on in the time between?&&I am hoping for full TBH.&&thanks for inviting me&&You are an amazing human thank you&&I'm really glad to read this!! Super excited as I love these three! &&i can't wait. they're good&&I cant wait!&&Excellent news&&Early Workaholics style comedy or new? &&I would have watched this without seeing that trailer, but the Shaggy scene has me completely sold at this point.  I love the 90s/early 2000s music they reference.  When they mentioned Seven Mary Three and their song ""Cumbersome"" on Workaholics, I was absolutely dying laughing.  &&Holy shit Damien Darhk as the bad guy? I'm sold.

edit: just looked up the release date. April 20 aka 4/20. Of course it is.

Is there anything he **hasn't** sung in?&&So basically it's Die Hard with the Workaholics crew. 100% sold.&&Its odd that the trailer doesnt really address the motive the description of the movie has about video game developers rescuing their benefactor.

The trailer makes it look more like waiters who just want to be recreate Die Hard.

I get that people have been upset with recent trailers giving too much away, but this trailer seems to have the opposite issue of not really addressing general struggle and motive of the story.&&Man, Blake is lookin like Willem Dafoe these days.&&It's on Hulu if you have that&&It's on Amazon Prime if you have that.&&It's on Crave&&Only fully torqued or not at all, no halfsies&&#bieberfan69&&Reminds me of in the show: ""Don't make me swing on you!""&&Thank you. &&This movie better treat Bill Paxton with the reverence and respect he deserves. Otherwise I'm gonna go all Vasquez on those motherfuckers.&&They're still making It's Always Sunny seasons.  

Kaitlin Olson has the Mick though, and Charlie Day gets plenty of movie roles.&&When I heard people ask them about doing a movie or different show, mac said something like ""People do movies to get away with things they couldn't put in the show. FX lets us do anything already, so I don't see that happening.""&&[deleted]&&I thought they replaced Blake with someone else&&I thought it was Alton Brown&&Agreed.  This is perfect as a Netflix movie.  I might have hesitated to pay to see it in a theater, but I'm absolutely going to give it a shot from my living room.  &&WARNING: there is soooo much full frontal Adam in this film!

""What's the question, Private.""

""How do I get outta this chicken-shit outfit?""&&Rip Bill Paxton.  Training day was actually a great show but I doubt it now.  &&When the actual Fuck did that happen? &&He was so great in Spaceballs. &&2, he also directed the episode before it where Shirley and her husband get remarried.&&That's the Jeff's Ego episode where [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTPIz4yXaqA) happens!&&He also directed the bulk of the Workaholics series I believe. And appeared in numerous episodes as the guys' drug dealer.&&He's also Karl, my favorite character from Workaholics. &&Also an episode of Parks & Rec, 3 episodes of Happy Endings and a Childish Gambino video, among other things.&&Community only credited writers when they were ""in charge"" for an episode. If you check the credits for any episode, they'll only have Dan and one or two people. If someone was listed as a writer, most likely they contributed to the entire season as part of the show's writers room. There are also some contributors that would be part of the writing process only occasionally, but didn't get a full episode (E.g. friends of Dan Harmon)

All writers for a season would contribute with pitches, outlining, scenes, dialog, etc. But one writer would be in charge of writing the actual screenplay and Dan would act as co-writer and editor.

If I remember right, the rationale for this was that writers can easily prove employment as a writer for a given show, but it's more difficult for them in their career to show quality of writing. This way, it's easier to show what it's like when the specific writer is in charge of the final product. It also gives the writer experience as ""head writer"" so they can put that on their resume too.

I don't know what it was towards the end of Workaholics. I heard they got kind of tired of playing those roles, but I don't know how true that is. I'm sure they'll definitely have at least some of  their usual style of comedy either way though.

It hurt to see it drop off at S3 and just be awful, I questioned why I even bothered watching a lot of times but was hopeful an odd great episode would come along.

They went from nostalgic 90s jokes that I appreciated the hell out of to shock humor and trying to be gross. I just don't think gross stuff is all that funny though, at least not how they did it. At times I wasn't sure if they were even TRYING to be funny but rather just trying to be gross

.. And it wasn't even all that gross or shocking because we all see shit a million times worse than that online regularly. &&I think he meant Popstar. &&Just watched a clip since I've never seen it.

'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3' To Be Released In 2020,32883,7q991k,http://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/01/14/guardians-3-release-date/,1707,1515897890.0,,"2020 is only 2 years away...my how far we come.&&3 year cycle, 3 movies, 6 year trilogy franchise. Not surprised.&&I wonder what songs they will have this time around. I also wonder if they'll have any older music in Infinity War. &&Does it throw anyone else off when things are announced for 2020? 
My first reaction is ""wow, that's so far away.""
Until I realize 2008 was 10 years ago and I am old&&I wonder what the team will look like by then. &&This time with 8 post credit scenes!&&While watching Vol 2. all I could think about was how it was EXACTLY like the Futurama episode ""A Bicyclops Built For Two"".

[Here is an article about it for those interested](https://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/notice-massive-similarities-gotg2-classic-episode-futurama-586787)&&So we're getting 4 straight years of movies that feature the Guardians of the Galaxy. Noice&&Great, so will get to see Guardians of the Galaxy every year until 2020.

- 2017 - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

- 2018 - Avengers: Infinity War - Part One

- 2019 - Avengers: Infinity War - Part Two

- 2020 - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3





&&I still remember going into that theater thinking the movie would suck only to have my mind blown. Now GoTG is one of my all-time favorite films. &&I loved the first two. Excited to see Adam Warlock. &&Lets hope the comedic qualities of the first one aren't further watered down in the 3rd installment. Part 2 tried way too hard to be funny.&&Wow ! Hearing 2020 makes me feel like it's the future with the flying cars and stuff, but it's actually in 2 years  !&&By the time it gets to volume 10, it's gonna be REALLY loud.&&I do wonder if Batista will be starring if it's in 2020. He's supposedly in discussions with the WWE to return full time to the ring. &&A two year wait for Warlock. I’m still saddened that he won’t be in Infinity War.&&So excited for another one of these RISKY **Marvel** *masterpieces* from auteur genius James Gunn. 

Volume 2 was by far the greatest cinematic experience of 2017 behind Star Wars. I only saw 5 films last year but my taste is fine, and I *know* good movies. 

I *adored* Volume 2. I absolutely loved how literally every scene was either exposition or a joke. And I also **cherished** how the characters would laugh at their own jokes, letting me know when I should laugh. Laughing with characters is so FUN and that's what I want from these movies. I just want FUN and SPACE and please put more NOSTALGIA inducing music in there. 

Oh fuck me, James Gunn, straddle my fucking body and whisper those quips into my moist, sweaty ears. I want to experience your genius first hand. 

So psyched for this! &&Maybe Dave can move onto WWE for a bit before returning for Vol. 3&&It might be good, but I can't confirm because I don't have 2020 vision&&After Guardians Of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I don't have high hopes for the third one. 
Hope they'll focus more on story than jokes all the time&&As much as I loved GotG...the 2nd one just wasn’t very good. I’m all for the jokes, but turning Drax into well, whatever he is just doesn’t sit well with me&&Guess we know they survive infinity war&&Shoulda called it ""Guardians of the Galaxy.Mp3"" &&I hate it when they reveal a film will be out in several years time like seriously yeah it’s good news but at the same time I’ll start caring in 2020

&&I really hope they do a nova movie. Maybe like a buddy cop movie in the marvel universe. People already liked bright, plus they already have John c rieilly in corps. After thanos why not an annihilation arc? People want more guardians too. &&Can't wait for that soundtrack &&1 was fantastic, 2 was also pretty good, I'm cautiously optimistic.&&Screw the release date.  

GIVE US THE MIX TAPE NOW!&&I didn't really feel that the second was as good as the first, it just used the same premise of feeling disconnected and making a connection over and over in a very haphazard and rough way.  Hope for the best though for the third one, but it'll probably never be as good as the first one.&&I have famously huge turds! &&This is not news. James Gunn already confirmed this when Vol. 2 came out.&&I literally watched part II today with my daughter and her friends. Great movie so keep em coming&&I really liked Vol. 1 and I really disliked Vol. 2. Not sure if I'm gonna watch this one.&&So is he gonna bang her finally?&&In other news Water is Wet. &&Let’s hope it’s better than 2. 2 was painful. Gomorrah’s storyline had literally nothing going on, so making her angry at everything was supposed to stand in for that; it never does though. &&I can already feel myself inevitably not liking these movies anymore.&&Loved the first, hated the second, not excited for the third.&&https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/

James did Q&A on twitter.&&1 is still my favorite mcu movie by far, 2 was pretty decent to me as well, il patiently wait for 3&&Loved the first one and enjoyed the second but they need to slow down with trying to do a joke every line. &&That’s the threshold of ‘the future’.&&The roaring '20s we'll call it!&&Smash Mouth was right. 

The years keep coming and they don’t stop coming. &&That was what stook me too.

I remember a time when reading some news about something happening by the year 2020 would mean the same as ""some point in the distant future"" or ""to far away to worry or care about now"" or ""long after everyone saying this has retired"" or just ""never"".

Today it just means a two years from now.

&&Yeah time flies when you're dying inside. I feel like Reddit is the safest place to make this joke&&Only 102 years until Phil Diffy and his family are stuck in 2004.&&[deleted]&&isn't pratt done with the movies after the 3rd?&&3 movies? There'll be a 4th.&&They likely will for one or two scenes.
Or maybe since they might go to earth Peter learns about more modern music (maybe finds one that he likes or maybe makes a joke trashing it, idk).&&No older songs... He gets a zune at the end of gotg 2...&&I really hope all the songs are 90s/early 2000s, befitting stuff that would realistically be on a Zune. Like, Brittany Spears, N'Sync, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, that type of music. Just imagine a fight scene set to ""Hit Me Baby One More Time""!&&I hope they still have some 80s songs, because me and my dad loves the soundtrack, and they were what made my dad want to see the 2nd one in the cinema. &&Yeah. As an 80's kid, 2018 used to be a date in science fiction movies. Now it's just a regular boring sunday. Where are my goddamn spaceships and aliens. &&Avatar may even be released any year now&&Terminator 2 set The date of judgment day in the future.  August 29, 1997.  We are 21 YEARS past that “future”.&&Similar but I was old in 2008.  Now I'm fucking old.&&It'd be hilarious if Gunn didn't use the current team and did an old school Guardians with the Ravagers from the end of Guardians Vol 2&&Warlock can't wait&&I know it won't happen, but for some reason I want spidey on it, since we won't get agent venom for some time.

And add Nova (Richard rider) &&I liked that. Reminded me of the days Pixar used to play animated blooper reels during the credits.&&You mean 80 Easter egg scenes with staff credit&&They just have another movie play after the credits&&[deleted]&&TIL that the Futurama episode ""A Bicyclops Built For Two"" isn't the one where Bender dates the ship and sings ""A Bicycle Built For Two""&&I just watched both movies for the first time. Really dug them, but you're totally right. I instantly had the same thought and was just waiting for something to go south. &&Like most internet articles these days, it purposefully shifts things a bit and words things to further its point. It's not as close fitting as the article implies, just the idea of a shapeshifter leading a main character back to their world to live together is the same. 

Also, the plot of the movie is based on a comic run. &&Joe.ie,no thanks 🤢&&We will have 9 straight years of movies that _feature_  Captain America. Cap1, Avengers, Thor2 (cameo), Cap2, Avengers2, Cap3, Homecoming (cameo), Infinity War 1 and 2.  &&Kinda like when we were getting RDJ all the time!&&>2019 - Avengers: Infinity War - Part Two

Wait, I thought Infinity War was now just one movie? &&How many avengers movies is there going o be? Seams like a lot.&&I cant even remember why I went to see GotG. Never heard of it before, but damn was it good.&&I was nervous because I really loved the Guardians of The Galaxy comics (barely could find anyone to talk about them), I was just wishing it wasn't bad but by the time the title came up I was already sure it was going to be a good time.&&Same! I remember seeing the trailer and leaning over to my girlfriend whispering “aww man, I guess marvel is gonna start it’s decline now...”.

I have never been so wrong.&&Never really got into the MCU, I've seen most of the movies, and was entertained by each one, but was mostly meh... good action flix, don't really get all the intertwined story lines, and dont really care.

Then one night I had a fight with my wife and went to the cheap theater to escape a bit.  What's this Guardians of the Galaxy?  A talking racoon? Sure, why not, its 3 bucks, cant go wrong.  I was blown away. A little Star Wars, a bit of Indiana Jones, and a lot of awesome!  Definitely one of my all time favs.  I couldn't wait for Vol 2, and I wasn't disappointed.  So here's to Vol 3, and in the meantime at least there's Infinity War.
&&I remember saying “no” to another live action CGI talking animal, but my mind too, was blown.&&Same thing happened with Ant-man too. 

One of the least liked heroes in the original Avengers roster, couldn't imagine they'd turn it into comedy-gold-Ironman.&&Second kind of disappointed me, personally, but the first is a classic in my book.&&It was just corny. Avengers 2 was like that too.&&As long as not every single dramatic moment isn’t undercut by humour I’ll be happy. A film based on constant quips doesn’t hold up on rewatches IMO.&&>  tried way too hard

Maybe it is just me being an old guy, but it is weird how over the last several years the idea of ""trying hard"" has been turned into a huge insult.  All of these movies ""try hard"" to be funny.  It isn't like people are writing movies with budgets in the 9 figures and not trying.  If you want to insult the movie say it wasn't funny, don't insult it for trying to be the thing you wanted it to be.&&it was the after school special kind of tender moments that every pair of characters had that felt blatant and just...easy. besides those moments (the groot and racoon, lord and gamora, gamora and sister, etc.) it was fun and enjoybale. 

hope they tone down that ""we're all family and love each other!"" feeling the next one. still, fun visuals and colors, and ultimately a great popcorn flick.  &&This isn't a guardians of the galaxy thing.

This is a marvel/disney/every single other mainstream movie today thing.

Its horrible.&&I doubt it the dude is pretty serious about becoming a real actor. He did a good job in BR2049.&&I see we've found u/THE_OFFICE_BLOWS's alt account.&&As much as I enjoyed the Vol 2, totally agree with what you wrote.

But you really should check out Gunn's twitter page for more golden gems. &&>greatest cinematic experience of 2017 **behind Star Wars**

lol amazing.&&Yeah Vol. 2 at times feels REALLY forced like it just knows it's doing the same shit again and sort of hates itself for it. 

It's like that person you keep having sex with because it's familiar and reminds you of old better times but you know all the passion has sort of worn out and you're just going through the motions.

 I really like Gunn as a film maker. Vol. 1 is delightful and so is Slither and the madness of Super is sort of fascinating. 

I honestly think he should walk away now and go do something else completely while he's still ahead. Go make a weird indie film, let things settle then come back and have your film of choice.

He won't though because there's a dump truck full of money backing up into his driveway as I type this and I can't blame him for that.

Edit: Also moist sweaty ears is a brilliant line. Hope you tell your grandkids about that one one day.&&but had you find the god in the end?&&Hmm, I'm beginning to think you may be being facetious.&&Meh I get that this is a joke but the music is definitely not nostalgic in this one. The first one, FOR SURE. The music in the second one was far less mainstream especially to modern audiences.

Edit: I want to add that the music in he second one fits a lot better in the movie and per scene.&&This was funny. Haters be damned. &&I am surprised you haven’t been downvoted to hell because this sub shuns any marvel criticism. Maybe r/movies doesn’t get sarcasm and actually agrees with what you wrote. &&I read this in Mike's voice from redlettermedia. It felt like their sarcastic and cynical type of humor.&&i think i found my favorite account&&Kevin Smith? Is that you? &&I know you're just memeing but did this sub really hate Guardians 2? I thought it was awesome and hilarious. &&Fuck you, man, Slither is an amazing film. &&I have no problem with characters laughing at jokes. ""Characters don't laugh when something funny happens"" is something we've all just kind of accepted, but it is weird.&&Username makes this comment more funny.&&Characters shouldn’t laugh at jokes???

It’s weird as hell when someone says / does something funny and nobody on screen reacts&&that would be generous of him to throw them a bone, seeing how the last return was handled&&A4 just finished filming. Filming for Guardians 3 most likely starts later this year, or next year. I don't think he's gonna have much time for WWE.&&not for sure. GOTG vol. 2 took place in 2014, so vol.3 could take place before IW&&No one survives infinity war except ant man&&I’m actually surprised to see so many people with your opinion. I liked both of them but I actually liked the 2nd one better because i felt like it made me feel something a little more.

Probably the father-son dynamic.

My dad wasn’t doing too well (cancer) when the movie came out and so the whole ‘father’ arc kind of hit me harder than it probably normally would’ve. &&Weird. I liked the 2nd one better. It was actually quite touching in the end.&&That's not what info wars says&&I didn't like them pairing her with Starlord. I still remember when Tony Stark banged her, and even that womanizer couldn't make a dent and left her unsatisfied. I don't see Starlord doing any better.&&Weird, I love both for wildly different reasons. The first had the humour, which intermingled with the brilliant script and didn't alter the tone. The second had the emotion and character we didn't have in the first one, as well as one of the better villains of the MCU. Both have great soundtracks and it's hard for me to choose a favourite (it's probably 1 because the humour works better).&&For Disney it really is:
New Star Wars movies finished.

Original Avengers roster  of the MCU most likely finished (Iron Man, Cap, Thor, GotG).

All conceivable Pixar sequels milked out (Dory, Incredibles, Toy Story).

Disney Live Action remade all the biggest hits (BatB, Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin. What else is possible? Ariel is unlikely. Other property not popular enough).&&I once thought that about 2000, but now it seems like a distant memory. &&You know, it's funny. I've always considered 2020 to be the start of another large leap in technology and idk why. Maybe it's because so much sci-fi and other media take place in the 2020s, maybe it's because ""we'll have people on Mars by 2022"" and ""we'll have cyborg limbs by 2026"" or something like that. &&Shh bb is ok 😘&&Thor may get a 4th movie and beat them all.&&I'm pretty sure Spidey is the one who's gonna have the most profitable franchise. 

His first MCU movie made almost 900M. Spidey has a ton of villains and stories to work with which means more movies. And Marvel will most likely give him **at least** 5 movies, if Sony extends the contract past 3 solo movies, which they'll do if each movie continues to make this much. I predict that by the time Spidey's 5th MCU movie gets out of cinemas, Sony would have earn around 4-5 billion dollars. &&[deleted]&&To give iron man more credit, it was the movie that started it all&&Those numbers are revenues rather than profits, right?&&Possibly an interaction with Strange and Quill about music knowledge too.&&Hes got a Zune, now, so presumably some newer music? &&I think he’ll listen to Mouse Rat while on earth.&&I hope he doesn't make a ""back in my day"" joke. I hate it when  people think that today's music is bad, heartless, or talentless compared to classic stuff.&&he’ll get rick rolled by Tony, but won’t understand that it’s a joke.  he’ll just think the song is fucking awesome.

and then Cap in the background just shakes his head saying, “even i understood that reference”.&&The Zune could have been from like 2004&&I know but that song he listened to at the end was pretty old so maybe there's a few in the 299 other songs. 

Edit: heres a link to the song https://youtu.be/leC5WE7P2To&&You can put older songs in on a zune. It depends on the taste of the user. &&While it'd be cool to have those, it would definitely be cool to throw some 90s alternative in there. Gimme some RHCP and Nirvana! &&Captain Marvel is gonna be set in the 90's so they could be saving some 90's music for that instead.&&>Where are my goddamn spaceships and aliens. 

Mate, you're gonna have to wait until 2020 like the rest of us.
&&90's kid, but I still remember watching the original Transformers movie, and it's set in 2005, and I think that was the year I watched it.&&Hell, I was born in '86 and even the year 2000 seemed like the distant future when I was in grade school. Before that, 2001 was the title of a freaking sci-fi novel and movie. 2018 was like crazy futuristic where there would definitely be flying cars, all of New York and L.A would be prison colonies, the world would be one big trash heap, people living in space, etc.&&I believe blade runner was set in 2016. In that movie humans have conscious A.I.s and multiple other inhabited world's. And the first Alien was set in 2038 if I remember correctly before it was retconned.&&[deleted]&&I think Gunn said that the current lineup's last act together will be Vol 3.&&you're being sarcastic, right? Because he's doing exactly what you said also.&&It's gonna feel so weird having Adam introduced AFTER Thanos has been dealt with.  

It'd be like introducing Batman after Joker's death. :(&&Was that the one where they literally explained: ""In the movie this happened, but that wouldn't have been a good end to a game so here is a giant agent smith to fight""&&*Love and Rocket* with Sigourney Weaver? Now that’s a top tier classic episode, although I thought the B-plot with Fry and Leela was better than the Bender plot that episode.&&You’re thinking of “Love and Rocket”, which the title coincidentally is based off of “Love and Marriage”, a song played at the beginning of sitcom “Married With Children” which is referenced in the episode “A Bicyclops Built for Two”. I may or may not watch too much Futurama...&&I also thought it was that episode.&&The ""bicycle built for two"" song is a reference to the film 2001: a space odyssey and is further a reference to the IBM 704 at bell labs that could famously sing the song.&&To be fair, everybody knows something is going to go south. Otherwise, it would be a pretty boring movie without a plot. &&JUST that? What about shape shifting just to have sex with various species. That is pretty specific. &&It says the team comes together to defeat alcazar,  but that’s not true.  Leela and the other brides beat his ass.&&> starring

> cameo&&I hope he's the bad guy in Spiderman: Graduation (2 or 3).  

Caps' in town taking down hydra or something, and Peter sees it as an opportunity to ""prove himself"" by bringing in the war criminal.  Peter and Cap have a chat after he ""catches"" him and they go punch space-hitler in the face. &&He's the ""main"" character of the MCU, so it makes sense.&&Yeah I just wrote it as that as there is no official title for the Avengers 4 yet. &&It is. The idea of Infinity War being split up into two movies was discarded a while ago. The third Avengers movie is obviously called Infinity War. The fourth Avengers movie, we don’t know yet. But it’s not a “part two”.

Edit: I suggest some of you guys check out Wikipedia and the sources mentioned there.&&It is, there won't be any infinity war 2, but there'll be a definite 'sequel to it' &&I went cause of Chris Pratt. I’m a huge fan of parks and rec, and the thought of Andy as a superhero was hilarious to me. &&I went just because it was part of mcu. And I was like

Well They are gonna be in the infinity war movie. Better see how the look and sound. And what back story they have gone with. 

Came out after seeing it like.. I want it to be 

Gaudians of the galaxy :infinity war. feat the avengers.&&Yeah, I think everyone was thinking the same thing. ""Marvel's really reaching deep into the bag for new characters, huh?""&&The second swings wildly in different directions, because the story is more complex and emotional, but the humor and dialogue are *so* shallow that it’s often hard to find the substance of the story. &&Second one tried so hard with those little one liner corny jokes. Like way too many of them&&It improved a lot for me on my second watch (it’s on Canadian Netflix now). I think I went into it the first time expecting way too much - but rewatching it a second time, I enjoyed EVERYTHING (the music, jokes, dialogue, story, character interactions) so much more. Highly recommend a second watch&&Same here, I just think my expectations were way too high for the second one.&&The worst part was they ruined Ultron.

Yes I know he was supposed to be like a bastard child of Tony Stark which is why he was written the way he was. Doesn’t make me have to like it. The tone of the first trailer for Avengers 2 was perfect. &&I wouldn't say corny. It felt goofy most of the time - especially with Drax or whatever. I think it was meant to appeal to kids more; maybr for more toy sales.&&Then how can you watch any post-Avengers MCU films?&&Star wars last jedi anyone?&&That's the biggest problem with The Last Jedi IMO.&&Fellow semi-old guy. What the youths are referring to with try hard is more similar to what we use to call ‘forcing it’. Or for the even older crowd shoehorn.&&Someone saying ""trying too hard"" is synonymous with ""not knowing when to stop.""&&Well, the problem is that comedy should be natural. The first Guardians film nailed the tone perfectly. The second movie was joke after joke after joke, many of them misplaced, jammed into the scene.. It was overkill. It didn't need to be funnier, it just needed to tell a different story than the first with the same characters. We didn't need anything added in the way of comedy. &&Star Wars....

So much “laughter” in the last Jedi, 5 minutes into the film, I literally said “I am laughing way too much for a red titled Star Wars film”. &&According to Dave Meltzer, he's also pretty serious about wanting to do one final run with WWE for six months to a year before retiring from wrestling for good.

Honestly, I'm completely expecting to see him back in WWE sometime soon. Possibly at the Royal Rumble at the end of the month. And if he does come back now, I believe he'd still have time to film GotG 3.&&Bears, Beets, Battleworld Gamorica&&Gunn's Twitter page is my homepage. I love opening my browser and watching him masterfully shut down anyone who dares to speak against his instant classics. I love how he has to explain things on his Twitter that should've been explained in the film itself. He really is taking film making to the next level. &&I wish I had a relatable “that person you keep having sex with because it's familiar”

haha i agree with what you said, it’s well written! &&Yea it's like the took the aspects people enjoyed from the first one, turned it up to 11, and filled vol 2 with it. The little arrow thingy going all over the place was a prime example of that. In the first one, it was a really awesome short scene. It's easy to see in this one how they were like 'man, people really liked that. How long/ridiculous can we make this scene?! Because if they like *that* they will LOVE *this*!&&I actually greatly preferred the music in Volume 2. Mr. Blue Sky is a great song to open the movie with and Father and Son hit me really hard at the end of the film, probably harder than any other Marvel movie thus far has. The song they played when Yondu did his arrow rampage is also really quite the earworm.&&I guess the music may not be nostalgic, but I'm incredibly glad they chose the songs they did.
This Christmas season was pretty hard for me, and Vol. 2's album really helped me get through it. (Especially Mr. Blue Sky).&&> I am surprised you haven’t been downvoted to hell because this sub shuns any marvel criticism

they cant tell that its satire, they only understand quips!&&>this sub shuns any marvel criticism.

It really doesn't, have you seen any discussions of Age of Ultron?&&Here's my Marvel criticism:

The Netflix series are all around rewarding but are all at times like watching paint dry or grass grow. All of those shows could benefit from either filler being added to the dragged out storyline or by being cut down to only 8 episodes. 

Although they should have taken one look at the script for The Defenders and thrown it in the trash. So lackluster.&&Hate is a strong word. I think some people just found it to be rather disappointing since the first one set quite a bar. &&""You're being really negative!""
""WELL IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF DAY!""&&Characters can do whatever they want as long as it's in moderation. Drax constantly laughs at his own jokes, Rocket spends about 3 minutes laughing at ""Taserface"". It was a poorly written film, with terrible comedy and the laughter from these characters came off as insecure. It's as if Gunn couldn't write a funny enough joke so he inserted what was effectively a laugh track to elicit laughter from the audience. It was lazy and overused and annoying. &&Yeah I thought the characters (except Drax) felt better written this time around. I didn't realize r/movies hated this movie but I prefer it over the first. &&I actually really hope her and Tony have a “moment” of some sort in Infinity War, just as a little nod to that storyline. &&You can bet your sweet ass that they will be doing Little Mermaid. They are doing Dumbo for fuck's sake.&&What about Mulan?

Wait wait wait - there's an Aladdin live action remake?&&> Disney Live Action remade all the biggest hits

Mate, they haven't even crossed them over to establish the Kingdom Hearts Cinematic Universe yet&&Half of the Disney animated canon has been announced for development even stuff like Sword in the Stone and Disney even got the rights for Chronicles of Prydain, the books Black Caulron is based on. There will be plenty more of these films. And Disney can just make Disney princess Avengers style film or just Kingdom of Hearts films with these characters if the feel they need more event films.&&Disney is behind A Wrinkle in Time, so I wouldn't be surprised if they start optioning other kids books. I'd love to see ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" done (again) as a feature film, for example.&&Better bring Waititi back if they do. Phenomenal director&&Guardians will probably get more than three movies considering they can switch the cast around as easily as they can the Avengers.&&We might get more Captain America movies, just with Bucky as Cap.&&I definitely think Thor will end up with another movie soon. Ragnarok, though it is literally The End, also felt like a new beginning. And there's no way Marvel would want to sever all ties with Taika Waititi now.

I do think the film would be less Thor-centric though. It'd be more along the lines of Thor and the Mighty Valkyries or something like that. &&I think he gets one more before being replaced by a new 9 year old spidey.&&That is assuming that Sony's ego doesn't go through an inflation and they start thinking that they can successfully make the Spider-man films on their own.&&""Lately""&&They have made almost **15 BILLION** dollars.

"" WE'RE ALL GONNA LOOK LIKE BURNT OUT TOASTER OVENS ""&&Yep. He said this will be the last movie with the current lineup of Guardians and that it will set up the next 10  to 20 years of Marvel movies.&&Damn so I guess it'll probably be a bit darker than the last two then.&&You are thinking of the video Path of Neo. Matrix Revolutions is the third and final film in the Matrix trilogy.&&[deleted]&&Fixed. &&> I hope he's the bad guy in Spiderman: Graduation (2 or 3). 

""What do you mean I can't break the law? That is exactly what you have been doing""


""That's...different""&&Well, there is an official title, but they say they can't tell us because the title itself is a spoiler for Infinity War. &&Wait so Avengers 4 is coming immediately one year after 3?&&Probably the title of 4 will spoil some of the outcome of 3, maybe that’s why they are keeping it under wraps.&&Yes it is. 10 years of movies leading to Thanos only to have him for one movie ? He probably won't complete the Infinity Gauntlet until the end of Infinity War.

It's part 2, just different title. &&It will be a 'Part Two' in all but name. There's just no reason to have the filming schedule they've had unless that's true.&&The internet did a collective ""Wut?"" when they announced it. Comic book fans either barely knew/cared about the comic or they didn't know they existed. Then Marvel comes in and swoops up nearly 800 million dollars. At this point, I've got no reason to doubt anything they do. They keep making (at minimum) extremely watchable films with some home runs every so often. &&I dunno man, i might be very optimistic, but when it was first announced I was hyped. I like space adventures, which It looked like, and rocket isn't any weirder than chewie. 

Then again I knew a bit about the guardians from the comics, and some games. &&YES. Thank you for putting into words the feelings I had about that movie.

The overarching plot was surprisingly deep but there were just so many moments of comedic relief that I could never get invested into it. &&I dont get why so many commenters on reddit dont like this kind of humour.

Dont get me wrong you can like and dislike whatever you wish, im just wondering why a lot of threads and comments call shows and movies with light simple humour ""not that great"". Not everything must be totally deep.

I enjoyed my time with both movies, they were kinda action-y, superhero-y and just fun. But then i go to reddit and see people complaining that the second is so much worse than the first etc.

Isnt it ok to just say ""i disliked it because it didnt have my kind of humour"" instead of saying ""the humour was bad"".

Different people like different things after all :/&&it tried too hard to be funny and it didnt come naturally.&&Yes, too many of them. I don't mind the odd one as that was the tone of the first movie which got it right. The second one had every line turned into a joke.&&ahhh, my nipples!


Who can hate this?&&Trailer for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeOjFno6Do  
  
I also liked this trailer. Was hoping for a very dark movie. Ultron just full blown ruthless and cold. &&ultron never felt powerful which was the real problem. Sure he beat up iron man a bit, but when all the avengers fought him he just summoned his army and then got shafted. He never really seemed like a big bad. Also the fact that a lot of the plot points were similar to Avengers 1 was a problem for me. &&It's pretty clear by now that every Marvel movie will be full of jokes and comedy. I mean Thor Ragnarok is basically a full blown comedy while dealing with the death of Thor's father, the occupation and destruction of Asgard and such... Also Thor has become stand-up comedian during his quest about Ragnarok apparently while he was pretty serious before... 

At this point, I fully assume Infinity War will be a comedy too. Civil War is the only movie that kind of isn't (still having plenty of comedic moments).

Marvel movies are just action comedies basically, it's like that since the first Iron Man, there was really no surprise that Avengers 2 wasn't all drama and serious.&&Yeah Ultron sucked. Like, Jesus, even the robot is quippy and sarcastic? And something that's annoyed me since the first trailer WHY DOES HE HAVE A MOUTH?&&I don't like Drax in Gotg 2, most of his ""funny"" lines weren't funny at all&&Ironically, none of serious moments in Spider-Man Homecoming were undercut with a joke or quib, which you'd expect coming from that character more so than anyone in the entirety of Marvel comics, period, not just the MCU.&&Winter Soldier would like a word with you.&&Really? Because all I could see is forced laughter.

The amount of random camera cutting they did to something funny/not related.

They could have swapped the light sabers for light guns and called it guardian of the galaxy.&&6 months to a year is like a winners lap.  He will get offered a stupid amount of money to perform for them as one of their biggest stars again and be able to decide what he wants to do after that.

  Not many wrestlers get that chance.&&Bears can climb faster than they can run you know.&&> I love how he has to explain things on his Twitter that should've been explained in the film itself. 

Is that what they mean by 4d?&&How do I subscribe?&&Lol, you keep at it .&&Every scene was like that, three times longer than it needed to be, set to 70s music. It reminded me of Heavy Metal/Heavy Metal 2000, like listening to music was more important than pacing.&&Come a Little Bit Closer! I really wish they'd release the movie version with the full choir on the last chorus.&&The music was much more meaningful in the second. The first one was all about cramming in as many identifiable songs as possible, but the second was about integrating the themes of the songs with the themes of the movie. It felt like a damn musical and even made an overture out of Brandy. It's delightful to hear that song and how uplifting it sounds only to have it slowly warp into its darker themes until it culminates on being the motivation for Peter's mother's death.&&Yeah Mr. Blue Sky is the one where I would say is nostalgia.&&Is that actually what's going on, a bunch of English as a second language people are thinking that this is a positive comment.
Because I too am surprised to see a marvel diss this highly upvoted &&The Defenders was so bad it made me have an existential schism and analyze exactly how many hours of Marvel Netflix I've watched versus what they deliver in their stories, and I realized it was all a fucking waste.

There were some good parts in there, sure -- but at the cost of 86 episodes, 57 hours of continuous television?&&My easy-going nature is getting sorely fuckin' tested.&&You actually think Drax's laughing is to let the audience know when to laugh? His laughing *is* the punch line. He has poor social skills and doesn't realize it's not okay to laugh about people's insecurities.

Feel free to criticize *that* but you clearly don't understand a lot of things.&&That would be fun :)&&Wasn’t Chloe Grace Moretz attached to the live actio Little Mermaid film until she decided to take a break from making films?&&I'm ecstatic for what Tim Burton is going to bring to Dumbo. &&They are doing it. Lin Manuel Miranda is working on it, but he said he isn't doing the score just ""making sure the classic is respected"" or something. He's a big fan of the original.&&Yes and Will Smith is the genie.&&Oh god. I’ll have you to blame when this becomes reality.&&Favourite director! Watched Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What we do in the shadows, so I can't wait to see what he has done with Ragnarok. Really pleases me to see someone from my home town doing indie national stuff to inevitably get something like Thor.&&They wouldn’t not, not at this point &&I'm pretty sure if they do 4 he's a guarantee. &&Pair up Waititi with Reynolds for Deadpool 3.&&It better be centered around Beta Ray Bill taking on Thor. Bonus points if Mjolnir's fate isn't resolved in the Thanos movies and is focused on here.&&They'd change the name or atleast the naming convention of ""vol 2/3/4"".

Ticket sales will hurt when it sounds like the 7th movie in a series.&&I don't think I'm ready to lose the real Cap yet&&They'd be killing the Cap movie franchise if they did that. Replacement Captain Americas never work out in the comics.&&That's just speculation. There is no evidence that it will happen and it doesn't have to. In case of Thor, Waititi and Hemsworth expressed their wish for another movie. Similar to Black Widow movie where there are actual things happening now. Not just empty speculation.&&Uuugh I know it goes that way in the comics but damn I'm sick of Bucky. Kinda hoping they switch things up and kill him instead of cap&&Most likely Thor 4 would co-star Beta Ray Bill.  I think he was originally supposed to appear in Thor 3 but they cut him because the role was really small and they wanted to introduce him properly.  That way they could end the Thor story but still keep The Asgard and other realms story.&&Who could be a Thor villain now we used most of them up ?&&Spider Kid!

No he can't

He's still a kid.

&&I get one of the core character traits of Parker is his youth, and that the constant recasts are at least partly in an attempt to keep that true, but I would personally enjoy seeing Parker grow up with his gifts in the movie realm. The Raimi trilogy headed that way a little bit, but didn't get super far before it went off the rails.&&Spider toddler is the most exciting and adorable Spiderman by far&&They already mentioned Miles in Homecoming. I'm hoping for at least 3 movies with Tom Holland and then a team up, and then transition to Miles getting 3 Movies.&&If that Venom movie is successful, Sony will definitely try to pump more comic book movies, which may be bad news for MCU Spidey.

I still don't understand what is Sony's plan. If making movies with Spidey villains means that they most likely won't appear in the MCU, then how in the hell will Marvel make Spidey movies for them ? No villains, no movies. Sony gets all the box office money, so why not led Marvel full control over the characters, if they're gonna receive the money anyway?&&[deleted]&&Iron Man 3 felt off due to lack of AC/DC in the film.

EDIT: Guys...it has to spoil something from Infinity War.&&So it’s likely “The New Avengers” or something along those lines, maybe?&&Avengers “Just Kidding, this is Infinity War Part 2 After All”&&Yeah but its a part 2 to infinity wars, just with a different subname, they filmed them simultaneously.&&[deleted]&&Infinity War: Spider-Man's funeral&&https://www.google.com.sg/amp/comicbook.com/marvel/amp/2017/10/12/avengers-4-title-no-spoiler/

It's been confirmed otherwise by the legend himself.&&I remember thinking, “Oh great, ANOTHER Spider-Man reboot.” 

Homecoming has been my favorite since the first Spider-Man with Toby Maguire in 2001. It was smart for the to pretend that the last two Sony movies didn’t exist, but also not try to do an origin story.
&&“Comic book fans either knew of the comic or they didn’t know they existed”... that literally applies to... everything. Like you either know something exists or you don’t know it exists lol&&Honestly, the whole thing is like a live action Futurama episode, except for the Family Guy level comedy. &&I enjoyed the second one a lot but as someone who ranks the first as one of his all time favorite films, I can agree with this. The second one's plot was mostly strong and the ending really shocked me with how much I was torn up about it. But when it came to the comedy I felt like the first one was a lot more naturally clever. Maybe it's the novelty wearing off, but I still watch the original at least a few times per year and I still love it.&&See I never understood the comedic relief gripes about guardians2 when people loved ragnarok so much more. I felt at least gotg2 let the serious moments keep their impact. Whereas ragnarok couldn't help cracking jokes even at what should be enormously emotional moments.&&I don’t disagree with you. Honestly, I think the humor is appropriately suited to a cast consisting of a manchild and a bunch of aliens with bad tempers and no social skills.

I like Guardians 2 on a whole. It just has some issues, like humor that’s not always the best, and dialogue that is *very* exposition-y. It’s still gorgeously made, and has a bunch of cool sci-fi stuff (like the mining craft with the mobile lasers, or Rocket’s spray-on ship repair).

I like superhero movies. And space opera. Guardians of the Galaxy is a lot of fun. They’re not above criticism, but there’s nothing wrong with enjoying them. &&Just too forced imo. It's like they heard that everyone thought Drax's laugh and Rocket's outbursts were funny so they had twice as many of them. Just didn't feel as genuine and too many jokes for me to feel emotionally invested.&&I liked the first one because it was perfect light comedy and action with a decent story. The second I liked but not as much because they did that thing where they tried to make every sentence a punchline. I'm not of fan of that tactic. &&Ultrons arc was just a shadow of the influence he needed to have for the movie to live up to its potential. James Spader was in my opinion the perfect voice for Ultron. I just didn't like how they made his end all plan to make a meteor out of a city and end humanity. In the comics he conquered tons of nations and essentially sent avengers/humans into hiding. The avengers animated film that's called ""the next avengers"" or something did a good job of capturing what Ultron really was meant to be &&God dammit. 

God *dammit*. I fucking remember watching that trailer in my dorm room, thinking ""holy fuck this villain is...he's fuckin awesome! He's going to really be something menacing and terrifying to watch, he's going to be a massive threat to the avengers!"" 

And then I saw the movie and I was like ""Oh. Well, maybe the next one will be better."" 

Fuck, I want the movie that *that* trailer was showing. Not what was given to us. 

*sigh*&&Building on that, my favourite scene of Ultron was him saying the line to Black Widow that goes like ""I wanted to show you this. I... have nobody else"". It does convey that it's lonely on the top feeling that was a great part of Ultron's characteristic.&&I love that they got away with the Pinocchio music in that trailer.

Edit: Sorry for being unclear. I didn't refer to any legal issues with using the music, rather the awesomeness of Marvel using a song from a Disney Classic in the trailer to a ""dark"" (which it turned out not to be) superhero movie. The best part is that it fits perfectly, it's just great!&&I guess we can't really know what happened but we know Avengers 2 was where Whedon became frustrated and disillusioned with the Marvel execs, my guess is a big part of that was them wanting a more fun/family friendly villain.

I feel like you don't cast James Spader if you're going for fun/family friendly.&&The fact that Captain America was able to trade fists with him is a huge issue. Cap is strong but not that strong. If Ultron can be hit back by Cap, Thor or Hulk should be able to destroy him no problem.&&They're starting to do it with Star Wars, too.  The Last Jedi felt more like a Marvel movie than a Star Wars one.&&This is why I'm pretty sure they'll fuck up X-men.

It's hard to capture the spirit of a group of people who live on the constant edge of genocide, if you're going to be joking around like in a Marvel movie. The trial balloons of 'We'll just add them into the universe and pretend they were always there!' are not exactly reassuring.

I'm starting to wonder if Disney is capable of doing a serious movie.&&same. shame, too. so good in the original guardians imo&&Agreed. Homecoming was certainly my favourite MCU film in 2017 because of this. &&Yup. Dave's at a point in his career where he doesn't need WWE, or any other major promotion, like NJPW or ROH, at all. That can be said only about a handful of guys right now. (Cena and Lesnar come to mind)

He'll show up for a few months, make a bunch of money, then hopefully leave on a better note than he did last time - since he deserves that. I think it'll end up being similar to Goldberg's run in 2016-2017, except with more/longer matches, and probably a feud with Haitch.&&Click like and subscribe below. Holds *thumbs up*&&or maybe there are others like me who found it funny and upvoted it, whether or not we like marvel movies. Most people don't get that offended and can laugh at themselves or their interests.&&It's sad when Agents Of SHIELD delivers more consistently than the violent, vulgar, promising, unlimited potential Netflix shows. Even sadder when you realize they are all made by the same studio.&&No, I understood it just fine. What is it with franchise movie fans playing the ""You don't understand it"" card for every grievance raised against their films? It's a Marvel film. Not high art. It's straightforward. 

I got Drax's character. What I meant was that It *also* serves as a way to elicit laughter from the crowd. It's not *only* to ""let them know"", which is what I wrote and implied in my purposely insufferable, circejerky, over the top initial  comment.  IMO laughter being the punchline is lazy comedy in my opinion, especially when overused. 

Drax laughing was mildly funny when it was out of place and showed a lack of awareness on his behalf e.g. ""You must be so embarrassed!"" But It was a ""joke"" that was done to death. After landing on Berhert it cuts to Drax on the floor laughing, ""Hahaha that was awesome. Yes!"". That's not funny to me and it's a lazy joke. *Oh, this guy should be in a lot of pain right now but he's laughing it off haha hilarious*. Or how about when they first arrive on Egos planet and he pops the bubble and then laughs. Again, I get his childlike wonder in that moment and how it's funny seeing the ""tough guy"" from the first film being more open with his emotions, while also being unaware of normal behaviour. I just don't find it funny and I think it's lazy. The Taserface joke is my main gripe. I'm pretty sure I get it. I just don't like it.

Furious 7 had a dead castmember for extra publicity, harry potter movies were every year rather than every 3 years.

Gaurdians 7 would be more like Saw 7 or Police academy 7.

Pearce even said ‘I’M the real Mandarin!’ or words to that effect. 

I wonder how many of the people who think the Mandarin was wasted in IM3 have read Iron Man comics. One of the things that made Iron Man a b-list hero before the films was his shitty stable of villains. The classic comics Mandarin is just a weird, slightly racist, uninspired character who is (arguably) the best of a very bad bunch of villains. Not having him faithfully portrayed in the films is no big loss &&Can't wait to watch the black and white version of Tony. &&Thor vs Voldemort, cool.&&Shame we already got that ""What are you the god of again?"" - ""Thunder"" exchange with Hela already.

The humanizing characterization in the game was actually pretty surprising and endearing.

Someone might argue that the game has more time than the movie to establish characterization, but I don't think that's necessary. The first Guardians movie gives Rocket a ton of depth in just a few minutes when he gets drunk and reveals he's self-conscious about people thinking he's ""a monster.""

The second movie slows down its deep character building, and even worse, it's constantly interrupting it with jokes, so you don't know how to feel in the moment. &&Yeah agree about Thor as well. Both films started out with way too many jokes and didn't set the movie up very well imo. Also hated the ""funny"" scenes with Odin. He was always serious and then just turns into a clown. Seems like the success of GotG has made then put extra effort into getting more jokes into all the films but having gone back and rewatched the films at the start of the Marvel rise it's sad how far we've strayed. Now these films are just comedies with super hero's instead of action films with jokes thrown in.&&I for one am excited to see Thanos drop a quip every 5 min.&&I don’t think think you have to worry. The quips in AoU were in result of Whedon. Infinity war is directed by the Russo’s who have, in my opinion, kept the most consistent tone in their last two films. Not to mention have made some of the best superhero films
Of all time. &&I'm aware. It's not a legal right I was referring to.&&Yeah, the final takedown amounted to nothing more than a team Care-Bear Stare, when in reality Ultron himself should have been the main threat, rather than the main threat being Ultron plus like 2,000 more robots slightly less stronger than Ultron.&&Which is a shame. What's so wrong about a more serious film nowadays? I still think The Dark Knight is my favorite comic book movie of all time but since it's Batman I guess it has to be more serious since he's a darker character. I just am getting annoyed at almost all Marvel movies following the exact same tone formula. &&""no no no you see you didn't GET the villain in this Marvel Masterpiece. This time, the villain who gets killed 2 hours after being introduced had a Machevellian motive which also mirrored Hamlet""

nah pretty sure invincible good guys just had a huge fist fight w/ disposable enemies with 0 tension in the climax because you know each main character is signed on to 3 more movies each through 2040.

and let me throw out the disclaimer that i have my guilty pleasure franchises (Fast and Furious babyyyyy).  But I recognized how flawed, goofy, and poorly executed they can be story telling wise, but i still enjoy watching them.  Lots of Marvel fans don't want to accept the fact that the entire universe is full of annoying tropes and entirely unoriginal. Which is fine and doesn't make them any less entertaining to their targeted crowd, but that crowd is kidding themselves if they think that *Avengers 3: fight for the end of the world* is going to be breakthrough cinema storytelling wise lmao&&What an absolute honor &&Dude named his son after that crab.

I think it was self aware and poked fun at its genre, kind of like ""Cabin in the Woods"" by Joss Whedon.  &&A lot of reviewers haven't seen the Captain America movies I guess.&&Ragnarok is not dark at all. The entire city gets destroyed and Thor and Loki just crack a couple of jokes. It's a fun movie and I enjoyed it. There is hardly a down moment.&&I felt they overdid it a bit with the jokes too. It took me out of the movie at times. Even though tons of shit went down, the emotional impact was often lost to humour. Idk, maybe I'll feel differently on the rewatch.&&> The humor was spot on at times, but I felt they overdid it a bit.

**aka Marvel.**&&There was a lot of room for more serious moments that just wasn't utilized. If the next Thor movie is even just half as funny as Ragnorok, but with a more serious undertone it would be perfect.&&Thor loses a whole lot in that movie. The aftermath is really dark for him&&[removed]&&Seriously how man franchises have 7 movies? Star Wars and fast and furious off the top of my head and im pretty sure they are doing more than ok.&&I really don't think Saw or Police Academy would be very good comparisons either. The first couple Saw films had a combined worldwide gross of about 250 million, and the first couple Police Academy films had a combined worldwide gross of about 215 million.

The first two Guardians movies had a combined worldwide gross of 1.6 billion. You can't compare a series as huge as Guardians to Saw or Police Academy.

I'd also like to point out that Saw movies were also released every year, so if you're going to say we can't compare Guardians to Harry Potter for that, we can't compare it to Saw either. Furthermore, Saw 7 still grossed even higher than the first Saw movie, so your point still doesn't even really stand.&&stupid tests&&There's a short movie (8min or so) that reveals the 10 rings and the actual real Mandarin exists in the MCU. You can probably find it by searching for ""short marvel Mandarin"" or something (I'm on mobile, can't do that right now). Pretty sure that's canon.&&I don't think the problem that people have with the way Mandarin was portrayed rises from the differences to the source material. People disliked that Mandarin was built up as a menacing and genuinely threatening villain only to be revealed to be a non-serious decoy, as the real villain was a cookie cutter baddie with no personality to speak of. The film was seemingly distancing Mandarin from the comics and doing its own thing, and doing it very well. They were essentially dangling a delicious treat in front of people and then throwing it away, and then giving them a bag of odorless, tasteless mediocrity.&&The problem I had with Iron Man 3 was that the movie did not live up to the trailer. I was really excited to see a more serious movie with an interesting new villain played by Sir Ben fuckin’ Kingsley. 

But instead we got an OK 80’s-style action movie with a cookie-cutter villain and some iron man suits on the side.
&&Holy carp, don't blink! ..That's when they get you.&&I am fairly confident that someone will at least sarcastically call Quill 'space-man' at some point in the next Avengers film.&&[deleted]&&And the animatrix&&I think it's probable that the fight with Thanos won't be wrapped up in the first one. But assuming it is, Secret Invasion seems most likely.

Consider that Captain Marvel, released between the 2 movies, will feature the Skrulls.&&You're right on the comparison between the earlier and late movies.. I think they definitely hit a sweet spot with Guardians/Civil War.

Instead of understanding the formula for why they worked, they've identified the ""good bits"" and are beginning to shoehorn them in everywhere. Starting with the trailers.

All the male leads are the same character, etc. etc. Comedies with superheroes verus Superhero movies with humour is a good way of putting it.

Edit: Best brace ourselves for the downvotes.&&Honestly the success of Gaurdians of the Galaxy has thrown a wrench into a lot of Disney's newer movies. Thor suffered immensely from forced, misplaced humor as did The Last Jedi. While watching both of those movies I couldn't help but feel like the shadow of Gaurdians over it. To me, Gaurdians was initially such a hit because it was fresh and different, and now they're using that model to death.

Maybe it's just me, and I'm getting older and fatigued, but these movies just don't have the heart anymore. All I can see is Disney milking the cash cow as furiously and relentlessly as they can.&&I hope they put a smile on my face.&&Their relationship isn’t negative afaik. &&even in the dark events they were pulling jokes, which some say that's Marvel movies all around but Thor was really noticeable and a couple of times I felt like they went too far with the jokes, apart from GotG2 I think it's the only Marvel movie where I left thinking that in some parts they should've toned down the humor&&One of my favourite trivia about Mars Attack is that the producers didn't want Tim Burton to kill off a high profile actor like Jack Nicholson. Tim Burton wrote a 2nd part for him and killed him twice. 


Also I watched mars attack first as like an 8 year old in a family friends apartment in a city i never been before when we were visiting China and it was late at night and I watched it right before sleeping. Seeing those disintegration and the disguised Martian seducing his way into the white house before killing that guy was terrifying. Took forever before I could fall asleep. Love the movie now. Yodeling music saves the day and Jack Black being disintegrated.  Pierce Bronson as a head  &&Exactly, and it deserves to be self aware. Just like Deadpool poking fun at previous failed adaptations, Ragnarok was sort of poking fun at the seriousness of the first two movies.

In many interviews, Hemsworth makes it pretty clear he didn't like where the movies took his character and had been looking for an opportunity to change that. Obviously he did and it worked out great. &&spot on, thor hitting himself with the ball in hulks room instantly made me think of chris trying to jump the ravine on his bike in CintW lol&&Right? I thought Winter Soldier was the darkest movie in the MCU by far. Civil War is a close second. But Ragnorak? Not even close. &&This was a bit much though. I've seen them do bad jokes before, but in moderation. This one however was just one joke after the other.

The only really funny part imo was Krog and the interaction between Loki and the Hulk. &&* Friday the 13th

I absolutely LOVE that scene too. A chill midnight trip to the underworks - set a really strong tone and removed any potential cheese from the dialogue/analogy he made.

[Here's the clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny_mr3QX9Q8). Sorta hard to find.&&>they are relationship&&That was my biggest problem with the film.  It felt like they couldn't go more than 5 minutes without feeling the need to insert a joke somewhere.   As such nothing really had any emotional weight to it and frankly there was a lot of very impactful things that happened.  There were plenty of scenes that should have been allowed to have some gravity to them like [Odin passing, realizing that most Asguardians including the warrior's three were killed, and seeing Asguard itself destroyed](#spoiler) but none of those were allowed to be a somber moment before a joke was thrown in and killed any impact it could have had emotionally.  &&[I think it mostly had to do with the kill count in Ragnarok (a big chunk of asgard died in that movie) but i cant really relate to the characters that died, and that scene also started off with a gag, sort of ruined the effect of the genocide.] (#spoiler) &&How do you not see it? Ragnarok is really dark if you just analyze the film (spoilers, obviously):

- Mjolnir destroyed
- Odin dead
- Asgard destroyed
- Thor loses eye
- Banner possibly lost inside the Hulk forever (he's not, probably, but Ragnarok on its own dangles that)
- All of Thor's Merry Men are dead
- Countless Asgardians dead

This was The Empire Strikes Back of MCU films. They just buried it under so much humor that you didn't notice.

Because how many people died in Winter Soldier? A handful? Ragnarok had a few literal tons of people. 

So darkest movie? Probably. It's late right now, but I am hard-pressed to think of any films with this much death.&&Add James Bond to the list&&You missed a big one: Harry Potter.&&Only 6 paranormal activity movies so far. &&There's like 22 Land Before Time movies.&&This guy knows his stuff 👍🏻&&The Land Before Time&&Dracula

I have a huge feeling that they'll reboot the franchise after Bumblebee and T6. Imo, they should reboot it, get new writers, a decent director, and release the prequel as the first of a new trilogy. Then set the second and third one in Earth.&&Literally just because you say so? I mean there is zero evidence of any franchise doing bad because it's into high numbers, but your gonna stick with that just cause.&&Harry Potter is kinda different though, seeing as it's based on a book series.

Nice Cage acting as himself playing John Travolta playing Nic Cage is pure genius.

Being famous doesn’t pay the bills. &&Put the bunny in the box&&The film ""Joe"" is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. The man can act. The problem is he does act. In every movie known to man, no matter how terrible.&&He's a fantastic actor with a load of crap roles under his belt.&&How nobody has mentioned Lord of War is beyond me. &&I think that whole thing is just a meme.

A lot of his movies didn't stand up well over time, but were popular when released. He's not a bad actor, he's just in a lot of movies that people think of as bad. But the thing is, we have all seen them so he must be pretty good, really. 

And honestly, I love him at his cheesiest too. Con Air is top 5 for the greatest action movie ever, if you ask me. Just look at the cast list: Nick Cage, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, John Cusck, etc.&&""Mr. Cage, I want you to sing *The Hokey-Pokey* while smashing this with a sledgehammer.""

Thank you for the warning. I hate that shit. &&>story spoiler at the end of the trailer.

It's mentioned at the beginning of the trailer and the film.&&yeah just stop watching at 1:50&&the grandparents show up, played by even more famous stars from the 80s, like stallone, or something, and try to kill cage and the wife, so the entire family comes together to kill the old folks...&&My brain kept trying to make me read ""smileys"" because I haven't heard or read the word simile in years.

Before Con Air, Cage was weirder than Crispin Glover.&&""*Kevin! You ate the face off the neighbor's cat!!!""*&&Also saw it there. I’d say it’s good, nothing too amazing though&&How do AMA's work, do I have to submit my questions to a moderator or do I just get on there and post my question?&&Oh shit, Happy is by the guy that did Crank? Now I actually need to watch it.&&Omg I caught the first 2 episodes on youtube of happy! Could easily be one of my top 5 favorite shows if it stays consistent.&&Yes!

&&Wow... Just wow... I can't believe I've never seen that and just... No words... &&Crazy Cage never left...&&Go Rocks!&&NOOOOOOOT THE BEEEEEEEEES! &&Same. He's so fun to watch in movies. Even if the movie is bad, you will remember it because it was still fun to watch because of Cage.&&And fucking upvoted to a ludicrous degree. For a user base that seems to hate advertising, they sure will promote anything as long as its in r/movies.&&

“Twisted remake of Home Alone on bath salts”

Is implying that the movie is like a crazy, warped version of Home Alone. 
&&Yeah what does that even mean?&&I feel like they might be referencing gone in 60 seconds.&&Gone in 60 Speed Crazy Seconds. &&Gone in 60 seconds &&I thought it was saying that the makers of Home Alone took bath salts and made a movie. &&So.. who's making the GoFundMe ""for a film from the makers of *Home Alone* on *Bath Salts*""&&Honestly makes me want to see it&&It's like the initial promotion of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - Like Seinfeld on Crack &&Even if you don’t try at all!&&> try hard enough.

Nick Cage certainly will.&&Good luck with Leaving Las Vegas&&I recently watched one of his movies, can’t even remember the name but it was basically an Escalade commercial. Definitely not supposed to be a comedy, still had great laughs from Cage. &&https://giphy.com/gifs/HPvfnOuz1tOgg/html5&&That was the scene from the trailer where I noticed how terrible the camerawork is, and then that's all I could pay attention to for the rest of the video.

If the whole thing is like this, it ~~might actually~~ will ruin the movie for me.

*Turns out today is Nick Cages Birthday!
&&You would think, but he's only 12 years older than her so not quite. It's not like Tom Cruse and Sarah Wright (in American Made) where she is a full 21 years younger. &&I think maybe she is the mom.&&Cage: I'm a killer.

&&*Indiewire review:*

""**Mom and Dad**"" has the same depraved verve, sick humor and berserk pulse of the ""Crank"" series, and what's more, marries all that to an operatic Nicolas Cage performance in full on nutzoid mode.""

So **Crank**, starring Nicolas Cage. Dreams really do come true.&&Crank + Nicholas Cage was all you had to say. Sold. &&Oh really? Was gonna ignore this one but now i got to see it.&&Same here. 

The only way the Crank films could have been more outrageous is if they stared Nicolas Cage instead of Jason Statham.

This is now a must see film for me.&&One of the two anyway. It’s missing Mark Neveldine.&&Crank has all my favorite ridiculous action movie type moments back-to-back!

I too am sold.&&I've been keeping up with [Happy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7OYkSgmM-w) that's also by him, been enjoying the season so far. &&Every new detail I learn of this upcoming film increases hype level by 10.&&Both since the grandparents are coming to dinner&&If only all the roles were played by Cage.....&&That's what I was thinking. This sounds like a feature length version of the church scene.&&> Crank and Gamer

I fucking loved those, these and Shoot 'Em Up, there really needs to be more ridicoulous over the top action movie.


&&If you enjoy this style of movie, check out 'Shoot 'em Up' with Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti.&&Yeah, I feel like Selma Blair co starring is going to put this movie over the top in ridiculousness. I never knew I wanted to see this pair so much. &&It's the perfect combination. Nicolas Cage meets Crank.&&[deleted]&&Ignore the heathens, my friend... They do not know what makes them stumble&&Turn career around&&It’s not ‘Lords of War’, it’s just ‘Lord of War’&&The crowd made it awesome too!&&You're right. It'll go up to 99%&&One of the best Coen Brothers films&&$4.99 on iTunes now. I just bought it. &&I'd like to take his face...off.&&What I like about that movie is that when they switch faces, John Travolta decides he's going to act like Nick Cage, but Nick Cage still just acts like himself.&&I'm Castor Troy&&Love that movie. &&Face/Off, face off! it works on two levels!&&I could eat a peach for HOURS&&TEA LEONI IN THE SHOWER. Everything else about the movie is of no consequence. &&It's a perfect mess of a movie and he is great in it &&I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!&&I think it’s the greatest worst performance in cinema history. Most of the worst performances in film are by because the people are just untalented/untrained actors. Cage uses technique and talent until it overflows into madness in Vampires Kiss. Fuck, I love that movie. &&That is so perfect thanks for sharing :)&&That scene [with the lizards while he was high](#spoiler) in Bad Lieutenant was like holy crap, wtf?&&He was born to play this role.&&Fun fact: that footage of him smashing things while singing the hokey pokey was a home video he gave to the director as a birthday present three years ago, the director subsequently came up with the plot to the movie and started filming immediately.&&I would not be surprised at all if that entire scene wasn’t even called for. 

The crew got there and Cage was preparing for the role. Then they fired up the camera and mics and filmed Cage doing that and put it in the movie.&&I saw star wars 8 in the cinema. And every trailer before sw8 was like a small recup of the whole movies. There were the story twists in the trailer and for example how a whole kidnapping situation goes out which was the main plot of a movie. Trailers become more and more ridiciolous and spoilerish. This is bullshit. &&But clearly it’s something you can gloss over and be surprised by at the end.

Im sure she done quite a bit more.&&Same here, ever since ""The Sweetest Thing"".&&He's been in the house the whole time. &&Thats because its mostly bots.&&r/evenwithcontext&&As crazy as accelerating from zero to sixty over an unspecified distance and time.&&I think that's just the movie title in China. && No one knows what it means, but its provocative.  Gets the people GOIN'!&&It's like a home alone remake on bath salts &&Well saying ""zero to 60"" is doing a terrible job of that lol&&I am a famous director, producer, and script writer currently collecting donations to create this film. no bamboozles&&Totally. Reminds me of the tag line to ""The Kingdom"" (the Danish TV series), ""Like ER on acid.""

Plus I'm just stoked that bath salts might become relevant again. I wrote a paper on them in school, and could always use more cites.&&It's my theory that Nicholas cage is trying to be in every movie. Not every genre, every movie. Every franchise, every type. And it will only stop if he gets a part in Star Wars.&&Not the bees!&&The bees!! Not the bees!!&&I remember seeing The Wicker Man scene where he ran up dressed as a bear and punched someone. At that moment I felt I needed to watch the whole movie from the start.

It was worth it to see that scene again.&&A movie pun in a discussion about N.C. about one of his movies? 

We need at least 3 more!

**NEXT!**&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIdXPIN3j38&&Yeah that would really bother me as well.&&it's like they're using the motion tracker tool on after effects&&I think we found Nic Cage's secret reddit account everybody!&&Writing Credits: Nick Rage&&IN A CAVE!&&But ... but ... what’s about Jeff Goldblum? I’m sure Hollywood scripts that get approved only contain 2 types of roles:

- Fits to N. Cage

- Fits to J. Goldblum 

Only exception(s) are the role of a bad-ass billionaire, womanzier, technic freak with a dead father whose got captured in a warzone and escaped by building an armored body suit. IMHO no one could have done that role better. Its like J. Depp playing (Captain) Jack Sparrow. Those are the only acceptable excuses.


—————-

**TL;DR**

Your movie script doesn’t fit to N. Cage or J. Goldblum?

#NEXT!&&Nic Cage has not aged well while Selma Blair has aged exceedingly well.&&That's one of my favorite episodes of Community.&&Huuaawwwww!&&Here you go https://i.imgur.com/uCqk8bs.gifv&&Bees?&&If anyone hasn't seen it, the original Wicker Man is one of the best psychological thrillers ever.

~*Screen Crush*&&Its...going to be...just beautiful.  I can't wait.&&Crank was written for Cage but they weren’t able to afford him at the time &&Isn't that Ghost rider though?&&Yep, knew nothing about it before but if it's anything like Crank and with Nic Cage then I just can't defend not checking it out.&&I'm putting money in the grandparents being the same kind of crazy as the mom and dad and trying to kill them&&So underappreciated. This is one of the most ridiculously fun movies I've ever seen. &&One of my all-time favorite fun movies. The baby-in-the-road scene is classic. Kingsman the first is right up there on that level, as well.&&I fucking love this ridiculous movie. Any time I've found it come on TV I dropped everything to watch it. This is going to be great!&&This movie beautiful. The gun fight while having sex and making quippy one liners is cinematic gold &&He hates ponytails&&or flesh eating mothers from the 80s&&I'm definitely not the only one that saw it as a Bugs Bunny Elmer Fudd action movie, right? 
&&Her role is amazing, if not scene stealing. Her character is a mother struggling with irrelevance as her kids grow up, and she mentioned after the movie that she drew a lot of inspiration from her own experience of fading from mega stardom after she decided to spend more time at home raising her own children.&&Isn't that just Drive Angry?&&Pretty sure Nic Cage met crank a long time ago&&Yes, but they are not highly regarded by the critics with a 60% on RT.&&They don't do well critically though.&&Some people love them, some people don't. If he critics are anything to go by, this is less divisive.

Before you think it's just elitist critics, crank 2 is officially rated as rotten by audiences, with a 49%&&The first one was awesome. The second good but not as great as the first. Mind you most Jason Stathom movies are pretty good. &&They clearly don't know about the one true god.&&Thank you, but I prefer it my way.&&The 2nd one will be ""Lords of War"" &&It was a fun night!

I had avoided The Last Jedi trailers until the day I was seeing it, but had to leave the theatre temporarily to avoid spoilers for the movie I was currently seeing. So dumb. &&I've recently made it a point to avoid them entirely when I didn't want to anything at all about Dunkirk before seeing it. It's been great, I just change the channel or leave the room when they come on TV, and I only look at movie posters before seeing a new movie.

It's like he takes every movie offered to him no matter how bad it is.&&It will only stop when someone lets Cage play Superman. 

Man didn’t name his son Kal-El on a whim.  && I remember reading a while ago that Nicholas loves roles where his character is either completely insane or has the ability to go insane under certain circumstances.  If you watch most of his films, you’ll see this.  It’s a role he regularly enjoys taking, and I think it fits his personality perfectly.&&I think Samuel L Jackson is the same way. Between the two of them, they're in every damn movie that comes out.&&I think he could make a good long lost brother for Han Solo - Hans Solo.&&He ...

""Nicolas Cage was once considered one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40 million in 2009 according to Forbes...

...Now worth around $25 million (as of May 2017), Cage is reportedly ""taking [film] roles left and right"" in order to pay off his remaining debts.""

That sucks, but hey he's at least still finding work.
&&Financial troubles. Owed the IRS a lot in back taxes and he had spent almost his entire fortune.  If you want any leniency from them you have to show your working continuously, no more sitting around waiting for a fat paying A list movie.  &&Not the Bs! Not the Bs!

Superman Lives. 

Seriously. http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/83912124-132.html 55 second mark shows Cage in a test suit. &&I'd be okay with him playing an older Earth-2 Superman or even Jor-El&&You mean, when someone lets him play Luke Cage, who he literally named himself after. &&Dude is great.

I loved him as the doped up cop in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans and he was really good in Kick-Ass as well.&&No no it's like in The Lost Boys where the old guy end up being a vampire and the grandpa ends up being a sort of drunk vampire killer.&&When I first sweet the trailer I thought the implication was be that the grandparents would try to save the kids, but then the twist occurred to me.

I think I need new friends :/&&Poor kid, that's some shit that would have terrified me when I was young too. I was too scared to ever say 'idk what you're talking about' so I'd just say things that sounded vaguely correct but were hilariously wrong. &&I thought it was that his accountant had been embezzling a bunch of money from him.&&We win either way. I love Cage.&&Ooor maybe he just really enjoys acting in front of camera; and doesn't really care *what* he's playing, how much it will pay him or what people ultimately think of him for doing what he wants. Good on ya, Cage, good on ya! &&I totally respect that he keeps working, though. Like he takes any job. I know a lot of the movies he makes now are awful, but I can't knock his hustle trying to pay off his debt. &&[deleted]&&This makes me want to write a movie script and send it to Nick Cage and let him push to get it made so I don’t have to. &&I would assume he gets nice royalties on his previous work &&**Beads?!**&&Oh I know. I think he auditioned for the role in Superman Returns with Bryan Singer too. He’s made no secret of the fact that Superman is his dream role lol

I think he only took the role of Ghost Rider to try and prove that he could lead a superhero blockbuster. Too bad that turned out how it did. &&Also the source of a superb Kevin Smith story&&I’d like to meet the guy with the balls to green light a movie featuring Nic Cage in blackface. &&Vampire's Kiss and Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call are great depictions of mad people. And Leaving Las Vegas is a different kind of madness.&&Killing me won't bring back your goddamned honey!&&Lmao and the whole ""F.B.I"", then some guy letting him take his ferrari like that means anything.&&He wasn't blacklisted, OP was referring to the period of time in the 1950s when people in Hollywood were denied employment because they were accused of having communist sympathies. Screenwriters would publish under pseudonyms to get around it.&&Brenaissance*&&The one true god and his only son. &&It isn't working out very well because Liam Neeson is basically a poor man's Liam Neeson. I used to assume Neeson was some sort of acclaimed actor like Daniel Day Lewis or Viggo Mortensen, and maybe he was like 20 years ago. But really his movies are just giant schlock-fests not unlike your typical Nicholas Cage feature.&&I could go for that.&&It's Netflix overload anymore. U have to put the screen in front of their face &&I know he was so cute. I'm sure most of us have done it as some point. Adults do it all the time as well. There are times that I'm familiar with a certain topic or question but not completely sure so I vaguely answer or just make an educated guess to what the answer might be. We don't like admitting we don't know in front of others. When kids do it, it's innocent and funny. &&He also takes gambling advice from his pet octopus&&Little of column A, little of column B maybe? &&It wasn't just embezzling. The Cagester went a bit nuts with his spending, and kept forgetting to pay his taxes. $150,000,000 was his estimated net worth in 2008, he's down to a ^^^^still ^^^^pretty ^^^^fuckin ^^^^huge $25,000,000 after selling most of his cars and houses. I think he had to sell one of his Superman #1's as well, which probably made him sad. &&he also bought a whole bunch of dumb shit like haunted houses and stuff&&He also has a large collection of dinosaur bones. Moreso, he apparently outbid Leonardo Dicaprio for a dinosaur skull at a little over a quarter million which later turned out to be a stolen fossil from Mongolia. With spending habits like that, I don't think you can entirely blame an accountant for money troubles even with embezzling. &&I totally agree. &&we love an actor!&&he had a lot of financial problems. pretty sure it was tax issues with the IRS and they basically wiped out a good chunk of his savings and/or assets and is still in debt. 

Also his accountant sent him into financial ruin and was embezzling money from Cage. Pretty sure thats how he ended up owing the taxes, and IRS wants their money no matter what. he sued his accountant but doubt he got his money back. as my Dad says, can't get blood from a stone!

the financial problems are probably part of it... but I'm sure he enjoys acting as well (like you said), because other than maybe Samuel Jackson, he has to be one of the hardest working people in Hollywood. have to love what you're doing if you put that much into it. 

I hope he pays off all his debt and can actually enjoy his money, he works damm hard for it. &&And it’s all just added to the strange cult mythos surrounding him. There was even a whole Abed plot in an episode of Community about him. &&Honestly this making a seems like the most normal movie star

Instead of doing crazyshit or trying to get sponsors he just takes what work he can get&&I hope he can pay off his debts and start actually picking movies instead of just taking anything he can get. &&Christopher Walken takes any role offered to him. That's why he also has been in a bunch of random low quality movies, as well as major ones. He said he just never wanted to turn down a role that someone wanted him for. &&Same.  A lot of actors would just be too stuck up and wallow in their bankruptcy, but he’s doing what he’s got to do.&&And I mean he still makes some good movies too.
 
They can't ALL be garbage. &&That doesn't translate to what he has in the bank at all.

I mean Jesse Eisenberg is playing Luthor Jr., so It could be interesting.&&Fuck that, I liked his Ghost Rider.&&Ya but Ghost Rider 2 was awesome. &&He's definitely gonna have a come back one day, someone will cast him in a well fitting weirdo type role in a big profile film.

Edit: Let go of the hate, you'll feel better. It doesn't matter.&&Yeah, it's nice to feel like he's not pretentious or thinks he's above stuff, in a weird way. You don't see stories about him doing fucked up ""I'm so REAL"" method acting bullshit or anything, he's just trying to do a job and get paid.&&I’m sure at least a handful of the films he works on are ones that he’s personally interested in. Despite all the goofy c-grade films he appears in, almost every year he’s also been in something good.&&so my film idea, *Walken to Your Mom's House*, can be a thing?&&While I certainly could never fault someone for turning down a movie for any reason, I think this is the ideal.  Personally, I think it's very respectful to the creators to accept if you are able (if you have the time, energy, stability, etc.) to do the movie.  At the end of the day, I have infinitely more professional respect for someone who throws their heart into every role than someone who makes a judgment about a piece of work that, upon casting, is in its infancy.&&It's awesome when he does because he elevates everything he is in&&[deleted]&&But we need Connery to be his Obiwan equivalent.

For clarification, I’m not saying I’d like to see Cage as Superman. Not that he wouldn’t give it his all, he always seems to give 110% no matter the film, I just think it was disappointing how Ghost Rider turned out. &&He could wear a bald wig over his everyday wig&&I liked Spirit of Vengeance, and I liked the special effects from the first.

If you can't pay, yeah, they'll sell you up. If you're earning money and making payments that will eventually clear the debt without them having to take enforcement action then they'll let you pay it down - with interest of course. Painful, painful interest.&&Only thing is, I'm still bot sure if they ever clarified if Luthor Sr. was still alive or not in the DCEU. &&Finally some Cage love in this thread! The man works his tits off, he’s nothing if not committed, and he gets a lot of hate coz maybe he’s not naturally gifted at acting. But he goes for it.

"John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli in ‘Lord of the Rings,’ lost the top of his middle finger as a kid and had special prosthetic made. He played a prank on Peter Jackson where he cut off the tip of the prosthetic, covered it with blood, walked up to Peter and said, “Boss, I had an accident.”",32483,7px7hu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUMpQsjhEbo,717,1515770230.0,,"He was also allergic to the prosthetic for his face and it caused him to constantly break out with skin rashes after each day.  This caused him to be so self conscious about his appearance that he hardly ever went out with the crew or fellow actors after a shooting day.

On his final day of shooting he ripped the mask off and they burned it as a celebration for him.&&All that explaining and effort and They didn’t even show Peter’s reaction. Lame.

*Hands it to him.*&&I know John has had a long and storied career with many serious roles. But a lot of my favourite Rhys-Davies characters-- Gimli, Sallah and even Man Ray-- radiate laughter and enthusiasm.

I can just imagine Gimli fucking with Aragorn in the same manner &&Asps.

My other claim to fame is the late Sir Norman Wisdom, needless to say nerves were high the first time I met this comedy legend.&&The most unsettling thing about this is seeing gimli as a giant. He looks more like hagrid.&&He’s such an awesome person.

I got a job at a butcher shop and I thought an hilarious prank in my first week would be to stuff some stewmeat in the tip of a latex glove, put it on, and slice it off in front of my boss and freak out.

...

I never went through with it, because I figured I'd misjudge it and cut off more of my damn finger&&He'll always be Paladin from Wing Commander to me &&He'll always be Sallah from *Raiders of the Lost Ark*.

Gimli isn't a midget?

Fuck my whole world up fam...

Edit for context: I saw these movies back before I was interesting in movie production and never saw any behind the scenes stuff.&&And my fingertip!&&LMAO I love how putting a cheap ""no copyright infringement intended"" on your video somehow makes it legal for you to infringe the copyright.&&And that's why you always leave a note...&&I worked on a film with Davies. I rode to set in the shuttle with him a few times he was an extremely fun loving guy. Very funny boisterous all around nice guy.&&Broooo I saw his fingers and it look like a guy butt naked just squatting&&Don't you mean an ""axeident"".&&I had a similar thing happen to me by mistake. I have fucked up looking hands, like really fucked up. I was playing soccer and broke a fingernail in the middle, so my finger was covered in blood. Coach takes one look and starts freaking the fuck out until I manage to tell him the only thing wrong was the blood.&&The Professor always delivers&&>Boss, I had an accident   
With my axe!&&Good thing he only lost the top of his finger. It’d look weird if he lost the middle part. &&This man also shit himself during Indiana Jones and this movie.&&TIL that the dwarf in LOTR wasn't a real dwarf actor with some make up&&Wow&&Could you not use a synopsis of the video as your title...&&TIL that Maximulliom Arturo lived out his days in an alternate reality where he was believed to be a dwarf. &&With a missing middle finger, how does he communicate with other drivers on the freeway?&&Had no idea that was the same guy as from sliders and Indiana Jones. Dude doesn't age!!!? Or he looked like a 50 year old dude when he was 20?&&Well that was pretty disappointing. I wanted to see Peter’s reaction...&&*Axeident&&Wasn’t he the only member of the main cast not to get the Fellowship tattoo also?&&I just realized he played the professor in Sliders.&&Holy shit! Is he the professor from Sliders??&&[deleted]&&Aaaah... Lord of the Rings. Best thing ever created by Mankind. Every year i marathon watch them with my girlfriend. Our two cats are named Bilbo and Frodo too. :-)&&No shot of the reaction, Booooooooo. &&> covered it with blood

So I guess the prank was that it wasn't *his* accident...&&Every editings always skip the actual money shot.  That's why I like Jackie Chan movies.

Yeppp.

John&&Why does this video have everything - except Peter Jackson's reaction in the moment? It has before and after, so they made a video all about his reaction, and then edit it out. This makes no sense to me.&&All those cameras around and nobody caught it on film? And, if you did: Then why not just SHOW it?&&I cannot tell people enough when they tell me that they've watched Lord of the Rings even multiple times and have never ever watched the appendices to stop what they're doing and go do that. The appendices are arguably the best behind the scenes footage in existence.&&These behind the scene videos are so strange. It just feels wrong to see Gimli towering over everyone like that.&&Well Pete got us all back with those Hobbit movies, didn’t he.&&I have quoted him for years from one scene:
""They're digging in the wrong place""
and 
""Bad dates""&&Did anyone else read ""Boss, I had an accident"" in the Gimli voice in their head?&&Nobody tosses a dwarf!
Love John Rhys-Davies. His bits in the extended edition DVDs were a joy... 'Partridge?..bring the partridge'&&I literally came across this post as I'm watching FOTR right on a Gimli scene. Perfect timing.&&Covered with whose blood?&&It was weird seeing a full sized Gimli.&&Back in the day when extra feature disks were still new enough, and DVD releases were still kinda a special thing that it was actually a really cool thing to watch all the bonus content.&&This is the most interesting thing that came out of LOTR. &&John Rhys-Davies looks and sounds like he could be Sean Connery's little brother.&&""Boss, i had an axe-cident."" FTFY&&I did this at work once.

It was our leads last day before he took a job up in the office so a girl and I used makeup and superglue to make it look like a piece of bone was coming out of my leg.

He completely lost it and threw up when he saw it and the manager was out there laughing his ass off.  Our manager gave us permission to do it if we did it on our break.&&Well I guess we have our Logen Ninefingers for the First Law film.&&That videos dumb it didn't shoe the prank. Looks like it was recorded why not show it&&I am the monarch of the sea...
&&It is so insane how much bigger he is than everyone else, yet Jackson worked his magic to make him so short.&&hahah lol&&Well, that was unsatisfying.  Seems they had the actual footage, but we got a recount of it instead, plus the before and after.&&An axe-ident?&&Is it just me, or as he puts the makeup on, he gets smaller? &&Why not just leave Gimli without the tip of his middle finger?  A smashed or amputated finger is pretty much something I'd expect of a dwarf.&&I did the same thing to my sixth grade teacher, only.. I had lost the tip of my thumb to a paper cutter. Those things are like guillotines for fingers.&&When I was 8, my left index finger was caught in a gate and was smashed (it didn't fall off), instead it was just flattened. The docs tried to revive it for 2 months before they decided to amputate it.

When I was a little older in the 4th grade I had a substitute teacher. I put my finger in my ear, raised my hand and said ""umm I got my finger stuck in my ear""

She says ""oh dear, we're going to have to take you to the nurse"".

I said ""haha just kidding, I have half a finger!""

The next day the other teacher came back and I had to write a report on how I lost my finger.

Edit: and ya, that is the reason for my SN&&haaha priceless&&OK I should really watch the special features on the boxset I have.&&Man, the making-of documentaries they released with the extended editions have so many gems like this.&&hahah lmao&&NOBODY TOSSES A DWARF!!&&I hear he lost it in a freak camel riding incident near Alexandretta.&&His voice sounds like sean Connery &&Can do more better.

There was something about a woman having to leave a show because it was so bad of a reaction she couldn't keep doing it after 2 or 3 years.  Andromeda?  &&Actually they were given to him as a gift on his last day of shooting and he tossed them in the fire.&&why would they not find an alternative for him?&&no matter how many times i see him all I can see is him in sliders.&&lol this reminds me of some documentary I saw on the making of Nightmare on Elm Street... the guy who plays freddie said at the end of the day he would just violently rip the mask off and some of the crew would pick up the pieces like they were a collectors item lol (i guess they probably are/were).&&So you're saying he cast it into the fire?&&[deleted]&&You'd think they could have found an adhesive that was hypoallergenic, if they really put in the effort. Are any dermatologists or make-up professionals here that would care to comment?&&Take a look at Tim Curry’s make up in Legend. It took five and a half hours to apply the makeup needed for Darkness onto Curry and at the end of the day, he would spend an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. At one point, Curry got too impatient and claustrophobic and pulled the makeup off too quickly, tearing off his own skin in the process. 



This was also the reason he didn’t want to take the role as Pennywise the clown at first - he didn’t want to go through the make up stuff again. 



Also - I’ve read about an actor who had to have a scar made for his role. They used Rigid Collodion, but used every day for a long time, the scar becomes almost permanent. It burns the skin and it can easily turn into a real scar.&&For fuck's sake. I came in finally thinking ""oh, nice a happy story with him, usually people are just going on about how he hated everything because of the makeup""...&&Nick kroll has a similar story about working on the ""so easy a caveman can do it"" commercials. 

Hollywood is not the place for sensitive skin.&&What mask?&&They had it on camera too. They showed the beginning and the end of the prank, and then just showed impressions of the part that actually matters. I was so disappointed. &&I am so illogically mad right now. 

THEY HAD THE MOMENT BEFORE AND EVERYONE AFTER, WHY DIDN'T THEY SHOW JACKSON'S REACTION?!?!?!? &&It's because the crew misremembering his reaction was more interesting than his actual reaction. Showing the footage would have been underwhelming compared to how we imagined it went, based on the retelling.&&Buildup probably better than the reaction

During our off times when we weren’t needed on set we would film stupid little shorts with John’s assistant and another actor. 

He’s also one of the nicest people I’ve met. Made me feel right at home on set. &&I’ve met the man and he’s a beautiful human being. He wasn’t well when I met him and I thought he wouldn’t be alive much longer (thankfully I was wrong) but despite it he was very talkative and very...I can’t put it into words, I guess the only way I can describe it is that it felt like someone who knew they didn’t have long to live reflecting on their life and wanting to pass on as much as they could. He was giving amazing advice to people, life lessons as well as career advice. I live close to where he grew up and he talked about coming to visit occasionally as his parents are buried there. There were definite flashes of that fun side of him too but he was in a fair bit of pain. To see this man in discomfort talking so enthusiastically with people about themselves was really touching. Easily one of the best celebrity encounters I’ve ever had.&&Which one is in Indiana Jones? That one is good. 

Ok Sallah. I thought so. 

I also learned he's very old. No longer fat. And he's not so keen on Muslim immigration. &&“Hey Jackson, fuck you!” *Bites off a bit of his finger* “In fact I’ll just give you the finger and let you keep it!”&&At first I thought you were saying that he should assault Peter Jackson by biting his finger off. &&It would have been better if they actually showed what they were telling us, since they clearly had the footage and edited out that part.&&Yeah, it does look pretty weird seeing tall Gimli. But he's actually the tallest of all the actors in the Fellowship! Which was a good thing, because that meant he could share scenes with the Hobbits without any special effects (as Dwarves are taller than Hobbits).&&Rhys-Davies was proportionally taller than the Hobbit actors too, so it simplified the compositing&&He is freaking massive! It may be because I'm used to seeing him in his dwarf size but my brain just processes him as a giant.&&Rhys-Davies is one of those actors. one minute hes in Lord of the rings, Indiana jones.  Then, the next minute, Sliders, Shannara Chronicles, and every god awful Si-fi channel tv movie you can find.&&He also played Treebeard&&His role in sliders being much more important.&&In addition to Paladin from the 'Wing Commander' series, he also played the first live-action version of Wilson Fisk.

Edit: I can't believe I forgot, but he also voiced Thor in the 1990s 'Fantastic Four' cartoon, and my favorite character from 'Gargoyles', Macbeth.&&<sings> ""I am the monarch of the sea...""

I love Sallah. Between him, Marion, and Belloq the first Indy movie had such a stellar supporting cast.&&""Indy, why does the floor . . . move?""&&Thank you. I knew I knew the guy's face, and was about to look him up. No idea it was the same actor, this whole time. &&When I was kid and the LOTR movies were just coming out, we would always play LOTR on the playground.

He is very appreciative of his fans and even more appreciative who ""work"" at these comiccons (Offers free pictures for the volunteers and once he finishes his panel, will make sure all those working backstage has a picture with him if they want.). We're not paid. But for John, he genuinely has fun at comiccons and not there to just make money. &&For me, as soon as I heard him talk I was like 'oh shit, sliders!' ... but I saw more of that show as a kid than raiders.  :D&&Well these movies have some of the most extensive behind the scenes footage I've ever seen if your interested.

&&Nobody cared who I was til I picked up the axe.&&He's a big guy.&&https://i.imgur.com/WKBFIzq.png&&But, what if he put on the glasses?&&So what you're saying is no one cared who you were until you put on the mask?&&Paul Bettany who played Jarvis in Avengers: Age of Ultron, had a great quote about how he dealt with the makeup process:

>""Mainly the pain in the ass was the prosthetics and stuff that you know is as uncomfortable as getting paid a lot of money to be uncomfortable is, which is not really that uncomfortable,"" Bettany said.
>
>""It wasn’t even the putting it on — it was the sitting in it, you know. The putting it on — which took about three and a half hours — with prosthetics, makeup, and all of that, and then the suit ... It was the sitting in it. The first day was OK, and it wasn’t even the second day really, but the third day in a row and the fourth and the fifth day was … you had to really get kind of Zen about it, and meditate on the line of 1,000 actors behind you that would like to be in your position, you know?""

Basically just remember there may be 1,000s of other actors in line dying to be in this block buster movie, whenever you think the makeup is too uncomfortable.

People just do it anyway.&&Copyright law is, IMO, a lot simpler than most people seem to think it is. Generally, if you didn't make it, you need to get  permission from the person who did in order to use it. It is illegal to copy or disseminate creative work for which you do not hold the copyright. 

Now, there are some licenses that exist, such as to cover or perform songs in certain mediums, that complicate matters a little bit.

Edit: I'm not sure where I originally heard this but it might be wrong. In googling for a source to add to my post it appears he may have left the project because he had to do Graceland before they'd be done. There is also a rumor that he busted a nut in Nicole Kidman's hair and got kicked off the movie, which I had never heard.

Edit 2: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB5p3ZXg7V8) is where I heard it. Apparently it was the 68th take, though, not the 10th. My bad.

there was rumors of the allergy to the makeup, but also have read a theory that she was fired to make room for the 7 of 9 characters, which is why there was drama between Jerry Ryan and Kate Mulgrew.

also a deeper part of that theory was producers were going to fire Harry Kim's actor but last minute switch it to her instead because of the actor getting peoples 50 sexiest men alive listing that year, and being that his character was pretty much going to die that season finally, I think that theory has merit.

Clearly she was unhinged and as soon as her contract was up they dumped her from the show.   She does not attend and sci fi cons or reunion stuff.   Clearly there was a massive falling out.

Kes was also written out of the Star Trek Online game which is licenced by CBS and is considered cannon.  ie) they finish some stories like the Temporal Cold War with CBS approval.  The game includes the Delta Quadrent and Ecompans and mamy of the same charcters are in game including Harry, Neelix, The doctor, 7 of 9 and more all use thier original voice actors.   Not a single mention of Kes anywhere because CBS basically said 'no Kes' so they were not allowed even if they wanted to.  &&I wish they fired neelix instead of kes, fuck how I hate neelix&&The kid was asking a question about his 'favourite scene' and Rhys-Davies had a tendency to get off topic REALLY early on in his answers. After a while, the kid said ""That's great, but you didn't answer my question.""

""I liked the part where you got trampled by the wargs.""

(In character) ""A DWARF DOESN'T GET TRAMPLED, THAT'S PART OF THE STRATEGY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ELVISH SLANDER ---"" and so on. The entire room, which was PACKED, just loses their minds laughing. I've been going to this convention ever since 2010 when they launched it and that still sticks with me.

If you did not shed some tears when Neelix left the ship in the 3rd last episode you must be a heartless bugger. &&Yeah. It makes it worse for me that every now and again they showed the Neelix that would have been awesome. A streetwise hustler talking his way into and out of every situation in the book.

&&added to my comment above that she was also not included in the Star Trek Online game which is licenced by CBS and they approve the story line.   Not a single mention of Kes in whole game even though every other chracter has some sort of reference.  CBS put its foot down and said No Kes.  They really did not like her.

Likley that later episode in season6(?) had already been written while her contract was still valid.  Remember they do not in any way write all the episode in sequence rather they come up with a bunch of story lines and shoot according to availability and time required for set contruction.   Ie) she had probably did say 99 out of her contracted 100 eps  so there was a leftover.   And it was probably filmed long before it aired even a year or more.&&Neelix was one character that actually has fantastic growth throughout that show. He grows from a selfish, trickster, untrustworthy person only out for himself to an open, honest, caring and smart individual who's capable of leading an entire colony.&&Neelix’s character suffers from bad writing in the early seasons. Recently rewatched the show and forgot just how many of his arcs can be summed up with “Kes is hanging out with someone (usually Tom Paris),  Neelix is mad, Kes calls him out, Neelix says sorry”

Once Kes left and they started giving him more interaction with the other characters (particularly his interaction with Tuvok) he really starts to grow into his own. I agree, the final scene of him leaving pulls at the heart strings&&The world needs more Critic references. &&A lot of loyalty for a hired sword!&&Hey there, Woolsey&&Ah, yeah, sure, totally what I meant. &&Which would be roughly equivalent to a 150 year old human. I was slightly off but not by much, [Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Ocampa) has the average lifespan as nine years.&&Nelix is a great character but he has his bad rap for a reason. A bunch of things really contribute to the Nelix hate, but the writing itself sets him up to fail. It's a real shame since he's supposed to be a character you like and enjoy watching grow as a person. He spends too much time at the forefront of your mind as ""that annoying dick,"" because for a long time *he is,* AND he's always being forced into episodes with nothing to do with him thanks to running the mess (which is like the second most used set other than the bridge,) or used as the butt of a joke because ""Nelix' cooking,"" is a running joke. You never get to *not* deal with Nelix for an episode, and the crew's perception of him is set up to turn you against him.

Another part of the problem is that Nelix has by far the most drastic personal growth to overcome. Voyager is about growth as a person. Tom growing up and becoming a responsible adult and father, Harry growing up into a fine officer and commander, Seven rediscovering her humanity, The Doctor discovering his own humanity... All of these things are basically ""one step,"" problems. Nelix has to learn to become *someone else,* from who he already became in life. It's much more than just growing into who you are, it's changing who you've already become as a person. Nelix does it over the longest possible period of time, under the most scrutiny, without any free passes due to being a young and sexy individual, edit: or having an excuse like being a hologram (not that picardo isn't dashing.)&&Sort of but not entirely,  there is that one episode in seaso  2 all about him when he gets involved with drug dealers and in over his head trying to get a map of th nekrid expanse.

Just kidding March last year was god damn incredible for movie releases &&Disney, push Solo to early August where there is almost no competition that month. Guardians of The Galaxy 1 and even Suicide Squad made a lot of money in that slot. I’m sure a SW movie would. 

Then, Fox, take your movie and movie it to May 25th. This gives Infinity War three weeks to make a good amount of money before Deadpool comes out, and this gives Deadpool three weeks to make a good amount of money before Incredibles 2 comes out. 

Everyone wins. &&X did gave it to us afterall!&&What an awful date for them...&&Personally I'm bummed that this and Slender Man are now on the same day. I'm excited for both.&&Oh kick ass, I get to see Deadpool one day, then the next I get to graduate with my masters in social work. Gonna be a bitchin’ weekend!&&Solo should move to December. Star Wars should always be December.&&Im beyond excited for this fucking sequel,time for my 20th rewatch of Deadpool 1 while I wait&&Romantic story time. 

I can honestly say deadpool helped contribute to me being a father. My girlfriend and I went to an early valentines dinner in enough time to make the later showing of deadpool and still hit the liquor store before they closed for some wine for back home. We both ended up getting pretty drunk and I broke all safety protocols. Few weeks later when my gf broke the news to me I was pretty baffled. I've been the pullout king for years to the point I was starting to think I may be either the best ever or just sterile. Both of us sat there trying to figure out when this could've happened and at pretty much the exact same time said ""Valentine's Day"". We both really like that movie so much that any time we watch it or see a reference to deadpool my gf reminds me of that being the night we made a kid. I know it's the first thought that pops into my head. My daughter was born 11/1/16 and is the best thing that's ever happened to both of us. We'd been dating for a couple years and we're already planning on moving in together so we ended up buying a small house together and have been happy ever since. If I have a second kid because of a deadpool movie I'll name it Wade regardless of gender. &&Welp, pack it up folks. Solo is going to be pushed back. &&My only qualm with this is that Deadpool 2 was originally going to be released on the night of my 21st birthday. Gotta find something else to do now&&I’m not even that excited for Deadpool 2 unlike the first. The most upsetting news in this release date shake up is Fox pushing back The New Mutants from early this year to next year. That’s incredibly disappointing. Still excited though.&&I like how Deadpool went from the movie that Hollywood did not want to green light because THEY believed it would not be profitable to the movie that now dates might have to be moved to not lose revenue competing against. &&14 days after Infinity War, RIP wallet&&I kinda wished they pushed back the release date for Deadpool 2 instead of pushing it forward (especially given how it means the same reason I waited for Deadpool to come out on DVD before watching the film is also going to affect this film).&&Ooo, I like the [cutlery](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTSgvydW0AEKVL7.jpg). My nethers are all tingly!&&Brave.&&They are stupid to release this two weeks after Infinity war. All it does is damage the box office potential for the film...&&Oof, isnt that two weeks after Infinity War?&&Why was the previous thread on this, and New Mutants getting delayed removed? &&BS. My theater has 1 Imax theater and one Dolby theater. They usually have the same movie in it too. Boooo! Wanted DP on the Dolby.  &&as if my birthday couldn't get any better. Avengers, Dead Pool, potentially a good or terrible Han Solo movie and potentially a good or terrible Pacific Rim all being released in the same month here.&&Disney must be changing relaese date for solo only way thsi could make sense&&I'm just curious what material his gloves are made of &&For some reason I can’t read what his swords say...can anyone clue me in? LOL&&Do those say Bea Arthur? Asking for a friend.&&I used to only go to movies when it was a cool movie such as Deadpool or something equally awesome that might be in 3D.  Lately it seems like the percentage of awesome movies coming out is going up at a crazy rate as I'm definitely going to theaters more often now!  Damn you movie companies for giving us what we want and taking our money! :-p&&They need to do a spoof of that Sixth Sense scene with ""I see deadpool. Everywhere.""&&Well happy fucking birthday to me!&&I'm deadly curious as to how they're gonna top their intro compared to the first deadpool movie.&&Oooh moved to my cake day! I know what i want this year...&& No.  Not the 18th. Well it’s all downhill from here folks. &&I'm going to see each on opening night and then will have a sweet day at the beginning of June where I watch Infinity War, Deadpool 2, and Solo.

&&I took a closer look at the swords and laughed so hard I almost woke my SO. Just another nice touch that makes me more hyped to see the movie.&&This is REALLY bad for Deadpool. Infinity War and Solo will complicate so much it's domestic gross. Not sure why Fox did this, but well, that's a bad thing for sure.&&This is actually a bad idea.  Releasing in February for Valentines Day is the reason they had those record setting weeks.  Dropping in the middle of blockbuster season means its gonna go for a week or two then drop off.  They would make more money in February.  Hell this movie was basically set to make a billion dollars and now with this change it may not even match the originals performance. &&They know that no one gives a shit about Solo.&&I liked Deadpool 2 because it lived up to the original & did some new things as well. I still like the first one better but this one is good too. [This](https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/deadpool-2/) covers it all for me.&&Trying to get their movies out before the sexual allegations start flying. &&Oh man haha I can't wait to pay money to sit for two hours and listen to some autistic edgy spiderman joke about drugs and masturbation fucking hyped already&&Yay! I know where I'm going for my birthday :)&&It's VERY likely Solo will get pushed back &&I don’t get it. If Disney owns all three of these franchises, wouldn’t they want to spread out the releases so that they don’t compete with their own stuff and make more money?&&gotta ride that hype wave.&&I'd bet my life on Solo getting pushed back. &&It's so he can appear as a cameo in his own movie, with cardboard cutouts of the infinity cast.&&This doesn't make any sense. Can Simeone explain why they would do this? The ultimate sacrifice to Disney?!&&Thanks, that's always my first question anytime anybody posts a move date for release. I wish people would out it in the title like moved from ___ to ___.&&Ouch to VFX artists and all post production. :(&&Josh Brolin will be a busy guy doing promo stuff for both films.&&If this is meant to be counter-programming with Deadpool picking up the adult audiences while families hit up Infinity War, it still feels really risky given that a) Infinity War will be popular with the adult crowd and b) since they're both superhero movies it doesn't feel like you have a choice between two v different properties. &&Well, I'm probably going to watch both. There's no way I'm missing out on either one.&&Why was the other news thread about all of the date changes deleted? Wtf Mods?&&And Star Wars.&&Deadpool gonna eat solo alive!!!&&And Solo.&&I was hoping this announcement wasn’t that Deadpool 2 was releasing on may 18th but that he was going to be in infinity war  &&ugh, tell me about it.. a few weeks crammed so much you cant watch it all and then a dryness when almost nothing is coming out at all.&&There are always movies worth seeing. The Shape of Water and Three Billboards were amazing, the problem is it's so expensive to go to the movies, people just opt for the blockbusters. &&The worst part of this is not even moviepass can do any justice. I will usually shed the money for 3D or IMAX for a superhero/SW type movie only since moviepass won't cover it. This is $60 in one month smh hopefully I won't need my AC until june 1st.&&And they wonder why there’s so many theaters closing...&&I posted this elsewhere, but... Fox is maybe trying to push Solo to Memorial Day perhaps? Best theory I've heard so far.&&Hubris.&&Let them fight&&It makes no sense.&&When people see a movie they enjoy they are *more* likely to go see another movie he next weekend.

Because IW has good tracking they want DP close enough to get the run-off from IW’s viewers, but not close enough where they are directly competing with IW.


My guess is that Solo is tracking lower because TLJ had some weird mixed reactions. Also, now that Disney owns 90% of everyones childhood they might have told Fox that the Solo release is getting moved out to memorial weekend.&&The logistics? Print new posters, notify theaters, ship/deliver movie earlier. Move forward marketing, interviews, AMA, etc. &&My poor discretionary fund.  Im gonna see all of those in theaters.  Though from what Ive heard about peoples expectations of Solo I wish it would release in order of Solo first, DP2 second and then Infinity Wars.  God damn, I never could have predicted being more hype for a Fox-made marvel movie sequel than a movie about Han Solo.&&I still don't get it either.

Is Deadpool 2 under FOX right now or has it already moved over to Disney?

Either way (whether FOX or Disney decided this), the original spot they had was better imo. Now, SOLO might just eat up a lot of Deadpool 2's business (as well as Infinity War probably crushing records and stealing box office money too)

Very odd move.&&i dont think it will make a huge difference, but some people are forgetting incredibles two&&You mean ""logic"".&&[deleted]&&That's a hell of a delay&&Why would they do that? The movie already finished filming, and it has a trailer. &&Really bummed it's going to just be shelved till 2019. &&So it must be good!&&Yeahhhhh boiiii! Me too!&&It's my fucking 21st birthday!

https://twitter.com/theinsneider/status/951560770168397824&&I heard the reshoots are to make New Mutants scarier. To make it a full-fledged horror movie. &&Thought this was weird too.... Then I remembered mines on 19th.

Fun Fact - Wade Wilson was wearing a Bea Arthur shirt in the first movie, while he was out and about Merc-ing/going on his first date with Vanessa. 

The studio paid like $10,000 to the Arthur Estate for the rights to the shirt.&&Remember the cross promotion they did with Betty White before the first release? 

Who was Betty White's mortal enemy?  That's right.  Her.

&&MoviePass, yo &&It's almost like they got bought out and have no reason to care.&&Lol @ you thinking Solo will do better than DP2&&Trailer? Why weren't you sold on Bob Ross?&&There's no way solo is coming out on schedule&&Incredibles is June not May&&I honestly don't know. It seems like a huge mistake to hedge your bets on a sequel to Deadpool (an above-average-to-great-depending-on-who-you-ask first movie for a superhero tbf) to win out over **A FUCKING HAN SOLO MOVIE.** A movie all about one of the most popular characters in the one of most popular franchises ever. [**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8YOBvq-jc) It's also competing with **ANOTHER** highly anticipated blockbuster to a massively successful and beloved franchise. How highly anticipated? How about **6 FUCKING YEARS.** I'm sorry if this seems like an overreaction, it probably is. But what the fuck is wrong with FOX's decision makers? Are they using the executive glue huffing bags a little too much? They just look up from their big piles of blow long enough to shoot their company in the leg? Do they **want** these films to either suck or just bomb in their opening weeks? Because if a bunch of people on the internet can see a **HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM** with this plan, **WHY CAN'T THEY?**&&Dude, Star Wars were the creators of ""summer blockbuster"" term.&&I feel sorry for your son's origin story.&&>I've been the pullout king for years

Jesus fucking Christ. Do people really think pulling out is a contraceptive?

It's between Infinity War and Solo. It's a major draw, but how well will it perform amongst adults vs iw/s with the general public&&Not at all. Posters just hit theaters with a May 25th release date. &&Did you just look at a post from a week ago and make a VERY bold claim based on nothing but the speculation of a few people on a default subreddit? &&Why do people keep saying this? It would have been pushed back months and months ago. &&What makes you say that? Star Wars doesn't need promo the same way other films do. They probably don't want it too associated with last Jedi and want it to stand on its own so a trailer will probably drop at the super bowl or something &&Can we please stop saying this. Solos isn’t moving anywhere&&Lol sorry but do you really think they should be afraid for people to go see Deadpool instead of the Solo movie?&&Not sure, maybe since they technically don't own Fox yet? But yeah, that does seem odd.&&They doesn't own Deadpool yet, those mergers takes a few years to get done, it hasn't been authorized by the authorities yet. It's at least 18 months apparently.&&That could take years and could easily be blocked like AT&T/Time Warner. For now they're still competitors.&&Are they really though? Fans of the IP will see it immediately and maybe more then once. A few weeks later, they move to a other IP.

People that wait to see one, will probably also wait to see the other one. As long as they are 2-3 weeks apart, they wouldn't really cannibalize themselves.&&Because Fox thinks they can compete and want to prove their worth in the ongoing negotiations. &&As /u/thesmash notes, Disney don't fully or definitely own Fox yet. Needs to be sorted out first by regulatory bodies.

Deadpool 2 is a very different demographic to Infinity War, though Solo'd be a similar demo to Infinity War.

So, all of them should be successful anyway. But surely two of three.&&!Remindme 5 months&&Disney stumbled into a nice December release window with the last 3 Star Wars films. In general, it doesn't make sense to not just stick to that with their yearly film.&&Why exactly? I would think Solo has had very few details because TLJ is still in the theaters.

I’m guessing July could have been possible (Marvel pulled off the May/July/November schedule last year) but they might not have been super confident in it in that slot for whatever reason. 

It kinda makes sense, and avoids anything as baffling as Disney releasing Infinity War and Solo so close together. &&[deleted]&&Allegedly they're delaying because they're going to do reshoots to add more horror to the film, because ""It"" and ""Get Out"" were some of the biggest movies last year.&&May 18thers unite!

I’m actually OK with this - a terrifying horror film involving mutants and set in the X-Men universe sounds pretty great: I like how Fox is embracing different genres for their R-rated mutant films: Deadpool was a comedy, Logan was a western, and The New Mutants is a horror film.&&wait.. what?

Thanks kind Redditor. :)&&I mean new mutants has a trailer and posters and it just got pushed back to feb 2019&&You have no idea how little that matters. A friend of mine has the poster for Shutter Island with the original October release on it. Paramount decided in late August to push the release date from October 2, 2009 to February 19, 2010, so less than two months before it was scheduled to be released.

For companies like Disney, posters are among the cheapest things to produce as far as advertising goes.&&Which posters? The one that just says Solo? My theater I work at has had that poster for a while now. Could be an outdated poster.&&That's madness, they reshot the entire thing, the buzz is mostly negative and they're still opening it next to Infinity War and Deadpool 2?&&which makes no sense&&Psh, I work at a movie theater and we get posters for movies that never even come out. Paper means nothing to these people. They’d send out updated sheets in a heartbeat if they felt like the movie needed more time. &&They're doing another round of reshoots.   There is zero chance this doesn't get pushed.&&At this point I think that Disney just gave up on the movie and is doing everything to have it euthanized and forgotten ASAP.

Who knows, if people pay too much attention to the bomb it may even hurt a little bit the cash cow that Star Wars usually is.&&Any pics?&&Add to this Ron Howard is really happy with the movie and I think we are all going to be pleasantly surprised. They just aren’t marketing it because they are testing something. 

Imagine if they can cut the costs of future Star Wars movies because they know they will market themselves. It would immediately halve cost of production. &&It’s not entirely uncommon for a movie to get pushed back even once there are posters with a release date. Sometimes movie theatres are told to take down the marketing materials, other times the distributor sends little stickers to put over the date. This happened with The Space Between Is, for example. &&[deleted]&&and everyone believed him&&Says who? Movies have been pushed back closer than this and no trailer means that general audiences aren't even aware that this movie exists. &&Like New Mutants would have been pushed back months and months ago? Oh wait, that was already advertised for April and just got pushed to NEXT YEAR.&&Yeah also let's be honest is starting they marketing so much in advance even necessary? It's pretty logic to assume you get more value for your marketing dollar when you do it close to release. And considering the big cost of that movie (similar to the others SW movies and inflated by reshoots), they may want to optimize their marketing spend. &&I think he’s also adding in the whole director fiasco a couple months ago &&They don’t technically own them yet since it has to go through government approval.&&But still, this move seems like Fox is trying to damage sale.&&As far as the film's distributed by Disney, it makes absolute sense for them to release a new film every 3 weeks during the summer season.  

Disney has been forcing a 3 week window on theatres for their new Marvel releases since Iron Max 3, and they've been doing it for Pixar and Star Wars as well.  By releasing Solo 3 weeks after Avengers and 4 weeks before Incredibles 2, which is 3 weeks before Ant-Man and the Wasp.

If they were to move Solo, it would allow theatres to put a non-Disney film into their largest screen during this crowded and lucrative season, potentially interfering with their other films on the schedule from getting access to those largest screens in turn.

I'd argue that this is a monopolistic anti-competitive tactic that undermines how studios aren't supposed to be able to own/control theatres and what films they show, but they've been doing it for a few years now and will soon have a much larger slate of films that could be given this sort of preferential treatment with the Fox merger.&&!RemindMe 1 day&&iirc the past three films actually had an original release date around April-May, but they were all pushed back.&&Yeah I will so watch DP over solo.&&Disney is buying Fox. 

Why would they be making those kinds of plays. &&He wanted Simeone to explain, not you.&&I wonder if Fox assumed like many of us it could just move to the Christmas period. I still think it might, with the lack of promo and all.&&True and Thanos is under a lot of makeup.

That said he's also the main villain of probably the most hyped Superhero movie ever made.

Deadpool 2 will do great but Infinity War is going to be the big one this year&&Yeah, I'm getting movie pass for the entire family for May-August. It will keep the kids busy and it's a killer deal for that time of year. &&MoviePass users are the real winners always&&I’ve seen a bunch of movies I would never have seen and a couple of movies multiple times because of movie pass. Love it. Hope they don’t go out of business. &&It won’t bomb, it has Star Wars attached to it. Will it underperform for Star Wars standards? Possibly, but it’ll still do fairly well by normal standards&&Why do people hate so hard on a movie we don’t even have a trailer for yet?

Already answered

>Fox is maybe trying to push Solo to Memorial Day&&Rumor is they want it bundled against Infinity to pad quarterly numbers &&Habibi &&Very Deadpool humour. Fair play.&&Especially when it was Fox's idea to sell &&Rumor is that they're delaying because they're going to do some heavy reshoots, and it's pushed back so far because that's the only way all the actors' schedules line up.&&It's interesting that both of the R-Rated X-Men movies have had schedule changes only a couple of weeks after Disney acquired Fox. I don't know what it means but it's interesting nonetheless.&&well probably.trailer wasnt too good.&&February is kind of the dumping ground month too, which probably isn't a great sign.&&thats how I love to decide what to do with my movie, use three year old data &&We did it!&&I'm 100% down with them doing that. We need more clever scary films, less just mildly creepy films &&Gambit is supposed to be a heist movie too.&&Marvel's laid the groundwork for superhero-themed genre films and everyone can see how far they've ran with it. And if Fox can put out great movies this way too, that's great.

Now the question is if this is part of WB's problem or not on their end...&&I saw the trailer for New Mutants last month in the theater and thought it looked remarkably scary for a superhero movie. It was actually quite shocking. Kind of neat to see Fox Studios get a little grittier and more experimental in order to differentiate themselves from the MCU. &&Good thing Disney is gonna scrap all that and make movies filled with quips&&Is new mutants rated R?&&They are supposed to be basing some of New Mutants on the Demon Bear story arc - which is most decidedly not light or funny - glad they are going for a darker feel on this one&&Despite all the worrying, it seems Fox might have actually learned the right lesson from Deadpool.

Let's say 4th of July babies&&Literally every SW movie before the Disney acquisition was in May. Times have changed, though, and I do like the December releases. &&Deadpool is a big fan of older ladies.  He's into the Golden Girls, he loves the movie Cocoon, and he's into classic bombshell actresses. 

That being said, he's also into Harry Potter, Adventure Time and Star Wars. &&I prefer mature women. They have experience. And know how to have a good time. 

Also something about getting your dick sucked by a woman with removable teeth is sexy.&&UK? Cineworld Unlimited pass, yo.&&Happy cake day!&&This will be the 3rd weekend for Infinity War though. The last Avengers film made 38m on its third weekend, and Civil War (basically an Avengers film) made 32m. So there's still room for a big opening for Deadpool 2.&&Jumanji was released a week after The Last Jedi and just before Christmas and now has a ~$533m international boxoffice...Deadpool ended up at ~$783m internationally but regardless, under the right conditions Deadpool 2 might flurish despite being released around Solo.&&I'm a big star wars fan and I will say there is certainly no where near the normal Star wars hype behind it. It feels a lot like its going to get pushed back. &&Not really. Most either aren't interested in learning more about Han Solo's past while others, like me, just never cared for Han Solo all that much to begin with.

That being said Rogue One I don't think anyone expected to be as good as it was so who knows.&&We’re currently 4 months before release and we have received nearly no promotional material. No trailer and the poster is lackluster to say the least. Also, the rumors of what is going on behind production are not great either.&&You're incredible! In fact you're so incredible I'm going to invite you for an incredible time watching the Incredibles with me in person!

Actually tho.. all my friends moved away and I need you in my life 😥&&Wtf I went 3 months without knowing there was a damn New Mutants trailer ....&&Do the ads have the date on them?&&Are you serious? I was really hype for this.&&Whaaaat? First I've heard of that.&&Wait.. I missed this. 

It looked interesting and all. &&wait, it did?  Shit.&&It got pushed almost a year? Fuckkkkk &&I feel like people here will disagree but it kind of looked pretty lame so hopefully they can fix it.&&Jesus, it was going to release in 3 months, and they delayed it by almost a year.&&Wait really??&&No, are you fucking serious? I was so excited for that film. I guess I missed that news.&&Wait what? That's pretty stupid. &&...WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS OH MY GOD I WAS SO EXCITED UGHHH&&If it got pushed that far there must be a problem with the film.   There’s no way that’s because of a conflicting issue.  &&And RIP Gambit...&&I've got a suspicion they pushed it back to lower it to PG-13 and add it into the MCUs overall story :\&&Yeah, G.I. Joe: Retaliation had trailers, posters, toys ahead of its summer release. Paramount pushed it back to the next March anyway.&&Remind me to never save the date on any disney wedding invites. 
Fucking cheap ass Cinderella only invited us to the dancing and drink portion of the wedding anyways!&&Yes sir. &&It sounds like they might be cutting their losses, especially with the complete lack of marketing.&&Kind of a tinfoil hat theory, but releasing Solo and Infinity War may be a good idea. Both are ultimately controlled by Disney. If Solo flops, you can simply say Infinity War was *that* good. &&Ridley Scott will step in to fix it in 10 days with some duct tape, $10 million and Christopher Plummer in a black vest.&&Why?&&They’re doing pickups, which happen for virtually every movie during post. &&Nothing has bombed, nor will bomb with Star Wars on it. &&They could put a trailer up on YouTube a month before it's released. It would get about 10 million views on day one and word of mouth would spread it from there &&Yeah, and antitrust stuff takes time. I work at Dell, and when Dell and EMC merged we had to wait through antitrust approval for not just the US, but many many countries that we did business with. India took forever, easily 6-10 months if I recall correctly. &&Or Disney itself. Know the story about Treasure Planet? Smell smth similar with the solo movie here. Nearly no promotional material and a placement next to movies with a very high expectation in terms of income...&&Like I said, they stumbled into it.&&r/nocontext&&That means two things&&Depends on the mood. &&Phrasing!&&I'll MoviePass both twice.&&I will watch them both.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAj26rVWK14&&Ahhhhh this is one of those entendres &&I don't like watching DP because now all your seeing are two men's butts, and the woman's skin is now like looking at a boob without nipples. You don't see any features.&&Fucking brilliant. &&My money's on Disney knowing Solo is gonna bomb, so they're moving Deadpool ahead of it to blame it on the lower audience numbers.&&They're still competitors and are obligated to act as competitors. The deal might still be blocked, it'd be silly if they started to coordinate now.&&But then why move up two weekends and closer to the likely juggernaut Avenger 3. The new slot is only 2 weeks behind Infinite War.&&Or August. There's literally never any good movies in August. It's why Suicide Squad and Guardians of the galaxy did amazing.&&I say 1.5 bil, easy. If Civil War made close to that, Avengers will top it most definitely&&Not sure if you know but Moviepass has a waiting period of 9 months if you cancel and want to resub. They added it onto their ToS after the huge influx.&&By the way, you can only have two moviepass subscriptions per address&&Also definitely get that going in advance. I got Moviepass for Christmas and my card *still* hasn't come in. They say two weeks but I think it's closer to 3-4.&&Get it from costco. For $89. You get 12 months sub + 12 months sub for a movie streaming site (forgot the name). My friend got his card in 2 weeks.&&I love me some Star Wars but I don't think the Solo movie needed to exist and I have no excitement for it whatsoever. Doesn't mean it can't be good of course, but... Bleh.&&Fairly well is basically a failure in Hollywood these days. If you don't double up you are screwed.&&Apart from the holiday special, has any official Starwars movie or series bombed? Even those ewok movies were pretty universally watched by kids when they came out.&&It's a combination of people not wanting the film in the first place but also just the shedload of development hell surrounding the project. I'm not necessarily writing it off, if the script is genuinely solid then I think that Ron Howard could make it work, but there's enough smoke here for someone to confidentially assume that something has caught fire. &&The fact we don't have a trailer yet is really worrisome.&&Possibly because if Disney had any real faith at all in the movie they would have rolled out a promo campaign for it by now. Their silence speaks volumes in this case. I'll still see it, but I'm not too optimistic about it.&&It is a movie no one asked for about a beloved character whose success is closely tied to it's actor's performance and charisma.  We love Han Solo as is, we don't need to know his past. He's a smuggler when we meet him and grows as a person in ANH, we don't need him in some heroic adventure before ANH. The production issues just make the situation even worse. I love Star Wars, since TPM I've been going to every SW movie on it's release day, I go to JediCon every year, I watch the TV series(and watched all previous ones), I'm building a BB8 and have a huge collection of the books and comics and neither I or any of the friends I share this interest with are excited about the movie, we are worried by how it will change Han's character. Fans have been asking for a Kenobi movie for a while, and Ewan has said repeatedly that he would love to be back on character, I don't understand why make a movie no one asked for when you have one that people would be eager to watch.&&Nope I have seen Thor 3 times and others a couple times.&&My understanding was only limited to 1 movie a day.&&It used to be like that IIRC, but now you can see it as many times as you want.&&Careful, Donald&&Nailed it.&&I'm kind of stoked on the Too Many Spider-Men movie. I figure it might be the only way I'll ever see Ben Reilly or Kaine on the big screen.&&Mary Poppins Returns?  Do you mean Guardians of the Galaxy 3?&&There’s also the Bumblebee movie and that Freddie Mercury biopic. &&Dude that animated Spiderman looks like it's gonna be the fuckin *shit* tho &&Mortal engines is opening then tbf&&I agree, December makes the most sense. Parents will take their kids to see Mary Poppings between Christmas and New Years. Aquaman would under perform next to SOLO and an animated Spider-man just doesn't have the same appeal of the live action flick. &&Hopefully if they do reshoots it improves the movie, the trailer at least was fairly generic and uninteresting&&I heard they didn't want risk using CGI to remove Anya-Taylor Joy's mustache which she grew for her next role.&&Disney hasn't acquired fox.  They put in an offer to buy them.  It could still be denied, and will probably take a year.&&Disney hasn't acquired Fox yet, that deal will take months to go through&&I thought it looked pretty entertaining actually, but part of that might just be because it was different. I didn't know anything about it so I was expecting it to turn into a standard x-men action movie any second. &&The Cajun Job&&I genuinely think that if it is a heist movie they should pay Soderbergh a fuckton to get him onboard, it'd be huge. Not his usual scene but I'm sure Channing Tatum has goodwill with him.&&Didn’t know much about this movie before but this definitely makes me want to go see it now. &&Haha it’s alright, I’m just glad you didn’t say “St Patty’s day” lol&&Wait, so.. I'm Deadpool? &&Maple Land 🍁&&Thank you!! 😊&&I think fatigue might be an issue. Even if it goes down, I think there are a lot of people who won't feel like going to see two superhero movies in a month.&&It should.  August is ripe for the taking this year.&&If this was a Obi Wan movie I'd be all over it. Han is fine but I've never understood all the love he gets.&&Honestly I'm not worried, say they started releasing trailers at the three months mark, they'd be able to to release a trailer a month until the movie dropped and it'd be fresh in every one's mind. Personally, I hate having a trailer or something drop like 6 months before it comes out. ""Oh, guess I'll be happy to go see this in half a damn year!""&&This made me sad :-(&&I'm ok with blockbusters being spread throughout the year.  I mean, I'm going to watch these movies in the theater.&&Well, now you've a nice, creepy trailer to watch. Though a long time to wait, unfortunately.&&I just learned about it now from these comments.&&Yes. They say April 13th

E: the trailer also says April 13th&&I think they may just have the year “2018” on them.&&[deleted]&&Yeah dude so was I. Pretty ticked about it. &&Rumors are they want to do reshoots to make it scarier. Plus if they introduced mutants into the mcu with new mutants that would be kind of a weird choice. &&I don't think this would work in modern times. With the internet and all, if Solo is shit, people are going to know.&&They're hedging?&&And he'll re-shoot enough to be considered for Best Director.&&Beautiful&&Finally, a good use of it!&&Thatsthejoke.jpg&&I'll take DP any day.&&That is why you have to keep destroying him. So you can get a clear view in between DP rebuilding himself.&&I find it hard to believe it bombs. It may not be good but I guarantee it makes money.&&Oh come on...why does his sub get dumb when it comes to Star Wars? No way Solo bombs, Star Wars is too strong of a franchise &&Disney doesn't own Fox yet, this is some weird Fox tactic&&I didnt know that, thanks! I havent bought it at all and was waiting to get it until it was the most cost effective, but that is really good to know. &&Also 2 per address&&How exactly is that enforced?

Do they require verified ID? Unique debit card numbers or addresses? I don’t doubt it’s true it just seems hard to enforce. I assume I’m missing something.&&I completely agree. It’s a cash grab&&Nothing made after ROTJ needed to exist&&I think there is no promotional material because they are still riding the TLJ train, they want people to see that now while it's in cinemas then get excited for something that's coming out in 5 months &&Too Many Spider-Men movie? Can’t believe they’re finally adapting the hit broadway musical, especially after the accident!&&That Vince Staples song in the trailer got me really hyped&&Guardians of The Galaxy III: The Search for Yondu&&Mary Poppins? Is he cool?&&Transformers isn't as popular as it used to be. &&That biopic is still being made?&&These reshoots are apparently going to make the movie more straight up horror. They decided to do this because test screenings were only okay, and ""It"" made a bunch of money last year.&&Oh, really? I thought the purchase was final, I know the legalities will take months to resolve but I was under the impression that the trade was official.&&We're *all* Deadpool. &&[ShowGO](http://showgo.ca/) (Not sure if it's out of limited 'beta' access yet).&&NP your welcome&&I mean he's okay but like........he's no Obi-Wan, or Vader.&&May is gonna be fuckin' crazy tho&&Ooh, I wonder what happened to that movie to get it pushed back almost a full year? And into the dumping ground month, no less.

edit: pls send 50 more messages about how it's not the dumping ground because a film came out then and did well.&&Nope, they say April 13th&&They say April 13th, source: I manage a movie theater that currently has the poster on display. &&How was it?&&> if Solo is shit, people are going to ~~know~~ defend it to the death anyway

&&Plus wouldn't Disney rather make *some* money off the movie? I mean it's not cheap to make a Blockbuster these days and especially not a Star Wars film. I doubt any company would purposefully fuck their 100 million dollar movie like that lol.&&And Plummer will win an award for his performance&&[deleted]&&( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&https://i.imgur.com/8CsMlBk.jpg&&My house, 10?&&Yeah but now all you see is cancerous cock.&&Reportedly the movie's budget doubled due to all the reshoots. When you factor in marketing, it is very easy to see how it could bomb if it doesn't gain traction. &&Bomb in the sense that it will not live up to expectations from the execs themselves.  The movie releases in 4 months and we have...what, a poster to show for the marketing campaign?  After the divisiveness and underperforming numbers for TLJ, coupled with the reshoots and directing nightmares we've all been hearing about regarding Solo, it's no wonder they're playing it safe this way.&&The sub likes to circlejerk and pretend the recent trilogy was an absolute failure despite it making more money than pretty much any Star Wars movie.&&They ran a holiday deal where instead of the monthly fee, you could pay $69 for a full year. &&Just use a different email. Idk if this thing started up just now but initially I couldn't get my card for a month so I re-subscribed with a different email and got it within a week. &&we have three at my house and they all work 

*shrugs*&&Addresses, names, email addresses I presume. &&Things that offer free trials typically go  by debit card number, so I'd assume that.&&Yeah and really just market it in the 4 months before release should be enough. We don't need trailer a year in advance for movies to be a success.&&Titus will be ecstatic.&&Spider-Man faces his two biggest foes: gravity and floors.&&Hell yeah he's cool.&&It’s still one more movie to deal with, and given that the Han Solo movie doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of hype going for itself, I’m not sure it’d be a great idea throwing it into a month that already has some big releases.&&at first I thought he meant there was gonna be a Bee Movie 2&&Yeah, but this one isn't a Michael Bay film. Could actually be good.&&It was delayed so many times, but it has an apparently set release date in December, with Rami Malek as Freddie. &&Thank god. I really want to watch a 100% horror/superhero flick.&&Nothing is official until that day.  Disney does not own any fox assets yet.  Shares have not traded.  Now, Fox could allow their assets to be used by Disney, but they still don't own them yet.&&I thought I was Spartacus.&&On this blessed day :)&&speak for yourself&&Yeah exactly. Plus if they did an Obi-Wan they could use the actual actor.&&Its weird. Its just Disney competing with itself.&&It's so jam packed, Smuckers got hard looking at the calender.&&I think she has been fucking crazy for a while. I mean, have you seen Agents of Shield?&&Seems like such a weird movie to me.  It's supposed to be in the current X-Men universe, right?  Not the the X-Men franchise has any track record of being remotely consistent, but this seems like a big departure.  Perhaps they pushed it back to rework it to fit into the MCU?  Either way it feels so tonally different from any other X-Men movie that I was really shocked to see that it is indeed an X-Men movie&&They figured people liked horror elements because of IT, so reshoots to make it scarier.&&Feb isnt really a dumping ground anymore&&Could have been pushed back [one less month.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbsKwnshcTM)&&Didn't Deadpool open in February?&&February is gradually becoming less and less of a dumping ground. I think studios are realizing that as of now February (and January and March to some extent) is pretty much an open field and the perfect time to have a money maker shock people. &&[deleted]&&Solo is a project they had to do to as part of the deal to get kasdan to help write episode 7.

I think Disney has been aware since announcement that its not the most wanted concept by the fanbase.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Riskiest link I'm clicking at work today.&&>When you factor in marketing

What marketing? &&It’s not going to happen. The late 99’s early 00’s trilogy sucked ass and all grossed over $300 million...top 15 all time at that time. Rogue One was about relative no ones and grossed $500m. 


Solo will make $300 million easily even if it’s terrible movie (think 6.0 IMDB). If it’s a decent movie, it will easily make $400 million. $500m easily if it’s a good movie 
&&What marketing? &&Disney said from the get go that The Force Awakens benefitted from ""pent up demand"", indicating that they knew not to expect a better performance from TLJ than TFA.

There have been 3 Star Wars films in the last 3ish years, and none for a decade or so before that. And none with the stars of the original trilogy for ~30 years before TFA.

Not really fair to TLJ to expect more than what it delivered, regardless of the film's own strengths and weaknesses. I really can't say it underperformed or disappointed financially, and I don't really think Disney is disappointed. It trends quite closely with the drops ESB and AotC saw after ANH and TPM.

There's just no way they're going to keep blowing out records if they keep pumping out a film a year. Fatigue will set in and numbers will continue to drop and stabilize. &&Last Jedi? Underpreforming?

You do realize it's the 2nd biggest film in the franchise right?&&A Solo ‘Bomb’ will make about as much or more than Dead Pool made 

So if Solo sucks, it will likely make more than DP2


>After the divisiveness and underperforming numbers for TLJ


And yet it will make way over $600 million domestic. Top 4 all time &&Underperforming numbers?

It's the 6th highest grossing film domestically of all time, and second highest Star Wars film, I think they're okay.

&&>The sub likes to circlejerk and pretend the recent trilogy was an absolute failure despite it making more money than pretty much any movie.

FIFY&&Yeah I think it was like $89.95for annual which was like $6.95 monthly plus like a $6 fee or something but it's a great deal regardless&&Yeah, but they didn't allow everyone to get it. I couldn't go through with the purchase, and my girlfriend *did*, but then they sent her an email a month later saying they weren't moving her account to the yearly. 

Operationally, they are a complete shit storm of a company. &&https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHKvjqt5pssL99C/giphy.gif&&**I'M MARY POPPINS, Y'ALL**&&I agree that Solo doesn't have alot of hype right now, mostly because we've been hyped up for 8. I see this as even more of a reason to push it back. If you pushed Solo back it would give us more time to cool down off 8 and build hype for Solo.&&Bee Movie 2: Electric Bumbaloo&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeMOHE41UA4

Only good thing in that entire movie&&They're getting so rich they can barely handle it.&&The strange thing is that Deadpool will soon be a Disney property&&The best kind of competition! They type you're guaranteed to win! 


(It's terrible for consumers for Disney to be this huge)&&Guess who wins!&&[Jammed, you say?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcArnepkhv0)&&Fox never overly cared about continuity in the X-Men films. None of them really line up that well. New Mutants is just it's own X-Men film like Logan. &&I think the new mutants movie takes place in Limbo.  A realm of lovecraftian horror and sorcery.  That girl from Split is playing the mutant that went evil and became queen of limbo in the comics&&At some point I think they just focused on making good films rather than being consistent. X-men lost consistency a while ago. Logan stands on its own. Doesn’t upset me because it was a great movie &&New Mutants' Demon Bear story line, told properly, is a horror story&&I am so very much the target audience for this movie. Horror? Yup. Superhero? Yup. Someone from Game of Thrones? Yup!&&February 14th. Valentine's Day. &&February is the lousiest month of the year. It's the time that I don't really want to go out and do anything, but I would want to go to theaters to watch some good movies.&&Are you allowed to compare it to another film? How ""horror"" is it? And what kind of horror? (paranormal/slasher/demons/ghosts/etc?) &&lol this dude gonna wake up with a Mickey Mouse head carved into his chest “as a warning”&&Were they aiming for PG-13 or R from the version you saw.&&I never knew that. Do you have a source for that? Not sure why they'd have to do this film for that.&&> Rogue One was about relative no ones and grossed $500m. 

And was easily my favorite of the new movies, so far&&That's what people said about Avengers in 2012, then 2014, then 2016.

You people might get tired of it, but you aren't the audience Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars aim at.&&That year price is literally 2-3 family theater nights in price, if you were to have bought snacks and popcorn in-house on those two nights. Moviepass is MVP.&&I think I'm going to replace all my reaction gifs with Titus gifs.&&In all fairness, they haven't even started promoting that film yet. Once the Ep VIII hype dies down (likely post theatrical run), I'm sure they'll put out some posters and trailers which should kickstart the Solo hype. I don't expect the Solo hype to become as big as the Ep VIII hype, but it'll certainly be much bigger than it currently is come release day next May.&&We’re going to cum money

-Disney probably &&Negasonic Teenage Warhead is definitely going to be my favorite new Disney princess.&&It's not already?&&I remember hearing Tarantino talking about how they gave him a hard time for trying to get his movie shown at a specific theater because it landed on a Star Wars movie date. I see a lot more of this coming in the future. &&I don't even mind this approach. If you can make your continuity stack effectively and keep it building like Marvel does, great! But TBH, I'm perfectly happy with just making a good film by cherry picking what continuity you do and don't want, too. I think both Deadpool and Logan take full advantage of the opportunities presented by this approach and I'd be a-ok with whoever wanted to employ it be they Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Transformers or you name it. Keep what works, toss what doesn't, and make a movie I want to see a second time. Do that and I'll make my peace with continuity and shared universeness or lack thereof.&&Aside from X-Men 3, what else was retconned?&&Just seemed strange since DoFP effectively cleaned up all the loose ends and shitty decisions and gave them a clean slate to work with&&From everything I've read about it, Demon Bear is a part of the story but not the main plot. They have tried to down play it because everyone was freaking out that they were doing what looked like the Demon Bear saga. It would be cool if this sets up a full on Demon Bear movie, which might make sense to establish the characters first...but if they want to make a real New Mutants horror then it has to be Demon Bear.

It seems like they are just going to go with the teens not being able to control their powers as they discover them while Danielle Moonstar messes shit up.&&[deleted]&&[I pray you do.](https://i.imgur.com/KoDE3UM.gifv)&&",2018-01-11 16:15:52

Crazy folk. &&It can be original with still saying the most famous phrase in the movie so people can get excited for it marketing wise.  He obviously isn’t like the original Dundee based off those knife slashing moves he’s got.  I’m not saying it’ll be good, but with like 11 words he said in that teaser, pretty refoculous to just say it’s gunna be one big rehash.  Even the new super troopers trailer was 98% new material, but they still had to throw in a couple classics from the original.  Some people need that shit to go see it, I’m not one of them, but I’m not gunna judge a movie off of one line.  Now if the full trailer comes out and it’s not but digging up old lines and scenarios, then by all means criticize it.&&He's one of the few actors who I give a pass for playing the same dude in everything he does.  &&Amusingly, a writer for Sydney Morning Herald (popular Australian news service) used the idea of an imaginary sequel - *Crocodile Dundee 4* - as an example of fake movies that might happen in the current Australian movie market.

Paul Hogan was looking for a way to bring this franchise back for a new generation.

Edit: link https://youtu.be/4kaG95ZIjHQ

There was also an initial commercial that REALLY made it look like there were making a sequel, but I couldn't find that. &&I assume so, Paul Hogan is a colossal twat who insists on writing credits when he doesn't deserve them. The third Crocodile Dundee movie (where he's in Los Angeles) had two writers and then Paul Hogan came in and just changed little things and wanted SOLE writing credit. They talk about it on the How Did This Get Made podcast I think (some podcast about bad movies).

But Hogan made massive money on Crocodile Dundee because he literally owned it and just got investors to float for filming and production and to get it in theaters in the 80s. Then he dropped his old wife and married Linda Kozlowski, his co-star in the film. Then he got into trouble for tax dodging Australia's tax authority.

But I just don't imagine he could take the piss out of his heroic Croc Dundee character in this manner unless he is super desperate for money, because Danny McBride will shit all over him in the movie. And Danny McBride doesn't really need this role, I'm sure he has lots of things lined up.

My money is also on this being a joke.

That story was obviously very imbelished but she came all the way out there to write about it so she follows him into the bush for a few days. He saves her life, she swoons, decides it'd make for a good end to his story to take him to a big city, somewhere he's never been before. So they go back to New York where Mic finds out she's engaged to some asswipe, gets salty, *that's* a knoife, thinks all black dudes are tribesmen, decides ""fuck this I'm out"", and heads to the subway to...I dunno, go to Australia via subway train I guess?

They stopped a couple times for directions before it happened and one of the police officers that helped even stated that he wasn't speeding and was driving normally. Most likely he was just distracted and went to the right side of the road because he was American and not used to being on the left. Terrible that people died but you don't normally throw people in jail for an accident like this if they were went doing anything egregious. I assume there was some type of financial settlement with the family. &&The wiki doesn't mention anything about being under the influence. Was it just a legitimate accident, even if he was at fault?&&I'd give 80% odds on this being real. Article says Paul Hogan has made a statement, He will appear in the movie.

Stallworth, who is black (which I feel is important when talking about the US justice system), only got 30 days in jail as punishment and served only 24 days. 

Also, he presumably paid a large settlement amount to avoid a civil suit, though I don’t think the family had any evidence against him anyway, so the DA still could have prosecuted him as “pressing charges” isn’t really a thing. DA likely saw that the family was as whole as could be made. 

**TLDR — NFL player with 0.12 BAC runs over pedestrian while going 50 in a 40mph zone, gets 30 days in jail, serves 24. Still not sure how he didn’t get punished more.**&&It was an accident. He even stopped for directions from a cop a few minutes prior. And hee himself had no memory of the whole day die to the head injury sustained and had to plead no contest.

You just lost your self 175 dollars. &&How much is it if I do get to choose the people?&&There were some mitigating factors in the Donté Stallworth case. The accident occurred on an extremely busy road that is more like a highway, while the speed limit is technically 40 it is routinely exceeded by much more than 10mph. Trying to cross the maccauther causeway on foot is not something I would consider a good idea. 

His BAC was over the limit but it wasn’t over it by a lot. There’s a chance that the accident might not have been avoidable, even if he had been completely sober. 

I assume the DA thought he was unlikely to get a conviction for a more serious charge or a more severe sentence based on those factors and decided a plea deal would be best. A plea has the added benefit of basically making a civil suit a slam dunk, so it could have been more beneficial to the family to have the plea then to have Stallworth acquitted because the DA overplayed his hand. &&Jumbuck = Sheep

Silly question maybe: how did you manage to find so many locations in just one weekend? Did you know where to go? Or is it something that is relatively well known by people living in Atlanta?

I'm not even sure how you found most of those locations, but it's very neat to see the random things they changed for the shows and movies.

Suggestion: break all the images into separate albums per movie. A 240 image album is the Imgur equivalent to a wall of text with no paragraphs. Makes hard to consume and hard to navigate inline with RES.

It would also be cool to caption the photos so that they can each stand alone. For example: 

* Avengers headquarters from Captain America: Civil War
* Avengers headquarters from Captain America: Civil War [The Porsche Experience]&&I find it interesting how many movies just left the stores in the background that are normally there, and how some movies painstakingly spent hundreds of hours replacing everything with generic stuff, like that picture of ""Delmar's Deli-Grocer"" in the Spider-Man pictures. They even replaced the street signs saying 'Don't block the box'.&&I thought the exterior of the house in Spider-Man was fake. It was too perfect or something. Too cool.

Where is it? Ansley Park? I want to live there now... Though it does look a little sad in the winter.

Edit: I found it! It's Ansley Park alright. Sadly, it doesn't look like the owners will be selling it anytime soon. So I can't purchase it with all those millions of dollars I have lying around.&&So the name of the store in my cousin vinny was actually changed to the sac o’ suds. Pretty cool &&This is awesome, OP.

For anyone that lives in Atlanta or anywhere in Georgia, have you ever seen a movie or TV show being filmed? Or maybe had your itinerary to work changed because some part of the city was closed for the day for a shooting?&&this is amazing, going to check it out when i am back in Atlanta
good job OP&&How in the heckarooney did you know where all this stuff was?&&Wow, this is amazing. I keep looking for all the differences between real and the movie pics. It's fascinating how they dress up the scene. I noticed in a lot of shots they randomly put people standing around. Really cool stuff, thanks OP.&&You should’ve hit up “The Blue Cat” off of Bells Ferry from Ozark while you were up towards Cartersville.&&Huh. Some of guardians 2 was filmed in my home town. Neat.&&At first I was like, 240 pics, there’s no way I am going through all of them. 

*Proceeds to go through all of them. *

Nice job!!&&When you get to the 60s that's the city of Monticello. My Cousin Vinny and Trisha Yearwood are about the only thing that town is known for. I haven't been back in about 10 years but it doesn't look like it's changed any.&&This is super cool. Nice job!&&There are some scenes from Furious 7 filmed in Atlanta. The Tupac movie ""All eyes on me"" was filmed about 100yds from the Stranger Things arcade. It's an old jail that's being used for storage.&&That Good fellas (pictures 38 and 39) is super close to my old GA tech apartment.  Thanks for sharing all these!&&I wish someone would do this in Memphis, I wouldn't know where to start or have the time.&&Shout out to the Mellow Mushroom in Guardians of the Galaxy 2! Great company to work for.&&Awesome work man. I had no idea some of these locations we're places I've driven by dozens of times. &&Oh shit. I didn't realize the van scene in Spiderman was Piedmont Park. This is awesome.&&It's pretty cool seeing how real the digital altering of these locations look compared to the original.&&My dad is a huge My Cousin Vinny fan. When we are in Atlata next year I will have to take him there. &&Wow! 5 seconds later: Load 230 images. Wow! And, good-bye, Sunday. &&Really really good job! Wow&&I still get a boner when I see Marisa Tomei in that movie. &&Thank you. I learned a lot from this.&&What building on Emory’s campus is that research building from Stranger Things? I spent four years of my life there and don’t recall seeing that building one time. &&Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a post like this before. As an amateur filmmaker, I’m learning a lot about production/set design just by looking at these. Thank you for sharing!&&Born and Raised Atlantan here. I love seeing my hometown in all these photos and movies. 

I actually got married in the garden that was a filming location for the first Stranger Things. The scene where Hopper has the flashback of his daughter is Cator Woolford Gardens on Ponce. Beautiful place if you have never been and is also a nonprofit helping children and adults with Autism. &&You should do Wilmington next!&&I actually did kind of the same this past summer! I only went to the Infinity War set (basically the entire set besides where they were filming at the current time was open to the public) and a picture of a overhang I took was the exact overhang from the movie. [Pretty cool!](https://imgur.com/a/RnGxv) &&This is really cool! Living in ATL, I love to see where the movies were shot. While watching Baby Driver, I kept annoying my family by telling them I knew where such and such was shot, etc but I was so excited to see the places. Lol. &&yes, I love all the Stranger Things ones&&You just made my day!  &&hly cow.

it really goes to show nothing we see in the movies really is actually real&&You must be the local tour guide. If not, you need to be. &&Dies that say butts county in 208?&&This was amaz-balls. Thanks, OP. Forever I love Atlanta. &&Fantastic work! Thanks a lot for this nostalgic journey.&&Very cool. I live in Atlanta. I love it when they make movies here.&&I live half a mile away from downtown Covington and right next to the cemetery. Very cool to see your hometown on trending.&&thanks! feel free to check out my Instagram @hollywood_irl for more&&Interesting as Atlanta needs a new OC&&Don't feel stupid. They edit out the little details that might make it easy for a location to pop up for you as recognisable. You'd also see it from an angle you'd be unlikely to see in real life. Finally, the color-adjustments also wreak havoc.

If I were to take a picture of my house and saturate it in the way movies improve their shots, I wouldn't recognise the place either. It makes the difference between 'old concrete' and 'scifi-ish concrete', or 'plant life' and 'a colorful garden'.&&don't, most garages look the same, hard to tell if you're not looking for it. had someone say the same thing about the one in dark knight, he was there everyday for months and never realized it until he saw my pics.

makes me wonder how much around me has been used that I'm missing (probably not much really, I live in the middle of nowhere)&&I was working in the Biltmore when they filmed that scene! I remember because they wouldn't let us park above the sixth floor, plus film trucks clogged all the exits except for one.&&The color correction is huge. There is a building that has been used in countless productions. Future, retro, etc.  change color, add smoke, etc., and poof! transformation.&&Is it the AT&T deck in midtown? I park there and it looked like it to me. &&Civil war was partially filmed at my college. Of course I missed it when everyone got see the actors on campus. &&there's a surprisingly large amount of us. some are less respectful than others unfortunately and have no problems trespassing

the people that own walter whites house (breaking bad) actually had to put up a fence because people kept coming by and throwing pizzas on the roof&&Walking Dead gets a LOT of people checking it out. It's like 30 minutes south of Atlanta I believe, in a town called Senoia (I believe that's how its spelled). They do a whole lot of their filming in that area, and a lot of people check it out. It was especially active during S5 and S6 when the show was just obliterating everything else on TV. 

Ratings have fallen, but I'm sure people are still going. Surprised there isn't a full time shop there more than that museum place. 

Atlanta is quickly becoming one of the biggest filming spots in the country easily. They put it a big tax break and the area is great for filming. I don't expect it to stop anytime soon either.

Atlanta in general is a lot different than it was in the 90s. Made a ton of progress. Good for them.&&Rick's original house in Atlanta (The Walking Dead) where he lives/awakes is the same thing. Photos only and please be respectful signs. &&there were so many fans of Breaking Bad that kept going to Walter White's house in Albuquerque that the home owners put up a fence to keep people out. 



&&For year, the owners of the Goonies house in Astoria, OR allowed tourists to walk up their long driveway and take pictures so long as they parked at the end and didn't make too much of a mess or disturbance.  Unfortunately, a couple of years ago, assholes finally ruined it for the rest of us, and a sign went up saying not to walk up the drive way or take pictures.  I'm glad I made my pilgrimage before that - it's sad that some people can't be respectful. &&amityville house is the same way. they even changed the house number and windows to deter people from visiting it&&they big dish is actually still there, but it's black and hidden in shadows. not sure if they painted it white for the show (or recolored it while adding in the van). 

never even noticed the small dishes on the roof!&&That building was already vacant IIRC (per the Beyond Stranger Things aftershow) so it had just been an abandoned shithole prior to ST. Maybe it was an arcade back in the 80s but they all died out long ago. &&The thing I noticed about the Stranger Things pics was the only ""real"" one that says Hawkins Middle School was a place where it doesn't say it in the show&&Caption says it used to be a laundromat?&&Last night I went to bar that had half the space devoted to arcade and pinball games from the late 70s through early 90s. It's one of at least three ""barcades"" in my city that do the same thing.  

A different model, for sure.  But the games can still be played.    &&Looking thru the stranger things pics I noticed the red light posts. Weren't they just on wires over the street in the 80s?&&Really want someone to do this for Vancouver now&&A little bit?  Productions that have used my neighborhood:

Taken 3

The Hunger Games

Fast and the Furious (7?)

Baby Driver

The Internship

Almost Christmas

Selma

Halt and Catch Fire

Kevin (Probably) Saves the World

Etc.  When I first moved here it was pretty cool, but it becomes obnoxious soon enough.  Road closures, loud noises, etc.  Baby Driver did live-fire explosions and shooting from midnight until 7 AM, the babies and dogs in the neighborhood were NOT happy.&&Has been, since the early 2010s. Now #1 in film production in the world (ahead of NY & L.A.).&&that's my next trip, hopefully. split between Vancouver and seattle/snoqualmie&&Atlanta did a hell of a job building a television and movie industry from nothing.&&Yes. Archer is also made in Atlanta. Everyone's coming for the tax breaks. &&Nah it never never play itself&&Obligatory [Vancouver never plays itself](https://youtu.be/ojm74VGsZBU).&&pretty sure it was at one point, but now it's a shady beauty salon/assumed drug den&&There used to be a Midwest regional burger chain in the 70s called Red Barn.  The chain went out of business, but scattered around small towns in Ohio and Indiana you can still see small barn-shaped buildings with new businesses in them - carpet stores, furniture showrooms, what have you.&&It's weird that it's a hair salon....i think&&I thought that was perfect because crappy little Dairy Queens are a Southern small town staple.&&haha, yeah, I can get a bit carried away. you should see my hawaii album I visited just about every single LOST location, plus some movies, I think it's like 350 or so.

I have an Instagram (@hollywood_irl) where I put both shots into one pic, already have nearly 200 posted and have just over 300 on standby. &&I had no idea, thats cool! part of me wants to couple these projects with interviews with people that went to these places or let their houses be used to see what the experience was like. &&I was so disappointed the civic center was all closed up. there was a few more shots I wanted to recreate, but the west gate was locked and the east parking lot is blocked off for construction.

same with baby driver, the parking garage under the safe house is the gold deck by the Georgia Dome which is closed, as is the parking lot to the second bank they robbed.

it was really cool though to see the other baby driver stuff and kinda follow where they went in the film. I attempted to recreate his walk to the coffee shop, but my video skills are not that great&&https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LMdfj62iC_g#

This scene is shot in the University Center at Clayton State where I go to school.  And I met RDJ, Don Cheadle and Mark Ruffalo 4 hours ago as they dined at my restaurant and I got to run food to their table. I had to compose myself. &&Being a GSU student, some things rest took me out of the immersion of baby driver. For example, the very first bank heist in the movie and their little hideout is like... A five minute walk. I got to see Edgar Wright and Jaimie Foxx too! &&Spoiler alert?! Thanks..&&they shot some of it in NYC. his school, the ferry, and a few random street scenes. I was shocked how much of it was filmed in atlanta though. apparently most marvel films are headed down to Atlanta area. may have to head back up and stalk the cast when they start shooting infinity war 2 😉&&Yup. Being an Atlanta native, seeing parts of Atlanta I'm familier with - like Grady HS im SM:HC - really can be distracting when they are trying to pass it off as another city. 

I guess Atlanta is the new Vancouver. &&Most movies set in NYC aren't, a lot film elsewhere and it gets really noticeable when you go from a spot shot of Midtown to someplace that looks like East NY.  


The funny ones feature a decided working lack of geography.  So wait...you ran that on foot?  Plus Westchester is a notoriously weird ass county you from Yonkers, aka mini NY, to full on suburbs where people own an acre.&&Funny you say that - I worked on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 & 2. Both were primarily shot in L.A., with a few exteriors (and really, I mean a *few*) shot in NYC.&&It's impressive how they can fairly convincingly ""New Yorkify"" a street called Peachtree.&&thanks!

I went to Chicago this summer as well (and again in november). I don't recall if I posted my Chicago album in here (you can find it on my imgur or browse through the handful I've posted on Instagram so far @hollywood_irl), I think I went to every dark knight location I could legally get access too. Chicago is a great city for movie locations&&Accidentally finding them is the best, I was in San Francisco last year and just walking down the street, suddenly realise this diner looks super familiar so I googled it, turns it out its in 'So I Married An Axe Murderer'.&&I've always wondered what it's like to be  US of American and find these real world places in films... Like, does it take away the escapist Hollywood ""another world"" movie experience that us others get...&&i never noticed it either until I was researching this project. worst part is this one was quite out of the way, but figured we'd make the trip so we could get mellow mushroom for lunch (it's out favorite as well), only to find out they are temporarily closed. 45 minutes of driving just to get one picture (well, 2, the accountant bridge was only 5 minutes away)&&Lmao I thought the same thing I love Mellow Mushroom&&We had one open up and it sadly didnt last due to expensive leasing on the building. miss their unique take on pizza &&Man, I love me some Mellow. Always a good time. &&When does this scene happen in GotG2?&&Bruh check Felinis out if you live in atlanta.&&The one thing I didnt expect to be the same were the rotten pumpkins!&&aside from the interior to bennys burgers and a few store signs I felt they looked pretty much the same. what changes did you notice?&&I wanted to just because I hear it's a nice town, but I'm one of the few who actually don't care about that show at all and I already had so much to see for movies/shows I loved&&thanks so much, I put in a lot of effort to match shots, so that really means a lot.

I follow a bunch of other filming location people on Instagram and it kinda bugs me when hey don't put in that effort. yeah, it's the same place but you're missing half the building and it's from a different angle. hell, even some of my old work is like that when I was still learning and I hate looking at it. I've definitely improved over the years.

as for lenses, sometimes. it can be a real bitch because focal length can change so much. I do have a nice lens that goes 18mm to 150mm so I don't need to change the lens too much, but I do need to change the focal length a lot. 

the biggest challenge with matching angles is just physical limitations. had a lot of issues in Chicago because Chris Nolan uses so many aerial/crane shots that I couldn't get (may need to invest in a drone soon), and they also have the ability to close down streets/have permission to walk on properties. I had a bitch of a time getting the joker/Batman fight in Chicago cuz I had to dodge traffic to get shots from literally the middle of the road. then you have stuff like steves house in stranger things, show was filmed from halfway down the yard in a cluster of trees, so you have a great view of the house, while I had to take it from the road so the trees block some of the view.

as for the house, you're the second person to ask that. as far as I know pineapple express was filmed in LA area only, but I guess I'll need to double check&&thanks!&&Probably a combination of local movie buffs that recognise locations and movie people / location scouts telling fans when they get asked.

Some places are so iconic they get used in multiple movies, and I am quite sure that location scouts will have a proverbial flip book with visually interesting locations they've come across so that they can look through it whenever they need to find something that matches a particular vision a director has.&&Is there a sub for film locations like this?&&a lot of it comes from when they are filming. they need to out the info out there because roads will be closed and whatnot. couple that with people that live in the area and know what stuff is, word spreads. there's also little details to catch sometime like a partial street sign or landmark. 

then some times if you're lucky the movie doesn't cheat and you can find things based on other locations (example: I was able to find Terrance Howard's house and Hugh Jackmans house from prisoners, but not the house with the RV, so I just followed the supposed route from the film, and sure enough the rv house was right where it should have been)&&[deleted]&&parts of it were filmed in NYC.

Georgia offers some great tax breaks that other larger states/cities don't offer so a lot of production is moving down south. &&for sure! it's amazing what they can do. my favorite story about this is hawaii. the entire show of LOST was filmed in Oahu. that's impressive in itself for all the different places in the show, but there's one greet in particular, that was used as like 5 different states and 3 different countries. it's absolutely astounding to see the effort they put in.

or even just the editing. in GotG2 the DQ at the beginning, and the blue blob that takes over the town toward the end (by the mellow mushroom) are supposed to be the same tiny town in the movie, but in reality they are about an hour apart. stuff like that always blows my mind&&thanks!! I have spreadhseets to if you want those for actual addresses&&That was my primary takeaway.  My question is, was it written into the movie knowing the building already existed, did they scout the location and add it to the script, or my favorite, did they change the name of an existing restaurant to Sac O Suds thanks to the notoriety brought by being the setting from the movie?&&it's a real one off shop. not a chain as far as I know. guess they just used it and didn't change the name. &&I was surprised for sure. I think it's a pride thing cuz looking at some screen caps it's not the same as in the show (in real life the law is a bit bigger and the letters are lower)

so not sure if they did it themselves or if production redid it for season 2 and the school just kept it. either way it was cool to see a bit of the show leaking I to the real world&&depends on the shot. im guessing the arcade was a physical sign, we see it a few times and each time the camera is panning. probably cheaper to make a cheap sign then CGI it.

some other stuff like the Avengers logo was probably digital.

all the graffiti in baby driver was probably a mixture. I know they out up some fake walls with real graffiti, and probably also had some fake graffiti on real walls&&Digitally. Way easier, cheaper and faster. It's incredible the amount of things they retouch... saw the Baby Driver title building? They added extra stories!&&For the Mellow Mushroom scene, all of the surrounding building marquee's were re-skinned. I was actually eating at MM that weekend when they were doing the work.&&It genuinely depends on what the location will allow. Digital is almost always more expensive, but sometimes the only way. A lot of times through it's just set dressers changing out the signage. &&there are websites dedicated to this style of stuff. I do a lot of research and make spreadsheets and maps for the best routes to take. 

I don't live in atlanta, in fact this was my first time there, so yeah, just a lot of pre-planning&&Ah I see you've been to Atlanta! If you get lost, just take a right on Peachtree. Take that until you run into Peachtree.&&yep. it was part of a tour/experience the farm put on. each location had a puzzle to solve with an employee/actor giving clues dressed up as someone from the show.&&it's just cuz it's winter now&&I debate that all the time. part of me loves seeing how they really look without the Hollywood glitz, but part of me also gets really excited when it's the same (my fiancee and I both got way too excited that the stranger things school still said Hawkins middle school)&&😂😂😂&&wish then place didn't look so sketchy. you barely see it from the outside, so I wanted to get some interior shots, but it didn't look like the best place&&haha, I'd love to one day, but that's a bit out of the way. if/when I start doing other countries I need to start with England, and the new Zealand. &&for sure. and those are some of my favorite shots. sure it's fun when they match up and look 100% identical, but I almost prefer when you can tell it's the same, but they added something go make it look totally different. 

one of my favorite shots I got was a Chicago skyline from transformers 3. it's a skyline and all the buildings match perfectly, but in transformed they were all damaged and half blown up, while in real life they are fine. &&must've blown up over night. sitting at 12.5k when I woke up and I got like 400 new followers on Instagram. RIP inbox, as they say&&I wish I had more from Avengers. most marvel stuff was filmed in atlanta, but at pinewood studios.

the other stuff is either gone (pym labs was demolished earlier last year), off limits (church from civil war [funeral scene] said I could visit but not take pics), or too scary (I missed some homecoming pics because I was in a bad part of town with $3000 worth of camera equipment and I just wanted to get out of there)&&thanks for looking!

seasons changing is the bane of my existence some times. first, it was supposed to snow that weekend, so almost had to cancel my top since snow changes the look of a scene so much it would run  my photos, but also leaves and sun do as well. it was a toss up of when to go because baby driver is all summer, bright sun, full leaves, etc, while prisoners and stranger things was more fall/winter. either way something wasn't gonna match.

decided on winter because there's trees in front of the stranger things lab that would've blocked the building had I gone in summer. I was shocked how many of some trees were still full though&&well obviously I'm a huge movie nerd, so there's that. but I'm also into photography, so this seemed like the next step I guess, combining my 2 passions. 

it started a little back in 2001, went back up to NY to visit family and figured while in the area I would take a quick trip to red bank NJ to see the Kevin Smith stuff. wasn't nearly as serious or OCD back then, so it was just ugly snap shots on a disposable camera.

when it really kicked in was in 2014 I went to hawaii for a LOST fan event. the entire show was shot on the island and I am crazy about the show, borderline obsessed (minus the borderline), and I made it my mission to see everything. 

since then I've developed my process, first time out I was just shooting from memory, but now I build spreadsheets and maps, plan out routes, save screenshots to know the angles I want to recreate, and even Mark them with guide lines now so I can remember what to look for when I'm there. often times I have so much on my schedule I'm only spending minutes at a location and still get so excited to see places from my favorite films that I don't have the time or focus to study a pic to get it right (and my OCD yells at me later) so I've started marking pics to know exactly what to look for&&this is a surpsingly common hobby and there are tons of websites dedicated to location addresses. 

some I was able to find just based on what we see (mellow mushroom or healey building  for example, clear things that are easy to just Google), or sometimes you get lucky and you can see street signs in the shot still 

thank for looking!&&wills house was the one I didn't get to see. apparently the owners are very strict about their privacy and requested their address not be made public&&really?? get on it, baby driver and prisoners especially. they are fantastic&&tough to say. I had been planning the trip for about a month to a month and a half,  it i was also only really working on it the first hour or 2 of work a few days a week&&stone mountain, 5039 Memorial Dr to be exact&&it was weird. it seems like a decent upper middle class area, but both times I went to take pics of Hugh Jackmans house (I messed up my first pic) there was some shady looking people across the street. second time one even confronted me cuz he thought I was messing with his truck. I had to explain my weird hobby and then kinda just ran away&&yep!&&man, I REALLY wanted to, it's such an underrated film, but as a tiny shy white guy with a ton of expensive camera equipment, I didn't feel safe visiting most locations I was able to find&&it's crazy how much post production movies do. I've noticed this a lot for my LOST stuff in Hawaii, even in bright sunny days like in the show, my colors and tone don't match up to their end product.

I could easily apply the same filters and changes, but I like shooting them how they look in real-life, no glitz, no glam. (well some glitz and glam, I do need to edit them a bit 😅)&&I was shocked how similar it still was after all these years. only changes I could see, aside from trees growing, is they repainted some stuff. 

I think the town is so old that it's a protected landmark now? the really surprising thing was how busy it was. so many cars got in my way and I couldn't get as many shots from the road since I had to avoid traffic&&thanks. it's a lot of work, but fun, trying to figure out the puzzle of where to stand and what lens to use, glad it's appreciated &&confession, I haven't seen that since I was a kid. haven't even thought about it. but it was in a Conyers filming brochure with a screenshot to match. 

gonna have to rewatch it soon&&yeahhhhhh, about that. they added the awning and some other things that make it look different. 

also they filmed from the middle of the intersection causing the angles to be different than mine since I had to shoot from across the entire road.

also, they had cleared the streets and had security teams and didn't have to worry about get to mugged or killed. it was a scary area and I didn't spend the time lining up my shots correctly. there was a few more angles I wanted to get, but my fiancee and I were not comfortable being there so I failed on these ones. kinda regret that.&&some it was. not a fan of the movies at all, was gonna see President Snows house, but the hours they were open the day we were near didn't line up with my scheduls&&they did. which sucks since I originally used those trees as guide lines to match the angle. was surprised to get there and see an empty lawn.

also, this is the back yard technically. did not expect that.&&mostly through Google. there's a ton of sites That has this Info. also some detective work, looking for partial street signs or company names in the movie, or even just looking around other locations on Google maps

it took about a month and a half, but that was just planning during the first hour or two to work a few days a week&&it matched really good actually and all they did was add an awning, I just fucked up the shot. 

it's a bad area and I didn't feel comfortable there so I didn't take proper time to line it all up. there was 2 more shots I wanted to get at that intersection that I ended up bailing on just because I didn't feel safe&&most people don't. I posted my Chicago album here mid 2017 and I got that response a lot. even from huge dark knight fans ""I've seen the movie 50 times and I live in Chicago, how did I never realize??""&&had I known itbwas out there I would have. for some reason marvel locations are really tough to find. &&Favorable tax breaks for the film industry in GA. &&tax breaks. 

also most major cities get used a lot. I seem to see Chicago in more movies than any other city, aside from LA of course&&5116 GA‐85, Forest Park, GA 30297

in case you need the address&&it's a start!!
&&dude!!!! that would've been cool to get a pic of.

I didn't  see any others except for in Covington they had one in front of the 12 oaks B&B for in the heat of the night

I really wanted to tour the Porsche place and get some other angles, but you all were closed that weekend&&I'm one of the few people that doesn't like that show at all, so I didn't waste time on that although I know there's a ton of cool iconic spots to photograph

and yes, the school still says Hawkins&&that was all interior shots and since we were going on a holiday weekend I assumed I wouldn't have any access to that. it was on the list though&&thanks for the ideas. I did plan on doing that, but I also worried if I posted only only movie the others would get lost/people would miss links.

as for labeling, yeah, probably should, and may go back and re-edit, biggest issue there is i just wouldnt know what to label some stuff since some of it is just like baby running. I run into the same issue on my Instagram, I started using a quote from each scene, but I've been running into a lot lately where there's no dialogue

I think I may just build a website since imgur is a piece of shit when it comes to organization. spent like 2 hours moving photos around since you can no longer sort  by file name&&No. Then again, I live outside of Atlanta. I was surprised to see how many movies were filmed in GA.&&I don't live anywhere near Atlanta, but I did get quite a few replies of people that said they live nearby where they filmed stuff.

my ex wife, her corporate office was in Pittsburgh and they shot dark knight rises right outside their  building her coworkers kept sending pics all day. I was so jealous&&I wanted to, loved Ozark, but the schedule was tight and I honestly didn't even think we'd make it to Cartersville. next time!&&it was tough to find any addresses for F&F. I found an address for the toretto/shaw fight but I think something was off because there was no way to get the background building to line up. also had Hahns funeral on my list, but we ran out of time&&it's actually about 30 minutes south east, town called Monticello. I can give you address is need be&&Only that movie? She’s still hot. 

Then again I’m almost 50. &&not sure, I wanna say biology since I saw a few signs in the parking lot

1256 Briarcliff Rd NE

there's the address if you wanna dig further  I don't live in the area so I ha e no clue what it is&&I actually posted an LA album and Chicago album in this sub a while back. also did a Hawaii one but someone downboted it to zero and it never got any attention after that.

I have more albums on my imgur and I have an Instagram too (@hollywood_irl)&&You did this all in a weekend?&&I actually had a nice chat with a Porsche HR rep  in a brewery a year or so ago. He mentioned that his main office was a filming location for Avengers but I never bothered to look it up.  Thanks for doing the work for me. &&I actually had a nice chat with a Porsche HR rep  in a brewery a year or so ago.

Awesome stuff. &&Omg, I'm actually in the pic in spiderman where he's leaving the deli. (as an extra) I always wanted a screen cap of it, thanks!! &&Don't call it that.&&Or ""Atlanta"" and ""Generic African City""&&That’s something I wanna do with my photography. I obviously have to take pictures in familiar spots however I don’t want those spots to appear recognizable because then it’ll take me out of the photo &&I think it's the office next to Lindbergh station. I used to work there. &&I used to live next door to a location from Jupiter Ascending. Terrible movie, no fanbase, people still came. Quite a few of them were horribly rude. The owner ended up donating the house to the local fire department, which ended up burning it down. &&Won't lie I laughed when I read that. Those poor people, that would of sucked so badly. 

Thanks for the pictures, very cool. &&Now I want to send them pizza to make up for any messes they've had to deal with.

""Shit didn't see that outcome""&&How do you go about finding the locations, and such specific moments/shots? Seems like a lot to keep track of.&&They could've made a business out of it. 

Pay 5$, have your picture taken throwing a fake pizza on the roof, 3 of those 5$ go to the local food bank.&&I thought they had to put up the fence because Walter White lived there&&Yep. Senoia is the place. 

In the early 90's, Georgia was #3 in film production behind L.A. & New York. At the time, Senoia's Riverwood Studios was the location for a number of films, including Fried Green Tomatoes (which was set in downtown Senoia. The ""Whistle-Stop Cafe"" did become a museum-style place for visitors - see photos).

Then things fell off as unions moved in - it became more expensive to shoot on location in GA than in Vancouver (which took over the #3 spot) along with Wilmington, NC (see: Dawson's Creek + most Kevin Williamson & late 90's teen movies).

Early 2000s, GA added the tax break - then re-upped it in the early 2010s when NC allowed theirs to expire. And now they're not ""becoming"" one of the biggest filming locations in the country - [Georgia is now #1 for feature film production](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/05/24/georgia-no-1-in-feature-film-productions.html).

*Source: Used to work for the Georgia Film Office in the late 90's.*&&Senoia is right. They've even got a little museum there dedicated to TWD with some props on site. Norman Reedus opened a restaurant there in 2017. There's parts of the town literally boarded up to protect when they're filming. It was a little surreal.&&That's strange considering how incredibly minor a role that plays in the show- a fraction of the pilot episode. At least Walter White's house or the Stranger Things houses have more presence (not that justifies assholes).&&It was due to people throwing pizzas on the roof.

I was there ~1.5 years ago and did a drive by look with a photo, no fence. My bf said when he visited a year prior they actually were really nice because he and his friend were respectful, just took some photos from the curb and said hello. I think a lot has died down since the show is done, but it was a nightmare for them for a while.&&>there were so many fans of Breaking Bad that kept going to Walter White's house in Albuquerque that the home owners put up a fence to keep people out. 


You're the guy that tells people stuff but then leaves out the interesting part&&It's worse than it's been in decades. National parks are getting way more weird vandalism and shit behavior.

In the 50s-60s people were careless and didn't even think about it. Then it got better and now worse again.

&&Which sort of sucks...

It wasn’t a prop house from a movie... it was the REAL house and those windows were iconic.

It’s not like the house has been owned by one family all these years.  It’s been bought and sold multiple times.

You’d think at this point, you wouldn’t be buying the house unless you were into the internationally famous lore surrounding it.&&Sewer from It miniseries is in New West.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZUNowVnC3a/&&Do they give residents anything for the inconveniences?&&what is the reason for this?&&As someone from Seattle, I'm sad that not much is filmed here anymore. It's like we went through our child star cute phase in the 80s and 90's and now no one wants to see us. &&ah yes. all those sweet sweet Twin Peaks locations.&&I wonder where they go to shoot the jungle scenes&&It was still a Dairy Queen when I was in high school - so at least until about 5 years ago. &&Can confirm, very old school DQ shape. Source-spent a good bit of time at local DQs while growing up. &&Just like Pizza Hut too, a lot of existing ones have remodeled, but many in small towns have closed and become other places but there's no mistaking their past.&&I think legally it's a hair salon, but they definitely do some other business out of that building...&&Oh shit. Know what I’m looking at tomorrow!&&Awesome i'll check it out
&&They also took ""volunteer"" students, like me. I was home schooled and went my senior year for certified diploma. I was part of the first graduating class there. 
It was Stockbridge High before that, my mom graduated from there.


Really great job with the pics! &&That sounds like a wonderful idea. You should post an AskReddit for such people. And then go and visit them too.  &&In case you didn’t know, I’m pretty positive (aka heard from many residents) that place is where they used to shoot Family Feud. 

And yeah, that place was PACKED when they shot there. Seeing the final product was awesome because I couldn’t imagine what they could’ve been shooting in such a boring location. I walked by it every day and they had some pretty behemoth green screens. 

Regardless, man, this is an incredible job. There are shots in here you recreated that 99% of people couldn’t locate. Really neat to see the real life comparisons. I miss living in ATL for all of these things! &&Dang. While watching Civil War I couldn't place that location that turns out to be the Civic Center. Now I'm disappointed. I've been to the Civic Center. I saw River Dance there ages ago. &&The dozen Chris Evans accounts I follow all posted a selfie someone took with him at the Atlanta airport yesterday. Apparently he was going back to Boston. Must be so neat to live in Atlanta :D! &&That’s how I felt in guardians of the galaxy. That mellow mushroom is super recognizable, I know the person who painted the mural on it, and I was instantly thinking “hey look it’s Cartersville, I miss the Italian restaurant that used to be there. I wish they’d put Quiznos back too”.&&Marvel seems to shoot most of their stuff down there (because of the tax breaks) so I get it. But NYC is such a part of the Spider-Man lore that I was a little bit disappointed.&&Hate to be the one to tell you this, but they started filming Avengers 4 months ago. They're just now wrapping up for certain characters.&&A buddy of mine is a ~~gaffer~~ Set Lightning Technician in Atlanta. According to him, they wrap on Infinity War on Friday. He’ll be there.

I’m not jealous.&&The studio is in Fayetteville. Next time you visit, check out Senoia. There has been dozens of movies and shows filmed there. They even have a list in the visitors center. If you check google earth you’ll see Alexandria, from the walking dead, is still there. &&They're almost done shooting Avengers 4 actually. &&Marvel has a studio south of the Atlanta airport. &&I live in Fayette County, GA where Pinewoods Studios is located in and film their movies. It's weird seeing our little town turn into a large hub and home of the MCU.&&They shot specific scenes on my step dad's golf course, it was really cool to watch movie magic happen so quickly. I tell him that he needs to promote his establishment as ""spidey's golf establishment of choice"", but he had yet to do so.&&Yeah and the train scene in 2 was from Chicago. They definitely had a more NYC feel than Homecoming though. &&I would love to know where original Batman locationas are (Keaton and Nicholson).&&Just followed you on Instagram. 

Really enjoying what your doing. 

Noticed you plan on Toronto next. What film locations are you hoping to locate there? &&It depends on how good a movie is and how interested you are in it. If it's really bad, it's easy to get caught up in playing yell the location. If it's something you're really into then it adds to it's appeal. 

I grew up just outside of Toronto and moved here around 2000. Scott Pilgrim vs The World takes place in Toronto during that time frame. That film was such a nostalgic trip on top of the action for me. The locations, the bars, to even the cost of transit. The phonebooth he calls his sister is besode a bar I'd frequent. The coffee shop he runs into his ex was down the street from my work that we'd use for coffee breaks. The alley fight with Todd was between my office and that coffee shop. I saw so many bands at Lee's Palace before they renovated and Edgar Wright decided to recreate that venue as it looked prior to the reno instead of using the actual bar. The graphic novels really expand on this feeling as well. &&Oh no, so sad!  Where is that Mellow Mushroom?

I went to one that was up 85 North, then you get off at I-985, and up in that part way north of Atlanta is a Mellow Mushroom that is in a gorgeous 1800's home.  It's an incredible restaurant!&&Yeah, its a really weird situation with that Mellow Mushroom. Seemingly out of nowhere it temporarily closed down and no one really understood why. 

There still a lot of confusion around why it's closed down, but the current theory is the manager just skipped town unexpectedly. 

It'll be fine though, because it's an iconic building that's already loved and won't have issues getting a nee franchisee. Until then though, it makes getting food late at night very difficult!&&Good beer and a chill atmosphere.  And they used to do Simpsons Trivia when I was in high school, so much fun!&&When Ego is spreading his ego. &&Senioa isn’t just the home to TWD. You can also visit Fayetteville where Pinewood Studios is. &&Atlantan here. I was with my dad outside the GSU law school building and we had to wait to cross the street cause they were filming Baby Driver. 

There are some parts that we can definitely recognize, but some times I didn't notice it until it was pointed out to me by OP. &&I haven't kept up with it since I don't do it anymore, but I used to sign up to be an extra in movies back when I was in college and New Orleans had its big filming boom. I assume it was for the same reason. It was a fun gig sometimes, except for filming the same scene with 200+ people from 9 PM to 6 AM. &&I think this album also does a great job of showing just how much invisible VFX work is done in some cases to make locations work for the movie. &&Yeah, it wouldn't be the first time a place had been a setting for a movie and they decided to change their name or otherwise capitalise on said movie. Kudos if they did.&&While I can't speak for all of this, I can say that's not always the case. In the part of Atlanta where I live, they've actually changed the signs and awnings out for whatever they were filming. I'm always surprised how good a job they do at getting it back to the way it was.&&i’d imagine the marquee from stranger things had to be physical because steve interacts with it but other than that they’d all be digitally added. &&But the bush disappeared on the front on that picture. Actually on all the photos there is an object or two that is impossible to remove or add. CGI was everywhere. This ridiculous amount of CGI really confuse me.&&If you going to New Zealand you may as well come to Australia as well.&&Next step is to match the focal length and aspect ratios exactly. &&Thank you.&&That one especially.

And The Wrestler. 

And Rescue Me. And Spiderman.^Yeah^all^of^them!&&long weekend, about 3.5 days&&They actually did a pretty good job showing what Lagos looks like. Lagos is a pretty nice city despite what people might think. Nigeria in general is not a bad place. It's getting better all the time too. I just recently bought a place in Lagos actually.&&Wake up in the morning- ""ohno! The next door neighbor's house burned down!""  
Neighbor:Oh yeah the fire department did it  
The fire department??????&&I don't get how people can be so disrespectful. I obviously get the drive to visit these places,even though really it's pointless, it's just a house, but it's fun and I'm always sure to be 110% respectful and courteous to home and business owners.

people really suck sometimes.&&well that's ironic.&&Yeah that would be a bit of an odd problem to have&&On the other hand, free pizza.&&it is. I have spreadhseets and folders and all sorts of stuff. locations can mostly be found online. some I'm able to find through street signs in the movies.&&[deleted]&&I think Georgia's film progress is nothing short of a huge success too. They just opened that huge megastudio there as well. I think as time goes on it will get more and more business until its the de facto filming location.

It's really perfect for filming due to having just about every kind of common scenery imaginable nearby. And it's much cheaper to live and film in than Hollywood or Vancouver. Living on the outskirts of Atlanta is dirt cheap, and you can drive into Atlanta within 15 minutes.

It's such a unique town, don't you think? It seems like be making this interesting transition from Houston-esque big city to a real international city. The airport hub really plays into that as well.

I mean when I lived there, I had Google Fiber,  Amazon 1 hour shipping, as well as about 300-400 stores within 5-10 minutes. Microcenter, Guitar Center, two of each fast food location, massive international markets (biggest koreatown outside of LA too) of every sort of ethnic group. 24 hour eating, every major grocery store, so much. And it wasn't a super expensive area either. Just all simple and easy access to everything. Lots to walk to as well.

And even ITP is amazing, especially with how Midtown has grown. Living around the belt and having access to the art theater and ponce city market (huge building with shops, an amusement park on top, and art everywhere) along with piedmont park all with easy access. There's definitely worse places to live than Atlanta.&&Fried Green Tomatoes was filmed in Juliette, not Senoia. The Whistle Stop Cafe is there too.&&The pilot episode of TWD has something special about it. Or around it. &&[deleted]&&I was there a few years ago just around the finale. I biked there since I was staying in ABQ, so I hung out there for a while to get some rest and savor it after the long ride. It was a middle of a work day and I still saw like three groups driving in and taking photos within 20 minutes. &&Nope!  Well, the properties that they use for shooting (or block their driveway, etc) get compensation they negotiate in advance, but otherwise the locals get nothing.  Productions are usually catered, so there's no real boost to local business.  Like I said, it's fun at first seeing celebrities walk around, but it becomes more of a headache as it goes on.&&A significant [tax credit](http://www.georgia.org/industries/entertainment/georgia-film-tv-production/production-incentives/), as well as a huge roster of quality local talent & crew, great facilities, an international airport that's easy to access, and the ability to find almost every type of location a production could need (from beaches to farms to cities to mountains).&&I'm actually kinda glad. Can you imagine the traffic shitshow that would ensue?&&Hey - was just coming here to post this. You grew up on the south side, too? Nice!&&Trim with a fine powder glaze special....is that what they meant all these years ago &&Considering it was in a movie, I doubt it. Fronts don't usually want that much attention&&Was it the one in Forest Park? if so that's thats the one my sister and I would walk to after school back around '74 and '75. We moved to Griffin after that in '76. &&thanks much! I put a lot of effort into researching the locations and lining up the shots correctly, it's fun but can get exhausting.

Do they provide unique content? I see fan accounts of certain people pop up in my discover feed quite often and they all post the same shit as each other.&&It's not just because of tax breaks, shooting in NYC is expensive and difficult when you need to do the kind of setups involved with a superhero movie. That's why ILM got their super-detailed CGI model of Manhattan for Avengers 1.&&How do people in Georgia feel about these kinds of tax breaks? It always seems especially hypocritical when they come from politicians who supposedly advocate letting the free market (not government) choose winners and losers.&&NYC and state cut down on their tax breaks considerably years ago, go figure. The first season of Fringe was filmed there but it became prohibitively expensive so the moved to Vancouver, North Hollywood. &&oh, i know. it was a big debate for me if i wanted to go up a few months back and try to meet some cast. ultimately I decided to wait because odds are roads/locations may have not been accessible while filming, and I'm also way too paranoid about spoilers.

I may go back at some point for more marvel and stranger things if they add new places next season, but honestly i wasn't a huge fan of the city&&I went to film school. I planned to make movies. decided it wasn't for me a d now I'm an accountant. but every time I watch behind the scenes stuff or hear about people working on movies I regret not pushing myself harder to get into the industry. &&Agreed!&&They filmed the Tim Burton one near London on a giant sound stage.

They essentially built a city in this studio lot, there was a cool feature about what they did and how they managed to keep it a secret in an issue of Empire from last year.&&Batman 89 was filmed mostly in England. Batman reruns was mostly sound stages.

I got to see a few Batman Adam west spots when I was in LA, and saw just about every dark knight location I could legally access while in Chicago.

hoping they film the new affleck movie somewhere reasonable so I can visit that. love me some batman&&this one is in Cartersville. the town is a quaint little old timey town and they shot most of the earth stuff for GotG2 in that area (except the opening DQ scene which was about an hour away, even though it's supposed to be the same small town). I wanted to get more pics, but it was way too cold to walk around a anymore&&The owner is behind on the lease and many employees didn’t receive a paycheck. &&I was an extra in a music video about 15 years ago. never again. despite going to film school and knowing how the process works I was still shocked that a 4 minute music video took about 8 hours to shoot. so boring. and by the end I hated that song so much&&Yeah, Louisiana ended their tax credit a couple years ago as did North Carolina, and most of that business ended up flowing to Atlanta.&&May that be the case for low budget films? Even being cheaper to do it digitally, you need a vfx department to do that properly, which is still expensive for independent films. Also, there are directors who don't like to do things out of camera.&&yeah, some of those just floored me  

adding and removing trees I get (sometimes), but there was one where they added in a small yard lamp? I mean, I guess after the movie the homeowner could have removed it, but it just seems weird&&aspect ratio is easy enough, I toyed with that idea, but I like the idea of showing a little bit more, just to show what the area looks like

focal length is a bitch. back when I first started this I didn't know anything about compression (honestly sometimes it still throws me off) and I shot my entire LA trip on an upgrade lens at 10mm. couldn't figure out why they all looked so weird. lesson learned. I try to match focal length best I can, but sometimes it's just not possible&&Nice work! &&How did you get the list of places?

EDIT: oh man i could have gotten you into the building where they did all the chase scenes for baby driver. It was so cool to see a movie scene of a place I go to every day. Also fun fact, the baby driver chase scenes that are on foot are all ACTUAL pathways you can take, not just cutting in an out of him running in different places.&&Nice try, Nigerian Bureau of Tourism. &&They used it for training/science, afaik. Practical examples of how fires spread in homes are hard to come by. &&Book idea: in the future, instead of stopping fires, fireman cause fires. But what would they burn? Well, they're government employees, so obviously they burn things the government doesn't want the people to have access to. Like books they don't like (ooh, topical!)

Oh, this is gold! I should write this!&&I'm gonna go ahead and hope they used it as a training exercise. Although if it burned down I guess they probably need further training. &&Free roof pizza. Eww. &&What's one of your favorites- for whatever reason?&&Couldn't agree more. I grew up there (had forgotten all about Microcenter - used to shop there all the time!), and once I moved away I was amazed at how ""overlooked"" it was as a city. Now, it would appear, the secret is out. (See: film production, Amazon HQ2's presumed shortlist).

Pinewood Studios in Fayetteville (my hometown) is incredible. Compared to the studios in Wilmington - or even the studios in L.A. - the size is just massive. And it's just one of many - Tyler Perry bought the old Lakewood Fairgrounds and turned it into a production center. Even Shannon Mall, where I used to spend every Friday night in the 80's, is now a studio complex.

For lifestyle, Atlanta's also incredibly diverse - in food and population. Moving to L.A., I was shocked at how homogeneous SoCal was. It was as if they divided up the population and said, ""All you white people live here. Hispanics & black people, over there. Gay people? Head to WeHo. Koreans? You have your own section of town."" Where I grew up, we had a salad bowl of all shapes, sizes, and colors of people.

And the food is PHENOMENAL.

I had to move away because I outgrew the entertainment industry in GA at the time - now whenever I go to visit I'm amazed at what it's become. Both industry-wise and otherwise. I thought it was an incredible place when I was there - little did I know, I was just at the tip of the iceberg.&&Apologies. You're right. Was typing fast & went back to add the bit about Riverwood - meant to say the studio was in downtown Senoia and Whistlestop was Juliette. Thanks for pointing it out.&&Ah man, that fucking sucks. They were nice enough people, I didn't get out of the car, just snapped a pic and left from the passenger side. I knew they tried to put something up to stop the pizza throwers, but to now put up a fence, years after the show is done is terrible. My bf said they were really nice. Some people can just never act right and be courteous.&&Damn, you think with all the extra revenue the city must make from filming and tourism that they'd at least give the locals a tax break. &&How do you find beaches in Atlanta?&&never thought about the airport, but its huge for cargo delivery so makes shipping equipment probably easier and a little bit cheaper.&&Fair point. &&It's the perfect cover!&&If you hit up Vancouver while you're here, let me know! I have a handful of friends in the industry and know where a lot of different shows/movies have been filmed. &&I’ll definitely follow! Good luck! &&You make me hate the fact that there's about 0% chance I'll see something like this done of places I know, given the fact I live in a small country where english is not the primary language.&&People here love the economic boom. I hate the competition to try to enter the film industry now that everyone’s moving here from all over. Plus traffic already sucks here and it’s just getting worse.&&I live in downtown ATL and my building has been filmed in by Oprah shows, the exterior used in many shots, I live two blocks from the civic center. The traffic congestion movie shoots cause is problematic but, we need the jobs in atlanta. 

Coming from NYC the wages in Atlanta are terrible. I’m glad that Atlanta is starting to make a name for itself in the industry. Hopefully, that will drive growth and increase wages for everyone. 

Side note: I looked out my window and saw the street closed off and a SWAT with weapons drawn. I nearly panicked and thought there was a terrorist attack in my building.  Nope, just a movie shoot. They really should do a better job of spreading the word for things like that. 

When I lived in LA, Film LA would post signs days before they intended to do any filming in public. &&Not from Georgia but it seems pretty straightforward. Republicans believe in low taxes to promote business growth. In this case, film companies start filming in Georgia because of the tax breaks, the money they spend circulates in Georgia’s economy, and it’s a net positive for everyone. The film is still being released to the general public so its success or failure has nothing to do with the tax breaks really. They’re just to incentivize filming in Georgia. &&The government can participate in the free market-- there's nothing hypocritical about a conservative supporting that. Conservatives would object to the government  using extra-economic incentives  or monopoly power, but using economic incentives just makes the government yet another player in the market that, in this case, is full of other competing states that want the movie business (see antitrust law as well -- when the government is acting as a 'market player,' it is legally treated as one).&&Well, New Yorker who works in the film industry here: 

I respect it. That's how we took work from Hollywood in the first place, big NYC tax breaks under Bloomberg. Atlanta went lower and DeBlasio wouldn't chase them, and so we lost a lot of work. 

Still have all the Marvel/Netflix stuff out in Greenpoint though.&&I do Econ Dev. in a small rural community. The ROI has to be there and has to be carefully managed.

But if my town can do 2-3 things to make it more attractive, then why not? Often it's also an improvement for existing businesses as well. 

50 years ago cities could be ""fuck you. Where else are you going to go?"" and provide shit services, badly run government, etc.

Now business is mobile. Cities have to improve their product which helps everyone. 

Now plenty of cities just shovel money. That's never sustainable in the long term and further illustrates piss poor management.

We help with incentives but usually because the cost of a site being useful is so excessive nobody will take it on.  We going to let it sit dead for 50 years or find a partner and help them turn it into something productive?&&Because these tax break/incentive schemes designed to ""attract more business and industry to boost growth"" literally almost never work. Every single state in the USA and most major cities have these laws with varying degrees of severity, but only 10 states have official follow-up studies done to, you know, *check* and see if they actually worked years later. 

They almost never do. They are almost never worth it. The net job growth that is promised/projected almost never is even close, let alone actually hitting the target. Out of the net growth that *does* occur, a high ratio of them are those that would have occurred *without* the tax breaks. Furthermore, a high ratio of those jobs created were not available to locals, but were created by out-of-state professionals moving to the new location of their company. And the tax revenue lost per job can be ridiculous. Nevada just got Tesla's battery giga-factory and gained 6k jobs. Great, good job Nevada. It only cost them, the State of Nevada, **$200,000** per job created. 


And every fucking state does some version of this. NYC is just one of the first to figure it out and stop participating in this ludicrous race to bottom game.&&Lol, imagine walking up all excited to see rdj just as iron man is getting skewered by Thanos and you see peter dead by his side. &&Awww I love Cartersville, I want to go to the Indian Mounds there one day!&&Theres a closer mellow mushroom down 41 near Lake Allatoona. I live in that area and my friend was there for filming. It's pretty neat to drive by and see these locations. Thanks for the pictures. I love that Georgia has been used in big time films&&They also filmed a lot of that Ashton Kutcher as a hitman comedy up there too.&&thank you!&&Google mostly. there's a bunch of sites out there with all that info. some of them I was able to find based on signs in the movies (the post office robbery in baby driver, after he drops off bats, he drives by a street sign, so that was easy enough to find)

I did try to follow some of his running around, some of them don't make any sense, he somehow runs from hurt park to peachtree center in 2 minutes,  but it was still cool to see that some did match up.

what building are you talking about for the chases? the one I really wanted to see was the garage from the end/safe house, it was filmed in the gold deck at the dome (this one I actually asked Edgar Wright directly on IG since I couldn't find info online and he surprisingly replied), which apparently is closed now, so that was disappointing &&I love to hear that :D&&How about me? Can you get me in?&&For what it's worth, there's a Chase scene in Peachtree Center Mall, which is basically a big food court. It's open to the public.&&I'm going to remember that excuse, I mean reason, the next time I set something on fire just because. Lol&&Am firefighter. You are correct&&I'm wondering if there's people that don't get it&&I'd keep my roof clean if I knew there would be regular free pizza deliveries&&from this set or in general?

from this one.... probably the civil war parking garage. it was such a great scene and I really didn't think I was gonna get such a good match. there's lots of lines and overlaps that can go wrong, but I got damn close

in general, I got a shot in chicago from transformers. movie isn't great, but it's a of the skyline and I got it too match up 100%, it's spot on, but in the screencaps the city is destroyed and broken, while my pic is clean and pretty, just love the contrast of them&&Yeah, I don't think outside people understand just how AMAZING the food is in Atlanta. It's NYC and SF quality sometimes. There's just everything. In my neighborhood I had literally 100s of asian food choices (Duluth obviously, right around the bridge). Some of the best korean food in the country. And all the pho and bahn mi you could ever imagine. 3 dollar bahn mi bbq pork sandwhiches all day.&&:) I should’ve specified - the tax credit is for Georgia as a whole. So shooting in *Georgia* is really the ‘new Vancouver,’ although a large amount of production occurs in the Atlanta area.&&Yep. TBH, I think it’s more for talent and specific crew than it is for cargo, The other advantage to shooting in GA is that there’s already enough film infrastructure (camera, costume, post-production, lighting/gaffing, etc) in place that a production doesn’t have to ship too much of that in.

(Didn’t used to be that way, but it’s steadily grown over time.)&&The perfect makeover&&Will do, thanks. that's gonna be a crazy trip, that's like the LA of the North, way too much to see&&Not that happy about rent skyrocketing though...&&The Republican legislature in NC all but killed our film business by ending their tax breaks. Huge loss.&&It's more complicated than high versus low taxes. We are talking about tax credits, not marginal tax rates. Republicans often run on eliminating tax credits (regulatory capture, sweetheart deals) and lowering the marginal rates, but once in office, the regulatory capture and sweetheart deals remain in place.

This is a consistent complaint from libertarians and neoliberals, who ardently oppose regulatory capture. They think tax credits distort the free market. They give an upper hand to one industry over another, effectively subsidizing some industries while other have to get by without subsidies. This is something most economists on both the left and the right will always complain about. &&Only problem though is the returns on that. Movies get huge huge benefits for the very meagre amount of use that they generate.  &&I was not arguing about what the government should and shouldn't be able to do. I wasn't even necessarily talking about conservatives. I was talking about market liberalism, which is what libertarians generally preach. Think about how Rand Paul and Ted Cruz talk about economic policy. They are market liberals. Under market liberalism, the tax code is supposed to be the same for everyone. No special deductions, no special tax credits. Market liberals think deductions and tax credits distort the free market, and are susceptible to regulatory capture. The Republican Party in general has been complaining about regulatory capture for years, but every time they get in power, we just get more socializing losses and privatizing profits. Make no mistakes, special tax credits for certain industries qualify as regulatory capture. 

So it's not really conservatism, market liberalism, or libertarianism that I think is hypocritical. What is hypocritical is the Republicans tendency to oppose regulatory capture while running for office. Conservatives always complain about how Republicans break their promises on policies such as immigration, but if anything, I think the party's tendency to break promises on regulatory capture is miles worse. If they support special tax breaks, then they should run on tax credits and sweetheart deals. Be honest. Just my 2 cents.&&Interesting thoughts. I know macro economists on the national level tend to oppose these types of subsidies unless they are very carefully implemented. 

I think the danger is creating a regulatory race to the bottom, where everyone is competing with one and another for businesses. This seems to be an increasingly large problem in the film industry. But just look at what's happening with Amazon to see an even greater extreme. Some cities/states are literally offering giving them income tax revenue. It's insane. &&Hit up the booth western art museum while you are up there.

now, I usually start off with a main movie or 2 I want to see and plan a trip based on that. then ill Google to see what else was filmed in the area and make a list of ones I like. then I rewatch those movies to prep and make notes of locations I want to see. research those to see where they are and if they are accessible. then I put them all in Google maps and check out street views to make sure they still exist/look relatively similar. then I study the map and figure out the best course so I'm not driving in circles. 

once all that's done I put everything into a spreadsheet in order of how I will see them and then take all my screenshots. I number them to match their spot on my spreadsheets, Mark them up so I know what points to look for to match the angle, then load them on to Google drive so I have them to reference while I'm out shooting.

then its the standard come and home and edit everything and put together albums and whatnot.

First Photo of Zac Efron as Ted Bundy in ‘Extremely Wicked’,31228,7r4eaz,http://imgur.com/t8xWpij,1718,1516224056.0,,"I remember the original intent of the movie was to have the big reveal at the end that he was Bundy but somehow that was leaked or something.&&I hope he method acted for this the same way he did for *Disaster Artist*&&Glenn Howerton is my dream casting for Bundy&&[deleted]&&Question - was Ted Bundy super jacked with a 12- pack? &&Like many, I have a small obsession with serial killers. Cautiously excited for this one.&&With this and ""My friend Dahmer"" I think it's safe to say we are now in the age of serial killer biopics/films and im honestly thrilled.&&For everyone commenting about the differences in physique between Bundy and Efron, our interpretation of good looks change over the generations.

Ted Bundy was quite good looking and very charismatic. In his time he probably could have had any woman he wanted.

Zac Efron, right now, can have any woman he wants. Yes his body is different that Bundy’s but Efron is our general interpretation of good looking.

I believe they casted this way so that we can feel more involved with the film when they do go into the inevitable description of Bundy. Instead of thinking “I don’t get it, he’s not that handsome” we’ll be thinking “yeah I’d probably go out with this guy”.

Or they casted Efron just for eye candy and I’m just full of shit.&&I bet this will be just like *FoxCatcher* where Channing Tatum was suddenly seen as a serious and talented actor. It's not easy to get those teen comedy movies, you know Efron has the chops.&&That’s the guy from Married With Children, right?&&I think he may do very well in this role.&&I highly recommend checking out Bundy, by Matthew Bright. At times it plays out like a goofy comedy, which makes the film incredibly disturbing and weird. &&Tell anyone from the early 2000s that Zac Efron is playing Ted Bundy and they'd lose their shit.
&&Is The Rock and Kevin Hart in this too?&&I hope he brings that same Chris R intensity.&&I'm really excited for actors like Kistch, Channing and Pattinson. They went through the hazing of young acting and have come out as *still young* professionals, dedicated to the craft itself.

Efron hopefully follows in this same path.&&Mark Harmon will always be the one true biopic Bundy&&This reminds me, has anyone seen *My Friend Dahmer*? If you aren't aware it's a film based on an amazingly good graphic novel about a guy who happened to go to school with Jeffery Dahmer before and during his first known murders. I've heard pretty good reviews but not much any buzz at all so I haven't got around to seeing it.&&Very nice,but i would rather see a movie about Al Bundy.&&Interesting casting. Though, I feel like Michael Fassbender would suit the role better. He kinda looks like Ted Bundy, great at playing sinister/menacing characters, and is obviously a better actor. 

But this might be the role that breaks Efron's frat boy typecasting. &&Great on Zac for doing a more challenging role but I think it sucks that a movie about Ted Bundy is even marketable. The man should just be forgotten. That should be the real penalty for sociopaths. Being wiped from existence.

That would be a good movie. If your a convicted sociopath they go back in time and wipe out your existence from humanity.

He seemed like the stereotypical Disney pretty boy for so long but every time I see him on screen he gets better and better. He’s hilarious in comedy movies and has great dramatic chops too.

I hope he gets his game changing role like True Detective for McConaughey or The Departed for Dicaprio.

Police ignored her for a while because they didn’t believe a late 20s/early 30s College Grad, Law Student with no criminal record who was involved in politics, charities, and worked at a suicide hotline could be a serial killer. 

This movie is likely going to detail the abusive relationship they had, the multiple instances he cheated on her, the crimes he committed while dating her, and the things he wanted to do with her during sex. 

Bundy likely would’ve been a secondary character and the film is probably going to be told from her POV with her discovering he was the serial killer.&&What would he be doing all through the film if he wasn't going around murdering people?&&[Here's a side by side comparison of better casting.](https://imgur.com/a/a4X7x)&&That would have been cool as hell.&&I guess that explains why they chose Zac Efron, because he looks nothing like Ted Bundy.&&Damn, that would of been incredible.

I get that he's still young and he wants to probably have fun, but with movies like Dirty Grandpa, Baywatch, and Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates... he's probably already been written off by many. Hopefully he proves them wrong &&I think The Greatest Showman will make him a star.&&I liked him in Neighbors but has he really been great? &&Honestly I've always liked Efron, and he's usually one of the best parts of even his bad movies. I appreciate him trying to break out of his Disney mold with comedies, and he does have comedy chops, but he needs to ugly himself up for that career change like Brad Pitt had. &&Yeah is this like the boldest role he's taken on?&&I think I'm the only person that enjoyed Baywatch....&&He was pretty good in The Paperboy. That movie was damn disturbing. &&I dont know about that but he was considered very handsome and capable of serious charm. One reason he was able to lure so many victims.&&Serious answer - He was considered very handsome and charismatic&&He absolutely wasn't jacked, but he was lean and very fit. Ann Rule describes being surprised by how muscular he was under his clothes.. iirc I can remember Rule talking about how fit his legs were, but looking at pictures from that time, and especially from a modern viewpoint, he was absolutely not as ripped as Efron is.

But Efron seems to fit the role. One of the most fascinating things about Bundy is that he was just a very pleasant, very charming and nice person to be around. He was smart, had a fairly normal childhood (at least compared to other serial killers), had a career going, girls looked after him, but then his absolutely visceral, beastly urge took a hold of him.

His famous killing spree after he escaped prison, where he killed three (?) girls in one night and severely injured two, was one of the most brutal things I have ever read.

It's a terrific story, and his method of catching his victims, by pretending to have a broken arm or leg and then luring them to his car, was so effective because he was just such a pleasant, handsome man to them.&&He was 5’10” vs Efron’s 5’7”.&&[deleted]&&Ted Bundy was indeed 'super jacked' but the amount of pack is not proven&&[deleted]&&He was sort of blandly handsome, and slender.

He was not some California swimsuit model pretty boy, which makes this casting choice kind of meh. &&Fun fact: Ted Bundy actually helped the FBI from prison when they were stumped by the Green River Killer.

Dope.&&yup&&Well not that’s it’s much of an indication but Ross Lynch, another former Disney Star, did an amazing job as Jeffrey Dahmer in My Friend Dahmer. Efron is, if anything, very charming and charismatic, so I think he could definitely pull this off. This film could be very good.&&Having only seen him in High school musical and some terrible comedies and teen movies(17 again), Does he actually have any dramatic acting ability?

He's good in comedies, liked him in Neighbors last.&&Some of the things Ted Bundy did in real life were straight out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. The thing with the cast, the library escape.

It fits that he was so intense as Chris R because the actor who played Chris R is commonly referred to as the best performer in The Room. Definitely didn't phone it in.

I guess he deserves credit for pretty successfully moving away from the pretty-boy teen-crush lane, but he only made people forget about that by getting stuck in the frat-bro buddy-comedy lane instead. There are a handful of actors around his age (Kristen Stewart, Daniel Radcliffe, Robert Pattinson, etc.) who have pretty much laid out the blueprint for successfully navigating this really tricky phase of an acting career, and while I guess I can't fault him for collecting paychecks it's still disappointing. 

The frustrating thing (besides the inevitable ""It's an Efronaissance! Where's his Oscar!?"" narrative once he's in two good movies in a row and does a press blitz) is that his strays into indies have actually been promising, even when the movies haven't been great, but it doesn't seem like he ever commits to staying in that scene for too long. So even something like this is hard to get overly excited about, since I've got no reason to think it won't be followed by two years of bad comedies.&&[deleted]&&I might be the only one but I liked Mike and Dave &&Paperboy on Netflix is a pretty demented movie but he did a great job in that one I thought &&Have you seen The Greatest Showman?

He's not a deeply impressive actor, and he's also handsome to a point of improbability. &&Ever seen the Paperboy?

He and mcconaughey were brilliant in that. &&He also played on sympathy but it definitely didn't hurt that he was attractive. He often pretended to be disabled and walked with a limp or used a cane and asked for help with getting into his car and things of that nature. &&Damn, I've got to rely on self-depreciating humor and have played fallen solider a few times with a little success.&&He looks like Chris D’Elia to me so I have no idea why that’s considered attractive but it was the 70s and I’m straight so what do I know.&&Ok - I heard about the charisma, but wasn't sure about the looks. 
&&One of the best tweets I ever read:

Sorry, dude with a cast, juggling heavy bags. I can’t help you. Ted Bundy ruined that for everyone.&&Something that I find fascinating about him, that was a big reason it took so long for him to get caught, was how different he looked with different looks (I.e. beard, weight-loss). While these would make everyone look different, apparently he had an almost chameleon-like ability. He was also said to have been very handsome, yet not in a way that would make him stick out of a crowd. 

Overall I think Zac Efron is a great casting choice too.  I just hope he can get the whole “evil-eyes” thing down. I guess Bundy had that going on pretty bad. &&[deleted]&&Wow Efrons 5’7” had no idea.&&Not to noticeable &&Go watch the new Baywatch movie if you want to see how insane his body is.

And I don’t think there is a damn thing wrong with learning about the world, as horrific as some subjects may be. &&Well she **was** in an abusive relationship with and was madly in love with Ted Bundy, a compulsive liar who happens to be the basis for every charming killer ever portrayed in fiction.

It wasn’t until she found panties and jewelry that belonged to other women that she had suspicions of him cheating/murdering/being a creep/being a theif.

It wasn’t until he became more depraved around her that she started to think it was him.

It wasn’t until she read about similar murders + disappearances in Utah (where he was going to school) that she and some of her friends believed it was him.

Many of her friends also didn’t like him.

Edit:

From [this article](https://www.huntakiller.com/blog-articles/2017/8/2/best-friend-of-ted-bundys-girlfriend-speaks-for-first-time) about Elizabeth and one of her friends.

>”Strangely, Elizabeth continued to date Bundy even after reporting him to police. Marylynne did not comment on this. The two remained in contact until Bundy was executed, and he apparently told her that he had stayed away from her purposefully ""when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.""

Second Edit:

Having looked at the script online,  the entire movie is about her feeling immense regret about giving Ted’s name to the police as he fights for his freedom and maintains his innocence in court while displaying the traits of a psychopath in his social interactions.

It’s basically a movie about his life after being arrested in Utah.&&She did, admitted to thinking it was him to the police and then backtracked. She stayed loyal to him for years after.&&IIRC most of the times he cheated on her were when he was going to law school in Utah and she was back home in Washington.  (She and some friends of hers that had suspicions about him read about murders down there in the paper and contacted Utah police.)

Many psychopaths and sociopaths like Bundy are compulsive liars and cheaters who think they’re smarter and sneakier than everyone else. But they just have to make one mistake and they’re screwed.




When Bundy was finally pulled over and arrested one night for possession of burglary tools, police realized there was a girlfriend, some friends of hers, and another female friend of his (Ann Rule) who had contacted them about him. 

On his way to breakup a teenage party, an [officer]( https://youtu.be/Jki7_RCaobQ) saw Bundy speeding out of a driveway of the home where a young woman lived with her family. She was home alone. 

When he was pulled over and asked why he was out so late, Bundy cockily said he just got back from a movie .The officer asked him where he went and what he saw.

Bundy said he went to a nearby drive in and saw “The Towering Inferno”. The officer knew he was full of shit because he was stationed at that theatre most of the night and they were only showing westerns.

When asked what he was doing in that driveway, Bundy said he was taking a break smoking pot and got spooked. The officer didn’t smell marijuana.

When Utah police searched his car they found burglary tools. Officers asked him what they were for. Bundy said he was a law student, showed them his school ID, and said that they were for a presentation in one of his classes.



&&With corpses. Idk if that makes it any better&&And she specifically asked him not to. &&He was involved in politics? The horror&&dennis was the dayman you uncultured swine. mac was the nightman.&&aaaAAAaaa&&True the casting could be worse, but in that picture Bundy looks a lot like Mark Ruffalo (Ruffalo now a bit older though) , I wonder how that would turn out with him cast instead. &&Really? I can kind of see it. The nose, and lips are very similar. Give Efron the bushy unibrow and I think it works.&&Plus most people know of Bundy as “handsome” and “charming” but they don’t actually know his face. Zac Efron matches on paper and that’s good enough for suspension of disbelief.&&Wow! This guy monster. &&Which isn't saying much, the guy had been in one other film, an ""indie/romance"" *IRANgeles* and went on to do one more film, *Take Out* ... But I guess that is saying a lot for the cast of *The Room* 

http://m.imdb.com/name/nm1393926/&&Holy fuck I didn't even realize that was Zac Effron &&He was in like 2. Are you thinking Dave Franco?&&You didn't think of the smell you bitch!&&F-Fetish shit! I like to bind, I like to BE bound!!!!&&Dee, you stupid bitch&&The only difference is that Bundy wasn't creepy like that, he was extremely charismatic.&&I've always thought he'd make a great Joker, too. Like, in a 90s animated series inspired way. He'd be a total goofball until someone pisses him off, and then shift into that really creepy vibe like he does in that clip.&&I feel like it would be too on the nose. So long as Zac Efron's acting is up to snuff, I think his lack of association with playing a probable serial killer/rapist (tbh I don't know my IASIP stuff well enough to say if he's just a rapist or also a murderer) will help.

When I see Glenn Howerton acting, I see ""unhinged serial killer hiding under a surface of pleasantness."" When I see Zac Efron, I think ""Disney pretty boy."" Big difference.&&The jokes just weren't as funny IMO. I felt kind of cheated, because by the end of the movie I realized that all the funny moments were packed into the trailer.&&It's like Zoolander 2. They take the same jokes from the first movie and triple down on them; making it feel more like an over the top parody of the first one. Anchorman 2 did it as well. They even had the news anchor battle, but with ridiculousness turned up 100 fold.&&Efron reminds me of Channing Tatum in that way- typical fit white heartthrob type-casting, but god damn hilarious in a good comedic role (Jump St) and probably great dramatic actor (Foxcatcher was intense).&&The bar scene with him and Jackman was great, other than the part that they had 20 shots in a minute haha &&Neighbors was god damn hilarious. &&Hey, don't forget his character was at the premiere talking with Josh Hutcherson's Denny. Speaking of people who kinda aren't having a high point in their career right now...&&It was a small role, but yeah, he was great. This seems like the perfect opportunity to make the jump. Better to wait for the right one than go for the wrong project and ruin your chances for a good dramatic lead forever.&&Alright, alright, alright&&Which is why treating the latest young star as a 'flavor of the day' is such a stupid mentality. DiFuckingCaprio used to be a 'flavor of the day' fad too....&&Remember when Matthew McConaughey was only in rom-coms?&&After seeing Gosling in the big short ive just been crazy for more movies with him.&&Yeah I feel like Zac Efron was always in a really good position to break-out as a serious star because of his ... humble... beginnings. &&Uhh, High School Musical was great, what are you on about?&&I completely forgot ""Neighbors"" was called ""Bad Neighbors"" in other countries. Now I'm spiraling down a list of interesting movie name changes per region..&&Bad Neighbours was pretty darn good, as was the sequel. Definitely way better than Baywatch.&&she was much more established than Efron was by the time Rachel Getting Married came out. She was in Devil Wears Prada and Get Smart, for instance. She shed her ""Princess Diaries"" typecasting well before 2008&&She became acting royalty by the late 00's.&&Don't forget, Ryan Gosling was a Mouseketeer.&&I dunno. He’s funny in some roles but he’s always playing the same guy. I don’t know if he could ever break out of that mould since he seems to enjoy doing it

 Although, after Chris Pratt turned into who he is, who the fuck knows anymore. &&Daniel Radcliffe has been in a ton of shitty movies after Harry Potter. I actually can’t think of any movie of his I have liked other than Harry Potter.&&I love *Mike & Dave* so much, its one of my go-to comedies on HBO when I get high. I love it’s random deadpan humor

“and for god sakes don’t talk about blimps”&&People didn't like Mike and Dave? I thought that movie was underrated!&&Mike and Dave was also the only tolerable one of the three. &&Mike & Dave is funny. It may be a “stupid” movie but it’s stupid in a good way. &&So the guy who was only known as “high school musical” and being in shitty Nicholas sparks movies tried to change his perception and went into comedies and had a couple hits, and flops? Seems like y’all are just trying to pigeon-hole this dude and he keeps trying to get out of whatever stereotype he’s given. 


Also, High School Musical is good. Fite me. &&Mike & Dave to work with Aubrey Plaza&&Dirty Grandpa was fucking awful. It's legitimately one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I couldn't even watch Baywatch it looked so bad &&Mike and Dave is awesome. Shut your mouth &&Damn, I thought all three of these were pretty funny. Baywatch least of all, but Dirty Grandpa had me in stitches. I love seeing Robert De Niro not give af.&&You're not. Anyone I've talked to about it not on the internet thinks it's great&&Sounds like some sort of psychopath.&&clearly you're not charming or handsome like he was&&u kno when ur dad cries after he kills people and then u have to go to bed &&[I think Efron is a pretty solid casting](http://media.tmz.com/2017/05/16/0516-zac-efron-ted-bundy-getty-4.jpg)&&I personally don't find him very attractive but I can see the appeal. He was decent looking and in good shape when he was in his prime serial killing days.&&He looked good with a [beard](https://78.media.tumblr.com/b9533cf1386423a7fc0cec8143f1840e/tumblr_owndf9pBT11vmcr92o1_1280.jpg).&&He was famously handsome, he's probably considered to be the most handsome serial killer. &&That was the tactic Buffalo Bill used in Lambs. When I found out years later it was based on what a real serial killer did.....yeah, it ruins being a Good Samaritan.&&Hey now! What wrong with 5’7”??&&Really? Didn't know that but it makes perfect sense.&&Amazing book. Anyone even somewhat into true crime should read The Stranger Beside Me.&&The Stranger Beside Me was really good, and Bundy is definitely one of the most disturbing.  I just finished The Night Stalker, and Richard Ramirez was much more vicious and disturbing in different ways, but (thankfully) not nearly as prolific.  Highly recommended, though, if you are into that kind of stuff!  It goes pretty deep into his childhood, which was all kinds of fucked up.&&I’ve also read that Bundy was furious that their crimes were being mixed up and mis-attributed. Nothing beats the ego of a serial killer. &&Buds? I don't think serial killers think like that lol&&*Logan Lucky&&[deleted]&&Selena Gomez is Ted Cruz, The Zodiac Killer.&&For all we know she very well may be. &&My favorite part of ""Neighbors"" is when Zac Efron and Dave Franco are sitting on the front porch after terrorizing Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne.

Franco says ""I don't know man. As a child of divorced parents, I feel kind of guilty about all of this."" Efron then responds ""Well my parents are happily married, so I think this is hilarious.""

They then proceeded to go on a promotional tour for the movie with their main selling point being how ""our frat characters could have just been stereotypical douchebags, but the great thing about this movie is that in this one the bad guys are 3-dimensional"" LMAO

Edit: For the record, I'm not commending neighbors. It was literally the characters spelling out their motivations in the least subtle way possible.&&The internet&&Charlie St. Cloud. Never seen it but assume it's bad because a frat at my college used to haze new members by making them watch it on a loop&&Charlie St. Cloud which was passable. He was good but the narrative stuff was kinda meh &&He could definitely play pre-death Bundy.  If you’ve seen the picture of him post electrical chair he looks shockingly like Fassbender.&&Fassbender looks old and sharp, which isn't what Bundy looked like. You're going to have an easier time applying makeup for such a role if you cast a young actor with a rounder face.&&There's a bit difference between our curiosity and personal interests, which are completely understandable, and making a movie about such a figure with Zac ""12 pack"" Efron&&She sure got lucky, wow. &&Bundy is one of the ultimate shitheads. He probably left her because he could get no more sexual thrill from her because how much he was getting into necrophilia and thus saw no purpose. When he was locked up away from human contact he spun this new story of ‘feeling the sickness building’ what a total psychopathic prick.&&Man can you imagine how fucked it up it would be to be devastated to find out your SO was cheating on you, then soon realize he was also a SERIAL KILLING SOCIOPATH?

Dunno I’d be bummed out&&And Ann Rule went on to a career writing true crime books. &&> When asked what he was doing in that driveway, Bundy said he was taking a break smoking pot and got spooked. The officer didn’t smell marijuana.

This is the most ass backwards thing I've ever read lol.&&> said that they were for a presentation in one of his classes. 

The man’s a monster but you can’t deny that he was sharp as a tack. That’s a great lie. &&> with corpses.

That he went back to for repeated visits after they began to decompose.  That was the whole point for him: to be able to possess them completely.  He was very much a necrophiliac, and didn't want people to know even after he was caught.  He chopped their heads off, took them home, put makeup on them, and had sex with the heads.  He went back to bodies repeatedly after they were dead and used them.

We think of him as just a serial killer but he was waaaay beyond your average serial killer.&&[deleted]&&That honestly should have been the first thing to tip them off.&&I think you should cast who you think will play the role better instead of who looks more like that person as long as they are passable as the character &&Oscar Isaac would be my first choice. &&That's what the dude you're replying to is saying. He is saying it could have been worse.&&That's also true. I've met a few cast members and Dan and Robyn are universally agreed upon as standing out as two of the more talented actors. Again, like you said, not saying much, but yeah.&&Oh shit I totally was haha thanks&&I will cut you up into a tiny million little pieces!&&The outtakes of this scene are some of the best ever.

Check when he is trying to get the waitress to do something for him&&Dennis was a much more charismatic character early on, he only became that way later as all the characters became more Flanderized. He could pull it off. &&Sadly common with comedies. On the other hand it's a good litmus test - if the trailer doesn't make me laugh, I don't need to worry about bothering with the rest of the film.&&Yeah but will Efron put on a gimp mask and hump some legs? &&I saw that as a night's worth of negotiations told quickly to save time. Otherwise, alcohol poisoning lol.&&Josh Hutcherson as Denny was amazing&&I liked Future Man a lot&&I love the story, no idea how true it is but it’s funny, of two producers out to lunch stuck on who’s going to play Robin in Batman and Robin. One producer asks a kid “Who’d win in a fight, Chris O Donnell or Leonardo DiCaprio?” The kid said O Donnell. Leo got rejected and went on to do titanic &&Damn right it was. &&Cool runnings in the Czech Republic is called Coconuts on Ice 🙄&&Please share....&&well yeah, in 2005 she had that car sex scene in BM. her career was only about 4 years old when that happened, Zac has been around for about 14 years now (since he was in Summerland) and i’ve still been waiting for a great dramatic role from him (and i’ve long thought he’s had it in him). i hope this Bundy movie is the one for him.&&Or Matthew McConaughey starring in bad love movies. It's refreshing to see actors grow out of their old etiquette.&&That didn't turn him into a big star, though. No one was like, ""We'd be crazy to cast you in this movie, you were a Mouseketeer!""

I remember Justin Timberlake going on a podcast and talking about how over time people have kinda built that cast into something it wasn't (since it's really impressive to look at years later), when in reality him and Gosling/Spears/Aguilera joined while the show was on its last legs. &&As much as I love Chris Pratt, he's the same character in Jurassic Park, The Magnificent Seven, and Guardians, a more dumbed down version in Parks and Rec and The Lego Movie, and a little more serious in Zero Dark Thirty, Passengers, and Moneyball. 

He is great in everything he's in, and definitely a good leading man, but just like Adam Devine, he's a very formula actor. &&I loved that movie too, and I don't even get high...&&I don’t get all the hate for it. I thought it was funny as fuck.&&Why would you give me an old tomato?!&&[Dude.](https://imgur.com/a/YCqIq)&&She was in dirty grandpa, though&&It was pretty bad but I still loved [Jason Mantzoukas in it](https://youtu.be/3ksuZ6_Z46M?t=69). &&Did you expect any different from a movie called *Dirty Grandpa*? I mean, if you told yourself five years ago that you voluntarily watched a movie called Dirty Grandpa, what would you think?&&Baywatch was fine. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Seems like it was a fun movie to make and I think it shows.&&Then you haven't seen any truly awful comedies.&&F@%$ off. Dirty Grandpa was hilarious.&&Baywatch is actually ok. It's a formulaic comedy but it has a few genuinely funny moments.&&It would have been the worst comedy I have ever seen if it weren't for Aubrey Plaza who made watching it not a complete waste of time.&&Baywatch was much better than Dirty Grandpa.

Add to that some smooth talking qualities and off we go to murder everyone. &&Bob Saget lookin ass&&I think [Hugh Jackman](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/27/00/3390EC9500000578-3560553-image-a-5_1461714153015.jpg) could pull it off too...&&He looks like a dead ringer for Justin Theroux in those pictures&&Looks like the grownup version of the Jewish kid from It&&Most handsome serial killer that’s been caught*&&I think it's important to note that Ted Bundy would go in public settings with many people and ask short, thin women (his typical prey) to help him carry stuff to his car. I remember Ann Rule saying that a person who actually needed help would've probably asked a stronger man to help carry things to their car, especially when there are many people in a public space to choose from. And Buffalo Bill...I mean, it was nighttime and the dude had a total serial killer van. Basically what I'm saying is you can still be a Good Samaritan, but just ask yourself if the situation seems off beforehand, and don't be alone with strangers. &&""I only watch movies with actors 6 foot and above""&&Nothing I’m 5’7” it’s just I assumed he was taller&&Nothing.....'swipes left'.&&Well, buffalo bill is more like ed gein(Texas chain saw massacre takes from his story heavily), but dr. lecter consulting the FBI is based on bundys green river killer discussions.&&I think teens an young adults should read it just so they can get an idea of what bad people do to trick and lure in their victims. My high school English teacher suggested it for me, and I feel that the knowledge I've obtained from that book has helped me avoid some hairy situations. &&That would be amateur hour. Have her play [Genene Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genene_Jones), the nurse who was suspected of killing up to 60 infants under her supervision. They only had enough evidence to get her on 2, though. &&She probably thinks being born over a decade after the last Zodiac murder exonerates her too. Ha!&&After seeing 21 jump street I’m pretty sure Dave Franco is capable of playing any beautiful asshole villain I hate and love in any movie going forward&&It's not that bad. It's marketed towards a teenager/young adult audience and is basically about how to cope with loss and heal from trauma.&&It wasn't bad. Wasn't great either. Effron actually did very well in that role. Guy has range.&&Not really. If Bundy killed her he would have been at the top of the suspect list. He got away with so many murders because the girls had no connection to him. && She was probably too ~~young~~ old for him. When Bundy was arrested in Florida they found magazines of middle school cheerleaders and color guard girls among his things. His last victim was a middle school aged girl. God rest her soul.

Although he did have a relationship, got married at his own trial, and had  a kid while he was in prison.&&More so probably because if he ended up killing her he'd be the top suspect. &&Oh it was even more fucked up than that:

>There were women’s underwear there and the plaster of Paris,” is what Marylynne heard from Elizabeth. The plaster would be used to make the fake casts that Bundy used to elicit sympathy from his victims, luring them near his car by asking for help and then kidnapping them. Elizabeth said that when she questioned Bundy about the items, she was threatened.

>“She said 'what is this?' And he said to her, ‘if you ever tell anyone this I’ll break your (fucking) head.’” Marylynne stated. She also stated that Elizabeth decided to ignore this troubling behavior for the time being and continued to see Bundy, despite Marylynne’s concerns.

>Elizabeth told police a similar story about the year before her and Ted split: “Ted went out a lot in the middle of the night. And I didn’t know where he went. Then he napped during the day. And I found things, things I couldn’t understand.” These items also included crutches, a meat cleaver, surgical gloves, and a sack full of women's clothing.


&&She already had a career writing about crime. She was already signed to write the book on the killer that turned out to be her friend Ted Bundy. This book just made her famous. &&And gave birth to Ja, who was a beacon of hope during Hurricane Katrina.&&>This is the most ass backwards thing I've ever read lol.

In that his excuse was crazy or that I worded it funny? 

If it’s the latter: Bundy was waiting in a potential victims driveway when he saw an unmarked cop car making its way down the street and sped off. He told the officer he took a break on his way home to smoke pot in an abandoned driveway and got spooked by the unmarked car, speeding off because he didn’t want to get in trouble. Bundy said he threw the blunt out the window but the officer didn’t smell pot in the car or on Bundy s clothes.&&Wait...WHAT?&&Right? Now it's even hotter&&Is it really cheating if her heart isn't beating?&&Couldn’t agree more.  In the past couple of decades or so, there have been a few performances (Denzel Washington in Malcom
X, Jamie Foxx in Ray, Sir Ben Kingsley in Gandhi, Helen Mirren in The Queen, Marion Cotillard in La Vie En Rose, or Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln to name some) that are both nearly identical physically and basically disappear into the role.  However, as compelling as these performances are amongst many others, I find it more fascinating to see actors/actresses portray actual people without necessarily looking anything like them.

Both Frank Langella and even John Cusack capture the essence of such an iconic and compelling figure as Richard Nixon, despite not really looking incredibly similar.  It is enough to get the idea across, but their portrayals are what earn me over.  Same thing with Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding.  Not that similar looking - but the performance is compelling and authentic enough to make you forget about for the duration of the movie.&&You should edit your first comment to all caps to fit your username &&This is about the thrill of wearing another man's skin.

Danny McBride stole the show in This is the End.&&Channing Tate-YUM!&&He made me laugh every scene &&Future man on hulu is pretty damn great!&&That means there's an alternate universe where Chris O Donnell is Jack, and Leo is Robin.&&After watching Sahara, it was very apparent that McConaughey just does not give a fuck. He probably got paid really well just to act like a parody of himself on a really shitty Indiana Jones vacation in Africa.&&I think Chris Pratt still has somewhat of a range compared to Devine though. 

He’s still very much someone with a similar presence in each film, but he can still have some “serious” moments when he needs to.  

I haven’t seen much from Devine to suggest that he could expand as much as someone like Pratt. &&Pratt needs to play a villain, with no charisma. 

I think he can do it. &&Obviously you're unfamiliar with blimps. &&yeah it’s like Eurotrip or Harold & Kumar 2 where it looks generic at first glance but has an awesome sense of humor and will gain appreciation over time. it’s so damn funny&&The way he says ""these people don't *matter*"" fuckin kills me&&Mantzoukas is the GOAT comedic cameo guy.&&Lol I’ve seen him in at least 5 different shows and movies and he basically plays the same character every time. He’s so damn good at it though. &&He's one of my favorite actors right now! &&to be fair no one was expecting anything out of a movie called ""monster trucks"" and that's on track to win every single oscar.&&I thought baywatch was funny and I found dirty grandpa entertaining regardless of how dumb it was, I think it was so damn dumb I found it funny, I think I have a soft spot for Effron though because he always makes me laugh in the movies he's in, I can understand why people wouldn't have enjoyed them though.&&It helps to smoke a joint. &&Not as much of a jerk as that Albert fish fella&&the more i learn about him, the less pleasant he seems&&Aaaaannndddd that's why you're single.

Edit: /s in case it's not obvious&&fuckin go to bed &&Bundy looks a lot like a [young DeNiro](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-cdn.9gag.com%2Fphoto%2Fae042KB_700b.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2F9gag.com%2Fgag%2Fae042KB%2Fyoung-robert-de-niro-is-hot&docid=xD0LORdw7qE31M&tbnid=xvvaKlF88XC93M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjP69KtzODYAhVOleAKHYJYAL0QMwhNKA8wDw..i&w=528&h=800&bih=779&biw=1536&q=young%20Robert%20DeNiro&ved=0ahUKEwjP69KtzODYAhVOleAKHYJYAL0QMwhNKA8wDw&iact=mrc&uact=8) - I'd say that's easily his closest comparison to an A-lister. Maybe a dash of someone else

&&Well, you have to think of it this way. Most people in movies are more attractive than the average person in real life. The bar is higher. So if a movie wants to portray a person as being more attractive than average, i.e. if being attractive is part of that character’s identity, then you need a very attractive actor like Efron. &&They do look alike, in the eyes and with a different hairstyle I could really see it. I hope this isn't one of those roles where I can never unsee the actor as the character though!&&I think Hugh Hackman has played too much of a rampaging mother fucker to do a serial killer. I would just picture him going ham whenever there was tension. &&He's well known for both singing, dancing and plunging fist-knives into people's chests, so. Probably safe to say that there isn't much he can't do.&&Holy shit, he does look like Justin Theroux. Slightly unrelated note, but Theroux is my dream pick if they ever decide to actually make a good movie based on Max Payne.&&More like James Franco to me.. look at the eyes.&&which one?&&-shivers-&&HAPPY BIRTHDAY!&&NEXT!&&Dr Lecter as a character is a culmination of a bunch of serial killers and psychological illnesses/disorders.

When Thomas Harris wrote the books he did research with the FBI and interviewed a prominent profilist who helped make Lecter seem more realistic, which in my opinion is why he's so offsetting.

The books are an awesome read and Anthony Hopkins did an amazing job portraying him. 

Edit: spelling holy moly I should pay attention when I type LOL&&Buffalo Bill is kind of an amalgamation of six different serial killers, it’s kind of interesting: 

Gary Heidnik is arguably one of the most revealing ones because it’s a very unique MO of kidnaping women and keeping them in a large pit in your basement. 

Ed Gein, though not a serial killer, is the other big one, what with his fascination with the female body and his making of suits and masks out of the corpses he dug up and skinned. 

He also had the fetish of Jerry Brudos, the actual fascination of *being* a woman.

He has the background of Edmund Kemper, what with the murdering his grandparents at a very young age. 

He is also seen using the MO of Bundy himself by feigning injury and asking for help carrying something in order to overpower his victim. 

And he is in fact based on Gary Ridgeway (Green River Killer) which is interesting because Ridgeway was still 10+  years away from being identified and apprehended. He initially dumped the bodies in the river and lodged objects inside them. &&He actually did try to kill her and her daughter once, during a time when he wasn't able to go out and find a stranger to victimize. 

I read her book, she said he admitted to her that one night he blocked her chimney to try and kill her with smoke inhalation, she woke up and got all the smoke out before anything happened. At the time she thought it was a mistake. &&Uh yeah but SHE got lucky he didn't kill her. The other girls got... Un-lucky...&&Ohhhh that makes more sense. I need to do my research!&&You mean too old for him?&&> and had a kid while he was in prison. 

I feel like people like Bundy, who also have conjugal visits, should be sterilized prior, in an attempt at avoiding passing on those tainted genes. &&Wait just a minute.... He has a kid out there??? I've never known this. Do they have an alternate name do you know? &&> These items also included crutches, a meat cleaver, surgical gloves, and a sack full of women's clothing.  

Jesus Christ!? Was Ted Bundy dressing up as a disabled woman and sneaking out to work at a butchers shop at night? I bet he was doing it to earn more money to pay his bills. He must have really loved his wife.&&Where the fuck is Ja? We need Ja!&&> 
> 

No, he's pointing out how it's ironic that the cop is the one trying to deny the existance of marijuana&&Just that his excuse was crazy lol. 

In just about every other scenario, you have someone who *was* smoking weed, tells the cop they didn't, but the cop smells it and is suspicious. 

In this case you have someone who *wasnt* smoking weed, telling a cop they did, and the cop being suspicious because they *can't* smell it. 

It's just such an inversion of the typical scenario I had to chuckle. 

I'm cycling between it being fucking stupid that he would admit to a fake crime to the cops, and it being brilliant because a cop is likely to buy the story since why would someone just randomly admit to smoking pot to a cop?&&Yup.  He was Silence of the Lambs Buffalo Bill level crazy.  In fact they used his trick of putting a fake cast on to trick women into thinking he was injured and thus harmless and sweet and needed nurturing before he bonked them on the head and did really horrid things to their corpse.

The woman they're talking about in this thread, who dated him, had to fake being dead so he could fuck her or he couldn't bring it off.

He didn't just do it to adult women, he murdered little girls too. ~~And he ate parts of them (not the kids his other victims).~~  He was way the fuck out there.  Texas Chain Saw crazy.

They had theories that he either paid off a guard or passed her a used condom through a kiss. Yuck. &&This sounds a little extreme. Borderline eugenics. &&I’m pretty sure Bundy actually DIDN’T have conjugal visitation rights with his wife. I think the theory of how his wife got pregnant (theyre not 100% certain to this day) is that Bundy jacked off into a condom, tied it up, then hid it in his mouth (I guess under his tongue?). Then when he saw his wife in person during a regular visit (like in the movies where the inmates family visits them in a room with cops and they sit at a table), he kissed his wife and transferred the condom with his sperm that was in his mouth into her mouth. She then took out the condom when she was out of sight and used Bundy’s sperm to get pregnant. The alternate that somehow Bundy bribed a guard to look the other way or allow him to use the conjugal visit room despite not having the right so that he could bone his wife is horrifying...&&It’s a daughter and her name isn’t public.

He was really worried someone who lived in the house he was casing was coming home.&&I'm kind of aghast at some of those claims, disgusting and horrific. But I wonder what that guy's sources are on the specifics of necrophilia and the heads, I've read quite a few books on Bundy including the one written by the man who did his last interviews, who hsd been chasing him for a decade or two, and read transcripts of his interviews - and Bundy was notoriously reticent about what he did when revisiting the sites of the bodies. He was very eager to have a certain image of suaveness if you will, and my understanding was that he never did give specifics in certain areas before his death. I don't see any good sources for the heads and makeup stuff. Both of those sites are shock value type articles...   
 Not that it couldn't be true it's just new to me and since the man is dead I thought I'd read everything there was on him. He really was black inside. It used to scare the crap out of me reading about him since the majority of his movements were near places I lived. &&Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy are similarly 'crazy'.

This isn't the best analogy. A better analogy would be if someone made a satirical comedy about George W.

You should watch the film. It's very funny. &&Fuck censorship, no matter the date. &&Thank you providing the official narrative used to support the ban. As you've pointed out, this film would be analogous to a film about the death of Bush being released on the anniversary of 9/11. I don't think many Americans would bat an eye at that.

The victory at Stalingrad had very little to do with Stalin, apart from possibly by supporting his generals to be as brutal as they wished. In fact, Stalin made the USSR vulnerable to invasion in the first place by purging the army. Stalin terrorised and decimated Russia. So maybe a better analogy would be releasing 'Look Who's Back' in Germany on the day of Hitler's death, which probably wouldn't have caused much uproar, because most people love to see the villains of their history cut down by comedy. It's cathartic. In any case, I think you'll agree that the official story that the film was temporarily banned out of respect for the anniversary of Stalingrad is not very convincing.

The Death of Stalin describes a ruthless and ineffectual oligarchy locked in a selfish power grab fit for a high school cheer squad, not the leaders of a nation. I think the most obvious reason it's release was delayed was because it is embarrassing to Putin and his cronies. The film is a very astute criticism of the current political regime in Russia. A group of oligarchs selfishly engaged in a race to enrich themselves and kill their opponents, while producing some of the most embarrassingly blatant propaganda seen since the fall of the USSR. The fact is, they should be embarrassed. Putin is an embarrassment to the human race.&&“We need to pull this subversive film. How can we justify it?”

They’re called tankies and they’re a blight on this world &&> It's bizarre that Russians are apparently so sensitive to satire

~~They're~~
 we're not. A select group who happened to be in power are. They want to preserve the image of STRONK LEADER MAN and just project this image on whoever is/will be in charge, keeping the machine going forward with sluggish stability. Over the last few years Stalin has been thoroughly whitewashed, and to the rest of the population it's extremely disheartening.  
Unfortunately, the older population eats it all up, and they're the ones who go to the polls on voting day. The younger generation doesn't have time for all this voting nonsense, they'd rather bitch about the oppressive regime on Facebook.  
So yeah, not sure what my point is, but there you have it. Russia is a country of great contrast. You just see the side that shines the brightest. &&Russians can handle this movie just fine.

But their leaders aren’t. &&[deleted]&&Russia is not a free country tho dude&&There is a little bit more to it than that, the banning of this movie was the result of a ripple effect in Russian culture that started in politics.

I’m not an expert on Russia but I’ve been once or twice, i travel that area of the world often, I know my history and I read a lot.

To outsiders it seems strange but the reality is Russia has never been democratically run, and it never can be. Russia is monumental in size, it covers a huge area of the Earth and it encompasses countless different cultures, beliefs, and identities. It’s size is it’s biggest strength and weakness, it gives Russia space from its neighbors. There are little to no natural mountains or dense forests that separate Russia from Western Europe, so they expanded East to allow for retreats during wartime. They employed this tactic when Hitler tried to invade and it worked well, even if the poor timing of Hitler proved to be the most destructive factor. It’s also it’s biggest weakness, outside of Western Russia it’s another world. It’s hard to explain but it’s the real Wild West and it’s pure chaos. Authoritarian leaders hold it together, without a Tsar, a Lenin, a Stalin, a Gorbachev, a Yeltsin, or a Putin there wouldn’t be Russia. It would break apart to infighting and the various regions would become separate states. Russia would disappear over night. It’s nearly happened in modern times but Putin avoided it.

The problem is Putin will die, and he has no successor and there is no telling what will happen when he dies. It could spark a civil war, infighting to the East or another authoritarian leader will emerge. Putin is dipping in popularity and he’s losing his grasp of the regions. Dagestan has been a big concern lately and they are defying Moscow more and more. The regional authorities are slowly growing more and more defiant and they are seizing power for themselves. Putin is trying to hold it together and one of his strategies is to bolster the idea of a national identity. A myth in Russia because it’s so big. He took to rebrithing Stalinism in a sense, he’s using Stalin to appeal to the older generations and working class. It’s like Trumps MAGA. The banning of this movie was a show, it was Putin saying Stalin needs respect and Stalin was a great man, and Stalin is doing what Putin is doing so this must also mean Putin is a great man. It’s hard to explain, but that’s kind of the gist of it. He’s creating a cult of personality and then highlighting how alike he and Stalin are as leaders and he’s hoping this will boost his popularity. Sochi, and Crimea were also examples of Putin trying to make Russia great again. He’s trying to push the national identity in a hope that it will hold the federation together.


Russia is a mystery, and it’s also familiar. I would recommend visiting to anyone. When Putin dies it will be the dawn of a new era, an era of tighter state control or an ear of war. Inter-state relations are very tense right now, and Moscow can only subsidize the entire country for so long. The international sanctions are truely crippling Moscow and money is running out. You don’t need to travel far in London, Berlin, Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam before you run into a large mansion owned by a Russian millionaire. People are fleeing, and they’re bringing what’s left of the money with them. &&>free country

We're talking about Russia right?&&I think there is also a huge difference between foreigners making fun of something Russian, and Russians themselves making fun of it. Very different perceptions and levels of tolerance. I imagine it's not just a Russian thing. &&It's not Russians, it's the government. I've read few russian articles about that screening, and actually a lot of people enjoyed that movie, in one way or another. Even people in their 70s/80s who attended the screening, said that there is nothing wrong or insultung about that movie.&&Nationalism and patriotism are two completely different things. &&There's no legitimate reason for a free country to ban any movie. By doing so, they cease to be a free country&&You must be retarded or painfully naive to actually believe that Russians are supporting those idiots in charge of making such retarded laws, censorship and restrictions. If anything, the drama about that movie would only fuel the interest to it more and people who couldn't care less would watch it one way or another. Basically the same thing that happened with Mathilda.
Also there is nothing wrong with patriotism at all. There is a huge difference between harmful propaganda that is targeting naive people and distracts them from the internal problems, oligarchy and corruption and proper patriotism that any country can and should have to sustain their unique traditions, culture, etc.
&&I think you're looking for the word Jingoism&&It’s not a free country.  The only difference between modern Russia and Stalinist Russia is that modern Russia has a veneer of “democracy”.  &&Free country?&&Russian culture, and most eastern European countries, has a sickness called ""My farts don't smell"". Even if they live in the poorest Russian village on a dirt floor, they will own at least 2 mink fur coats that cost more than a years salary, or if you're a dude, the most expensive Adidas brand clothing and car upgrades for your 1988 Skoda. 

The worst part, even the dumbest and poorest Russian genuinely believes they are ""better"" than any European. During communism, in Slovakia, the russians would parade around like they were God's chosen children and they made sure you knew it. Doesn't matter if they only had 3 teeth and a kindergarten education, they would talk down to you like you were beneath them simply because they had a golden age of culture like 100 years ago and they're still talking about it. Russians are the 2nd fakest people. If you know a Russian that isn't like this, it's because they don't live in Russia anymore for a reason. 

This isn't universal, but it is why they suck so much as a culture.

Edit: If you're wondering who the #1 fakest culture is, it's Japanese. If you don't know why, you don't know the Japanese for the last 1,000 years.

The US is the guy who can kick anyone's arse in a standup fight. But perhaps because of that, they're not aware of how to deal with a guy who is physically weaker than them, but a master a manipulator...&&Agreed. But they are more like exceptions, plus they were released long time ago. Nowadays Russian studios sometimes make good movies but still most of our movies are trash imo&&There is quality, problem is that there is an insanely high amount of shit. &&It's more that anything that questions or laughs about people of power is viewed as dangerous to people in power.

Stalin's purges weakened the Soviet military so much that most of the Soviet war deaths in WW2 can be directly blamed on his paranoia having gutted his own country's defensive capabilities.

Also, the mass starvations, both deliberate and as a result of chaos and incompetence, virtually annihilated the credibility of Communism in the West, and the fear he inspired in Germany made people receptive to another mustachioed psychopath.  So basically everything Stalin claimed to represent, he discredited or eviscerated.

Stalin destroyed the Soviet Union twice over - first directly, then by gutting its ability to defend itself from Germany.  What finally emerged from the devastation was a deformed, mauled society in its very soul.  That's what gave birth to the likes of Putin.&&THE GREATER GOOD. &&In trying to make his own backwater country more powerful Putin has been attempting to destroy all of the social progress made by the Western world.

The thing is the majority of people don’t think like that here. They see western propaganda and provocation everywhere. And they will be unhappy with the government if nothing is done. &&Russian society is very anti-individual. Niche things are often criticized and looked down upon, especially if they undermine mainstream ideology. This makes Russians very intolerant of things that don't match their sensibilities.&&and even if people were upset about it, our government wouldn't ban the film. &&No, the Iraq war was controversial before it started and GW's approval ratings [only got worse and worse over time](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).

Everyone acts like retards, kill for no reason, nobody cares about nobody and everything looks like total shit no one in their mind would want to live in. Damn, I'd check that out.

1. Stalin ignored or dismissed frequent warnings that Russia was about to be invaded.
2. When Barbarossa did go into effect, his response was to go into a fugue state and hide out in a cabin somewhere, having to be persuaded to eventually emerge and lead his country.&&Started reading in russian accent after stronk&&People seem to blend a country's government with it's citizens a lot of the time.

And later said that it's because of the Stalingrad anniversary, even though it has nothing to do with the movie.&&A Question: 

What would people in Russia say when you asked them what they associate with Stalin and would that differ much depending on age?

Because my impression from your comment is that he is mostly remembered for turning the tide against Nazi Germany (and as a symbol of russian resiliance and national leader, father figure etc) and I'd guess based on that, that people are vaguely aware of his ""flaws"" but don't care too much...&&Sounds like the GOP&&I agree. I was just trying to respond directly to the 9/11 analogy. The situations are definitely different.&&Russia succeeded in *spite* of Stalin, not because of Stalin. The purges had left the Russian military very weak, and the division of Poland via the Ribbentrop pact led to Germany sharing a border directly with the USSR. Stalin was in denial about the impending German invasion, and when the Germans did invade, he obstructed the work of generals many times, leading to unnecessary casualties. &&Where did you get those two points?&&1. Not so simple, the country was not ready for the war and Stalin was trying to buy more time. The topic around the days prior to Barbarossa worth an r/AskHistorian thread
2. This is just not true, Stalin was actively meeting his top brass starting June 22nd 1942, as accounts and visitation journal clearly shows&&it's funny... because i did too.

and i pictured Peter Stormare.... as  Abram Tarasov from John Wick 2.... which is weird because the actor is Swedish..... but damn does he do an entertaining thick russian accent.&&Maybe safety is your number one priority.&&Not only that, we're treated like the majority of us support the government, as if it reflects ""American values"". It doesn't. Lower class values are the same world wide, we want food, shelter, medical treatment, and education.&&That’s because the populace is complicit for any act of the government, given that we all collectively allow them to exist. Excusing the populace for the crimes of the state means nobody is at fault and nothing will change.&&I definitely felt this living in Europe during 9/11, G.W. Bush, Iraq. People were constantly making comments about how Americans are stupid, rednecks, love violence and war are uncultured and ignorant. It came from the way American government was portrayed at the time and I sensed the resentment even as a young middle schooler.&&> People seem to blend a country's government with it's citizens a lot of the time.

Israelis experience this x1000.&&[deleted]&&> People seem to blend a country's government with it's citizens a lot of the time.

IMO it's because ultimately the citizens ARE responsible for their government.  I chose to pay my US income tax which supports the murder of civilians around the world, I choose to not stand up and resist my nations leaders, to overthrow them if necessary.  I do this because I'm selfish; because I'd rather live my relatively comfortable life than have my property confiscated, be imprisoned, or killed resisting my government.  But I don't delude myself and say I'm still living an ethical life because 'I didn't vote for Trump'. &&This. More and more I’m coming to realise that Governments are companies with the illusion of being “Governing bodies for the people”. The disparity with how world governments act and what their people want is just becoming lunacy. Can’t believe any of them remain in power!&&Shut it, yank.


/s&&I feel all the good guys from russia and america should leave and make a new country. And be the first to mars and fuck both countries out of the picture.

Infact youre all invited to Australia. Lets start again here.&&The majority of Americans didn't vote for Trump. Does the world know he won with millions of less votes than Hillary? Thats what you need to tell these people.&&the main russian social network is vkontakte (VK for short), though FB is also used by some/many (mostly those with contacts/friends in the west)&&There are three major social networks in Russia: OK (Odnoklassniki), VK (vKontakte) and FB (Facebook, obvsiously). I sorted them according to perceived trashiness of the majority of user base.  
This may sound elitist, but casting political correctness aside, here's what we have:   
* 
OK is a bit weird in a sense that it started off as Odnoklassniki (literally classmates), catering to the school crowd. But now it's sort of split between the schoolkids and people over 40 who still relate most to the school friends (as opposed to university / work friends). Overall, its quite popular among the unambitious people who mostly live away from central hubs (so-call Provincia).  
* VK is the most popular social network in Russia. It secured its place on top thanks to several key factors, such as responsive and fast development (lots of different features unrolled early, it kept improving for a while, at the same time trying not to become as bloated and convoluted as Facebook), libertarian approach to media (for a while you could find pretty much any movie or show here, but then they've since struck deals with copyright holders and essentially provided subscription video on demand services to users; same goes for audio - it's very easy to create own playlists accessible to users anywhere) and, well, I guess porn played its part - yes, there's a shitload of porn at VK. Also, memes. Yeah, there are a bunch of public groups with several million subscribers each, and they spew entertainment over its users on an hourly basis. Unsurprisingly, almost everyone in Russia who's online has a VK account for one reason or the other, even if it's only to access a playlist or browse dank memes.  
* And then there's FB. Most Russians here are 'enlightened individuals' for better or worse, who use the platform either to communicate with overseas contacts (friends, coworkers) or as a digital soapbox. Oh, and all those working in digital media prefer FB over other platforms. If something has something to say about the state of things in the city/country, it will most likely end up on Facebook, rather than other social networks.&&vkontakte (VK) is the home-grown Russian version. Both VK and Facebook are popular, with many young Russians having profiles on both sites.&&>the older ones are surely the ones that know its all bullshit?  
  
They want stability and strong leadership. Once USSR fell the country was in the shitter with the mob calling the shots for a few years. Shootouts on the streets, hostile takeovers (with AKs and grenades, not with stock buyouts and lawyers) and empty grocery stores. They're 'sort of okay' now, and they prefer this 'sort of okay' over the uncertainty of 'the turbulent 90s.'  
>Perhaps there's the angle that as you get older you want to believe only the good bits happened in your life.  
  
Also yes.&&No, it's not, actually. Voting is legit here, but the ruling elite always ensures their victory by any and all means necessary.  
Recently there were municipal elections in Moscow. The ruling party (United Russia) lost in a lot of districts thanks to grassroots movement of those who were fed up with the status quo. Funny thing is, people are more likely vote for municipal deputies here than for the president. The logic is quite simple: I live in this district, and I think this guy will actually make a difference, because he actually lives here as well. As for the president, well, my vote doesn't matter, we all know who'll win, anyway.  
See, the problem isn't that elections are a sham - they're not. People believe they're a sham and don't come, and those who are *encouraged* to vote, well, they do - and that's why United Russia and the current leaders always win. Because everyone already expects them to.&&There's a key difference. We smile only when we mean it.&&That was irrelevant then, and it's irrelevant now.  
BTW, the Russian statehood supposedly began with a Viking chieftain who was invited to unite the Slavic tribes.&&And Catherine the Great was German. Russian military man Johann Georg von Browne was Irish and German. [Russian military man Abram Gannibal was African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Petrovich_Gannibal). 

Russia and the USSR were empires, don't be shocked if a minority or foreigners become very important in such an institution. I mean, Benjamin Disraeli, British PM, descended from Italian Jews.&&You mean apart from the president?  
*Ba Dum Tss!*&&Can't speak for my family, but personally I think he derailed what could have been a British-style parliamentary monarchy, engulfed the country into a bloody civil war and paved the way to further atrocities.  
&&Oh yeah, big time.  
He's the big guy who shoved it to Hitler.  
Repressions? Gulags? Secret police? Naaaah. Kicked Hitler's ass, though, he sure did!&&An unfortunate number of communists on Reddit defend his actions. &&Can I sign up for one of these Putin thought/feels? &&Vladimir Zhirinovsky&&Enough times to know Russia can never be run democratically apparently...&&Those sandle-wearing goldfish tenders?

Typo or extremely obscure reference?&&Yeah people really want to pretend the efforts haven't had an impact, but they clearly have or trump wouldn't be in office&&But /r/latestagecapitalism is actually for communists, not socialists.&&Yeah haha......that’d be crazy right? 



*sweats Sovietly*&&Gulag. Go to Gulag. &&Trotskyist ideology is even more fucked up than Stalinism, so it's not exactly aa cheerful thing to do.&&So basically every political sub on Reddit?&&What even is that sub?&&It would have to be like the South park Scientology episode with a big ""This actually happened"" box put at the bottom of the screen for the whole film.&&I mean, I still got it but i think other people didnt because the exact quote was slightly different from how you said it.&&You might want to edit it to add quotes...

Happy cake day&&Needed a /s at the end I guess....&&My bad, but you could put it in quotes and attribute it next time.&&Right? I swear people can't resist those little Russian boys.&&Btw the gas was almost certainly a Fentanyl analogue (carfentinil possibly). There's some good research into it out there.&&This movie isn't banned either, it was just protested against by some religious people. &&I love this it works on two levels&&https://youtu.be/NPiGJBHVadA&&Easily the most annoying, patronising to say. Particularly when you have no proof&&The Minister of Culture is a joke with a plagiarized doctoral thesis. Either he didn't actually watch the movie and just wanted to support the 'party line' or he did and... well, wanted to support the 'party line.'&&That’s pretty much right for the majority. There are those who will be more negative towards him and those more positive but this depends less on the age, and more on geography I’d say. Those people that live in Moscow and generally large cities and are globalized so to speak, are more likely to be more negative, than those who live in the more remote areas (which is also the majority), regardless of age. 

And even then, there are exceptions. I have friends that are in their 20’s and have internet and have traveled and lived all around the world and  yet extremely patriotic and see only the good in post war Russian main leaders. This is just a cultural thing here. Patriotism is very strong all around. We are sort of like red necks. And like I said before people are very conservative. They think America is trying to take over the world and take our resources. The Nazi germany is thought of as a plague that had to be fought in any way possible. 

On reddit and in the West the point of view is generally anti-Russian but if you look on Russian forums or hear conversations, they are mocking the West in exactly the same ways, providing arguments and proof. Both sides are being bombarded with propaganda in some ways IMO. I can often see the same news on both the Russian news and say the BBC which will state the same things but each word it ever so differently so that it’s interpreted in different ways. This is even comic at times. 

I often wonder which side is the right one, or whether having ‘a side’ is maybe a wrong approach altogether. &&The first is [common knowledge.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2006_Soviet_war_documents_declassification)

The second, also [widely reported](https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/lost-opportunity-operation-barbarossa-and-the-decision-not-to-kill-josef-stalin/) (I read it first [in this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barbarossa-Russian-Conflict-MILITARY-PAPERBACKS-ebook/dp/B008B8KRQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1517019446&sr=1-1&keywords=barbarossa)), but by virtue of the nature of the event, no-one can be 100% certain it went down exactly like this - both Molotov and Kruschiev say it did though. And they would a) know, b) be in a position to be able to tell something close to the truth. &&> Not so simple, the country was not ready for the war

Of course it wasn't ready for the war - because Stalin had been ignoring all signs that war was imminent.

Otherwise a very enjoyable movie!&&Ah.. mine was Alison Brie's exaggerated style, which was fun to do.&&So what you're saying is... ""Workers of the World Unite""?&&American values are different than the rest of the world regarding the poor, by design

mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.

Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five

&&Plenty of poor in the US that voted for the exact people that has always, and will always, deny those things to the poor (and poor in this case those that can't afford all of that straight up out of pocket). US Lower class values are different than that, and I lament that every day.

If the poor would vote in their interest (fully tax funded health care, education, strict environmental and worker laws, etc) the political climate in the US would swing like a baseball bat.

I hope the silver lining of the shit show we're seeing here (were they accelerated the usual BS) is that the swing actually happens and stays long enough for political reform to solidify across the board.&&It's not our fault your political system is so fucking terrible a minority can vote your leader in.

The only people who have the right and means to stop a government are its own people.

Even those of us who didn't vote for him are responsible for this mess, it didn't happen overnight, it didn't happen just this election, too many people choose blissful ignorance instead of getting involved and talking politics with people and working to bring light to problems and show people why things matter

We can come through this stronger, for that to happen we need to face all of our shortcomings&&> independent foreign polling.

Yeah, how do these poll work, exactly? I was called a few times over the last few years and as soon as I hear ""I'm from blah blah, we're calling to ask you a few que...."" I say ""Sorry, can't talk now, bye"" and hang up. I know that I'm not alone in this attitude towards pollsters. And, well, we all know people who do like to talk about their opinions.
&&On point, comrade!&&> Moscow

Which has always yielded the lowest numbers for Putin during elections. On the other hand, you have places like Chechnya who vote 99%+ for Putin. &&As long as Putin keeps arresting his opposition, your elections aren't legit.&&yeah, and also ballot stuffing. which does happen, even though people like to claim otherwise despite video evidence and eyewitness accounts, and kind of automatically renders any elections illegitimate.&&I don't understand how you can say voting is legit and the ruling elite ensures their victory by any and all means necessary in the exact same sentence.

Yeah, Reddit is very american dominated. I'm German and what you describe regarding Russian forums sounds somewhat familiar, not necessarily the mocking but that beyond the English speaking Internet there are a couple of other, quite well self-contained bubbles where people speak other languages: Chinese, French, German, Portugese(?), Turkish and very prominently Russian, you see the latter clash with other such language spheres if a game or so doesn't allow people to self segregate and you suddenly have french and russian speaking people in your CS:GO match and both sides feeling entitled to speak their mothertongue which doesn't fare well.

Picking sides seems often problematic in my eyes. You named the BBC ...I wouldn't call it Propaganda but British Media generally seems to have a more aggressive stand towards Russia than for example Mainland European Media, I figure thats partly an echo of Cold War politics where Mainland Europe had to arrange itself with the existence of the Soviet Bloc within reach while Britain was able/choose to go another path, closer tied to the USA and somewhat seperated from Europe. You see a similiar diversion from Europe in the British attitude towards Israel although there France also takes a more confrontational stance, both being partly rooted in them playing a role in the creation of Israel (which they opposed and wanted to avoid with the Sykes–Picot Agreement). For example German (media) attitude towards Russia is less confrontational, Americans and Brits might see that as small scale finlandisation which is (argubly) true but there are reasons beyond that why the relationship is less hostile...it helps that Merkel is the only head of government who Putin can talk in Russian with.

I don't like TV news networks generally because their reporting outside crisis & desaster reporting is generally pretty shallow and heavily influenced by the Network's agenda...the BBC is better than most and in my eyes *definetly* better than RT but it too has its flaws. I wonder what Al Jaazera's coverage on Russia looks like. They have a lot of people formerly from the BBC and while their independence from the Qatar government has apparently become worse but I figure they might be far enough removed from the whole situation that their politics don't impact their reporting on Russia too much.&&I'm lucky it really didn't bother me that much.

Thank you so much, it was from Slaughterhouse Five, and I thought it was from a movie.&&It's not just the USA. The poor are used by the rich, who know that the poor are suffering and promise good and paint the pain as from the left. Then when they cut social services, they'll add in a little $50 bonus or something so the poor feel paid. It happens in every country that has a neo-con style centre-right. It's fucking infuriating, because on average the better educated (who are generally wealthier) vote more left wing, even though the people who theoretically ultimately benefit most from the left are the less educated, poor. Who also votes right wing, the wealthiest. &&Plenty of poor people vote in their interest. Poor black communities have been voting for their interests for decades, but gains are always the slowest to come to them and other poor minorities. 

Somehow, they’re always left out of the conversation when we’re speaking about modern class politics even though they bear the brunt of it.&&The poor vote in what they believe is their own interest. It just so happens that they are led to believe that their interests are in the right/center. The left isn’t a political position in the US.

&&> The only people who have the right and means to stop a government are **its own people**.

That's a highly controversial notion given even recent history. I applaud you for saying it.
&&Something you’re missing is that revolution can only (and has only) worked in circumstances of popular support and military sympathies. So a reformist and revolutionary will go down the same path (Lenin was a Menshevik, for example), and the split occurs when there is enough popularity for there to be a winnable war or coup, and whenthere’s enough popularity to start winning elections. 

Also consider what would happen in a leftist revolution. It would constitute an almost complete stoppage of industry, as the workplaces of the country are organized under revolutionary forces. Popular revolution is a very scary thing and that’s why ruling classes try very hard to keep that from happening. 

Also, popularity doesn’t have to come from electoral politics. It can be from direct action and organizing, such as mutual aid, community projects, tenant and workers unions, alternative infrastructure, etc etc && You think people would just line up toe to toe with the military? We're poor, not stupid.  If N. Korea can cyberwarfare the US you don't think some angry anons couldn't?  Also,  you gonna drone strike the middle of NYC, or LA? Since fighting would most likely be largest in the cities, you know, the places tanks avoid like the plague? Drones need controllers, so target the controllers.  It can be done if necessary. &&Jeez dude, I was just saying I agree that american politics and media portrayal of government effects how Americans are treated abroad.  Relax.

I have now recently seen a few people bring this up as one of their favorite movies, people note it's unique visual style and I've heard the soundtrack called a ""masterpiece"". I'm genuinely curious how old the average Tron:Legacy super fan is, simply because I didn't hear from them for so long. &&I was hyped for the trilogy that was supposed to happen&&Daft punk End of Line 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥&&I kind of love the criticisms of legacy, because the original had all the same sins and worse. Personally I love the film, but people hate it with a passion.&&This franchise doesn’t get enough credit, I wish we could get at least a comic book series&&Hey, we're only 20 years away from the same amount of time that passed between sequels last time. &&Nice work. Do another of Quorra or Gem?&&One of the best justifications for having a thousand dollar subwoofer&&Thank you! Love it.

I started working in a cinema when this came out. Was an awesome job with great people and this movie added to the magic of it! 

Soundtrack, visuals, story - Jeff Bridges! Amazing. All that coupled with young love, good friends in a decent job with no sense of future... ahh take me back. I threw that away for a “career” & my life hasn’t been as fun. Ah well.&&This is so nostalgic, I remember watching this when I was 10 or 11 and loving it to death. &&Can we start a petition to get another Tron please? C'mon internet, we can do this!&&I’d like to make you a offer of £200 for it &&This painting seems luminescent, very cool&&/r/tron&&I grew up on the original. Loved it. It was everything when I was a kid and, like you, hoped one day for a sequel. When Legacy came out, I was in heaven.

For both our sakes, I hope we see another.&&I saw this film in the IMAX theatre which is one of the largest and most sophisticated sound systems in the world. Completely blew me away.  What a soundtrack. &&Tron Legacy is so underrated&&I fight for the User!&&This movie is the reason I went into my career in motion graphics. &&One of my favorite movies of all time if I'm honest. &&Still some of my favorite movie visuals. Ever. Hope to see more stuff like it in the future &&This soundtrack and the remix album were solid. Lots of Daft Punk and Glitch Mob&&So hope for another chapter.&&Everyone should read Tron: Betrayal. It's one of my favorite graphic novels ever, and details the lead up to Legacy. Lots of cool stuff in it, and it just looks damn Beautiful. &&That's incredible. Do you have anything else?&&I love this! I love this movie. I'm bummed it didn't directly cause a sequel, and kind of shocked because I think it was really well done. Keep that faith alive, friend!

Also, I did a little fanart last year. :) https://imgur.com/DH3brVd&&I can't remember what the games were called.&&Underrated movies&&To all the iamverysmartartists out there. Calm. The fuck. Down. OP obviously put this up here because OP is a fan of Tron legacy and made some fan art. Yeah its not a fucking da Vinci. If they wanted a critique OP would have put it in the title. It was pretty obvious that he's a fan making fan art. An ""artist"" who thinks someone has to conform to their standards is more of a nazi than an artist. Bunch of assholes. OP I enjoyed it, and I hope you continue with this stuff, I hope it continues to make you happy. &&I fight...for the Users!&&Great visuals, great story, great soundtrack. It's a real shame that they haven't bothered to continue the franchise :( &&Best. Soundtrack. Ever.&&Thank you. Tron Legacy is such an under rated movie. &&I'm wondering why you bothered to watermark it?

It's a cool painting but I dont think any professional artists are gunna start using it in promo material or anything...&&I am waiting for the original soundtrack to be released

That one that was leaked before the movie was releases

Tributed to The Third Twin&&It sucks that John Carter ruined this trilogy, I really liked this movie. Also this.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iIMb3hGzWW8
&&Awesome painting. I️ have the same feelings towards this movie. &&Such high potential, but wasn't executed correctly. I really hope we get a sequel cuz I liked it as well&&It's one of the only movies that I didn't enjoy but I listen to the soundtrack repeatedly. I wish Daft Punk did more movie scores. 

My biggest issues with Legacy are how they handled Flynn and Tron's characters. It was as if the writer and director never watched the original film. It's pretty, it's beautiful, but man is it hallow when it comes to character development. &&Before they bought Lucasfilms, I always thought this movie was Disney’s quasi-answer to Star Wars! Jeff Bridges totally goes full Jedi Luke in the last half of the movie! &&So, no critique on the painting? Or is everyone trying to be nice about it?

You have some good progress made on the fingers and visor lighting, but the rest still looks flat. 

Since you used [this](https://idigitalcitizen.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/sam-flynn-disc-right-2560x1440.jpg?w=2560) image as reference, I don't know why you didn't do a sketch first. The freehanded disk and misshapen head stands out rather strongly.

The detailing for the suit fabric and bezels are also very messy. Try using a finer brush, or an ink pen.

As for the film, I would not want a second one if it's the same quality as the first; it fell flat in the box office for a good reason. But I keep Legacy in my library simply for its music and vfx, which are just on another level.&&Nice! Back in high school I made [my own Tron Legacy inspired painting](https://austinthefreak.deviantart.com/art/HIDE-465218350) as well. The character on the left is my own creation and obviously the green was a deviation, but the city design was pretty much lifted straight from the movie. It glows under blacklight too!&&Visually amazing, although the original is great and you have to watch that first to understand a lot &&Great stuff. I, too wish for another film or at least the cartoon getting another chance. I also with The Black Hole remake had happened but oh, well.&& Loved it. And I love this. I hope they make more too&&That was a fukin good movie&&Watch the animated series disney made after.

Better than the movie and excellent.

Plus Pee Wee Herman plays a villain.&&Love the movie love this !! And I hope and hope we get another one.&&God I love tron. Awesome painting. Op if you haven't seen it check out [Tron: The next day](http://tron.wikia.com/wiki/File:TRON_The_Next_Day_(Flynn_Lives_Revealed))? &&Good visuals and sound but bad movie.  &&I love this!! I want Black Hole so bad.... I loved finding out about the movie when I was playing KH2 - dad came in while I was playing and immediately knew the Tron level
I was on, said it was a good movie and I should check it out. 

Been history since. I fell in love with the 1982 movie, was super stoked about the new one, in college I made a room in 3Ds Max and made it to the theme of Legacy, also modeled some old light cycles as well. 

I hope they bring it back for the final one, finish the story. Uprising was a nice fill but I want more!!!&&Glad to see others that liked it as much as I did. &&Another cult member here. Love that flick.&&Love this! Your style kind of reminds me of the artist Matteo Scalera and his work on Black Science.&&Really cool.  Reminds of the drawings from Tron Uprising.  Like this awesome [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkK35ZcEZgc)&&Dude! &&Worst case scenario you will get a Tron coaster down in Disney World.&&If you haven't, watch Tron Uprising. A solid single season that deserved much more.&&Doubt it.. Disney murdered TR3N and turned it into a shitty infinite runner clone.&&Yes&&How much do you want for it if you are willing to sell? I am a big fan myself!!&&Well just have to settle for 'ready player one' for now&&>and hope that we get a sequel one day.

Keep the spirit alive, brother!&&Ever watch Tron Uprising??&&Cheers! Awesome work &&Doing God’s work.  Good on ya.&&Had to make a movie trailer for a class in my 2nd year of college, decided to dissect TRON Legacy- it had to be for an existing movie and we could use parts from the entire movie for our trailers. I used the main track so that blaring through my laptop for about 8 hours straight while I edited and my god- it still holds the same amount of gravitas as it did 5 years ago. &&Greetings program!&&Gorgeous film, if you enjoy the cinematography then go watch Oblivion. &&I will second the soundtrack to that movie.  One of the best movie soundtracks ever.&&I fell asleep when I watched this, I'll try and give it another go one day &&Bro idk alot of people here but I think it was pretty good &&i didn't understand why it was rated so bad. i quite liked it. &&Nice job, I love it! I loved that movie, I couldn't understand why no one else appreciated it. &&I both love and hate the use of only blue and white in this.&&Thankfully these movies live on in the Kingdom Hearts games&&did you ever get to watch tron uprising? it was a disney xd show. it was generally loved, but got the shaft for timeslots before getting discontinued. the only reason i got to watch it was illegal streaming.&&One of my favorite movies, and while I admit that I would like a sequel, it would be cool if Tron became a once-per-generation spectacle. If the next film doesn't come out until 2040, imagine how amazing it will be. && Also loved the tron part in Kingdom Hearts 2&&I love this movie too and would love a sequel!!! I just play it in the background to listen to the soundtrack &&Looks like tf2 scout&&That's very impressive!&&10/10 would buy that painting&&A lot of people shit on this movie but I remember absolutely loving it when it came out &&That’s excellent&&Justin Sun, is that you?&&I also love the movie. Really underrated to me. &&Well, if the pattern holds we'll get a sequel in 20 years now. &&I approve 
&&What determines if your art blows up here? There's just so much great stuff that gets overlooked. Anyone got that secret formula ?&&Probably the most underrated film of all time&&I love this movie. The visuals and soundtrack blend perfectly together &&I love DP *and* Carlos’ work both for being uniquely different but perfect for their respective movies. As an original TRON fan all I wanted to hear was a subtle nod to the original iconic TRON theme...just one little section. But it was nowhere to be found. :(&&Tron legacy is one of the most underrated movies I’ve seen and it’s one of my favorites. Hands down the best 3D movie I have seen. I have a feeling that this movie will become a major cult classic in the future. &&Trx to the moon&&The entire movie was awesome, i was hoping for Tron 3 when they announced it last year, then cancelled it. It was a success, :(&&I liked the sound track better than the movie. The movie was not great.&&I almost died while watching this movie and ended up not watching the last twenty or so minutes of it.  I still haven't finished it and honestly don't think I ever will.&&Amazin movie! I’m a also a fan&&The film was good, well better than a lot of other crap that gets sequels. The animated series was good watchable for a adult as well. Sucks they abandoned the franchise. I guess it was in preparation to slap together star wars. &&Vastly underrated movie. Not just visually amazing but a good movie period with a well done story and great performances all around.&&Fantastic movie.  Totally underrated &&A cult classic that deserves more credit than it gets. Great movie and spectacular drawing. It looks like concept art. Awesome job&&I’d like a sequel to John Carter as well. &&Nice job, very cool.  Might steal this for my phone background.  Tron Legacy was amazing, the third installment keeps getting postponed unfortunately :(&&They HAVE to bring back Daft Punk!&&Quick question,, are all of you com sci grads?&&The anime [Tron Uprising](https://youtu.be/7HHwhOcA6Kw) is also very good.&&I listen to the album to go to sleep often really is a great film wish they done another &&Literally just started watching Tron Legacy now after telling my co workers how I don't understand why people don't rate it yesterday and I see this. It's a hell of a film.&&This movie is so underrated. I would kill for a sequel.&&I watched it this week. It was interesting to me how many parallels Flynn has with TLJ'a Luke Skywalker (different of course, but with clear parallels).

I hope Disney realizes how much of an audience they have for it.&&/u/rindrop&&To be honest, it's kind of funny that Disney has never tried making a proper Tron game.

Given how the sequel ends, you could easily have a game start out with the player playing as Tron, perhaps even customizing his appearance (since he's digital anyway), and have him finding ways to connect with the outside world, with various technological landscapes (I love the aesthetic they did for Tron Legacy, but for an entire game, some additional environments would be good, too).

Wishful thinking, I suppose.&&Check out Echo Arena in VR. &&Sick &&Just last week I played Tron 2.0 for what may be the 135th time. The game is 14 years old and it still holds up in my opinion. If they were to somehow make it widescreen, I would be ecstatic. &&One of my favorites. &&I loved Tron Legacy, it’s visually spectacular, and the Daft Punk soundtrack is amazing! I live in Orlando and I can’t wait until they open the new Tron rollercoaster at Disney World&&Tron is amazing. The costume design and CGI is incredible. &&Just...WOW.  I had to really look at it to see that it's a painting.  Exceptional work!&&Pretty average you should practice more&&Hey, I remember this movie! Cool stuff. The music and art in it is amazing, as is your painting!&&This is awesome&&Good job🤗🤗loving it. Keep the good work&&We recently got a new 4K TV and home theater system and this was the #1 movie I watched to enjoy our new setup. It was incredible. I actually enjoyed in so much I brought my mattress into the living room to watch it out there.

Next up is Art of Flight. I love movies with incredble visual and audio effects and beautiful sound tracks. Anyone else have good examples of movies like that?&&THIS HAS A PULP SCIFI NOVEL PAPERBACK COVER LOOK.  CAPS WAS ON BY MISTAKRLE BUT I JUST WENT WITH IT.&&This is phenomenal.

I can't stand how much hate this movie received.

I loved it.&&This movie is the reason I put together my home theater system.&&Tron Legacy *was* the sequel.&&I fight for the user&&Get Dennis Villeneuve to direct it and you'll get a good sequel. &&r/tronix&&I think there's a sequel coming in 2020&&Where's the VR game? It would be so easy and look so good. &&Still remains one of my favorites. Awesome job man&& The was a cartoon series if that helps you any. 

Edit: if, not of.&&I absolutely love this movie and the original. I have it in my videos and I’ll rewatch whenever I travel. &&The TV show was awesome! unfortunately it got canned on a cliff-hanger.&&It's too late for a sequel, try a reboot
&&Well, actually Legacy is the sequel already, so you're asking for a threequel, or second sequel.

From wikipedia:

> A sequel to the first sequel might be referred to as a third installment or threequel or second sequel. A sequel that portrays events prior those of the original work is called a prequel.&&Seeing this in IMAX 3D was fantastic! I wish so badly I could go back and see it again. I'd honestly even pay extra money.&&Glad someone else feels the same it was a great movie&&Tron Legacy is in my top ten films of all time. I love it a lot, everything about it.&&I'm super bummed that we'll never get to see any more Tron. I kinda liked Legacy. Bummed. &&Makes me fucking nostalgic
&&This movie is the greatest full album music video of all time.&&wow.  that’s insane. just watched this again with my roommate last night. it’s our favorite movie. terrific job. pm me if you consider doing prints. &&This is so cool do you do commissions or a website
&&This movie had one of best pump me up scenes - the build to to the light cycle battle. The music etc. Made the hairs on my arms stand up.&&Tomorrowland flops so Tron 3 cancelled because reasons.
-Disney Logic.&&[Shanghai Disney](https://youtu.be/taeucixxrdM) has a full lightcycle ride&&And they had that elecTRONica area. Bummed they don't at least still have some Tron merchandise at the California park
&&That Tron event was soooooo fun! They had professional frisbee throwers just chucking identity discs over the crowd, a lazer light show, a dj in a tower at the center of the lot, glowing drinks being served and the full 80's arcade. Now it's replaced with the lame ass mad hatters tea party. I still have a Flynn's Arcade token to remember that awesome time.&&I wish there was more merchandise from that event. I also wish that I had gotten a bucket full of the tokens.&&I was so heartbroken when I went back one day and it was gone! I wish they had at the very least left the arcade, it was so much fun &&Yeah man, that was the best. And they played good music at those pg-13 raves. &&Dude I found out about it THREE DAYS after it closed. I was SO PISSED. Still am. I feel like I missed out on the greatest experience of my life. &&This was the coolest Disney experience I ever had when this was going on!&&ElecTRONica.... Nothing they've had since has lived up to that, crowd-wise. They also stayed open later back then (I think either 12a or 1a?). The whole countdown thing was cool too. Everything since then has been lackluster and doesn't even draw crowds... it's basically just whoever wanders over there. &&Man, ElecTRONica was the best! That whole backlot area of Disneyland California Adventure was the coolest when it was Tron themed. All the other evening themes just don't measure up in my opinion.&&I made sure to keep some of my Flynn arcade tokens!&&Daft punk did an awesome job on the sound track and the scene where they dj in tbe club is my favorite&&It's my go-to chill movie. The perfect combination of audio & visual.&&I'm not usually a fan of 3D movies, but I saw Tron: Legacy in 3D when it was in the theatres and it was absolutely stunning. It's still one of my most fond movie going experiences.

It really bums me out that the series didn't continue :(&&One of my dreams is to do a cut of this film as an extended music video.  No dialogue, just Daft Punks soundtrack and the amazing visuals.  I have the same idea about Interstellar.&&This soundtrack, and Queen’s Flash Gordon soundtrack, are the only movie soundtracks I have on my Ipod.  So good.  The Son of Flynn is my alarm clock in the morning.  Such a great track, and excellent movie to boot!&&7 years later and it's still probably the best movie I ever saw in 3D/Imax. That was an absolute thrill, and besides the obvious DP soundtrack, one of the mains reasons it became an instant favorite of mine.&&>Visuals

[Quite a feast](https://i.imgur.com/7qcLIlk.jpg)&&I love the audio and visual presentation, but I also personally loved the story in the film (I’m also a sucker for father and son films and movies about the search for perfection, Godhood, and existence). I thought that they did the Hero Journey better than the new Star Wars films and I’d rather see a sequel to this over the sequel to the Last Jedi.&&It's basically the best Daft Punk music video we could have asked for. &&or how someone said 

tron is a live show of daft punt&&Yes this movie is my secret throb&&""Hey Daft Punk, can you do the soundtrack for the new Tron movie?""

""Can we.....can we be in the movie?""&&Whenever someone says 'not not' I always think of ""Why do you have Randy Jackson's signature on a samurai sword?""&&It’s digital jazz, man&&Dude don't worry about what other people say about a movie, music, or a game. What you enjoy is entirely up to you.&&It's not even a guilty pleasure to me, I straight-up think it's a great movie. The lukewarm response is totally baffling to me.&&While I disliked the movie, the world it is in is amazing and should have a cultural following on par with Star Wars. There’s so much potential and the original was a favorite of mine growing up. It’d be great if they had people explaining the tech and it got involved on a deeper level with hacking and different languages and every other possibility if the tron world got hooked up to the internet and just went wild. I also watched reboot as a kid and would steal ideas from there as well for games which really just stole ideas from tron&&Same. Also, Speed Racer 😶&&It's a good movie that could have been a great movie. They were close. &&Dude just yesterday, I told my friends that Legacy was one of my favorite movies and they COMPLETELY SHAT ON ME. I was shook&&I don’t understand what’s so “guilty” about liking this film. The story is solid, albeit simple, the acting is good, the visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack is amazing. Yet every time it’s brought up “long daft punk music video” is the only good thing said about it. &&My new guilty pleasure movie similar to this in terms of reviews/reception is Valerian and the city of a thousand planets. I dont care what you say, you can't deny WETAs CGI work in that movie being anything short  of amazing. Yea, they could have cast Valerian a little better, but the movie is just pure space eye candy fun. &&[I loved that part where Tron snaps out of his conditioning as Rinzler and goes back to his old self.](https://youtu.be/DkTb7Pe2MtY)&&Tron lives&&Sam...you’re really messing with my zen thing here, man.&&[This](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/tron-flynn-lives-circuit-board/) is one of my absolute favorite pieces of wall art.  It's a REAL circuit board with Flynn's face in it and ""Flynn Lives"" as well.  It's available in classic 80s green circuit board and badass Tron legacy black.  It's so ingenious and like 30 bucks. &&Best ARG I've ever done. Everything about it was executed perfectly.&&[deleted]&&Not just him.&&Best track on the soundtrack/score.&&The game has changed&&I watched it and was sad that it never continued or concluded.&&I love Tron Uprising. It was so good, and I wish it was continued. I also really liked the animation style. &&Great animation. Reminds me a lot of Batman Beyond. &&Ducati Sport Classic... amazing bike.

Daft Punk knocked it out of the park with the soundtrack.&&There’s something I find about that pasty white one I find really sexy. &&I got chills.&&I just want another Tron movie soon.&&Worked for IT.&&And the original was disqualified for “using computers.” Lame.&&*The grid...*&&This movie has made separate ways my go to drunken karaoke song. You can tell I've hit the point of no return when I start playing that. &&As a fan of *Star Wars: The Clone Wars,* I wanted to stop by and say hi.&&Are you referring to the cartoon that was never renewed and thus never giving me my closure?&&Thats just it, like the original, it *does* have ""cult"" traction. But thats the issue, its *real* cult-traction. It has a small but very fervent core of people it appeals to. Not this new hollywood idea that tries to appropriate the ""cult classic"" title for their mainstream movies designed to appeal to mainstream masses.&&The way I heard it, they were all set to start production on the sequel and then the Marvel transaction closed. Disney decided to put all their resources into cranking out Marvel movies instead and pulled the plug at the last minute, leaving actors and production staff pissed. The script was allegedly, in part, a Quora fish-out-of-water story. &&Tomorrowland was a tragic letdown.&&Ah, Tron will be back.  Execs can't help but reuse old titles.

Imagine there's another 20 year skip, and we see an older Quorra living in the real world.  Or maybe Sam and Quorra have a child, and he or she finds that she needs to return to the grid.

I mean, a fish-out-of-water story about Quorra is an interesting idea and Olivia Wilde is pretty to look at and all, but really the story could be a lot more meaningful than just that.
&&>finally realized he cannot write and hasn't done much since.

I see somebody hasn't watched the Leftovers. That show was superb. He redeemed himself for me.&&He co created Lost and The Leftovers which are two of the most critically acclaimed shows ever, so it’s hard to believe he’s as bad as you say.

Never got the visceral hatred this guy gets on the Internet. He’s done some bad stuff and some great stuff.

Like most good writers.&&> The good news is that Damon Lindelof finally realized he cannot write and hasn't done much since.

Except showrunning [the Watchmen pilot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7049682/) HBO ordered a few months ago. ^womp ^womp&&In an interview with damon that I saw regarding Prometheus. He was very aware he was not especially talented. 

In his own words he was very lucky to have collaborated with many amazing people as he came up. 

When Disney put the pressure on him to perform without that collaboration his efforts came up short. 

True shame about Tron though. I loved that movie. &&Considering the topic, it's a bit like throwing stones in glass houses. Tron: Legacy has great production but about the most forgettable and boring writing around. I know this goes against the vibe of the thread but it's not that controversial. The movie wasn't well-liked.&&Thank you for that.&&Sorry to hijack your comment, but any ideas on where I can stream Tron Legacy?&&Thank you for your contribution. &&It's one of my favorite movies of all time and many would agree with me. I watch the credits of every movie I watch because of people like you.

Thank you for your hard work.&&I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere yet, so i'll just throw it here. There is actually a whole ""genre"" with kinda the same feel in music and visuals called Synthwave/retrowave/outrun. Try heading over to /r/outrun and check it out.
&&I’ve read speculation, even a reboot was mentioned. At this point, I don’t know of anything official. &&I dunno it actually felt really well done, not just talking about visuals and music&&I felt that way about The Rocketeer as well, which was a film I loved as a kid. Still like him now, but there is a little bit of cheese upon rewatching.&&The part I feel Clu looks most real is the scene where they go into Flynn’s place and they’re on the lift. The light shining underneath him looks great.&&That sounds exciting. Glad to see Disney still recognizing the franchise.&&Sorted by controversial to find a comment like this. You're absolutely right and there's nothing wrong with constructive criticism. &&I think he just wanted to show off. Most people who post art don’t actually want critique and will down vote criticism. I agree with all your points though. There’s a lot that is technically wrong (the oddly shaped tiny head for one). 

In an artist myself and am a perfectionist so it really bothers me to see proportional errors. &&Thank you for saying this, and articulating what I wanted to. I was shocked to see this at the top of r/movies.&&It's objectively bad. No idea how it's getting so much praise. Very confused right now&&I think films like that are *perfect* choices for sequels. Films where the world is so vibrant and full of potential, but it feels like the movies have barely scratched the surface.&&This is my first Tron piece but I do have one more black canvas, so I may do one more.&&Thank you.&&/r/outrun &&Nice! You do some great stuff. &&[China already got one.](https://youtu.be/taeucixxrdM) &&At least you’re alive.&&Aw, thanks!&&And Florida's Magic Kingdom is in the beginning stages of construction for their copy.&&Yeah and it's amazing. The ride itself is really quick though, maybe about 20 seconds once it actually starts moving. &&My game developer friend worked on that ride when he was living in Japan! He had frequent business trips to Shanghai until they finished it.&&That's fuckin' DOPE&&Took a ride on this just a few days ago. It's the best theme park ride I've ever been on, by far! The attention to detail in setting the visual and audio theme is unbelievable.. &&holy shit&&Dude why is the original Disneyland not have this or the way better version of Pirates of the Caribbean?!? &&In California Adventure? Actually I enjoyed the Mad T Party that replaced it, it had a neat psychedelic punk-rock vibe. It's a Guardians of the Galaxy-themed dance party right now because of the Mission: Breakout ride, though.

I think a lot of the Tron merch is in Tomorrowland instead, though I'm not sure (probably engulfed in a sea of Star Wars merch, plus I haven't been in a while). Pretty sure I remember a handful of Tron stuff being sold somewhere.&&This frisbee players were awesome and scary. I was always scared that one of those frisbee were gonna hit me. &&Oh man. And Flynn's Arcade? The spot where Tron would've been was Mario. It was the only time I've played the original Mario in an arcade. Arcades had SNES and Genesis games when I was frequenting them.&&That's one scene that really stood out to me. The helmets they wore for the movie are also my favorite Daft Punk helms!&&[Derezzed] (https://youtu.be/F4eccPBFEjE)&&END OF THE LINE CLUB AWWW YISSS&&Apparently, they are never doing a sound track for Disney again because all of what you hear from the Tron Legacy ST is what Disney did to it after Daft Punk was done with it. They completely changed it and didn't tell them.

Edit: someone informed me that I was incorrect. Sorry, but the soundtrack is all there's and it was a ""Reconfigured"" sound track that Disney did to upset Daft Punk.&&The director of Tron: Legacy also did Oblivion and used a lot of the same style he did for Tron in that movie. The mixing of visuals and the original soundtrack by M83 is actually really delightful. 

If your up for a similar kind of experience I highly recommend it. The plot isn't amazing, but the action sequences with the visuals and soundtrack really make up for it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822P87a773c&&For me it’s my “getting home drunk let’s quote all the lines before they delivers them”-movie. Oh and top 10 ever.&&Chill? You should watch it on acid&&I really hope it's re-released in 3D again sometime. It was up there with Avatar for the best 3D movie experience.&&Do it. I'd watch it&&I'm sorry did you say iPod?&&[deleted]&&This was the background on my computer for so long after the movie came out. &&I thought the story was very well done. It doesn't have a lot of dialogue depth, but then it wasn't trying to. It was going for mood and atmosphere and I think it nailed both of those. 

My favorite scene is the End of the Line Club fight sequence - and then right at the end of the fight when the bass on Daft Punk starts shaking the floor as Kevin Flynn arrives. So good...&&> movies about the search for perfection, Godhood, and existence

Someone that understands, in my opinion the movie was a masterpiece at all levels.&&I mean I'm still a huge fan of [Interstella 5555](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_Story_of_the_Secret_Star_System), but the visuals of Tron are hard to beat! &&""Because I bumped into him and all I had on me was this Samurai sword and you're not gonna not get Randy Jackson's autograph, right?""

""I would have done the same thing.""&&I don get it...&&biodigital jass, man&&False. If you think you enjoy something that most people don't, you are wrong and need to correct your opinion.&&I remember reading some reviews like “CGI was great, if only they put more effort into meaningful characters” which just threw me off. I felt like all the characters were great. A son just wanting his father back, a file that wants to see the sun, and a virus that feels limited in the world he occupies. It was Campbell in a computer, and it emotionally resonated with me&&I love it too, but it was lukewarm to me when I first saw it in theatres. I just walked out feeling meh about the story. I think the pacing/plot/editing had enough areas of discombobulation (more in the last act) to rob just enough from the punch of the amazing (and since then highly influential) design, music, visuals, etc. So the punch didn't quite connect full-on. 

But that just made it highly rewatchable because expectations are then properly calibrated. And the section where (after thousands of cycles of stalemate) Sam leaves his father's hideout, which shifts the balance, causing a thousand cycles of pent up forces to start rapidly cascading into an avalanche that completely changes everything... That's an amazing 20 minutes!

Like holy shit 90% of that movie's production team just knocked it out of the park, but it (initially) didn't resonate with me because of weakness in a just a few aspects. I'm guessing the rewrites just didn't gel together as well as they normally do or something like that.

I hope they do a sequel soon - it would be nice to have the same characters without them being ten+ years older...&&I got exactly what I was expecting. I feel like the people who hated it never even saw the original.&&Yeah, it's a moving experiance to me; people don't think movies can be emotional without deep story, but the atmosphere alone got me in the zone.&&I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but I understand why a lot of people didn't. I do agree with you entirely with the exception to hooking up The Grid to the internet. The idea that it's an AI stew that can just randomly generate consciousness and allow it to flourish in a walled garden makes the world that much more special.

Just my 2 cents.&&Speed racer is great.&&Agreed, apart from a stretched out plot in the second half and some pacing issues, it's rather perfectly done. Some of the fights could have been choreographed better (like the Derezzed club scene) but the action is pretty cool. &&[deleted]&&Biodigital jazz.&&Thats just your opinion miaan&&its been soooo song since ive seen references to this film.... 20 years man&&I really really hope Tron 3 comes out&&I've actually looked into that, because it's surprisingly well done. The consensus is that it was on Disney in mid-afternoon when no kids were around to watch it, and it wasn't really geared towards kids anyways. If they'd colored up the script a bit and put it on adult swim or something it might have done better&&Is it worth watching considering it never delivered your closure?&&I also really enjoyed it. I dont get why it gets so much hate. I loved the style and the music (and the Daft Punk cameo)!


Another stylized movie I love but everyone seems to hate is Sucker Punch. I know Zack Snyder is disliked by many especially after all the awful DC movies but I enjoyed Sucker Punch for the eye candy that it was. Loved all the action sequences and the different styles of each world.&&The movie failed?&&I love all of them. &&That's expected. Strong posture, good skin complexion, and defined jawline are all features of people who are generally found attractive. It's as if signs of a healthy running program are designed into us by a higher power. A user perhaps.&&They're multiplying &&28 years is soon on some time scales.&&A digital frontier.&&You can take your official release DVDs and just keep walking buddy.&&Sorry -- it was just a lame joke about the original *Tron*.&&I know right? I thought it was really good and was super pissed that there wasn't a season 2.&&The cliffhanger ending of uprising still upsets me so bad. &&I really enjoyed that cartoon :D&&I was SO HYPED for that. What a boring, paint-by-numbers movie it was.&&I actually like Tomorrowland. Then again, I really wasn't expecting anything from it.&&Disney is talking about a complete reboot - probably soon - and Jared Leto is excited to star in/produce it. It would likely scrap the current story which would completely bum me out.&&I would like to see their take on the internet with the Grid and all that. Maybe a shared space instead of a personal grid. In the first one MC did use the internet to access the pentagon and missile silos and stuff. But it was just a military network at that point. It'd be nice to see Flynn's legacy on the internet in that world. Maybe the lines between digital and real are blurred so you get more digital stuff in the real world. Like you'd be driving down the road and pass a bunch of normal buildings then suddenly there's this oasis of digital, neon grid stuff. People are becoming part ISO and can edit their code and stuff. Lots of possibilities for a sequel. &&Quorra and Sam have to return to the grid. Sam has figured out a way to bring the ISOs back by changing something in the outside world, but it also brings back Clu in the process. &&That show was just amazing in every way, even if the ending disappointed people looking for a certain type of ending.&&Was looking for this, however, The Leftovers is like his only shiny star.&&I have it on Blu-ray downstairs&&It was on Netflix last time I checked.&&I think it's confirmed in development but at the very early stages.   They're using some ideas from the original sequel plans but rebooting it essentially.&&I’d love to see another Tron film, but Disney has two cash cows with Marvel and Star Wars...&&Or we just really love Tron.&&Thank you very much! I wish I had more time to do this stuff. Video has taken up all of my free time.&&I know and it looks pretty cool.&&Heck yeah!&&Was literally just there three days ago, where is construction supposedly taking place?&&Disneyland has much more significant space constraints than any of the other parks.&&Interesting - when I was there a couple years back, it was basically a kiddie Alice themed rave.&&[Solar Sailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRvVyMuWbpM) is a particular favourite of mine from the soundtrack.  The subtle strings building up below the synths like waves, surging up and down, give this song so much texture and atmosphere; as if the orchestral side of the soundtrack represented the humans while the synthetic side of it represented the artificial, or maybe that the synth were the programming while the orchestra was the soul, building up below and pouring in at the seams.  It's not a catchy or complex melody by any means, but in terms of theming and subtlety, there's a lot going on under the hood.

God I wish there was another movie just to get them to make another soundtrack.&&[I always liked this son of Flynn remix](https://youtu.be/PLUaqKJ0I1E)&&MVP right here. Thanks&&Rerrezed

FTFY&&I may be wrong but I think the movie soundtrack is all Daft Punk, I was under the impression that they were mad that Disney released the second album Tron: Legacy Reconfigured. They had other djs edit Daft Punks music without their permission.&&Didn't know that. Any way to find the original pre Disney version?&&That’s shitty and all but the soundtrack reeeeally good so I’m not too upset about it.&&I'm tired of hearing this BS.  Soundtrack is more or less how Daft Punk intended.
-Joseph Trapanese&&I loved Tron Legacy and loved Oblivion. Oblivion is an under appreciated movie.  Both movies are wonderful to look at and to listen to. &&> The director of Tron: Legacy also did Oblivion

I did not that. Oblivion had a very cool visual style and a good mix between nature and technology.&&I wish Kosinski had more sci-fi in the works, I thought Tron:Legacy and Oblivion were stunning.  I feel like if he were to find that sweet spot where you balance plot and visuals he could direct a film that would be a sci-if classic.&&Digital Domain was the main vfx studio for that one.  &&That's high praise&&Watched it for my come up movie in Blu-ray with a sound bar on.

Best thing I've read all week

&&It was hard for me to explain to my film snob friends why I loved this movie so much and this thread has done it for me.&&Eh, somewhat. It's been awhile since I saw it, but IIRC, Rinzler stopped fighting at that point because CLU stopped him, not necessarily because he held back. Rinzler was in the lightcycle arena as well so not sure why you say differently. Tron was basically brainwashed by CLU just like he was doing to the other programs.&&He sent Tron after Sam when Qora came and was breaking Sam out&&Man!&&Me too&&That's only part of the story. In truth they actually moved it around the schedule multiple times, without notice or promotion, eventually placing it at 1 a.m. on Mondays. Knowing that, I don't think it's any surprise it cratered. I'm still horribly sad it did though, and it still stands as one of my favorite shows.&&Yes very much so&&I don't understand the idea that every movie has to be a cinematic masterpiece. A friend of mine calls books that aren't good but are just fun to read ""Brain Chocolate"". Movies like Sucker Punch are in the exact same vein. They're just so damn fun to watch and visually interesting. So, Eye Chocolate?&&Not financially ($400m box office),  but it definitely got a really bad rep that drove the creators from pursuing it further. &&I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer &&Ah. Haha. Sorry, I’m still sour about Tron Uprising’s fate.&&The first trailer was one of the best I've seen&&Me too.  I didn’t love it, but I enjoyed it.&&I would be *really* sad, annoyed, and angry if they scrap the current story.  I want to see Cillian Murphy finally be allowed to deliver the great upcoming potential villain that Legacy promised us.

Oh, and another Daft Punk/Joseph Trapanese soundtrack. Pls Disney&&I was excited until I heard Jared Leto. He was tolerable until Suicide. Now I cannot stand him. He is the epitome of the word 'poseur'.&&After hating Leto’s performances in Suicide Squad and Blade Runner 2049, I don’t want him ruining one of my favorite franchises. Bring back Quorra and Sam. I hate when they leave stories unfinished because they wanted to reboot a new actor. &&We're people disappointed? I thought it was one of the best series finales ever.&&Lost is still goddamn amazing and he wrote most of the best episodes of that show.&&It’s not anymore&&If it's the reboot with Jared Leto, I couldn't be less interested. I have Leto-fatigue. 

I want to see what happens with Sam, Quorra, and, of course, it would be great to have Kevin Flynn/Jeff Bridges back.&&[Permits were filed](http://www.wdwmagic.com/attractions/tron/news/05dec2017-photo---recently-filed-permits-show-the-precise-location-of-the-tron-coaster-and-new-main-street-theater.htm) and made public as of December 5th. It included both the Tron Coaster, located north of Space Mountain, and the Main Street Theater, located on the Main Street bypass. Construction is in the VERY preliminary stages, as Disney is known to construct things very slowly. Photos have been taken of surveyors at the location, as well as other evidence of basic commencement.&&Planed Opening in 2021 (for the 50 year ani).  Will be in a new area next to Space Mountain. &&Dont hold your breath. The film didnt meet disneys expectations and they pissed off Daft Punk by releasing a remix album without Punks blessing. So even if we get another Tron (unlikely), it probably wont have a score by daft punk.  
  
However, there where rumours that Deadmaus was in consuderations for the soundtrack for Legacy, and given his incredible growth since I think he can do a great score.&&Yes you're right, it was the *remix album* that Disney did without Daft Punk's permission. And DP was pissed understandably, but I'd argue that's not nearly as bad as what the other ~~above highly upvoted~~ comments are claiming happened (Disney just making their own music/heavily modifying DP's music for the actual movie soundtrack, w/out their permission, and then saying it was ""made by Daft Punk""?)

I mean it's possible I'm wrong, but in that case could someone provide a source saying otherwise?&&This is the real story.&&Interestingly [this](https://youtu.be/FrBWPAGcrDs) came out some time after the demo trailer and was believed to be a leaked part of the daft punk soundtrack. Nobody knew who the confirmed artist was - until a few months later it was ""revealed"" to be crydaluv. A producer of house music who evidently highly appreciated daft punk, (crydaluv is a homage to crydamoure, the independent label for guy and Thomas's side projects).

It generated a lot of hype - as most fans who heard this believed it really was daft punk's leaked soundtrack. It was also what fans expected of the tron soundtrack. I don't think I'm alone in thinking that the end result was not what was expected after this. 

I'm getting tin foily here but the song is quite unlike anything crydaluv has made, and makes me suspect it was daft punk's real work before Disney fucked with it. But who knows.&&I don't think it's possible to hear it. Disney took what they did per contract and then changed it. So I'm assuming all their work was gone.&&Somebody dig this up. They will be handsomely rewarded. &&I worked in an IMAX theater when Oblivion came out, and it was AWESOME on the dome because instead of having a camera jerking and spazzing around during action sequences, a lot of the time they kept the camera stationary. This made it a lot more immersive to watch on the dome because it kept the scenery steady and allowed you to follow the action around yourself.&&While i loved the concept of Oblivion ... i just can't get past Tom Cruise, if anyone else had been cast. He has too much baggage as an actor as a Scientology cult member and promoter and willing participant of their evils they have inflicted on the whole world.&&Watch speed racer next time after like 2 hours though, have it be hitting hard from the start&&But in this movie she looks amazing and the movie doesn't suck.&&It's my specialty ;)&&LIKE KOBAYASHI!&&MICHAEL!&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&The term is “Eye Candy”, Billy and the clone-a-saurus.&&And here I am waiting for the sequel &&What did they look like? &&I miss that cartoon. I watched it every Saturday morning. I will rewatch every episode because of this post.&&They end TRON uprising *at the uprising *&&You should read Tron: Betrayal. Really well done graphic novel about the lease up to Legacy. &&Likewise -- I was 100% in just off that 30 second spot. It oozed mystery and wonder. And then...&&Daft Punk won't come back. They had a falling out with Disney after the soundtrack remix album. Disney didn't even consult them about it and it upset them. Which is why they haven't done a soundtrack since.&&In my eyes, Villeneuve redeemed him in Blade Runner. He was utilised really well. &&Check out [canistream.it](http://canistream.it)! &&[deleted]&&Honestly Giorgio Moroder would be a nice fit too.  (He made music for the games).

I also think Kavinsky would be nice to have on the soundtrack.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&It was the remix album but it wasn't Daft Punk who was pissed. It was their ex-manager. &&Here’s a link I found about the beef over the remix album.

www.nme.com/news/music/daft-punk-129-1291969&&For all the hate the Reconfigured album gets, the Crystal Method remix wasn't too bad. Maybe because they didn't fuck around too much with the original, unlike some others who rendered some tracks pretty unrecognisable.&&Oh that version is cool. I like how dry and sparse it is. The drums have more meat too, like edited real drums instead of the drumsynth kinda sound. The dry tightness reminds me of Homework, a real cool vibe. But that's also what makes me think it's somebody else trying to do the Daft Punk sound.

Regardless, I can't find a source that Disney meddled with the score enough to anger Daft Punk. There is one that the manager was mad about the remix album though. &&Interesting that you mentioned this. Way back when before this movie even came out, I found a “leaked” version of the soundtrack on a torrent site. 

All but a few of the songs were slightly different than the ones that came out on the OSD for Tron. I wonder if that was the originals pre-Disney.  &&That sucks.&&Actually, you are mistaken. The movie soundtrack is all theirs. They were upset about the remix album that came out, not the movie soundtrack. If you're unsure, try to do a lil more research next time. Seems like most of the people in this comment thread are taking your comment as truth, which is unfortunate. [Check the Wikipedia article for the remix album.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron%3A_Legacy_Reconfigured?wprov=sfla1) ""Daft Punk's former manager Pedro Winter was displeased with Tron: Legacy Reconfigured and asserted that the duo was not involved with the remix album. He wrote in an open letter to Disney that, ""Of course some of it is nice, and you know there are some of my friends on this CD. But this is not enough! [...] I am sad to discover the A&R at Disney records is apparently buying most of his electronic music in airports stores...""""&&What did you think of Edge of Tomorrow?

Still hung up on it just being Tom Cruise? I can understand that. I just try to look past personal feelings regarding the matter and enjoy the fact that he seems to do a great job at sci-fi action movies.&&You could just as easily be describing the Catholic Church but I get your point. To each their own but I have yet to be disappointed in a Tom Cruise performance even if the movie it was in was subpar. And everyone he works with describes him as a pleasure to work with. I just don’t understand the hate. &&POW!&&Oh that's funny, MICHAEL!&&Yeah he was basically a brainwashed attack dog up until he snapped out. &&>asked for further instruction.

Right, that's not him fighting for the user, that's him asking for what to do from CLU. 

On the other part, all that really means is he didn't have him in the game. He still sent him down after Sam in the lightcycle arena though.

You could say Rinzler showed hesitation around the user, sure, but it wasn't until the lightglider scene that he actually fought for the user again.&&CLU wanted to kill Sam in front of all the programs. Any program who rebelled against CLU died so any program thanking CLU should be taken with a grain of salt.&&##metoo&&Ships? Motorcycles?&&I've got a 14 hour plane flight Thursday and I've already started downloading the episodes (legally, through Amazon prime).&&As a season finale: good.

As a series finale: what the fuck? &&Ok, so don't get Daft Punk, get The Glitch Mob, for example.&&Remixes are essentially covers and honestly they don’t really HAVE to consult them. It’s usually just a polite formality. &&This makes me sad because I remember this being the sole thing I bought on iTunes when I was younger, since I haven’t really bought much digital music over the years, and Derezzed still sits in my workout/study playlists

Oh well; I just hope they do another album before RAM is a decade old haha&&I agree, but I'd rather Tron take the Star Wars approach and use no name actors.&&I dont even get the appeal for Leto? Just feels like a scarlet Johansson situation.  Some marketability group somewhere said she would sell, so people started using her, so eventually everyone just kept using her because they were afraid to be the studio *not* using her for their big movie.

It was so tiring for so long. And i see even less appeal in Leto.&&Totally agree!  I really liked the original cast and the story.  &&A Kavinsky Tron album would be unreal&&Oh god, get a bunch of guys like Kavinsky and Timecop for the soundtrack, with Dance with the dead and Carpenter brut for fight scenes. That would be my perfect movie.&&Because they're Disney?&&So there's still hope (If a sequel ever fucking happens)!&&That's for the source! And to u/SirTrike for pointing out it was the manager and not Daft Punk themselves who were angry.

Ironically, I absolutely love that remix album and listen to it more than the original soundtrack.&&PSA: Adfest the likes even God has not seen. Do *not* visit without a blocker (or six) installed.&&Do you still have it? If you do you gotta post it &&It’s possible. Back in the olden days, when Queen of the Damned  came out and I found out that there was some sort of contractual problem with Jonathan Davis’s (of Korn) voice being in the actual sound track, I started digging to find the audio. I found it! Some of it was meh quality, some of it obviously had a layer of some dude talking through it to deter the sample from being pirated, and some was just cut from the movie audio. &&I'll have to check my tracks because i ""might"" have downloaded that version.

Edit: I'll have an answer to this question in a few hours.  I'm at work right now and can't access my pc. &&I honestly have a pretty vivid memory of this as well, hearing the songs but sounded like a beta-version of the ST versions. &&Edge of Tomorrow is a great movie and I'm glad it was renamed to something that actually makes sense (Live Die Repeat). Also glad they're making a sequel (Live Die Repeat and Repeat).

As far as Tom Cruise's personal life goes, I don't give a flying fuck. Lots of Hollywood types have skeletons in their closets and stuff shoved under the rug. I'd rather watch a good movie than bitch about someone's personal beliefs. Scientology sucks big time but they won't stop me from enjoying my hobby.&&Also Tom Cruise is one of the few big actors that deals in sci-fi.&&The hate against Tom Cruise is pretty much virtue signaling against Scientology. People are right to despise the ~~religion~~ cult but they go about it in an ineffective way. Not watching a movie isn't going to do anything to hurt the cult since they get Cruise's huge checks no matter what. By all means, people are entitled to watch movies based on whatever criteria they decide. I will say that by avoiding his movies (especially the sci-fi ones) you're missing out on really good stuff.

Cruise is a professional that does great work so I generally enjoy the movies he's in.&&Identity theft is not funny Jim!&&[deleted]&&Do the circuits look like freeways?&&Lucky&&It's me. I'm back. &&The guys from S U R V I V E who do the Stranger Things soundtracks would also be good I feel. &&They just wanted the formality was all.&&Except Jeff Bridges&&The difference is that Scarlett Johansson doesn't annoy me.&&Throw in waveshaper and Dan Terminus for added effect- also you may want to check out a documentary in production called rise of the synths and their soundtrack&&No problem! I enjoy the remix as well, a lot of pretty big DJs contributed. Disney should have just asked though, maybe they just thought they had 🔥. Had to get those mixtapes out.

Night time laser battles, tracked Hunter Killer tanks, a real clash with the legions of SkyNet on a battlefied of fucking human skulls, etc. Fans of the franchise wanted, and were hoping for, a full length movie of the opening sequences of the first three Terminator movies.

I'm not saying its right, but when you pump these actors with HGH and Test, train them for 2-3 hours a day, carb deplete, dehydrate,  and restrict their calories to get them down to sub 7% bodyfat, then have them work on set for XX number of hours ... they can get a little preturbed.  Once again I'm not saying its right or acceptable, but very few people would be acting differently in that situation after the first month or so of filming.  

Edit: And for anyone trying to kid themselves, you don't go from ""The Machinist"" to ""Batman Begins""  in 6 months (estimated 100lb difference) without taking a cocktail of steroids that would scare most Russian Olympians.  https://cdn.stronglifts.com/wp-content/uploads/christian-bale-batman.jpg Any man at his age, not on gear, would be extremely lucky to synthesise 2 lbs of lean muscle tissue a month, and even then, would still require a month or two of cutting the fat that was put on during the massing phase.  

So yeah ... everyone on that set should have signed an NDA and gotten a 25% pay increase for the period of time when the extrememly talented, oscar winning, method actor is even more of a moody bitch than usual.  That's movie magic folks.  Les Grossman is my spirit animal.

#$&&I don't think he was very good in it at all. He just bitched a lot and ran around. It's not all his fault, it was really junk writing. I own the movie like I own all of them. It's like little pieces of each of the sequels gives us a tiny something that Cameron never did. That's apparently about to change in 2019 though.    

One thing, Salvation nailed the look and aesthetic. Terminators looked really good. Just no soul here. T2 Shined.&&I am glad he eventually changed his mind and accepted the role. Christian Bale in Terminator Salvation kinda reminds me of Ewan McGregor in the Star Wars prequel.

There was never anything special about the original John Connor, the machines were losing because of the hope and will of mankind, not because of some genius commander.

I really wish they had gone with that instead of changing the plot.  It would have been a much better movie, IMO.

Edit:  Oh wow!  My first gilded comment, thanks so much!&&The original ending was John Conner is killed and Skynet faceswaps it onto Marcus and is rescued by Kyle Reese. Marcus wakes up and sees his face  knowing if he tells the Truth, they will lose heart, and decides to become John Conner. Skynet either wins with their preprogrammed Mole, or everything they do to stop John Conner creates the perfect John Conner.&&Think Westworld meets Terminator. &&Nolan was originally attached to Salvation?&&Man this movie would have actually been good if Nolan had stayed on board.  Those brothers are talents af.&&>“I said no three times. I thought that the franchise…I went ‘Nah, there’s no story there,’” Bale said. “There’s a perverse side to me, where people were telling me that, there’s no way on God’s Earth that I should take that role, and I was thinking the same thing. But when people started verbalizing that to me, I started to go, ‘Oh really? All right, well watch this then.’ So there was a little bit of that involved in the choice.”

>Bale said “Salvation” ended up being hurt by “an unfortunate series of events,” including both the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike and the departure of Jonathan Nolan. The screenwriter started working on the script, which Bale called a “wonderful” version, but had to abruptly leave the project because of a proper commitment.

>“It’s a great thorn in my side, because I wish we could have reinvigorated [the franchise],” Bale said. “And unfortunately, during production, you could tell that wasn’t happening. It’s a great shame.”

#edit

*sigh*

>As for the temper tantrum heard around the world, Bale once again admitted to regretting his behavior on set and calling it a valuable learning lesson. Footage of Bale screaming at cinematographer Shane Hurlburt for walking into a shot during one take went viral in 2009.

>“That was a very unusual occasion. Great learning lesson for me,” Bale said. “No matter how much you lose yourself in a scene, you do not allow yourself to behave that way. And yeah, of course I’ve got enormous regrets about it.”

>Bale is currently in theaters as the star of Scott Cooper’s “Hostiles.&&""ey Christian, we got these cheeseburgers man...""&&""Just tell tell me what you want me to fuuuuuuuuck &&[deleted]&&I started watching Episodes last night.

I liked in more than 3, and it’s certainly better than anything that has come since. It had some really good scenes and I even liked the idea that they’d created a terminator that didn’t know he wasn’t human. &&I *really* liked the movie. I don't remember why I did so much but it's still the only movie I've ever wanted to watch a second time immediately after. I have been waiting years to forget the plot of the movie and now I'm excited to experience it again&&THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!!&&Apparently the original ending had Worthington's terminator shed it's skin and replace it with Connor's - who had died. Would've been this great dramatic irony that part of the reason he was such a legendary badass was because he was really a terminator the whole time. Amazing eh. 

But no, I'm unsure if it was test screens or the producers put a stop to the main character dying and basically having his skin being worn. &&Yessss!!! All I kept thinking throughout the movie is where is that awesome apocalyptic Machine ridden skull ridden future that they showed us in the first and second one, I honestly believe the future imagined in the first and second one was much better than what they showed us. THE effects themselves for the time we're pretty awesome so I can only imagine what they could have done with the newer technology in today's age.  But no. Very disappointing&&And a nuclear explosion. And Alice in Chains “Rooster.” And loads of robots beating the shit out of people. And a submarine blowing up. Dude that movie was fucking rad. I don’t get why people hate it.&&Some of the awesome laser stuff was brought back at the beginning of Genisys. But, unfortunately, the rest of the movie was abysmal&&It was supposed to be the first in a series of Future War movies that would have shown those things getting progressively scarier as the films went on.

The most recent Terminator films are developing a habit of planning for trilogies instead of making solid standalone films.&&Seriously why were they still using guns that have been proven useless against the terminator robots? I have the same complaint against the second Transformers movie in there were a bunch of soldiers trying to kill Deceptacons with M4s&&As soon as I saw the title of this thread I looked for a comment like this. I’m so satisfied.&&I mean, what was he wearing?&&Looks like Hollywood needs to learn that ""*No means no*"" in more ways than one.&&what was he wearing? lets go through every social media post hes ever posted. he's starred in movies before. he probably wanted to star in movies again&&He's crazy and difficult to work with from what I hear.&&He was totally asking for it with that outfit.

I mean who among us *wouldnt* want to cast Bale in Terminator Salvation?

And look, I know that now it’s obviously not appropriate to ask actors to be in terminator movies, but back in the ots and even in the early 20 teens, who can blame a producer to try to attach Christian Bale to the Terminator franchise? It was Hollywood culture at the time!&&Hell yea. The music really is what made it epic though. NIN is really fitting to trailers.

Another EPIC trailer with NIN music is 300, amazing!

Salvation was a good movie, but it doesn't feel like a terminator movie.

Genisys was a bad movie.&&I honestly like it a decent amount. It has its flaws, but it's better by leaps and bounds compared to genysis or rise of the machines.&&For me it was the fact that T3 was such a shit show, yet salvation (a movie that is honestly mediocre at worst) gets all the shit.

And everything after that has been shaking the corpse to see if more change would fall out.&&tbh I just wanted to see a young naked Arnold again, even if it was just CGI. &&I saw Salvation in the cinema when I was in the middle of a two week bout of insomnia. In the opening scene, Sam Worthington kisses the cancer lady and says ""so I guess that's what death tastes like"".

That was so silly that I had to turn to my friend next to me and confirm that it had actually just happened and it wasn't a sleep deprived hallucination (which I did have when I got home and saw maggots by my washing machine).

I don't remember much but I do recall feeling like Salvation was just a bit pointless. It didn't add anything to the existing canon. It's just sort of there.&&Went in with extremely low expectations for genesys... Actually ended up liking it.  But Christian bale added credibility to the project thereby upping expectations.

And that ending sucked.  Worthington should have put bales skin on himself and made John Connor live forever.  Would have been much better.&&It's a god damned masterpiece compared to everything else that came out after T2.&&Oh yeah Genysis seemed like an attempt to turn the franchise into a modern social media story... It's a different world, different timeline (the original movies)- there's no need to make it relatable to Facebook users of 2015 or whenever it came out, it's not even the right type of franchise for that to work.  Bringing back Arnold was pretty cool though.&&I remember the outrage when this came out but any time I've chatted  to someone about it, they don't blame Bale for reacting like that (I don't either). It may have been OTT but it was understandable.

Really, what are humans if not terminators?


Relentless, methodical predators that pursue prey to the point of exhaustion. Seems less *man vs machine* to me and more *man vs man.*&&Yeah but kind of destroys the plot of the two best Terminator movies that will ever be made. Why is Kyle Rease fighting so hard to save Sarah Conner if it doesn't matter?&&This gave me an idea, what if the resistance are actually rogue terminators that broke away from skynet and believed themselves to be human. Then later on it's revealed that humanity went extinct long ago.&&They did this in the latest terminator film.&&> It wasn't bad, but in the end everything goes through a focus group full of stupid people and most of the times that kills the best ideas.

example: I Am Legend&&And both ideas from the same writer, Jonathan Nolan.&&""I'm a machine? Noooooooooooooo. 


Oh well""&&Wow that could’ve been brilliant if played out. I also always thought Sams character was never fully realized. Like he’s a Robot but there’s never a, Oh that’s why, moment. &&Just like his brother, Jonathan knows how to manipulate time. WestWorld, Interstellar, and Memento prove my point.

I'm sure something great would've came out of his Terminator script. &&The same Jonathan Nolan that’s written a lot of Christopher’s films...&&Christopher Dolan&&Some corrections.. Jonathon wrote the first drafts of the Batman films based off treatments given to him by Goyer and Chris Nolan, after which Chris did a final spit and polish on the script. Jonathon wrote the short story that Memento was based on, but Chris wrote the script (the short story was set in a mental hospital and I recommend finding it as it’s a good read and serves as a cool prequel!) Jonathon Nolan adapted an existing script for Interstellar, and again Chris did the final rewrite. They both adapted the Prestige (the book of the script has a really fun Easter egg in the forewords for fans of this film who have read the novel of The Prestige by the way)

Source: I’m a film nerd, and a huge Nolan fan.&&Yeah after watching Westworld his Terminator would be amazing, no doubt.&&Yup, if his name is attached to a project I am going to be immediately interested. Probably as much so as if it were just his bro. I don't think Christopher Nolan would have the prominence he currently has if it wasn't for his brother. Those two make quite the pair. Might be the reason I wasn't as impressed with *Dunkirk*. Technically speaking it was a great movie, but it didn't have that cerebral and depth-of-character qualities that I think Jonathan usually has, and something that I tend to like a lot.&&Just saw their Wikipedia page... dang, they kinda suck.&&His agent is reported to have mentioned to Bale that he heard some guy say he couldn't do it.&&/r/firstworldanarchists &&/r/holdmyoscar&&Translation: But when people started adding zeroes to my paycheque, I started to go, ""Oh really?""&&So many great achievements have been fueled by spite.

It's when they get to the modern day that it starts getting really stupid.&&It's my third favorite Terminator movie. &&Imagine what it could have been if Jon Nolan hadn't bailed.&&Not a huge fan of Common and Worthington, they both play Common and Sam Worthington in every role. the film is not bad, but just filled with people and scenes that just feel like they don't belong there, I can't even put my finger on one huge problem, it's more like a bunch of small things that just don't gel at all.&&Genisys was a bad movie that gave away the bad plot to the bad movie before the bad movie was released.&&> Salvation was a good movie, but it doesn't feel like a terminator movie.

It built off of the only thing T3 did right: showing Judgment Day so that the series has to do something new and not remake T3.

Unfortunately, it pioneered one of the major things Genisys did wrong: it was made as a set-up movie for a trilogy that the studio promised they would complete, and then promptly cancelled as soon as the set-up movie performed like a set-up movie instead of like a standalone movie.&&Nailed it. &&Shrug, I kind of liked them all.  I just don't like Worthington in Salvation.  Even as a machine playing a man, he's too one dimensional.  At least Summer Glau, who also has a very limited range, played the one thing she does well really well during TSCC&&At least it didn't fuck with the canon like the newer movies.&&No, Kyle Reese should have died when the big robot arm grabbed him; never to be seen again.  Worthington should have gone back in time and **become** Kyle Reese.  BAM!  A Terminator is John Conner's father.  Skynet, through a time loop, had created it's own nemesis.  

My girlfriend came up with that.  I'm not that smart. &&He's done some things that showed he has temper issues, but I was convinced that he's a good guy in general when he visited the hospital in Denver on his own dime (and on the down low) to visit the shooting victims after the theater shootings.&&I mean, yeah, the DP kept tweaking the lights.

are there things that (some) people won't do even for the highest amount of money? yes.

but other than these very few exceptions, people would of course do pretty much ""anything"" for the right amount money - and I absolutely include myself in that.

Am I doing this right&&I'd accept Chuck-E-Cheese tokens.&&Wanna get weird and make a movie together?&&Similar to the title of *Aliens*. 

Xenomorphs are the natives of LV-426. It's the humans who are the aliens.&&You could argue that the first two movies still reinforced the hope / will to persevere. The robots were really just shooting themselves in the foot by creating the John Connor (J.C.) savior figure and the belief of the people that followed him by going back in time. Like, ""Whoa, robots went back in time to kill this guy which means we must have a chance.""&&Actually I think it wraps up its own hole. Kyle Reese went back to *make sure* that at least 1 John Connor comes to powers. The entire song and dance was to ensure that at least one person was ready and would be able to convince and rear a child to save humanity. Skynet sent the Terminator back to kill John Connor and Kyle Reese just picked it’s next target. She sees the Terminator and spends the rest of her life preparing for Armageddon. Plot motherfuckin’ twist &&Not necessarily.  The idea of John Connor had to start somewhere, otherwise why even use the name?  If Marcus takes John's place and starts the tradition of someone taking up that mantle, it's because John did something to become a symbol of hope that galvanizes the Resistance.  So, even if Skynet sends back a Terminator to take out the original John Connor believing it will remove the person currently using the moniker, Kyle Reese and the Resistance know the original needs to survive for that symbol to come into being.

It wouldn't diminish but put a new twist on the first two movies:  John Connor isn't being saved because he needs to live to fight for the future.  John Connor is being saved because he needs to *die* so others can fight for the future.&&Keeping the illusion that there is a single Connor and keeping the machines busy/distracted in order to win the war.&&He was the first John Connor.

I never read the book, but in the movie (written and directed by women) Bateman is the villain.

The world he lives in allows it because it's just as broken as he is. 

It's a satire. The whole point is that everything in the movie is the wrong way it aught to be. Patrick Bateman isn't someone to idolize, but to pity. Maybe the book is different, but protesting American Psycho seems like it would go against her own self-interest. &&...and thereby completely missed the point of the book.

There's few things worse than an ideologue who doesn't understand satire.&&If you've got the stomach for it? I must be desensitized as shit, because I don't find anything in that movie to even be remotely stomach churning.&&wrong Nolan brother.&&There Terminator should just open his mouth and emit modem noises.&&He wasn't a typical terminator, though. He was a cyborg *with a human brain*.

Doesn't matter for beans if that human brain has a computer interface to communicate via Skynet Wi-Fi - he wasn't just a cast-from-the-mold, cold-as-steel, programmed-to-terminate-the-human-race, ~~dyed-in-the-wool~~ painted-in-the-chassis machine. 

He was basically a person with some wicked prostheses. 

As far as the talking-head bit goes, here's my take on it:

Skynet knew that Marcus was not following his programming. The machine *knew* that Marcus wasn't following orders, and that he needed to be reprogrammed in order to be another soldier in Skynet's army. Thing was, Marcus was too unique to shutdown and reboot or scrap for parts and start over - he was a machine with human organs and a human mind; too complex to just start from scratch, and too complex to try conventional methods of reprogramming.

Skynet has the whole of human knowledge in its database, including psychology. If it was going to convince a man that he was a machine, communicating wirelessly wouldn't do the trick; his brain would reject the stimulus and Skynet would lose its shot at reprogramming. That's why Skynet was communicating the way it did - with a recognizable, familiar, *human* face on a computer screen instead of another terminator wearing Serena Kogan's skin, or a friendly android, or Kevin Spacey's character in *Moon*. That's why Skynet tried *so frigging hard* to convince Marcus that he wasn't what he thought he was (""What else could you be, if not machine?"" A computer is posing a rhetorical question to another computer? Nah, it's a computer posing a rhetorical question to a human being.) instead of ""turning him off and rebooting him.""&&It’s the whole make a fight look good for film issue. If you look at any boss fight in almost any film, the fights should almost always end instantly when you’re dealing with powerful characters. But they stretch them out cause the film is building up to it for 90 mins&&[deleted]&&No, as the resistance was storming the building and taking control. Sending back the first terminator was the last ditch, hail marry. 5 min later J. Conner was in the room sending Reese through. &&Send too many terminators and they might get too much attention causing skynet to not be allowed to exist &&They could only send one because they had limited resources since the humans were winning and SkyNet was getting desperate. Plus, their armies were made up of the Skeletons, so they didn't exactly have an abundance of Cyborg models and they thought one ""stealth"" model would be enough to pull off the job (and it easily would've if the resistance didn't send back Reese).&&It's my 7th favourite terminator movie &&Yeah, I'd agree.  It's not hard when your competition is T3 and Genesys.  I still think that the show was the best sequel to the first two movies.  &&> Jon Nolan

That was the very reason I was looking forward to it so much.

*PS. Best trailer ever too.&&> I can't even put my finger on one huge problem, 

Namely, that Terminator movies without James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger kind of suck?&&Like common taking the time to pose in his sunglasses as they get off the helicopter in the middle of a battle at night? &&And T2 was a good movie that gave away the good plot to the good movie before the good movie was released.&&Begs the question: Do terminators have robo nuts? They have real skin, blood, and hair... what about sperm? Could a lonely T800, weary from death and war, find comfort in the arms of a human woman? Could their love bear fruit? Does he truly love? Does he dream? Do *I* dream? Can I love? What am the sky? Daisy...daisy...&&That's good of him.

I remember hearing stories from 3:10 to Yuma about how Russell Crowe would ignore everyone and hide away in his trailer whereas Bale knew everyone in the crew by name and would walk around and chat with them all.&&That's awesome he did that. They used to play that sound byte of him yelling onset on the Howard stern show all the time. Admittedly it put a bad taste in my mouth about him but after reading this article and hearing him regret it, as well as finding out about him visiting that hospital, he seems like a stand up guy and that makes me happy. He definitely immerses himself in every role in a way few do these days. And at least he hasn't sexually assaulted anyone. (Fingers crossed!!!)&&Agreed. If some Asshole put an outburst of mine during a bad day at work online, I'd have been fired dozens of times by now.&&Not a shitty day or month. You don't move around in an actors line of sight while they are filming. That's like a huge no no on set. And they guy did it twice.&&That applies to Salvation and Genisys equally.  Both trailers gave away the whole movie and deflated my enthusiasm enough to make me just wait for the DVD release.&&Official Discussion: Aziz Ansari Accusations

Don’t know how that went over my head. Was thinking maybe it was a copypasta or something. Thanks &&There are a lot of cases of sexual assault in Hollywood that should be taken seriously. Problem is we simply cannot know which ones are full of shit and which aren’t because all we literally have are statements. 

For all we know half of all the accusations coming out are either lies or come from people that retroactively decided to retract the consent they gave. 

But then people cry “now the victims are forced to prove it, that’s unfair!” No that’s called due process. We can’t start ruining people’s lives based on words alone. There have already been some cases where the accused, whether legitimately or facetiously, is flabbergasted by accusations and says they’re flat out wrong. 

How do we know which is which? How do we know who to nail to the wall and who not to?&&Oh, shit, I whooshed.  I’ll leave up and enjoy my ignominy.&&No no NO!!!!.

She married Bale's father in 2000, when Bale was already 26 years old. I would perhaps not call her his ""step-mother"", more like ""his father's wife"".&&I prefer my second wave feminists to be store-brand.&&His father must've been a fucking madman.&&Probably for the same reason that people idolise the Joker, Travis Bickle, and Bateman. There is the subverse audience that despite the satire, still fall in love with these twisted characters and they become 'cultural icons'&&I believe it was protested mainly for its frequent and graphic depiction of sexual exploitation and violence towards women.&&The book is way more messed up.&&The book takes Bateman's lunacy much further. If you read the book, you'd never think of him as ""cool"", he's quite the opposite. Despite is outward appearance and way he presents himself to others, he's very unstable, paranoid, and emotionally fragile.

The business card scene in the movie portrays this perfectly... no one else in that room really gives much of a shit about those business cards, but in Bateman's mind it goes well beyond a simple dick measuring contest... its his whole world... he's got money, surrounded by elegant things and gorgeous women, his physique is perfect, but its never enough. He never feels in control or winning in the eternal contest in his head to be admired and loved. He never deals with his emotions and pretends he has none when really that's all he has and he's bound by it. So he's supremely jealous of others who seem to have everything under control. It's why he desires to kill and torture... when he's murdering someone, suddenly he's in control and he has all the power and prestige, but it doesn't last after they're dead and disposed of and once real life resumes he's back to struggling with his emotions again. &&Well some folks just changed the final act of Carmen (the opera by Bizet) and had Carmen *not* die to “take a stance against violence against women”.

I am still unsure how “my ex-lover killed me because I rejected him and he is a man that can't take no for an answer” is *not* advocating against violence.&&The book is the same, only you know that whole yuppie thing, where no once recognizes each other and everyone is interchangeable? In the book that's even worse. That made me way sicker than all the shocking murder etc. To exist, without even being a person. Now that's freaky.

Anyway, i find it funny how people commenting on your post are only questioning how people might perceive Bateman and now why Steinem is protesting. &&Because the book (and movie) show graphic violence against women. The book is much worse, honestly. It's written well but it's just so graphic in how he mutilates (and sometimes eats) women. 

Or maybe he didn't do it the whole time.

He definitely is the villain of the book. However, a lot of people cannot comprehend that you aren't glorifying something by making it the main character. It's the same reason why Huckle Berry Finn is often not allowed for children to read, because the character Jim has an *interesting* adjective describing him.&&Eh, given how much normal people don't understand satire, it's not that much a screw up.

People think the world of Starship Troopers the movie would be fun to live in. &&You can be opposed to things even if they make a point you ultimately support--satire has very little to do with it and accusing someone of being an ideologue that doesn't understand satire on that basis is a pretty good indication that *you* don't understand their point.

If you're opposed to violence on a fundamental level, you're not suddenly going to be onboard with A Clockwork Orange just because it's satire and ultimately isn't saying the violence it depicts is a good thing. Agreeing with the movie that XYZ is bad doesn't mean you have to be okay with the movie's depiction of it in the first place. Saying you have to be okay with it because you both agree on XYZ being bad suggests a really un-nuanced and uncritical worldview. It would be incredibly childish to respond to someone objecting to the movie's violence with ""you missed the point!""

It's missing the point in a big way to think that someone opposed to violence against women has to be okay with a movie where women are subjected to violence as long as the movie presents it as a bad thing. It just shows that you fundamentally don't understand what they are actually opposed to in the first place--same as people getting upset about the ""shithole"" comment this week. The vulgarity wasn't the issue and it would be just as bad a statement if worded perfectly politely.&&I mean, she's anti-pornography and the like. It's not like she didn't know that it was satire. She just opposed that type of imagery on principle, because she thought that it promoted violence against women just by being circulated. It's partially a desensitization argument, which kind of makes sense in her context.

This is the type of shit that brought the third wave around. There's a good reason why it basically started as an internal criticism of second wave feminism - a lot of their arguments aren't that great, and the anti-pornography ones aren't even the worst. The third wave did a pretty good job, tbf.&&You can still think that a satire is damaging when it depicts women as objects that can be harmed without consequence; especially when people don’t understand satire. The violence towards women can definitely be considered gratuitous when it is just a book criticising yuppies.&&So then, clearly you have the stomach for it. I do too, but I wouldn’t presume that everyone does. My gf can’t even do some eps of Black Mirror. &&That's legitimately terrifying.&&How hard would it be to just add a wireless chip to a Terminator?&&I think Marcus is an example of multiple technologies that Skynet acquired. 
His body was donated to science. He has a strong heart. He was a perfect match for a heart transplant, perhaps the research on his body was to make a body full of donor organs that are in great shape and that are antigen free and serve as universal donors. His artificial parts are from other experimental level prosthetics. 

Skynet might have a lot of bodies on ice and have a plethora of technology that they are trying out. &&I feel like a lot of classic movies do it right.  They have a long intense chase sequence.  There isn't a lot of fighting in the fist to fist sense, but rather, the bad guy never quiet gets their hands on the protagonist.  &&Well, there are ways to set up action scenes effectively or stretch them out in logical fashion. Establish that direct fights will be short and brutal, and then play with the resulting tension.

A lot of the modern action movies just seem kind of lazy; or at least very much stuck in their ways.&&>It’s the whole make a fight look good for film issue

Worked in the final acts of T1 and T2. They were fairly lengthy scenes, and the bad guy never caught their targets but seriously fucked up anyone they did catch.&&True, but if the resistance are capable of it then Skynet should be able to manage more than one.&&What I don't get is why a factory built by robots to produce robots would have walk ways and access points for people. I pictured the factories being machines of their own right that basically shit out terminators. If something went wrong you could have small robot internally dispatched to fix something. &&Kyle Reese: It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed. We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence!

Dr. Silberman: Is that when you captured the lab complex and found the, uh, what was it called... the time displacement equipment?

Reese: That's right. The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me to intercept him and they blew the whole place.&&So when does Skynet and the Resistance send through the T2 and T3 robots?&&Multiple Arnie's might be suspicious but they can shapeshift in the second one.

I just realised the T-1000 does the worst thing it could do if it's trying to avoid attention. It kills and then imitates a cop. &&It's the worst terminator movie that doesn't have Jai Courtney in it. Sort of like how Die Hard 2 is the worst Die Hard movie that doesn't have Jai Courtney in it. Christ, Jai Courtney sucks. &&I can think of at least one Terminator film without Cameron and with Arnie that sucked. And another that was meh.&&They all got spoiled by the trailers. 

[Spoilers below, obviously]

The first film spends about a half-hour showing Kyle and the Terminator both stalking Sarah with no context. You know the Terminator is evil becuase it murders a bunch of people, but Kyle steals shit, is generally creepy, and is having flashbacks in cars where he nearly shoots stuff with his sawed-off shotgun. It's not until the parking garage scene that Kyle explains that he's the good guy.

The trailer spoiled all of that.

The second film doesn't take as long to establish that Uncle Bob is the good guy, but fairly close. Same deal. Spoiled in the trailers.

The third film's only twist is that Judgment Day happens at the end, and that was in the trailers.

The fourth film's major twist was that Marcus is a terminator, which was in the trailers.

The fifth film's major twist was that John is a terminator, which was in the trailers.

This series has many problems, but this one is chronic.&&Only if you watched mtv.  I saw the movie the first time having not scene that music video.  The opening scene where his theme is bad to the bone.   I thought he was the evil cyborg also.

Avoid movie marketing at all costs if you want to enjoy movies on a new level.  I call it my dark mode. &&We Blade Runner now &&First of all, Russell Crowe doesn't break character until he's done the DVD commentary, no time for that.&&He welcomed the criticism and said it was deserved too. I’ve only known a couple people who have had interactions with him, and all have had nothing but good things to say. &&Other Hollywood actors stood up for him because the dude legitimately broke his concentration. He could have handled it better, yes, but they call quiet on set for a reason.&&He was also having major family problems at the time.&&[deleted]&&That was part 5 with the son. 4 was with the daughter and hackers riding in a semi trailer blowing up power plants. &&IIRC the Xenomorphs were created by the Engineers as weapons of war. &&Especially if Nolan wrote it. Sounds slightly cheesy, but I bet he did it in a badass way.&&If the resistance fails to stop John Conner from being killed by skynet, and the resistance continues to thrive, the jig is up, as they say.

Sending one man back, having John survive, or at least claiming he survived, seems like a worthwhile sacrifice. It protects the secret while reinforcing the legend of John Conner.&&[deleted]&&I was thinking of interstellar apologies &&Graveler Golem&&Just how funky is it, exactly?&&*grabs scalpel*&&There's probably a gay porn series that uses this exact concept.&&Huey Lewis never actually wanted to make SPORTS, but then The News were all like, “Please.” So the Huey said, “Ok.”&&TBF, De Niro said he'd stop taking shitty roles if his wife stopped spending all his money.

Bale tends to take quirky roles, he was fantastic in The Fighter and he is my favourite Batman.  Big fan of the Prestige too.&&> I bet people said this about Robert de Niro and Pacino in the 90s lol

Analyze that, you fockers.&&Maybe... things get tricky when you get old in Hollywood. there are a lot less opportunities I think. If you want to keep acting through your sixties as a male I think you typically have to make some compromises. Obviously not every one does but if the actor has an expectation that they can star in a big movie every year they have to start taking shitty movies.&&Yeah but the more you have, the higher the price to break the rules. If you're worth several million already. You probably have a very high ceiling.



I know myself and other folks that tend to not give a shit until you're told ""You can't do that"". It's like they threw down the gauntlet and you feel challenged by it. All of the sudden something that bores you becomes fascinating due to that.

It's the sign of someone with a competitive nature. And I can totally see Bale being that way considering how he throws himself into other roles like the Machinist, the Fighter, Hustler and others.&&Agreed. He's really one of the few A-listers I don't see as themselves in movies. Occasionally I still see him as Batman/Bruce but that usually is only if he puts on a tux. &&>  including one which is often considered the best

wait, what does Michael Keaton have to do with this again?&&He was fucking excellent in The Departed. &&Boogie Nights and I Heart Huckabees too. &&It's always weird finding out two people you knew of independently of each other are closely related like that.&&Context?

My hag mother married a crippled old breathing wallet when I was 17 right before moving out, and whether I like it or not, he’s my stepfather. It describes the relationship in a single word rather than a pedantically distancing phrase. &&As a 26 year old about to receive a ‘stepmother’ I agree. &&Ok sure, they’re cheaper but they’re far less effective at removing dirt..&&Yup. People still take Fight Club at face value, even.&&Also some people are idiots and think that Bateman is cool. He kinda is (or atleast leads a “cool” life) but like that’s not the point. &&And D-Fens in ""Falling Down"".  Without spoiling it, we aren't supposed to cheer for him we are supposed to get the sick twisted irony of his character.  The everyman who just... falls... Down and doesn't realize it's happening.&&But even then, the people that idolize those characters don't necessarily want to be like them. They just enjoy them as fictional characters. &&Rorshach's popularity is another great example &&They do? I would like to know more!&&Who does?&&And here I am thinking that war is bad mmmkay?  What a fool I am.  I definitely should have known more.&&Hell, I'm pretty desensitized if you will, but Black mirror , to me at least, is different. Black mirror hits certain mental/emotional cords that can wreak havoc on people. I remember after watching he 3rd episode of season one, I stopped watching the series for a bit. They were tough to keep up with in regards to the emotion that they bring out in me, personally.&&https://youtu.be/okJHQ3hjqrI&&[deleted]&&Eg terminator 1&&You’re giving classic movies too much credit. A few might have but plenty didn’t even back then. &&Yeah that’s exactly my point, they can’t do it right so it ends up being a few minutes of each person winning the fight for a bit. Awful to watch &&Wasn't the whole premise in the first movie that skynet was about to be defeated so they sent a terminator back in time to kill Sarah Conner? Besides that, the machines would want to be logical about it. Why send more units than necessary? They couldn't have known the resistance would send a person back to stop their unit.&&T2 shows that the timeline changed as a result of the events of T1.

So the hows and whys of future assassination cyborgs does not need to match the timeline of the original.

&&It investigated itself and found no wrongdoing. &&> I just realised the T-1000 does the worst thing it could do if it's trying to avoid attention. It kills and then imitates a cop.

What, are you kidding? No one questions cops, not even other cops. They can do whatever they want, whenever they want and not answer to anyone. &&To be fair, it does star Jai Courtney's typecasting predecessor: Sam Worthington.&&How do you rank the suicide squad movies? &&Did. Varro was awesome.  Give him credit there.&&How about the new Terminator film that has *both* Arnold and Cameron involved?

Does it give you a new hope?&&Aint no cell phones in the 19th century man he's head to toe legit&&I guess, but bale is about as 'method actor' as you can get too.  I think bale is actually a nice guy with the occasional outburst.&&I'm not sure if you actually mean this, or if you just wanted to make a Tropic Thunder reference.&&We like to call Jai Courtney ""The Franchise Killer""&&Dolan, Pls&&Too funky for Bale, apparently. That guy could never handle it.&&What about bateman &&The one that always got me was Nicolas Cage and Francis Ford Coppola being nephew/uncle and Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight being daughter/father, though the later is more obvious to the older generation.&&Yeeees, very strange.

You're not supposed to still be rooting for him by the end of the series.  Drives me nuts.&&He’s not even cool in the book, he’s miserable and pathetic. He has mental breakdowns over the dumbest, most meaningless shit, and his insecurity is constantly taken advantage of by salespeople offering luxury-grade “solutions” to nonexistent problems. &&To some people Bateman can become a twisted fantasy. For a guy working a dead end office job with a shitty boss the thought of choping him up with an axe or murdering an outshining coworker can become a morbid daydream.

I googled it and you're right but holy moly. I never would have guessed.&&Nic Cage intentionally didn’t want to use his actual surname because he wanted to make it on his own merit and not just ride off the Coppola family name. I think early on he was still credited as Nic Coppola in fast times at ridgemont high&&Where is nepotism not prevalent in America?&&I think the ""glamorization"" is partially a product of film being a visual medium. The audience has to be seduced by Durden, just as the narrator is at first seduced. 

There are tells, though, that the glamorization is farce. The way Durden becomes comically more and more fabulous and beautiful, dressed in flamboyant unbuttoned leather coats that show off his washboard abs, while the narrator's body decays, dressed in bloodstained shirts and his teeth falling out of his head.

I think, part of the problem too, is that people don't reconcile the twist with the rest of the plot. The narrator is clearly delusional, and if you re-watch his interactions with Marla with that in mind it becomes clear that he's just a creep who can't talk to women good.

That's why I sort of appreciate the ending of the movie, more than the book. It works better in the visual medium at least, to show the narrator reject hyper-masculinity (big ol' dicks literally exploding) in favor of some third way (that is, he can interact with Marla as a human being not as a fictional image of Brad Pitt), accepting whatever comes next. 

The book is more cynical, in a cool way, though. Because it makes it clear that Project Mayhem has spun impossibly far out of the narrator's control. It kinda works as a very explicit criticism of the idea of heroes, or powerful leaders of movements: they all may as well be lunatics in an asylum, while likeminded lunatics still outside the asylum run rampant, their ideology based on pure fiction.&&I thought that the point of Fight Club was in regards to how males find father figures in other males. It was in response to another popular book geared towards women in the same situation. I remember reading a quote from Palhanuik in which he explains this concept. Maybe I'm just simplifying what you've said already, as that kind of is a satire. Also, it's been many years but the ending [isn't that he doesn't accept the demolition, but that the recipe they used for the explosives didn't work out. He mentions early on in the book how they could never get it quite right.](#spoiler) 

Here's to hoping that I did the spoiler thing right. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Edit: Fuck yeah! It worked! [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]

Edit 2: [a link to an interview with Palahnuik on Fight Club, and it's graphic novel sequel. Very enlightening. ](http://www.unboundworlds.com/2016/06/interview-chuck-palahniuk-on-tyler-durden-dead-poets-and-fight-club-2/)&&This is why one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when he has a meltdown over his coworker having an insignificantly better business card than him. 

It's one of the most petty inner monologues I've seen in a movie, but maybe the way he plays it completely straight makes certain types of movie-goers miss the comedy. &&lmao ya in the book hes literally the biggest insecure douchebag of a character ive ever seen. he constantly judges people based on their clothes and makes crazy assumptions about them and is a really miserable and pathetic narcissist with a horribly fragile ego. god damn hes a good character but not for the reason those people think &&That’s not the books fault though. People will have those morbid daydreams regardless of the media they consume.&&Is Batman so cool though? He beats up criminals leaving them with broken bones and unconscious in snow filled streets or cold rainy nights. He leaves people hanging upside down all the time. 

Instead of dealing with his psychological problems of his parents death. He breaks laws to give his vengeance. He's not a good dude if you really think about it. 

I say this as a Batman fan but if you really break it down. He's a terrible person who isn't doing any good because crime never gets any better. He only works one shift any ways at night. So criminals know that they can do whatever during the day. They're only afraid of him when he's around. Otherwise they mock him like ""better hurry and load up those stolen tvs, the Batman will get ya"" 

""haha yeah Frank I'm so scared"" &&Wait. Batman, Bateman...Bale?

Watching Andy jump and spin  on a  chair with Woody was unreal. Especially when nothing else like it had been seen.

Sure we had trippy computer generated videos like The Minds Eye. Toy Story however was life changing and still is!

I mean who didn't let out a tear when they thought Woody & the gang were not going to die by either shark or death by monkeys but by incineration at the end of Toy Story 3?

I mean come on! After I walked out of the theatres I couldn't help but sing [You've Got  A Friend In Me](https://youtu.be/nMN4JZ8crVY)&&They started production in 1997, Windows 98 wasn’t released in retail until June 98.

Almost nobody had Windows 98.  It’s safe to say the majority of computers were still running DOS with newer ones running Windows 95 and at the very end of production some cutting edge machines and early adopters were running Windows 98.

All of which makes their achievement even more impressive.  Though of course we put people on  the moon before personal computers were even available in stores outside of kit form so...&&I loved this scene so much simply because of all the detail &&Seeing the comments made here about the computers of the time and the effort Pixar took to make Toy Story 2 reminds me of Reboot.

Making Reboot took an entire room filled with computer towers, and even more knowledge and effort than Pixar took.  And the show came out in 1994.  So just creating everything in the era of Windows 3.1 ...  I'd like to think that none of the Pixar movies would've been made to the same standard if it weren't for Reboot.&&Makes it that much sadder that Pixar is just a profit center for Disney now, with all of their new movies focused on merchandise and franchises (in a manner unlike the first two Toy Stories, where there was obvious passion behind the work. Nobody other than stockholders are dying for sequels to Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc. that are complete rehashes of the originals, cheapening their overall value. Also, Cars 3). &&The music really reminds me of Fable&&I remember as a kid when i watched this i was so entranced by this scene, it blew my mind as a kid that someone would go through so much effort to make a toy look new! What a blast to the past.&&Isn’t the same old guy in the chess short?&&Hang on. Is that guy Geri from [Geri’s Game](https://youtu.be/9IYRC7g2ICg)?&&The biggest issue I have with this scene is that he doesn't fix the arm first.  Maybe it's my OCD, but I would think you would fix the biggest problem first.  If you can't fix that, you've wasted all the time working on the other stuff. 

Actually I think it would have had a bigger impact showing the unsteady hand first with the needle and thread.  Leave the audience unsure of his abilities until the moment he starts sewing the arm together.  The way it is shown here, you already know the guy is an artist.

Still a great scene and great movie. &&""You can't rush art."" I get the impression the animators for this scene took that line to heart.&&What I love the most is his hands. Look at them when he sews Woody's hand on - have you ever seen an old artisan work? I have, and it is exactly like that. Hand shaky up until the final moment, after which each and every move is done with precision, steadiness and experience.

Fantastic detail.&&This scene felt weird when I first watched it. I felt like I needed to hate the old cranky old man (as a kid) but then wen the tone changes once he get's into his work and you see that it's more about his artistry it sort of rocked my adolescent mind&&Wait, is that the guy from the chess scene?? &&Why have I never seen this scene in a try not to get satisfied video?&&Does anyone remember this same old man playing chess against himself?

Thanks for drawing out attention to it in 2018.&&This is like my favorite part of the movie just based off the details alone&&Cleaning guy with classic Parkinsonism - tremor at rest and with slow movement, smoothed out motion when making larger more emphatic movements. &&This is my favorite scene in all the pixar movies. Anytime it's on I watch it, and sometimes rewind and watch again.

Some of the best ever &&Does anyone know what the specs were on the computers used to render this movie? I know they were made up of many many computers as a ""render farm"". But what were the specs of each...? &&Is not only the animators job also the lighting artists, 3d modellers, director,textures,rigging etc etc&&I feel like they were probably running an Apple OS but that doesn't make this less impressive&&It's not like it was rendered in real time.&&this is my favorite animated scene ever.&&It was also the reason the Best Animated Film category was created for the Oscars. There was significant enough backlash that Toy Story 2 wasn't nominated for Best Picture that they created a separate category.

Personally I think it was also to appease the people making animated movies as much as the people who think animated movies shouldn't get the same recognition as live action. But every now and then Pixar still manages to get Best Picture or Best Original Screenplay nod.&&It might have been ugly but man, I LOVED that game! &&But.... I remember Sony telling me the PS2 will render *Toy Story* quality graphics in real time.&&To be fair this is still true.  Compare what they can pull off in movies  versus games, its still a big rift.  But that makes sense, games have to render in real time, movies can render a 1 minute detail  that would take a PS4 months to render.   When you are watching a movie where the characters are obviously occupying some sort of 3D space the movie isn't rendering all the objects in 3D (even if you are watching it in 3D, that is different, its two 2D images essentially).  

Compare the World of Wacraft cinematic trailers to the actual game.  This chasm will always exist until real time rendering gets better than our eyes can detect then the difference won't matter. &&Does anyone remember the CD-Rom version of Muppet Treasure Island?

[Piper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkQTe0Wdo2k)&&Yeah definitely intentional, as the original look of the toy would have that brushstroke look on the boot. Also, they probably wanted to use that effect because it was so satisfying. &&In some ways I prefer this, but I miss the music that plays as he's sewing Woody's arm back on. It really adds to the distressing feeling you get, since you're anxious something might go wrong, and the music reinforces this tension. But then it goes back to being upbeat as the man is going about his work.&&Shoutout to the sound crew, Gary Rydstrom, Tom Myers and the rest. In an animated film *nothing* can be recorded ""on set"" or from ""props"" (I don't think much of that goes on much with live-action movies either though).&&Better? How is it better without music?&&I remember everyone being so excited to see the ""chess board guy"" again. &&That's ASMR, look it up in YouTube. &&Watching that scene as a kid stressed me out so much.

&&And ASMR-ers.  My husband will almost fall asleep every time that scene comes on.&&They use mostly proprietary animation tools for this. Pixar is a powerhouse, when it comes to developing animation and rendering tools.

Second time: They went to their backups. This is in 1998 so most system backups were done on tapes. Toy Story 2 was a 10 gig project, but the tape had a 4 gig data limit. As a result when new data was copied onto the drive it was pushing the oldest files out, and because Pixar was (foolishly) not testing backups, they didn't notice this until they had to do a full restore. They noticed anomalies and upon checking, found that file and asset versions were dozens or hundreds of iterations behind current, and they had no way to see which or how many files those were without manually checking everything, and no way to replace the missing work.

So basically an unfortunate mistake compounded by poor backup practices.&&The first time it was a accident, second time the film wasnt great and was completely rewritten.

I mean, speaking as someone who does computer graphics as a hobbyist, writing an algorithm to render that scene is *relatively* easy to do. It's just a matter of making sure your shaders/kernels are written correctly and sequenced correctly.

But this is the year 2018. I have, literally, thousands of times more computing power in my laptop than Pixar had in their entire server cluster. And I know for a fact that whatever algorithm I use is going to be considerably slower than it should be.

So I can't imagine what kinds of hacks they had to use.&&Everyone cries during that song, I don't care how tough you think you are.&&Maybe I should give it another go.

However there are some good examples of it coming SOMEWHAT close, but there are still a plethora of fine details that they just can't get right in comparison to TS2 level animation. 

Not even close. Maybe Toy Story 1, but Toy Story 2 looks far better than anything in gaming. There may be more photorealistic textures but then again Toy Story never tried to be photorealistic so its not a good measurement. In terms of the motion of the models and the ability to express emotions video games don't even hold a torch to Toy Story 2, let alone anything modern. &&It's the snow, Frozen is basically a technical demonstration of their snow rendering technology. Interesting thing is that this each movie a technical demo is usually Pixar's forte. Same thing happened with Big Hero 6, it was showing of a new lighting system.&&This is one of the reasons why I find brains so insanely impressive.  Sure my brain doesn't render reality perfectly and it has its own shortcuts.  But my brain simulates snow better than Frozen and it does it in near real time.  Way to go brain. &&Typically, time measurements like that will be in computer-hours; You won't normally have more than one computer calculating a given frame, anyway.

I work at a small design studio doing 3d work, so we're typically trying to hit <30min per frame (per computer) when rendering animation... but it's not uncommon for feature films to take *much, much longer*.  For example, in Monsters University, any frame with Sully in it took up to 29 hours to render thanks to all his fur.  I've read (but can't find any sources now) that in Monsters Inc his frames took up to 12 hours to render, and I'd guess that nowadays 12 hours / frame of theater-ready animation is on the low end of the spectrum.&&For video games we aren't close.  I would say we are a few decades away.  We can make things look really good but we are still cheating like crazy.

To make things move and act like real physics takes forever to render.    Just look at some of the really cool stuff people are making and you realize... oh yeah video games can't do that, not even close.

Everyone knows that if you have a crappy game or a good game that's horrible broken you release it before fixing it.  Them promise to fix it and don't.  Then promise none of that will ever happen again and it's not fixed because it will be in the next game.

Source: Set up my Amiga on 3D Studio MAX to render an image before I went to bed... Still wasn't done by morning and I had to wait until I got home from work to see the final image.

Animation is keyframed, aka, animated frame-by-frame, but not limited by or to the camera, aka, ""the composition"" of a scene. What's great is that once the scene is completely animated, they can literally move the camera anywhere they want in the digital space, adjust virtual lighting as needed, there's no resetting and refilming, wires, stands, etc to worry about. Just add final touches for the render treatment. 

Not always recommended, as they do ""cheat"" by selectively animating only what the frame can see. An example would be in the first film when the Army Men jump off the stairs and parachute. In the computer, there were actually 2 sets of army men. The ones that jumped off were pulled through the wall once they were out of frame. The other set were already there, not moving until the camera first glimpses them. I believe this was due to the inability to accurate show the parachute fully deploying from their backs. It's on the special features of one of the DVDs. EDIT: [This Shot](https://youtu.be/FeIP17_UWq8?t=45)

Any currwnt game really isn't even close to being comparable with Toy Story 2. See [here](https://youtu.be/tkDadVrBr1Y)&&> Not even close. Maybe Toy Story 1, but Toy Story 2 looks far better than anything in gaming.

Honestly, there is no objective metric that would make comparing a modern video game to an early computer animated film meaningful. The goal of a computer game is to render as many frames as fast as possible and that generally isn't a concern with a film. A game is throwing every trick in the book at the render process to pump out 30, 60 or more frames every second. It takes a render farm (i.e. an entire network of server grade computers) hours to render a single frame of animation. The animation process is about accuracy and making everything look as perfect and convincing as humanly possible while a game is all about creating a facade that is playable. Games still pre-bake lighting and shadows in many cases, have rudimentary reflections, and lean heavily on displacement and normal maps instead of geometry to add details to characters and objects. 

In the end this means there there are aspects of modern computer games that look much better than early computer animated films (though much of this can be attributed to art style and really depends on a case by case basis) particularly in regard to animation since there are so many tools on the market now that automate major chunks of the animation process (think motion capture). Things like reflections, lighting and things like volumetric effects that really kill render times will still be better in an early animation film. 

TLDR; despite using similar tools, game artists and film animation artist approach their work very differently to suit the needs of the medium that they are working in. Therefor there isn't any kind of meaningful measure between the ""quality"" of their work at a given period of time. &&[Are you sure you know what you're talking about](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/2718166-rsg_gtav_ng_screenshot_006.jpg)?

Maybe if this was 2005, that statement would be acceptable, but most modern games look a lot better than Toy Story 2. Have you seen the new [DOOM](http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories//2016May/1_051616121941.jpg) or [Wolfenstein](https://i.imgur.com/CMBkhJn.jpg), or even the later canned [PT](http://nerdreactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TP-Silent-Hills-PS4.jpg)? 

However, I understand the modern equivalent would be like a movie completely indistinguishable from real-life, maybe somehow better, in fact, with shitloads of detail put into it, especially since the most impressive games that year looked [like this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C7Wj1n0lV4A/maxresdefault.jpg), and physics were barely even a thing yet.&&I'm not sure if Pixar had a hand in Moana, but I know that movie was specifically a tech-demo for hair physics.

Video games still won't reach the detail level of Toy Story 1 for decades because CGI movies have the benefit of a human artist doing touch ups after things are rendered and no thoughtless algorithm can ever hope to beat that.

If you removed the post rendering human touch ups it'd be much different and a much more fair comparison.&&Well it’s a little difficult to just compare it like that. If you split it up there are things that are done way better in games now. Just look at the lighting in toy story and you can compare it to many modern games. Even real time solutions with dynamic gi is getting interestingly good nowadays. 

You can also render a lot of very dense stuff in real time now. 
The difference I think people don’t tend to think about is every shot in a movie is directed. That little brush, or that small corner of the table with the wood grains modeled out... that’s all fine when you have a fixed camera and shots have been nailed - you won’t model that whole table in that fidelity. In (almost all) games that is far from the case. Stuff often has to look good from every angle, be performant, with a still pretty low budget.

Edit: sorry this became kinda messy, writing on the phone and a few beers doesn’t help...

I’m honestly often pretty surprised when I have a chance to see some of the conematic/movie workflows coming from games and how primitive their tools/technology sometime is.

With 1 redundant that sounds like an accident waiting to happen.&&Mortal Kombat Bloody Hentai Dealer?&&Who&&Well as of like 8-10 years ago the average movie was about 120-160gb of jpeg 2000 files in the format it's sent to theaters.&&Star Wars for example, is composed of 174,258 frames.

at 1920x1080 each, with 3 channels, and 8 bits per channel it would take up 1,084,024,166,400 bytes uncompressed.

that's basically a terabyte.

With lossless compression which averages about 12.5 times these days, it would take up 86GBs.

but that's just an estimate, it HEAVILY depends on the content of the actual frames.

So between 86 and 172 gbs is a good guess

At 4k 12 bit you're looking at 6.5 terabytes uncompressed.

at 8k 16 bit, you're looking at 34 terabytes uncompressed.&&That's not the movie lol, it's the assets to render the movie.

It's a very good and detailed article as well.&&Motherfucker that was you!!!!!!!!!!!!&&Pretty much every university in Australia uses them for anabytes of research data. Except for U Melbourne and U Sydney, who deeply regret their decision and are trying to return to tape&&You're right. It happens.  The time between rm -rf and realizing ""oh shit!"" can be only one or two seconds but long enough to wipe out a lot of stuff.  &&Reminds me of the time I was doing a hand-counted inventory of hospital narcotics (hydromorphone I think) and, when the system failed to ask me the expiration date, I assumed the process got canceled so I did it again. 

The first time I said 0 were in the drawer to start and X were in the drawer when I finished. 

The second time, I said 0 were in the drawer to start (as there had been when I first got there) and that I had added X. 

At the second attempt, the system saw that as ""expected X, found 0"" and then ""X added."" The system thought someone had stolen X the second time when I originally said there were none there. That introduced a fuck ton of red flags. 

The cold chill I got when I finally realized my mistake was just as you said. &&Exactly.  That's why many companies do disaster recovery exercises.  You pretend that your production server just went kaput and you have to rebuild it on a separate network and get everything working within a certain time period.&&Good IT operations/infrastructure guys are expensive as fuck, and not a lot of companies are willing to pay their worth, which results in those random disasters from time to time.&&Storing data & keeping backups wasn't 'new stuff' in the late 90s. They just had poor practices. &&Well, that's certainly one way to free up a lot of server space.&&Thanks for explaining it like that, that makes a lot of sense&&The RAM mines are running dry we really need to start conserving. &&Almost. They place the camera (in that scene's case) before rendering. Rendering is the absolute last thing done before it goes out to the edit bay.&&Placing the camera is the absolute first thing to do when animating. After the camera position, its movements are set, then the animator starts to work on the scene. 

The camera setup is the job of composition artists and not the animator. So after the scene is okayed by the storyboard artists, composition guys setup the scene with the camera and the set and then the start and end positions of the character. 

After this it is the job of the animator to make everything come to life. 

Rendering is only done at the end. Before this the animator works with a very ugly scene with no hair simulation, lighting, fluids, or fur. All that is added later. &&Which kind of work?

Animation has several stages in it and each is its own separate department.&&The flip side is that a movie scene only needs to hold up from one viewing angle, so there are a ton of visual hacks that fall apart as soon as you move the camera or look around.  In a 3D game you have to build out a whole environment if the player can move around and look in any direction.&&You’d be surprised. Pixar didn’t even use Global Illumination until a couple of years ago. More efficient rendering techniques still save on render time and therefore money. &&Well, look at it another way. Computers today could render Toy Story a lot faster than computers then could render today's video games.&&Games use shadow buffers instead of raytracing, but that's just a hardware-adapted technique that was used exclusively for 90's Toy Story shadow rendering because raytracing was too expensive at the time. 

Planar reflections were done by slicing the whole scene by the reflecting surface, removing everything under the reflector, flipping the scene (or the camera, but not both) by the normal of plane, and storing this flipped rendered version in a texture that was looked up in the final render and could be distorted by a bump map to fake deflected raytraced rays. This is nearly identical to a technique used in games today.

Renderman was closer to a rasterizer before they introduced more modern stuff like the RIS engine for physically-based path traced renders in version 19 in 2014. And basic raytracing wasn't even a feature until version 11 in 2002.&&I have yet to see facial animation in any game, including 2017's AAA releases, that comes close to the same galaxy as was seen in L.A. Noire. Even after all this time L. A. Noire's face animation is second to none. It's good enough for those who are able to to read the characters' lips. 

(For accuracy: it wasn't really technically animated, but motion captured from human actors in exquisite detail. I'm not certain any other studio has done that to that degree, before or since.) &&I don't think that has much to do with the conversation. The comparison is inherently unfair. It's this unfairness itself that makes the comparison worthwhile. Further, I'm not sure you can just separate the technology from the artist like you have. Should we say modern games don't count if they use artistic tricks that improve performance like baked in shadows? I think we should judge the overall end product.  &&It might've also been water physics. 90% of the movie takes place in open water, compared to Toy Story which had no visible liquids.&&dreams are still pretty fucking cool&&What, doing lighting as textures?&&The snow physics in Frozen was insane. &&its overkill, but his video is damn nice to look at. how can you call yourself a tech reviewer when your video max at 720p..&&Yeah Red cameras shoot Raw 8K footage for the editors not because they plan on exporting videos at that size.

Shit, people still buy dvds even when blurays are available.

At a certain point, you just stop giving a shit. Also, rebuying dozens of movies just because they have been rereleased in higher quality can be very expensive and annoying.

&&Although I find it extremely surprising that the whole movie is only 10 gigs of data, the entire story doesn't hold water unless it's small enough that it could have conceivably been taken to someone's house back in the 90's.

I'm sure I'm missing the point somehow.&&I feel a pretty close contender to best facial animations of 2017 is Injustice 2:

It's great that when the community gave a huge critique to Netherealm's Studios' previous faces in games, they double-downed on improving them.&&Sadly LA Noire's lipsync tech was only a test and is prohibitively expensive, so no one is keen on developing it further and making it cheaper.

It really was great. The rest of the game, even the face textures look like dogshit, but the expressions are dope.

When I was younger I expected to see it in more games, but I can see why it never took off.

Though of course, it may return someday. Maybe it has returned in LA Noire VR but that doesn't count imo. &&To be fair, wasn't that like *the entire point* of LA Noire? It makes sense they would put a lot more time any money into facial animation than other games.&&The facial animations for Half-Life 2 still hold up to this day IMO&&>I don't think that has much to do with the conversation. The comparison is inherently unfair. It's this unfairness itself that makes the comparison worthwhile.

Not necessarily true. We use the same kind of technology and methodology to render the images. CGI movies are simply rendered over a long time for better results, and being able to do it in real time is a measure of how far we've come. *That* is fair. 

It becomes unfair in the post rendering, where the methods diverge. The video linked is pointing out post rendering methods in the movie and nothing more. 

   &&Finding Nemo is the water demo for Pixar. &&Kind of. In some games they will essentially prerender the lighting on the textures and objects in the a room, instead of working things out in real time. When a game boasts that it is using dynamic lighting, you know it's not doing this&&""Real"" lighting like movies do it means ray-tracing, that's where you simulate many individual beams (""rays"") of light, fire them out of the lights in the scene, and bounce them around a bunch of times until they hit the camera. Just like how actual light works. This produces very realistic lighting, and does most of the hard parts automatically, but for the most part this is still too slow for games.

Games use tricks to approximate similar effects, but they don't actually bounce rays of light around. It's a fundamentally different process, and not as realistic.

Shadows are a good example of this. In ray-tracing, shadows happen automatically because objects in the scene block the rays. In games, we have to use various tricks to work out where shadows should be and then draw them in. Often you'll see shadows are lower-resolution than everything else, or small fast-moving objects don't have shadows at all.&&What the prior poster is going on about is probably pre-baked lighting or cheap reflection models (like mirrors in game not reflecting the character), but top of the line engines for modern games do a lot of needless real-time rendering (check out [Metal Gear Solid V's rendering system](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2017/12/15/mgs-v-graphics-study/) for example).

Two, three years ago you could argue that every game cuts corners everywhere, but modern visual rendering systems are finally reaching showfloor demo levels.&&That is Baked lighting and is a common one but basically speaking there is rarely true lighting in the sense that there is light coming from the sky and reflecting across the world to generate the scene. It's nearly  all just adjusting brightness and the global light with some shadow casting. Those shadows are not there because they are blocking light, it'd be more apt to say that the object is generating shadow in that direction.

Movies on the other hand can use ray tracing. An extremely resource intensive method but one that is actually shooting ""photons"" into the scene and calculating how each one is reflecting and how it lights the scene. And it does that for every frame. In Frozen, during the ""let it go scene"" the mountains in the background and physical objects that are acting on the lighting, hence the enormous compute power needed for each frame and is the main reason they use render farms, a huge group of computers all working on different parts to create the whole. And that's not even counting the physics and effects. &&It's gonna be really useful for him down the line, when 8K is a norm, higher bitrate (On YouTube, maybe some other sites) uploading is available and he has to re-upload his old stuff and mainly to use old footage in new videos (Maybe bloopers, Maybe a highlight video for his 10 years on YouTube and stuff like that). &&I'm only on 1440p on my home monitor and I feel like he's really in my room with me.&&Yeah, it's ridiculous how Amazon advertises them as ""hot deals"" or whatever, even when all the real reviews are outing the product as fake. &&In other words, the so-called 1024GB/1TB ones are more than likely outright bullshit... especially at the prices I saw on eBay.&&I would have given my left nut to have had that back in 2002 when I lost my data. I lost several years of hard work in a flash, and a local data recovery place couldn't recover it, although they had the nerve to charge me thousands of dollars. I never got the drive back because they held it hostage for the money. I was young and didn't have a lot of money, but the data was priceless. My CDROM backups also failed. I had some software to split data over multiple CDs. One cd was unreadable and the whole thing failed. I spent years producing music and all my masters, my samples, and working files were on there. All my digital photography, which for the time was a lot. Many thousands of pictures and videos. All I have left are some rough mixdowns and any photo I took between 2000 and 2002 were lost. I was in my late teens and early 20s, so it was a lot of memories I would have killed to keep. The music was the most important loss, however, and because of it, I switched careers because I couldn't afford another few years of work before succeeding. It was so heartbreaking. It was a seagate drive, too. &&My dad was a computer engineer for backup systems and used to work for seagate. I never understood what the hell he did until I was in my 20’s. If only someone would’ve used this analogy, I would have got it.&&With some exceptions people will stop buying physical copies period &&Cloud isn't secure, especially for commercial assets. Tape backups and generally considered a great option, even today.&&[deleted]&&Honestly it's really not comparable and different methods would have to be used to approximate the same things. I was being overly simplistic. I believe they did some things manually back in the day and pointless software would have to be written just to try and make it run in real time the same way.

As to 1995 super computers (I was talking about Toy Story 1) vs modern PCs... I understand that in most ways the i7 would whoop ass, but then they are used in very specialized situations like scientific calculations or whatever so... it all comes down to the software and what it's doing I suppose.&&Came here to mention this.

Look at the review history of the top reviewers. Usually they have like, 4 other 5-star reviews. If you compare the top reviewers, a lot of times they actually reviewed the same things.

Another give away is the wording in the reviews.

Looking forward to the first teaser/trailer!&&Sonys insistence at having a Spiderman universe without Spidey is so baffling. All they had to do was have a tiny bit of patience and let Holland get the symbiote in IW, then they'd have massive anticipation for a solo Venom flick. &&Give me my first look at the venom suit &&Theory about how they will be doing Venom without Spiderman:

I think they will simply write that the symbiote was created in a lab (like in the Ultimates universe) as a part of the same project that resulted in the spider that bit Peter.

Simple, elegant solution.&&I can't be the only one who is still feeling kinda like ""nah, I don't think this movie is actually happening""...&&Fuck it i'm interested

Tom Hardy turned down Suicide Squad, and apparently X-Men Apocalypse too. If he turned them down but not this, there's gotta be something here that is going for it to convince him&&[deleted]&&Already? Didn't they just start recently?&&Still *a lot* of concerns for this movie.

The producers and writers for this movie are just...terrible. Zero faith in them. Only got any in the director, who has at least directed some good and above-average movies.

Big question though is if this movie will *ACTUALLY* be rated R (which they said it will be). But, if it is, how much is production? I doubt it's anything over $100M, which would then mean that either the CGI effects for Venom and Carnage are mediocre OR they're barely in the movie to save costs (which kinda defeats the point of a movie titled ""Venom"".)

If they're ACTUALLY going to be faithful to their appearance in the comics and not pull a ""Spider-Man 3"" - [Venom is often depicted as a hulking giant that towers over Spider-Man.](http://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/venom.jpg)

He's basically a slightly smaller and gooier Hulk.

[And Carnage is even worse as he's often depicted with tendrils flying all over the place.](https://images.alphacoders.com/757/757813.png)

I just can't imagine seeing these guys that much in the movie on a potential level R-Rated budget like that. But, maybe I'm wrong and the production budget might be something like $140M and Sony are banking on it making above $520M.

I also highly doubt that Holland is in the move, despite rumors (still don't have pictures of Spider-Man!)&&I can't believe that I'm real excited about this. Tom Hardy is one of my favorites and Venom is one of my favorite characters. Can't wait honestly.&&I’m a big superhero movie fan but this just isn’t exciting to me. I think Sony’s whole concept of “Spider Man Cinematic Universe without Spider Man” is kind of doomed to fail. If this took place in the MCU and Hardy’s Venom would eventually meet Holland’s Spider-Man, I would be much more invested but this is the first entry to a Cinematic universe whose existence is unnecessary.

That being said, if the reviews are really good, I’ll still go see it, but it isn’t automatically there like any MCU/FoX-Men/DCEU movies are. &&Can't be worse than Eric Foreman trying (and failing miserably) to play Venom.&&Tom Hardy, this gonna be good.

Sony Venom? This gonna be bad.

Tom Hardy though, this gonna be good.

Sony Venom + Tom Hardy? Please, please be good.
&&#WEAREVENOM&&I'm so incredibly excited for this film, while also being terrified. Venom is hands down my favorite character, and I want them to do him justice. They got off to a good start casting Hardy as Eddie Brock, since when I think of Brock I imagine the old Venom from the 90s.

I feel that to be able to fully capture the character, in addition to the *slim* chance of Carnage making an appearance, they have to give it an R rating.&&Alright then

1. I think Tom will be an excellent Venom, although I wish he would bring less dark humor & more ultra violence to the role; I know that won’t happen but I can dream.

2. For Carnage, I’m not too sure who would be the best actor for this guy I’m torn between Skårsgard and Mando, I think they both can bring their own flavor to Carnage.

Whatever happens; this movie is going to be awesome.

EDIT: Just a word

EDIT 2: Actually I just thought of this, if Patton were to voice the symbionts Venom/Carnage then that would elevate their characters to a whole new level&&God, if you exist, please dont let them fuck this up....

Is there a better subreddit?

Thanks y’all!&&Yes! I think redemption is coming for The Lethal Protector very soon.&&I think Marvel is waiting to see how it’s received before they say yes or no on it being part of the MCU. If it’s a flop, they’ll stay away from it but if it’s a hit, they’ll probably try to cut a deal with Sony to include Venom much like they did with Spidey. 

It’s a slippery slope since So y down own the rights to the Spideyverse so they do have the right to make these movies, but Marvel also wants a say because Spidey is now in their yard. So if Soney makes a shit movie & toss Tom Holland in it as Spidey, Marvel sorta has to now also own it as well.

I feel like we're going to get the Venom equivalent of the Halle Berry *Catwoman* movie—a multimillion dollar blockbuster film with top-tier A-list talent that nonetheless misunderstands and butchers the source material to the point where the end product is unwatchable 

I mean, *Zombieland* was great, but my fear is that there's just so much underlying corporate and political shit going on behind the scenes that there'll end up being a ton of pressure from upstairs to turn the character into something completely different, not for the sake of telling a good story, but in order to make him a lot more ""superhero franchise friendly""

Hopefully I'm completely wrong and it ends up being as good as *Homecoming*&&I didn't even realize they'd started acutually writing a script.  Its apparently got Tom Hardy as Venom, is part of the MCU, and is written by the people who wrote 50 Shades of Grey, The Dark Tower, and The Amazing Spider-man 2.  The director worked on Zombieland and nothing else of note that I see.  I love Tom Hardy so much I want this to be good but when your lead writer's last movie was 50 Shades of Grey I don't have much hope.&&Somehow some way Sony will mess this up. 

Just like every spider man movie&&I just want Sony to stop trying to make Spider-Man films.  Leave it to marvel so it can connect to the cinematic universe. &&I'm hoping he doesn't show up at all. Who would play Cletus?!, he's an unhinged psychopath and Carnage is the one saving grace the spiderman universe has over most of the comic based movies over the last couple of years. You need a seriously good actor to pull off that dark, twisted nuttyness of a personality of Carnage.....and *Zac Efron is busy at the min.*&&Carnage is so fucking dark that in the Batman/Spider-man crossover even The Joker wouldn't work with him

That's right. The fucking JOKER thought Carnage was too fucking dark. They better make him horror level scary

Honestly dream movie for me would be Maximum Carnage, where Spidey teams up with Deadpool, Venom and Jessica Jones. And it has to be R-rated&&It bugs me that they are introducing Carnage so soon. At least that's what the rumors seem to suggest. Just like Doomsday and ""Death Of Superman."" So much in the CBMs need to build up and give time for the inbetween storylines/characters to develop before jumping into the deep end.&&>Spider-Man

Respect the Hyphen &&The other big movies the writer wrote the screenplays for are The Amazing Spiderman 2, The Dark Tower, Jumanji, and The 5th Wave.

Avatar’s live action was done in 31 days, the mo cap another 31 days. Most of it was post production. 

A standard film with only a couple of different locations can wrap in 3-4 weeks. It’s films like Cap America Civil War that take like half a year, what with filming in 3 different continents and like a dozen locations. 

If Venom basically had to shoot on location in two cities on the same coast, with additional shooting done on sets in one of the cities, it could make for fast shooting, especially with Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed being more experienced than, say, Tom Holland and 4 kids, with Keaton having only like 4 scenes with Holland &&90% of it is going to be CGI done on computer they got what little real footage they needed.&&https://youtu.be/8P0aaIOnYiE found this one.&&Spidey finding the symbiote or the symbiote stowing away somewhere headed for Earth is the most logical way for Venom to be incorporated into the MCU.  But for some reason Sony is insisting on Venom without Spider-Man.  Problem is, there would be no Venom without Spider-Man.  It all seems very...how do I put this...stupid.&&> let Holland get the symbiote in IW

I don't think Marvel actually wants that to happen unless Sony willingly hands its Spider-man properties back. I remember the producer on this Venom movie being an idiot and saying this Venom movie was part of the MCU, which Feige corrected publicly. I don't think there's much confidence in Sony from Marvel's side.
&&Marvel Studios can only allow for so many Spider-Man movies in the MCU, at max one movie headlining Spider-Man every two years. Sony is a studio all about the $$$, they're not going to sit on all their other properties in wait, they're going to try to milk their relationship with the MCU for all its worth. Nothing else makes any sense from a business perspective.&&Every studio wants what Marvel has but they don't want to put in the time that Marvel has. It continues to turn out a misguided mess whenever they try to do it in only a few movies, imo. And by that I mean, so far, the DCEU and the ~~Tom Cruise~~  Universal Monsters shared universe.&&Was it ever said anywhere how long Spider-Man had been active between his start and civil war? He could of already done quite a lot of his things in that time. &&The logical idea here is to pick up with Eddie after some time he lost his fight with spider-man.  Allude to the symbiote having been on parker.  A fight, Eddie losing or struggling to come to grips that the symbiote is manipulating him and starts struggling to deal with it and himself.

Have it be part psychological struggle, and part coming to grips with the power he now wields.

Eddie wasn't a complete villain, he did become an anti-hero for a while.  So it's not wrong to have some character development and delve into the psychological aspects of the symbiote.&&They want this to be an R body horror film which I think is an amazing idea. How could that possibly happen in the marvel movie universe?&&[Here ya go!](https://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/42506/1-1/venom-deluxe-mens-costume.jpg)&&There is no suit, it's motion capture by Tom Hardy.

I imagine everything before that was on studio lots, etc. Personally I was surprised that was the tail end of their filming schedule. But a friend was telling me it's common to push location shooting towards the end of the production schedule. &&Filming on movies generally doesn't last longer than a month-and-a-half, and that's considering a few delays. There are exceptions, but those are usually really technically complex films; of which there's maybe one or two a year, if that.

Wait, are you serious?""&&I feel like Tom Holland was perfect for Peter Parker. He's supposed to be an annoying kid in the early days. Also, I'm a sucker for origin stories. The thing that peaks my interest about the venom movie is that the star of the movie is a villain. We don't get a lot of that these days. Deadpool's character is sort of chaotic neutral. Venom is just fucking evil. Also, Tom Hardy is fucking awesome. He can do no wrong in my book. I just hope that the writing is good.&&> I mean, Zombieland was great

This got me wondering what Zombieland has to do with anything, but apparently this movie has the same director.

Then I looked up who the writers were, and one of them has writing credits on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Tower. This does not fill me with enthusiasm.

Also, apparently Woody Harrelson is in this. And he's also in the Han Solo movie. For his sake, I hope at least one of these movies doesn't suck...

Potentially bolstering sales for:

1) Spider-man game, 

2) PS4 Pro &

 3) Venom Movie

This could be an experimental way of cross media narrative.&&Because Sony.&&The producer basically said it was being made to fit into the MCU (in the way daredevil and the other Netflix shows are ""fit into the MCU"" but don't actually interact with or effect the rest of the universe)  and Feige clarified that according to Marvel it isn't officially in the MCU. But you will be able to pretend it's in the MCU and it will work&&Yeah.. I'm pretty sure Fiege learned about Sony the hard way during all of Spider-Man: Homecomings press interviews.. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Spider-Man ends up leaving back to Sony because they constantly meddle in everyone's shit. &&Sony should just stfu and collect their money instead of ruining what they have&&Edward Brock, Mall Cop&&Wow this is virtually identical to how a bad ass Venom should look. Amazing job.&&Yeah sorry that's what I meant.

Probably safe to assume he won't be, considering they got Tom Hardy.&&Given that it's Sony, my expectations are *low*. I'm imagining a CGI suit painted onto Tom Hardy like Green Lantern.&&Spider-Man 3 has a lot of problems, even Venom had a lot of problems, but his design, form, and movement are near perfect in my opinion.

The fact that you named a movie from nearly ten years ago and just one other series kinda showcases how Hollywood aren't typically the best at managing money and that when they do, it's a pretty rare occasion.

Not to mention that (as far as we know) WETA is not working on ""Venom"" who were the ones responsible for ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"" and I'm...REALLY not confident in Sony managing costs well.

> And the writer Kelly Marcel wrote Saving Mr Banks.

It wasn't a first-page re-write as far as we know and she most likely just touched it up (they were WAY too far along in Pre-Production) so I doubt she had the time (or permission) to change anything of major significance.

Hopefully, the dialogue shouldn't be too bad at the very least.&&Be super awkward about it by mentioning him maybe once in dialogue, while also being vague about the time in which the movie takes place. Then moving Venom away from New York for some contrived reason, so as not to bring up the question of ""why doesn't Spider-Man just show up?"".&&It's not as hard as people think, considering that Eddie Brock hates Spider-Man for a completely indirect action.

When Venom was originally introduced in the comics, there was a serial killer on the loose in New York called Sin Eater, whose powers were owning a ski-mask and a shotgun.  Eddie Brock, a reporter, thought he was living next door to Sin Eater as he could hear his neighbor through the walls verbally confessing to his crimes as he wrote them down in his diary.  Except his neighbor was actually just a crazy guy who was pretending he was Sin Eater.  When Eddie goes to publish his expose piece, Spider-Man busts the actual Sin Eater.  Eddie is humiliated, fired, and blacklisted as a reporter for writing a fake newspiece.  At this point Eddie finds the symbiote and becomes Venom with a hard-on for justice and a hate-on for Spiderman.  You can still have this exact interaction go down without directly involving spiderman in the movie.  Just CGI some TV news spots of spiderman busting a killer on the loose and BAM, you have a Venom.  

As for the powers and the abilities, that's an easy bypass.  If Spider-man exits in-universe, than instead of the symbiote learning the powers form being bonded to spiderman, just have them replicate the powers based on Eddie wanting to do that stuff.  Super-strength, skin tight suits, and the ability to shoot tendrils to get around town are not unique powers after all.  Eddie gets the suit and decides that since he hates spider-,man, he's going to be a dark spider-man and simultaneously fight crime AND ruin Spider-Man's reputation.


Honestly it's pretty easy to detach Venom from Spider-Man if you focus on his psychopathy and anti-heroism rather than his unhealthy obsession with a high school boy.&&>The only thing I have any faith in is the cast, Williams and Hardy are superb actors/actresses and i hope they can carry the movie.

Yeah, but we've had *plenty* of terrible movies with spectacular casts, which makes it all the sadder when they're bad. I mean, I REALLY hope it is good (despite my annoyance with Sony trying to crowbar this into the MCU).

Dafoe is old and he isn't Carnage. Not even close.  We're talking head to head with Tom Hardy as Venom.

http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Carnage_Cosmic&&Carnage is basically a serial killer with super powers in a killing spree. That's it.

I don't doubt he's a cannibal either, considering the shit he does.&&Because Heath’s Joker had an idealistically driven goal behind his crimes. He was trying to teach people something. 

Carnage just *really loves* killin’ dudes.&&You know what? You're probably going to be right about this, and I'll look back at this moment and realize how wrong I was, but I kind of disagree.

I actually like the idea of Venom getting his own standalone first. I personally want to see a fully fledged out Eddie Brock the prson given an origin and show how he becomes the infamous Venom, instead of being shoehorned into a Spider-Man movie in the first 15-20 minutes. Venom as a character on its own is a really great concept for a villain. In a pool filled with lame cinematic comic book villains, we may actually get a great one here. Who knows?

Also, I like the idea of it being a horror. That's how I would want a Venom movie to be. Not a campy superhero flick, not a comedy or typical action movie; but to start off being scary and fearful. And I like the idea of Tom Hardy in the role. If it's in good hands with any body, it would be him.

The main trepidation that I have, which would make me think you are going to be right over me is b/c this is Sony we're talking about. And we all know how bad they can be.&&I'm most likely going to be very alone with this opinion, but this is kind of one of my issues with having Spidey be so young. I mean, if they plan to have him around for a long time, then I think you're right that people may not be patient and wait 5 years before we get to all the good stuff. I want Carnage soon, but I think this movie should have been about Venom only. Carnage can come next.

I was kind of hoping for an older Peter who is right in the thick of things. He doesn't have to grow up, nor learn the ropes, nor have to be put on time-out. I want them to jump right into the meat of his best storylines.
&&I certainly feel this way. With how many reboots Spider-Man gets as well. It's starting to get irritating with the repetition. So I am certainly looking forward to carnage even if it is a little bit of a jump. &&Ayyy&&Together exclaimed: ""Pizza the Hutt!""&&WOOOAAAHHHH&&Cowabunga!&&Hmm. I'd watch this movie.&&Venom isn't part of the MCU but Sony's own Marvel verse (likely just a spideyverse).

Why? The movie's already going to be bloated with characters. Why would they introduce a pretty major concept like that in the middle of all that nonsense instead of waiting for Spider-Man 2.&&[deleted]&&Not even a couple of hours! It was only an hour and a half!&&Maybe he gets really fucked up by Thanos as we've seen in the trailers. Maybe he's severely damaged to the point that he can never be a hero again. Maybe He finds the sympiote and it repairs his injuries. Maybe he uses it to fight Thanos and help turn the tide. Maybe he lies to Stark about it and adds in a bit of a complex character twist. Shit writes itself, and would've taken the bare minimum of screen time to convey so much. Most of it could happen in the background or as a quick 10 second cut. They're such incompetent assholes.&&The rings are not ships...&&That would be great.  But I was under the impression Sony made a statement when Venom was first announced that it would not feature Spider-Man.  I could be wrong though.&&Time to find out if Sony can make a movie again.

He's almost like a slightly smaller Hulk, while the one in ""Spider-Man 3"" was...a slightly beefier Spider-Man?

I just hope they don't compromise to save on budget, but with WETA working on it, I do have hope they'll keep him large.&&Eh, now that I know for a fact that Weta is involved my hopes are...better.&&Who ironically was actually quite good in Suicide Squad...a not very good movie and him as an actor I don't can't bring myself to like.&&Usually I’d agree, but I thought Jai Courtney was perfectly fine in Suicide Squad.&&I like that none of the other Spider-Man movies have even bothered to have a JJJ on screen, because there's no way they'll compare.&&http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/967/754/94a&&Actually WETA is doing the FX for Venom. Tom hardy will also portray they character through performance capture.

And as far as the other writers go, one of them just wrote Sony's second biggest hit of the year (Jumanji). And yes I know the other one wrote ASM2 (Big letdown) and Dark Tower (Which I didn't hate), but I'm not sure how much we can blame him since those films suffered from to many cooks in the kitchen.&&I suppose. If it's an origin story though, how do they explain Venom having powers so similar to Spidey without doing the black suit storyline? I also wonder without Spider-Man what the core conflict of the film is going to be. Will it be Venom v Carnage? Or maybe some sort of internal struggle of Brock against the symbiote.&&In the comics Venom moves to San Francisco for his independent run in the '90's, so it wouldn't be super contrived.&&>blacklisted as a reporter for writing a fake newspiece

In this day and age, he'd get so many shares on Facebook.&&> Super-strength, skin tight suits, and the ability to shoot tendrils to get around town are not unique powers after all. 

This in particular, yeah.  If you tell a casual audience that some evil power glooped all over his body and made him strong and able to shoot bits of the goo around, they’re caught up.  “Oh, kind of like an evil Spiderman?  Got it.”&&I don't think I've seen one bad Hardy movie. Hopefully this trend continues with Venom.&&I haven't seen it but I always get a kick out of the poster including a 2 star review but making it look like 4 stars that the brothers are just blocking&&Sadly I let conflicting reviews deter me. I regret not giving it a try in theaters. As for his acting skills though, he has not slowed down since Inception. I know he'd been in tons of stuff before that, but I personally noticed him in 2010 and haven't stopped seeing him pop up everywhere, always in something incredible. &&How old is Cletus Cassidy? I don’t know. I think he would fit perfectly for the role. But maybe I’m just remembering his younger self . &&The same actors? Willem even looks exactly like Cletus in my opinion.

(Referring to Carnage as shown in ‘Maximum Carnage’) &&May 25. I swear to God if we don't get a trailer before the first week of February is over (Since January is already dead) I'm eating my shirt. 

Edit: I count last week as the first week of February. I rest my case good sir.&&R-Rating and being a welcome surprise of quality would definitely do even more to help. 

I know Deadpool gets some backlash on here and gets called overrated but it’s a good example of a surprise hit that CBM fans didn’t expect to be anything but garbage. &&Man, I've been waiting for Venom to get some on screen justice since I was a kid. Never considered it would somehow not be a Spider-Man movie. Right now I'm still hoping to be surprised since I somehow doubt it could be good.

Edit: Spider-Man 3 doesn't count.&&I’m still saying.... it won’t be&&Not as much as it should be. &&If Venom doesnt closely resemble what he does in the comics, i dont care how good the plot is, im going to walk out. He better be oversized as hell, terrifying as shit and a long slimy tongue. Dont artistically interpret it, jusy make a badass cg version of wat they did in the comics and youll get Marvel fans hyped.&&I will check whether you actually came back. &&I don't know. Venom and his ""children"" are quite an extensive aspect in Marvel lore for the last 30 years. Carnage, Toxin, Anti-Venom, Shriek, etc. There are certainly plenty of avenues to explore.&&That part was definitely not Topher's fault. It's a Raimi thing. If you look at the whole trilogy, no one wears there mask for more than like 2 minutes at a time. Even Goblin has to roll up those eye lenses constantly.&&Well, no one cared who he was until he did. &&Just as long as he doesn't sound like Sean Connery giving birth to Adam Sandler again.&&There's no way in hell Topher Grace had the pull to make a demand like that o Spider-Man 3. That'd be a Raimi call, andf honestly, that movie has a lot of problems, but Venom not wearing a mask all the time isn't one of them.&&Tom Hardy could be a stage actor. He has acted like a literal mad man with his dick swinging between his legs. He has acted with his fucking eyebrows in three movies, for God’s sake.

I believe someday he’ll be as respected as some of the greats, which is why I’d be fine with him “selling out” for a project I’d check out.

And check Hardy out in The Revenant. Great role.&&Is Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, or Woody Harrelson known for their social media prowess?  &&How about we just, you know, wait until it comes out before saying it’s going to be “epically bad” or otherwise. &&>Perspective, if a movie goes through production without any social media sharing by the headliners usually it sucks.

The Han Solo movie comes out in.... 3 Months...&&And it all started with Rampart&&Then you need to check out Three Billboards - I'm a fan of his work and was still surprised by how good he was.&&It’s pretty crazy how many Stephen King movies came out last year. The Dark Tower, Gerald’s Game, 1922, and It. Shame though that The Dark Tower wasn’t turned into a miniseries or something on HBO. &&My guess is... since Disney Marvel doesn't have much control over it... they are waiting to see how good and/or successful it is before making any final decision about its MCUness.  The fact that Freige says ""no"" means they likely don't have much faith in it.  They can't stop Sony from playing with their Spiderman license, but they don't want the good MCU name to potentially be sullied by a shit movie that they have no say in.

But, especially in Hollywood, everything comes down to money.  If Venom is an unexpected quality hit, Disney will see dollar signs (just by virtue of being connected to a hit property) and you'll probably see talks of Venom being part of the MCU and maybe even featuring in a future Disney film.

On the other hand, the money for Sony is firstly in getting people to think that Venom is connected to the MCU and duping them into watching it (which is why Sony claims it is connected to the MCU) based on their trust in the MCU, and then building off that popularity with an expanded Venom universe that is part of Disney's story.

Think of it this way: Sony failed to make a profitable Spiderman universe while the MCU has shot to the moon.  Sony saw all that money and finally had to give up and ride the MCU's coattails.  Their one bargaining chip was Spiderman, which enabled them to negotiate at least a small piece of the MCU profit pie.

If they can make another hit character with Venom (I know Venom is already a hit in the comics, but I mean to the general movie-going public), then they'll have another chip to dangle in front of Disney with hopes of getting more action: ""hey, remember that money you agreed to share with us for the use of Spiderman? Well we've got another character you might be interested in that could increase the draw of your MCU films...""

So the point is, Disney is skeptical, as we all are considering Sony's track record, and playing it safe, but that could change in the future...&&I think it will fit loosely in to the canon similar to Netflix’s Marvel series. As in, Venom can reference events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but not vice versa.

Possibly there will be some nods to it in Spider-Man Homecoming 2 but I can’t imagine the ties can be much more than subtle non-crucial plot call backs for fans given this is going for an R-rating.&&The writer wanted more fucking and a different structure to the movie and different dialogue but the author did not want that. If there is anyone to blame it is the original author for changing everything the writer wrote as the author had full control over the movie.&&Yes, that would've given The Dark Tower a whole new meaning&&Agreed. If you're going to turn a popular smut book into a movie, you'd may as well go for broke and make it raunchy and iconic. Now it's just Twilight for adults. Well that's what the book was but still. Have some balls and make a good movie!&&DING DiNG DING!&&That’s optimistic. 

Amy Pascal thinks it’s the beginning of the Sony Cinematic Universe. There won’t be enough faces to palm when they start with the setups to “other movies”.

I just hope Tom Hardy’s next project is worth it and this thing loses enough money that Sony backs off the Spider-Properties.

I mean I hope it’s great because who doesn’t love a great movie and who doesn’t love Tom Hardy. But sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh.&&Like Roger Rabbit &&Wait that's deadpool&&Nothing is really funny when  everyone is too busy cleaning up the dead lol.&&Both really.

Would you ever see The Joker going on a mass murder spree by selecting random victims from the telephone book?  Because that's what Carnage did.&&Not really. He wants to scare people. But it's no fun to him if there's no one left to be scared&&Which one?&&Wow, the companies are more cooperative with eachother than the fans are...&&.....Batman vs. The Hulk??&&Yeah its happened all the time, with various results.

Best ones imo weren't even marvel/dc..... they were the batman/judge dredd crossovers (I also kinda liked the batman/spawn one even though McFarlane couldn't draw Bats for shit).

&&PETEZUH&&I know, that is why it is so frustrating, it is going to be Catwoman all over again.&&Unless Venom performs well enough at the box office that Sony and Marvel decide to go ahead and bring him in.

I'm not saying it's very likely, especially considering Venom is aiming for an R rating...but it's fun to hope.&&God I wish Marvel could just buy back everything Spidey from Sony. I believe that’s the last of the Marvel franchises they don’t own?&&This is perfect, but Disney/Marvel Studios don't have the film rights to Venom. He is exclusively a Sony character, so as great as this idea is, it can't happen.&&Wow, so this is Marvel fans' bar for incompetence?

-a jealous DC fan&&https://www.cbr.com/venom-tom-holland-spider-man-peter-parker/

yeah, not as spider-man, as peter parker.&&They Feige and Amy somethingorother did interviews together about Spider-Man. Feige looked genuinely uncomfortable, especially because Amy would go off on tangents trying to make it seem as if the MCU is connected to Sony when it's not. 


They're using the MCU's success as a weapon to confuse the movies they're trying to make now (Venom) into being in the MCU. &&No way they don't already have a design nailed and a 3D model of the suit at this point. Wouldn't be surprised if they dropped a teaser shot of a closeup of his mouth & tongue before we get a full reveal.&&Of course they have something already. Every bit of time from the start of the project would have been used.&&Why? Guardians of the Galaxy had a trailer before they had even finished shooting the movie.

These days, CGI work begins BEFORE a frame of footage is shot. The Venom Suit would likely have been preliminarily finalised before they even started shooting.&&I like venom the size of Bane in TDKR. I always think overly big characters look goofy, which is why carnage will always be my number 1. all the positives of venom but on a sharp demon lookin dude

edit: I don't want venom as small as carnage, that's boring. around banes size or slightly bigger is fine, what I hate is hulk sized venom (or more recently bigger than hulk) &&That has gotta be one of the best casting decisions in a movie ever. He is probably the single best translation of a character from comic book/ cartoon/ to screen. It's like they peeled him directly off the pages and into the movie. The looks, the voice, every part of his character was just spot on to how I remember JJ in the Spiderman cartoon as a kid, and the comics.

&&They could just get JK Simmons back, he has said that he would be happy to do it. He even voiced JJ in the 2012-2015 cartoon.&&JK is willing to come back to the role (he voices JJ in everything, he just loves playing the character), but I don't think anyone really has plans.

I'll suggest mayo or Frank's you sauce to lube it down for entry.&&So true. Like you said before, the marketing and trailer cut are huge. Ice that cake with something that blows the audiences hair back to keep the R rating viable for comic book movies and you've got yourself a winning combo. My fingers are optimistically crossed.&&Nobody expected Deadpool to be garbage. Lets not rewrite history. Anything that has that kind of humor is bound to be a smash hit. &&honestly its pretty inconceivable that its not in a Spiderman movie to me&&Spiderman 3 is just a filler episode for that 70s show&&Did you not see Spider-Man 3?&&I will... be honest, and say that I'll have forgetten this comment chain in 20 minutes.&&I will check whether you actually came back to check.&&I mean, this has been a problem with all masked superhero movies.

It's because in the comics, their eyes are expressive. They'll grow, shrink, slant, become slits, etc. And this makes ***zero*** sense. Because masks can't move. Doubly true for metal masks (looking at you, Iron Man).

So pick a film. 1988 Batman? Yup. Ends with Keaton in his mask off. Batman Returns? Yup. Mask ripped off. Iron Man? Yup. Captain America? Yup. Steel? Yup.

It's just how it is. Gotta show the star power in addition to better emoting. 

It's why this new Spider-Man is so awesome. Because they found a way to make Spider-Man Spider-Man without having his mask ripped off all the time. Though, they still did it at the end of the film. But a whole lot less than most films. &&That isn't a Raimi thing, its a big budget movie thing. Studios hate when they cast these parts and then cover up the person's face for the majority of their screen time with a mask, so the characters are written to rarely wear them. Look at Star Wars with Ren. Look at Marvel with Iron Man. &&I've watched Tom Hardy drive a car while literally talking about cement drying for an hour and a half and *recommended* it...&&God Bronson was a great film&&He is brilliant in Peaky Blinders.

Check it out.&&Check out Hardy in Peaky Blinders if you haven't seen that. He steals every single scene he is in and is clearly having fun playing off of the other great actors in that show.&&I'm here to talk about rampart&&Does it matter? There's nothing wrong with speculation. It could be shit or it could be the greatest movie ever made, but it's not like saying it'll probably be a bad movie is going to change the outcome in any way.&&Sony doesn't have the best rack record with Spider-Man movies, what with them making two shitty Spider-Man movies and then handing off the property to Disney/Marvel to make an actually good Spider-Man movie.&&It's sony dude, I'm pretty sure they are a money laundering outfit cause of how bad their movies are, &&Ron Howard has been pretty up to sharing stuff online for this one though&&And it's also gonna be hot garbage. I'm just there for Donald Glover as Lando.&&[deleted]&&Everyone in that film did an amazing acting job, and that’s still an understatement. &&>  They can't stop Sony from playing with their Spiderman license,

We have no idea what went into the deal that Marvel Studios made with Sony. It's perfectly feasible that Marvel required story approval for any film with the Tom Holland spider-man in, as part of the deal. So sure they could stick Spider-Man in if they wanted to, but I think it's reasonably likely that Marvel has a clause in the contract saying he can't be played by Tom Holland, and that they can't use the suit design from the MCU without their approval.&&I mean, there *was* a lot of fucking in the Dark Tower series.&&Patti Cake Patti Cake&&I mean sometimes.....&&But even heath ledgers joker had a point.

Deadpool is still fox until the merger.

Jessica Jones is Disney/Marvel, but Netflix.&&Eh, the fan rivalry is kind of a myth anyway. Most people pull from both, even the ones who lean toward one or the other, and it's actually not terribly common for a writer or artist to never have worked for the other if they're working at one.

Catwoman changed every single aspect of the character. This Venom is still Eddie Brock who's a strong journalist who bonds with a black Symbiote and becomes a powerful monster called Venom&&To be fair, there are technically R-rated parts of the MCU when you count the Netflix shows. If it's a mega hit I could see them maybe being willing to use the character in another film. But I'm not betting on it.&&If Disney is willing to let dead-pool stay rated R they'd probably be willing to let other characters get rated R movies too. &&They don't have the rights to Spidey either and that happened.

http://www.scified.com/news/venom-movie-concept-art-reveals-films-alien-symbiote&&But that's what gives Venom and Carnage such a nice contrast design-wise.

Well, then, you'll be excited to find out who's playing him!&&Hopefully we'll have a decent, not-oversized Venom, considering that this is loosely adapting *Lethal Protector.*&&respectfully disagree, venom as a pencil neck geek is just wrong on so many levels it's sickening.

he's like just barely below the tick (arguably equal to, except height) in terms of insane physique in the comic books, that's how he should be in the movies as well.&&Even RDJ as Iron Man and Ledger as Joker, while fantastic, are not completely accurate. If anything they changed the comics to be more similar.



The only competition in my book is Christopher Reeve as Superman, who completely defined every mannerism the character has been portrayed with.&&He is as perfect a casting choice as Patrick Stewart was for xavier&&What I find interesting is that Sony chosed Weta over their own company Sony Pictures Imageworks.&&The best thing this movie has going for it is (obviously) the cast, the FX guys, Matthew Libatique; the cinematographer (Aronofsky's go-to guy), and possibly, maybe, the director (who did Zombieland, yes... but who also did Gangster Squad). My faith in this film is starting to cautiously grow. I mean, I'm still pretty sure it'll be dogshit but there's a little part of me thinking that it won't be that big of a dogshit...&&But it won’t be a suit without Spider-Man it’s just sentient black goo that’s what’s so confusing. &&> the film will tell Venom's origin

Without Spider-Man?  I thought Spider-Man was the whole reason Venom even exists as he does.&&I think so too, he has this subtle craziness going that is eerily scary. &&Well... Don't forget it was pretty much shelved before the leaked footage got out. When we all knew it would be good was when the promotional material was out in full force and was winning over your average movie viewer, but before we started seeing the content it was still considered a very risky film.

I dunno. I can at least think of [one example](https://i.imgur.com/RGqdRGx.gifv) where this was pulled off perfectly.&&The one comic adaptation that didnt remove a full face covering mask at all was V For Vendetta, and apparently Hugo Weaving was finding it very difficult to emote properly, especially in scenes where he just had close ups and all you could see was the mask. You can actually see him doing all these constant little head movements when you watch the film, just so it doesnt look like a mannequin on film.

The only other adaptation other than V For Vendetta to not remove the helmet was Dredd, and even that allowed some more expression with ""Chin and mouth acting"".&&Well Deapool found a way. But it will be the new standard for most of these films from now on. &&Not just there, either. Look at *Prometheus* (... if we absolutely must). Any excuse to get everyone out of their space helmets as quickly as possible (""It's air! It must be breathable!"" - never mind toxins, poisons, bacterial agents etc etc etc ...).&&That sounds amazing what was the movie called&&One if my favorites. Hardy is great. His Bane was fantastic, and I didn't really like that movie overall. &&if he ever comes back for another AMA we should all insist to only talk about and ask very detailed questions on Rampart&&Not before me!&&^This. We're allowed to not have faith in a studio and be surprised...or not surprised and our lack of faith was indeed NOT disturbing.&&Considering the box office receipts of 'Dawn of Justice', 'Suicide Squad' and 'Wonder Woman', it doesn't matter whether a film is bad or not any more to make money.&&They’ve made 5 Spider-Man movies, not all of them shitty.  Kind of silly and pessimistic to already declare Venom to be shitty. &&I thought I had every character pegged in the first 10 minutes of that flick, and couldn't have been more wrong. Such a pleasant surprise when a movie starts with what seem to be tried and true archetypes only to give them more dimension and make them into truly believable people.&&Which is irrelevant.  We don't know if if Tom is in the Venom move and he doesn't necessarily need to be there.  But Venom is, presumably, part of the Spiderman license that Sony acquired from Marvel.&&Never read the books but I shall take your word for it. You seem like an expert&&Indeed, as Batman's counterpart Joker is always on some kind of twisted crusade of his own. Also that's why Carnage isn't a particularly favored character, he's more like a rabid dog.&&He said *one* of these things is not like the others

There's also a reason I said ""theoretically possible"" and I also said ""era"" not ""right this second""&&Also, in the comics, Iron fist, Black Cat, Cloak and Dagger, Deathlock, Morbius, Firestar and Captain America all fight Carnage. It would be a nightmare to stay on cannon with all of those characters. Also, Iron Fist was bad casting in my opinion. &&I saw a guy in this comment section start a marvel shills argument. I have seen it plenty of times.&&Yeah without Spider-Man or the greater Marvel universe at large. Eddie Brock is going to need tons of rewrites and nearly changed completely since his main character arch directly involves Spider-Man. I can’t speak for quality but the catwoman comparison is fair. &&The most important part of Eddie's character is his hatred for Spider-man, and at that point in its character, it's the symbiote's most important aspect too.

If you had to summarize Eddie's character when he receives Venom in 3 words, it would be: Butthurt about Spider-man.&&Just without Spider-Man for some reason.&&The Netflix shows are so isolated that they might as well be disconnected though (for which I'm glad, because The Punisher is so much better for it).&&See, that was never actually a worry for me. Disney owns plenty of companies that produce more adult oriented material. For example, Insane Clown Posse was on a record label owned by Disney when they released The Great Malinko.

It's more about the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe being pretty firmly PG-13 as that's the tone of the universe. It would be much more likely, if Venom were to crossover into MCU at all, it would be in a PG-13 feature.&&Venom honestly needs to be R&&I wholeheartedly agree, but Sony's gonna Sony.&&After the MCU acquiring Spidey and Disney attempting to buy Fox's assets, I'd say nothing is *impossible*, but I really don't know if this is what is happening. It certainly could be the case, but once you start considering the logistics it makes less and less sense.

So, Spider-man gets the symbiote in Infinity War. He wears it through the film but somehow loses it before the end. Eddie Brock, as portrayed by Tom Hardy, manages to encounter Spider-man, comes to hate him, and then bonds with the symbiote. All within Infinity War, a movie with over 60-something characters in it. (This doesn't *have* to happen, but I can't imagine Disney/Marvel butchering their relationship by ignoring it or shoehorning it into Infinity War.)

This would also mean that Kevin Feige, Disney, and Marvel Studios are overseeing production of Venom and making sure the writing, story beats, lore, etc. fit within the MCU. They would have been doing all of this behind-the-scenes without the general public knowing.

In reality, Sony wanted a Venom movie and they're going to vaguely reference Spider-man and possibly throw in a cameo by Tom Holland. I'm not even convinced he'll even be referenced as Peter Parker or Spider-man, but the actor himself may appear in a scene so that less familiar audiences will connect the dots that Sony is hoping they connect.

I'd love to be wrong, but my understanding of these studios and the industry doesn't give me much hope.

NINJA EDIT: If Venom is R-rated like we've been told, then I feel that crushes any chance of a symbiote Spidey in IW. Sure, insiders have reported that a Disney-owned Deadpool would remain R-rated, but I can almost guarantee you that the films wouldn't have any direct connections with the greater MCU.&&I'd wager the symbiote is considered a character if not outright Venom itself. Those details were certainly nailed down in the film licensing, but I appreciate your point.&&Michael Caine!!!!!&&Marion Coutillard! &&WETA has a better track record and brand recognition, and in all honesty they probably just underbid what imageworks would’ve cost.

How about that?&&My hope is that they’re establishing venom so they can have him in a spider-man movie somewhere down the line, and his backstory and motives should be given more screen time than the usual 15-20 minutes they give to more straightforward bad guys.  Maybe they took notice of the difference between how marvel set up their characters and how dc set up theirs, and are trying to prevent a BvS situation.  Venom is complex enough that to just throw him into a movie as a cut-and-dry villain is a waste (looking at you, spider-man 3), so why not make him more sympathetic and give the eventual spidey-vs-venom movie more interesting stakes?&&Justice League was a pile of goblin cum. &&op dead confirmed&&Can I just impatiently come on someone's back?&&Remindme! 10 months ""See if these guys really do come back.""

I honestly feel like the main thing wrong with Netflix's Iron Fist was Scott Buck being the showrunner. To me, Finn Jones' acting seemed better in the Defenders and I would love to see a *Heroes for Hire* series with him teaming up with Mike Colter.

Edit: Fist, not First. Stupid auto-correct.&&Unfortunately it's still a thing when it comes to the movies for some reason, but in any of the comic book subs people will talk about both.&&Really it's essentially just two vocal minority extremes feuding over nonsense while most just don't care.  I buy Marvel and DC books, I'm a bigger DC comics fan but loathe most of the recent movies whereas I tend to care less about the Marvel books but love most (but not all) of the films.  I've been called a shill for both sides but it's just people who for some reason feel a strange loyalty to one fiercely over the other, or are so committed to their feelings on, say, the movies from one that they confuse their opinions for facts and feel the need to 'disprove' anyone who 'wrongly' believes otherwise.&&Everything about the character is a dark version of spider-man.

Otherwise you get carnage.

So how does Eddie become venom if Spidey doesn't become dark Spidey? &&Yeah it's so strange they didn't decide to wait until the Spiderman sequel to introduce Venom. But if this movie gives Venom a proper introduction and a fleshed out backstory and then Sony has him show up in Spiderman, I could see it working.&&ive heard rumors that tom holland will appear in it as Peter Parker just not as spiderman&&So they are changing the character. A venom with no Spider-Man is pointless.&&Yeah, Punisher was good but it pretty much ignored the MCU entirely. The others drop a few hints here and there - Luke Cage seemed the most connected.

They haven't introduced the symbiote. The only reason venom is venom is because it latched on to parker and inherited his Spidey powers.

Otherwise you get carnage.

So how does Eddie become venom if Spidey doesn't become dark Spidey? &&And that's all because the symbiote and Brock have relationships with spider-man and hate him for their own reasons.  The symbiote doesn't have spider-powers, it just makes it's tendrils look like webs, and has a spider symbol, because it and it's host are obsessed with spider-man.  &&Yeah, but Venom only has 'spidery' powers because the symbiote bonded with Spiderman first. Without Spiderman, there is no reason for Venom to be 'spidery'&&Sony gotta Sony dawg &&Carnage is suppose to be introduced from the reports I read.
&&By removing the cornerstone of his origin? &&Well when your executive producers have a big hardon for venom and the infatuation with lots of money with the lack of future sight, you get a rushed venom movie that doesn't build on any of your past Spider-men in exchange for a ""new take"" on the character. &&so is venom a goodie or a baddie?&&Michael Douglas.&&This is what gets me, Green Lantern wasn't good, but it also didn't ruin anything. It had the lore, it established a villian, it was a tough sell (honestly thought GotG was gonna suffer the same fate but boy was I wrong) but they survived without ruining anything about their universe.

Then they abandoned it as a potential part of their cinimatic universe. Just like Superman Returns. 

Finally Man of Steel hits and it ain't bad but i still didn't love it... but as soon as they got positive returns they go Batman v Superman: also Batman is a killer now, and this is actually a team up movie, and you know Wonder Woman and Doomsday have ""suprise"" appearances. Totally embarassing.&&Never really got into most 2000ad -stuff, but I did read most of the Dredd albums back in the 1990s. Good times.

‘The Shape of Water’ is very similar to this 2015 student short film from the Netherlands ‘The Space Between Us’. Both main characters are cleaning ladies who work in a research facility. They both fall for a fish man. Even the production design and some of the story beats are alike.,27378,7ralzo,https://youtu.be/xEIpzBPUjEo,1534,1516290904.0,,"There was a good Gizmodo article about the novelization of Shape of Water that chronicles how the film script came to be, that long predates the Space Between Us, a few excerpts:

> The idea for Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water was born on a tennis court in Iowa. **That’s where author Daniel Kraus, at the age of 15, vividly remembers coming up with the seed of a story about a creature locked in a lab and a janitor that tries to break it out.**

> Kraus carried that idea around with him for years, regularly toying with it but never finishing it, until then he had breakfast with Guillermo del Toro in Toronto, Canada. 

> Kraus, slightly embarrassed he’d shared this childhood secret with the iconic filmmaker, kept trying to drive the conversation back to Trollhunters, but del Toro wouldn’t have it. “I was like, ‘Sorry I brought that up, let’s get back to Trollhunters’ and he was like, ‘No, no, no, no, no, let’s keep talking about this,’” Kraus continued. **“So we started talking about it and he optioned that very simple, basic idea right there. Within minutes of hearing it he was like, ‘This is my next movie.’”**

> Del Toro went off to make Crimson Peak, and Kraus figured that was that. But del Toro’s enthusiasm rekindled Kraus’ interest and he finally began to fully develop the idea as a novel. Little did he know del Toro was simultaneously working on the screenplay . Eventually, the pair decided they both wanted to tell this story in their own ways: del Toro would make his movie and Kraus would write his book.

**EDIT:** http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2017/12/nothing-here-but-i-asked/

More proof that Shape of Water began development years before the Space Between Us, Del Toro even sent a journalist legal documentation proving so.&&This is basically unrelated but my roommate’s cat is in The Shape of Water. I live with a movie star!&&There was a Batman beyond episode about some ink lady and a janitor caretaker falls for her and breaks her out. I think we can just relax and realize this is a fairly common idea. Good movie, awkward sex scenes. &&Didn't Del Toro start planning the movie in 2011?&&I'd think you could probably just look at the time frame to arrive at the conclusion that it's just a coincidence.

The short was made in 2015, The Shape of Water at it's earliest showing, just going off iMDB was August 2017 in Venice.

The idea that somehow Guillermo Del Toro saw a Dutch student graduation short film in 2015, and it would surely have to have involved him seeing this short film IMMEDIATELY given the time frame, then went and wrote an entire script of his own, pitched it, got it picked up and financed, went through pre-produciton, shot it, went through post-production and had it ready to show about a year and a half later seems remarkably far-fetched.&&As an aside, is that the worst cleaning lady in the world, or what?  There are papers scattered everywhere (which she ignores) and she's running a crappy tiny vacuum cleaner on the middle of this vast concrete floor.&&'The Space Between Us' is a STUDENT FILM.  Jesus, the quality on that short was incredible.  People are really stepping up their game. I was thinking about directing my own little idea but I don’t know after watching that video. Fantastic production!! 

And only 20k views? That's such a shame. I hope the person involved is able to get a career in movie production. &&I studied at the Film Academy in Amsterdam where this short film was made. I’ve just heard they’re going to have a screening of The Shape of Water tomorrow at the Academy, followed by a Skype session with Del Torro discussing the similarities of the two films!
 
(First post ever on Reddit btw!)&&I am a screenwriter living in Hollywood, and I can tell you this happens all the time. We are not dealing with plagiarism or theft of any kind here.

We are simply dealing with the fact that similar ideas occur to similar people all the time.

 And the idea that the original director could assert some kind of privelage over the new movie is absurd and frightening.

 Imagine a world, where something that has been used before could not be used again for fear of plagiarism. A good example would be a boxing movie. Do you mean to tell me that I cannot use a broken down prize fighter with a heart of gold who suddenly gets a shot at the title? I can't have a grizzled old boxing coach who takes a chance on a guy who just needs to help. I can't have a girlfriend who  believes in the guy to the exclusion of all other evidence.

 Movies would get very boring very fast if you couldn't use anything that had been used before.

 Cases even more egregious than this get laughed out of court all the time.

&&I was going to make a comment about how it's not a terribly original concept, and that Guillermo is probably the last person in the world to steal ideas so blatantly... 

But goddamn, they're pretty fucking similar. &&I mean, del Toro basically confirmed that SoW is his 'happy ending' interpretation of 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'. Lagoon is his favourite monster movie and he said that he always wanted to see the Creature get with the girl at the end of the movie, so he did that with SoW. 

Sow is basically what Black Lagoon would be like if Julie Adams' feelings towards the Gill-Man were mutual. I'd imagine that the people behind this movie had a similar idea with the humanoid fish creature getting with the woman he desires. &&Let's be honest here: Who amongst us hasn't worked in a top secret laboratory and fallen for a fish man? That's why the movie is so great. It's a universal tale of human/fish person romance that everyone can relate to.&&Del Toro has been working on this story at least since 2011, along with co-author Daniel Kraus. 

From the article:

>“I don’t remember how it came up, exactly, but [del Toro] asked me what I was working on and for some reason I brought up this idea,” Kraus told io9. “I said ‘I’m also tinkering with this notion I’ve had forever about freaks in a lab,’ and he just lit up.”
>Kraus, slightly embarrassed he’d shared this childhood secret with the iconic filmmaker, kept trying to drive the conversation back to Trollhunters, but del Toro wouldn’t have it. “I was like, ‘Sorry I brought that up, let’s get back to Trollhunters’ and he was like, ‘No, no, no, no, no, let’s keep talking about this,’” Kraus continued. “So we started talking about it and he optioned that very simple, basic idea right there. Within minutes of hearing it he was like, ‘This is my next movie.’”

And here's Del Toro referencing that meeting with Kraus:

> Shape of Water- first birthed over a looong breakfast with @DanielDKraus in 2011. It shows next week at the Venice Film Festival.

https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/900160721769684993

Also, the idea of a romantic movie between a fish monster and a human was something Del Toro had been thinking about since watching Creature From The Black Lagoon when he was a kid. From his AMA:

>1) It started when I was 6 years old and watching Creature From The Black Lagoon and how it broke my heart that the love story didnt end well. I tried to get a romantic take on the tale through the 90's without finding a good way to do it. In 2011 (while starting Pac Rim) Daniel Krauz and I had bkfst in Toronto and he discussed his idea to set it in a secret government facility through the eyes of a janitor woman. This was the key.&&Is anyone else sick and tired of fishmen taking all our women??? &&~~I don't think anyone will notice this comment...~~^Thanks but I was reminded a lot of the French film 'Amélie'; several visual, character and musical instances. The overall color palette, a ""mute"" (shy) female protagonist , accordion music, and that flooded bathroom scene. &&Yeah but aren’t both films based on The Creature from the Black Lagoon?&&My friend made a short short horror film called The Man Who Caught A Mermaid. She tried to give Guillermo a copy at an awards night she got into, but he refused saying his next film was about a mermaid and he didn't want her to think that he'd copied her.&&ITT: A lot of people trying to create controversy against The Shape of Water and Guillermo del Toro &&If anything, it reminded me of a 1962 Soviet film ""Amphibian Man""&&[deleted]&&So del Toro says it's from 2011 with Kraus. Kraus says the same. So we need to know where Kraus and TSBU writer both came up with their ideas. Did they have breakfast together in 2010, perhaps? Are they separated twins? Did both of them date the same mermaid?&&Back in March of 2016 I was driving from Texas to Florida when I stopped at a motel for the night in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. This was one of those one-story, gravel lot, basic necessities roadside establishment most often used as a horror movie cliche. I didn't mind; those are some of my favorite places to stay. 

In the morning after, I awoke to a thick veil of misty fog covering everything. I couldn't even see the backside of my vehicle from my motel room door. Somewhere in the distance I heard the cries of ambulance and police cars responding to a scene somewhere. They echoed through the fog as if some horrific disaster occurred not just there, but everywhere. 

That night on my drive to my destination, I was mulling over a story idea in which a lonely traveler wakes up to a thick fog where Lovecraftian monsters are foraging the Earth, consuming humans. By the time I got home the story idea was pretty solid. Until I decided to check the Internet. 

Stephen King's ""The Mist"" came up on the search results. Exact same premise, slightly different beginnings. Basically the same thing I thought of. My heart broke because I grew fond of that idea in a day. However, copyright laws forbade me from going any further than an idea in my head. I decided to read it, and to my surprise thoroughly enjoyed his story. Not exactly the way I imagined it: (being stranded in a market with religious nutjobs preaching about the End Times; the ambiguous ending of the novella, etc.) 

Sometimes coincidences happen. My idea for The Mist came from a personal experience and my ignorance got the better of me. A vast majority of the stories we tell are reimaginings of older stories. Or different variations. &&Also very similar to the character from the Hellboy comicbook series Abe Sapien. It's even played by the same actor. &&Titles have same number syllables!

*confirmed*&&Just coincidence, doubt Del Toro would've even seen this movie.&&[deleted]&&I really doubt this is anything more than a weird coincidence. Shape of Water shared a lot of similarities to Guillermo's other movies, plus iirc this was a movie that he has wanted to make for a very long time.&&It's not exactly an 'original' story.

It's basically Free Willy, except she fucks Free Willy.&&Its common for two very similar movies to come out close to each other.  Either because the script was circulated long before the movie got made, or because they both just co-incidentally came to similar themes.  Usually pop culture at the time has an influence on this.

A good example is ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"".  Both came after a scare in the news that an asteroid was on a collision course towards Earth.  It was, of course, false.  It passed by harmlessly.  But they resulted in two similarly themed movies about asteroids heading towards earth.  Both movies released within a couple months of each other.

Another example is early 2000's was a really popular time for magicians.  You had David Blaine and Criss Angel both doing crazy shit.  Its easy to see how these guys would be inspiration for a lot of magician movies.  Prestige and The Illusionist both very popular magician movies released within a couple months of each other in 2006.&&Hold up... I watched the space between us and I don't remember a fish man, love triangle or any of that shit....

Edit: Turns out I was thinking about a different film with the same name: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3922818/&&The Lion King was a blatant copy of a Japanese anime.&&Let's get this out of the way: It doesn't have to be a wholly original idea to be an original work.

It's OK if someone or something inspired him. It's OK, for example, that *The Maze Runner*, as juvenile as the book and film might be, to have been heavily inspired by *The Hunger Games*. &&Apart from what's already been posted here (Film was first put into production in 2011, the co-author originally had the idea when he was 15 etc.) it's hardly suprising that stuff like this sometimes happens. There's 7billion people on this planet and we're often pulling from the same well of cultural influences.  
  
Is the idea of a secret government facility holding onto a monster original? Is the idea of a fish-man original? Is the idea of a woman falling in love with a monster original? No, no & no.  
  
If you were to combine these ideas, like they both did, and you wanted a female to fall in love with the lab-creature, well your options are kind of limited. Either it's a scientist or a cleaner. No other professions would have the extended access to the creature.&&There’s a reason for the saying “there’s nothing new under the sun”. Nice coincidence. Nothing more. &&I mean as other commenters have noted shape of water is a great film but hardly a wholly original one

It basically just does a lot of conventional things really well because Del Toro is such a good filmmaker 

I don't think it's that hard to imagine two separate people coming up with this type of idea &&Swamp Thing was a janitor too&&It is a common trope. A woman saving the beast.&&This probably has a higher production quality than anything else I've seen on Dutch TV.&&My student film was about a goth girl who got the stigmata.  
6 months later, [Stigmata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata_(film\)) opened in theatres.&&Pretty sure I had an idea about rescuing and fucking a fish person after I saw Splash. Who do I see for my check?&&So many people trying to discredit Del Toro.... very interesting.&&misleading and witholding information from the title to get clicks, fuck off&&They're both influenced by Creature from the Black Lagoon. Saying one ripped off the other is like saying Hunger Games ripped off Battle Royale when both are based on the Minotaur/Labyrinth/Theseus myth.&&I was actually wondering if The Shape of Water had been taken from this short film. It's hard to tell, people keep insisting it's not an original or fresh concept, but the trailer has so many visual similarities to the The Space Between Us. 

I had honestly just assumed that GDT had contacted the shortfilm makers.&&I tell a story every once in a while about a short film I wrote years back. I had fully scripted it; I had storyboarded most of it, and I was actively planning and preparing how to shoot it.  And Then... I saw a very a short film that was very similar to the one I was about to make.  and I mean VEEEEEERRRYY similar! It had an identical premise. A lot of the beats were the same. And some of their shot choices were the exact same choices that I had storyboarded.

Myself and that other filmmaker somehow arrived at the exact same idea and almost exact same creative choices at just about the same time. And while it sounds like a crazy coincidence, I suspect it happens all the time. We're all being bombarded with the same information and stimulations, and overall we all process that information in quite similar ways, so I think it is natural that people have the same thoughts and think of the same ideas around the same time. 

I never went on to produce that film, because that short film I saw really was most of what I had envisioned for mine, but then several years later, I saw another short film, from yet another person, that was again, almost exactly the same.&&Just the concept of using cleaning ladies, or main character falls in love with monster -- not really a ""rip off"". And as far as ""similar beats"" -- read ""Kill the cat."" Almost every movie uses the same beats. They are endemic to western culture and story telling. Take any action film and jump to 60 minutes in; there will be the most 'intense beat' of the film. From there the protagonist makes a small gain and then the antagonist makes the stakes go higher. Then this repeats with the stakes higher.

And 90% of the time a hero is an orphan (in some way).

Now taking imagery and plot development -- that could be a concern. The Lion King definitely did that from a Japanese film.&&Honestly for the first month after seeing advertisements for this I thought it was a Hellboy spinoff.  Guy in the commercials looked just like Abe. &&But did she fuck the fish monster in The Space Between Us?&&I mean, Splice came out in 2009...&&When did student films look so good?&&Honestly, sounds like the flack Cameron received from Avatar copying Fern Gully, yet Fern Gully had a similar plot to many other stories. &&Definitely some similarities, but how about the similarities of the end of 'The Space Between Us' and 'The Abyss'.  That is no criticism of anything, I was just thinking how art inspires other artists.&&Gotta check this movie out.  But I have to admit, it sounds like what Suzanne Collins was accused of with Battle Royale.  A group of kids sent to battle to the death for the amusement of television viewers in a dystopian culture.  She denied it, but would she confess to being a plagiarist if she did know?  &&Sorry, but I feel like nobody is asking the real question here...

HOW THE FUCK IS THIS A STUDENT FILM!?!?!&&[deleted]&&Yeah but the Shape of Water is actually a good film. That’s the difference &&I don't think Guillermo ripped him off but he could still sue and have a case because it is uncanny. At the same time if Del Toro sees this guys work he'll probably offer him a job. &&Sounds like the plot to the ""Old Gregg"" skit by the Mighty Boosh&&Thank you so much! This must have been what I saw. When I saw the trailer for The Shape of Water I was so sure I'd already seen the movie. I checked the IMDB trivia section and connections and whatnot and even wanted to make a post on reddit asking about it. I'm not crazy! I've been confused for months about why I felt like I saw the movie before it came out somehow.&&When I saw the Space Between Us I just assumed it was del toro doing a spec version to get people excited for the real thing&&Honestly the story is one of the least interesting things about this movie. It was the execution that made it good. The acting, the set pieces, the cinematography, etc were all top notch. &&Dam that short film was really good. &&Nope. You just want karma.&&No joke. In 2002 I started writing a fantasy book that involved a group of soldiers chasing down rebel forces in the northern part of the land and made sure they stayed on the other side of a magical wall that was built thousands of years before.  Suddenly, the soldiers, while on the other side of the wall, got killed by mysterious creatures.  

Fast-forward to 2017 where I'm reading the first GoT book for the first time (I have not seen the show) and after the first 2 chapters I'm like... ""what the crap?""  I was passing around my book in the early 2000s and I had thought maybe someone might've stole my story line.  Come to find out the first GoT book was written before I started mine...&&Sounds like the plot of the Batman beyond episode where ink escapes&&I thought the story borrowed heavily from The Iron Giant myself. &&I remember when this short came out. Eerily similar ideas. But whose to say that more than one person can't come up with the same concept? &&Sometimes two people make the same thing. It happens.&&As a student making a film for my final project, things like this scare me to death. This is so well made, and so awesome. I'm just worried mines not going to look this good.&&And aren't both kind of a gender-switched Splash?&&haven't seen The Shape of Water yet, but the whole idea of it makes me think back to Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah in Splash.&&That was fantastic, thanks for the share!&&Yeah I saw that short film, was wicked.&&And avatar is very similar to dances with wolves. &&the departed is copy of infernal affairs &&Wasn't this also the plot of Splash? Been years since I've seen it.&&Classic Case of parallel thought.&&Del Toro just re-watched Hellboy and thought ""What if Abe got laid?""&&Isn’t this just a movie about the fish man from Hell Boy?&&I was just about to post this. This [tweet](https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/900160721769684993) from Del Toro pins their first meeting at around 2011.

Like the article and people in here are saying, I think it's just likely that these people all drew influence from Creature From the Black Lagoon.&&Even before these guys, another extremely similar book was written in 1982 by Rachel Ingalls called Mrs Caliban, that no one seems to know about:  https://www.npr.org/2017/12/03/564811294/girl-meets-frog-monster-in-mrs-caliban&&This is like what happened to Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke with 2001: A Space Odyssey.&&Wow.  There couldn't have been a happier ending to this, esp when the headline makes you think thievery could be at play.&&Being the skeptic here, why should I take what Del Toro says as fact?&&If you haven't read Kraus' horror novel Rotters, about grave-robbing as a trade and tradition, it is beyond great. For corpse-driven horror fans only, it gets pretty grisly, but it's almost Dickens in scope and entertainment value &&Kind of like Clarke and Kubrick&&So for those that have read the book and movie, just how much did the two stories diverge? &&Did Kraus make this short movie? is that how people are justifying this?&&So, to confirm, the answer is it's a coincidence?&&Is that... that cat? Or one of the others?&&[The one who gets eaten?](#spoiler)&&Damn, she fucks the fishman? Pencil me in as interested.&&>awkward sex scenes

For a minute there I thought you were still talking about Batman Beyond&&There was also a GI Joe episode where Shipwreck fell in love with a mermaid. 

http://joeguide.com/summaries/memories_of_mara/part3.shtml&&Ink is the hottest supervillainess. &&Fucking janitors man. Getting all that fish puss&&Came to post this, too. Also, can we take a second to remember how fuckin dope Batman Beyond was?! Crazy nostalgia.&&Came here for this. Lol&&Pretty much all if the sex happened off screen.. &&It was a beautiful sex scene IMO.  Very poetic.&&I mean, it seems like it's just the product of multiple tropes coming together.

1.) Mermaid tales

2.) Frog Prince (see, the beast is really the best choice!) 

3.) Free the captive animal (which seems to be like a water topic? Like with Free Willy).

This is a movie that lovingly crafts a great experience out of a fairly conventional set of generic impulses. It's good because of how well it pulls off its ideas, not how original any of the ideas are. I mean, aren't most of the characters really fairly typical stereotypes?

Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't give two shits about who has an idea first (except, ya know, cases of actual theft where people are financially impacted). Execution matters way more to me than how original the idea was. &&Inque in Batman Beyond! [Man what a good show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBRC5Q-xjbY). That's one of the most memorable episodes. &&According to Wikipedia, yeah.&&he did. that is the official movie.  he is claimed to have loved the fishman/ Creature from teh lagoon since he was a kid. 
&&> Didn't Del Toro start planning the movie in 2011?

The time machine in Back to the Future was originally a refrigerator. It is unlikely that the vision for his film is the same today as it was back then.&&Soooooo, you're saying there's a chance!

This school does one 'VFX exam film' every year that the entire VFX class works on (the other 6-10 exam fiction films are more 'normal' with some VFX where needed), and in 2015 this was that film. So it's not just a first year student trying stuff out.&&Is this true? That's big news. This being your first post on Reddit I mean.

No seriously though, is this actually happening? You posting on Reddit I mean.&&It's not even that it is similar ideas, it is that these tropes are very very old.  The magical fish, beauty and the beast...there are hundreds of references both intentional and unintentional in the film.

If anything it is an homage to the 60s (patriarchy/racism/chrome everything?), monster movies (black lagoon), fairy tales.  I don't think it really steals anything as much as offers up a new twist on a very old subject.&&The year after *Inception* released, I saw an independent film at SXSW where the protagonists could get into people's dreams to influence them, and the key twist was that they could go multiple levels into the dream.  
  
At the Q&A the director explained that they'd shot the film before anyone had heard of *Inception*, but that it took them a while to get funding to edit and score.  They admitted that the market for their film had been destroyed by *Inception* as no one would consider their idea unique or interesting, just a low-budget ripoff, despite them being first.  I can't find the name of this film at the moment (I'll need to dig through my SXSW film notes) and I'm not sure if it ever got distribution.&&> Do you mean to tell me that I cannot use a broken down prize fighter with a heart of gold who suddenly gets a shot at the title?

I would ask politely that you please don't.&&""Similar ideas occur to similar people all the time"" spot on, not just with scripts/stories here in Hllyd either.  I worked on a popular late night show for a couple years and I can't tell you how many times the almost exact same word for word joke got turned in for the opening monologue by the various staff and non-staff writers and comedians that contributed to the show. &&> it's not a terribly original concept

A woman falling in love with a fishman isn't an original concept?  Or just someone falling in love with something that's not human?  (Splash, Starman, Howard the Duck, etc)&&Plus Guillermo has had the same visual style for decades... you can tell his films just by looking at them. &&Guillermo was working on shape of water since 2011.  So if  you follow the timeline, its easy to defend it.  &&if anything, the Writer is the one who pitched the idea to guillermo. &&Wow the set design looks exactly the same, and some of the shots too&&The Shape of Water was being worked on *before* this student film came out.  It's an incredible coincidence.&&The Shape of Water no doubt started being written long before anyone knew about this short film&&I loved the shape of water and actually I love all Guillermo del Toro's movies.  The shape of water remind me a lot of Splash with Daryl Hanna, movie that I also loved.&&Del Toro said The Shape of Water was inspired by Creature from the Black Lagoon & Saga of the Swamp Thing. The Asset & Eliza's love story is basically Swamp Thing & Abigail's story with different set up.&&I remember reading somewhere that Guillermo got this idea from some other dude. Somebody who he collaborated on several other projects with... maybe that dude ripped off this guy.

EDIT: Daniel Kraus&&Isn't it much more likely that these people took ideas from GDT?

GDT was pitched the idea for the movie in 2011, by Kraus, who also decided to write a book version of the same idea.

Maybe these guys heard about the project that was in the works, and wanted to make  short to show off some editing, acting, set design or whatever.

It's fine if they did that, and fine if they came about this independently.&&Except his concept predates this short film. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Water_\(film\)#Production) Not to take away from the quality of the short, it's pretty fantastic. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbSAL8OKY) would count as the kind of blatant rip off people are claiming is at work here.&&There's an old Russian movie about a relationship between a woman and some kind of fish man/underwater dweller. Can't remember the name. &&He didn't steal it. He optioned it.&&Yeah, “woman loves beast” isn’t an original concept, but “cleaning lady at a research facility releases a bioluminescent fish-man, leaps into the water taking fire, and discovers she can join him in his undersea world” is a striking coincidence. The beat of the title is what catches me most, “The Shape of Water” vs “The Space Between Us”. Both have very little to do with the events of the film and are poetical. I don’t think Del Toro really stole any ideas, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find that someone who worked on a film treatment had seen this student film and been inspired.&&Yeah I mean, seriously. I expected to see the short and come back and tell people they're being silly but It's pretty damn striking. &&Right he also pointed out it's a foil to the ending of beauty and the beast

Because in BB the monster turns human instead of staying the way he was when she loved him anyways&&Probably just a coincidence, but the two main characters in The Space Between us are Juliette and Adam. Sounds similar to Julie Adams, the actress you mentioned from the Creature from the Black Lagoon.&&[deleted]&&Just for the sake of completeness, here's some discussion of the similarities between the two flims, from last summer:

http://awardswatch.com/2017/08/18/is-the-shape-of-water-cribbed-directly-from-the-short-film-the-space-between-us/                 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/6owjrw/is_the_shape_of_water_a_remake_of_this_2015_indie/

Ultimately, almost all art is derivative to varying degrees, and as a result, these sorts of coincidences happen frequently.  Which is to say, it's not that hard to believe two people would make films inspired by creature from the black lagoon within a few years of each other.  And as others have mentioned, this is actually Del Toro's 3rd movie involving a black-lagoon-inspired fish-man.&&It was very Jean Pierre Jeunet, I thought the same thing. I was reminded of delicatessen. &&First thought I had when the movie started. The color palette and aesthetics seemed very reminiscent.&&The introduction to the film, where we're getting to know her, I said to my wife ""It's like some kind of hard fantasy Amélie"".&&Just for the record... I noticed this comment.&&I immediately got an Amélie vibe!&&have you ever seen The Creature from the Black Lagoon cause apart from the creature design they're not similar at all&&I don’t understand how people can thrive on conspiracy and (many times) outrage so much.&&Which in turn is based on [the book of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian_Man) written by Alexander Beliaev way back in 1928. As far as I understand though, the plot of Del Toro's movie is different, it's just that the trope of a woman falling in love with a humanoid sea creature is quite old.&&Yep, Abe Sapien was found in a tube in an abandoned hospital/lab under Washington DC. He's taken to a government lab to be researched and ultimately vivisected, and is saved by Hellboy. del Toro co-wrote and directed the Hellboy adaptation, and also introduced Abe Sapien being unable to survive for prolonged periods outside of water.

I think it's really hard to say that del Toro was ripping anyone off by making a film about a fish man in a tube, especially with him saying he wanted to make a monster movie where the monster gets the girl, especially considering that Abe Sapien isn't able to in the Hellboy movies. The movies are pretty similar, but that's probably because they were both working off of the same material.&&Confirmation

Confirmed &&...Which was Battle Royale&&It's hilarious.  This isn't even GDT's first film about a government agency hiding a monster (one of which being stylistically very similar) in a big facility.&&))<>((&&It is hilarious how hard they are pushing this narrative.

""I dont care about any facts!""&&Glad someone else said it, first. People seem to be confusing the concepts of copying, originality, and inspiration all at the same time.&&[deleted]&&And it’s the same actor, too.&&FFS.  There is no case because GDT openly admits he started working on this script in 2011.  Way before that movie was released.&&I thought that was actually his movie, and it was just a short. I assumed people were freaking out because it's Del Tero's work, not that it was a full length movie. 
:S&&People who worry are the people who make it look good or never do it at all. People who are overconfident make the shit&&and aesthetically Shape of Water is pretty typical for Del Toro - lots of vaguely steampunk, industrial settings that you can find in Cronos (villain's industrial plant), Blade 2 (Damaskinos' lair), Hellboy 2 (Elven Court, Golden Army lair), Pacific Rim (the Shatterdome) - hell even a few parts of Crimson Peak.&&Shape of water is very similar in concept to The Amphibious Man. A novel and soviet movie filmed in Cuba &&Del Toro was supposed to do the new creature from the black lagoon with universal at one point for the new dark universe films.&&In Latin American telenovelas the staple is poor women finally marrying the rich guy. In modern feminist times of ""where are all the good men"" I don't find it weird at all that ""lonely good woman falls in love with a beast"" appears in multiple places. The beast is both humanoid and animal, a bad boy and a horse (or dog). His agency is limited, his love is pure, his desire is raw. Is a femenine fantasy for the early 21st century, the male version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. &&This is one of my favorite books of all time! [I even asked this question during the del Toro Q&A](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/77helj/hey_everyone_guillermo_here_i_wanted_the_reddit/dolzqu1/), but sadly it was buried/unanswered.&&I did not know that, but after reading-up it is pretty interesting.

Thanks :) &&Kinda, but I think Clarke had much more influence on the film than Kraus. He basically co-wrote the script.&&Similar thing happened with William Saroyan's The Human Comedy, except not amicably.&&Can someone explain? Thank you! &&My sentiments exactly...

Note:  I also liked the part where Juliette is cleaning up the blood on the dissection table/knife with the same rag she uses for everything else. The film makers were definitely shooting for a post-apocalyptic/Silent Hill video game aesthetic, but then they added .... cleaning ladies?&&That actually happens in Shape of the Water too, althou it kinda made sence there because the people there didnt really look at the cleaning staff twice&&And said room is just smack dab in one of the main hallways and isn't hidden away at all.

&&This. It clearly is a homage to 60s movies, especially monster movies. Similar villians, similar tropes, similar sets (the underground secret US research bunker), etc. The creature looks like a modern Creature from the Black Lagoon more than even Abe Sapien. &&There is an episode of Batman Beyond that has the same basic plot, down to the lab janitor.&&Paprika also came out that same year, an amazing anime film about therapists who use a machine to confront their patient's latent traumas when shit goes out of control.

There's always overlap&&lol&&In Guillermo's world, a beautiful woman falling in love with something that isn't human definitely isn't unheard of. Aside from that, his favorite movie monster is the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and he's already made a couple films that starred a fishman. 

Just doesn't seem particularly original for Guillermo - it's more like a combination of everything he loves. Which is why I want to believe this is just a really crazy coincidence. &&There's even a pretty well-known soviet book (and movie) with nearly the exact same story. 

Edit: here it is - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian_Man&&Del Toro is a fan of ""woman loves nonhuman"" concept, already used it in Hellboy - which was made up for the adaptation as it wasn't even in the comic.&&It's a twist on the beauty and the beast concept really.

It's not that it's a similar story as much as it LOOKS almost exactly the same... the lab, the mer-man with glowing bits, pushing cart down corridor etc... &&Forgetting about plagiary for a moment, people should at least acknowledge that the director of this student film deserves massive praise for making this short with such a small budget. 

Everyone acts like guys like Del Toro are singular geniuses, but this random Dutch student independently came up with the same (apparently not very original) idea, and shot it beautifully with a much smaller budget. Shouldn't he at least get credit for his accomplishment?&&Not even that incredible, both movies are a collection of established tropes. &&That doesn't necessarily mean their drafts bear any resemblance what eventually ended up on the screen.

[The first draft of ‘Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy’ involved a planeload of news anchors crashing into the mountains, discovering their plane carried monkeys and martial arts equipment, and resulted in a battle between cannibalistic newsmen and star-throwing monkeys.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7qfdl4/the_first_draft_of_anchorman_the_legend_of_ron/)&&And in SoW the woman turns monster instead of staying the way she was even though he loved her anyway.

I'd never thought of that.&&However, GDT says that The Creature from the Black Lagoon was a big inspiration for The Shape of Water. He even wanted to shoot in in black in white, but that didn't happen because it would have been too expensive.

EDIT: [source](http://www.indiewire.com/2017/11/the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-aquatic-cinematography-1201901222/)

""Although del Toro had originally planned on shooting in black-and-white, the choice would’ve been too costly, so color actually increased his budget from $16.5 million to $19.5 million.""&&Yes but it served as a jumping off point. Del Toro himself cited that film as an inspiration because he wanted to see the Gill-Man and the woman fall in love when he watched it in his youth.&&It seems like a theoretical alternate ending to The Creature From The Black Lagoon to an extent. You have a fish man worshipped as a god who has been captured by a aggressive scientist bent on taking it back to the states to be studied (based on the other male scientist from TCFTBL) who also displays a clear romantic interest in female humans and displays both animalistic aggression alongside intelligence. It’s like a what if the scientists caught the creature rather than killed it. &&You could definitely look at the plot points and background info on Strickland and the creature, and see it as almost a spiritual sequel, with certain parts of Creature reworked. It's more of an homage, but there's definitely a feeling of continuance.&&Exactly. It's totally OK, by the way. Taking an idea and creating a spinoff or allowing someone else's work to inspire you to create a new take on something is totally fine.

Plagiarizing someone's work is a much more specific and malicious theft than simply saying ""I like that idea about a 1950s swamp monster and want to do it my way.""&&ASS TO ASS.&&>The idea for Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water was born on a tennis court in Iowa. That’s where author Daniel Kraus, at the age of 15, vividly remembers coming up with the seed of a story about a creature locked in a lab and a janitor that tries to break it out.

>Kraus carried that idea around with him for years, regularly toying with it but never finishing it, until then he had breakfast with Guillermo del Toro in Toronto, Canada.

>Kraus, slightly embarrassed he’d shared this childhood secret with the iconic filmmaker, kept trying to drive the conversation back to Trollhunters, but del Toro wouldn’t have it. “I was like, ‘Sorry I brought that up, let’s get back to Trollhunters’ and he was like, ‘No, no, no, no, no, let’s keep talking about this,’” Kraus continued. “So we started talking about it and he optioned that very simple, basic idea right there. Within minutes of hearing it he was like, ‘This is my next movie.’”

>Del Toro went off to make Crimson Peak, and Kraus figured that was that. But del Toro’s enthusiasm rekindled Kraus’ interest and he finally began to fully develop the idea as a novel. Little did he know del Toro was simultaneously working on the screenplay . Eventually, the pair decided they both wanted to tell this story in their own ways: del Toro would make his movie and Kraus would write his book.

&&Cant forget Mimic, monstrous creatures living in industrial underground New York&&I thought it was a dark remake of Splash.&& Not to mention all the similarities between the Creature from Shape of Water and Abe Sapien from Hellboy. &&OH shit - he's attached to Crimson Peak? It's been languishing in my 'to see' pile for some time...  sorry, 'The End of the F****** World', you're getting bumped from next.&&I'm not sure I saw any steampunk in Shape of Water. It seemed to me more like the expected mid-century technology of the era.&&wtf Del Toro did Blade 2???&&Is crimson peak worth watching? &&Holy shit, I forgot all about those! And I've both read and seen it!&&Is the DUCU officially dead now?&&Not to belabor the obvious but Beauty and the Beast was written in 1740 and I doubt it was an original idea then.&&It's much, much older than that, even. Think Cupid and Psyche, Pasiphaë and the Minotaur, Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, Bearskin, Donkeyskin, Allerleirauh, Snow White and Rose Red, East of the Sun and West of the Moon, Pintosmalto, etc.&&I mean, like Michael Shannon showed us, men are the real monsters... &&> I don't find it weird at all that ""lonely good woman falls in love with a beast"" appears in multiple places.

See [Bear by Marion Engel](http://nationalpost.com/afterword/marian-engels-bear-reviewed-the-best-canadian-novel-of-all-time), a Reddit favourite.&&I did exactly the same, my first and only comment on Reddit was a question ignored by del Toro :’D&&If you get a chance, read the book!  It's pretty darn good, and most editions contain a forward that is like 30-50 pages on the backstory of the movie and book being developed at the same time.&&I'm familiar with the background of 2001 A Space Odyssey but I'm baffled by the apparent implication that Kubrick, Clarke, or some third party had had the idea long before the movie project -- and if that's not what they meant, I can't figure out what they *did* mean.

Kubrick got together with Clarke to make a movie; Clarke offered up several of his short stories, Kubrick picked one (plus another that influenced the opening), they worked as a team, no one else claimed credit, and that was (mostly) that.

The one interesting dispute is that Kubrick created (and edited-out) the final film to be so minimalist that it was hard to understand a number of key things, and Clarke simultaneously wrote a book that was extremely similar to the movie but had more explanatory material.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%3A_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)#Development_and_writing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)#Differences_from_the_film

There have been rumors of a falling out between the two over that, but possibly only rumors. A quick search finds this, by science fiction author Michael Moorcock:

> If Arthur was disappointed by Kubrick's decision to cut his dialogue and narrative to the bone, he was eventually reconciled by being able to put everything left out of the film into the novel, meaning that each man was able to produce his own preferred version. The success of the film ensured that the book became a bestseller, as audiences sought answers to questions raised by Kubrick's version, and Arthur soon got over his disappointment, going on to write three bestselling sequels to his novel, only one of which has been filmed so far.

Perhaps I just don't understand what the OP is saying.&&well, copyright was involved, it said that Del Toro optioned the story after hearing the basic, which means he paid the guy  money to use the idea. &&Oh damn! 😁&&the scene is narrated by David Attenborough&&I see we share similar tastes.&&does he... does he just jerk off in a riverbed?&&I felt like Dunwich and Innsmouth had bad raps.&&The short answer is it doesn't.

Yes, everyone chips in, but every film is also the work of a core team (Director/Producer/Writer/Edit/DoP + Design/VFX/Sound) with classmates and 2nd/3rd years filling in for 'lower' spots.

Each director (50% fiction/50% doc) gets his/her own movie. There is overlap (someone from producing might produce film A, but line produce film E/someone from camera might DoP film C but be a grip on documentary B) but there is a general sense of 'this core team is responsible for this film'. 

The VFX film gets their own director and producer and editor, etc, but it's their film. It was directed/written by a guy from screenwriting, and as far as I know it was even his first time doing that.&&Paprika the Anime came out in 2006, Inception came out in 2010. A live action version was being made in 2010 but due to the similarities it shared with Inception it was not produced.&&Exactly.  Not only are many ideas not actually new, just rehashed from some older lore that the general public might not remember, but even when there are new ideas, sometimes people have similar ""original"" ideas independently, at about the same time, because they are both being subconsciously influenced by the same world events.  
  
Neither case means that they ripped off each other.&&There is a video game like this called to the moon. &&I will say when I first saw the trailer it looked like a grown up Ofelia and Abe Sapien.&&> he's already made a couple films that starred a fishman.

Not only that, in Hellboy 2 the elf princess (who is quite humanoid) falls in love with Abe Sapiens the fishman. My impression when I first heard about The Shape of Water was that Del Toro decided to transform that side story into the main theme of a new movie.
&&I think I recall it being marketed as a modern day ""Beauty and the Beast"" and a NPR interview with DelToro where he says the same thing.

After watching the movie I'd say it's a pretty fair comparison even down to the villains.&&Guillermo has had his fishman in his head since he was like a kid.

Abe was supposed to be that merman?&&Was he not happy with the direction he had taken the previous films?
&&Where did you see that? As far as I know they are friends and Del Toro even has a foreword in some of the hellboy collections. Hellboy 3 didn't get made because studios didn't believe it could make money without DVD sales being as relevant anymore. The fish man was never meant to be Abe Sapien.&&[There's a book by the writer who pitched the idea coming out later this year.](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-shape-of-water-novel-does-much-much-more-than-adap-1820895586)&&IMDB puts the writer for the short as Marc S.

This is misleading. It wasn't that it would cost more to film in black and white, the studio simply offered him a larger budget if he shot it in color.

>“When it was in black and white, the budget was $12 million,” Austerberry reveals, whereas del Toro has estimated the hypothetical black-and-white budget as being closer to $16.5 million. “And then Fox Searchlight said, ‘You know, if you make it color, we’ll make it $19.6 million.’ We were struggling at even $19.6 million to get it all down, so thankfully it went that way.”

Obviously Del Toro didn't have the patience to wait around for it.&&Tale as old as time &&Beauty and the Beast is a ""modern"" retelling of Eros and Psyche which dates back to the 4th century BC. Psyche is a beautiful princess sent into the wilderness by her parents (for the crime of not finding a husband). She wanders into a beautiful castle, where a mysterious ""monster"" visits her bed when it's dark, and makes love to her (which she enjoys more and more). Eventually she sets up a trap to find out how horrible her monstrous lover is, and finds that it's actually Eros (Cupid) and he's all beautiful and mantastic.&&Beauty and the Beast though served a different purpose in 1740.   It's a fairy tale to help acclimate young girls to the idea of arranged marriage.

In the original beauty and the beast the Beast offers a bride token (reverse dowry) and the father's life for one of his daughters.  Beauty loves her father so she volunteers to be sent off to live with a large hairy stranger in a strange home.  She sends gifts back to her family and keeps them out of poverty.  Eventually she realizes that this scary new strange place is actually nice and this brutish hairy stranger is actually pretty sweet and cares for her. 

It's fine tuned to help little girls wrap their minds around the idea that soon their father will find some stranger to marry them, they'll move out to live with them and that this brave act will help her family prosper. &&Hunchback of Notre Dame, Phantom of the Opera, the frog prince-all stories of beautiful women loved by someone/something not conforming to society's version of what makes a desirable man.&&But the Beast is an intellectual, isn't he?

See, this is what happens when you don't enunciate.&&I heard that he pitched an Abe Sapien standalone film to Mike Mignola before their falling out and that instead of doing it as part of the Hellboy universe, he just went ahead and made Shape of Water. I don't know if that's true, though.&&I think Del Toro is just a gay fish.&&Parallel Synchronized Randomness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmeXE8KM0VA&&Do you mean Shape of Water? That's cool!&&But he's Mexican. Do they have leprechauns in Mexico? Are you sure he isn't just some sort of friendly chupacabra-man?&&In Arthurian legend - it's been a while so I might mess up the details - Gawain is tasked with finding what women want most. He meets a hag who agrees to tell him if he marries her. Gawain agrees and they are married. Since he fulfills his promise she gives him the choice that she can be beautiful during the day where others will see them together or at night when they are in private. He tells her its her life so she should choose which way she'd prefer to live her life. 

This was the secret to what women want - the freedom to choose for themselves. Having proven himself a worthy gentleman she is magically able to be beautiful all day.&&Avatar sort of did that? You do bring up an interesting cultural double standard though. I loved the movie, but if you flip the genders it doesn't quite work the same does it?&&Probably as u/Rumpusking mentioned, it's cultural standards. Remember that many Western tropes were established decades, if not centuries ago. Beauty and the Beast was written in the 18th century, but pulls inspiration from tales written as early as the 2nd century. 

Many stories become classics because they tap into some deep fear/anxiety in our psyche. Romeo and Juliet echoes with our societal veneration for pure, true love that transcends all else. Harry Potter is popular because it fills many children's need to belong. With Beauty and the Beast, we tap into an old fear/fixation of what makes one human.

In medieval philosophical/theological theory, the opposite of man was not woman, but animal. (Women were considered below man and thus an ""other"") You'll find many men griping about whether they were true men, or merely animals with base urges, hence the popularity of asceticism and abstinence. The Beauty/Beast trope answers this age old question, or at least provides a satisfying resolution. The Beast is physically hideous, but still a man because it can love. (And also find God but that's sort-of antiquated)    

As women can't become men, nor animals, the Handsome/Beast trope doesn't exist. Instead, women deal with the age old problem of being born into inferior bodies that are lustful and physically incapable of reaching god. (seriously) Beasts want to become men as men are perfect, but women need to tame their bodies and find god despite it. That's why in the little mermaid, the closest analogue to beauty and the beast, the poor mermaid turns into bubbles at the end. The loss of her physical body is a good thing; she has left her inferior form behind and ascended into the heavens. Hence why the beast turns into a man, and the fish turns into air and foam and light.&&[I gotchu](https://i.imgur.com/TwT4ept.jpg)&&So...a furry movie. ^^Or ^^monstergirl ^^depending ^^how ^^weeby ^^ya ^^wanna ^^get.&&Not sure about the fish face, but when it comes to human man falling in love with a very sexy nonhuman woman, we have plenty of those &&Cold Skin is basically exactly that.

&&Wait wait wait... it’s not Abe?&&[deleted]&&I believe so. It's easy to see why. The movie Hellboy is so different from Mignola's comics.

&&I haven't seen it in a long time. At the time, I really enjoyed it. Watched sequels... don't do that. They are very bad.&&Mimic is interesting. It’s worth watching, but it’s also a very compromised project.

And I think that’s why he went away from studios for his film after that. I’d recommend the commentary track on the director’s cut. It’s really good. &&Nope, but that *was* addressed in the comics.

They are talking about how when Hellboy is sighted, people start writing comics about him and Del Toro says that the comic in the movie was based on a particular type of old comic and that he really used to hate those. Mignola replies something along the lines of ""Oh? So why are you making a comic book movie then?"" and then Del Toro is surprised and mumbles something in an apologetic tone.


Awkwaaaard but makes sense, I guess.&&Hellboy 2 was a Del Toro movie that Hellboy was part of. The first flick was a Hellboy movie. I loved the first and didn’t really like the second. Hellboy deals with the supernatural but it’s much more monsters and various religious folklore. Not so much fairies and weird “monster are people, too” worlds within the world.

I dig Del Toro but I can understand why MM would be annoyed.

That isn't to say i don't like the films or that i wouldn't enjoy the original source material. 

Just from an aesthetic standpoint they seem very different and i wouldn't be surprised if this was one of the creative differences they had. 

Personally i would hav loved a cg animated form like this,

https://vimeo.com/4762452&&The two things I read are that the movies aren't really faithful to the tone of the comic, which is you know, adaptation and all, whatever.  

The big sticking point I remember is that Del Toro wanted to end Hellboy's story in the third movie, a fitting conclusion for the character, and Mignola vehemently opposed it -- he thought if he had ""an ending"" in the movie, it would undercut the comics he still wanted to write.  

It was this tough situation where he wanted to keep making comics and have the ""right"" ending for Hellboy one day in the far future, so to do it right now in a movie would either mean a) it gives away the ""right"" ending for his comic, undercutting them or b) he would have to have a different, ""worse"" ending in the movie, which nobody would want.  

Him and Del Toro couldn't agree on it, so the third movie never got made and now Mignola is doing his own route with a reboot he'll have more creative control over.&&I don't think it's been elaborated on other than Mignola saying he didn't like del Toro's idea for the 3rd movie. Based on hellboy 2 it'd be hellboy turning his back on humanity I'd imagine.&&The movies aren't really at all alike the comics.&&[deleted]&&I thought they just fucked his dad&&Yeah, what movie?&&He was actually 30-31, he just has really nice DNA.&&You are mostly right. A bulk of Hellboy is quite a bit darker. The first film, with it's many flaws, is probably tonally closer to the comic books. However, Hellboy as a comic does have some moments of levity. One of my favorite bits of comedy is the 1 page titled Pancakes from Dark Horse Presents and it's tonally light and fun like Hellboy CAN be, but that is not it's main mode. 

That being said, I like the comics and the movies for different reasons, but I could understand why Mignola would not like the representation of his IP in Hellboy 2. &&> Based on hellboy 2 it'd be hellboy turning his back on humanity I'd imagine.

that actually did happen in the comic, albeit in a different context&&I'm not super knowledgeable of the comics, but I really liked the movies, so I'm super curious what the conflict was about.&&I really can't see Del Toro making Hellboy turn his back on humanity. That's just not his style in those films. They're constantly reaffirming his humanity and the importance of that.

What I heard was just that Mignola didn't like the general feel of the world, and how it was a bit more kid-friendly and light-fantasy than he initially wanted. If Hellboy 3 was going to double down on that, I can see Mignola going somewhere else with his baby.&&",2018-01-18 10:55:04
