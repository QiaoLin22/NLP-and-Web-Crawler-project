"The movie ""The Princess Bride"" meant so much to Andre the Giant that he made his wrestling friends watch an advanced copy of the VHS with him over, and over, and over again. He'd supply dinner, drinks and sweetly asking them each time, “What did you think of the movie? Did you like my performance?”",87766,9la4am,https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-documentary/,2026,1538642722.0,,"Hulk Hogan: Is this a kissing movie?&&Andre the Giant was such a sweetheart. 

Sad the condition that made him so famous was also responsible for his short lifespan&&Cary Elwes did [an interview with ABC News last year ](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/princess-bride-turns-30-cary-elwes-shares-stories/story?id=49990697) to commemorate the 30th anniversary of *The Princess Bride* which included my favorite story about filming with Andre the Giant:

> During the shoot, which Elwes said lasted for about a month-and-a-half, the cast and crew grew very close. ""I can't remember a day without laughter,"" he said. Reiner acted as the father of the group, hosting dinners for the cast and encouraging game nights and other hang outs. One indication that the group was going to jell came on the first day, Elwes said, when wrestler André the Giant, who played Fezzik in the movie, ""let out a 16 second fart and brought production to a standstill."" ""It could be heard three counties away,"" Elwes said with a laugh. ""Nobody said anything except Rob, who said 'Are you OK, André?' and André replied, 'I am now boss.' He was comfortable enough to do that!""

Count off 16 seconds - now imagine farting that long. &&Andre the Giant has always seemed like a really cool dude. His performance in the movie is spot on, wich not many wrestler can boast of.&&[deleted]&&Can you imagine a bunch of large dudes who beat the shit out each other during the day all crammed into a room eating snacks and watching the princess bride - Hogan asking Andre to pass the popcorn...  if only someone filmed that. 10/10would watch that over and over also.&&His performance was wonderful.  I'd take the great Andre's offer had I been his friend.  I heard that he was generous in food and drink, and never refuse his offer.&&I met a guy a few months ago who had watched The Princess Bride so many times he had memorized the whole thing. He gathered a crowd and then did A WHOLE 1 MAN SHOW OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE line for line doing every character and running around acting everything out! It was incredible! The best part was him crawling around as a swamp rat creature. &&I just watched the HBO documentary on Andre last night. In it the director of the Princess bride describes how originally he thought the Andre's acting would be the biggest problem but when they got on set it turns out that due to the pain in his knees, back and neck it was the fight scenes that Andre couldn't perform in.

They even had to drop Robin Wright into his arms on cables so there was no weight in his arms straining his back

Watch the documentary its very powerful...I was chopping onions and thats my excuse!&&It was great, Andre. Thank you. &&My favorite story from behind the scenes of 'The Princess Bride' was the fact that Wallace Shawn was afraid of heights and Andre helped him while filming the cliff scene.

>Wallace Shawn was particularly worried about the cliff-climbing sequence, due to a rather debilitating fear of heights. The actors’ portion of the stunt was done very safely, of course; the cliffs were made of rubber, Andre was raised by a forklift, and the trio he was “carrying” were sitting on a custom-made three-pronged bicycle seat. “Wally was very nervous that day that he was going to ruin the day’s shooting because of his fear of heights,” Patinkin recalls. “And there he was on this, in this Medieval ‘Snuggly’ on Andre’s stomach… and he was really quite frightened. And Andre, in his inevitable beauty, just patted him on his head, and on his back, and he said, ‘Don’t worry. I’ll take care of you.'”

Quote taken from the article found [here.](http://flavorwire.com/334262/9-things-we-learned-at-last-nights-princess-bride-reunion/8)&&The movie was based on a novel. I didn't see it mentioned yet, but the author of the novel specifically had Andre The Giant in mind as Fezzik, even before he ever knew it would become a movie. I loved the movie, and loved parts of the novel even more (it delves into the history of Fezzik, and Inigo in ways that are perfect).&&Then he would offer them peanuts.&&It's the greatest movie ever made and everyone in it is perfect.&&No, André, we didn't like your performance. 

We *loved* it. &&Not only would I gladly watch it with him, but even after the hundredth tone, I would still laugh at every joke, melt at every romantic gesture, teeter on the edge of my seat at every battle, and pump my fist in the air and cheer for opening and closing credits alike. 

For anyone else, that would get real annoying, real fast. But for Andre, it would be the easiest thing in the world for me to do. You might get one in a billion people who work as hard as Andre to make others smile, for nothing more than the satisfaction of seeing them smile. That man put every fiber of his wonderful soul into making other people happy, and as far as I'm concerned, we all owe him a debt that we will never be good enough to repay.

As you wish, Andre. &&“Why do you wear a mask? You get burned by acid?&&I haven't seen this movie, but now I want to see this movie&&Andre - ''Everybody ok for a drink? Here's my movie. Whatcha think?'

Hogan - 'This is the fifth viewing tonight!'

Andre - 'I just want to know its alright! Now I'm going to the kitchen for a snack. We'll watch it again when I get back'

Hogan - 'NO MORE RHYMING OR VIEWINGS OF THIS MOVIE. I MEAN IT!'

Andre - ....
&&I dont know why but his question makes me tear up a bit because i can hear him asking it so gently. I miss the sweet man inside the giant.&&[deleted]&&And if they said no, he'd powerslam them through the coffee table and sweetly ask again.&&I call it... Terms Of Enrampagement.

It's a working title.&&""Is it a good romance?""&&>The last time Andre was officially measured was in France in the 1960s when he was 24 years old. On this occasion, he was measured at 6’9″ (206 cm) – still, a tall height, just not quite the 7’4″ stature he was billed to be at.

They are contesting his height to be probably only 7', but his condition made him pretty much grow without end. So I wouldn't be surprised if he did get well over 7'&&Teeing up a viewing of this movie with my second child and his friends next weekend. 
My oldest who is 16 is telling my youngest who is 5 that it is the best movie ever made. 
As a 47 year old man, I cannot argue....  except for Star Wars and Indiana Jones. &&Story:

Andre would always pay for meals. Once, Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to pay while Andre wasn't looking. But before he could hand over any money he felt himself being lifted. And Andre lifted Arnold all the way out to his parked car and put him on the roof.
That is a true story.&&My dad worked a security gig at a venue Andre must have been touring at. My dad said he drank 36 beers and then passed out in the hotel lobby and he was so big there was no way to move him so they had to cover him up with blankets and let him sleep it off. Dad said he was a cool guy&&Just a big ole teddy bear. &&I finished watching a documentary on Andre yesterday, cried my eyes out over how he became a heel at the end of his career, let Hulk Hogan win at wrestlemania 3 to solidify him as the hero, and how he died alone in his hotel room shortly after his fathers death.

Poor Andre had no escape from his life due to his size, he wanted to be “normal” like everyone else to get a break, but god damn he had a good heart.

During the filming of princess bride, his health had declined that he couldn’t hold the woman, she needed to be on strings so as to not put any weight on Andre.

Rest in peace boss 😭&&This warms the hearth on a cold autum day.&&This movie means a lot to me too! &&The Princess Bride is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time.&&There's a photo of the cast 25 years later. I've always considered it a wonderful picture, very tasteful and wonderful. In the foreground is a portrait of Andre, and futher back, a portait of Peter Falk. Very nice to include their memories in the photo, but I've always wondered why Fred Savage isn't in it.

If you haven't see it: [https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/princess-bride.jpg](https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/princess-bride.jpg) &&Would anyone say...

""Andre, that was total shit.""

No, they wouldnt. &&Made me smile  :)&&I love that. I bet him getting to show the world he wasn't just this lug of a wrestler was a fantastic feeling.&&I want to see a picture of a VHS tape in Andre's hand.&&Well Andre, I loved the movie, and I loved your performance. I hope he knew that people enjoyed it.&&I'll add one more example of another member of the cast expressing affection for Andre, [an interview](https://film.avclub.com/wallace-shawn-1798216149) in which Wallace Shawn (Vizzini) was asked to describe what he remembered about *The Princess Bride."" It seems Shawn did not understand or particularly enjoy the script and had a testy relationship with Rob Reiner. However he really liked Andre. Here's the key passage.

> Wallace Shawn: You know, there’s not too much to say about it. I suppose my agent did something unusual in telling me who they really wanted. And telling me that I was the third choice. I was very, very aware that I was not the first or second choice. I mean, ordinarily, agents don’t do that, and I must admit in my case, it did make it hard for me. Because I didn’t get the sense of humor, really, didn’t understand it very well. It’s not my type of humor, so the director had to kind of coach me through everything I did.

It’s by far what I’m best known for on planet Earth. No day goes by without someone commenting on it to me. It turned out to be one of the most beloved films. People had the most astonishing response to it. Apparently by following Rob Reiner, by trying to imitate him—he would do [my lines], and then I would imitate him. And I must have done it adequately, as people compliment me on it on a daily basis.
> 
> INTERVIEWER: What was it like acting opposite Andre The Giant?
> 
> WS: Well, that, I did very much enjoy. He was marvelous. But there was something painful about his situation, because he already had lost some of his strength. Of course it was well-known that he could not live terribly long, because no one with his condition did. So it was all a bit poignant. But he was always very, very intelligent, and he was very kind to me, because I was quite afraid of certain things we had to do, and he was very, very nice to me. He was a fascinating person, because he had come from a small village in France and wanted to travel. And he quite consciously decided that in order to travel, his best option was to try to become a wrestler and that’s what he did.&&I like having my spine intact.  ""OSCAR LEVEL PERFORMANCE BRO!!""&&Saw this the other day on a different subreddit and it talked about how Andre would invite Lanny Poffo (Macho Man's brother) into his room to watch an advanced copy of his movie because he was so proud. Lanny said he loved the movie and then Andre had him watch it again...and again...and again. Apparently after 6 times on 6 different days, Lanny started hiding from Andre until he'd eventually get caught and hear ""Lanny! Where have you been? Hey you wanna come hang out in my room?"" &&That’s adorable. I can picture Dave Bautista doing that with Guardians.&&The trivia about Andre that always floors me is that he grew up next to Samuel Beckett, the insanely important (and weird) absurdist playwright. I believe Andre's father did some work on Beckett's farm house in the country. The pair took a shine to each other and I guess Andre didn't like riding the school bus, I think? Because of his size. So Beckett would drive him to school. Apparently they talked a lot about cricket.&&I like to think that this was an important project for Andre because it was something outside the spectacle of professional wrestling. During his time pro-wrestling was still very proud of it's carnival roots and Andre was often billed as a monster who would destroy anything in his path. I imagine being in a feature film and showing emotion, positive emotions, was a very important part to his self-esteem.&&This thread turned out better. The other one everyone just shit on Andre&&He did a great job in it for a non-actor.  It works.  

If you have not read ""As You Wish"" by Carey Elwes you are fucking up, bud.  It's a behind the scenes tale of the movie and it's great.  &&Is that what Archer is referring at the end of ""Placebo Effect"" when he makes them watch his movie over and over again but supplies them with food and drink everytime so it's cool?&&This makes me wish Andre were still alive.   I would stalk him and hide behind a bush and jump out and yell ""YOU WERE GREAT THE WHOLE THING WAS GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY YOU WERE GREAT.""&&I liked his acting in the movie. It was not very showy, and his character came off looking like a very lovable guy.&&It was cold while filming at least some of the movie. Andre kept Princess Buttercup actress Robin Wright warm between takes with one of his hands on her back.

Andre also said the experience meant a lot to him because people on set treated him like any other person despite his size.&&On the DVD extras, Mandy Patinkin tells an incredibly endearing story about the Cliffs of Insanity scene. Wallace Shawn (Inconceivable!) was terrified of heights and was saying to director Rob Reiner he may not be able to do the scene, getting rather worked up about it. Andre walked over to Wallace and held him in his enormous hands, and stroked him like a child saying, ""It's OK. I'll make sure you're all right. It's OK. I'll protect you."" Mandy said Wallace did the scene without any hesitation. &&My Father, who is over 6 feet and 200 lbs, told me a story about running into Andre the Giant at a hotel. He said he turned to look behind him for some reason and was suddenly staring Andre the Giant right in the face. He briefly wondered how that was possible til he realized Andre was 2 full steps below him on the staircase they were on, but still slightly taller than him. My dad said Andre's feet were so big he had to walk up the stairs sideways because his feet didn't fit on the steps if he walked straight.&&I met Mr. The  Giant one time at a bar my grandpa owned. He was really nice and the largest man I have ever seen still to this day. His hands completely enveloped man like a bag. When he held beer in his hand, it looked like it was miniature size. &&I’ve always wondered how often actors watch their own performances.&&“Is this a kissing movie, brother?”

*FTFY*&&Fun Fact: There is more kissing in the princess bride than in Hulkster's tape depicting the physical act of love. &&*Thunder Lips&&This is hilarious!&&And to think, he had not one but two opportunities to fix it. 

Quote from [the attached article](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-documentary/):

> ""Andre knew he wasn’t going to live a long life. Acromegaly, the disease located in the pituitary gland that resulted in his abnormal growth, was his blessing and curse. With the size acromegaly offered, it gave him the potential to become the giant star he ended up being – unfortunately all that fame and fortune came at a sad reality that he wouldn’t live to make it past 50. Andre tragically died of heart failure on January 27, 1993 in a Paris hotel room, alone, aged 46.
> 
> Andre had the option to potentially extend his life-span twice but refused on both occasions. The first time was in the early 70s in Japan where it was first discovered that he had acromegaly at the age of 23. He denied the treatment.
> 
> The second time the opportunity arose to reverse his acromegaly was in the 80s when his health was declining more and he was being treated for an ankle fracture.
> 
> Andre’s reason not to get operated on?
> 
> “If this is the size that God wanted me to be, I’m going to be this size.”
> 
> One decade later, sadly, Andre died days after his father’s death. He was in France to attend the funeral.""

This is only one small part of twelve in the piece. If you find some time, I highly recommend giving [the article](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-documentary/) a read. Some have said it's the best thing they've read all week!

Macho Man Randy Savage's brother Lanny Poffo also dedicated an episode to Andre the Giant this past week too on his recommended *[The Genius Cast podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-genius-cast-with-lanny-poffo)*. It's a heartwarming and hilarious listen, well worth checking out ([iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/5-andre-the-giant/id1434440731?i=1000420802348&mt=2) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/41fB6JBCrHEEekkXDZci0v?si=2hhr6QhqSDuvRqFMaxo3cA) as well as all other podcast clients)! Even if you're not a wrestling fan, [The Genius Cast podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-genius-cast-with-lanny-poffo) is worth the subscription alone for the crazy stories about his brother Randy Savage and behind the scenes details on the cartoon world of professional wrestling!&&It is sad watching his final WWF performances, it's clear he was in so much pain that he could barely stand, and normally appeared in tag matches where he spent 90% of it holding onto the ropes. But whilst he wasn't around for long, he certainly lived a remarkable life.&&There’s also this [descriptive encounter](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadspin.com/in-which-virgil-tells-the-filthiest-andre-the-giant-sto-1596581696/amp) 

> He told us the story of how Vince offered him his job with the WWE, how his partnership with Ted DiBiase came about, and tons of stories about Andre. Thanks to Virgil, I can never look at Andre the Giant the same again. He referred to Andre as the ""firehose"" and recounted a time when Andre took four chicks and ""stacked them up like a sandwich"" and went to town with his ""cock fingers."" Yes, Andre the Giant is no longer the same in my eyes. Nor are sandwiches.&&On the excellent HBO *Andre* documentary, they talk about his farts.  30 second farts where common.  Hogan said you could hear his cheeks hitting each other.  

Edit: this is my most upvoted comment on Reddit.  It’s about a fart.  &&Saw Cary at MegaCon in Orlando a couple years back promoting the book. He told so many Andre stories. One I loved was that he had a 3 wheeler he rode around set and teased Cary about wanting to ride it. After much asking Cary gave in, immediately wrecked it, broke his toe and almost could not do the epic fight scene with Inigo.&&Was he saying, ""I am ok now, boss"" or was he saying after that fart that he is now the boss?&&“Dear Cary Elwes, I’ve been wondering for some time now whether or not you are famous”&&I once farted for over 30 seconds. Nothing like an Andre fart I'm sure... But it was amazing nonetheless &&>jell&&Is it ""I am now, boss"" or ""I am the boss now!""&&Bautista can, I guess. &&Rowdy Roddy Piper was also pretty spot on in They Live

edit: Just adding this for posterity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mm4mLsCAyI&&Really?  I feel like there's a lot of successful wrestlers turned actors, which makes sense.  &&And his self-consciousness about the film is understandable. The condition he suffered from dramatically shortens lifespan, and so even more than most of us, he probably didn't expect that kind of thing to happen in what time he had. Yet, there he was, in a movie with Billy Crystal and Peter Falk, two giants in the industry, and a role that he could be proud of.
&&What's that one guy's name... The Stone? The Boulder?&&Obviously you’ve never seen Abraxas, starring Jesse “The Body” Ventura. &&The HBO doc on him was truly wonderful&&[deleted]&&Ahem... Thunder in Paradise?... Mr Nanny?...

Hulk Hogan had a decent movie career. Not an amazing actor, but he did lead some films and deserves credit.&&I do that with women too. We come back to mine and put on the greatest story ever told and crush some wine.

Am woman, am not Cary Elwes, it still works.&&I imagine youd be real stretched out after a night with that guy&&Pass the popcorn, brotha!&&Well they don't really beat the shit out of each other. They stage fight being very careful not to actually hurt each other, unless they agreed in advance to do some blood work or get hit by a prop. 

Edit: As someone suggested further down, a good way to think of it is live stunt work. If you're getting hurt you're doing it wrong, but there's still going to be some impact here and there. &&Wrestlers react to Princess bride &&Want a peanut?&&Andre kept asking everyone if they wanted a peanut. &&I read that he first tried to ""act"" and he was awful I'm rehearsal. Rob Reiner told him to just be himself and that's when he shined.&&>  I heard that he was generous in food and drink

Part of me jokingly wonders if that was just André giving his own equivalent of a single chicken nugget but, to anybody else, the equivalent of five supersized meals.&&I need to meet this dude. I've never attempted that, but the way I recite every line when I watch the film, I'm pretty sure I could do that, too. And I'm a woman, so if we paired up, we'd basically be an unstoppable force of performance. &&He could make a killing at a Ren Faire.&&Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't believe they exist. &&I volunteered for many years as a counsellor at a summer camp, and one summer I met a fellow counsellor AND a 10-year-old camper who could together recite entire scenes. For years to come after that we would randomly drop Princess Bride quotes or even launch into entire scenes. And if any other kid knew what we were referencing or, even better, could join in, they were instantly part of the ""club"".

I have even jokingly used ""Do you like The Princess Bride?"" as a litmus test for whether I'd become good friends with someone. It works surprisingly well.


&&This whole thread has me tearing up. Andre lived such a tragically awesome life. It is sad that he felt he had to drown himself in alcohol for so many years. He was one of my favorite wrestlers growing up in the 80's. So many young and awkward kids were able to have someone that they could somewhat relate to at the top of the Wrestling world. I honestly don't think there has really been another like him in the world of wrestling since his career ended.&&Yeah it’s obvious when watching the film. &&im having a weirdly emotional response to this thread and this comment made me tear up &&wow i’m sobbing &&That is beautiful, thank you for sharing. &&[deleted]&&Ah, yes, S. Morgenstern's classic tale of true love and high adventure, The Princess Bride.

Truly, an incredible work of historical fiction. Such vivid description of the fashion, economy, and geography from that time. 

I'm still a bit upset that William Goldman edited all that out in the abridged version. &&Only after their permission to rhyme had been taken away though.&&It is, I totally agree. It is also a movie that never ages. I can watch it again and again, and I don't think I'll ever get enough  &&There's no point in the movie where you think, ""oh so and so should have played this role,"" or ""oh they should done or said this different.""

It's a masterpiece. &&Agree!&&<—— Yep.&&This is one of my favorites. My daughter is six, and this is her favorite movie. We watch it at least once a week.

Apparently if the show was renewed for a second season, Sting was going to joined the cast as a regular. Now there's a wrestler that I feel could have had a good acting career had he tried.

Their bodies have got to take some serious punishment.

Edit: a word&&They actually recorded all of his lines on tape for him to listen to and study. There's a great story about the table read where Mandy Patinkin and Andre are reading lines and Mandy is in character as Inigo trying to get him to speak faster. He says ""Faster Fezzik, faster!"" a few times and still Andre is slowly reciting his lines until Mandy finally slaps him in the face and everyone just goes silent and then Andre looks at him and just sort of rises to the occasion.&&The part of Fezzig in the original novel was literally written with Andre in mind. &&Apparently while he could put away stupendous amounts of food, he normally just ate a regular portion. &&For reference, [here's him holding a can of beer.](https://cdn2.justwineapp.com/assets/article/2018/05/image.jpg)  So yeah, that's possible.  &&The alcohol was more for physical pain than emotional pain. It eased his suffering and due to his condition, his liver likely wouldn't have gone out before his heart.&&Your comment fits the motif of the Catcher in the Rye, which is one of the best selling books ever. If you have a story to tell, maybe you could become the real life inspiration for someone who is looking for their Fezzik.&&Never too late to become a stay-at-home hermit writer.&&The sunset into the holocaust cloak scene happens very abruptly, so that it's suddenly dark when it should still be sunset for the wedding. It's not clear how Inigo makes the connection between the man in black being Wesley and also in love with Buttercup to recognize his screams of agony and go find him in the Pit of Despair.

It's still the best film and in my top 3 books of all time. I've seen the film countless times and it's taken 20 years to amass all two of my critical points. Casting and dialogue is 200% perfect.&&/r/theydidthemath&&Why would Arnold drive an armoire? That seems impractical for getting around.&&Damn I didn’t even know that was in a documentary lol. Yeah my dad had all sorts of stories from his security gig. Like he had to punch the singer of The cult in the face because he was drunk and attacking a fan&&I have to find out more details, but the one thing I remember my parents telling me as a kid was that Andre was at my Uncles house (I have no idea why) and he leaned against the railing going up the steps and broke it right off.  There is allegedly a picture of the group, which I really need to find and post in r/squaredcircle for some good karma.  &&Andre the Giant was not my dad. &&Hot damm 26C° :O&&Roddy Piper (whispering over the shared popcorn): He's with the brute squad.

Jimmy Snuka (whispering back): He is the brute squad.&&Fuck you, fuck foo?&&Sounds like something a Sicilian would say..&&As someone who's never seen it, I need to find a rundown on this thing. This sounds ridiculous&&Damn, that was the only reason I bought the VHS set too... &&I once heard that because of his size, when he needed to use the restroom on long flights the attendants would just bring him a bucket. Can you imagine being the poor flight attendant who had to empty a bucketful of Andre sized shits?&&It's honestly endearing to know other wrestlers carry his backs for him.&&I've heard similar things for a lot of the greats. Hogan has been in such bad shape for so many years he can't walk the length of a concourse easily.(Bad knees, bad back, bad everything really.)&&this might make you feel better:

Andre would always pay for meals. Once, Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to pay while Andre wasn't looking. But before he could hand over any money he felt himself being lifted. And Andre lifted Arnold all the way out to his parked car and put him on the roof.

That is a true story.&&I mean, he lived his life the way he wanted to and seemed happy about it and he passed that happiness on to others. I think it's an uplifting and wholesome story.&&While it wasn't irreversible, it would have definitely added more years to Andre's life. He just didn't want to be out of the ring for an extended period of time and felt God made him that way for a reason, so he opted not to do it. A shame.

The wrestler The Big Show (Paul Wight), on the other hand, [had the procedure reversed](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/big-show-funniest-stories/). 

> From a young age, Show was a medical phenomenon, suffering from acromegaly, a hormonal syndrome which led to [Andre The Giant‘s passing in 1993](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-stories/). The condition is responsible for Big Show’s immensity just as it was for Andre’s. The difference is that Big Show stopped the progress of his acromegaly with a successful surgery on his pituitary gland in the early 1990s.
> 
> In 2011’s WWE ‘Beyond The Ring’ release, Big Show: A Giant’s World, Show opened up about his condition:
> “I figure I was about nine when I developed a tumor on my pituitary gland. It’s referred to as acromegaly. I think the statistic is that there are 177 seven-foot kids that graduate from high school each year. I was 6’2” at twelve. I really started to get freakishly big at fourteen when I was like 6’8”. I was just a machine. I ate about 14,000 calories a day. It was nothing for me in high school to eat four Big Mac’s, two fish sandwiches, two large fries and a large shake and twenty minutes later play a basketball game like nothing was wrong. I was dunking a basketball in eighth grade [and reached 7’0” tall in high school].”
> 
> Big Show continues, “I realized when I was a freshman in college that I had giantism. It really hit me right in the stomach hard, because I always thought I was just blessed. I never thought of it as an abnormality. I just thought I was just gifted with all this. As a young kid, I didn’t know. I just thought I was just stronger than all the other kids.”
> 
> Being 7-foot even, the Big Show has a tendency to be an imposing presence. To counter his incredible immensity compared to everyone else, Show has an infectious sense of humor. This is one way he has said to cope with people’s first impression of him. He often does impressions of other wrestlers backstage (on screen as well!) and it was his comedy skills which helped him move into acting. In 2010, he starred in the film Knucklehead. Big Show also appears in the movies The Waterboy and MacGruber. He has also had parts on TV shows such as Royal Pains, Burn Notice, and Psyche as well.&&No. At least his skeleton wouldn't have decreased in size (length wise) anyway. It could/would keep it from getting significantly worse though.&&Yes. That's why he didn't want to do this - it would be very embarrassing. Hovever not many know that he did changed his mind after all. In truth he faked his death, went through the treatment and now is known as Peter Dinklage.&&Big people have big guts and need big food, allowing their gut flora to make big gas for absolutely groundbreaking, speed of soundbreaking farts.&&Andre liked to drink. In either Hogan or Mankind’s biography book, Andre received a case of twelve bottles of wine to take on his flight. Between being sat and taxiing to the runway, Andre finished half the case! 

He was also known for leaving cow patty size monster shits in bathtubs and once even a bed if he couldn’t fit on the hotel’s toilet. 

30-60 beers was pretty normal few hours of drinking for him. That makes much gas.&&He was the world's biggest drinker.  By FAR.  He once drank 119 beers in 6 hours.  No joke.  He would routinely drink multiple bottles of wine and then go out to wrestle.  He drank a case of win in the back of a bus ride.  &&Most people would kill a case of beer, andre would kill a truck of beer.&&https://youtu.be/wObPiiHV4pY&&In fact, the striking manner in which he reclines on the log as Buttercup accuses him of being the Dread Pirate Roberts was directly caused by the broken toe. His casual manner in that scene has always been iconic to me, so it was amusing to read that it was essentially a fluke.&&Can you blame him? He was mostly dead all day.&&It's also a regular book&&I am the director now.&&Only if he didn't break eye contact while farting. &&Then Rob Reiner let out a 17 second fart and was the boss once again.&&“I went camping with Brasky … I’m in the back of a pickup with Bill Brasky and a live deer. Well, Brasky, he grabs the deer by the antlers, looks at it and says, ‘I’m Bill Brasky! Say it!’ Then he squeezes the deer in such a way that a sound comes out of its mouth — “Billbrasky!” It wasn’t exactly it, but it was pretty good for a deer.”&&Hell, that's high-stakes gambling after maybe 1.5-2 seconds.&&in my mind it's staying the other way&&And that episode of Psych&&Because farting never stops being funny &&[deleted]&&Shit weasels.&&Not today, thanks.&&He's a great Drax. Wish we would've seen him in Infinity War.&&He killed it in the 5mins cameo in Blade Runner 2049..&&He was also perfect as a bounty Hunter in the Riddick universe. We already knew that Diesel and Bautista had good chemistry from Guardians, though.&&Roddy piper was a extremely under appreciated actor. I think he would of found pretty great success if he left wrestling and pursued it full time.&&Tons of pro wrestlers were athletic theater nerds in highschool. Wild to think about&&Wrestling isn't a show about wrestling. Wrestling is a show about a fictional wrestling show. &&*Wrestling isn't Wrestling* is a really great video to watch on YouTube that I always like to show people who still think of it as just a fake sport.  It's pretty funny, and actually made me appreciate Triple H for once.

::edit:: if anyone is curious after that point, the Whatculture Wrestling channel is pretty entertaining for pointing out all the ridiculous things that wrestling entails. I don't even watch wrestling and I still like to watch Simon Miller enthusiastically tear into the upsides of Becky Lynch being an anti-hero or recount crazy events like the Montreal screw job. &&Its physical acting and anyone who thinks that the there is no pain in each and every match would be incorrect&&The rock started out as a star. He was paid $5mil for the scorpion king. It's a record for a Hollywood newbie.

While I am skeptical of his acting chops, it cant be denied that he is super success story. &&My favourite performance of his was him in Central Intelligence &&You got kids, maniac?&&“...and I’m all out of bubblegum.”

Rowdy Roddy Piper improvised that line on the spot.&&He made such great movies, was a hoot to read that he feels playing video games is more important now.&&Without commenting on what's harder, they are different skill sets. You do not have to be nearly as convincing to be a good wrestler. Wrestling is more like improv and it relies heavily on the suspension of disbelief.&&This is a sadder note, but you randomly reminded me of that episode of Doctor Who where The Doctor brings Van Gogh to a modern day exhibit featuring him. That’s more about the condition of depression though, but it still tugs at my heart strings &&About fighting a young blind girl""
 
""Sounds to me like you're scared, BOULDER!""

""The BOULDER is over his confliction!""

As an aside, I am so happy I can still more or less remember this &&Please please nothing so formal. Just The Governor is fine. &&I'm not sure if this is the reason why no-one's mentioning him, but I did hear this story on a podcast.  Apparently a guy was watching Wrestlemania one time with his kid, and The Rock shows up for a guest appearance.  The kid turns to his dad and says ""wow, it's cool that Dwayne Johnson showed up on a wrestling show!""

So yeah, there are people out there who don't realize The Rock was a wrestler, they only know him as an actor.&&Santa With Muscles&&Adam Sandler's joke if I recall. &&Or snapped into a Slim Jim&&“No baby oil!”&&This is why 95% of all the wrestlers who have worked with Mick Foley (Mankind) sing his praises. He was crazy with his own body but was super careful with his opponent, especially big men like the Undertaker.  


Do you know how hard it was to word that without someone thinking I had pulled a switcheroo? &&No kidding. If you get hurt or hurt someone else, at best, that means no more work until the injury is healed. There absolutely has to be mutual trust in that profession.&&That's one reason I like watching Total Diva's. It's so wild to see everyone go out and talk trash and fight, then go back behind the scenes and just hang out, hug it out after a good match, etc. They crack jokes and talk shit about their family drama with each other, and make vacation plans together because they're all actually friends.&&[deleted]&&Theres also a degree of professionalism. There are guys that arent so close or even actually hate each other in real life that still trust each other in the ring doing stunts where if something goes wrong, you could be paralyzed or even killed. &&Right. Pro wrestling is pretty much live stunt work&&Can't fake plummeting 16 feet through the announcer's table.&&This is how I always looked at it too.  With ECW, especially, you maybe can work to mitigate damage but if you jump from a 2nd or 3rd floor balcony through tables.  You're either A.) Breaking through 4-5 real tables to slow your fall to the ground or B.) You're using easy to break tables that slow you down minimally as you smash into the ground.  Practice all you want, that shits gonna hurt like fuck regardless.

Also, barbed wire around a baseball bat can't be absorbed by acting.  Mad respect for the people who go out and simulate a car crash to their bodies day in and day out.&&That's ballsy.  Imagine if he slapped you back.&&I can believe the script was written for him,   but not the original novel. The novel was published the same year Andre signed with WWF.

Either way, you'd carry his bags.  &&Sad thing is they never had a pension plan. Don't know if they do now. So these guys have to wrestle well into old age to make a living. For most of them, they have no other employment opportunities.

I met the Iron Sheik in an airport in the early 2000s and when I asked for an autograph, he pulled out 8x10s and asked me to buy them. I gladly gave him $40 for a signed glossy. &&Oh my Lord, that made me genuinely chuckle to imagine it. &&Is *that* what that movie ""My Dinner With Andre"" is about??&&The hilarious part is that Arnold was pint-sized compared to Andre, so I mean, what is he going to do? &&Please confirm /u/GovSchwarzenegger ^^^^^^^^i ^^^^^^^^love ^^^^^^^^you&&It is for the most part, but I can't help but picture that last sentence.

something about referring to his ""last name"" as just ""Show"" is funny to me.&&Fucking lol. His spot in Macgruber&&Thank you for the chuckle in this otherwise tear jerking thread.&&You are huge, that means you have huge guts.&&Also, a lot of ass. It takes time for the air to escape and it gets concentrated. Basically, Andre's ass was a perfect combination of an air compressor and flute that made magic toots.&&I'm a short man, with huge farts.

Big somewhere, I guess. &&Real answer 👆 lol&&But if big people have big guts and need big food, doesnt it stand to reason that they need big assholes? The rate of gas escape should increase commensurately with the size of Andre\`s asshole, and in that case the fart should take the same amount of time to complete. Unless everything about him is big except his asshole (which would be hilarious, and I would be sorry for the poor thing, considering the massive shits he probably took) this doesnt make any sense. 

&#x200B;&&Big beer too.  There are stories out there of Andre getting up to the 70-80 count in one evening.  I could see how that could produce some pretty impressive gas.&&It's in hogan's book. I remember because he told hogan he'd finished the wine and hogan went ""you finished the whole bottle already!?"" to which Andre replied ""no, the whole case""

His drinking was legendary. It took what would make a normal man blackout passed out drunk just to get him a buzz, and the sheer agony he was in every single second of the day meant he drank constantly just to deal with the pain. People aren't meant to be that big with the gravity of earth's, and it gets painful. In the Princess bride, when he catches someone in his arms, he had to wear back braces and the actress has to wear a wire and harness so she wasn't falling into his arms quite as fast and hard. I haven't watched that fm but I believe it was Robin Wright, a small light woman, he had to catch, and this is a guy who's job it was to chuck 250 lb guys around and lift them up on his shoulders every night. But by that point in his life he barely could wrestle any more, and spent most of the time walking around with crutches because normal walking became impossible. 

He was also by all accounts the sweetest most darling and kind man everyone who met him had ever met.&&> He was also known for leaving cow patty size monster shits in bathtubs and once even a bed if he couldn’t fit on the hotel’s toilet.

After seeing how big my 3 year old's shits are in his plastic potty I totally believe this.&&RIP Wade Boggs&&Wade Boggs, May he Rest In Peace. &&Hulk Hogan tells a story about when they were wrestling in Japan. They traveled on a bus with Andre sitting in the back. Hogan's job was to keep him supplied with beer. They'd start a trip with a case of beer and when he finished a beer Andre would throw the empty at the back of Hogan's head. Hogan learned to count the empties so he would know when to hop out and get another case before Andre ran out.&&He was the world's biggest drinker not adjusted for size. [For world's biggest drinker at normal size, I submit Bill Werberniuk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Werbeniuk#Alcohol_consumption)&&""Most people"" would kill a case of beer? You keep using that phrase, I do not think it means what you think it means. &&He was also in pain every day of his life from his giantism ( producing to much growth hormone).

He was a gentle soul, and a good man. &&TBH, some of the best things in film are a result of either ad-libbing, or someone messing up/dealing with something external. 

Like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indy shooting the guy on the bridge was a result of Harrison Ford having dysentery, and needing to cut the epic whip vs sword fight short. 

>So he drew his sword, the poor guy was a wonderful British stuntman who had practiced his sword skills for months in order to do this job, and was quite surprised by the idea that we would dispatch him in 5 minutes.

Not anymore&&And the world is all the better for it.&&I never knew that. Such a great movie.

Piper wrote his own lines when he was a pro wrestler, and had a note book full of threats and hype lines to use when he was in front of the camera.  He asked Carpenter if he could use one of them in that scene, because it seemed like it fit, that being the now famous ""I came to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I'm all out of bubble gum.""
&&Wrestling is largely about charisma and timing. And those aren't small skills in terms of performance. It's the 'star power'

It doesn't mean theyre that good as actors though. Batista prepped *really* hard before he started taking roles because he didn't want to bomb. The rocks first few movies were....Well let's just say he's come a really long way. 

Performing isn't the same thing as convincing acting. They're great performers but that doesn't always translate well especially in more subdued/quiet/dramatic roles. There's a reason a reason they tend to pursue large typically comedic roles in blockbuster movies rather than a  say an Oscar bait. 

A lot to screen actors can't do theater well and vice versa. Same with comedians. 

I'm not trying to disparage wrestlers or the fact they are just highly athletic performers and not athletes. Im just saying that I wouldn't really call it acting in any traditional sense. I think it's more like hosting and as we've seen from plenty of awards shows there are tons of really good actors who just fall flat ton their face in those kind of performances.

Super different beasts. It's impossible to say which is ""harder"" cause it depends on the person. I'm sure Cena is much more comfortable and confident as a wrestler than an actor. I'm sure Leonardo DiCaprio or Paul Rudd or whoever would find even just the skit portions of wrestling really difficult let alone the stunts.

&&I know you’re kidding, but it’s amusing to me that My Dinner With Andre starred (and was co-written in part by) Wallace Shawn, who played Vizzini in the Princess Bride alongside Andre the Giant. He’s also, in many ways, the literal opposite of Andre. Inconceivable!&&And the song “Up on the Roof” &&Yes. He doesn't show up until midway through the movie though, so don't be surprised if you don't see him at first.&&[Visual Proof. . .] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4aRtK8.jpg)&&The whole reason he decided not to have the condition taken care of is because he didn’t want to be out of the ring for the time it would take to recover. He was that passionate about his career. I spend a good chunk of my life on the road too, and after you’ve done it long enough, hotels just become like another room in your house. It’s home, it’s just in another place. I imagine for Andre that it was no different than if he had died at his actual home. 

The father’s funeral part is sad, but even with that, I like to think that he was holding on long enough for his dad to go first. Once his dad passed, I think he felt like it was ok to let go and let nature take its course.

That’s a lot of conjecture, but that’s how I like to imagine I’d play it out if I were in his shoes.&&I think it is kinda nice in a way. Like he kept on going until his father had passed. So the father would not have to attend his son's funeral.

There is actually a modern wrestler with the same disease and the same size, but modern medicine has figured out to arrest the symptoms, so this guy does not suffer from the same issues.  Unfortunately those treatments were not available when Andre was alive.&&My high school English teacher grew up next door to Andre the Giant. Apparently after her father died Andre would mow their lawn whenever he mowed his family’s. &&> People aren't meant to be that big

Yeah. Apart from all of the everyday irritations - hitting your head on things, being unable to fit in normal vehicles, you need custom clothes and beds, and so on and so forth - increasingly-agonising back problems are par for the course. And then, usually, it's your heart that gives out first.

André made it to 46. He might have lived a while longer without his gigantic alcohol intake (he would have been a lot better off consuming tons of opiates, which might also have at least extended the *time* between his titanic farts :-), but it would have been a miracle if he'd made it to 60.

I actually knew a guy who was comparable in skeletal size, if not weight, to André. He might actually have been taller. I wouldn't know which way to bet, in a fight.

He made it to 50. Heart failure.

(Poor old [Robert Wadlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow), who wasn't one of these ""born 20,000 years too late"" kinds of behemoths but was clearly still similar to them in some ways, died *terribly* early, for a totally-bullshit reason. If that bullshit hadn't happened, though, then given that there was no treatment for his pituitary hyperplasia at the time, he just would have gone on getting taller and taller and taller.

This has happened many times with different wrestlers. I can list a few that have died or have been permanently injured. Alberto Torres that took a heart punch and died three days later. Pierro Aguayo jr was killed by a dropkick from Rey Mysterio, there are videos on youtube. Droz got paralyzed for life after a powerbomb, he landed wrong due to D lo brown not doing the move correctly.

Also, his condition meant that he had no real chance of dying to liver failure before his heart gave out so he drank to numb the pain. Also because he liked booze.&&At that time he had either JUST undergone back surgery before filming, or he was preparing to because of all the pain he was in.

He really shouldn’t have survived the initial crash but he did. I was away on business and it took me two days to get back home to see him. When I walked in he was of course super excited to see me. He pulled out his motorcycle parts magazine and telling me he was going to do this and that to his bike now that it was wrecked. Had too many laughs at his expense, the usual. Once visiting hours was up I told him bye and I’d see him tomorrow, went to the motel that was across town. I forgot I had my phone on silent from being at the hospital. I woke up in the middle of the night to dozens of missed calls from my sister (his wife) and the rest of my family, I immediately called back and was told he died. I jumped into my car and rushed to the hospital only to meet the rest of my family in the hallway trying to pick up my sister and carry her out the hospital. He had developed blood clot in his leg because the hospital did not put those pressure cuffs on his legs. The clot broke loose and went in to his lungs. He suffocated. 

Like I said before, there’s no way he should have survived the initial crash. But everyone says he only survived so that him and I could say our goodbyes.

I don't know much about wrestling.  Anyhow, he also had acromegaly like Andre, but surgery in his early 20's fixed it, so he is officially cured now, but of course has retained his huge size.

It's a top movie in my family so she got quite a few reactions but the kicker was when the anesthesiologist came in and immediately started quoting the movie not even looking at the screen while he checked on the epidural. She had no idea what it was whatsoever.

Luckily my parents just had boys, so Olsenmania didn't really reach our household, but my cousins were girls and were totally into it.

My dad saw this stuff and asked them: ""Where's the third one?"". ""There's only two, they're twins"". ""Don't be silly, there's three. Mary, Kate, and Ashley.""

And in the grand tradition of dad jokes, he fully committed to this bit. For at least a year or two, whenever we'd visit our cousins and the Olsens were on (and the Olsens *would* be on), he'd swear that he could tell whenever they swapped. ""That's Mary...and that's Kate!"". And he concocted this whole plausible sounding (if you're a kid) theory that they used triplets so that one of them could always be resting for child labor purposes (which is the real reason they used twins), but that they legally had to give them all a screen credit, hence why Mary-Kate had two names. My cousins were tearing their hair out in frustration, and eventually stopped playing those tapes whenever we came over (thanks dad!) to avoid the issue.

Much time passes, and at some point in the 2000s we're having Thanksgiving dinner. During the conversation, one of my cousins mentions how infuriating that whole bit was, and asked my dad if he still insisted there were three Olsen twins. ""No, there are four.

How Disney changed Lilo & Stich after 9/11,85996,9ntutm,https://v.redd.it/oddptb5ziyr11,2258,1539438377.0,,"My girlfriend at the time was a production assistant on Men In Black II. A week before 9/11, they had been filming some of the final scenes of the movie at the WTC. In the original script, one of the towers was a secret rocket that one of the characters used to escape earth. After 9/11, it had to be changed because, you know, having one of the twin towers rumble, smoke, then blast off into space leaving a huge hole and altered NYC skyline probably wasn't going to play well in theaters.&&This is an interesting Wiki page to read:

[List of entertainment affected by 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_entertainment_affected_by_the_September_11_attacks)&&My memory is fuzzy, but I think there was an episode of Pokémon that had some resemblance to 9/11 so they pulled it off the air.&&You know what never changes? The ice cream guys disappointment, I forgot how bad I felt for him when his ice cream was ruined, I was also a chubby kid at the time of this movies release. &&Relevant and very true story:

I wrote about a half-dozen episodes of the *Lilo & Stitch* TV show, one of which was an episode that got gutted because of a natural disaster in Asia. The episode was called “Ace”, and the finale originally featured a tidal wave courtesy of one of Jumba’s other experiments, Cannonball. During production, there was a tsunami in Asia (EDIT: I think it was the 2004 tsunami that killed 200k+ in Thailand), so Disney cut the entire second half of the episode and turned it into a lame “best of” sequence like in 80’s sitcoms when they needed filler. (“Hey, remember that time when Mr. Drummond fell into the open manhole and broke his hip?” *Wavy lines followed by clip of previous show.*) It was really disappointing, because imho the finale featured one of the most sincere and touching moments in the series. Storyboards still exist of the uncut episode in its entirety, but I’ve always been sad that it was never fully produced. (EDIT: It was 1000% the right call on Disney’s part.)

[Source: Me.](https://imgur.com/fGM5Poo?s.jpg)

EDIT: Clarity and link.&&Overall the changes are pretty good, I wish it would have kept that landing gear scene though, I thought that was cool.&&Can you imagine thinking you were done with animating a film and then you wake up on September 11th and on top of all that day, you're thinking. Fuck.

edit:I never said first thought.  Not even second.  And thinking about your own life doesn't make you an asshole.&&Good change, I like the theatrical cut more anyway. I think an alien spacecraft fits the story much better.&&The cinematic version always bugged me when the spaceship grinds against the mountains. Like, those mountains are green from a distance because they are covered with trees, not grass.&&I remember how much it seemed everyone was scrambling to remove anything that the public could’ve been “too sensitive” to experience after 9/11.

Specifically, I remember in either late 2001 or early 2002, ABC was airing the movie Enemy of the State.  In the commercials for it, they would only refer to it as “Enemy”.  At that point I thought that it was getting a little ridiculous.&&My dad worked in a local cinema at the time as a manager here in the UK after 9/11 they and the distributor made a decision to push back the uk showings of “swordfish” due to the scenes of terorrism.

First time I ever remembered that happening &&Crazy how they were able to reanimate the ship and landscape and left the characters how they were without a noticable difference.
Edit: Can we appreciate things without arguing.&&Aliens part was more fun anyway.&&9/11 pretty much killed all plane hijackings in movies. At least as far as I can tell. Something like *Con Air* or *Air Force One*? Those just wouldn't fly today.&&I'm ok with this, an alien ship makes a hell of a lot more sense then a plane, plus that ship became very important for the TV show.&&I'm from NY and I think they're way too sensitive over 9/11. A lot of older movies have gone back and edited out the twin towers. Why are you trying to erase history? It doesn't make sense to me.

Edit: I agree with changing it directly after 9/11 when every one was still in shock, and also think a spaceship went better with the plot, I don't think they should erase the twin towers from all the old movies though. That seems like a win for the terrorists to me.&&I sort of liked the wheels on the building part tbh &&So OP's video is ripped straight from a Vox video, just with the Vox logo cropped out. At least credit your source

Love it.&&TBH the changed version fits the movie better&&For the confused in the thread about why this was enough to get it changed, there’s an important bit of context missing from this gif. In the full deleted scene, **Stitch hijacks an airplane** off the runway, causing the passengers to run out _screaming_. That’s when this gif picks up. It was more the hijacking part than anything that was the sore spot, not quite as much the other parts. They didn’t help either though. &&But wasn’t the fact that the island didn’t have any large city’s part of the major plot? Wasn’t that like ingrained into Stitches DNA?&&Holy shit...Disney made like every possible unfortunate parallel with this one.&&I think it makes the ice cream dude a bit more special &&It worked, no plane has crashed into new york since they changed it.&&The alien craft looks cooler anyways&&Yeah I don't even feel like that's a knee jerk reaction, that feels like a pretty reasonable omission.&&I don’t understand why every movie deleted the Towers? Like, sure, if the plot was that they get blown up, it’d be tasteless. But why omit just because? I think it’d be cool to see the towers in movies after, like seeing James Gandolfini act in a movie after he’d passed. I’ve never seen anyone question why this was done, as if survivors would be angry that they were in a movie? &&Why does almost every movie/game from the early 2000's have a cut scene involving planes crashing into buildings or the twin towers.&&If only we could experience half this video (like the sound)

  #peoplewhopostsilentgifsshouldfeelbad&&As a non American I never understood why change so much media because of 9/11 &&“In Donnie Darko, which was released a month after the attacks, parts of a plane fall from the sky. It's suggested that the darker themes of the film were responsible for its poor box office,[16] but it nonetheless went on to become a cult classic in the years following.”

Thank god they didn’t change anything&&I can remember the year or so after 9-11, any kind of peril depicted on an airplane/airport or anything having to do with a skyscraper being destroyed was being carefully censored, and I use the term ""censored"" in the nicest way possible.

What you described is pretty much is the ending of the first movie. &&> one of the towers was a secret rocket that one of the characters used to escape earth.

They stole that from GI Joe. &&I was only 4 when the attack happened. It's crazy seeing how many things were changed in the world by those two buildings.

That green piece of fuck.&&My Favorite is Dream Theater's live album, ""Live Scenes from New York"", which was released ON September 11, 2001. [The cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Scenes_from_New_York#/media/File:Dtlsfny.jpg) featured the New York City skyline (including the Twin Towers) on fire, so they took it off the shelves and re-released it with new artwork. You can find copies with the original artwork on eBay though.&&>The 2009 film Watchmen, which takes place in the mid-1980s, features the twin towers in several of the scenes. Ironically the towers are depicted as two of the only buildings still standing after a scene featuring the destruction of New York City.

 Ironic indeed.&&>The 2004 sequel film Spider-Man 2 has stock footage of the World Trade Center. It only includes the North tower and 7 World Trade Center at the left. It is unknown if it was filmed before or after 9/11.

This hurt my head. How do they not know if it was filmed before or after? &&> The 2002 TV film It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie has the Twin Towers standing in an alternate reality where an angel shows Kermit the Frog what the world would be like had he never been born.

What?&&Theres was also a scene in Gangster Squad where they shoot up a movie theatre but it was pulled after the Aurora, CO shooting.&&*A Jackie Chan film called Nosebleed, about a window washer on the WTC who foils a terrorist plot*

Damn.

* James Cameron said how a sequel to True Lies had been planned, but was cancelled after the attacks because he and the producers ""didn't think a comedy about fundamental terrorists was funny anymore"".*

Fucking damn! I loved true lies.  :/ &&I noticed the list omits books. The only instance of this I've noticed is that the *A Song of Ice and Fire* books (Game of Thrones series) published before 2001 refer to Lord Walder Frey's twin castles as ""The Twin Towers"". After 2001, they're always referred to as just ""The Twins"".&&I think Disney changing their scene is fine, but I don't like how some films had the actual towers in the background and they digitally removed them. Why? Seems weird.&&“The Trailers for the film Spider-Man were edited so a scene (not in the film) showing Spider-Man capturing a helicopter between the towers was deleted.”

Kinda want to see what that would have looked like&&Loved Sam Rami's additions to Spider-Man after 9/11.&&They missed one that’s always interested me. In Jay-Zs blueprint album in 2002 he bleeped out biggies line in his verse, “blow up like the world trade”. Biggie was referring to the van bombing in the 90s but suddenly in 2002 it adopted a much different meaning... I have a feeling Jay-z made it before 911 and then changed it, don’t think he would’ve used the verse otherwise.&&>The 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York features a scene atop the WTC, which was edited out on several television channels.

Why the fuck did they have to go back and edit a movie that took place years before the attack..?&&Why would you edit a movie that was made years before 9/11?&&The pilot episode of the X-Files spin-off ""The Lone Gunmen"" centered around an operative who tried to hijack an airplane, crash it into the Twin Towers, and blame it on terrorists.

It aired in March 2001.

At a convention a few years later, I was talking to one of the stars of the show about bummed I was that there hadn't been a DVD release (it wasn't released until 2005). He seemed to think that episode was a big part of the reason why.&&Thanks. Great read. &&>On an AMA he did on Reddit, James Cameron said how a sequel to True Lies had been planned, but was cancelled after the attacks because he and the producers ""didn't think a comedy about fundamental terrorists was funny anymore"".

He must have never seen Four Lions. That movie was hilarious. &&Thank you for linking this page.

I really don't understand why shows/movies that were created prior to 9/11 but are shown years after have to still be edited. The list includes so many edits that seemingly don't make much sense. It seems like some of the editing that was done is/was excessive... &&>To keep up with the constant flow of information, many news networks began running continuous updates in the form of a news ticker that crawled along the bottom of the screen, which soon became a permanent feature of many networks.

that's pretty harsh. why the fuck does Kermit the Frog not being born stop a group of radical (mostly) saudi arabians from flying two airliners into our towers, killing thousands, including themselves? fuck you kermit.&&I imagine there might also be a similar list of movies affected by Columbine, I catch that alot on IMDb about horror movies and etc.&&I found this one the most interesting.

*The 2008 film Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa contains a segment when the animals arrive in New York City, and the original World Trade Center twin towers are seen in the distance.*

Anyone have any idea why? The movie was released in 2008...&&The Tentacruel one, because a giant jellyfish destroying a building is the EXACT SAME as a plane.&&Is it the one where Team Rocket hijacks a plane, paints it to look like Meowth, and suicide crashes it into Nurse Joy's hospital? &&Another episode that was always skipped due to 9/11, at least on Cartoon Network, was Tower of Terror. The one where Ash ""catches"" the Haunter he uses to defeat Sabrina. It was skipped just because of the title.

That one always annoyed me as a kid. The CN run would get up to the Sabrina episodes, skip that one, and leave this giant gap where Ash just suddenly has Haunter.&&They also temporarily banned the episode ""The Tower of Terror"" which is where Ash befriends a Haunter. 

In the original American airing, it goes directly from Ash losing his friends to Sabrina to suddenly being able to beat her with a pokemon that hadn't been seen before.

The whole arc is kinda dark for pokemon, Sabrina talks through a doll, she turns people who lose to her into dolls because she's bored, Ash befriends a ghost type by literally dying.&&I associate Pokémon with 9/11 because I was watching it that morning before school when my mom came in crying and changed the tv to the news. &&He was my favorite.  IIRC, his ice cream got ruined in every episode of the TV show, too.  Like the Lilo and Stich version of the cabbage merchant.&&I think the final cut makes it even sadder to.

Awesome work child me is very greatful!&&Surprised. It would’ve made just as much sense on a curved mountain side&&Animation industry as a whole got fucked. Some cartoons had to be redone to edit out scenes that could bring back memories of 9/11, or were all together cut. For example Transformers RiD, had some episodes edited and then others totally cut, because of skyscrapers being attacked.


Or an episode of Friends had to be re-done, because of a bomb joke.


Post-9/11 America was hell for media for the first few years. I mean look at the Dixie Chicks, they insulted Bush and were banned from the radio. America literally lost its shit. And media companies responded with heavy censorship(ClearChannel for instance). 


&&A lot of directors probably had the same thought on September 11th. Like they had to change some scenes in the first Spider-Man movie because they featured the twin towers. &&I would think a lot of people woke up on 9/11 had thoughts along those lines...

The week before 911 they had an episode that features a joke about a bomb in an airport. Unsure if was a week or a month, ect, but it was around the time. Very close.&&I agree it's an overall positive change, but I feel like the ""attempting to purchase stuff from an airline magazine while beingshot at"" gag would have been excellent. &&There's a point where Lilo says they live on an island with no large cities, so you're absolutely right.&&except for how it doesnt make sense why Pleakley and Jumba have a ship thats like 20 times the size of Gantu’s&&Yeah and flying through the jungle feels more realistic for this story&&I agree overall, although I did *really* like the part where the jet did a wallslide on the building to turn. &&I feel like the Hawaiian mountains were a good change, but that the heroes working together to pilot a human airplane while running from an alien spaceship would've worked better thematically.&&Not exactly...

And if anyone reading this does not know who Dream Theater is, check out their song ""Sacrificed Sons"" it's about 9/11. &&After reading your comment, I read your username as LabrieJamesHarden and was thoroughly confused. &&a little too cheeky&&That was a poor choice of words on the part of the author. I think they meant ""filmed"" as in the stock footage was added into the movie.

Basically we don't know if they added the stock footage and then 9/11 happened 

Or

9/11 happened and then decided to add the stock footage&&Read right now on Wikipedia that they built a new 7 World Trade Center after 9/11. Surely they would know from the footage if it was the old 7 World Trade Center or the new one, right?

Or, you know, by asking who filmed it.&&Kermit did 9/11&&I know right? Everyone keeps making jokes but I really want to know why ? I never saw the movie, was the angel an asshole or what?  &&And replaced with a shooting in Chinatown mixed with somebody getting strangled at their listening outpost.

Thats the only thing I can think of. Plus that movie and the original air all the damn time on tv especially during the holidays. Even to this day I see it on regularly enough.&&One of the main reason the show lost popularity was because post 9/11 ""conspiracies weren't fun anymore"" some of the directors/writers said. &&One thing to consider is that 9/11 was constantly a topic for years following. Updates were on the news constantly. The topic was everywhere and people were stressed and scared.


They may have edited it out to avoid controversy, but they may have also done it because they thought their audience would like an opportunity to get away from reality and enjoy the movie.&&Fast forward to today, movies taking place in NYC pre-2001 will now have the World Trade Center towers _digitally reinserted_ into the skyline, to be more accurate and because many of us just miss the towers now.&&I posted this higher up, but it's because film is a visual medium and every visual object communicates something.

The visuals of the Twin Towers in the aftermath of 9/11 communicates ""Hey, remember one of the deadliest terrorist attacks on U.S. soil?"" to the viewer, which is something that people who make movies might not want you to be thinking about in the middle of, say, a romantic comedy.

One of few animated films to feature a front-and-center shot of New York City's Twin Towers. *After the tragedy of 9/11, when shots of the iconic towers were being removed from many films to avoid upsetting people*, Disney opted not to attempt to edit out the towers, mostly because it would ruin the film's original main title card and because it would be too time-consuming and costly to do. By 2001, Oliver & Company had already been widely distributed on VHS, so there was no point in editing it. Many New Yorkers later commended Disney not altering the film because they felt it was a good portrayal of the way New York used to be before 9/11, and they wanted it left as it was with the towers visible&&Yeh, there's also an old Tom Clancy book, Debt of Honor, where someone flies an airliner into the Capitol building while Congress is in session. Written in 1994.

Not quite as close as the Lone Gunman episode, but still!

To be fair, there was a successful terror attack against the WTC in 1993. Successful as in, the bomb did go off but it didn't succeed in bringing down the tower as planned. So it's been known that the towers were at least a target. And clearly some people could imagine using airliners as a weapon, too.&&That’s not a prediction. They didn’t predict anything. They wrote a story that by freak coincidence is similar to events in the future. 

When Rice claims it couldn’t have foreseen it they’re trying to save the ass of the intelligence service, not claiming that no one thought or could have thought that iconic US buildings might have been attacked. &&I remember the opposite.

that's not accurate though. and it's contradictionary to the quote from the very same article. it was meant as a metaphor for ""blowing up capitalism"". and therefore using an iconic building - instead of ""just some tall building"" - was crucial to it.

Is that the book that commandos learn their military terms from? Or did you perhaps mean ""contradictory""?&&Mike Portnoy made me into the drummer I am today so I'm a pretty big fan lol. Always loved this little tidbit about 9/11 and DT. &&I think we can just conclude that the editor of the article has no idea what they’re talking about.&&On that note: The teaser trailer for the original Spider-Man involved a group of guys robbing a bank, flying away in a helicopter, and then getting caught in a giant web between the WTC. Obviously it wasn't shown anymore after 9/11, but what's interesting is that the very end features the first shot you see of Spider-Man in the suit in the film. While never confirmed, it's likely that the teaser used footage from what was supposed to be Spider-Man's big entrance into the movie, but it was cut out after 9/11, which explains why he just kinda shows up without any introduction. &&Not only that, but a scene from SM1 with the WTC *was* cut.&&Ok so I actually looked more into to myself, and watched a clip...and found this in a muppet wiki. 

""When Kermit travels to an alternate universe in the November 2002 TV movie It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, the Twin Towers can be seen outside Miss Piggy's apartment window. According to director Kirk Thatcher, their appearance was not meant to imply that Kermit is somehow responsible for the destruction of the towers, but simply ""the background cycloramas/translights that were available in Canada were more than a year old.""[1][2]"" 

So more like it was just an accident, I'd imagine people back then were upset though... those were sensitive times.  The other wiki made it sound like they added them in on purpose. &&I had it on vhs, so I had no idea it was cancelled.

"" you do realize this is 626 we are talking about, right? Do you really want to be held responsible if he escapes again?""

&&You could say it had to be a ship you can live on since they planned on being there for a while&&Yeah looked more like a research cargo vessel. Gentu's ship would likely make short work of it in a dogfight&&> since Lilo mentions there's no major cities on the island earlier in the movie.

That's a good point!&&Man you really know your 626&&I know nothing about Hawaii's islands, but since they're flying in a spaceship and a commercial airliner, couldn't they got to O'ahu in the chase?

Again, I know nothing.

From Bulbapedia:

>A Porygon made its English dub debut in a brief appearance during a graphic display in A Chansey Operation, as well as Clefairy Tales and Lights, Camera, Quack-tion.

>A Porygon made a cameo during the ""World of Pokémon"" opening narration of both Celebi: The Voice of the Forest and Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias, where it was shown floating behind a wire fence in a city. It also appeared in a shot in a ""World of Pokémon"" opening at the beginning of the clip show OVA The Journey to be a Pokémon Master Begins!!, where it was floating above a fence in a very similar location.

>It most recently appeared alongside its evolutions and all pre-Generation VI Pokémon besides Genesect in the opening sequence of Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice.&&You bastard!&&Stupid Dog! ***OOGADABOOGA!!!***&&It was Red Herring!&&Yea it happens like four times... not sure why the previous two commenters implied it was every episode. &&Avatar: The Last Airbender

Absolutely brilliant TV show.&&We’ll know in the news long before we one day don’t see him in a movie&&He's been filming a bunch of random cameos/skits that aren't even written for existing scripts.

Keep in mind holographic tupac is still out there doing concerts. &&I mean you're right, but since he was frozen he was actually 12&&It is canonically his son.&&Yeah, my mum also thought it was some weird prank pulled off by the TV station she was watching.&&Same!! Exact words. It was my mums bday too after dinner I had been napping (time difference as we were in China at the time). I didn’t understand that it was really happening, that it was something that would change the world. &&No, you can see why he ended up being caught for a crime.&&Pretty sure they said ""borderline narcissistic"" because the sister exhibits narcissistic personality but  they dont wanna call her a narcissist&&Not with that altitude&&The last flight I was on, even the pilots got high!&&I know what you meant, but man do I look forward to them selling edibles on flights.

I still think about that statue a lot, but every time I mention it to someone they have no idea what I’m talking about. I’d started to wonder if I had just imagined it.&&Slightly related, when I moved to Hawaii (I was there for a short time around 21) I was living with a friend who had been stationed there for a while. I suggested we ""take a drive to one of the other islands.""

He just sort of looked at me for a minute, and then asked ""Do you think there are bridges between the islands?""

I said ""Yeah? There were in Sim City.""&&That line could have been changed after the fact though &&I'm just buzzed on caffeine and have nothing to do right now but wiki stuff.

And my little sister used to watch Lilo and Stitch every day when she was a kid, so I picked up some things.&&Yeah, Honolulu<->Lihue, Kauai is like a 40 minute flight. &&I'm a super anxious person when it comes to unknown situations, so absolutely, lol. My fiancee, however, was dead set on going so I had no choice.

Long story short, after weaving through where you need to go, there's a security guard posted on the other side of a fence that you crawl under. We just climbed up, looked straight ahead and the guy just ignored us. Super anticlimactic. Coming down was basically the same story.

New Hellboy poster from Entertainment Weekly,65171,9kishb,https://i.redd.it/54oemzfg7mp11.jpg,2359,1538417494.0,,"Ok he looks bad ass.&&GORGEOUS poster. Tagline is eh.&&[This is from this article](https://ew.com/movies/2018/10/01/hellboy-poster-exclusive/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)

>Ever since he was first brought to Earth, all Hellboy has wanted to do is drink, hang out with his friends, and save people from monsters. Unfortunately for comic creator Mike Mignola’s demonic superhero, he was created for a much darker purpose: Ending the world. Hellboy is the prophesied Beast of the Apocalypse, whose massive Right Hand of Doom is meant to unlock the prison of a primordial demon dragon and usher in the end times. Hellboy has spent his life rebelling against this dark destiny, most noticeably by shaving his demon horns into round forehead stumps. But sometimes, he’s forced to let his demon side out a little bit.

>That’s where we find Hellboy on the new poster for his upcoming Lionsgate film, which EW can exclusively reveal here. The horns are fully grown again, and Hellboy looks ready to unleash Hell on his foes. Directed by Neil Marshall, the new Hellboy movie will star David Harbour (Stranger Things) as the big red monster hunter. The film is set to portray Hellboy’s battle against an ancient sorceress who wants revenge against humankind, so beating her might require a little more demon power than normal. Speaking to EW this March, Mignola said the film was very faithfull to a particular three-part story arc he did with artist Duncan Fegredo.

>More information on the new Hellboy will be revealed at the film’s official New York Comic Con panel this Saturday. Set for 11 a.m. ET on the Javits Center’s main stage, the panel will feature Harbour, Ian McShane (playing Hellboy’s adoptive human father Professor Bruttenholm), Daniel Dae Kim (playing the undead Marine captain Ben Daimio), Sasha Lane (playing Alice Monaghan, a human woman Hellboy once saved from fairies), and Mignola. The panel will be moderated by EW’s very own Clark Collis

>Hellboy is set to hit theaters in April 12, 2019. Check out the new poster below.
&&Hell. Yes. &&Wow somehow they made David Harbour even more attractive.&&that tag line is cringey AF&&Looks fantastic, largely because you can just feel that's an actual human being there and not a largely CGI creation.

Not a big fan of the ""legendary af"" tagline though. I know Hellboy isn't a property to take too seriously, but it just strikes me as a little too trendy.

Very excited to see more! I loved the Hellboy movies largely because I didn't really know the comics or mythology, so I loved seeing them explore this world and discover new things.&&> LEGENDARY AF.

/r/FellowKids&&[Edited out the text](https://i.imgur.com/pyw7iGQ.jpg) if anybody wants it as a wallpaper&&Really hope that ""legendary af"" text is not onnthe official poster. Looks childish and stupid af&&Helboy, like Maine Coons - is just another thing in this world that looks like Ron Perlman no matter what.&&Anyone know if Abe is going to be in it?&&Okay. I am sold. That looks awesome.&&""Legendary AF""... really though?&&Just kidding its a Tide ad&&""Legendary af""

Oof, please someone fire whoever did that. &&Lol, still looks like Ron Pearlman. Not complaining.&&I like this guy in Stranger Things, but he didnt strike me as an actiony star. Hope he does well. I Loved Pearlman. &&Legendary AF is a toe curler. Cringe. &&This is a weird moment for me because when I first saw images of the original Hellboy movie I actually felt like Hellboy looked like the actor playing him, being Ron Perlman. Now, seeing the images of the new Hellboy, portrayed by David Harbor, I STILL think it looks like Ron Perlman! 

Ron Perlman IS Hellboy!&&I was a bigger fan of [the old Right Hand of Doom](https://content.propstore.com/auction/larb/lot/rblot391/img02.jpg?_ga=2.239924939.95158246.1538420724-953143884.1538420724).  I liked the swirls, and how they went from his shoulder down onto the rounded fist.  I'm really digging everything else I'm seeing.&&Hmm did they re-title it to simply Hellboy? I remember it had some stupid subtitle when they first announced this one. &&""Legendary AF"".  Cringe.&&David Harbour as Hellboy squaring off against villain Milla Jovovich as Nimue The Blood Queen, this is defintely worth giving a chance.&&Whoever came up with Legendary AF should be fired. It’s too cringy, and it’s not gonna age well. Legendary as Hell would have been a perfect tagline if they were going for cheesy. &&whoa&&I wish Guillermo Del Toro had a chance to finish his Hellboy trilogy. The first two were stellar films and I wonder what the third would have been like.&&""Legendary AF""??? Might as well have him dab.&&Looks like he skipped leg day. Since they are hiding his getaway sticks.&&Raw me, Satan.&&https://imgur.com/T54iIcl.jpg&&They actually made the tagline Legendary AF.&&""Lenedary AF"" r/fellowkids &&Great artwork. Terrible, terrible tag line. &&Not just legendary, my dudes, it's

LEGENDARY AF 🔥😂👌💯

I'm surprised he isn't dabbing.&&Stupid tagline but looks okay.I was pretty hyped before but somewhat more cautious right now.Trailer will be interesting to see.&&""legendary af"" puke&&hot&&Sweet sassy molasses.&&Legendary Ass Fudge.&&He certainly LOOKS legendary af.&&This could surprise a lot of people by actually being really good maybe even great. I know everyone assumes the Hellboy reboot is going to suck as it is released in January, but February for a long time was also a death slot for movies and Deadpool came out in February 2016 to great reception. So maybe Hellboy is the film that will break the January movie curse. Also some are still pissed that Ron Perlman isn't Hellboy and Guillermo Del Toro isn't returning to direct. Would I love a continuation from Golden Army? Of course, but if Ron Perlman and Del Toro don't want to come back, I'll accept a reboot so long as it is well made and doesn't retread elements from Del Toro's two films. David Harbour looks perfect for the role. Plus Neil Marshall is directing the film, and he directed two of the best Game of Thrones episodes in Blackwater (S2 Ep. 9) and The Watchers on the Wall (S4 Ep. 9). He also directed The Great Red Dragon episode (S3 Ep. 8) of Hannibal. Dog Soldiers (one of his earlier feature films) is an underrated gem of a Werewolves film with solid make up and effects considering the film was made on a low budget. The Descent was a pretty solid horror film too. This film also seems to be more comic accurate and more dark like the comics were. I love the Del Toro films, but they were lighter in tone than the Hellboy comics, so they weren't a total comic accurate depiction as great as they were. So this should please more die hard Hellboy comic fans that might not have found Del Toro's two Hellboy films entirely satisfying and wanted a more dark tone. 

EDIT: It actually comes out April 12th. I am an idiot for missing that on the poster. &&I have never read Hellboy. He typically fights creatures from various mythologies, don’t he?&&[deleted]&&I’m fucking in. This looks metal af.&&Cool and all as this poster is. I would much rather see Guillermo Del Toro make the third part of his Hellboy trilogy. I really wish he was allowed finish that story. He was setting up some big stuff for it.&&I was great fan of Ron Perlman as Hellboy and was so skeptical and worried that he was gonna be replaced. But David Harbour is such a good choice.&&Am I the only one that misses Ron Perlman’s chin playing Hellboy?&&Even when Hellboy isn't played by Ron Perlman he still looks like Ron Perlman &&It looks like a cover of a Metal Album&&i keep wondering if he's gonna look more like Ron Perlman Hellboy or if they're gonna CGI him some goat feet to be more comic accurate. this poster looks more like the hellboy from the comics so here's hoping!&&Af&&Okay, this is epic&&""Legendary AF""&&Ok this is epic.&&I just wish it didn't say ""Legendary AF."" It's like the whole ""damaged"" tattoo, but thankfully not tattooed onto his face.&&His trousers are on fire :(&&Eh AF&&I'm surprised honestly. The AF screams ""fellow kids"", when they could have just gone with ""Hell. Yes."" Like the other poster said. 

It's less cringy, and works on more levels. 

Plus it's more ""hellboyish"". Hellboy doesn't give a damn about being PC, and would never say ""AF"" like that. He'd just straight up swear. &&tagline is /r/fellowkids&&Yeah, I’m not a fan of that tag line either.

[Here’s my edit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9nuRVer) that fixes it imo&&I think it’s pretty phat with the kidz, homie g dawg&&As a 20 year old who does actually use AF a lot, I cringed hard&&Yeah they lost me with that&&Fuck, I love that they're doing Storm & Fury. That means he's probably [holding Excalibur in this photo.](#spoiler)&&They're adapting The Storm and The Fury?! I honestly didn't expect that, I figured they'd go back and do Von Klempt and the Kriegaffen, maybe leading to a reintroduction of Rasputin. &&so no liz and no abe? i liked those two, especially abe...

&#x200B;

also i didnt want to read much of the story to not spoil the movie but it seems like it could be just a soft reboot really, like yeah we change some people around but stuff still happened w/e...&&I didn't realize his right hand was actually his hand. I thought it was a glove or gauntlet sort of thing. &&> Sasha Lane (playing Alice Monaghan

Is it my imagination or red heads are being slowly phased out of comic book adaptations? lol. I first noticed it with MJ but Iris on the flash series AND movie, Jimmy in Supergirl, Starfire in the new Teen Titans... thing, etc.&&While I would prefer seeing Guillermo del Toro as director, still happy that Neil Marshall will be directing this. &&Ian McShane? Fuck and yes!&&So do we get the twins or not :(&&>Ian McShane as Bruttenholm

Fuck. Yes. &&Much better tagline&&How the hell they missed this during their tagline brainstorming sessions.&&Hell? Yes. &&I had a huge crush on Ron Perlman's Hellboy, so it's safe to say I'll have one with Harbour's too.&&I'm gonna miss Perlman.&&Who'da thunk all you had to do was paint the guy red and give him some horns. &&He went from Dad bod to rad bod. &&Holy shit! That's the sheriff from Stranger Things? He looks fucking massive here.&&It’s the red skin and horns. Trust me. &&Any time I see AF in the wild, I just pretend that it is short for ass fuck.

Legendary Ass Fuck.&&/r/FellowKids fodder&&Seems very internet/social media youth pandering.&&Embrace. Your. Inner. Anti-hero.&&This is the world the internet, Reddit and social media made for itself.  &&> Not a big fan of the ""legendary af"" tagline though

Same.  

Especially because they could have gone with something like ""Legendary as Hell,"" and conveyed roughly the same sentiment without the trendy twitter lingo and included a little double entendre in there.&&It’s very r/fellowkids&&Season 3 of preacher had a similar tagline ""powerful AF"". But I think it works in the context of that show since it does poke a lot of fun at culture and pop culture, it fits the in your face style of the show. Little that I know and seen of Hellboy, I can see it fit with the character as well.&&That AF gave me douche chills, no lie. &&Trendy things tend not to age well, either.&&> Not a big fan of the ""legendary af""

Lucky for us, the people who make the movies aren't the same people who make the advertising.&&It's the fact that ""af""  was trendy a few years ago that's really making it notably awkward.

&&> Not a big fan of the ""legendary af"" tagline though.

yikes yeah i missed that first time, that's embarrassing and needs to go. &&Damn, didn't even notice that tagline at first. Definitely some r/fellowkids shit right there. &&Epic AF😎😎😎&&I assumed the AF must have stood for something else because ""legendary as fuck"" is cringey as fuck for a tagline.&&Was looking for someone to do this. Looks awesome 👍&&Thanks&&The official poster will say ""totally lit!""&&How do you do, /r/FellowKids/ ?&&Whenever I see Deathstroke or read his dialogue, I always hear it in Pearlman's voice. I can't imagine it any other way lol&&I read somewhere that he's not going to be in the first reboot film.&&He's too big of a star after the success of Shape of Water, he's not returning Hellboys calls&&No indication. This better make tons of money and start a cinematic universe though, with abe.&&Okay, this is epic. Alexa, play Red Right Hand by Pete Yorn.&&PR people: we need something that the kids will relate to.
Cody the intern: legendary af?
PR people: BRILLIANT &&No, fire the person who signed off on it.&&Right?? I was thinking the same. I guess it’s hard **not** to make Hellboy look like Pearlman &&I personally love it when actors step outside their comfort zone. It gives them a chance to surprise people with a range maybe we didn't know they had and we end up with gems we didn't expect like stranger than fiction.&&Kelsey Grammer did OK as Beast.&&Yeah seems so. Before it had the subtitle Rise of the Blood Queen I believe. &&""All hellboy breaks loose."" Where hell is huge and boy is small. You could even have a secondary poster where the ""breaks loose"" is only on that, having the villain or one of hellboys allies facing the opposite direction. People would buy them lol

 ""We've all got demons"" 

I mean, while corny, at least it's better than that memeshit. Hellboy would not approve of that "" AF "" tagline and we all know it. Whatever though I'm sure the movie will be great regardless. &&[Accurate af](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/34300000/Hellboy-Animated-hellboy-34363106-1024-768.jpg)&&Hellboys legs have been drawn tiny since day one, like a Satyr&&in the comics, he has tiny legs. &&Rob Liefeld must have designed this poster.&&Correct &&That's because Hellboy is, fucking metal. &&Makes me want to go listen to the DOOM soundtrack.&&Basically an Amon Amarth album art&&I'd love to see Tenacious D's ""Metal"" on this soundtrack.&&I know its david harbour playing him but I swear he looks like Ron Perlman in makeup.

&&Fun fact I always like to point out. Hellboy actually had hooves in the Ron Perlman movies. You only see him without boots on one time, in the scene from the first one where he meets John for the first time.

Edit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxH90rMTF0M&t=249s At 4:09&&This one is R-rated and pretty low-budget from my understanding, so I don’t think they’ll waste money on giving him hooves, especially since getting that to look right on camera would require Harbour to wear funky leg braces or something to get the look right, since walking on hooves would give him a totally different posture.&&>In a recent interview on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Harbour said he received no computer-generated assistance in becoming Hellboy.
“None of that’s CGI, right?” Colbert said. “None of that’s CGI?”

He may just be talking about how fit his body is but it's possible he's talking about his entire look as Hellboy. &&[That Sony email leak really killed it for me when I see things like this in films.](https://i.redditmedia.com/OuXSgpmluUyhgurChpOG9C51AQVHzTEANDqaYHJ9AK4.png?w=991&s=fae46246a64da6e54a1529c6edb30aeb) All I can see on posters or taglines is what business groups came up with these.&&As Frazier &&Right. That's how you appeal to the Hellboy crowd. Talk like a 15 year old girl did two years ago. Nevermind that everybody who goes to see this is probably a 30+ man.&&Hellboy DESTROYS demons with SWORDS and FISTS.&&Preacher did the same thing with their ""Powerful AF"" posters.

Dope poster, shitty tagline.

https://i.imgur.com/cTUYqeJ.jpg&&Having it read THE LEGENDARY or even just LEGENDARY would make it 100x better. 

(THE) LEGENDARY HELLBOY sounds like some comic badass that isn't out of place, since they all have some title like that. Incredible Hulk, Amazing Spider-Man, Invincible Iron-Man, etc. 

LEGENDARY AF HELLBOY reads like it should be a middleschooler's doodle of some muscular rectangle who eats the kids who are mean to him.&&Ding ding ding, we have a winner! &&You mean ""eh eh F"" &&Hell yes is also pretty cringy imho. They could have done without any tagline at all.&&It just screams to me ""Oh, AF is over. Gotta remember not to use that one...""&&Exactly what I was thinking. Both ""legendary"" and ""af"" have never really had a place in mass marketing. &&Could you maybe pretty please do another edit for me where you remove everything but the words hellboy? I would love to use this as my phone wallpaper and suck at photoshop.&&Definitely fixes it. &&I was thinking that as well, would be way more badass to only say LEGENDARY&&That was my first thought when’s i saw the picture. It looks a bit like it did in the comics. &&[deleted]&&Wh...why would you re-link the picture that's already in the OP?&&What's your link? It takes me to Reddit's front page, for some reason.&&From what I hear, the movie is mostly based around The Wild Hunt. &&I'm convinced ""The Shape of Water"" was Del Toro's Abe origin story, he just couldn't get the liscenceing.&&Technically it isn't, his hand was chopped off as a baby and the stone hand was welded on, it's actually the hand of the Angel (also known as Watchers) who created the Ogdru Jahad, hence why it can summon them &&To add what u/cabose7 said, the Right Hand of Doom was the hand that created the Ogdru Jahad, sealed away the Ogdru Jahad, and is the only thing that can release the Ogdru Jahad.

The prophecy was spread throughout the Earth but largely forgotten by man. None of the older races have forgotten and they know Hellboy for who and what he really is.

The Right Hand of Doom was once grafted onto a statue in the garden of an ancient king. Once black magic had come into the kingdom and when its people started worshiping an evil goddess (Hecate), it came to life and beat the shit out of everyone. Once the stone hand turned everyone to soup, the statue flung itself from a cliff and shattered on the rocks below. The Right Hand of Doom was reclaimed and placed on Hellboy.

Shit's bad luck, yo.&&do you mean from the last movie?  i was under the impression that this is not the same continuity as the del toro movies, but i haven't looked too deeply into it and could totes be wrong.&&They should have hired him for their marketing team.&&Welcome to Hell, Boy.&&Happy Cake Day!&&It's probably been used before. But still. Legendary AF? GTFO.&&He looks like Ron Perlman as Hellboy tbh.&&This still looks like Ron Perlman lol &&I have crushes on pseudo-rubber body molds too.&&When I look at this poster I see Ron Perlman ' s Hell Boy. &&You dig his big, red, rock hard...fist. &&Ron *perl*man David *harbour*

Sorry&&I will too...but he's pushing 70.  I'd rather it get passed along to a newer person than Crystal Skull it.&&I'll miss Guillermo Del Toro's hellboy in general. I really wished that the studio shelled out and let him complete the trilogy.

I have high hopes for this one from what I've seen so far, though. Hopefully it measures up.&&He was so good as Hellboy :'(&&Is he wearing a muscle suit or did he actually get that jacked?  He was kinda chubby in Stranger Things.&&And cover him in a rubber muscle suit. &&He worked out some, but most of the jacked-ness is a body suit.&&Oh man I bet Hellboy *would* give a legendary Ass Fuck 👹🍆💦🍑😍&&> Legendary Ass Fuck.

I'm down&&Me too! But also whenever I see/hear ""come on baby"" I think or say ""NO, NOT ON THE BABY!"" &&I’d let this Hellboy ass fuck me anyday.&&Exactly what it is&&> Legendary as Hell

So much better than ""Legendary Auto Focus""&&>  ""Legendary as Hell,""

I know Reddit comes up with a lot of shit when it comes to marketing, see Deadpool, but sometimes you find these nuggets that make me go WHY DIDN'T THEY GO WITH THAT

Just like Venom and ""Connect with your inner anti hero"" or whatever it was

Someone said they should have gone with ""inner demons"" and fuck that just made more sense&&*Ooooooh!*

Why aren't you on the marketing team!? That's so strong!&&God dammit that's so much better&&I feel like it was more entertainment weekly's doing than the producers'&&I mean that still sounds kind of shitty tho. Maybe thats just me but 
""Legendary"" in a movie tagline kinda sounds cheap.&&I liked someone aboves line

Or how they saw him I guess. Next thing you know, Acadamy Award and everyone ever playing the character again will be doing it in his shadow.&&Well he was a great casting for the non action side of Beast, and they did an OK job with his fighting scenes. &&There were a number of alternate titles considered, as I recall:

Hellboy: Crimson River

Hellboy: Dracula's Teabag

Hellboy: The Red Scare

Hellboy: The Lunar Curse

Hellboy: Mother Nature's Gift
&&I mean that was a story from the comics.&&He has normal legs.  For a guy with hooves.

But then: I like action set pieces set to music so there's that and then the last point wound up manifesting as both a series of rather entertaining ""weblogs"" in both the Homecoming and Civil War films as well as a social media feature in the new Spider-Man game soooo...

Fuck. I've been focus-grouped :(&&He's got it all wrong. NBD stands for Not B.D, as in B.D Wong, who the kids think is a big deal.

I think on mobile you don't see the tag and just see a hyperlink.&&No it’s more like he was always a fan of the “Creature from Black Lagoon” and wanted to make his own version of that story, and then while making Hellboy used some of his own ideas while adapting Abe. Then years later he got a chance at his sea creature movie and nobody will stop bringing up Abe Sapien, so he kinda bit himself in the ass with that one.&&Did the hand grow with him?&&Nah, you're correct. Nuala and Nuada, along with nearly everything in the second movie, were made just for the movie. There are some very small references (Wink's launching hand was originally early in the comics and was attached to a Nazi).

It sounds like this new movie has a lot more Mignola in it so expect it to be closer to the comics. The GdT movies were pretty much just del Toro monster flicks.&&Instead they hired his 11 year old cousin that they befriended on Fortnite.&&r/unexpectedkratos&&This is the best tag line. &&Interesting twist on the series. &&I thought he was Pearlman for a second there.&&Ron Perlman just looks like Hellboy, so no surprise that Harbour dressed as Hellboy reminds us of Perlman.&&It's because they both look like Hellboy. *Acting.*

&#x200B;

(but yeah I also thought this was Ron Perlman at first)&&I'm convinced that Perlman was brought into this world solely so he could play Hellboy in a live action movie lol&&Oh good, I'm not going crazy.

The Force Awakens and Blade Runner have shown you can use old Harrison Ford well.&&Yeah, not having Perlman sucks, but not having Del Toro makes me really worried about this movie.  Del Toro's Hellboys are some of my favorite comic book movies, and I think the new one just won't be as good without him.&&On Dax Sheperds podcast he said he was wearing a muscle suit but I'm pretty sure he worked out a little too.&&He was definitely working out a lot for this role, but I don’t know if any of the muscle for hellboy is makeup effects or not&&I can guarantee you he did not get that big of a chest or shoulders in this short amount of time. 

Unless he was on a lot of gear and had a great trainer, and even then that's a stretch&&Little of both. He had to lose his dad bod and get into shape enough to take the role, but he’s not in the same shape as hell boy. Definitely some movie magic involved. Can’t fit into a muscle suit if you’re chubby.&&He had a few lines in Season 2 about counting calories and planning on losing weight. The writers knew he got a movie gig so they planted narrative seeds for a reason for him being more fit in Season 3.&&It's a column A/B kinda thing. && It's a suit. I'm sure he pumped himself up for the role but not to that extent. &&Here's a video on his transformation: https://youtu.be/fvs_I2ocbas&&It's definitely a muscle suit: https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/david-harbour-isnt-exactly-getting-shape-hellboy-182631586.html&&He does possess the fist of doom 😏&&I think the F actually stands for 'Fister', it's a title of sorts.&&Sup&&As a Digital Media person, I always see this first.&&It could be Legendary Air Force&&Legendary Anisotropic Filtering&&[deleted]&&And then and then Deadpool pulls out a chimchanga and then he eats it and looks at the camera and says ""haha I'm Deadpool haha I like chimichangas and also being aware of the fact that I am in a movie haha""&&Probably because they give away their ideas online for free.&&Yeah they have a tendency to put dumb things over pictures, remember 'meow' next to Black Panther?&&That's fair. I wasn't really thrilled with the *Legendary* tag myself, but wanted my ""fix"" to be as minor as possible. Just changing the whole tag feels like cheating. &&**on them haters!**&&Horns on fleek&&Hellboy be flossin for that victory royale&&He is getting busy with Sally Hawkins.&&It's a shame but I'm okay with it, gives this movie a chance to set itself apart and introduce other characters, in case it ends up not getting sequels. &&It's fine to shoot out random ideas even if they might be stupid, that's part of the job, there's supposed to be a system in place that scraps ideas if they are stupid af though, THAT system didn't do its job.  

Creative people should be allowed to have some dumb ideas without big consequences, if they weren't then they would be way too restricted and afraid to present their ideas, causing them to play it too safe.

I have no desire to be making a movie with her, or anybody, that she runs and that we don’t. She’s a camp event and a celebrity and that’s all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming.

He put the Hand on Hellboy. It's actually the only remaining piece of an early 'Angel' that was responsible for creating the Ogdru Jahad. It has a long and bloody history and brought ruin to an early civilization of humanity (think Conan the Barbarian).

He's not dead, that's just where he sleeps. &&I read something once from comics writer Brian Michael Bendis, who  talked about being in production meetings for a Spider-Man cartoon, and the whole system seems like a recipe for disaster.  He said that often people throw in suggestions just so it looks like they're contributing.  IIRC, with Spider-Man, someone at one meeting piped up with, ""Does it have to be a spider...?""&&Both those suggestions are ridiculous. I understand that, sometimes, changes to the source material are necessary since some things don’t translate well to film, but what the fuck.&&Hollywood Logic: This is really cool. How can we...make this less unique like it is, and more basic? Oh, it'll still be cool! We're still gonna *call* it Hellboy!&&This explains how The Hobbit trilogy happened. Hollywood got what it wanted, _Because it was *real*_.&&Clop, clop, motherfuckers. &&Me too. However, I'll just copy-paste what I commented on that video as it applies to marvel-studios aswell (and it could be their downfall).  

I think the problem goes deeper than he realizes. It isn't just a monopoly that drives people away from product-development to marketing; it is the very succes of a company that causes this.

As a company grows larger and more succesful, it takes more and more people and shareholders on board. This means that more people are dependent on the continued succes of the company. Literally tens of thousands of people and sometimes even economies of entire countries (think Samsung in South Korea for instance).

Suddenly an immense amount of pressure is put on the ensurance of the continued succes of the company. This means an ever-increasing sense of risk-aversion.

No one wants to be the guy that failed so hard it toppled an empire. This is potentially what product innovation can cause.

However, a company that slowly bleeds to death over many decades due to a failure to innovate or take risks; no one person will carry the blame for this. CEOs will be replaced over and over and over again.

Until, and this is important, the company is in a position that continued failure to innovate will lead blatantly lead to the death of the company.

At this point and ONLY at this point, will the company again be in a position to give people the confidence to take risks and reinvent itself. Because failure would no longer be that great a risk.

This is the cycle I see at big companies and that is the reason I never saw Steve Jobs as the jesus figure that some people did. He came in at this very part of the company's life-cycle. 

Yes; apple needed a visionary to lead the charge in innovating their products. But the entire company was on the verge of death and he did not save Apple despite this but because of it. It granted him the autonomy to risk failure, like any ambitious start-up, but with the financial resources, soft-power and communicative support of a vast multinational corporation.

That's a PERFECT position to facilitate a resurrection. All they needed was someone with the balls (or ego) to risk complete failure.

Now, it is true that during different parts of the life-cycle of a company you have a greater need for either marketing or product development; but one is not necessarily more essential than the other.

The fundamental mistake that companies make, that plays into this cycle, is the extend to which marketing people gut a companies potential capacity to innovate. Once that culture is gone, you cannot call on it when marketing no longer provides a competitive edge (due to the homogenization of products in a given market, like the smartphone market in the past two years or so). 

Though ofcourse, companies are mostly already wise to this cycle. That is the reason they are obsessed with preserving that innovative culture and sniping sillicon valley start-ups with innovative potential in anticipation of this aspect of the market (also to compensate for the homogenisation of hardware and a stagnation of the effect of marketing by innovating in software). But still, you can still blatantly see the risk-aversion of a company like Apple nowadays; their last 2-3 iphones clearly demonstrates they are afraid to make even basic changes that could cause negative backlash which senior decisionmakers would have to take responsibility for. Even something as small as removing the aux-cable functionality is lauded as a brave and extremely risky step.

Quite a rant. Just my two cents though.&&Legendary AF.&&The same person who wastes Tom Hardy in a PG-13 Venom movie.

I would love to see Disney abandoning the current timeline, and just do something original like The Old Republic. There's so much lore, interesting characters and set pieces that you could make 10 fresh Star Wars movies. Disney needs to understand that like MCU people will go to see any Star Wars movie if it's good and brings something fresh. The problem with the last few movies in the Star Wars universe they either seem dumb downed (Last Jedi) or completely unnecessary (Solo movie). At least Rogue One felt like a fresh movie because it could have been set in any timeline.&&Yeah. So far it wasn't worth the loss of the EU and it seems they have no big plan for the future.&&> *""in order to focus their attention on Star Wars: Episode IX and a subsequent trilogy which would conclude the story of Rey.""*

We already knew Rian Johnson's trilogy was dead- a trilogy that was going to focus on completely different characters. But a second trilogy about Rey? When was this announced?

Edit: So apparently Rian Johnson's trilogy was never officially canceled. I assumed it was canceled after Bob Iger announced a ""slowdown"" for Star Wars following the flop of Solo. That being said, it had previously been assumed Rian's trilogy would have totally different characters:

_""In shepherding this new trilogy, which is separate from the episodic Skywalker saga, Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored.""_

So if the new Trilogy is about Rey, this is big news.&&Note: Boba Fett died on the way back to his home planet.&&“... focus their attention on Star Wars: Episode IX and a subsequent trilogy which would conclude the story of Rey.”

A Bobba Fett movie does not work.  He is supposed to be a mysterious focused assassin - the less you know about him, the better.

He and Jango are the only Mandalorians the general public know. &&Much more possibilities in the show, agreed.&&I don’t want backstory, I just want to know if he lived or not in the new canon.&&I really wish Republic Commando hadn't been declared non-canon because the culture it sets up for Mandalore would be soooooo dope in a tv show&&Upvoted but wouldn’t downplay as “compromise;” Disney is all about OTT TV, especially in international markets.  They also realize that spinoffs have a much smaller audience.  They can make a better quality streamable series for less money, so it makes a profit AND engages die hard fans to influence the major release of Episode IX

IMO global audiences only show up for the biggest movies each year... can’t get that with spinoffs; too much competition from flagship marvel releases, Oscar-winning blockbusters, animated, etc.  Smart to avoid the margin cuts at the box-office unless it’s a guaranteed hit.&&Greedo!&&They kind of already wrapped that relationship up in Rebels, and as I recall, in a way that indicated the two hadn’t interacted since oh, half a lifetime ago.&&I was going to say it's been out long enough that everyone has seen the movie, but then I remembered no one actually saw it.

That said, I really really want a trilogy with Obi Wan and that character. Each get a standalone movie where they each get their own proper arc and development and then the third is where they finally meet face to face. &&[deleted]&&I highly doubt it. They already covered that situation in Rebels, and it was stated that they hadn't interacted since TCW. And the enemy part had no idea of Obi's location till then.

&&Kenobi killed Maul tho. They met for the first time since TCW in Rebels, they won't be meeting in any potential Kenobi movie. &&Ah you mean Max Rebo? Dude, that part where he saved Han by using the corpse of General Greivous as a Marionette to distract the guards was fucking *sick!*&&Jar Jar is the key to all of this&&If prefer this to a Boba Fett movie, 100% honest. Like what the hell would the movie be about, lol. I'd watch it.&&I want a Noir movie starring Jar Jar.&&The Star Wars team at Disney is awful at reading the public pulse. Early responses to a Han Solo movie were tepid at best; I think they failed to see (and still fail to recognize) that it was the actor as much as the character that we wanted to see. Meanwhile, an entire generation of Star Wars fans is frothing at the mouth for an Obi-Wan film with the guy who played Obi-Wan in episodes 1-3, and they’re like, “Meh, there’s no interest.”

If they wanted to do a brand new movies with brand new characters, people would be fine with that; Rogue One was, for the most part, well received. But don’t try to force one of the most iconic characters back on to us just because you killed off his incredibly charismatic actor in another film. 

It’s so obvious, I can’t comprehend why they do things the way they do. &&What do you mean ""opened up""? Rogue One was the first anthology movie.&&They already rematched in Star Wars Rebels&&Solo set up a bunch of interesting threads. It wasnt the greatest movie, no. But I was really interested in what was going to happen to Crimson Dawn and what they hinted at with Jabba. I wonder if they'll just abandon that now?&&I thought they completely retconned the expanded universe to excuse them having to address them in the movies?&&There's been very little (almost nothing at all) from the new canon that involves the Old Republic era, so I'm guessing Lucasfilm is keeping that in their back pocket to really expand on when they deem the time is right.&&Stories from the Old Republic era was a huge part of what made me a Star Wars fan in the first place. I fell in love with that era through the two Knights of the Old Republic games and things like the Darth Bane books and Old Republic comics from the late 00s deepened that love. I found the EU content focused around the Clone Wars to be really interesting and fun, as well (much better than the movies I thought and also helped me enjoy them more).

When it felt like it was basically wiped away in favor of more Luke Skywalker & Friends, I lost a **lot** of interest and nothing I've seen since has really brought it back. I simply do not care enough about the original trilogy characters and stories (outside of stories that help us better understand Vader) to get lost in the modern Star Wars that seems to be almost entirely focused on just that.&&GIVE ME A REVAN MOVIE FFS.

You want every meatbag SW fan to collectively cream their pants to an announcement? Simple: REVAN&&A Revan movie would be dope.&&That's because immediately as the big bad evil empire is defeated oooooh spoooooooky maaaaagic happens and there's instantaneously ANOTHER big bad evil empire before the good guys who defeated the first big bad evil empire are even dead!  OOOOHHHH!&&The first movie started out a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. This immediately took the audience away from the familiar and into a world of infinite possibility. With every installment, they have further restricted themselves by insisting on keeping the focus around the Skywalker saga. There are other times, other events, but everything in the movies just has to be anchored around the Skywalkers. It weighs the whole world down.&&Rogue One did it well, new people, new planets, new story, with just enough of the originals to keep the same star wars taste&&There was that moment in the latest one where Maz Kanata was sneaking around getting into blaster fights and still managed to answer her phone.   
...could we just follow her instead? Her thing seems really cool, instead of finding every silly way to make someone else's situation more tense.&&Rogue One was the right step. Make a self contained movie set in the universe but not part of the saga (apart from the ending).&&Do you really think that ? I really liked RO but IMHO there was no way to expand on that movie's style/setting/characters. It works well because it's self-contained - and it's a rare thing in this genre of movies these days.

Besides, I can really feel the SW fatigue right now. Maybe it's just me, but I'm tired of the Original Trilogy settings. I actually liked Solo and SW8 (kinda), but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be as impressed by RO if it were released right now. They need to move on, to shake things up. I'm 100 % in the ""they need to change the time period and go wild"" side right now.&&RO was the movie that made people hopeful about the future of Star Wars movies... then Last Jedi came out and the rest is history.&&It was so great! I wish they’d resurrect it!&&Don't forget light sabres. That's probably 90% why I like Star Wars. The remaining 10% is a certain bikini.&&Don’t forget he tells Vader, “I need him alive. He’s no good to me dead.” Motherfucker actually talked back to Vader, and he was cool with it.

He went out like a chump, but he was a badass in Empire.&&That combo'd with lack of information on him is what made him so cool. Sometimes the mystery of a character makes them so interesting. One of the reasons I was glad they did Snoke the way they did. We have so little info other than he was strong in the force and good at getting a army together.&&And then he goes out like a bitch. He got beaten by a blind guy *by accident*.&&I don't believe it, I'm checking snokes.com&&Wasn’t the original idea to have more movies after Empire Strikes Back where one or two would be Luke searching for and rescuing Han (and Boba Fett would have more of a story)?

> “Originally Boba Fett was set up in Empire as a character, and the third movie’s plot was going to be more about Boba Fett rescuing Han Solo and all of that,” Miller revealed. “Boba was gonna be the main villain… That was set up, why he was taking Han Solo away, why there was a thing with him in the Christmas special.

>“When George decided not to make a third trilogy, he completely jettisoned that story line, which is why in the first ten minutes, Boba Fett gets bumped into and falls into the mouth of a giant monster,” Miller added. “So he took what was planned for the third trilogy, which was the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader, and the battle with the Emperor, and that got squished down from three movies to one movie. And that became the plot of Jedi.”&&Most people have never even heard of the shows much less watched them though. Especially since they are focused towards kids. 

I think it's crazy enough they brought him back in Solo.

The gang of bounty hunters (and their subsequent allegiance with Maul) were some of the most interesting plotlines, as it allowed for some cool universe expanding as bounty hunters never really needed a reason to be at different places. 

Seeing Boba, as bratty as he was, rise through the ranks of the hunters slowly over the course of the show was intriguing in its own- there was genuine terror as a small child took out an entire Venator in a rage of vengeance.

&&They want more films out of their Disney Princess. &&Rey steals a lightspeed time traveling technology from the First Order and goes back in time to effortlessly defeat Darth Vader, The Emperor, Darth Maul and kicks Yoda's ass for good measure.&&Yeah, I guess we don't really need to worry about Rey's outcome in the next movie.

They killed off Luke and gave her all his force prowess and natural talent for no reason.

And we know for fact they have to kill of Leia in the next movie, I mean, she's the only leadership person left in the entirety of the 'rebels' so just pretending like she's around the corner but never on camera is dumb.

So they're going to kill Leia off and make Rey the resistance 'general' for no reason whatsoever either.

Do you honestly think they'd kill her off when they're actively killing off all the old characters so she can absorb their character traits through osmosis or some shit?&& We can only hope. She is a really boring character who's main personality is 'I don't know my parents'. &&Didn't Disney recently say they were re-thinking everything?

""What is yousa be bidding my masta?""&&> Meanwhile, an entire generation of Star Wars fans is frothing at the mouth for an Obi-Wan film with the guy who played Obi-Wan in episodes 1-3

Man, I have a strong dislike for the prequels, and I'm *still* frothing at the mouth for an Obi-Wan film. Ewan McGregor was hands down the best thing about that entire trilogy.&&I think one big problem with Solo is that he's not an interesting character in itself: he's just a smuggler with a roguish and charming personality, it's a very generic stereotype.  He was good in the movies because of the actor and script 

he's a regular criminal, he got there like all other generic smugglers in the universe, his motivation is money.  People were excited for the prequels because there were big question: what was Darth Vader story? How did he become evil? Who's the emperor?

The biggest question with Solo was ""what's the Kessel Run?"", and it's not enough to carry a movie if it can be explained in half a paragraph&&Even if they de aged Harrison Ford and made a Solo prequel with him I still wouldn't give a shit. It was a story that didn't need to be told. Especially when it's just a nostalgia trip to explain everything mentioned in his past.

A Boba Fett movie would suck for the same reasons people hated seeing him as a kid in the prequels. He was only interesting in the first place because he was mysterious and dangerous.&&Just my opinion, but Disney (at least the higher ups) dont seem to care much about what more hardcore star wars fans want. They seem to be much more interested in attracting as much of the general public as possible. 

SW fans may want an Obi Wan movie, but the general public hasn't thought about Obi Wan since 2005. &&It's not just about American audiences, it's about the international audiences. The non English speaking countries haven't shown out for Star Wars since The Force Awakens.

They don't care about prequel and things that are made to help build up the Saga films.

An Obi-Wan movie would bomb in China and Japan. Even if Americans and the British loved it.

I think if the Loki and Scarlett Witch series do well on the Disney Streaming service, we are more likely to see an Obi-Wan mini-series on the streaming service than a theatrically released Obi-Wan movie.&&the last Jedi and solo convinced me to wait until the movies come out on HBO or something similar.  not paying to see anything else they have to offer &&The issue with an Obi-Wan film is what story do you plan to tell?

The story where Obi-Wan hangs out in a desert for 15 years meditating?

The story Rebels already told where he finishes Maul's arc, that wasn't even really his story because he grew past that?

You can tell the story pre Ep1. Maybe. But now with McGreggor.

So... What story about Obi-Wan starring that actor... Do you want?&&[deleted]&&> it was the actor as much as the character that we wanted to see. 

Also there's so little point to seeing solo before ANH.

The whole point of his arc is him going from swashbuckling smuggler who only cares about himself to being part of a larger good and doing things for his friends.

There's only so much character you can add prior to that when that's already there. &&True, forgot that. I guess it's they should have prioritized an Obi-Wan movie over Solo.&&Yes but it'll be better within a live action film. There's a lot of people who didn't watch rebels but actively watch the films.&&I share the same opinion. I didn't think Solo was great but it did set up some interesting prospects for future films. &&You are right.  They are now calling it [Star Wars Legends](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends).  

""Expanded Universe will be printed under the Star Wars Legends banner, and a new continuity has been established that consists only of the original six films, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and film, and all future material from that point onward.""

It would be a little weird to say none of this happened then bring back certain parts.  &&Wasn't Revan at some point made canon?

Some bits of the EU was made canon like Thrawn. I haven't been keeping track though of what is and isn't, I heard rumors that Revan and Bane at some point were alluded to, making them cannon.&&They kinda soft ret-conned it to be honest. Basically as other have said made it all ""legends"" but still take some of it and make cannon. It seems that they did this so that they can do what they like entirely, or sort of adapt EU material, or just take bit, or use it entirely. The way they treat it is basically that it is literal legend in the Cannon, the kind of legend where maybe it did happen just not exactly like that. Does that make sense?&&from the POV of the general public, **Star Wars is the Skywalker story.** That's why TLJ continued to obsess about it. They can't break free and do original stuff because to the general public, the 8 movies are the canon with a dash of Rogue One.

All these concepts in the spinoff material like the Old Republic, or how Darth Maul is this tragic character in the cartoons, has made like no impact on public consciousness. A few comments higher I saw a suggestion for an Obi-Wan vs Maul movie. The general public would react to that as ""Wait, why is he fighting the guy from The Phantom Menace 19 years ago?"" and even ""Didn't he die?"" (because no one saw or gave a shit about *Solo*)&&I haven't seen any of the new star wars movies in theaters, I would absolutely with out a doubt 100% go watch the fuck out of an Old Republic movie &&For me the original trilogy has been done to death for decades.  A fresh era where you can't just bring up fan favorite or familiar characters.  A Darth Bane story from his perspective would be amazing.  &&The Sequels are essentially Original Trilogy 2: Electric Boogaloo. Same thing, but way worse in every way except post-production processing.

The thing about the Old Republic era is that BioWare and the people who designed the era before them (if there were any, can't remember) is that they really thought out and stuck true to what had been established about the Star Wars Universe and how they could incorporate new lore without seeming conceited. The Sequels felt a lot like the people at the writer's bench sat down and said to each other ""hey, that sounds cool, let's do it!"" Without questioning *if* they should do it.&&Revan is a nerd rage trap, they won't touch it with a 10 foot pole&&Basically skipping over how the Empire fell and came back to full prominence was one of the biggest mistakes.  I don't care if it's explained in a novel or cartoon or whatever either; not when the movies are mediocre to bad.&&when the new trilogy was announced, i assumed it was going to be some twist on how the rebellion got ""big"" and basically became the zealots, became the new version of the empire. so good turned into bad because of corruption or whatever. enter a new rebellion and viola -- you're making a soft reboot, which they did.

&#x200B;

but no, TFA happens and there's this big empire-but-not-empire and the rebellion was powerless. Lol like 30 fucking years or something after Jedi. it was jarring and hard to wrap my head around and it bothered me for the whole movie.

also, Knights of Ren? who the fuck are they? are they important? where are they? how did literally ANY of this happen?? how was it allowed to happen??

then we had another strange tone/atmosphere/plot/fucking everything shift into TLJ. i swear like half an hour into TLJ i was honestly wondering if i was supposed to read some book or comic or watch some tv show before going into the theater. because those movies were so mismatched, holy fuck.

what a goddamn mess, all of it. would be ok if they just scrapped the third movie and started over. i don't care where these characters go or what they do, they could all die in the first 5 minutes or live forever it doesn't matter to me. what a waste.

&#x200B;

whew sorry, /rant over&&Stop. You're scaring me&&To its credit, Rogue One didn't excessively fawn over established characters. Rogue One did its own thing. Its characters were one-offs. They're not coming back for any sequels. This gave Rogue One both a lot of creative freedom while also being an extremely immediate prequel to A New Hope, with A New Hope starting mere minutes after Rogue One ends.

Its sort of a bottle episode. Its self contained, doesn't rely on in-jokes and references to past events, and because the characters aren't coming back for sequels its free to expand the setting. It can try new things without many strings attached.

The other new Star Wars movies really need to let the past die. Despite this being the entire theme and arc words of TLJ, the movie failed to take this message to heart. The main movies need to let go of the Skywalkers. This includes copying the Skywalkers. Not-Anakin and Not-Luke fighting the Not-Deathstar needs to all go away.

Let Rey be her own thing. Copying Luke's character arc very nearly word for word has stunted her character growth. We also have a replacement Darth Vader and we had a replacement Deathstar because why not? Third time's the charm, I guess?

This includes letting Carrie Fisher go. Its gone past morbid into the realm of comedy. Its like Weekend at Bernie's at this point, keeping a dead woman around to make new movies. Stop flogging her corpse. For the love of god just let the poor woman rest.&&I’m not saying to turn Rogue One into a trilogy or anything. I’m more just saying that it could have been a way for them to say that they are taking a new direction and telling stories that never got told. I don’t completely agree they need to change the time setting now and “go wild”. But I’m not against the idea either. There’s tons of stuff they could use in the books that a lot of people don’t know. And I wish they would just go ahead and use it. &&I felt the same but about The Force Awakens.&&Agreed:

&&Yeah it's too bad they didn't have an epic Han vs Boba showdown subplot in Jedi. I mean, it was more like Scarecrows cameo in Dark Knight. They could've had the whole movie be building toward a fight to the death in jetpacks between the two. Instead, Boba gets comically knocked over and dies and Han hangs with Ewoks while Lando destroys the Death Star in his ship.&&One of the biggest things I liked about the prequels was that they added another level to the Vader-Fett dynamic.

The highlight of Vader's life was being the General for a bunch of Fett clones. The 501st was, on average, very old men by Empire. Vader must have enjoyed working alongside a young, prime clone once again.&&Vader doesnt even alter his deal, paid in full even if Han did die. Bobas legend is in that one scene&&I see this point a lot and I think it is overstated. Leah and Tarkin both talk to Vader like he's a bitch. &&Snoke didn't work tho because he was the central villain of the first two films of the new trilogy. We needed to know his motivations and yet I still have no idea who he even is.&&100% agree. When we finally learned more about him in the prequels, he lost a certain degree of “coolness”. 

The original actor, Jeremy Bulloch even said that a character like Boba Fett was cooler if you knew less about them. &&Dude, everyone knows that's a rebel propaganda site. If you want the real truth you gotta go to empirewars.com&&I really respect that they did that and it's a great way to get people interested  in them

LOVE that they used the animation voice and live action actor&&I had no idea he survived being cut in half until he showed up in Solo. I had to google whether it was the same character or a different person from the same alien race. Seems pretty dumb to me that he survived.&&Much better, thank you&&Thank God&&Pervy neighborhood watch set in the Star Wars universe&&No no bounty hunt for Jaba to finance his vette&& wish I never saw that photo.&&I want a dedicated Bounty Hunter movie. Mostly the bounty hunters that Vader lined up. Maybe three or four rather separate concurrent stories, all being tied together by some encounter with Fett.

TLJ sold 1/3 of TFA and this years sales are down 35% from that.

It's dead jim. They killed it.&&Including a live show.&&[lmao look at this dweeb](https://i.redd.it/g9s8834tw0r11.png)&&can live with this&&My heart fell when I heard that, too. She's not compelling as a heroine - too immediately good at everything. She's going to rampage through the New Order in the next movie and then...what? I don't need to see her obliterate all obstacles in her path like Bruce Willis in Die Hard for another three movies.

They'd be well advised to listen to the fans on this thread and just back slowly away from the unholy mess that is the current Star Wars era for about a decade, do some Old Republic stuff, and then just effing reboot Star Wars completely. A New New Hope.&&We just know it will *conclude* the story of Rey. Much like you could say the current trilogy concluded the story of Han for instance. That doesn’t necessarily mean she will be the main character &&Yeah Kylo is my favorite of the new characters and I wouldn’t watch a trilogy based on him either &&I'm already sitting out IX...&&There’s only one princess in the Star Wars universe dammit&&I’m more worried they aren’t gonna complete her story as much as tease the new trilogy &&Shiny and chrome&&They did but they pretty much explicitly stated in that same press release that the Benioff/Weiss and Rian Johnson projects are still in production.

Making good movies is incidental to Disney's business plan of raking in merch and theme park revenue.

It's not that they're trying to bring in the general population at the expense of hardcore fans, they just know who's going to shell out regardless. &&I second this.  I always saw new Stars Movies the week they came out.  The last two have shifted me to “I might stream it when it is released to video”.   Quite the change....&&It's one of the best. Star Wars fans are weird man. Fanatics that don't want any new content. If you like Star Wars, Solo delivered. Space chases, wookie, weird canteenas, droids. Ticked most of the boxes. &&Most people liked it. It's just that nobody really wanted it. Pair that with TLJ backlash and it's no wonder it didn't do well. &&Me too.  But I did go into it not expecting too much (largely because of the mixed reviews) so I guess it's not surprising that it didn't do as well as they would have hoped.  But it really exceeded my expectations.&&Oh I agree. Even this Fett movie would have been better.&&Option 1, show the collision as they did in rebels with Ezra present, some kid who doesn’t make sense without context of the tv show.  
Option 2, ignore Ezra, retconning rebels.

Neither option works&&Except, unlike the original view of canon; disney now says that all media is the same level of canon... & rebels is canon.. 

Ill give them a year or two & they revert to the old multi-level style of canon to let them retcon things they dont like. 
&&> It would be a little weird to say none of this happened then bring back certain parts.

They already have as far as I've heard.&&Except that they've shown with Rebels that they are willing to take character designs and other elements from Legends and adapt them as they see fit.

I think the idea was the Legends canon is the ""myth and stories"" that the ""real"" canon speaks of in whispers in dark alleys and taverns throughout the universe. So some parts of it could be true (ie re-introduced later) while other parts can be ignored/disproven. Gives them the freedom to pick what they like and ignore the rest.&&> It would be a little weird to say none of this happened then bring back certain parts. 

They already did. Thrawn in Rebels. Darth Bane being confirmed canon in Clone Wars, etc. &&Some old Republic ships have been made canon. The hammerhead corvette as seen in Rogue one, some old republic cruiser showed up in either TCW or rebels (I can't remember which one). They also mention the Mandalorian Wars against the old Republic in the clone wars.&&I don’t think it’s that they don’t want to use any of the EU, they just don’t want to be beholden to it. By calling them legends, any amount of any story could be true, so they’re really just trying to have their cake and eat it too. Which isn’t too bad for us - I don’t really mind if they change stuff in the translation from book to film because that’s usually how great movies are translated out of books.&&I love Revan, and I’m constantly looking for a way for him to be canon. He was ALMOST canon in the Clone Wars show. He had a model and everything. The only thing closer than that is Kylo’s getup. But that’s just “it looks similar” and not much else. 

Some aspects from KOTOR have been made canon by promotional material. Or almost canon, if that doesn’t count. (Certain mention of some saber crystals, and planets on the star map) But I wouldn’t consider that super canon. 

The MMO, from my understanding, is in a grey area, or was at one point. I think it’s probably non-canon, but I haven’t heard any confirmation. It’s like, some people who work with the new canon are acutely aware of certain EU things, and the Old Republic universe has had some call outs, but nothing definitive as of now. 

My big fear is that they’ve been using KOTOR “assets” for the sequels. Aesthetic designs for Rey and Kylo for instance. So I feel like our hopes of canonized old republic are probably going to be disappointed. But it’s been so close, a few times. &&Bane is canon. Revan is not, at least not yet.

Which is a little strange because Bane based his teachings off of Revan's.&&Bane is canon, but he looks totally different from his Legends version. Bane is still the origin of the Rule of Two in canon as well. Yoda goes to Moraband (formerly known as Korriban) to visit his grave in the Clone Wars cartoon. Also, Bane is voiced by Mark Hamill. &&[Long story short, no they weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeluyPSnDQc)&&Maybe solo wasn’t as successful but it doesn’t seem accurate to say that a blockbuster movie, even a lower tier one, wasn’t seen by anyone. 

Also, in the words of Luke Skywalker “I care!” &&I totally hear you, and agree with what you said. I have friends that are casual friends that were very confused by certain events near the end of Solo.

That being said soon they’ll have to choice to pivot from the Skywalker story. We will see.&&If you really think about it the Skywalker family is the worst thing to happen to the galaxy. Anakin falls and becomes Vader and is a large part of forming the Empire. Luke saves him in the end, but then the sequels make nothing he and his friends do matter because the galaxy is back to being Empire vs Rebels again since he enabled Ben to fall.&&*Star Wars* is a nerd rage trap&&#notmyrevanreeeeeeee&&Just like Boba Fett.  Revan would be really cool to see though, I think that has more potential than a Fett movie.&&[deleted]&&>how did literally ANY of this happen?? how was it allowed to happen??

""Wait a minute, how did this happen, we're smarter than this!""&&Thank you for this haha.
Yeah as someone who thought Rogue One was somewhat bad but still better than this new sequel trilogy...I don’t know what they are doing anymore...&&Yeah, seriously, the rebellion clearly failed at governance and Luke failed at rebuilding the Jedi order and now some warlord is resurgent, the resistance is weaker than the rebellion and the first order even built a bigger super weapon than a Death Star. Why are we giving these people a second chance after they clearly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.&&> also, Knights of Ren? who the fuck are they? are they important? where are they? how did literally ANY of this happen?? how was it allowed to happen??
> 

They let someone completely derail the second movie in a trilogy.  I don't even know what it is that I'm supposed to be excited for in E9.&&So maybe you don't have five hours to spend on Youtube videos, but you've said how I felt, and I feel like you would appreciate someone [digging into just how bad the sequels are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw7pcCj0ORk). He also does one on TFA, which is shorter, but the guy is on point, and he basically goes scene by scene showing how terrible the new films are.

And it's not ""I'm a Star Wars fan and I have these issues with universe inconsistencies"" ranting. It's honest to goodness, these people were terrible film makers and somehow someone was stupid enough to give them creative control. &&>The other new Star Wars movies really need to let the past die.  Despite this being the entire theme and arc words of TLJ. 

That absolutely not the theme of the movie. The message of the movie came from Yoda and Luke at the end,  not from the villain. &&Republic commando movie in the style of Sicario.&&I loved TFA. I know everyone complained that it was just the same as New Hope, but it was just such a fun movie. Nothing felt out of place, it was good fun, felt like Star Wars was *back*, and got the ball rolling for future movies.

And then in the first 90 seconds of TLJ we get Luke tossing the saber like he's on a skit or something. I was just devastated. &&I was gonna make the exact same joke and was googleing for a picture then I realized *she doesn't wear a top. She is topless.*&&For the love of all that is holy, NSFL tag please. &&Can we delete this hunk of shit scene from the collective Human conciousness?&&NSFW! *jeez* ^^thanks&&Of course he gets the job done. Motherfucker leads the Empire right to the falcon. That's why it's annoying to hear Boba doesn't do anything. Act 3 is all Bobas doing &&It's not like Anakin was a stickler for rules either&&>Bobs Fett

Next thing you're gonna tell me Jango is just a nickname and his full name is actually Vegene Fett...&&But boba fett did not die ..the armour protected him.  .this would have been a great point to start the boba fett movie with.  &&Holy SHIT.  

I never, for one second, considered this before you just said it. &&Ok, now *this* is the buddy movie I want to see.&&Leia's about to get tortured so she's just lashing out Vader doesnt care. Its implied Tarkin is one of the only Imperial officers who's good enough to actually act like he owns the place and not get his ass handed over to him. In the expanded universe he's basically the most ruthless and competent officer and has the Emperor's trust and more or less Vader's respect but they do plot against each other a lot. &&Tarkin outranked Vader though, and Leah was under his 'protection' at that time as well. Boba wasn't even affiliated with the empire.&&It’s not even that. He doesn’t work because he’s the Sith with a huge army in a sequel to the movie where the Sith and the Empire where defeated. Like how is there a Sith and an Empire again? You need a little bit of an explanation there. It just feels like a huge ass pull. Even if there was one line saying that no one knows where he came from would have been better than nothing. Like he had to have been alive during the OG trilogy.  Did Palpatine know about him? Wouldn’t he sense another Sith that powerful in the force?  Or  where does he get all his resources to make giant ass ships and a mega death planet? Does he control a part of the galaxy?  Does he have the Star Forge? Most of these could have been addressed in the opening scroll ffs. 

It would be like if Dooku was the big bad in the Prequel trilogy and they defeated him and his army and then skipped right to a new hope. &&I dont think we ever will. They screwed the pooch on that trying to do another version of the Emperor killed by his own student.

But gave him no backstory nor did anyone seem to fear snoke&&Sam Witwer.

[Goddamn.](https://www.darkhorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sam-witwer-joins-the-cast-of-supergirl-696x464.jpg) &&I was delighted in the theater when I heard Sam Witwer's voice. He's been such a big part of the SW universe for years now and I really wanted him to have even a minor role in the movies in recognition of that. Wasn't expecting it in Solo but it made me SO happy.&&I agree.&&You expected a dashing rouge or a grizzled battle worn man.

Too bad it's just Bob from accounting who got fed up with his job and bought some old armor off of space Ebay and decided to make a career change because he hated working for the intergalactic space bank that his brother Jeffrey talked him into after their mother got space cancer and Jeffrey thought a stable job would help Bob settle down and have a space family with his space wife, but Bob just couldn't get into the swing of working such a mundane space job so he thought being a bounty hunter would snap him out of his space mid life crisis. 
&&But, maybe without the family friendly part. &&You can't revive that, once it dies it dies. Disney will squeeze money out of it for decades while we all move on  &&♪♫ You'll never make an ewok out of meeee! ♫♪&&I mean, it'll sell tickets&&Before Ep. 7 I already figured I'll call it quits after 9.

Though Jango said he was from Concord Dawn and the government of Mandalore denied he was Mandalorian. &&What it fundamentally comes down to is that, allegedly, George had the idea that Boba Fett just wore the armor OF the Mandalorians, not that he WAS one of them. The equivalent would be if Dog the Bounty Hunter wore feudal samurai armor and everyone just assumed he was Japanese.

The Boba Fett fan club tries to document every instance where the whole ""is he Mandalorian or does he just WEAR their armor"" and have determined it's just the latter. Note: Pablo Hildago is the current arbiter of canonicity and he has said repeatedly that Boba is not a Mandalorian (and that George didn't think he was either).

I mean... Goongas.&&He knocked it out of the park. He *IS* Palpatine.&&Ian McDiarmid was even better as prequel Palpatine than he was as the Emperor, he was a total standout.

Ewan McG's acting by comparison was really not impressive.

Just look at this scene of Ewan acting opposite the late Christopher Lee's Count Dooku

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXHDpCe-KI&t=10

McGregor's performance is totally flat even before you compare it to Christopher Lee's excellent acting that brings shading and nuance to everything he says.

I think people just remember Ewan's prequel Obi-Wan with rose colored glasses because he was the best part of Episode I and then in II and III he gets sent off on side quests to distant planets which spares him from being involved in the trainwreck scenes like the romance on Naboo and the politics on Coruscant. The character becomes one of the least bad things about the prequels so people clamor for the actor to come back. &&20 years to go.&&Hasn't it been like 10 years since the prequels? More? They could easily do a 10 year time skip with Obi in the desert and it isn't like it wouldn't make any sense.&&This is why I was/am completely befuddled as to why they chose to do a movie about the character who is (in my mind) least replaceable by another actor. Any Star Wars movie is going to make a mint, so why fuck with Han Solo?&&Well, isn't the original line praising the ship anyway? He says that the Falcon is the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, not that he's the reason it succeeded. He seems to take pride in boasting right after landing, but that's probably due to the stunts he  pulled while in the nebula (skimming on asteroids and such) that allowed the crew to survive the shorter path. &&Same, I had to come to reddit to get an answer as to what those even were.&&It was hardcore fans. They would buy multiple tickets and high dollar toys and merch all day every day. Regardless of what got churned out, *until* TLJ and Solo.

Solo showed that, no, they can't just draw in casuals and families based on the SW IP pedigree alone. Solo is the first sw bomb and merchandise is DOWN since TLJ.

Disney is completely mishandling the franchise. They wrongly assumed they'd get huge returns in merch and ticket sales from new and general audiences while also alienating the ""whale"" hardcore fans that spent more on branded stuff than a family of 5 did.&&I think this gets to the truth of it. Obi-wan doesn't sell merch and theme park attractions. Even Boba Fett is marginal in that regard.&&I was kinda halfway there with TFA already. Mostly the good things about that movie were Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley and John Williams. The plot of that movie was goddamn *dumb*. Every single plot device in that movie is just in service of monetizing all the Star-Wars-Stuff-That-Has-A-TM-Sign-Next-To-It. Ironically the only really original idea in the movie is the Rathtars, the scene people probably *skip the most* when they rewatch it.

TLJ continued to have good acting and good music, paired this time with really good direction and cinematography, but it's all in service of such a trainwreck of a story that it's impossible to be excited about anymore.

Initially I thought TLJ was pretty okay but when Infinity War came out a few months later I was like ""oh. THIS is what it feels like to be excited about what happens next.""&&I liked the Star Wars Stories better than the new trilogy honestly&&There are several things from Legends that have made their way back in. Admiral Thrawn and the TIE Defender are two big things from legends that are now canon.&&They're ""legends"" so the stories might/aren't/can be cannon meaning everything is able to be used and rewritten(or not) at will.&&I actually like this idea a lot. Brings some pleasure back to reading old EU stuff despite knowing it’s not canon. Not that I’m much into Star Wars EU any more, but I liked the Darth Bane books a lot and think anybody interested in reading them shouldn’t be turned off by the fact that the only part of it that’s currently canon is that Bane existed.&&They named a little boy Jacen.&&When watching rogue one K-2SO made me think off HK-47. &&Now that I think about it you're right.. Kylo Ren looks almost exactly the same as Revan in KotOR. That actually makes me kinda sad because I loved KotOR as a kid and wish they'd make another modern version :(&&Rebels even has them on Malachor, and implies a whole lot. But nothing concrete.&&Yeah: rule of 2 from Revan's holocron.&&If you thought the ""muh admiral ackbar"" TLJ outrage was overblown, just wait baby we're only getting started&&One of the guys in Lucasfilm said that if he had his way Revan would be a woman.  So many nerds will be pissed.  &&'the resistance' 

I mean really? Ugh..&&I'm not sure how they salvage it to be honest:

- Rey can't be stopped. There's no tension in her challenges, because she overcomes all of them just by trying. 
- Kylo can't have a conflicted relationship with the force like Vader did, because Kylo is a cold-blooded mother fucker in TLJ. Once Vader found out Luke was his son, he killed more imperial soldiers than he did Rebels or good guys. Kylo has no such plot twist, and he's killed his master, tried to kill his former master, his dad, and if not for magic non-Jedi space flight he'd have killed his mother as well. 
- All of the OT characters are gone except Chewy, R2, and C3PO. I don't believe any of them can be killed off in a meaningful way that makes the film better. I'm sure that won't stop Abrams from trying though. Technically Leia is still there, but that's pre-recorded so who knows what that means.
- Hyperdrive is a weapon of mass destruction. Established in TLJ. I don't know how they write any meaningful fleet battles or planet evacuations or anything, when the universe has a known weapon that can mangle giant fleets by traveling at light speed. 
- Luke is dead, so Rey and Kylo are the last of the force users as we know them. Luke can come back blue ghost style, but otherwise there's no next level to this. It's just Rey and Kylo having a showdown, and based on what we've seen Rey pretty much has to kill Kylo - there is no way to believably plot twist that away.
- I'm not sure what purpose Poe plays in this universe. Obviously he's the fly boy, but he's not the love interest and he's not conflicted by anything. He's Wedge Antilles, except he's getting a ton of screen time. My best guess is that he leads the Resistance as a counterpart to Hux (another useless character wasted), but that is basically an entirely new direction for the character and entirely wasteful. 
- There's no more Jedi. If Rey continues towards a Jedi Temple rebuilding, she has to do it from scratch. 
- The closest thing to a romance in these films was Rey and Finn, which is why Rose came out of nowhere and put that to bed. Finn's only use as a character was to give an emotional connection to Rey (who no longer needs one as she has found her way), and now he's emotionally connected to someone else. They will try and write him as a guy moved by Rose, who decides to finally fight for what he loves. It's gonna be flat. 
- If the Empire didn't end 30 years ago, they will have to figure out a way to write away the New Order more permanently. I'm not sure how you do that. 

The worst thing about all of this: everything points to the need for Lucasfilm to expand beyond a trilogy, create new villains, expand the universe, and take time working the garbage fire we have now into a meaningful ending. Maybe we get two trilogies, and X ends with Kylo building the Knights of Ren into some kind of Sith school, while Rey balances that by rebuilding the temple. Even if they do that though, the fatigue that hits after X is going to be a serious blow to the franchise. 

I think X does well in theaters, but is absolutely the most hated Star Wars film. Expect people to long for the days of Phantom Menace.&&You know it's bad when the Red Letter Media guys are the exact target market for Star Wars nerdgasms and they said they're basically done with the franchise. It's like 7 shitty movies in a row.&&""Holy fuck I didn't know I needed this until now"" is such a Reddit cliche

Christopher Lee was many years his senior and it probably came very naturally to him with little input from Lucas.

Ewan received a ton of acclaim for his roles in Trainspotting and Moulin Rouge, which were both released before Eps 2 and 3.  &&>Just look at this scene of Ewan acting opposite the late Christopher Lee's Count Dooku

On one hand I agree with you, Lee's acting outshines Ewan's in practically every way. On the other hand, which gigantic moron is responsible for putting him in a spinning light beam that constantly turns him away from the person he's having a conversation with? Yes, the acting difference is glaring, but good fucking god is the cinematography just so many levels worse.&&People still say how amazing Samuel L Jackson was in those movies.

&&Not the best example since it's kinda tough to be expressive when you can't move, haha.&&Is McGregor's technical acting ability the only reason people like the character? I thought the direction Lucas took is great, he could of just been a younger version of the orignal, a wise stoic man, but he's charismatic, hilarious, and plenty flawed, which in a rare instance of good charactersation in the prequels.&&It'll take him like 40-50 years before he *looks* as old as old Ben, let's be honest.&&Besides Han is interesting because of who he is in ANH and how he grows through the series. Not how he became the character we met in ANH. &&> Any Star Wars movie is going to make a mint, so why fuck with Han Solo?

Apparently not.
&&They were planning on pulling a Wrigleys and getting a doublemint. Gotta get as much as you can after all&&It's beffudleception when you consider we have talks of an Obi-wan movie floating around and tons of interest, with an actor people love in the role expressing interest, and nothing is happening. But then again, if they couldn't realize how much of the appeal of Han Solo was the actor, why would they suddenly realize it now? It's a shame.&&Yeah, Luke calls it a piece of junk, and Han says something like “Hey, this is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.”&&The two biggest problems with TLJ are the insistence on shoveling in incredibly stupid stuff in order to set up a pre-planned story, (a gravity based slow bombing run in space?) and the fact that there aren't any characters, just people you don't give a shit about saying things you don't give a shit about. 

Ok, so one problem, really. The writing. Everything written for TLJ was bad and stupid. &&The OG Thrawn was amazing, so glad they brought him back. Says a lot about a character that is just so good that when you recon him out of existence, you shrug and realize the whole thing was better with him there. &&There's a lot of good books/stuff in Legends, as much as some of it deserves to be de-canon-ized(?). (Looking at you Splinter of the Minds Eye) 

The Bounty Hunter Wars is another I have a soft spot for. Also Rogue/Wrath Squadron.  I, Jedi is pretty good too. 

I'll stop now. &&And Rey looks like Bastilla 

Pole and all&&Kotor mobile is pretty fun&&Maybe Leia lost copyrights to use the Rebellion title.&&A lot more of the flaws of TLJ are inherited from TFA than people want to admit IMO. 

I think a lot of critical appraisal of TFA was muted because if you criticized the movie (at the time) you were seen as playing into the hands of the alt-right people spewing venom against Rey and Finn """"""""because reasons."""""""" 

However TFA is a very problematic film that skates by on breathless action and leaves the sequels to deal with its issues.

The casino scene where Rose soliloquies about the galaxy selling weapons to both sides, after we already saw the Galactic Resistance has a lower staff headcount than a suburban Baskin Robbins, is cinematic nonsense for sure.... but it goes back to TFA's failure to set up the new status quo of the galaxy, how and why we got back to Empire vs Rebels under new names, etc. 

Another good example is how TFA ***deliberately hid*** Luke Skywalker (behind a dumb map mcguffin that was never really justified in-world). The main reason for doing that is to shove the burden onto the next film of explaining what Luke has been up to? - why he hasn't returned to help the Republic? - why has he let the new Empire rise? - why is he in hiding anyway? The answers to all these questions is that Old Luke is a sad guy who failed to bring lasting peace to the galaxy, but it falls to TLJ to explain this, so people blame TLJ instead of TFA for ***""ruining Luke.""*** Actually TFA ruined Luke by setting up the new Empire, canceling the end of ROTJ, showing the rise of a new Sith, and Luke's reaction to all of this is to hide. TFA could have avoided ruining Luke by showing an entirely new threat blindsiding the galaxy that Luke couldn't have had any way to anticipate or prevent, but then they couldn't have made movies about Stormtroopers^TM and Death Stars^TM and Star Destroyers^TM so...

TLJ just tears off the band aid that JJ Abrams put on the Luke character. ***64 year old Luke was never going to start TLJ*** by saying ""Oh, the Republic's in trouble? Cool, thanks for letting me know, girl who I've never met before. I'm going to go be the main character now, you chill here on Game Of Thrones Set Number 42."" And then he does a backflip and kicks Snoke into a space well. Maybe him throwing away the lightsaber was more of a harsh wake up call than the fans deserved (and the milk scene DEFINITELY was), but the point was made. If you thought TLJ ""subverted"" your expectations of what Luke was going to do in this trilogy, your expectations were dumb. However, if anyone pulled the wool over your eyes in that regard, it was certainly JJ Abrams not Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams was the guy who turned Luke into a fetch quest and ended the movie with a ridiculously melodramatic helicopter shot implying the fatefulness of Rey & Luke's encounter. Just like many other things JJ Abrams has had a hand in, his best characteristic as a director and storyteller is getting you excited for what you're *about* to see.

The Force Awakens was ""fun"" if you turned off your brain and just accepted that the ending of ROTJ was canceled and now we get another scrappy rebels vs stormtroopers movie. Unfortunately, you can't make an entire trilogy of stories out of a theme park ride approach to the universe. Eventually you have to deal with character and motivation. TFA only dealt with the OG characters by having Leia comment on how cool Rey is, and then killing off Han as a kick-the-dog moment to establish Kylo's evilness. IMO TLJ gets its share of blame because it also bobbles character and motivation. TFA was a good film from the perspective of setting up Kylo, Rey and Finn. TLJ kind of has these characters running around doing little that advances their character; that's the major difference between TLJ and ESB.&&no time for love dr. jones.&&Not safe for Lucas&&Not Scene Featuring Leia.&&It's not at all bad you'd be fine.

 It's hard to argue that the deaths of hundreds or thousands of Yemenis, the suppression of the rights of many women activists in Saudi Arabia fighting for the things MBS is being praised for bringing about should count less than the sad story of one journalist, who you don't even have any true connection to either (he's not at your Sunday church meet is he?)

If you try to justify this morally (as opposed to just explaining it) you're probably going to end up saying some pretty unfortunate things about the value of those other lives. &&People gatekeeping moral outrage because some of us work and can't sit at home crying over every shitty headline from every newspaper in the world covering the goddamn 7+ billion people that live on this planet are the worst. Who gives a fuck if people weren't outraged before?

Good on Scarlett for sticking to her beliefs. &&yea, what blow to her public image? 
&&I would agree. She hit that part of the ""IT girl"" cycle where they have to hate you for a little while and then you have to do a very good project or make a hilarious self-deprecating cameo to get back in the public's good graces. (e.g. Jennifer Lawrence, Anne Hathaway, Halle Berry, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey)&&As in there was none. She was bullied out of a role that would have shed a needed light onto the trans community...by the trans community. No one faults her for that.&&Completely&&The bullshit with the transgender role she was gonna play, which after she dropped out the movie basically vanished because that's how movies work. &&The stupid [*Rub & Tug* controversy](https://www.thewrap.com/rub-tug-future-film-uncertain-after-scarlett-johanssons-exit/) and her role in *Ghost in the Shell* was heavily-criticized for whitewashing.&&Playing an Asian character in Ghost in the shell and originally accepting the role of a trans person.

I understand people feel like those were overblown, but they cast possibly the most famous white actress in two roles about segments of society who are struggling to get recognised in that industry.&&She's been taking a lot of heat lately after she played Major in the Ghost in the Shell movie when a lot of people wanted a Japanese or Asian woman to play her. Then she almost played a famous transexual and got so much heat for taking the project she dropped out. Not saying I agree with the internet hate towards her or not, just stating that she does have an image problem. Another scandal could really drop her stock.&&> He jailed many women who protested for the right to drive

Best thing there is they protested for right to drive, got arrested, MBS passed law allowing them to drive, women who protested are still in prison & scheduled to have their heads hacked off.

I've also gotten angry or felt bad about some bit of news thousands of times since then, so I don't think it's actually unreasonable for us to forget about things that ""don't affect us."" Realistically, a bus full of kids in another country is much less important to most people than a well-known man who lived in their country and had a reputation etc. I haven't really liked MBS since I first read about him when he started gaining power, but he hasn't really been in the spotlight much recently so I honestly forgot about him and haven't given it much thought unless Saudi Arabia is mentioned. Now for the last three weeks, Saudi Arabia has been the main point of attention, so that gives everyone an opportunity to talk about it again. A lot of people also didn't even hear about the bus full of kids or anything else he did, so this might be their first exposure to MBS doing something egregiously shitty because it's by far the most publicized one.&&He's saying it's reasonable because we literally couldn't function otherwise.

The evidence of western propoganda is clear in the relative difference of the average westerner's knowledge of atrocities in Syria vs atrocities in Yemen.

She backed out of the role.&&She had back-to-back casting controversies, both revolving around her taking on roles that cast her as a traditionally Asian character (Ghost in the Shell), and as a trans man (the now-cancelled 'Rub & Tug'). Both projects even shared the same director.

This gained her a tremendous amount of shit among many of her fans, who felt she was taking roles away from minority actors who already struggle for representation. It also rolled into something of a meme, where ScarJo would ironically be suggested as casting for any minority role. 

It's not a career-ending controversy by any means, but it's safe to say she could use a win right now. &&She could use a hit thats outside the marvel universe but if he's referring to the trans gender movie that got scrapped then he's probably overstating the effect it had.

The LGBT community is pretty annoyed that Hollywood has decided it can monetize their stories/hardships without any (or barely any) kind of meaningful participation in the legwork. The community itself has been plenty effective at efforts to normalize their presence in the mainstream. It's pretty obnoxious that Hollywood thinks it can waltz in at the last minute to make money off something they've had very little part in without involving members of the community where it counts.

Welcome to capitalism.

She chose to look like herself, or what she imagined she would look like, had she had the chance to have a normal human body.

(Although being named Motoko Kusanagi, living in Japan, and being depicted as culturally an average person in Japan are some context clues).

Japanese people in Japan are not interested in representation as much as asians in America are. They see people that look like them all the time in their media. But to cite them and argue that asians in america shouldn't be upset is like saying white people in Canada don't worry about healthcare so white people in the USA shouldn't either.&&Oops, I mean she wasn’t supposed to look Asian. That’s my bad. I agree with you. &&Representation is an America-centric issue. Japanese people (in Japan) obviously don't have the same issue of Japanese representation in film (check [here](https://hlo.tohotheater.jp/net/movie/TNPI3090J01.do) for current movies being shown in Japan). &&I think the people that cried about white washing in the GitS movie never actually looked at GitS in their life before. &&> Japanese people weren't even that upset 

this reminds me when Avril Lavigne put out the Hello Kitty video and everyone was all ""it's racist!"" Except the Japanese, who were all like ""erm no it's not guys""

And, as an anime fan i agree. Some anime characters are soooooooo white. Some are clearly stated to be like Attack on Titan which is set in Europe. But even the ones in Japan, the characters look more caucasian than asian; like if you cast a white guy they'd look more accurate than a japanese casting. Take the leads of Blue Exorcist Rin and Yukio https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IT1lgRspL.jpg they look so white. You could cast Asa Butterfield and any brunette white boy and they'd look more accurate to the anime tbh

May have gone off an a tangent there.........&&The standard rule of thumb is that a movie needs to double its production budget in order to make a profit. So while it wasn't a huge commercial flop, it wasn't profitable either. &&Yeah except the studio probably spent 140 million in marketing and advertisement.

As much as it baffles redditors, people love seeing mirrors of themselves portrayed in movies, especially in movies that reflect on their own backgrounds. And you even proved it in your own comment.

The reason that person was cast is one thing: money. They think the movie will make the most money by having that person play it. It’s not some conspiracy. 

Now why that person would make the most money isn’t a simple topic.&&Wtf yes she is.. stop lying&&Lies, lies from the pit of Hell!&&And I suppose your going to say her name isn't Lucy?&&I'm sorry if I don't get this comment, but wasn't Jennifer Lawrenc ee the lead in Red Sparrow or am I misinterpreting what movie you are talking about?&&Pfft, everyone knows she is a Yale graduate married to an up and coming photographer.

This isnt the same as having to cast a real russian spy to play black widow. This is like how Hollywood casts Chinese people to play Philippino people because to Hollywood, Asian people all look the same.&&The logic is that trans actors are not considered for the same roles as cis actors. So there’s a little more to it than what you’re saying. They’re saying that while trans actors cannot get into the same spaces as cis actors, cis actors are also taking the lone roles that they get relegated to in the first place.

Then there’s also the bit about experience but I think that’s a little more out there as you point out.

EDIT: So people stop leaping down my throat as if I’m personally an idiot or ridiculous: I am stating what the argument is because there seems to be confusion about what the core argument is. That’s it.&&Aside from what others have said, if you're going to make a movie about a trans man the least you could do is hire an actor to play the role, instead of an actress&&I think later it can change when trans people can play cis roles as well. But we are not there yet. What trans person have you seen that’s been offered a lot of roles let alone a cis one? &&She didn’t back out right away.

I would hope that the anger was directed at the people who decided to offer her the role instead of her for accepting it, though.  I don't know if that was the case.

If I really wanted to dream I would also hope that the people outraged had done their research to understand whether or not there was a good reason to offer her the role instead of a trans person before getting upset, but that would be incredibly optimistic (this is a commentary out community outrage and controversy in general, not on the trans community in particular).  I don't know if they had a good reason or if they just wanted to put a big name actor in the role, but it's not impossible that they did.&&Well, it wasn’t only that the role should go to a trans actor (who have almost no opportunities to play cisgender characters) but the fact that they were having a female play a FTM character instead of a male. &&Shame we can't have any more movies about superheroes, serial killers, secret agents, aliens, ghosts, or anything other than rom coms and family dramas. &&The movie is about a trans man, not a trans woman, that's why a woman getting the role was such an issue&&Even if The Major is a robot, the reasoning for a Japanese robotics firm to make it in the form of a white woman is at best, lazy - and at worst, self-loathing. It's a bad look, and the marketing for the film did little to establish the context for the role. It does not make things better that the film explicitly rewrote the ending to have it that the Major is ACTUALLY the brain of a Japanese woman in a white robotic shell - adding another layer to the baffling racial dynamics at play.

As for trans representation, how would making R&T with ScarJo assist representation efforts? The only message it sends is to other cis actors, that playing trans roles is a fast pass to critical acclaim. It establishes to studios that trans actors are not necessary to tell the stories from their own community, further decreasing the number of roles where they have a fair shake at consideration.&&Even Shirow Masamune, the original creator of GiTS approved the casting choice. Ethnic Japanese were fucking HYPED that she was casted. I'm a long time fan of the franchise and I genuinely believe that the American adaptation took a really smart direction with the film. &&Thank you! My god, people are insensistive.

I don’t know why people think they have the right to be telling people of minority demographics what they should think when they aren’t part of their group. You haven’t experienced what they’ve experienced... so why do you feel entitled to tell them how they should be reacting?

And I hate how some people will memorize specific minorities that have reactions that align with their views and bring them up to justify why you, a person of that minority group, shouldn’t be reacting a certain way. “X asian person said that they don’t care about getting white washed, so why should you? Man, you have such a persecution complex SMH”&&I've watched Stand Alone Complex, and didn't like what was happening with that movie.&&Guessing the person you replied to had downvoted you. You are correct. The rule of thumb is to double production budget to include marketing, so no profit is typically made until you make it over that double mark. &&You also do realise that ancient Egyptians look nothing like modern day Egyptians right?&&I just snorted at work.

Sure some of them might preach to their neighbors about Muslim sins, but I am sure some of them don't give a shit, they were just born into a theocracy.

If it is made it’ll just be thrown onto the cheapo straight-to-Netflix LGBTQ movie pile &&To your point, remember Boy's Don't Cry?  I think the trans community would agree that movie was very positive for them.  Yet Hilary Swank is not trans.&&""not having the story told at all"" is not necessarily a bad thing in the eyes of some members of the LGBT community.

the question of ""damaging representation vs no representation"" is a longstanding question that lots of people in the LGBT community have different opinions about. 

I'm not trans so I can't speak for the trans community in particular, but I personally would rather have no gay representation in a movie than shitty representation. 

A film making a character into a lazy damaging stereotype is worse (in my opinion) than that character not existing at all. &&Given that it was a story about an FtM crimelord, I feel we'll be just fine without it. I don't see any good reason to celebrate the life of a gangster, pimp, and sex trafficker. 

I've got nothing against Johansson for her involvement, though. A jobs a job and all that, and it wouldn't have really *upset* me had the film gone as planned. 

But for christ sake, I'll never understand what they were thinking when they decided to cast her. [It's no exaggeration to say that Donald fucking Trump bears a stronger resemblance to the person she was cast as than she does.](http://www.dagospia.com/img/foto/07-2018/dante-tex-gill-1-1037297.jpg)&&Considering some reports said that the plot of the movie was going to be changed to have her character be a lesbian instead of a transman, it's really better off not being told. &&I can agree in part to this, but you have to also admit that the role of an Asian man isn't really her place to play.

I personally think that we would be better off if the movie went forward, but our main concern was one of representation. It's like casting a white person and putting them in blackface instead of casting a black person instead.

Employment discrimination is such a real issue facing our community, and instead of casting a trans man to play the role of a trans man, they got a cis woman. This not only pushes trans people out of the industry, (if they won't cast a trans person for a trans role, then when will they?) but also has the underlying mindset that trans men are 'actually' women. Which is transphobic and counterproductive to our cause. 

Anyway, there are a bunch of reasons the community was displeased. Whatever I personally feel, I do think there are some valid concerns. 

&&Most of the discussion from trans people was that no representation is better than bad representation. &&I'd imagine that if you asked trans people what they want, they (most but not all) would either want a) the story to be told the right way with preferred representation, or b) not told at all&&Which really sucks from a movie goer’s standpoint because on top of being an opportunity for the trans community to have more representation in movies, it also just sounded like a genuinely interesting premise for a movie.

You think the actual Japanese fans were pissed that they got such a big name for their film?&&Gender wise Scarlett is the same gender as the trans character.&&[deleted]&&I couldn't find official response from Shirow himself.  Only director for the adapted animation and the director of the film claiming as such but here's a rebuttal of the other side.  

https://medium.com/@StPaco/10-telling-details-from-the-ghost-in-the-shell-comics-that-reveal-motoko-was-actually-whitewashed-3a52ffd93a7a

&&To me it’s like when Mickey Rooney played a Japanese man. Or like when Emma Stone played that Hawaiian pilot, there are tons of examples. &&Trans people are also 0.004% of the population. SAG, according to google, has 124,000 members total. You have to consider how many of these are in SAG but not working, bit players, extras etc. But even if, somehow, all of those actors were actively out working, that would mean you'd have about 500 total actors if those trans people were equally represented in Hollywood, which is a fucking stretch to assume so. 

Now, out of those presumed 500 trans actors, which I'd wager is probably about 1/3 to 1/4th that number, **if that**, you'd need one of them to be able to carry a film and gain financing with the same star power as SJO to get the movie made. 

So, yeah. Fucking complete and utter dream scenario.&&But by them also drawing this distinction, I am prepared to relegating trans people to only trans roles. 

See, they should have made an example out of this by first supporting ScarJo in the role, then starting a discussion that it should be equally cool for then to play cis equal roles.&&Did Jared Leto attract the same criticism for Dallas Buyers Club? Or is it ok when a cis man plays a trans woman, but not a cis woman? Interesting.&&The problem, atleast in mainstream cinema, is that the attractiveness of the actor/actress counts for a lot and on average trans people are less attractive. I'll likely get downvoted to fuck for it but it's the truth.  I think the best chance of trans people getting into acting is when medicine/surgery reach a level where more of them are passable in their preferred gender.&&I'd wager that a large amount of the people kicking up a fuss won't even go see the movie if it's made with a very low budget and genuine trans actor &&It’s her production company, so she wasn’t offered the role. She just decided she would play that character. And it really isn’t the right character for her. Just look up the real guy, Dante “Tex” Gill.&&That sounds fair&&> As for trans representation, how would making R&T with ScarJo assist representation efforts?

Jared Leto won an Oscar for playing a trans woman in Dallas Buyers Club, and his portrayal received critical acclaim. Some people were upset then too, but it help shine a light on how the AIDS epidemic has harmed the Trans community.&&> the Major is ACTUALLY the brain of a Japanese woman in a white robotic shell

Sort of like a woman trapped in a man's body?&&For trans representation, I'd think it would be obvious that it's would be a high profile thing sympathetic to their cause. And I'm guessing it would be pretty easy to have other trans characters that actual trans actors could play, giving them exposure.

Instead apparently the project is getting scrapped, because of a vocal minority who did themselves a disservice.

And from what I hear, people in Japan loved her casting, including the series creator. &&> to make it in the form of a white woman is at best

She's intentionally ethnically ambigious. 

> adding another layer to the baffling racial dynamics at play.

That's the point. Ghost in the Shell. Inner self vs external identity. Go check out what Masamune Shirow has to say about the themes of GiTS.&&I remember some YouTube video where they interviewed Japanese people right on the streets of Tokyo, polling people about ScarJo as Major, and I don't think I saw a single negative comment said. It's like the only people who got offended were white people in the US.&&I wish people who argue over some girls that dress in Chinese dress and got called out for cultural appropriation would see your comment. 

Because I remember it clearly since most of them said the Asians in America were stupid for saying that, Chinese people in mainland don't even care at all and though that those girls can pulled it off.  &&Me too but I usually do it in the bathroom stalls like everyone else.&&You know, it's that movie where that one guy teaches math to inner city students.&&Lmao sideburns is a totally underrated character, billy likes to drink soda... miss lippys car.... is green!

Ironic.&&So would you agree that straight characters should only be played by straight actors?&&I want to ask, from a place of genuine curiosity and no kind of transphobia - would it be acceptable to get a cis male actor to play this role (as the subject of the movie identified as a male), or is it offensive unless it's a trans person? &&That's making the assumption that a straight person can't play a trans character, is that a precedent trans people want to set?

Can only straight people play straight characters then? How deep does this go? Can a white writer develop a black character? 

Once you think about this for more than a few minutes you realize how patently stupid these stances are.&&Tell the story right, for sure, but why must the actor be trans ?  Was Hilary Swank wrong for Boys Don't Cry, or Tim Curry wrong for Rocky Horror, or William Hurt wrong for Kiss of the Spider Woman ?

Actors play characters; they do a convincing, compelling job of it, or they do it badly; that's all that matters.&&I suppose you could have a non trans person playing the character, but then it would all just be an act, they would just be pretending to have these experiences. And i certainly dont watch movies and tv to see people pretend to be someone they arent

Edit: have to add a /s because apparently some people thought I was actually that stupid&&I wouldn't either ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&I would have if only because anime to live action never goes well.&&They didn’t care at all.  It’s a Western movie so they expect Western actors.

Motoko isnt supposed to look Japanese either; she  is a brain encased in a cyborg body. A major, major theme of the work is about identity and self.

The people outraged by this apparently didn’t know anything about the story. They just heard someone with a Japanese name was being portrayed by a white girl.&&It's the same problem Speedy Gonzales and Apu had, fans from the actual countries love them but Americans find them all racist.&&Well, those are two very different examples there (one being a racist caricature and the other just lazy casting looking for another big star for the role) but yeah, I agree lol. &&Your math is off, but that’s understandable because fractional percentages can be tricky. 

If SAG has 124k members, and trans Americans make up 0.004% of the population, then there would only be about 5 trans actors in SAG if SAG membership mirrored the general population. 

For there to be 500 trans actors SAG would need 12.4 million members, or trans people would need to make up 0.4% of the population. 

In reality, it’s estimated that 0.6% of the American population is transgendered [(source - PDF warning)](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf)

Regardless, your math ends up being pretty close to capturing the right amount of transgendered actors SAG should represent if SAG mirrored the general population, which is hilarious to me.&&Jamie Clayton would have schooled Redmayne at Danish Girl&&There have been tons of trans films the past decade, Redmayne and Leto have won oscars playing transwomen. Ttrans people can't even score trans roles, there's no way they are getting cis roles any time soon. Baby steps.&&It already is cool for trans to play cis roles. Only if there's 70 trans actors competing for a cis role, there's a hundred thousand cis actors competing for the same role. Like in sports, many female athletes are better than a whole lot of men, but if they compete against the best men their results are sorely disappointing.&&He did in the same circles as this backlash is coming from, but en masse it wasn’t an issue being discussed yet. I think it’s also VERY important to recognize where we are at socially then vs now. If anything, his win had something of a galvanizing effect to the problem. And socially, trans visibility is leaps further than it was then even though it was pretty recently. So no, it’s not sexist in this case because he was called out but the conversation was not really being had. If you ask these same people mad now about this about Leto, believe me, they remember and do NOT support him in any way shape or form (and not just because he’s a fucking creep otherwise) and will point to Dallas Buyer’s Club as the problematic point. But who was talking about trans issues and activism the way we are now a few years back? Not as many people. Hell, gay marriage hadn’t even passed yet.

A better person to mention would be Eddie Redmayne who largely did *not* have backlash of any kind. And I think there’s a number of reasons why he went without exception.&&Ironically, the constant stream of outrage and righteous anger is doing more than anything else to turn people off to their message. 

There's another movie being made based on a manga, and people were furious that they cast all white actors. The manga was set in Germany. Wish I remembered what it was called.&&",2018-10-24 17:40:54

*“Basically, my character has been in a living hell since ’85 and lost everything. The script reintroduces him as a pretty damaged character, emotionally, and somebody who’s suffered a lot physically from a hard life. I can identify with that quite easily. The physical part [and] the emotional part.*

*“It’s become an iconic character. People quote him and have T-shirts. I didn’t want to mess with that image. I didn’t see a way, up until now, that it would work. But obviously now when I’m old enough, suddenly I work as a parent. The father-son concept was quite good because I had a violent relationship with my dad [...] many men do and end up in contact sports.”*

No upper limit in boxing! so could be huge

Creed doesnt (fight at heavyweight), so this kind of thing is pretty unlikely unless its part of the storyline. Sometimes grudge matches happen at open weight. &&Pretty sure everything in Rocky IV was an exhibition match. So like the fight with Thunderlips. &&In the movies Rocky competed at heavyweight, the highest weight class in boxing, but Stallone being 5'10"" makes him more of a candidate for a lower weight class. The movie just rolls with it rather than get bogged down in the size differences. &&Honestly pumped for this movie after seeing Creed.

*Sigh*

Those were simpler times&&Wasn’t the Thunderlips fight in Rocky 3 🤔&&Tyson is 5'10 ish too to be fair and was a heavyweight &&Totally. It makes more sense in Rocky I, when he's just some random hardworking schlubby bum in the mid-1970s, when the division started at 175 lbs, than it does by the time you get to Rocky III or Rocky IV, when he's this big global celebrity in the mid 1980s, heavyweights start at 200 lbs, and he has 4% bodyfat and is supposed to be the best boxer who ever lived or something.

And it helps that at the time people thought shorter movie stars like Stallone and Tom Cruise were taller than they were, and that Talia Shire is only 5'4"" and Carl Weathers is only 6'1"".

And of course it makes sense to compare him to Rocky Marciano, given the name and ethnicity and all - who was also small - and that was a totally different era for a bunch of reasons.&&I hope they bring that back up in Creed 2.

Google Chuck Wepner.  Wepner was the ""real rocky""  who was knocked out by Muhammed Ali in the 15th round of a fight.

&&How can you say that? They meticulously document the snow running wood chopping training program in a sweet montage.&&No, he got it from punching meat. That’s how legends are made, with the punching of meat.&&Time to harvest!&&_BEEFCAAAAAAAAAKE_

((DX)*  <-- that's my Cartman emoticon&&Yes but Stallone wouldn't have made the minimum requirement to fight at HW, especially in the later movies. He was so ripped up in Rocky 4, there was no way he was close to 200 pounds, which is the lower limit. (Lower than 200 you are fighting at cruiserweight.)

Stallone was probably like 180 max in Rocky 4 and Dolph Lungren legit looked 240. 

So there was some bullshit there. Mr. T was also way bigger, so was Tommy Morrison. &&Pro boxing just did it in a different way. Instead of creating a super heavyweight division, they called the super heavyweight division ""heavyweight"" and made up the cruiserweight division for the old-school, smaller heavyweights.&&The discussion gets brought up every few years in boxing but heavyweight is already a pretty shallow division as it is, so there would be a really small amount of people in a super heavyweight division world wide. &&God damnit Genki. That entrance lol. 
&&I like that Sudo immediately asked Butterbean if he's okay. Good man.&&Cmon man. Its the Ultimate MALE!&&Yeah, like the no killing rule was really slacked on &&Stallone was pretty thick in the first movie.&&He was a girthy lad&&God, that makes so much perfect sense &&It was a ""The Dark Knight Rises"" reference&&He’s into wing chun&&How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?&&Creed was such an amazing surprise for me.  I've always liked the Rocky movies, but I was never crazy about them.  They were just good movies I enjoyed. On an overnight flight I decided to give it a shot and was blown away.  I thought it was going to be a cash grab. It was not.

It's so well done.  &&[deleted]&&He’s not gonna make it&&Yep.

I thought you were going to say they didn't pick him because he was too Small and they wanted a big guy like Dolph. LOL. And that's the other part of why I love Rocky movies, as absurd and fantasized they can seem at times, they also have very strong roots in grounding the world to be believable. Like in the last 2006 Rocky where he fights. that movie honestly shouldn't have been so good. Any other franchise or actor or story and it would've seemed so absurd. But it was done in such a way you could just barely believe it. Which makes it great.&&Imagine saying ""Dolph, you're hired because you look smaller and weaker.""&&I actually did not know that and counting my upvotes many others did not as well, that makes them a lot more believable now. thank you for educating me&&Don't they have super heavyweight in boxing?&&I guess the only limit is willingness to fight a giant. &&He drink Soviet milk comrade &&What are you talking about? It was a documentary about how Rocky ended the Cold War. No one can prove this didn’t happen.&&yes I just showcased my ignorance to everyone I had no idea that heavyweight had no upper limit, honestly after learning that all the Rocky movies seem way more believable in terms of weight class&&Rocked him, too. God, I love boxing. &&I can see a scenario where he wants to jump up a division for [reason] and the movie will be about the difference in weight and size, and him having to use his speed and quick thinking to overcome it with Rocky afraid he'll die like his father did against a much more powerful opponents.&&That in fact is cruiserweight. Anything from 176 to 200.

Rocky I: 178 pounds

Rocky II: 200 pounds

Rocky III: 163 pounds (current middleweight!)

Rocky IV: 173 pounds&&There is no minimum requirement to fight at Heavyweight. A smaller guy could always fight at a higher weight class if he chooses to do so, but being lighter is usually a huge disadvantage so you don’t see many fighters who are weighing less fighting at heavyweight.&&Right, it’s just semantics. The limit is pretty small though. 

For instance: 
- weightlifting: 109kg+(240#) is the heaviest class
- powerlifting: variable with federation, but it’s usually something like 140kg+ (308#)
- boxing: I saw elsewhere in the thread it’s 200#/91kg? Just seems light, even though I’m well aware boxers are generally lightly build compared to lifters &&In Rocky 3 he’s 190 so he’d be classified as a cruiser weight. &&Entrance Compilation!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRjCfdJbb6g&&He was never Tyson thick though.

Forward, always.&&I remember seeing pictures of Scott Hall looking like absolute hell. I'm glad he got help&&Dolph is taller, but Koloff at the time was much thicker, more muscular.&&Google some picture of “Nikolai Valuev” . 7.0 ft, 328 lb, looks like a Bond villain!&&Maybe now. That wasn't a thing until the mid 80s.

Rocky 4 came out in 1985.  The 1984 Olympics were when the Super Heavyweight class was introduced.  They were probably in the middle of making Rocky 4 when the Olympics happened.  &&'Super Heavyweight' is a class in amateur boxing. In professional boxing 'heavyweight' is the heaviest class and there is no upper weight limit. &&Hulk Hogan did it front of 20,000 screaming Hulkamaniacs when he body slammed the 800 lb Andre the Giant brother&&Yeah, none of this pasteurized bullshit. In Soviet Russia milk drinks you. &&Or he gonna get his ass beat and Creed III: Revenge of the Creed is his comeback story&&Tbf actual boxers in that weight range (180-190lbs) would cut to either 168lbs/super middleweight or 175lbs/light heavyweight, cruisers cut to <200lbs and are proably ~210-220 on the night.&&And now admit that it’s a documentary and Rocky ended the Cold War. &&Holy cow he was 173 looking like that at 5'10''? WOW&&Yeah, in boxing it does get pretty crazy. In Deontay Wilder's recent successful title defense against Luis Ortiz, Ortiz outweighed the champ by 26 pounds, even though the champ was 3 inches taller. And the  champ, not Ortiz, was the more powerful puncher. Wilder was also 6 years younger though, which maybe makes up some of it.&&Current UFC would never allow this much fun to be had.

Not even golden boy Conor could get away with something like that.&&what just happened&&Agreed, but just want to point out for clarity's sake that Stallone didn't make Creed, and I believe that he was even a little against continuing to mess with the Rockiverse initially. From what I understand, after it was a success, he took over the reigns for Creed II.

2) Robin Hood: Men in Tights

I love Robin Hood, and I love Taron Egerton, but this version looks like a CGI shitfest.

Like, I would imagine Taron still has a stunt double for Robin Hood.

I remember that after the first Avengers movie came out, some people were criticizing Jeremy Renner's form, saying that some of his draws just didn't seem to have the right weight and such. It turned out that for insurance reasons they couldn't actually have him shooting arrows when there was even the slightest chance he could hit anybody real or something important (this was mostly the green screen portion of the NY battle, after all, so it was in a studio), so he basically just had to mime most of attacks. Still, he got the training, since there's both the mental aspect involved and also the fact that if there was a scene where he wasn't just miming he didn't want to look like an idiot. &&Idk how well the ""fighting skills"" would work irl without choreography or the other guy pulling punches.&&[deleted]&&“Hey Blinkin!”

I must have a fox thing. &&Literally a fox&&They've been around since the 70s and 80s though and I don't think any of the Burton/Schumacher films were reboots.&&No defense of Anderson, but super low draw bows are pretty standard in Hollywood. You don't really need them to do any actual damage, plus you can have the actor keep them drawn almost indefinitely, which is very useful in a variety of situations. &&Lars Andersen did train him for the movie so it makes sense&&Lars Andersen is such a goof. Even without knowing anything about archery, it's pretty obvious that his bows wouldn't be very useful IRL.&&Easier to use on horseback.&&Not sure if it's Mongolian, but it's definitely a recurve bow at the least&&It's a very low draw weight bow. That makes it easy to train with, fast to use and not tiring, but it's nothing at all like the bows used in ancient warfare.

A typical target shooting recurve bow is around 35lbs of draw weight (the one in the video is less still). An Olympic compound bow is around 50lbs to draw. Ancient bows used in warfare had draw weights between 80 and 120lbs depending on when and who was making them, but they were all at about the practical limits of what you can do with a bow. At those weights you need to have trained your whole life and continue to train in order to use it effectively. Whether you used a longbow or a composited recurve or something in between came down to what materials you had available and where and how you intended to use the weapon.
&&> Correct me if I’m wrong but it looks like it’s based off of Mongolian bows

It is just a recurve bow. Not all recurve bows are mongol bows by default.

> more powerful than European short-bows

Composite bows are more efficient than selfbows, but Europeans also had composite bows, and any bow of any kind can be made a certain draw weight so them being more powerful by default is false.

&&This one is Korean style, Mongolian bows were/are larger and the reason they were stronger than regular wood bows of that size is because they used  a layer of horn on the inside, sinew on the outside and a thin piece of wood in the middle. (Korean bows also used horn/sinew but modern ones are of course fiberglass)

But it's more than just writing for it, it's the actor, director, and often-left-out editors, that have to come together.  Most people know that the average scene is dozens spliced together, but think about that in the context of reloads and rounds fired.  Ugggghh, editors job is already hard enough.&&Kevin Costner did something similar for the same reason in Dances with Wolves. In the scene where the Pawnee attacks the village he only shoots 5 shots (there might be a sixth shot put in as a sound effect though while he is off picture, because he is the only one with a pistol and the others uses rifles and carbines) 

As he then rides up behind a fleeing Pawnee his gun clicks, he looks at it and throws it away. 

Costner mentions in the making of documentary that he hates when filmmakers dont keep count on how many shots have been fired, so he made sure the amount was correct.&&He also is seems like a complete mensch and one of the nicest people to work with in Hollywood.

Chris Pratt I think is the latter - he's letting go a bit but overall he wants the ""ranger"" physique to remain a commodity for action films. I can't see him willingly deviating from that for roles that call for it until he gets too old for action films.

Christian Bale on the other hand, does things to his body that health-consious people (and most of the medical community) really would not recommend you do. Yo-yoing between top physical form for Batman, then emanciated for The Machinist, then back to top physical form, losing that form again for The Fighter *and now* he's got fat weight for Vice. He's not the only actor that's gone through such drastic changes or willingly put their body through that kind of harm for the job.

And the sword fight at the end he turns into slapstick genius while Costner is putting on a legit hero battle (and it is a good fight).

It's definitely funnier the second time seeing it. How his one brain cell not intently focused on Jackson remembers to close his mouth&&They’ve tried this so many times. But the one thing they haven’t tried? Actually retelling the original story with a modern movie. The closest they’ve come is Prince of Thieves and they added all kinds of shit. 

Tell the Robin Hood story...with the archery contest, him busting into the dining hall with the deer on his shoulders, all of it. 

You’re right. They keep doing the same thing with the Arthurian legends. Changing the time period, backstory, entire story thinking that somehow it will make it more appealing. That Russel Crowe Robin Hood movie was the most blatant example of this...and that movie that made Arthur a Roman soldier....

It’s not like kids are reading Robin Hood and His Merry Men or Ivanhoe or seeing Erol Flynn movies anymore...they don’t know the original damn story. &&I think this might be it. I'd love to see a new, epic movie about King Arthur or other old stories, but every time I see a tagline with something like ""the untold story"" or something like that, a little piece of me dies inside.&&It falls in the bucket of other failed movies like King Arthur (2017), Ben-Hur (2016), and Hercules (2014).

Watching the trailer, you can't help but see a 30% Rotten Tomato score. This movie will be forgotten until they make another Robin Hood movie in ten years.&&This is it - these movies are just too slick and clean-edged. They're afraid to embrace an older aesthetic and it just seems so shiny and over produced. Too much modern humor and quips. You could get me interested if they made a Robin Hood movie that just seemed more like a backwoods tale of some dirty guys living in the woods. Not this pretty boy and cool guy Jamie Foxx, with perfect clean teeth and cool outfits. The action is too perfectly choreographed, the camera work is pristine, it just feels like a modern heist movie, when it should feel like a scrappy and off-the-cuff buddy movie.

Also, though he is amazing at playing a villain, I kinda feel like Ben Mendelsohn is being a bit typecast. It reminds me of when Mark Strong was the villain in every movie for awhile there and it just got incredibly boring. At least give him a different angle or personality - in the trailers he looks like exactly the same villainous character he played in Rogue One, down to his haircut and everything. I think he really shines when he plays someone who's rotten but smarmy and less outright monstrous, such as his slimy druggie character in Killing Them Softly.&&Also, it's hard watching the trailer and seeing so many of the costumes that look like normal or modern clothes. It's hard to take a movie set ""hundreds of years ago"" seriously when I'm pretty sure I own the same pair of pants that Robin Hood is wearing.&&Oi! I've also come to show my support for King Arthur.  &&I liked it as well. &&This so much. That movie is just plain fun to watch. I absolutely love it and it saddens me that it didn't do well enough to franchise.&&It was a great movie. I remember an early trailer that was super stylized with cool music, and it made me want to watch it.

Closer to release there was another trailer and it was the most generic thing I had ever seen. Kind of killed my hype and I didn't see it in theaters.

Saw it much later at home, and it was awesome - the first trailer was a much more accurate portrayal of the real movie.

Cool, name it something different then Robin Hood. Quick Google told me there are **NINE** movies with Robin Hood in the title, and thats not even including the ones that are named something different but are really just Robin Hood movies.

It was still badass though.&&I will say this on the ""handgun with 20 bullets"" goofs. Sometimes is the director/editor following the film making rule of ""the audience can fill in the blanks, don't let petty details break the scene flow. For example, showing  reloading could break the flow of the scene. And the dirrector is letting the audience pickup that a reload happened offscreen when the action was cut away from the one actor.

In other scenes, showing reloads can be purposeful in the same way. Take John Wick, Collateral or Heat, three of the major ""did guns well"" movies. They're impressing upon the audience that these guys are hard hitting professionals. The cartoon Archer does this *extremely* well too FYI. In that, showing gun handling correctly is part of character development. 

Of course, there are movies that completely fuck the dog at doing either with actual legitimate goofs. For example, Tombstone is great...but Doc Holiday shoots a double barrel shotgun 3 times and its very obvious that he didn't reload. &&In American Gangster, when Russel Crowe is running through the projects I swear he racks like 30 fucking shells out of his shotgun.

Costner told it in interviews.

In the scene, Rickman fights Costner with Locksley's father's sword that he's kept since killing him in the first scene of the movie. When Rickman brandishes this sword, he holds it up for the viewers to see and exclaims ""Remember this?!"" and all of the viewers are like ""Oh dude, it's that sword from the beginning...""

Funny thing is is that the sword in question kept breaking on the set while they were fencing. There was a lot of sword-on-sword blows in the shots and the sword would repeatedly snap during takes so they'd have to fix it and reshoot. This led to the actors busting out into laughing fits every time Rickman held up the damn sword that kept breaking and yelling ""Remember this?!""&&I think Rickman saw he was in a scene where he would attempt to violently rape his new wife with his mother watching anticipating him impregnating her with her grandchild and thought he can't take it too seriously.&&I always imagine Alan Rickman being just like his character in Galaxy Quest throughout the filming of Robin Hood.  Just completely exasperated at both the material and cast.  &&I agree, the movie was great and I hold it up there with Men in Tights.

I fucking love *The Postman*. Prepare for a geek out!  

I've actually read the novel it's based on, and it's *completely different*, sharing nothing but a basic premise, with virtually none of the same characters, story, etc. - so I'll brook none of this ""The book was better!"" nonsense. Even David Brin himself has said that each should stand on its own merits, because they're clearly thoroughly different stories.  

That being said...the movie version of *The Postman* has some truly terrific, subtle, elegant world-building, the kind of thing that lets you understand the context and feel like there's a whole history to this world, without someone having to sit down and lecture the protagonist (standing in for the audience) about ""how we got here"" or some shit like that. As just a couple of examples: when the postman and Bill are walking across some desolate flatlands and come across an abandoned floating dock, just sitting in this desert, and take a second to jump on the now-surreal diving board. Or, my personal favourite: when General Bethlehem, having been informed that the forces opposing him are that of ""the United States government,"" angrily replies that ""There *is no* ""United States government;"" I was *at* the Battle of Georgetown, and I *watched* the White House burn!"" That's the only mention of what is obviously a *massive* culmination of tremendous historical events in the whole movie - that one little line - and yet, it tells us so much about this setting, this character, the whole history of this world, in a way that is not the least bit didactic or inelegant.  

All that aside, though, there is one perfect thing about *The Postman* which means that I will have to love it forever, no matter what: [the casting of Tom Petty, *playing himself*, as the mayor of post-apocalyptic Portland, OR.](#spoiler)  

[Let's unpack that for a second, shall we? And remember: *nothing remotely like that is in the book*. This means that there once was a screenwriter, writing a movie in the 1990s, set in US Pacific Northwest, but in post-apocalyptic 2013. One of the significant locations of the story is ""Bridge City"" (presumably the remnants of Portland)...and this screenwriter, *for no reason other than that it would be weird and cool*, writes *Tom fuckin' Petty*, of Heartbreakers fame, into the script as the mayor of Bridge City. Not Tom Petty, actor, *playing* this character; rather, *in this fictional post-apocalyptic world*, Tom Petty *the person* has somehow found himself the mayor of Bridge City...such that our protagonist, the unnamed postman, upon encountering him during his first visit to Bridge City, basically says, *in character*, ""Holy shit! You're Tom Petty! Man, you were really famous before *our entire civilization collapsed!* Hey, if I found a guitar amongst all this rubble, would you maybe play, like, an acoustic version of 'Running Down a Dream' or something?""](#spoiler)  

[*What an amazing thing to write into a movie like this!* Besides being hilariously entertaining and sort of unprecedented in such a somber atmosphere, it also (somehow) even adds a weird dose of realism to the setting. Like...why *wouldn't* Tom Petty survive the collapse of civilization in the US? And why *wouldn't* people still remember that he used to be a famous rock star? And, in the new absence of mass media networks and the kind of celebrity we're used to...why wouldn't he instead apply his natural charisma and love for his fans toward a political career caring for the remaining citizens of Bridge City? For some reason, I can't imagine this working if it had been, say, Mick Jagger or David Bowie or...Dee Snider? But for some reason, it *totally works* with Tom Petty!](#spoiler)

Also me: see .gif&&Hey, I think Robin Hood: Men in Tights was definitely the greatest telling of the story in modern times. It had the dinner scene, archery contest, chastity belt, you name it!&&A fairly common theory is that the character of King Arthur was (at least partially) based on a Romano-British commander though. Not that most people watching the movie would know that. You’re right about one thing for sure, most in modern audiences are vaguely familiar with old tales at best.&&There is no single ""canonical"" version of these characters.  They're fanfics of fanfics of fanfics in every iteration.

Imho, the best is to focus on the most ""classic"" version of the character and build from there.  For ""Robin Hood""?  That's Flynn and the furry Disney movie.  Throw in a Moorish sidekick as a nod to Freeman's character in the Costner movie.&&> they don’t know the original damn story.

Isn't the biggest problem with these old stories, though, that there is no **the original** story? Both Arthur and Robin Hood were folk tales whose stories were told across centuries with authors adding new bits here and there.

In the case of Arthur, do you go back the old Welsh/Breton poems and try to piece together a narrative from those? Do you use the first full narrative in *Historia Regum Britanniae* which ends with Arthur conquering the Roman Empire? Or do you go to the last full medieval retelling of the legend in *Le Morte d'Arthur*, where Arthur is barely even the focus?

There are similar issues with Robin Hood. At what time is it set (i.e., is Richard the Lionheart the king or not)? Is he a commoner or a nobleman? Does he rob from the rich to give to the poor? Should Maid Marian and Friar Tuck be included?

In the end, I think the problems with the various newer adaptations is not that they get the story ""wrong"", it's that they are too focused on telling the ""real"" story that they don't focus on telling a **good** story. I really wouldn't care what version of Robin Hood or King Arthur a person told as long as it was captivating.&&Okay, but it's not like the Arthurian legends are even Canon with themselves.

When they said Robin Hood, I felt deflated&&I want to see a mix of Logan Lucky and Game of Thrones for a Robin Hood film. &&Honestly one of the few reasons I want to see it....well that and a live action jasmine &&And the way he draws his light-weight bow halfway. Good luck hurting anyone in armor with that.

On top of all of this, when he's not shooting a bow, dude looks like a newborn calf on ice. Gotta be the most wacky looking guy I've ever seen.&&Also since Daniel Craig is James Bond he can get an Aston Martin anytime he wants for the rest of his life.

Edit: looks like that is just a myth I thought was true. He does get to test drive them on an Aston Martin track when he wants to though it looks like. He just doesn't get them for free I believe. &&I think it depends. If you learned from the age of 5 to 18 then stopped playing and picked it up at 30, you’d probably easily be able to get back into it.

But if you spent 3 months on it - even intensely - I feel like you’d struggle to pick it back up even after a couple of months. &&For instance, I hadn't raced BMX for roughly 10 years, but started up again a few weeks ago and it is all coming back to me. It's like riding a bike!&&Can confirm...I haven't touched the saxophone in earnest since college, but I yanked it out the other day and while my embouchure is definitely weaker, I still know all the notes, can read the music, remember the breath control, etc and can still play respectably well.&&Been a massive fan of those novels since 1997 (read the first one as a teenager) and I had misgivings about Cruise as Reacher but he absolutely fucking nailed it, his physical size just wasn't an issue at all.

Shame the second one wasn't as good a film (still a decent action movie but less focus on his intelligence).&&I loved the first movie. It was such a neat little actioner that was just long enough to do everything and didn't overstay your welcome by being too long&&I think they got the intelligence part wrong in that he was seemingly infallible. After having read a few Jack Reacher novels, I realized that while he is really intelligent, he's wrong just as often as he's right simply because of lack of overall information. His guesses are good based on evidence provided but at the end of the day they're still just guesses. In the movie, there's a few times when the bad guys are a step or two ahead of him, but there really isn't ever a time where he makes a mistake. If he deduces something, he's right. Also, I haven't read that many of the books but I don't think he is supposed to have a photographic memory either, as is demonstrated when he recites the serial number of the rifle without writing it down.

The other thing I realized is that Lee Child really is as bad at gun facts as people say he is.&&Mann uses the actual production gunshot sounds from the take.  He doesn't replace them in post like many other films.  The gunfight in Heat is another great example.  Not only do you get the gunfire, but you get all of the echos as well.


edit: https://youtu.be/gW0yebyGk-8?t=272&&I'm pretty sure something like that was also done in Mad Max Fury Road when Max was fighting Furiosa. Definitely a cool detail for those who see it. &&Oh shit that's the host of Forged in Fire&&Cheers, i suck at phone posting.&&Hang onto my nuts, I'm a seal!!!!&&That's what the ranger does, what Frank did was clever cadaver use to escape.

This movie is fucking hilarious on rewatches. It's basically a movie of Tim Allen putting other people in danger as he just wings it the entire way. &&Hey Abbott!&&""A JEWWWW?""

""Nah that's my name man""&&I haven't seen the Flynn version - is the foppish nature of Prince John a thing in that, or is that more of a send-up of his infantile behavior in the Disney furry version?&&Yup, he was Will Scarlet, Robin's half brother.

~~That didn't make much sense as a plot point, thinking about it now.~~

Check out /u/haceldama, his explanation makes more sense:

>After Robin's mom died his dad had a fling with a village girl. Robin threw a fit until his father abandoned the girl, who was pregnant by then. Then he still refused to forgive his dad and ran off to join the crusades to further punish him for betraying his mom's memory.&&Interesting because Sean Connery played Robin Hood in Robin and Marian with Audrey Hepburn. &&I was at that perfect age too where the action was fun paced, the music got me all amped, and some of the more hollywood aspects I didn't care about.  

Also, my friend had the entire Sherwood Forrest set and that was the shit to play with. &&Fun fact - that Sherwood Forest playset was almost entirely a reuse of the molds of the Ewok Village playset from 1983.

It’s everything you’d ask for in a swashbuckling fight - flashing swords, shadows playing against the scenery, using the set as a weapon, trading one-liners, serious athleticism, high stakes.

James Gunn Boards ‘Suicide Squad 2’ To Write And Possibly Direct,50580,9mrva1,https://deadline.com/2018/10/james-gunn-boards-suicide-squad-2-to-write-and-possibly-direct-1202479455/,6246,1539110844.0,,"Hollywood Reporter writer

>Being told that Gunn's SUICIDE SQUAD will not be a sequel, he will have a whole new take on it. But whether that means a total recasting or not is unclear.

**EDIT:** Well, this is my most upvoted comment ever.  Hooray~&&He said, ""welcome to the frickin' Suicide Squad."" Only, he didn't use ""*frickin*.'"" &&Well excitement for Suicide Squad 2 is not something I expected to feel today.&&If they give him as much freedom as Disney/Marvel gave him with Guardians this could be something pretty special.&&Er, I guess this is curtains [for Leto's joker](https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2018/05/james-gunn.png)&&#* BAUTISTA

&&This is a brilliant move. Suicide Squad really should've been DC's Guardians of the Galaxy equivalent.&&DC doing something right.&&James Gunn: “Fuck Marvel!”


David Ayer: “MY MAN!”&&2-weeks later:

""Dave Bautista joins cast of Suicide Squad 2""&&My main hope for SS 2 is that they keep the stakes smaller. 

Suicide squad should be pulling a heist; stealing some Kryptonite, breaking one of Wallers assets out of prison, or maybe just holding up a bank as a distraction while the real heist happens elsewhere.  Something in the realm of mortal tasks. Not saving the planet, or even the city, from destruction at the hands of some ancient demigod. There's a whole group for that (*So that's it, huh? We some kind of Justice ~~Squad~~ League?*)

You can still have an action scene or two, sure. But the main draw should be the characters and their interactions. Kinda like a Soderbergh flick (Oceans 11, Logan Lucky) where the heist is still fun, but we're mostly here for the characters &&""guys guys guys... Let's try this shit 1 more time... I hear Disney just let a real talent go.""

How funny would it be if this sequel to a shit movie was what got DC back on track.&&So this is what it feels like to give a shit about Suicide Squad&&Disney really did shot themselves in the foot by firing gunn.

EDIT Thanks for the gold stranger, especially since it was an unintentional pun I made LOL. &&I mean, this may help make it better. The first one was awful IMHO. But his dark comedic background could make this good.&&The concept of Suicide Squad is incredible to begin with, but the execution in the first film was just not good.  James Gunn took a similar awesome concept an executed it perfectly.  Very excited for a DC film for the first time in awhile now.&&“And what do you think of Gunn’s previous online behavior?” 



Warner Bros: “Have you seen Justice League? Who the fuck cares about Tweets from 10 years ago?”&&Fuck... yes.

Now make it R Rated,,, and we will have a match made in heaven.

GotG shenanigans, but with villains with even more chaos and less desire to be good..  Yes.&&Oh wow, I thought this was fake. Glad Gunn is back on his feet.&&Friendship ended with Marvel. Now DC is my best friend. &&I hope he ends up directing the movie, and I hope SS 2 becomes the greatest DCCU movie to date. I want the execs at Disney to know how stupid they were for firing a director who brought them a 1.6 billion dollar franchise, and I say that as a huge MCU fan. &&How hilariously grand would it be if the entirety of GotG primary cast just transition into a Suicide Squad. (they wouldn't, but it'd be one hell of a riot). 

- Pratt  - Flagg
- Saldana  - Harley
- Bautista - Killer Croc
- Klementieff - Katana
- Sean Gunn - Captain Boomerang
- Diesel - Diablo
- Cooper - Deadshot&&What are we?  Some kind of Suicide Squad 2?&&It'd be hilarious if Gunn saved the DC universe. &&For a second I just read ""James Gunn"" and ""Suicide""&&Gunn: You sure? Even with my old and stupid tweets?

WB Exec: We don't give a shit if you've literally fucked children, save our goddamn franchise...&&As a DC fan, I hope this is the beginning of something great. &&#DaveBatista4KillerCroc

Edit: I called it. Kinda lol

After thinking about it, Bane would be perfect. 

https://twitter.com/DaveBautista/status/1049764974812430337&&The question will be if they leave him alone to make the movie he wants or not.

It will be a VERY interesting comparison. Since Gunn has made two great MCU movies and the first Guardians was so different from the existing MCU when it came out, Gunn's foray in DC movies will tell us if it is the Studio or simply bad stories and directors before.&&If DC was smart, they would hand over the reigns of the whole DCU to Gunn. Capitalize on Disney's huge mistake.&&Gunn could do a FANTASTIC job with the wacky and weird DC universe. &&Oh shit.  We might get a good Suicide Squad movie!&&God, Alan Horn, *you suck.*

But, good for Gunn. Can't wait to see it! (If this goes through).&&Yes thank you, with this dude as a writer the movie will be decent...... if they listen to him and don’t mess everything up&&[Bautista is in! ](https://i.imgur.com/tNe4Qud.png)

https://twitter.com/DaveBautista/status/1049764974812430337?s=19&&>It has been easy for studios to run from filmmakers caught up in this #MeToo moment, but Gunn was the decided exception.

This line rubs me the wrong way. Gunn was never caught up in #MeToo, he had a controversy concerning his numerous old jokes that were in poor taste, but there were never sexual harrasment allegations.

&&I hope it has Adam Warlock in it.&&I'll take shit I didn't see coming but glad its happening for 400 Alex.&&I never saw the movie, but it didn't seem like the cast was the major problem with the movie. I'm sure Gunn could get away with a so-called ""soft-reboot"" with the same cast where he just doesn't really acknowledge the events of the previous movie significantly with the same characters. &&I mean recasting margot and will Smith just isn't a financially good move imo. Can't see that happening, expecially with margot's birds of prey set to be released in a couple of years. &&I don't think they'll recast the same roles, but maybe swap out some old characters and swap a few new ones in, Suicide Squad makes perfect sense to do that with.&&can't believe I'm saying this but I hope they don't recast Jai Courtney. The material didn't do him any favors but maybe for the first time ever I saw some of that aussie charm in him, I would like to see him play that character with better material & good direction. It could be fun.&&I’m taking this less as being a complete reboot/disregarding the first and more taking some of the same established elements of the property but doing whatever he wants to do with them instead of building on the direction of the first one.&&Considering what a piece of shit SS was, I'll gladly take Gunns version of it.&&Top 10 anime betrayals&&DC basically tried to make GotG with Suicide Squad so this kinda makes all the sense in the world
&&Really? WB and other studios have definitely been looking at the success that Marvel has from the producers, actors, writers, directors etc 

It’s no surprise that they would jump at the opportunity to get James Gunn, regardless of him being fired. Both Guardians movies altogether made over 1.5b. They would be sure to get the Russo’s and Ryan Coogler if they could. 

Edit: Missed out altogether. &&I thought the only way something like this wouldn't happen is if Gunn decided he wasn't interested. I kind of suspect they'll have him in the Kevin Feige/Geoff Johns role if the DC films start to see some success. 

My wild guess is that DC, instead of the Marvel way of building the universe, will do what amount to a bunch of crazy Elseworlds movies, then they'll have a Crisis on Infinite Earths type even that unifies them into the main universe. Maybe not but it'd be a way to do a bunch of crazy visions, test out which ones resonate and work the best, and then bring them together into a universe in which people have some investment.&&Real talk, Bautista as Bane.
EDIT: Also, let's get Keanu Reeves as the Demon's Head.&&on that note, can yo imagine Dave Bautista in a thanos style mocap as Darkseid?&&For real though, he would make one hell of a Solomon Grundy.&&I read a while back that a lot of Marvel contracts specifically forbid working on DC film projects while under contract with Marvel. As amazing as Batista playing DarkSeid, or some other character, would be, Marvel Studios won't allow it. Now A4 comes out next year and if they get Guardians 3 finished, he may have fulfilled his deal with them, freeing him up for DC projects like Suicide Squad 2. Coming from the wrestling industry where non-compete clauses are common, I wonder if Disney writes in a stipulation such as that to prevent actor crossover after a contract term is fulfilled. &&I don't like what's happening with that 'd'.&&WB got a blue shell!&&You jest but

EDIT: Anna Kendrick is an equally good--if not better--choice &&Don't forget to include lots of tattoos and Latino street gangs&&Squirrel lives don't matter today &&if Ayer were to stick to more grounded story telling, I think he’d do very well.  End of Watch and Fury are some decent examples&&""So that's it, huh? We're some kind of Squirrel Girl Squad?""&&Almost like he has produced some of the best Marvel movies and Disney cutting him was the biggest mistake they could have made for Phase 4.&&Sources: WB executives beside themselves.

Not much excitement since that came to nothing. But this I'm on board with!&&Probably less actually. Disney basically gave him carte blanche.  Almost every single director credits gunn with this.

However, I'm not as confident as everyone else in Gunn's potential success outside of Guardians.&&Friendship with Marvel ended, DC is bestfriend now&&I imagine he doesn't like Disney but is still on good terms with Marvel &&“Then Chris Pratt joins cast of Suicide Squad 2” &&[We'll see about that.](https://twitter.com/DaveBautista/status/1049764974812430337?s=19)&&Or recovering meta humans for the government like in the comics. You’re right saving the world does seem a bit odd when you consider the team consists of a marksman, a psychotic clown, a samurai, a human crocodile and a guy who throws boomerangs... &&Now I'm stuck imagining Gunn taking Feige's place and helming a full DCCU reboot as a giant fuck you to Disney.&&I can see it as a headline once Suicide Squad 2 is critically acclaimed and makes bank at the box office:

Disney Fire Gunn, Shoot Themselves in the Foot.&&Everyone knows if you have a Gunn in the first act, you have to fire him by the third act.&&#ISeeWhatYouDidThere&&oh you clever bastard &&>Studio sources say the Gunn is not developing a “sequel” but a brand new  take on the DC property, which features DC villains Deadshot, Harley  Quinn, the Joker, Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc, who are forced into  the service of the government in exchange for lighter sentences

[THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-tackle-suicide-squad-sequel-warner-bros-1150661?utm_source=twitter&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral) is reporting that he is starting his own thing so who knows what it will come out to be.&&The film would've been better if they literally just copied the animated Suicide Squad movie to be honest. The second animated one was better too.&&I like GotG for most of the team basically being neutral good. They sometimes act in their own best interests (IE Rocket stealing everything, Quill talking about stealing the ship of whoever sent the distress signal in IW), but they aren't afraid to step up and save the *galaxy* when it's needed.

I'd be all over a Suicide Squad that was more of a neutral version of the GotG.&&I wasn't worried about Gunn not getting work. The reasoning for his firing was questionable at best, given that it was over jokes made well before his hiring at Disney. WB don't give a shit, plus they hate Alan Horn for ""un-retiring"" and would love to do anything to get back at him.&&Before he was officiallyout of his contract there were reports of people sitting and waiting until he was officially free.

Still it's good all that talked turned into something.&&Saldana could nail Poison Ivy.&&*Looks into camera*&&[deleted]&&Oh my God, the way Dave Bautista is shitting on Disney is a sight to behold.&&Batman is fine with Matt Reeves, no need for Gunn on everything &&No, you don’t have directors oversee the entire cinematic universe. Look what happened last time they did that. I like Gunn too but what has he done to show he can oversee an entire universe and not just a group of characters?&&Woah woah woah, slooooow down. I like James Gunn but 1) He's produced some shite movies, 2) Handing over the entire franchise to a director who has very distinct sensibilities did not work out well with Zack Snyder. It doesn't matter whether you like one and dislike the other. 

3) This already sounds a lot like the Joss Whedon situation. Joss made a huge hit for Marvel, he made an inferior sequel, and then he was fired from the 3rd installment, and then went to DC and tried to ""fix"" one of their movies, and it backfired.&&What annoys me about Alan Horn is that he is going to retire soon anyway, so whatever happens to GOTG 3 after he leaves, I highly doubt he gives a shit. It’s quite sad. &&>  if they ... don’t mess everything up

Shit you could say that about anything. 

Here's to hoping though, helps nobody to have more crappy movies out.&&Not one parent, child, coworker, or friend has accused him of any wrongdoing.  &&[deleted]&&Part of the fun of the Suicide comic is the rotating cast.  This allows characters to be killed of, and the ability to play with new dynamics.  At least a few of the characters should be replaced with new villains.  &&You'd be correct. The cast wasn't the big problem with that movie. No one in particular was *bad*. The movie was just a giant, messy shit show.&&Nah...if they re-cast the super hot Harley Quinn, they will lose some fans out of the gate&&Im guessing it will still have those 2 in it but i can see them not using most of the other characters in this one.&&We’re literally getting two different Jokers... at this point, anything is possible because WB is literally deciding what to do with the DCEU by plugging ideas in a random list generator.

Not that I mind it... &&Will Smith is expensive as hell though. He wasn't anything special in that movie either.&&I mean Robbie's Harley Quinn was the only thing that really stuck with the general public.&&I’m sure tons of people will disagree but I think Will Smiths performance was pretty weak in that movie to the point it contributed to how weak the overall film was. I mean you can’t have the team leader give a bad performance. Whether that had to do with how much he believed in the film I’m not sure, but I think Deadshot could be recast. 

Margot however should stay, especially with her birds of prey movie coming out. Besides, she was the best performance in the whole movie. &&Get rid of Smith. Keep Margot. Smith was not Deadshot. He was Smith cosplaying as Deadshot. Failed to nail the character on almost all fronts.&&I see them recasting Will Smith and then maybe Deadshot can use his fucking mask instead of just being Will Smith&&I think there’s a few that you could replace. Killer Croc could be swapped with Clayface if you still wanted that monster factor on the team. Replace fire guy with Killer Frost. Keep Deadshot, Boomerang, and Harley, possibly Katana.  I would say add Metallo as well since I don’t see a Superman sequel happening anytime soon. &&They just need to use him well. I mean he's set up to be one of the best thieves and infiltrators in the world and they literally let him throw one boomerang and his job is done. Also, have him bump heads with Deadshot since they are both cocky deadeye types.&&If they bring him back, they need to have Captain Boomerang actually show why using boomerangs is useful. They could have done really cool stuff, fittingly like Yondu in GOTG. Instead, they did nothing. 

Not getting killed by the Flash is not an achievement. Flash killed one guy in the comics and it turned into a multi-year trial. He doesn't kill people.&&That movie had many, many serious problems.

Jai Courtney wasn't one of them.&&his character was kinda fun honestly, would not mind him coming back at all &&After all those years, the guy's best performance is still Spartacus. &&Friendship with Marvel ended. Now DC is my best friend.&&All according to keikaku&&revenges*

and serves them right. Gunn's SS will be the first WB DC movies that I'll watch at the cinema since TDKR and GotG3 the first Marvel movie I will wait to pirate since Thor. &&Disney betrayed him first. This is more top 10 anime revenge...ses. Revengence. Revenging. &&Yeah, Disney did him dirty. &&Marvel betrayed him first&&Box office wise they succeeded big time. &&""Fine, I'll do it myself""&&Like they tried to make Avengers with Justice League, to the point of getting the director of Avengers? &&Coogler actually has a producing deal with WB, he did before Black panther &&Not at all surprised that DC would snatch up Gunn.

*Totally* surprised that they would give him Suicide Squad instead of keeping David Ayer around, considering how long they stuck by Snyder.

A pleasant surprise, to be sure. People complain about Snyder buy Ayer's Suicide Squad shit the bed worse than any of Snyder's movies, as far as I'm concerned (although Justice League came close).&&If Gunn is somehow able to revive DC Films and make it competitive vs Marvel in the coming years it would be some sweet karma. I could definitely see him in the Feige role for DC/WB&&I would watch every movie in that series. that is genius!  


which is why I am almost certain that DC won't take this route. &&>Bautista as Bane.

Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of Zack Snyder and David Ayer. ""I'll let you interpret that however you want,"" Gunn said.

And it was back in MARCH!?!

...I have a movie to go watch. &&I firmly believe DC should do this with all characters going forward. Just pick a beloved animated movie, and copy it exactly word for word.

If they could create great stories from scratch, I wouldn't feel this way, but so far I have not been impressed&&Deadpool has proved twice though that R-rated super/anti-hero movies can work and make bank well. Logan as well. I'm not saying all super hero movies need an R-rating, but Suicide Squad is one I feel that could fit in that Deadpool/Logan area. &&yeah but too bad Poison Ivy’s fictional :(&&They don't mean have him direct everything. They mean have him oversee projects like Feige.&&Fiege had already tapped him to do just that over all of the Cosmic Marvel characters/ movies in the MCU before he was fired.&&I don’t recall him being fired from Avengers 3. I thought he opted not to do it.&&Whedon was sort of rushed in after Snyder had to leave and the movie was already in production.

&&He'll retire, then comeback to take over Paramount.&&> coworker

In this case, quite the opposite. They came out in support.&&There was a lot of negative reaction to The Joker before the movie came out, but in the end it paled in comparison to the rest of the films issues - namely the editing.&&IMO Cara Delevingne as the Enchantress was a far worse travesty than Leto's Joker in SS.  At the end when she looked like she had a permanent case of epilepsy totally killed it for me.  

Honestly, I wish we would've gotten a full Joker movie with Leto.  Sometimes you just want to watch a trainwreck happen.  &&It also didn't help at all that the scenario they got sent in to deal with was not really a situation where the government needed deniability. They could have sent in normal heroes to deal with that. Or normal agents. The Suicide Squad is supposed to go on missions with low chance of survival and where their handlers can deny any knowledge of their existence. That is not the kind of situation the movie was about.&&> and people hated the Joker 

almost like plastering the character all over your trailers despite them having roughly 15 minutes of screen time is a dumb move. &&Also they don’t save the world in the comics, they do covert ops missions for the Government! Much more on their power level &&I bet any weaker links or actors that can't schedule into another one will be booted yeah. &&I mean the Squad itself is completely interchangeable so that makes sense. &&Now it will have Dave Bautista as Bane, Chris Pratt as Cat-Man, Zoe Saldana as Plastique, Vin Diesel as the voice of King Shark and Bradley Cooper as Copperhead.&&[deleted]&&They can throw Cpt. Boomerang in the mix and I'm cool with that.&&I kinda wish they’d bring back Killer Croc and do him justice.&&He was just will smith. I don't understand the praise lol he didn't act any differently than a hardened older will smith from the fresh prince of bel air. Robbie actually changed her persona for HQ. &&Robbie's Harley Quinn costume is what really stuck with the general public&&And the producers noticed, theyve got like 4 spin offs featuring her planned&&He also just demands to much screen time and focus. The budget would be better suited elsewhere.&&Will Smith is capable of acting, but mostly just chooses to be Will Smith in movies. It’s just like Bruce Willis. People like them, but they really don’t bring much to a role.&&Yeah I still don't understand that choice at all. 

I feel like after production had wrapped up, Will Smith at some point was reading about the movie and raised his eyebrows when he realized that his was supposed to the starring role of the film.
&&*braces for downvotes*

Will Smith plays the same character (Will Smith) in almost every single movie and I rarely find it satisfying to watch. I'd much prefer it if they recast Deadshot.&&It's just a stuntman in the mask all the way through, with Bane-voice distortion.

""No, trust me, I'm totally Will Smith under here...""&&And that's disappointing, since the DCEU could really have used another superman film before they went into the justice league and stuff imo. &&They did show a use for boomerangs!!

&&He’s less physical because he thinks it’s beneath him, but when he wants to make a point he’s terrifyingly powerful.

The suspense and thrill that scene portrays does a fantastic job of setting the tone for the film.&&I think he bears a striking resemblance to Etrigan (as I suppose most slightly squat, bald, muscle-bound men would), which would be an interesting anti-hero for a suicide squad to be sent after.&&Dave went on TV and literally said he may never work for marvel again.

&#x200B;&&Disney basically let him do whatever he wanted without any interference, allowing him to create the cosmic side of the MCU the way he did. Under DC/WB, he probably will not have complete freedom as they have been known to meddle with a director's creative vision. But who knows, maybe they will give him complete control and stay completely hands-off. It's too early to tell at this point.&&it means they gave him the freedom to do what he wants with the movie&&It means he had pretty much 100% freedom to do what he wanted.&&between this and the Shazam trailer, DC is looking better than ever.

Not because DC made a particularly smart decision, but because for once their impulsive, bandwagon-hopping decision ended up being the right one.&&> As long as they let him play

Could easily see this not being the case&&> Honestly, I’d argue that Gunn is even MORE suited to Suicide Squad than Guardians of the Galaxy.

I completely agree, while GOTG still has some of his style, it's still really different than his other stuff. Super and Slither are super violent and dark, while also being funny. An R-Rated Suicide Squad movie by James Gunn would be insane.&&Jame's Gunn&&Well, maybe subtract a couple of folks&&Gunn is a writer/director, Feige is a producer. Two completely different skill sets, giving a creator control over the whole franchise is how WB ended up in such a bad spot. &&So did his family, including his brother and ex-wife Jenna Fischer.  &&The Joker they created was horrifically stylised, and as much as I didn't rate Let's performance, I can see why he might have felt the need to really lean into it. &&You mean giving some of the characters 3 intros in the first act wasn't a good idea?&&I really hated that part. I was hoping for a DC Villians version of a modern action film with some dark humor. This sounds like a dumb complaint but I was kind of expecting it to be a Gallows humor version of a Tom Clancy novel rather than a comic book movie.&&Exactly! I would love to see killer frost and KGBeast in it.&&[deleted]&&Damn, Bautista would be legit as Bane.  And not just on looks.  He's got the chops to make the character interesting too.  Good call on that one, even if it's a joke.&&I get you’re going with this, but I would legitimately pay good money to see that.&&I watch anything with King Shark in it. I'm so glad he is part of The Flash.&&Or Thor:Ragnarok it and just kill them in 10 seconds.&&It would he good to see him get more screen time and lines if he did, he seemed like a great character that wasn’t used to his potential.&&Just wondering, what would doing him justice involve?  I'm not too familiar with the character; I know he started as something of a prototype Bane, but the main versions that I know about are Batman: The Animated Series (mainly [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEdg4glpCkg)) and the Batman Arkham games (where his entire characterization, start to finish, consists of ""GRARRGH!  I WILL EAT YOU, BATMAN!"").&&Also his version of deadshot was kinda a bitch. 

Still think he should've shot Harley in a non vital place I stead of fucking *MISSING*. Hes fucking Deadshot, he doesnt miss. &&I disagree she's been playing hot and crazy for a few years now.&&I know you're joking and all, but when was the last time Will Smith wasn't the star of a movie he was in? Genuinely asking. Even people like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have taken secondary roles I can remember.&&""One day, Price, you'll find that cuts both ways""&&(Secondary Translator's note: plan means cake)&&your username confirms this&&That, and Justice League was a terrible fucking movie.&&I think the real test will be whether or not they can attract the same kind of appeal in a second movie minus the allure of not only Joker, but Harley Quinn. 

Growing up watching Batman: The Animated Series, I was a HUGE fan of the Rogues Gallery, but Harley always held a special place in my heart. It's been utterly astonishing watching this obscure cartoon character achieve the pop culture status she has, not to mention as a *stand alone* figure in the DC Comics pantheon of iconic figures. 

Which is why I sincerely hope Birds of Prey does well, because SS and Quinn herself deserved so, so , so much fucking better.  Edgar Wright was my original pick for this kind of movie, an Ocean's Eleven type action/comedy of a bunch of misfits doing cool, absurdist, shit. The pick of Gunn is exactly the kind of attitude the first film should have had. 

It will be interesting to see how this turns out, and whether or not it will have the same interest for sure. &&There are fundamental flaws with Ayer's script which doomed the movie long before there was any studio interference.

The stakes were way too high. These characters should not have been tasked with saving the world or acting as a replacement for Superman. It should have been a much more grounded move like Deadpool.&&The movie was doomed since the begining because Flash could have ended the villain in no time, and he was part of the movie, so using the squad was not necessary, should have been some kind of mission in Arkham or something.&&Wow there are some great stories in this

>With Gremlins, Warner Bros. thought the film focused too much on the gremlins and wanted most of their scenes cut. Producer Steven Spielberg, in a move reminiscent of Back to the Future's response to meddling, suggested that the studio could cut every gremlin scene and call the movie People. The studio wisely backed down.&&>Alan Moore, because of this trope, not only refuses direct involvement with film adaptations of his comics, but also voluntarily relinquishes all profit rights to them. He also asks to have his name removed from adaptations' credits, which the studios only really started doing with Watchmen. Watchmen had a Troubled Production with two versions by different studios. The earlier Fox version saw a lot of changes. The setting was updated to take place during the War on Terror, it went from a character study to a straight action flick, and the plot was changed to Ozymandias going back in time to kill Dr. Manhattan, which somehow transported the characters into the ""real world"", where they're known as comic book characters. 

That sounds horrible.&&For you.&&He should be every single character except Bruce Wayne

And Hush will be played by Mason Ryan&&Norbat &&Of course!&&John Cena is just Guy minus a green leather jacket. &&It'd be great to see Darkseid throw down for a moment and just lay down on everyone even without the Omega Beams. Kind of like Thanos thrashing Hulk without any of the Infinity Stones just to have some fun and show everyone who runs this show. 

We all know he'd be obliterated by Supes eventually or outplayed by Bats, but it'd be a good show of power for Darkseid just to say ""I don't need to try and I'll still whoop yo' asses"". &&Well said. There's few actors that I get legitimately hype for when they're attached to a project, but he's definitely one of them.&&Sappers story was one I was disappointed we didn't get more of. I saw clips of more scenes that were taken out of the theatrical cut that would've shown more depth to his character but alas, the history of blade runner being too long plagues anyone who creates from it, I suppose. &&Bautista is on record as saying he doesn't want to be typecast by his body type, and that role, short as it was, proved he has the skill to be more than just his body type.&&Dave was initially the only guardian against Gunn being fired before the rest came out.     
He came out pissed guns blazing in support as disney didnt want bautista initially.    
        
Basically went on a Twitter rampage without ever directly saying ""fuck disney"" he insulted several times though.   
   
     
Later said screw the contract with disney, he wont do guardians 3 without gunns script being used.   
    
Gunn risked alot hiring dave and dave returning the favor
&&Do you see him crouching while he's doing it? Because I am :p&&Milana Vayntrub is also playing Squirrel Girl in the animated series that just started with a movie.

Got it.&&milana vayntrub&&Boobs. The word you are looking for is boobs. &&She has that quirky girl next door vibe somehow.&&OK, yes the boobs help but she also has [super dark brown eyes](https://i.imgur.com/eif9Yxu.jpg) (*kinda* nsfw).  They are so dark it almost appears her pupils are completely dilated. Men notice dilated pupils instinctively because it is an unconscious signal from a woman that a she is [sexually attracted](http://www.bodylanguageexpert.co.uk/what-do-dilated-pupils-mean.html) to you.  So when she looks at the camera it seems she's looking right at you and she wants it thanks to your male hormone driven brain....   And the boobs.  Definitely the boobs too.&&Plus she is genuinely hilarious. Her appearances on @midnight were some of my favorite.

Which doesn't mean it's not true....&&I think Mel would be a great fit. The man can demonstrably make a great movie, and has mastered the depiction of violence and gravitas. I'd love to see Mel Gibson do a comic book movie that allows him to deep dive into the darker side of things. &&Suicide Squad 2: Passion of the Squad&&2 hours of no dialogue and intense fight scenes that segue into one another.
&&""Alright, so Jesus is going to Izuna drop the Joker""&&Whenever it happends, Mel Gibson's comeback will be something to be reckoned with.

I can't wait.&&Yeah Mel Gibson might be a crazy fuck but dude knows how to craft a great cinematic experience. I stand by the opinion that Apocalypto is a masterpiece and one of the more underrated movies of the last 15-20 years.&&The people were surprised about Mel Gibson, but did they forget he was famous for being crazy? He was Mad Max and loose cannon Martin Riggs, and the guy who played pranks on sets. &&They've loosened things up. James Wan has been given significant freedom with Aquaman. &&> Under DC/WB, he probably will not have complete freedom as they have been known to meddle with a director's creative vision.

I bet on it.

Studios like WB and Sony always ruin their movies from corporate interference. It's basically what they are known for now. Taking great ideas, and ruining it based on pushing sequels, and market data and stuff. &&IIRC Gunn said that he turned in his first script with what he thought they would want and they told him “No, we want you to make YOUR movie”&&Imo dc has always had better stories to tell but they just fucked up their cinematic universe&&I doubt they will at this point. The first film managed to be a financial success at PG-13, I doubt they’d feel ambitious enough to change that even with Gunn’s involvement. &&DC’s cinematic universe plan up to now has been weak, designed-by-committee, market-tested “safe” movies, many of them trying to steal some success by aping similar, higher-quality Marvel movies. They just don’t seem to understand what people like about Marvel movies, which is that they’re not haphazardly thrown together into a loose, fragmented, awkward “cinematic universe.”

I too would pay good money for that.&&[deleted]&&did the girl companion that guest starred on Shield get killed also? I remember the bearded dwarf looking guy dying&&That sums up a lot of Suicide Squad tbh&&Also having him use a successful boomerang at least once would be fucking nice.&&Croc is very much a tragic character, an ordinary man born with a deformity and fallen prey to the torment he experienced growing up. His ""madness"" is him just playing that ""Killer Croc"" role that he believes is the only place for him.

He is constantly looking for those who will accept him for who he is, which is why he so regularly leans into the other Batman villains. But when he's treated like a normal guy by the heroes? He does exactly the same back, especially with the younger heroes. For example, he was one of the few voices that spoke to Roy Harper when he started drinking again, and kept him on the program.

Croc is a misunderstood character who is often reduced to a snarling monster.&&Best part of that clip is that it's not even Croc it's Batman in disguise. &&The skater girl movie certainly fit that bill.&&The Wolf of Wall Street was basically her audition reel for Harley Quinn. Even got the same accent and everything. &&apparently he is gonna be the genie in the Guy Ritchie live action Aladdin movie. So when that comes out.&&The joke I'm making is that his performance, and the material written for him, would not give the impression that he's the main character of the story.&&(Third Translator's note: they were changed from middle school age to  high school age in translation to avoid legal issues)&&plus the whole point of the Suicude Squad is to be the black ops team you send on shady missions and deny any US involvement.

which is totally undercut by the fact that you send them in with 50 army rangers as an escort. If you can send in the army, don't send in 50 rangers and the suicide squad, just send in like 5000 more rangers.&&Should've been a heist movie where the item they steal turns out to be a Mother Box. That way the movie would serve as buildup for *Justice League*, and it would've given the impression that there was some actual forethought put in to the DCEU.&&Superman could, flash can't run in a straight line in the DCEU right now. He's not great at his powers yet. &&don't understand why they didn't go the whole, ""joker has taken over Arkham, use his girlfriend against him with this squad of villains cause we don't care if they die and also they my have been in arkham before""

Operations in the middle East or something. Based on their skillset they are not in the ""save the world"" league and it didn't feel organic at all. Like, what's Harley Quinn's power? Being fucking psycho and hitting people with a baseball bat? Or the Croc, who big, has thick skin and is pretty strong (but, like, strongest bodybuilder in the world strong, not superhuman strong).  Taking down some dictator would make a lot more sense and been more in line with their characters. &&No one cared who I was until I put on the mask. They couldn't even see me unless I moved.&&But they still won’t be able to figure out who Batman is. &&DCEU as a one-man show?

There’s a big difference between that and ranting about Jews.&&The Joaquin Phoenix joker movie definitely looks pretty hands-off.&&True, but the dismal quality of Suicide Squad is a meme at this point. They had the benefit of nobody knowing quite what a turd it was when it first came out.

It might make more sense for them to pivot, so they have something to demonstrate that this is a departure from the first film.&&>That would mean we’d have 3 live action Jokers at the same time.

Those kinds of shenanigans would never happen in the comics.&&Three Jokers wouldnt be comic inaccurate tbh.&&What was it like seeing Fiege at work? He seems pretty casual for one of the most influential people in Hollywood. &&You should do an AMA! There's all kinds of fascinating insights you have by having worked on both Marvel and DC films.&&I thought the joker looked and acted like a Clown/Pimp/Gangster, or CPG for short. I just didn’t like it from his chrome teeth, to the super car, and that teardrop tattoo. None of his look made him intimidating, instead I thought he was going to drop a mix tape halfway into the movie.&&Yeah, I actually really liked the direction Leto was going with The Joker in this movie. He was a new kind of insane that we haven't exactly seen before (as far as I know, I'm not crazy well versed). However, it was so woefully incomplete and those tattoos really did distract anybody who is a fan of Joker. 

Leto complained that they cut a ***lot*** of his performance. I do wonder how good it could have been, ignoring the tattoos, if they hadn't hatcheted up his roll. Or, maybe it was worse and that's why it was cut.

But yeah, a big part of me wants to see Leto get a shot with a better and properly supported production team around him. It might be terrifically different.&&Was he really, though.....that's like saying Jaques the Jumper was in Captain Ameruca Civil war.....&&He died a crispy death though. But continuity is about to be seriously shifted for DC so I don't think it matters.&&I wouldn't mind a Will Smith replacement. I felt like he was just being Will Smith and not a unique character. &&>Jared Leto

Only if he’s instructed to actually play The Joker instead of a generic white-wannabe-gangsta in Joker cosplay.&&Even Leto? I haven't seen the movie and I love the actor, but his joker got absolutely crushed by critics and fans alike.&&I like how we just believe it now. Batista as Bane confirmed.&&No, Sif lived (i believe because the actress was busy filming something else at the time so wasnt able to be in the movie). The warriors 3 (Fandral, Hogan, Volstaag) were killed. &&Lady Siv was not in thor 3, she's probably still alive to be used later but her situation is unclear as far as where she is.&&I demand more Slipknot&&The whole Roy Harper part was a huge eye opener for me into how layered Killer Croc's misunderstood and complicated character could be. The part that got me the most was when he pulled Roy aside and said ""GRARRGH! I WILL EAT YOU, BATMAN!""&&I feel like they tried to establish that in the movie. They had him caged him up in a sewer and tossed him raw meet etc. I think there were also actual lines about how he was treated like a monster by society so he became one during the introduction of his character.

But personally, I feel like Killer Croc should have been like the size of the Mountain in GoT and a little less human faced, just more frightening but that's just my opinion. He always scared me as a kid because of his sheer size and strength but the version in Suicide Squad wasn't as intimidating because he was mostly just a guy with crocodile skin and sharp teeth.&&He eats people. 

&&By “do him justice” I mean have him actually do something in the movie other than take a bath.&&Damn... Coulda had Shaq&&Superman can’t empathize with the common man, Batman can’t not kill people, Wonder Woman can’t stop being he only good movie, Cyborg can’t get any screen time, and Aquaman can’t be trying harder to convince people he’s cool again.&&> What they really should have used the squad for is some plausible deniability, dark tactics shit.

That's pretty much what they do in the comics. Sending them against a world-ending threat makes no kind of sense whatsoever. Ugh that movie was so frustrating because it could so easily have been so much better...&&No one cared how fast my reflexes were until I caught them&&It would be a great movie if Bautista played all the villains and Batman and they mused to themselves that they have no way of knowing who Batman could be.&&He’s done so in the past though, it’s basically up to whoever is writing him at the time. It’s one of the reasons he wants Supergirl as a fury, so that he has a Kryptonian that can rival if not outright beat Superman. He can beat Supes but it isn’t an easy fight for him and he doesn’t like doing his own dirty work.&&Its a disney contract.

How's that going to work&&People who don't look at movie forums online (ie most people) aren't aware that Suicide Squad is widely disliked. I know many people who literally never know how a film is received critically, and many people who thought Suicide Squad was good. These people don't even understand ""DC vs Marvel"", its all just superheros to them. &&He's not causal at all. He's actually pretty intense. He was always very cool with me, but as an executive he knows how to make you feel like he's the most important person in the room, without saying it or projecting it.
  
I was more impressed with his knowledge of comic books. Most executives are corporate lawyer types who generally know how films are made, but don't really care to know the details. He knows everything about Marvel comics. &&A lot of those insights are probably shielded by an NDA though

Those guys don't fuck around with trade secrets and whatnot&&> None of his look made him intimidating

B- but he had 'damaged' tattooed on his forehead, clearly he's a madman.&&Lil'Jokester &&He was definitely a clown pimp gangster. Couldn't take him seriously at all.&&Tbf if he dropped a mixtape halfway through the movie's plot that'd actually be amazing

I'm all aboard Soundcloud Joker&&Well to be fair, I dont think they're chrome teeth. It's been stated that Batman punched out his actual teeth and he has ones that seem to be made of metal&&I heard that the Joker was originally supposed to save Harley in the chopper only to kick her out mid-flight. Then Harley gets all mopey cuz Mr. J tried to kill her, but at the end of the movie, she runs right back into his arms because they’re both fucking nuts.

I really wish we got to see that version. It may have actually made Suicide Squad somewhat interesting.&&If it was anything like his BR2049 performance then it would have been great. &&Do not take our Lord, Batroc the Leaper's name in vain&&Batroc at least had part of his costume&&I mean he was explicitly referred to as Anatoli Knyazev, was an adversary to Batman, and played a fairly important role throughout the film. &&I'm assuming you're meaning Batroc in Winter Soldier? Even though his part was small at the beginning of the movie, I'm glad they used him like that. You're not going to see him headline a movie, so only other option would be on Agents of Shield or the Netflix shows. 

What we saw of KGBeast was 100% forgettable, and had no role.&&Honestly? I liked him. I love watching different takes on the Joker because they can be so wildly different. He was fun, and I bought him as an unhinged crime lord. They clearly wanted to go for urban gangster, and you know what? I think it worked. 

I liked the character, but a lot of people took issue with Leto himself and his behaviour on set. He tried method acting, and just acted like a dickhead. If he spent more time trying to act and less trying (and utterly failing) to take a page out of Ledger's book, I think he could play a special take on the Joker.&&I want this so bad it hurts&&Lucky her, the rest of the original cast didn't do too well&&She's going to be joining Valkyrie and Jane Foster as Thor's triumvirate of wives when he rebuilds Asgaard on Earth.&&He can climb anything&&He climbed right into all of our hearts&&*I've felt the hate rise up in me*

The reason the dynamic works is because he is an enemy Supes can not beat into submission. He only ever beats up his avatars since in reality he is a metaphysical force of reality. 

I get it though, movie wise a writer could do anything. Just wished they made Darkseid a little OP by default to differentiate him from Thanos, who is scrappy and likes to punch things.   &&I would love for him to just be invisible in every scene just standing randomly in the background of different scenes&&Does he have lots of fuck you money?

Why don't we just call him.&&Hardcore Henry was so much fun.&&I think we’re all trying to pretend he doesn’t exist&&No, it's considered a stand-alone movie.

The different series exist in the same multiverse (but not on the same earth, supergirl is on earth 38 and flash/arrow on earth 1), now we're going to have different earths for movies as well (and for now, not linked whatsoever, not in the same multiverse or anything) and maybe down the line they'll just all be part of the same multiverse, who knows ?            
          
In other words, they're applying the same rules as with comic books : just write about whatever hero you want, be it an entire new take or a continuity.&&I feel like if they had made it look like he did the tattoos himself, or replaced it with scarification it could have actually been pretty cool, but instead it just looks like he went to a tattoo parlor.

I needed this news today. Thank you. &&According to [Netflix’s tweet](https://twitter.com/netflixfilm/status/1054379347535118336?s=21) about it, it’s a stop motion musical. Co-directed by Mark Gustafson (animation director for *Fantastic Mr. Fox*) and co-written by Patrick McHale (*Over the Garden Wall*).

Edit: GDT has also noted that he is especially inspired by Gris Grimly’s Pinocchio illustrations, which are [super cool](https://www.google.com/search?q=gris+grimly+pinocchio&safe=off&client=safari&channel=iphone_bm&prmd=isvn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihg-ThxZreAhUQHjQIHcBID_cQ_AUIESgB&biw=375&bih=553) if you’re not familiar with him.&&Until I see a trailer, I’m not gonna hold my breath.

On the other hand, I hate that they're still unwilling to offer a proper theatrical run for their major films.

At least, it looks like Roma will get a bigger run than any of their previous films.&&I was hoping he'd be able to do justice to the bizarre story of the original book, unlike so many adaptations have been able to, but I strongly think a musical is the wrong way to go for that.&&Netflix making directors wild dreams come true, love it. &&Glad to see Patrick McHale getting more work in the public eye. Over The Garden Wall was an instant classic that any fan of animation should see.&&For some reason I misread that as Quentin Tarantino and had to do a double take.&&I was lucky enough to see the puppets for this already at mckinnon and Saunders earlier this year.
The puppets are very well made and delicate lots of magnetic replacement parts.

Was going to say I can't share any photos but just seen the exact puppets and some design images and better photos are available on Google image searches

They were both on Silent Hills before that collapsed I believe. 

Hey HBO and Netflix execs: An anthology series of del Toro adaptations of Junji Ito’s short horror stories is exactly the kind of thing the people want.  

If there’s one person I trust to adapt, say, Long Dream to the screen, it’s Guillermo del Toro. &&I highly suggest people read the original story written by Carlo Collodi. It started as a newspaper serial and ended with Pinocchio being hung but people liked it enough that it was then continued and published as a children's novel. It was basically a dark comedy. One of the funniest yet also touching stories I've ever read and no movie has done it justice because all people know of it now is Disney's version which isn't bad but just not as good as the original. I hope Guillermo makes something really true to the original.&&He's gonna make the donkey scene scary as *fuck*&&Wasn't this rumored to happen around the same time Pacific Rim came out?

Del Toro's Netflix/Dreamworks show, *Troll Hunters* is based off a book he co-wrote.

Oh yes, this should be weird in *all* the right ways!&&I read the title and thought ""That should be interesting. his really good at making good bizarre movies.'


Then I read your comment and thought 'Holy shit. I need this movie.' 

Edit: he's not his&&Even though Netflix is losing a lot of big name shows like Sunny and Futurama, their OC is fucking on point a lot of the time. Way better than any other studio imo right now. 

Not even a streaming service anymore, just a straight up studio making bangers over and over again.&&Musical....&&All I wish was Laika was behind the puppets, but I'll take these guys too :)&&Thats one hell of a pedigree.&&Nooo

Del toro needs to partner with Laika. &&Holy shit that’s a really interesting crew they put together! I’m stoked to see how this goes! Have they announced what studio will be doing the stop motion? Wonder if they’ll get star burns industries or Laika ..&&Because children were getting to normal lol. This will be awesome&&This gon be spoopy&&I trust Del Toro will make Mangiafuoco absolutely terrifying. &&Oh shit, I'm hyped.&&/u/Merekisgreat&&Robert Downey Jr will be very bummed. He REALLY wants to make a Pinocchio franchise. &&Well now there are several flavors I like in that.  This could be good.  &&>>Guy Davis will serve as co-production designer and the film’s puppets will be built by Mackinnon and Saunders, the team behind “Corpse Bride.”

Fuck yeah, Guy Davis. You should all check out the comic The Marquis: Inferno, he makes such cool monsters.
&&God Damn someone said ""how many dark film people can we fit in on this production"".&&That's such a strong team, I wish it had been attributed to a new property than another rehash of a story we've been told before&&No matter what this ends up being like, this lineup of creators is an undeniably talented bunch. I’m excited!&&Holy shit this thing has everyone working on it.&&Over the Garden Wall was amazing. This is going to be really good.&&Okay the Patrick McHale addition officially has me excited. Now that you mention it, I have yet to rewatch Over the Garden Wall this October, and it’s become one of my favorite autumn things. Time to throw that on the tv...&&Ain’t that just the way.&&I'm begging you to stop. I'm in physical pain from how absurdly good this collaboration is.&&Shit's going to get super weird, super quick.&&[deleted]&&If he ever actually proceeds with an R rated At The Mountains of Madness I will shoot my sweet hot goo all over the place&&I don't think we'll have to worry about this one. It's Guillermo's dream project, and Netflix already agreed to fund it. It's happening. &&yeah but this says production is starting this fall...and it is currently fall so presumably very soon. usually Del Toro projects are announced in the script stage where there's plenty of time for them to not get greenlit for production.

Del Toro has never failed to deliver a movie once principal photography has started.&&There is three different Pinocchio movies right now. The RDJ one, PTA left and is now supposedly being directed by Ron Howard. There is also a live action Disney one in the works.&&Yeah, I came here looking to see if this project shared any DNA with that. Knowing that isn’t happening isn’t anywhere near as disappointing as the Aaronofsky Robocop that never came to be. &&I'm holding out for Haunted Mansion too. Come on Disney, make it happen.&&I’m still waiting on Monster. The manga turned anime. One of the greatest television shows of all time, and they were gonna put a live action version on HBO.

I really think they should still make it, even without Del Toro. It would be crazy if they actually kept it in the same timeline, filmed it in Germany and the Czech Republic etc.

Again, what a show it was.&&Have you seen Haunting of Hill House? That shit is creepy af and all based around a haunted mansion. 

Nothing Disney about it though, but if you want a great scary show about a haunted house you can't go wrong.&&I would wipe Hellboy from my mind if I could get Mountains of Madness. &&>creator of Bojack

They also created Robot Chicken, Moral Orel (if you want to watch another show like Bojack, I recommend it) and Mary Shelley's Frankenhole.&&What is this a crossover episode?&&Don't forget Patrick McHale, the guy behind Over the Garden Wall&&Also Patrick McHale writing, he wrote Over the Garden Wall!&&And it's by the same stop motion animators as Fantastic Mr. Fox which is an absolutely beautiful film &&This. I mean, I'm in for whatever del Toro wants to do, but damn, I want At the Mountains of Madness really bad.&&As much as I want that, too, I think another studio owns the IP. If I remember correctly, he was working on it a while back and it got scrapped. I'm guessing whoever was doing it before still has the rights for it.&&There was a rough draft of the script and it was terrible. Here read it for yourselves.

NSFW but i imagine it’ll be something like this. &&I think that hinges on how terrifying you find puppets to be in the first place. I was a lot more nervous when I thought it was going to be live action...&&As long as he gets Jonatan Taylor Thomas to play Pinocchio again!&&I was hoping someone would make note of that. *Over the Garden Wall* is a fantastic miniseries that deserves a lot more recognition. Beautiful stuff. The fact that he's involved with this, especially on the screenplay, is pretty exciting to me.&&""SAY JIMINEY CRICKET ONE MORE TIME""&&iirc, there was an article about how del toro was planning to have tom waits and christopher walken in the cast. &&What do you mean by directing, roughly speaking?&&I think Del Toro said a while back that he wanted to make a Anti Fascist Pinocchio movie lol.&&Also the original original version ends with Pinocchio being robbed by bandits who hang him from a tree, which takes longer than normal to kill him because he's a puppet.

When the story was picked up by a publisher who wanted more content, that was changed so that being a puppet made him immune to hanging and the bandits got bored of waiting for him to die and left. &&Just as long as nobody has sex with Pinocchio.&&Aren't all classic childrens tales disturbing in their original form?

Hunchback of Notre Dame?

Little Mermaid?

Cinderlla?

Hercules?

Peter Pan?&&The Disney version was messed up.&&Aren't the original novels/stories of many Disney movies far much more disturbing? 

Can someone provide examples of stories that were far more disturbing in the original source material than the Disney movie? &&All fairytales are grim for today's standard

In the 1850s (let's say the era this kind of story has been popping in in full swing) Europe had the smallest child mortality rate of any other place in the world. Yet it still had a bit over a half of children not reaching adulthood - the very tender lives that children live in is a recent construct, in the past it was more savage, in the very early medieval ages it was less than one fifth that survived, the wealthiest region in the world in 1600 was the Netherlands and it had an estimated 1/25 the average wealth per capita than today's Netherlands. Then extrapolate for things like hygiene etc. Modern culture really does a crappy job of portraiting life in the past and schools don't really help.

 That meant that children from more than one hundred years ago were much more numb to the events portraited in a children book. I'm not a native english speaker, so I don't know the name but that tale of the poor girl going to a ballet and losing a glass shoe that then a prince finds ends with her eyeballs being eaten - I don't remember why but there was a lesson of morale, the focus was showing kids the lifelong consequences of bad morale, that'd teach kids because losing eyeballs is an irreversible mistake. All of course written in a text that uncomplex enough for a children to understand.

And before people pop out saying ""dude I'm pretty sure they were effective because it scarred children"", your average children would be accostumed to death, he probably saw other childrens his age die since his early years, was probably used to severe malnutrition specially of seasonal food (Most Vitamin C sources don't make crops during winter), bad infrastructure, diseases, lack of hygiene, war, etc. These stories wouldn't traumatize because that'd be just the reality for them, just the natural order of things, the expected reality, whatever you call, etc. They would be educated/acconditioned since the early days by observing real life that those texts wouldn't be out of their view of normal (except for the supernatural part of birds that break in in a castle andeat eye or a siren who becomes human)

Before someone misinterpret what I wrote I don't defend that we should introduce birds that eat eyes in kid story, simply because real life for modern kids is much different from the past

Just looking at all the other replies of the original comment above, one can read about, stories with dismemberment and death and grim things are common&&Yeah my wife and I bought a Pinocchio book for our kids as a souvenir when we went to Italy.

&#x200B;&&This is true but I didn't want to edit for a 3rd time... 

Over the Garden Wall was an animated masterpiece. &&This whole thread looks like a conspiracy to make me ejaculate from reading IMDb entries. &&I love stop-motion and can't wait to see Guillermo's take on it. &&Their horror selection for originals is a bit lacking but I just watch *Apostle* and goddamn!

I’ll say this: I was thinking about cancelling Netflix to save money and this is making me rethink that decision...&&Yum&&>It's Guillermo's dream project

...and King Kong was Jackson's... I have seen what happens when directors get their hands on their passion products and lots of money.. things don't work out.&&Didn't he drop the Hobbit fairly late in the process?

A 1-2 season run of Monster would be the ultimate banger on Netflix. It's a dark crime drama with a machiavellian psycho killer set in 80s Germany with connections to modern political issues.  It's like someone traveled back 20 years into the past to write the most protypical netflix show, before there was Netflix.

You can trim the fat a little and make it 15-20 episodes of just highlights.

My research was horrifying and would not help and child sleep today. &&Yes. When I was a child I somehow managed to acquire  Hans Christian Andersen ""original"" versions (They were adapted, but kept the idea of the originals). I loved reading them, but they scared the shit out of me. I remember one where some poor spoiled girl wore shoes when she shouldn't, so she was cursed to dance for the rest of her life. The dancing shoes wouldn't come off. So she asks this guy to chop off her feet in the end. But that wasn't enough, no. Her animated, amputated feet follow her around and keep harassing her. 

Pretty gruesome stuff.&&the whole donkey scene and him getting drunk?    It was weird to 5 year old me and is weird to me now&&Correction:  The Disney version was messed up *enough already*.

 Like the Little Mermaid originally ends with her wanting to go back to being a mermaid, and she gets the chance to: she just has to kill the prince. She can't bring herself to do that though, nor live as a human, so.. she kills herself. Then becomes some sort of air elemental spirit, or something.

Oh, and the other big plot point: Mermaids *don't have real souls* in the original story. There's some weird Christian overtones that may or may not have been added after the fact.&&Ah so the original lesson was ""behave or you will die a horrible death"".&&The Disney movie certainly does not portray his hijinks as harmless fun.

But then gets the chance to potentially live in heaven. &&""Now go to sleep! And stop asking me for shit!""&&Doesn't she become an indentured slave with her tenure increasing every time a kid cries?&&That's not all. 

The unnamed mermaid first meets the unnamed prince when his ship breaks apart during a thunderstorm, as per the film, but she makes a decision to let every other sailor on board die to find the prince, who she'd been stalking all night. 

After saving his life, she continues to stalk the prince, but when she tells her sisters about him her grandmother tells her she can't be with him because she doesn't have a soul and can't get one except through Christian marriage (which I'm sure gives little girls a GREAT message). 

So she visits the Sea Witch who gives her a potion that'll make her be human by taking a knife to her tail and carving it into legs, which hurt as if they're being carved anew every step she takes. Also, unlike the three days Disney Ursula gives her, the transformation is permanent but she still doesn't have a soul and now has a shorter lifespan. Also instead of paying with her voice being magically muted, she lets the witch cut out her tongue. Like with a knife. 

So the prince goes to visit the neighboring princess as in the movie, and discovers that she's the one who saved his life (apparently), and they're set to get married, but in the original story the mermaid's sisters visit the sea witch and are given the knife used to cut out the mermaid's tongue. They give it to her and tell her that she must stab the prince in the heart and it will break the spell and turn her back into a mortal, soulless mermaid, but she can't go through with it and turns back into sea foam. 

Her half-formed soul is then released into the air as a wind spirit, and as she flies away watching the prince and his new bride, she tells the children listening to the tale that she has to serve 300 years as a wind spirit, but every time she blows into a new home and finds a behaving child in it her sentence is reduced by one year and she'll get to go to heaven one year sooner. &&> Instead of losing her voice 

I assume having her tongue cut out with a knife had a similar impact on her ability to talk.  Honestly I think the Disney writers (at least slightly) improved on it by coming up with the whole ""lose your voice"" angle, since not only was it less grim, but also, presumably temporary hinging on the completion of the deal with the witch, and provided her an obstacle to contend with.&&The moral of most children's stories is really, ""Life's fucked up, now get back to work.""&&She's not named that in the original, I'm sure&&I don’t think I’ve ever read the words “sea foam” so many times in a short span of time before. Sea foam. &&Seriously the pink elephants and shit in dumbo is stuff of nightmares&&Pinocchio still terrifies me.&&In the original version of the fairy tale, she also feels like she's walking on knives and her feet bleed constantly.

He just wants a little friend and they get into mischief, like levitation and spilling pea soup on mom's nice clothes.

Eventually a couple of nice priests talk to the demon about civilized western social norms, sing some songs and the demon gets a nice little set of clothes and a spot in school and everyone learns a lesson about having too much fun. &&Some of us are just born to rock the bed. &&Was truly masterful&&It’s weird that Netflix is making their own actual movies, from a past perspective.

&&Disney used the public domain of stories to create new versions.  It wasn’t stealing.  That was extremely commonplace.  Where the problem lies is them then forcing laws to change to protect their stuff from entering the public domain and being used and now we have this clusterfuck of copyright issues. &&>Basically all of Disney's old films (only a mild exaggeration) are them stealing old stories


Not really stealing when a lot of these Fairy Tales never qualified under copyright law and the authors of them have been dead for centuries.

&&Also for a similarly horrific return to the past, find a reasonably accurate translation the *One Thousand and One Nights* (Arabian Nights).  The body count eclipses 1001 pretty damned fast, and many protagonists meet grizzly ends.&&I'm still waiting on a version of the King Arthur stories that include the time he murdered all the babies in the kingdom in case one of them was his.

You see - Arthur boned his sister (without knowing she was his sister), and Merlin told him he would be killed by his son by this union. So he figured out when the birthday would have been, and had all the lords in the kingdom send their sons with similar birthdays to him for ""protection"", on a boat. He sank the boat, and everyone died except Mordred, the one that he was trying to kill in the first place - and Mordred was raised by nearby fishermen until he grew up and he and Arthur killed each other.

Odd how the modern versions leave out such an important part of the origin story of the man who kills Arthur. &&You win joke of the day&&[removed]&&those were childrens tales, childrens tales for another, really fucked up, generation of children, but childrens tales afterall&&There was a TV series - [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(1998_TV_series) )&&Don't know if you're joking but in the myth Hercules comes back from a war and proceeds to violently massacre megara and their children in a fit of madness.

But that's just a rumor. &&And to be more specific, the witch literally cuts out her tongue (with a dagger/knife, right?) - none of that painless magic-y ""remove yo' voice"" stuff from the movie.&&Nah her sisters sacrifice their hair so the witch can give them a knife, which if the Little Mermaid uses to kill the Prince will allow her to become a mermaid again.  She can't do it and throws herself off the boat and turns into sea foam as expected, but the selflessness and her desire to be human is strong enough that her soul goes to heaven. Or she's given the chance to go to heaven. Something like that.  Either way at the expense of love and the despair of her sisters for their lost hair and now dead sister.&&Her obstacle in the story was getting an immortal soul and entry to heaven. Mermaids are soulless creatures who expire upon death while humans are not.

She thought the way to do it would be by pretending to be something she's not (a human being). The price of doing so if losing your voice and inflicting needless pain upon yourself.

Instead, after she dissolves into sea foam (what usually happens to dead mermaids), she does not cease to exist but is instead reborn as a ""daughter of the air"", a sort bright and weightless air spirit.

In her new form, God gave a chance to earn herself a soul through god deeds and helping humanity over the span of 300 years (the natural lifetime of a mermaid). After she has obtained a soul, ahe will be admitted to heaven.

This is why some critics think it was an allegory for Andersen's homosexuality or bisexuality.

Phoebus doesn't remember Esmeralda's name, and instead nicknames her ""Similar"" because he's had sex with so many similar-looking girls, but still convinces Esmeralda what they have is 'true love' and that they should have sex immediately.  Right before it happens, Frollo gets jealous and pulls a knife and stabs Phoebus.  Phoebus runs away.  Frollo has Esmeralda arrested for witchcraft and the murder of Phoebus.  At her public trial, Phoebus is present.  Esmeralda pleas for him to show he's still alive and clear it up, but he doesn't.  She hangs, and her body is thrown away as garbage to rot.

Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds to mankind for 300 years and will one day rise up into the Kingdom of God.&&Yes, it’s foam. When I was a kid we had a book that was a version of the original tale, not the disneyfied one, and there was an illustration of her turning to foam at the end.

&&Upvote for HWSNCH.&&r/dundermifflin&&I cannot get away from the office anywhere....&&I would say Disney’s take on the character is that he’s certainly selfish and impulsive but basically out of naïveté and blind curiosity rather than just being a nasty brat. You always feel like he’s a good, sensitive kid making poor choices so he’s definitely more sympathetic and more naturally prone to learning the right lessons along his journey.&&Italo Calvino put together a set of Italian fables, I believe based on a challenge that Italy had nothing like the brothers Grimm and their tales.

To my taste, the funniest one is the German one, mostly because in that one she's called Aschenputtel and that's the silliest-sounding version of the name that I've come across. &&Don't forget the part where the sisters are put into barrels with nails driven into them and rolled down a hill to their death. &&The orginal Snow White ends with the prince forcing the Queen to Dance in red hot iron slippers and dance until she dies. &&Not that it was a good movie, but when Disney did that ""Into the Woods"" movie, they kept the stepsisters part of the story in it.&&Disney did use the Charles Perrault version, which predated the Grimm version by about 100 years, and kept to it pretty faithfully.&&At least they can steal their own creative works and remake them!&&Wow, I've never even heard that before. &&I'll bite, why are both of you in every thread?&&Weirdest novelty account &&Bitch please, do you even german fairy tales?&&Gotta end it with \\)) to make it work right.

""A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the will of another hangs her eternal destiny.

TLDR:
She becomes foam, but then gets be air and a chance to go heaven if children behave, but if they are wicked she is fucked. &&This is what I remember except for the heaven part. My copy of the book said something about her losing her soul or something and feeling the pain as the sea foam dispersed?

Neither does killing herself.&&>doing good deeds to mankind for 300 years and will one day rise up into the Kingdom of God

Almost straight out of a Chick tract.&&You forgot the bit where she has to serve an additional day for every tear that a child sheds.&&> she is greeted by other daughters who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds to mankind for 300 years and will one day rise up into the Kingdom of God.

That... sounds like a punishment, not a reward. Humans go to heaven just by being good in life, why did she have to make a ""display of selflessness"" (also how is suicide selfless?) *and then* do 300 years of good deeds? None of it makes any sense, it almost seems like it's wrong or something.

Edit: it all makes sense now, apparently in the story mermaids don't go to heaven and are shown as lesser beings without souls.&&Wasn't *that* an addition because the original was too fucking dark?&&Mein thoughts ekzactly.&&Yeah so you should probably avoid stairs and large bodies of water. &&Wait until you get to Sleeping Beauty.

* She sleeps through the rape, pregnancy, and birth of twins

* While the babies are suckling on her, one of them knocks out the flax from her fingernail and she wakes up

* King comes back and brings her to court

* His wife is unhappy with this

* She orders the cook to cook the children for the King

* He pretends to, and serves some more-acceptable meat pies instead

* Queen orders Sleeping Beauty burned at the stake while the king is out of town

* King returns and has his queen burned alive instead. 

* Sleeping Beauty lives happily ever after with her rapist. &&Pretty sure Hansel and Gretel baked the witch.&&[deleted]&&What’s HWSNCH?&&The Disney version is called Assenpoester in Dutch, so to me it seems normal.

^^I'll ^^see ^^myself ^^out.&&The Bible is one of the rare books that have more Christian overtones at that point &&That summary is missing crucial details.

Her selflessness wasn't her pursuit of a human soul, but rather, her actions and decisions along the way. Her selflessness was that, in her human form, she devoted herself purely to making her beloved prince happy, despite the fact that the sea witch ensured that doing so caused her excruciating physical pain.

When the prince fell in love with another woman, she devoted herself to helping create a perfect and joyous wedding for him, despite the emotional pain that brought her - and despite knowing that his marriage to another guaranteed her own death.

She didn't commit suicide. The sea witch have her a deadline - if she failed to make the prince fall in love with her, then she would die and become sea foam. On the night that the prince married and that she was to die, she was given an alternative. She could kill the prince in his sleep, and return to life as a mermaid. She chose to die rather than harm him.

Jumping off the ship didn't kill her, it was simply her accepting her fate.&&That's why she's gotta do 300 years of community service.&&I'll note that the ending was added in after the fact and it initially just ended with her death.&&I want to know how she gave birth to twins?

There are so many other people who have poured their time into making that movie who deserve to see it through.&&For everyone saying Kevin Spacey is innocent, this is directly copied from his Wikipedia page:

""The Guardian was contacted by ""a number of people"" who worked at the Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years; they alleged that he ""groped and behaved in an inappropriate way with young men at the time"".[88][89] On November 16, the Old Vic confirmed that it had received 20 testimonies of alleged inappropriate behavior by Spacey, with three persons stating that they had contacted the police.[90] In December, Spacey's Usual Suspects co-star Gabriel Byrne revealed that production on that film was shut down for two days because Spacey made unwanted sexual advances toward a younger actor.[91"" 

In other words, a company is allowed to fire an employee who mistreats his co-workers. It's not much of an SJW/feminist/msm/court of public opinion lynching when put that way.

Polanski has been in hot waters for literally 40 years. For many people, that’s more than enough time to start forgiving him or at least moving on.

That’s also why Mel Gibson is popular again. Water under the bridge.

When it comes to cases like Spacey or James Gunn, the outrage is fresh. It doesn’t matter when the words were spoken or the crimes committed, it’s about how recently the general public has been made aware of them.

I can guarantee you that Spacey will be popular again at some point before his death. Just give it enough time. No one is radioactive forever (except Marie Curie)&&[deleted]&&Greeeeat movie. Other guy was great too.&&They didn’t scrap House of Cards. However, the final season needed to be totally reworked after they had already started shooting. &&They were paid for their time. That's where their ""deserving"" ends. Spacey is bad for business, removing him is good for business. This isn't difficult.&&they still got paid. &&Even if he didn't do anything illegal, he did enough to get fired. End of story.&&There is no mention of him pushing Kate Mara into a subway train. Who has a trusted Wiki login? &&Well they have a revenue of close to $12 billion a year, but that doesn't mean they make $12 billion a year. They pay nearly $8 billion a year just for content rights to host all the movies and shows. Their profits are rising though, they are project to profit about half a billion this year.

But the point still stands, in the grand scheme of things $39 million isn't all that much for them to just eat the cost, especially in terms of potential PR damages.&&The real question is..  who even wants one after the last hot garbage of a season?&&The final season premieres next month&&Why even care? Spacey made that show.&&Last season shows Claire being President, standing over Frank's grave.

~""When people come to pay their respects to me Frank, they'll need to stand in line, and it won't be in some back yard.""&&Cosby was funny at one point too.&&He will be back in a few years. don't worry. &&He was found guilty of being bad for business.&&The first lawsuit against him was filed last month.

Anyway, I don’t know how anyone could interpret his “if I did it, I’m sorry” apology as anything other than him admitting to it strategically in a way that doesn’t incriminate him.&&No, but if I recall, after being accused of molesting a boy, he said something along the lines of ""I could have when drunk, btw I'm gay""

He didn't categorically deny the allegations, and when being accused of being a pederast, he told the world he is gay. I feel like that was a shitty move, basically tossing the gay community under the bus. My friends in the LGBTQ community agree.&&Guilty in the media court.&&It's not the single accusation that sunk him. It was decades of accusations. When that one person made the accusation public, all of a sudden there was something like eight incidents from the house of cards set alone.

Given the speed with which he was dropped, it seems very likely that this was one of those ""Best Kept Secrets"" sort of things. People in the industry knew or suspected Kevin Spacey's behavior for years.  That one public accusation didn't bring him down alone, it was the straw that broke the camel's back.&&*spends 40 million firing a dude* 

You think we care about some change dropping under a guys shoe while we aren't looking kiddo?

*Slides boris a few more hundred thousand*&&Thats gross income and doesn't account for what they use. Net income, which is how much is left over and goes to the shareholders, last year was 558 million though. 39 million is approx 7% of that. Which is a sizable chunk, equal to 3500 bucks in a hypothetical 50k/year income.&&[deleted]&&What? No, making a song about diddling kids is the surest way to make people think you diddle kids!&&Gotta be big. Older than my wife older than my daughter&&Do I look suspicious?&&I think we did a PSA on that in Canada, it was called ""Don't you put it in your mouth"".&&JUST TO BE CLEARRRRRRRRR&&>The 59-year-old was convicted in 1988 of the sexual molestation of Nathan Forrest, the 12-year-old actor and star of his film “Clownhouse.” Salva videotaped the sexual act and was also convicted of possessing commercial videotapes and magazines containing child pornography.

>Salva only served 15 months of his three-year sentence, and he somehow went on to have a career in Hollywood in the years that followed. Disney hired him.

What!? How did this one never gain more traction?&&And Roman Polanski, who literally won an Academy award but can’t even enter the United States.
  
Hollywood is disgusting.&&And Roman Polanski. I'm really disappointed with a lot of my favourite actors choosing to work with him.&&I thought he was sacked from the x-men movie, did he manage to find work elsewhere or something?&&Quite a lot of Hollywood disagrees apparently.&&No. I mean the main issue Netflix had was that there was a report that Kevin Spacey basically created a bad working environment by sexually harassing loads of people there. There's nothing unusual about a company firing an employee because he was abusive to his co-workers. &&I don't think so, not technically. He didn't deny it too hard though. An apology mixed with a refutation isn't really a strong denial. If he didn't do it then he should have said that and refused to show any guilt or blame. Instead he aplogized and more or less shifted the conversation to revealing his homosexuality.

After his announcement, allegedly some of the crew from HoC reported sexual misconduct on his part but as far I know none of them were underage. So theres no real evidence that he molested a minor. There have long been Hollywood rumors about him taking advantage of minors and Anthony Rapps testimony was damning once Spacey made his ""wasn't me but I'm sorry anyway"" statement.

Legally, hes innocent. And thats a good thing because theres no hard evidence. But this is one of those rare cases where I feel the court of public opinion did the right thing and Netflix tanked his career as justice.

He was one of the elite in acting but he'll probably never act again.

Edit: Gonna disable inbox replies as I didn't expect this comment to make it above the negatives, tbh. This stuff triggers my anxiety hard. Full disclosure, I was a victim of a false accusation of sexual assault, so I am heavily in favor of taking a rational, fair approach to sexual allegations. Absolutely, we should investigate accusations of sexual assault as it's a very serious crime. I support *victims*. Part of supporting victims, to me, requires us to determine *who* is the victim. Is it the accuser or the accused? It is very possible to support both parties up until a determination is made on whether the accused is guilty or not. Not enough people realize this, sadly. This should go for any kind of accusation, not just ones relating to sexual assult.&&Proven? Maybe not but it's been an open secret for years and he's friends with and attends Bryan Singer's parties, which basically involve swimming pools full of sixteen year old boys. &&I'm going to need a source on the Rob Lowe bit...&&> every rock musician in the seventies

Including Bowie.&&I prefer Tom Cruise the Scientologist to Kevin Spacey the kid-diddler&&There are a lot more people involved in making a movie that had their careers hurt by the movie not coming out.

I feel for them not having any publicity due to one man's poor decision making.&&I gotta agree with you. He's done some really shitty things in real life, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying amazing films like The Usual Suspects or American Beauty (even if this movie holds a certain level of irony now)&&I can almost agree with that, except I don't want to see any fraction of what I paid go to him.&&I'd pay for him to wrap up House of Cards...so I feel you. &&and then the new actor gets an Oscar nom&&Pardon the ignorance, what movie was it from Scott that kicked Spacey to the curb? &&I believe Ridley did it solely because of that. He did it for marketing as well because he claimed they worked for free to do this for the victims but that was simply not true in the slightest. &&Yeah and Conan demanded that they take care of his staff before he would accept any settlement, because unlike NBC he actually cares.&&That's an important thing to remember about most acts like Conan, it's not just Conan. He's got an entire team of people who follow him around and do every aspect of his show.&&[deleted]&&What happened with Conan? &&Oof. And the potential loss of employees because they couldn’t make the move. After 8 months they would not have stayed unemployed.&&Not American so don't really hear about these things - what happened with Conan?&&If Larry Brown did half the stuff Kevin Spacey did, he wouldn't have.&&I still cant figure out what they were thinking on hiring her. All she did on FOX was show up and do segments where she bitched. I mean this is the status quo of most of the programming on FOX but thats all she did.


The Today Show is 98% feel good moments. It's easy and friendly entertainment. So they hire Megyn Kelly to expand the team? I mean the line up is Al Roker doing the weather and two women drinking wine and having a great time. Management decided to invite the person from class that would remind the teacher that homework was due 5 minutes before dismissal.&&NBC has to pay out $69 mil for the rest of her contract. That's not counting any lawsuits she might bring.&&Sorry.

Office and to spend 5 minutes browsing your queue before turning on the office.&&Ya been meatballed!!&&I don't know what it's like in your country, but in the U.S. if you go to most Thrift shops you can buy full seasons on DVD for like $4-5. Obviously it's less convenient, but that's one option.&&Gotta move to Denmark. &&VPN, brother.&&I finished watching it this morning. 

It was pretty great, different from your usual plot with more focus on internal strife (and heavy focus on introducing yet another iconic villain) but good.&&That ten minute, single- shot, prison scene was phenomenal. &&Season 2 is bat shit crazy....because Ninjas&&Why would you cancel your friend's account?&&Narcos is in November though. &&I never hear anyone talking about punisher and i loved it. Granted, it's just a guy running around going ""uuhhaaaaahhhhh!"" while shooting stuff but I really enjoyed it for what it is.&&Punisher i feel was so underrated.  Loved it&&It's almost hard to imagine the same production people work on daredevil as rest of the defenders.  


Daredevil is just a whole another level then any comic book show.&&I also think if they aren’t carful with this they will have a harder time getting people to commit to watching new shows. Why get into it if it’s likely it will just get canceled? I recently started watching the forever show. Took a few episodes to hit its stride. Now I wonder if it will ever have a second season.&&Yup, I was disappointed to see Marco Polo cancelled, especially after they left it on a cliffhanger. But tbf it did cost Netflix an insane amount of money with the settings, props and costumes.

Now they cancelled Luke Cage as well tho... smh&&so they put up all their pilots for streaming basically

&#x200B;&&Except several freshman (S1) shows were cancelled this year. I’m still super disappointed that *Everything Sucks* isn’t getting at least a second season. &&Netflix outright owns those shows. Why would they cancel shows for the sole reason of letting their new competitor use them instead?&&Anecdotally I know a lot of people that watched every Marvel show EXCEPT Iron Fist. It's cancelation didn't surprise me at all.&&Iron Fist might be done. It wasn't getting good reviews. I couldn't make it through the first 4 episodes of the first season. I thought it was extremely boring and I just couldn't get into it&&They could be combining for Heroes For Fire and no longer need their own shows &&I'm holding out hope Luke Cage and Iron Fist were canceled in order to combine the characters into a [Heroes For Hire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_for_Hire) show. &&Just like Cosby. No one cared when the first allegation came to light some 15 years ago. The more recent allegations are what did him in.&&Nailed it. 

Remember how James Franco got hit around the time that The Disaster Artist came out? Word got out that he had been texting teenage girls and Hollywood collectively ruined his chance at getting any major awards for his role.

Which is one thing. But unless there’s some kind of Mandela effect that only hit me, I remember when those allegations came out back around 2014 or 2015. The response was essentially “Yup, there goes weird ass James Franco again” and it was dropped almost immediately. 

Hollywood as a whole has always been okay with covering up abuse because people never wanted to speak out. Now that speaking out makes you woke and puts you in public favor, it’s okay, and NOW that’s why celebrities suddenly care. I love her body of work but I can't forgive Meryl Streep for having the nerve to speak out against Weinstein after giving Roman Polanski a standing ovation and showering him with praise.&&took those hypocritical cunts long enough&&Also who's dictating the cultural zeitgeist at the time. Rich old men were sort of on top culture wise when Polanski raped a girl, now far more progressive twitter millennials seem to be pushing the spotlight onto certain people.&&Though I'd not lump Gunn with Spacey&&40 million down the tubes is going to hurt anyone. It's just not a serious wound. &&I wish that were me&&Neither is Kevin Spacey.&&Lost 25% of their recent market cap high counts as hurting.&&Pearce or Crowe? because they're both great in it. Hell, everyone is great in it. It's a case study is great character acting. &&Rollo Tomassi?&&The only upside for them there is how they ended the last season. Makes it very easy to cut him out&&The last season was so shit anyway I'm not getting my hopes up for the last one. The show ends when  he becomes president - change my mind.&&That show lost its luster the season prior. I have very low expectations for next season. &&The right answer right there.  

They were paid and did their job. Maybe the director or screenwriter might be bummed but they got their money as well.&&This is what a lot of people miss. You aren’t held to the same standard of evidence when you fire someone. Getting fired from a job is not the same as getting arrested.

And people complain about how he was only tried and sentenced in the court of public opinion, but the court of public opinion is extremely important for Kevin Spacey’s job. Kevin Spacey didn’t get hired because he was good at acting. A lot of people are good at acting. He got hired because he can put butts in seats. Acting is just a means to that end. Studios will hire a shitty actor if that actor can bring in audiences. But, since all of this came out about Kevin Spacey, he’s no longer able to draw in audiences, which means he actually can’t do his job. &&HELP HELP THE SECRETARY HAS FALLEN&&That’s true, but any ending is better than no ending, I guess...&&[deleted]&&Exactly. The decision to can someone from a TV show doesn't require a standard of proof as if we were sentencing them to prison. A company is well within their rights to do this if a star's reputation would be bad for business.&&Also I chose to now live as a gay man.&&As a gay man, these were my thoughts:

When I read his official response, I could barely understand what his intention or reasoning could be. Has denying his sexuality for four decades warped his perception that much? Does he hate himself for being gay that much?

What relevance is being a gay wino to being accused of assaulting a child? I'm gay. I drink. I've never harmed a child. That excuse is more insulting to intelligence itself than it is to gay men.

It's hard to understand how someone who has acted as a cold, calculating, strategist in several movies and television shows could be so goddamn stupid.&&The worst court of them all.

Someone *supposedly* does something wrong and gets crucified, despite the truth of the situation.

But Spacy practically admitted to it soooo...&&🎵Do not diddle kids, it’s no good diddling kids🎵&&Can't be younger than my wife, younger than my daaaughter, something like that.&&Trust me, on the way over here I threw a bottle at a dog and he hollered real loud.&&not a little ki~id, something like thi~is&&I would hope that by default someone older than your wife is older than your daughter. &&(Dennis breaking in the reverse shot)&&I believe its younger than his wife, older than his daughter.

Edit: looks like I was wrong&&You look grotesque.
Your face is all busted to bits. &&That incident upsets me greatly and I have no idea how it's been swept under the rug. First, Nathan Forrest Winters has done everything he can to expose Salva's behavior to others. He protested his Disney movie (Powder), has done nationwide speaking tours, and he's doing a documentary. 

Secondly, how can allegations take down someone as rich/powerful as Spacey but not Salva? Especially since Salva's are definitely not just ""allegations"". There was video proof. &&And also had a huge number of high profile figures in Hollywood sign a petition to have him released from custody in Europe such as Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese &&This brings an old ethical dilemma: is the best actor in the world deserving of an acting award if he is morally the worst person in the world?

PS: I'm not trying to advocate anything here, alright?&&It's not just Hollywood, it's humanity. The same problem exists in the business world, politics, etc. If you have enough money/power to be useful to people, they'll ignore pretty much anything.&&It bothers me when people say the problem is ""Hollywood"" because that implies the problem is limited in some way to Hollywood. I saw people say that a lot during all the #MeToo stuff. It's NOT Hollywood, it's everywhere in America. You just hear about Hollywood more because the media reports disproportionately on celebrities. Like if sexually abusive behavior is this bad among the people who have the biggest spotlight on them and the most to lose, imagine how bad it is everywhere else. &&PEOPLE, people are disgusting. Don't act like this kind of behavior is reserved just for Hollywood.&&Seriously, I saw the poster for Carnage and was super excited to see some of my favorite actors together. Then I saw Polanski directed it. Real fucking disappointed.&&He quit voluntarily if I'm not mistaken. And he's being offered 10 million to direct the Red Sonja movie. &&And the Catholic Church. &&From what I heard, this is why a bunch of male crew members grew beards. They realized that Spacey found beards unattractive, and wouldn't mess with the men that had them.&&And just like that...he vanished&&No one can knock him for his acting. He is/was an amazing actor in things like American Beauty and House of Cards. That said, he has royally fucked himself for the acting scene. While legally, he hasn't been charged, the way he defended himself from the accusation was appalling. Like, who the fuck answers an accusation with ""I didn't do it, and also, I'm gay""? Now, however, the question is if he'll be able to bounce back into acting. He could, much like Mel Gibson who we know for certain went off on a tirade of antisemitism, but them again, there's a big difference between ""fucking jews"" and ""I choose now to live my life as a gay man"".&&I know people who worked on House of Cards with him (crew, grip, etc...) 

My understanding is he definitely likes them young, but not necessarily under age. And there was some kind of ""incident"" in season 1 that they paid a lot of money to keep quiet, but I don't know the details. &&Also, he killed that journalist. &&Imo, where he went wrong was in shifting the conversation to coming out. I think it was kind of okay how he was basically like ""i don't remember it happening, but it might've... And if it did, I'm sorry"" 

Atleast for the initial guy that came forward, i didn't follow anything with the HoC crew.&&He made a sex tape with a 16-year-old in the 80s.  Not sure if he was aware of her age.  &&Also the girl was old enough to have sex, but not to be filmed.&&Scientology as a whole has definitely done more harm in this world than one kid-diddler.&&Tom Cruise has done SO much for Scientology which has done countless awful things to human beings and families&&They can still put it on their resume, it sucks for them that the movie didn't get out, but there's probably lots of shitty movies on most peoples resumes that no one saw.

He will always be the GOAT late night host to me. Im too ""young"" to remember Johnny Carson.&&the signature conan hair whoosh thing doesn't take care of itsself &&like jordan schlansky!&&His ratings when he took the Tonight Show from Jay Leno weren’t as good as Jay hosting, and Jay Leno’s own show was hot trash and also getting bad ratings, so Jay wanted the Tonight Show back and NBC essentially fired Conan and gave it back to him, after Conan had been with the network for 20 years. They paid Conan a settlement but he refused to agree to settle until he had assurance that all the staff that were being laid off would be properly taken care of. 

Then he did a tour for the better part of the year before getting his show on TBS, which is really letting him do what he wants without interference at all. &&[Here is an abridged version of the Conan vs Leno saga featuring Steven Ho, the martial artist who would show up on the Tonight Show with Conan and beat him up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PrigUG9M_s)&&About ten years ago he took over The Tonight Show from Jay Leno but NBC pulled the plug after less than a year. NBC had to negotiate a contract release.&&I wasn't actually trying to say Kevin Spacey will make a comeback it's just the first thing I think of when people get paid shit tons of money to not work is Larry Brown. I don't remember which team but I think one of the team owners who fired him and paid millions actually said ""it's worth it to never see him again"".&&I’ll bet Andy Lack loses his job over it before too long. It was just such a stupid idea. &&NBC has been the king of stupid decisions since forever.  They have 2 late night talk show debacles and several Today Show messes under their belt.  They fucked up when they got rid of Ann Curry and not reigning in Matt Laurer when that whole thing went down and they should have never hired a notorious Fox News host then try and turn her into Oprah.  

And this is straight up IMO but I also feel like they didn't support Brian Williams as much as they could have.  They've pretty much stuck him in MSNBC limbo and cost themselves a well liked personality.  &&Excuse me, they drink [mimosas in the morning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0z3gCFXHj0)&&People have complained shows like Today are too light while GMA can occasionally have serious journalism. Megyn was a hot figure with constant coverage thanks to her personal beef with Trump. She hoped to go mainstream and failed, first with her evening show because she talked to Alex Jones and then her morning show which tried to make her otherwise serious image into a light and fun show. &&You get a Fox News person to bring in conservative viewers who would have otherwise never watched. &&Because she showed a modicum of intellectual curiosity and journalistic integrity on Fox in between segments of her railing at the fact Santa and Jesus are white. That, and after Trump started attacking her personally people felt a sort of affinity for her and forgot she is, at her very core, just a Fox News pundit through and through. &&The perception at the time that she had shifted from being a conservative to a moderate because of her spats with Trump. She was on top of the world with her book at the time NBC was bidding for her. If she could have toed that line of being able to speak to conservative as well as liberal mom's in a sensible way, I'm sure the goal was to make her the morning Oprah. 

Also, she's hot. Not to be sexist but you just don't see ugly people taking these roles. &&If they pay her out fully then she has no legal ground to sue. I mean she can file but she will surely lose. There is definitely a clause in her contract that gives NBC the right to exit the contract on agreement of payout. These contracts are written lawyers with years of experience. They know all the loop holes.&&Just finished rewatching The Office for the 90th time...I guess it's time to rewatch Parks&Rec again!  

&&I think I fall into this category &&Don’t forget P&R. &&It's about the convenience of watching stuff from my phone/tablet.

Also, the knowledge of the office is literally non existent in my country. I found out about it when abroad and watched it already like 5x all over. &&Or Norway if you don't fancy swallowing a potato. :)&&Nadeem’s a great character as well&&The Hand could never hold up to Fisk as a villain.

I barely even remember the plot of season 2. Saw it all when it came out but it didn’t stick with me&&Oh, are you friends with your exes?&&No dreamy ass Pedro Pascal, no deal&&Agreed. The Punisher was up there too, but the rest of the shows are poopoo.&&Hell, BoJack doesn't really turn into the show people love until the very end of S1, to the point where a couple of sites re-reviewed it. This is nothing new for Netflix.&&I think some of the Netflix shows have a first episode problem. They get good eventually but the first episode or two is really hard to get into. And by then it may be too late for many viewers. 

I thought the first episodes of Jessica Jones S2 and Luke Cage S2 were dreadfully slow. JJ was so bad it took me a month to bother coming back to it. The I ended up binging the rest of the season in a couple of days because it became interesting. 

They need someone in there overseeing and making sure the first episode is engaging and makes you want to see what happens next.  Or else people might just not bother. &&Macro Polo was so well done, I quite enjoyed it.  Though it did feel a little like softcore porn at times.

I'd like to see the Shogun book done in a similar style as a mini series.&&Sense8 :( atleast we got a finale tho. &&I'm actually really surprised they cancelled Luke Cage. I thought the second season was pretty strong. The first season did so well it broke Netflix at release. &&I mean, it makes sense. You don't have limited time slots like you used to, and you've already spent time making a pilot. Plus there are plenty of ideas that no studio exec would've guessed would find an audience until they actually did.&&Marvel also owns the rights.

It's going to be a messy situation.

I just really want Daredevil season 4, in the end, tho.&&Shame because Season 2 was pretty decent, and the end was pretty good at setting up future events with 2 Iron Fists running around, and Danny Rand using Iron Fist empowered gunkata.&&I know a few that couldn't make it through Luke Cage. It was so clumsy. Claire's the best thing about IF and LC. Season 2 of LC was so much better, but the effects at the end were atrocious. I'd like to try Heroes of Hire, but tbh I need a Night Nurse mini-series. &&Yeah but I found season 2 much better. Still Finn Jones isn't good but the other characters were pretty good.&&No one seems to care that David Bowie raped a 14 year old girl either. Weird what people pick and chose to be outraged by.&&[deleted]&&It's just a flesh wound.&&Sure. Losing $20 would technically hurt me, I guess. But I won't lose any sleep over it.&&Maybe not financially, but I'm guessing he was much happier before everyone hated him. &&They ended last season with, in part, an aside in which Frank threatened to kill Claire. I guess they’ll just forget about that the way AD ditched a number of season 4 plot lines. &&Nobody should change your mind.

It’s like they had no idea what so do w the show after he became president &&Seriously. I expected the season to start a few weeks after the last, after Frank had already won the election. Instead they give us half a season more of Frank ruining his competitor's life and hearing that one book writer dude drone on for hours at a time.&&I'm still on the fence on whether I'll watch it or not. The last few seasons were really bad, and Claire's character is not interesting to me at all. If it turns into the Claire Show I'll just be bored to tears. &&The season two ending was the true ending.&&They should make one last episode. It’s 10 minutes long and it ends with some country starting a nuclear war and everybody dies&&Just rewatch it, stop after season 3 and remember a great show.&&> wasting 10 hours of my life on a Claire circlejerk. 

 I mean, I absolutely would, but I know what you mean. I'm not interested without Spacey.

Edit: Clarifying, interested in the *show*.
&&Well, the point is that kind of shows never have real ending.
They are dragged as long as possible fueled by a hefty set of writers and the ""real"" end never happens. The end you see is usually some way to conclude all crazy threads in the story.

The real endings can happen for shows based on a book or if the series is designed completely from the beginning.
Like battlestar galactica (the second one).

Series like lost, friends, house of cards are usually not designed this way... I am not sure about breaking bad though.&&Do I look suspicious?&&https://youtu.be/_YmDcCpD1gc?t=23&&Nah the joke in the show was that he mixed them up and accidentally said gotta be older than my wife younger than my daughter&&Zeitgeist. No one really cares about Spacey more than this guy or Kashoggi more than the thousands of others murdered just as horifically. 

It just lands at the right time and place and suddenly becomes a talking point and before you know it it's the biggest news item.&&Spacey still has all his friends too.

These people just don't care about sexual assault or rape if it happens to someone else.&&Roman Polanski drugged and anal raped a 14 year old girl.

Pedowood won't get a cent from me.&&AKA separating art from the artist. Some do, some don't. Personal choice. Case by case for me.&&I think you can an appreciate what they did before they were found out, but they should get blackballed if they a a horrible person.

On the other hand, I don't think he would or should be voted in, if the voting took place today.&&Wow TIL that if I wanna meet Kevin Spacey, I should keep my beard. &&That's pretty horrifying that it got to that point.

""Hey kid, so... Kevin Spacey really likes getting handsy with all you young guys, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it so um... about the only thing you *can* do is grow a beard and maybe stop showering for the rest of production. Yeah.""&&So Spacey created the bearded hipster movement...Well damn&&Jesus, that's such a South Park plot line.

""You have to grow a beard. You have to grow a beard or Kevin Spacey will come get you.""&&Maybe Kevin Spacey was ultimately behind the beard trend in male fashion. So many dudes grew them as Spacey armor that it reached a critical mass and exploded from there.&&https://gfycat.com/sociabledeafeningjunco&&The quote is ""and like that... he's gone.""&&Someone smart- He knew headlines were going to be either ""spacey is gay"" or ""spacey is a sexual molester"", none were going to be ""spacey is gay and a sexual molester"" because it reads super fucking wrong.

It kind of worked until people started pointing out how fucking weird it was.&&You can definitely separate the art from the artist (I firmly believe you have to, otherwise there would be no art as most people have some sort of personal issue they deal with).

Like, who the fuck answers an accusation with ""I didn't do it, and also, I'm gay""?

There were already rumors about his taste for young men before any accusations came out but he was very secretive about his personal life. So his response was more like ""I don't remember that but it is possible because the rumors are true and I am in fact gay."" Basically, he was outed by the accusation so he was just acknowledging it. It wasn't meant as a defense. &&Also beheaded that schoolteacher wife of the man investigating him&&Yeah, it was more along the lines of ""I don't remember ever doing this, but I am sorry if I have hurt Mr. Rapp"".

The re-shoots needed to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer took eight days to film at a cost of $10 million. It also involved Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams having to return to the Rome set during the Thanksgiving holiday of 2017.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5294550/trivia?item=tr3693409

So, Netflix threw away 39 million, and Scott threw away another 10 for Plummer. I wonder what the overall total was to erase Spacey completely from all his project commitments. &&I can't afford that just to find out the title obviously, you'll need to lower your price.&&  **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)** &&There's a pun in here somewhere...&&Michelle Williams was also paid. But at $1500 compared to Wahlbergs $1.5 million. &&Reshoots were in Wahlberg's contract that he would be paid that much.  Williams did not have that in her contract.  Pretty simple difference in contract negotiations that was turned into the usual sexism debate. &&The larger your forehead, the more room you have for improvement. &&I totally agree; I love Colbert but damn is his show stale these last few months. I look forward to Seth’s show way more, but I agree that Conan has a unique show among them all, the awesome conventions and road shows, and he’s still a great interviewer. The funniest quick wit among them too. Damn you’ve made me realize I need to watch more Conan.&&And he doesnt focus solely on Trump,  it gets old having Trump in my head every day. &&Baby!&&That's pea*cork*, my Baloney.&&I love Conan too, but I'd put him at a close second to Craig Ferguson for GOAT late night host. That man could interview a rock and make the rock seem interesting. &&This description kind of ignores how the ratings drop was in large part related to the new Jay Leno show they were doing as the lead into local news being a total bomb.

&&Jay described it as entirely the network doing things when he talked about it on Maron, and he just agreed to whatever they were doing. Then again, I think Jay is biased. &&Well, that isn't the whole story and I'm sure my comment isn't either. Jay got bumped forwards in the schedule ahead of evening news. His ratings were terrible and affiliates complained because lead in show ratings are important. They have a cascading effect. If his ratings were bad, news ratings are bad, Conan's ratings are bad. They wanted to move Jay to 11 have Conan still do the tonight show but at 11:55. Conan said that that would no longer be the tonight show. It'd be the tomorrow show.

Leno had promised a peaceful transition and it kept Conan on the hook. He didn't leave for Fox (when they were kicking around the idea of a tonight show) or ABC. Similar bullshit happened with Letterman, Leno and Carson. Letterman used to have Conan's spot on NBC.

Everyone saw a ratings boost due to the late night wars. I think it helped Kimmel out the most.&&One important other detail is that he didn't just ""do a tour"" because he felt like it, his settlement with NBC prevented him from appearing on television for the better part of a year. That's why he did the ""legally prohibited from being funny on television"" tour during that time.&&Wait what?  10 years ago?

From *Variety*'s [10th Anniversary discussion](https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-reunion-vince-gilligan-1202674193/):
>Most of the decisions we made [were] solving a problem in that moment. Bob Odenkirk isn’t available, so we introduce this character, Mike. A lot of the things that seem like they’re part of a master plan — if there’s a master plan, it’s just trying to stay true to the characters and to the world that we’re in. One of the things I learned from the show was not to get too devoted to the big ideas, the master plan of what each season’s going to be about, but to track the characters on a moment-by-moment basis.&&House of Cards is actually based on an older British TV show about a cabinet whip similarly trying to become PM. Honestly, until the last season, I would say the general direction of the storyline have been pretty similar even if specific plot lines differ. I think if they wanted to, there's a very natural ending that they could have followed.&&You ever bang the dead bodies?&&You look grotesque. &&Yeah, I feel like if all that shit with this guy and Polanski and anybody else happened nowadays the firestorm that would start now with the advent of the internet wouldn't die down the way it could in the 90's or the 70's.

Depends on your goals. &&FWIW, this is something women do constantly. obvs its happening to men here but I hope you are also horrified by the silent, pervasive ways women have to adjust their behavior for creeps in and out of the workplace. I've done it loads in my career. Clients leer lecherously to the point where others are distracted by their creep vibes when I wear my (standard) sheath dress and pumps, gotta wear a long jacket or baggy tunic around them. Boss keeps asking me to sit on his desk and look at things on his screen while he keeps turning around to review a paper, gotta switch teams. New coworker will not stop looking me up and down and loudly commenting on my appearance, I'll dress like a slob even though it hurts my career, that didn't help, I'll try reporting, okay that was a nightmare of victim blaming and endless meetings asking me how I can stop being ""sensitive"" I'll quit that job... Yeah. I WFH now. (These are all real things that really happened to me.)&&What if you're in the unlucky gene pool who CAN'T grow a beard?

The second it happened everyone called it out as exactly what it was, a decoy. &&I agree. I will always re-watch Spacey content because he was just SO damn good. Even if he was disgusting as a person.&&The difference is that peeple can watch a movie made by Polanski or Woody and be unaware or simply forget about the person behind the scenes.  It's harder to watch an actor and completely forget who the real person is.  &&I honestly don't know if I could watch a movie made by those three, and let's say it's funded by Harvey Weinstein. 

It would be such a Trainwreck that I really don't know if I could look away&&Agreed. Other examples include Jimmy Snuka and Hulk Hogan of wrestling fame.

He is not just some random member. I would argue that Cruise has done far more harm promoting Scientology than Spacey did making unwanted sexual advances on minors. &&That’s right, I totally forgot about that. It is one of my favorite movies, one of Fincher’s best imo.&&So Kevin spacey was going to play a 90 y/o character? 



I only say 90 since that’s how he was portrayed in the movie IIRC

Just started another viewing of Friends (after That 70s Show, because I've already burnt through The Office/P&R on my ""falling asleep"", ""cleaning the house"", ""background noise"" rotation.  Although I did back to back to back The Good Place viewings when S2 hit.)

http://www.tmz.com/2017/09/25/narcos-star-pedro-pascal-location-scout-killed/&&You need to at least get to the episode where’s he’s forced to confront his dark past (he goes to see an old friend that is dying from cancer). At that point (I believe it’s episode 7 or 8) the show takes a MASSIVE, permanent turn.

From that point onwards it’s very much a show about depression, mental illness, and how different people cope with it. One character throws herself into their work, one character attempts to find deeper meaning and purpose, one character tries to cover it up with a firehose of happiness but you can occasionally see the cracks show through, and Bojack simply engages in self-destructive behavior.

It’s a very rough watch, especially the latest season, but it’s one of the more meaningful and impactful shows I’ve ever seen on TV. 

It’s also one of the only shows on TV to tackle complex issues like aseuxualism, #MeToo, and a bunch of other topics most shows won’t touch with a 10 foot pole. &&Push through it.

You say that like Allen doesn't star in half his movies&&For sure, it's just that the whole Rob Lowe thing isn't like he's a pedo or anything&&Sure, today that is a common threat.  But in the 80s, no one was going around warning people about that.  The law was treated much differently and enforcement wasn't the same.

Even today, it is still a joke that you are supposed to ID someone before having sex with them.  If someone is truly intending to go after underaged teens, there is going to be evidence around that and provable intent.  Meeting a rando at a 21 over club has no demonstrable intent.

It is a flaw in the law.  The law is designed so the state doesn't have to prove intent, but the flaw is that the law doesn't allow for the accused to prove a lack of intent.  So even if everyone knows you were not going after someone underaged, you are still guilty and still a sex offender.&&“Do you fuck with the war?”&&Technically I think J Paul Getty was 80 at the time, but yes they were going to have Kevin Spacey play a octogenarian. After the fact Ridley Scott claimed it was because at the time Kevin Spacey was a big deal, so they went with him just for publicity. Then we learned that Kevin Spacey was a naughty naughty man, and so they replaced him with Christopher Plummer, a man who actually is an octogenarian. If you think about it, Ridley Scott casting Kevin Spacey just for publicity actually worked out in the end, because after they cut Spacey out and replaced him with Plummer, they arguable got much more publicity than they would have is Spacey had stayed in the film.&&They plastered him in so much prosthetic crap he looked like a Jim Henson character.

Will Smith was definitely the best part of the movie and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished version.

But I actually don't mind. It sounds like I was apathetic, but it's just bizarre when you first hear the news of who's playing him. I've heard some people want Williams' voice to be reused, but doing that or trying to copy and recreate his Genie would be way worse than trying something new.

EDIT: So, I remembered reading at Disney's D23 Conference last year, they played a ""Will Smith rap"" for the movie at the conference. But it turned out to be a Will Smith rap parody by a comedian:

I liked the new Beauty and The Beast and Jungle Book, but I actually think this remake makes more sense than the other two. Those had a majority of non-human characters, so it seemed weird to do live action with them. Aladdin’s more humans besides the Genie, Abu, and Iago. &&Hold up.

I don’t think Will Smith is overrated, but I’d rather keep seeing him take challenging roles.

The name of the movie puts people in the seats. I would not be surprised if the actors besides Smith were chosen for budget reasons, basically blowing the whole star budget on Will Smith since he is notoriously expensive. &&Every single one of these live action remakes has made bank, the only name they need is “Aladdin” &&Eh. Maybe. It's also just kind of Disney's thing to rope in up and comers early so they can control and profit off as much of their career as possible. Plus they don't have to pay them nearly as much.&&also Guy Ritchie is directing, i mean  come on&&They hired ethnic actors for the roles. Since Hollywood never hires ethnic actors until very recently there are no a list stars they could have hired&&So far, it might be the ""best"" of the live action stuff, but the heavy drop of exposition at the beginning and some pacing/writing bogged it down some, least for me.&&Ehh... I had multiple problems with The Jungle Book. I'm not even that big of a fan of the original, but the 2016 version did very little for me. 

Baloo and Mowgli's relationship wasn't nearly built up enough or emotionally satisfying. The movie barely shows them sharing any meaningful dialogue or connection before it forces an ""emotional"" break up between the two.

The actor who played Mowgli often delivered his lines very stiffly, and it took me out of the illusion frequently. Many people counter with  ""Oh he's just a kid, and he was the only organic thing on screen,"" but remember that many kids are quite capable of performing spectacular monologues to absolutely no one. And if the kid was a good actor but just couldn't act without aids, Jon Favreau should have done more to make being in front of a green screen feel more natural to him.

The movie isn't a musical and doesn't incorporate most of the Disney Animated film's songs, yet it has a horrible rendition of ""I wanna be like you"" sung by Christopher Walken out of nowhere. It is ridiculously out of place.

Currently my favorite live action Disney remake is Cinderella (2015). It was different from the original in multiple points, and although I like the original more, It improved on the original in some areas. &&Mainly, they cast someone as Belle who can't sing, and also didn't have the warmth and sweetness of the character. Instead of just being quirky but smart and whimsical she ended up almost snobby and looking down on other people for not being as intellectual as she was. There are a lot of details that don't matter as much, but the casting and portrayal of the character was a big issue for me. &&1. Emma Watson was just not interesting. Her performance was bland though maybe I can't fault her too much because she was staring at green/blue screens for the majority of it. Her  singing voice was too little for such grand songs.

2. I felt they rushed through the parts we already knew from the cartoon and slowed down at the new stuff. But I didn't find the new stuff that interesting. Except the first scene between Belle and Maurice.

3. It played it too safe. It was a rushed version of the original. I'd be more forgiving if it did something new with the story. Exactly what? I dunno. But all I know is while watching it, I was thinking Id rather be watching the animated version.

I did like Maurice, Gaston, and Lefou and thought the castle looked great. But they weren't enough, for me. But if you enjoyed it, glad you did.&&I loved it, too. I watch both versions of the movie a lot. &&Bell's voice was super auto tuned and it was distracting. I even heard it auto tune jump at one point. The sound editing in general was lazily done.

At least we know the chase scene with Alladin and the guards at the beginning will be bonkers&&Trailer was the best part of that film.&&I agree with pretty much all of this. The Cinderella movie felt incredibly padded and at times was unbearably boring, but the set and costume work was enough to keep me engaged for most of it, plus Helena Bonhman Carter is always awesome. The only thing I’m really getting out of any of these remakes that isn’t already present in the originals are the visuals.&&They shouldn't have gone with Emma Watson, there's no doubt about that. She was auto-tuned to death, too. So much of the joy of that movie comes from the music so it really tarnished it for me. &&I thought the movie overall was actually really well done - Gaston knocked it out of the park - but the biggest draw of 'Beauty and the Beast' is Belle and Emma Watson just didn't deliver. Belle has so much wonder, imagination, and spirit, and Emma played her so straight and boring. I didn't believe that she actually wanted to leave that poor, provincial town. Plus, her singing voice was bad. I can't even call it mediocre because it was just bad. Love the actress, but she was not meant for that role.&&Emma Watson was chosen for her name and name alone.&&Until the end credits I couldn't figure out if Lefou was Jack Black or not. He was not.&&Same here. I love the original. I loved the new one. I love both. It is possible to enjoy something new while acknowledging you still love the original.

Sequels aren't remakes.&&Well, the Cinderella and Jungle Book live actions did make changes to the story. It also added things to the characters and fleshed them out more compared to the originals, so I can see enjoying those versions in addition to the older films. And audiences today aren't as familiar or obsessed with the original films since they came out a longer time ago. 

Beauty and the Beast was basically a shot-for-shot remake with the same songs and virtually the same look for everything, based on a movie that virtually everyone has seen within the last 10 years and probably has memorized. When you get into remaking recent classic films without changing anything, it's a lot worse. &&I had heard they're rolling out all these modern versions of their golden-era animations to renew the copyright licenses on the IPs. I think it's also a convenient bonus that they'll make a ton off of them.  &&You’re it wrong but from what I’ve heard they have Guy Ritchie a lot of freedom on this one.

&&You don't know what you want, only the mouse knows and provides.&&An adaptation of the Broadway show would be nice for Aladdin. Dumbo and The Lion King don't really need remakes in the same way.&&Aladdin was a special brand of cultural misrepresentation. As a little girl it was awesome seeing a princess that looked like me but watching it again, it's a horrible representation of whatever cultures they were hoping to represent. But I can forgive it and enjoy it for what it was because 90s and nostalgia. I'm not looking forward to the remake because honestly, why? But I'm hoping it isn't as culturally insensitive as the first movie. Dumbo and Lion King really don't need live action movies.

EDIT: *Existing IP that was cel-animated before&&I'm hoping the Aladdin remake will add in some stuff from the Broadway musical (namely ""Proud of Your Boy,"" ""High Adventure"" and the characters of Babkak, Omar, and Kassim and the Sultan's reprise of ""Prince Ali,"" not to mention a few other songs.)&&That isn't how copyright works. Disney already fought to make copyrights last the life of the creator plus 70 years. They will just pay the government to extend it again. We are the first generation to have nothing enter public domain in our life time. &&Live action the little mermaid is going to be awkward as hell.&&It's Disney so I'm assuming that's part of it. If not ""renew the copyright licenses on the IPs"" specifically (I'm not sure that's how it works,) then at least something along those lines. 

But if that's the case wouldn't they be starting with Snow White and Pinochio, their two earliest films? Beauty and the Beast is only 27 years old at this point, and Aladdin is only 26 years old. 

Cinderella and The Jungle Book are both over 50 years old at this point so it would make sense if Disney needed to renew their IPs on those two. &&Burton's whole old school crew. I'm stoked for Danny Devito, Michael Keaton and Elfman scoring.&&_I-I love pink_  
_Elephants!_  
_They make me feel so good_&&I remember reading something around the time of D23, when they showed off the first footage of Circle of Life. Jon Favreau, who already did his damnedest to preserve the charm of the original Jungle Book while also fleshing it out, said that the pressure of that is upped tenfold with Lion King and that he's doing everything he can to keep the majesty of the original intact.

I don't doubt him at all. He did a phenomenal job with Jungle Book, so I'm looking forward to this.&&Your daughter is a sociopath&&Yeah, I am a bit torn, I think just subjectively I like the look of the other posters where it is a close up of a single object.  But, another commenter brought up the Jungle book and [the poster](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jungle-book-poster-hi-res.jpeg) is a shot of  Mowgli in the Jungle with Bagheera. 

So, having the Lion King be the sunrise or pride rock would work.&&Sunrise landscape is good but cave painting fits this theme better. &&It looks like it was this [poster](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jungle-book-poster-hi-res.jpeg), if so, they could probably do a landscape.&&Same! I've been waiting so long. I hope they get it right because I want to see all of the books on screen. Especially the last 3-4 ones, which just took it to another level entirely (Atlantis Complex and Last Guardian are my favorite because of the amazing character work tied into the huge stakes)

They could do it like the M:I/Harry Potter series and switch up the directors for each film depending on the tone of the book its based on. 
Artemis is one of my favorite characters of all time in anything ever. Mulch, Foaly, Root, Trouble, and Butler too. 

Also, Eoin Colfer recently confirmed that they aren't combining books and that Kenneth Branagh decided the first book was more than enough material. And he saw a tiny bit of footage of Root that he said was really funny and really liked. I'm thinking they'll make her kinda like Ice Cube was in the Jump Street movies - Over the top extreme badass. 
So that gives me hope that it could be pretty good. Still gonna keep my expectations low so I can enjoy it no matter what. And even if it isn't stellar, there's always the books. I've been meaning to re-read them for a while anyway. &&Just looked.  Am officially concerned.&&Right? I'm deeply concerned it'll ruin the world I built while reading. &&Because Disney owns like half the movies market.&&*checks Beauty and the Beast and Jungle Book box office numbers*

Has any other actor played the same role for so many years that it started as a ""new, fresh take warranting of an oscar"" and later devolved into ""nobody would complain if we nominate this for a Razzie""?","Sly Stallone with Rocky. The original Rocky won Best Picture and Sly was nominated for Best Actor. 9 years later, when Rocky 4 came out, it “won” lots of razzies.

Rocky was my initial thought when the question was posed, but I was expecting it to be for Rocky 5, not 4. 

Edit: turns out he was nominated for razzies for Rocky 5 too, but 4 came up first on my initial google search.

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I love Rocky 4. It ended the Cold War. I originally thought Rocky 5 would be where Sly got the razzie, because that’s still unanimously panned for being awful. That being said, I can see why it maybe didn’t play as well when it first came out. It’s very cliche 80s, which we love while looking back on it, but i get people thinking it was too much when it came out. Rocky kinda got Flanderized, which we now love, but made people groan at the time.&&Pat Morita was nominated for an Oscar for Karate Kid I and a Razzie for the third instalment. &&[deleted]&&Pat Morita was nominated for the best supporting actor in 1985 for playing Mr. Miyagi in “Karate Kid.”

Morita was nominated for worst supporting actor in 1990 for playing Mr. Miyagi in “Karate Kid Part III.”&&But the cool thing about the Rocky thing was that it then turned around and he is nominated for  best supporting actor for creed which he is playing Rocky. That's a turnaround.&&Tugg Speedman. The first Scorcher movie was hot.

He’s the Han Solo of the story. An interesting co protagonist with a mysterious backstory. He adds flavor but isn’t the meat. The subsequent films showed this when they tried to make the story about him and his past ruining the mystery behind his character. 

Furthermore future jack is terrible. A lot of the novelty that made jack jack (his smart thinking and planning) doesn’t show up subsequently. Jack is no longer acting but reacting. He’s being dragged around rather than being the one taking agency.&&Nickelback won Artist of the decade in the US, and won Worst artist of the decade in the UK on the same year. &&There's a Pirates 5??&&I feel like the shity writing gets a pass a lot of the times. Actors can't magically make bad writing good, well John Goodman aside.&&Johnny milked it until people just got sick of it. No surprise really. &&I wouldn't put too much stock in the Razzies. The nominated The Shining for several awards too.&&Stallone in Rocky and Rocky V?&&That first pirates movie was perfect. Just a fun romp that pretty much any age could watch and enjoy. Then they just needed to drive it into the fucking ground. &&He spent all his money on scarves and now he just needs a paycheck.&&Not an actor, but Ennio Morricone's *The Thing* score (which is actually fucking awesome) was nominated for a Golden Raspberry. He won an Oscar for his *The Hateful Eight* score which contained some unused material from *The Thing*.&&Liza Minnelli was praised for her performance in *Arthur*, and while she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for that role, she was nominated for a Golden Globe and has an Oscar for *Caberet*. She eventually won a Razzie for playing the same role in *Arthur 2: On the Rocks*

*The Godfather Part III* was nominated for 7 Oscars but didn't win any. It did win 2 Razzies for Sophia Coppola (Yes, they gave her 2 Razzies for that performance). She would eventually win an Oscar for writing *Lost in Translation*

Michael Douglas won an Oscar for *Wall Street*, while co-star Daryl Hannah won a Razzie for her role in the movie. This is the only movie so far to win both an Oscar and a Razzie&&Don’t think it happened but I can imagine one of the Indiana Jones films getting an Oscar and Crystal Skull getting a Razzie.&&For everyone replying with people that have won a razzie and also an Oscar(sometimes in the same year), this isn't what op was asking, the question was specifically about the same role an actor played that ended up winning both. Most of these reply are interesting but not at all what op asked.&&Besides Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, both Talia Shire and Burt Young have been nominated for Oscars and Razzies for their roles as Adrian and Paulie respectively as well. 

Talia Shire was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for *Rocky* and Worst Supporting Actress Razzie for *Rocky IV*

Burt Young was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for *Rocky* and Worst Supporting Actor Razzie for *Rocky V*&&Sparrow has gone from being humorous but very capable, to pure comic relief. It's very sad really.

I put this squarely on the writers.&&TIL there’s 5 pirates of the Caribbean movies &&I know it's not based on nominations, but Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The first one is the best action movie I've ever seen, and in the fifth one I walked out of the theater about halfway through. &&Two performances have actually been nominated for both the Oscar AND the Razzie in the same year. James Coco for  ""Only When I Laugh"" and Amy Irving for ""Yentl"".&&The razzies are not a real depiction of real bad movies and real bad actors, they are more a celebration of mediocre and misguided A-list attempts.  They are star fuckers.  They do not nominate the actual worst performances and worst movies that are unknown.&&In the first Pirates movie Jack Sparrow was a smart, cunning and resourceful pirate who had vices and quirks that made him fun. Everyone underestimated him and he knew it. He planned and carefully orchestrated what he said and did, while playing the fool.

Every other Pirates movie since has completely ignored his savvy side and made him into an actual fool who occasionally gets really lucky. &&Pirates 1- Jack Sparrow is a quirky pirate who catches people off guard by pretending to be incompetent and aloof but is actually rather clever and is always scheming and manipulating situations to his benefit.

Pirates 2-5- Jack Sparrow is incompetent and aloof but gets really lucky in humorous ways.

It’s sort of like the evolution of Homer Simpson. He went from kind of a doofus with a good heart to a total absolute moron who coasts through life on luck alone.&&Not an Oscar, but a Golden Globe. Burt Reynolds was nominated for a Golden Globe for the original Longest Yard and was nominated for a Razzie for the remake.&&Not entirely related but... I think the biggest problem in Pirates 5 was the writing and script, not the actor. Jack Sparrow was such a massive hit at first because he used one of the hardest tropes to do right, and one that is awesome to see in action, called the Obfuscating Stupidity (not gonna link it because TVT is an endless black hole).

In both 4 and 5 however he went from a very well crafted character to the usual moronic and lucky protagonist, everything that made his character good was completely scrapped. Personally, I don't think Depp's acting has anything to do with it.&&It's too bad **The Tourist** didn't get nominated for any Golden Raspberries.  Would have been hilarious for Depp and Jolie to be nominated for Golden Globes **AND** Golden Raspberries for the same roles in the same movie.&&It’s funny though because Stallone went from being nominated for Oscars for Rocky to Razzies then back to Oscars with Creed. An absolute wild ride&&Stallone in Rambo. I don't know if he won any Razzies for it, but same thing as Rocky. First one was a cinematic masterpiece that showed the traumatic psychological effects PTSD had on soldiers trying to readjust to life after Vietnam. And then after that it was just chopshopped into one shitty action movie after another.&&Rocky and Rambo take it to the next level though and go full circle and go from good to bad to good again. The real question is what other franchises do THAT. &&Stallone won a golden globe when he reprised his role of Rocky in the Creed movie. &&Rocky 4 is the best one. I don't know why it gets the hate.&&Rocky 4 was awesome, it was Rocky 5 that was a complete shitfest.&&Same with Talia Shire. Nominated for Best Actress in Rocky at the Academy Awards, won the Worst Actress razzie for  Rocky V.&&Did his performance change in any way? I know the movies around him changed, but he's the same&&First of all, Pat Morita was Japanese, not Chinese!&&The Karate Kid is about Kesuke Miyagi, an immigrant who fought against his own people in World War II, while his wife lost a child in an internment camp. Noriyuki Morita was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Ralph Macchio? Showed up&&I beg to differ. Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago.&&TIL there was a sequel to Saturday Night Fever.

TIL that it was not good.&&Not quite the same swing in reception but he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Get Shorty and was critically panned playing the same character in Be Cool ten years later.  &&And he did it in only 2 movies. &&): I never watched all of them but the first one and Mr. Miyagi is one of my favorite films and characters.&&Actually really interesting point.&&What you are saying is there's going to be another movie where Rocky takes on the Russians again? &&Someone left the fridge open that’s why.&&Yeah but thank god we dont have to worry about the disaster that was Simple Jack&&But then won for his role in *Tropic Blunder: The True Story Behind the Making of the Most Expensive Fake True War Story Ever*.&&Tuggernuts&&Here we go again.

&&Thats what happens when you go full retard&&Okay, RocketSofa. Fuckface. 


First, take a big step back... and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE! Now, I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Reddit, Jack, is my territory. So whatever you're thinking, you'd better think again. Otherwise I'm gonna have to head down there and I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you! You're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you. I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker! I will massacre you! I WILL FUCK YOU UP!&&Let's face it, the kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher for Purim anymore.&&Suck my unit&&“Pirates of the Caribbean 6: The Haunted Crow’s Nest or Something Who Gives a Crap”&&This is my new favourite show. It’s just fun, the plot moves forward quickly, and Kristen Bell is just a treasure. &&“NOW PLAYING EVERYWHERE FOREVER”&&Well thats bullshirt&&Is that show any good?&&They should wrap up the pirates series by making the next one about Red from the ride. If they need Depp they can make him a Han Solo secondary character again, and much more mysterious and cunning.&&Holy forking shirt balls!&&The Blind Side and All About Steve.&&More than nominated, WON&&Never mind nominations, Halle Berry WON both, for Monster's Ball in 2001 & Catwoman only 3 years later.&&Didn’t she show up to the Raspberries and give everyone a DVD of the movie or something?&&I think OP is talking about for the same role, though. &&Yeah in #1 - #3 there was a constant story involving other people: #1 Will going after Elizabeth (and Jack wanting his ship back) , #2 everyone wanting the chest for different reasons (and Jack avoiding giving Jones his soul) and #3 Pirates vs East India Trading Company (and Jack facing pirate extinction / contemplating becoming the next Jones). 

For #4 and #5 it was just Jack doing basically whatever the fuck he wanted in a drunken haze and all the other stories taking a far back seat. 

There was also a clear lack of “cunning” in #4 - #5 Jack in the sense that the audience had no idea what his intentions were but in #3 for example there was a literal discussion with himself on whether he wanted to stab the heart or not. &&But... But people would love a movie just about Han Solo, right?

Right?&&Could you put this in a graph? &&For the same album?&&You know Disney CEO Bob Iger said the same thing.&&Yeah it came out last year. I saw it and can’t tell you a single part of the movie I remember. &&Do you have an example with John Goodman&&Yeah, but in Depp's case, there are reports he was terrible to work with on the last ones. He was paying someone to read his lines into an earpiece so he wouldn't have to learn them, and was rumored to be very erratic with arriving on set. &&>John Goodman

John Goodman make the flinstones surprisingly watchable for me&&Jack Sparrow was perfect in the first one. He was the lead but the plot didn't revolve around him. The 2 sequels that followed, while lesser in quality still gave him something of a character arc and the perfect ending to the character, his last scene is him searching his ship on a small boat, similar to his first scene. 

Unfortunately, they took parts 4 and 5 too far and removed all novelty that the character had and instead made him a caricature.

EDIT: My highest rated post now is about one of my favorite movie characters. Thanks everyone who updooted this comment!&&Huge reason for this was that in the first movie, the character Jack Sparrow wasn't written to be eccentric, the dialogue was made for a regular pirate. Depp made up the character and played it up but the lines stayed the same, grounding the character from being too ridiculous. 

After the huge success and popularity of Jack Sparrow though, the writers wrote him to be more and more ridiculous throughout the rest of the films, ruining the character. &&They also kknd of made him the main character, which doesn’t fit the role as well. There’s an excellent video somewhere explaining this. &&[deleted]&&I wouldn't even blame Johnny.  Disney milked it.  I like Jack, but removing Will and Elizabeth in the 4th movie and going all in on Jack was awful.&&>Johnny milked it until people just got sick of it. No surprise really.

I turned on Pirates 5 ready for more Jack Sparrow. . . But the movie was lazy. Turned it off halfway through.&&He also got extremely lazy. In the last pirates film he had all of his lines fed to him by earpiece.&&Just googled it, they nominated both Shelly Duvall for her performance AND Stanley Kubrick for worst director in only Razzies second year of existence. Unbelievable.&&Rocky -great
Rocky 2 -great
Rocky 3 -good
Rocky 4- okay campy enjoyable
Rocky 5 - dumpster fire
Rocky Balboa - surprisingly better than 4 and 5
Creed -great&&[deleted]&&Don't forget leather cuffs&&He spent all his money on wine. Wine is the word we were looking for. Isn't it like $40,000 a month?&&Holy shit, how would anyone with ears nominate The Thing's score for a Golden Raspberry? It's killer!&&Morricone has scored many of my favorite movies and can do no wrong in my eyes &&Just a quick technicality: the parts of TH8's score that we're nominated were the new parts. The ""For Your Consideration"" disc (and the actual score CD) for TH8 don't include the tracks from *The Thing*.

But yeah, *The Thing*'s score is phenomenal.&&Say what you will about Godfather Part 3 but Pacino's performance was amazing. If only they got someone else to play Mary.&&The Indiana Jones trilogy netted a collective 6 Oscar Wins (entirely technical). Crystal Skull only managed to win one Razzie (Worst Sequel).&&Aka most askreddit threads&&Yeah but then this thread would have 4 replies saying no and it’d disappear.  I think of it more like a starting point for osacar/Razzie discussion.&&Probably because it’s really not all that common and if the thread were reduced to it, well, we probably wouldn’t be here very long. &&was looking for this.   If he hasnt gotten a raspberry yet, Its certain to happen in the forthcoming #6, but he didn't win anything (deservedly so) for #1.   

Also my first memory of seeing Alan Rickman on screen.&&To me, popular successful actors being nominated for just one is already an act of pandering... but then both? It just shows how overrated those actors are, regardless of their performance.

Oh, it is Angelina Jolie! Oh, it is Johnny Depp!

It would be really nice these awards focused more on upcoming actors, or at least smalltime individuals. Right now, these awards are meaningless because it is just Hollywood scratching its own back.&&That does not bode well for Creed 4 & 5. &&Sly is laughing all the way to the blood bank!&&Also feels to me like the 80s. We look back and a lot of it is cringe, but some stuff is coming back again like outrun, and synth music.&&Interestingly enough, in 1986, Stallone was given the Razzie for both roles, Rambo (Rambo First Blood: Part 2) and Rocky (Rocky 4).&&For a long time I knew Rambo only by reputation. I finally saw First Blood a few years back and my mind was blown. Great fucking flick. Still havent warched any of the sequels as I'm positive its all downhill from there.&&Die hard too. Basically any cash cow series goes off the rail pretty hard at some point&&[deleted]&&This is a direct effect of listening to the audiance.  First Blood is great for the reasons you listed and so much more, yet I can almost guarantee that when they asked the test audiance what they liked about it they nearly all just said 'Rambo kicks ass'.  You can see it happen all the time in sequels, the minions from despicable me, the pop music stings in Guardians of the Galaxy and of course Captain Jack Sparrow from PoTC are all good examples of the test audiance effect. &&Hopefully Terminator...please&&Fast and Furious. The first is a decent enough undercover cop film with street racing. The second suffered from a lack of Vin Diesel. The third and fourth were pretty blah.

And then five comes around and it's arguably the best film in the series, with six and seven being decent too. I never saw eight, but by all accounts it's an OK film as well.&&And he deserved the Oscar. It’s ridiculous the guy from Bridge of Spies got it over Stallone. It was the best performance of Stallone’s career. &&If he dies, he dies. &&The credit for ending Cold War goes to Reagan, Gorbachev and Stallone in equal parts.&&Rocky 4 is my favorite one by a siberian wilderness mile, but the ""best"" one is probably still Rocky 1

It's like how filet mignon is objectively a better cut of meat than a bacon double cheeseburger, but ..&&Rocky 4 is 1/3 montage, what a film &&I don't think Rocky 4 is the best on a pure film-making level but it's by far the most fun. I think it was critically derided at the time of release but now people see it as ridiculous but very enjoyable.

5, on the other hand, is just bad.&&**HAPPYBIRTHDAYPAULIE**&&Because it's a ridiculous movie. Don't get me wrong, I do love it. But when compared to the serious tone of the original, it's really silly.&&Actually, Rocky 3 is the best one.

Best theme song, best antagonist, Mr T, best dialogue, Mr T, dancing in the ocean, Mr T....

But 4 has like a dozen montages in it :)&&Probably people who just wish communism won. &&Rocky is a perfect movie. The sequels got worse for every movie. By the time we got to number 4 we have gotten so bad it is good again.&&I agree, which is why I originally was thinking Rocky 5 would’ve gotten Razzies (which it did). I was shocked to learn Rocky 4 has a bunch of Razzies because it’s my favorite one.&&No. He’s the same. Just the script he was working with changed. &&I feel like I'm missing a reference to something.&&Well moron good for happy Gil mo oh my god!&&Thank you. This has me giggling and I know what movie to watch this weekend.&&Now go check out who directed it, for a nice TIL/WTF combo. &&First one is an outstanding 80s movie, and one of the most surprisingly best treatises on Okinawa karate in media. 

Second one is definitely worth a watch too. Three isn't as good, but the rebelling against your teacher theme is pretty good.

And then stop there. The one without Ralph Machio is pretty crap, and the kung fu remake with Will Smith's kid is hot fucking garbage. &&Creed II&&""here we go again..........again ""&&I wasn't that bad. He got so into the role that ""... I actually felt like I was retarded.""&&It’s the pecker. &&What the hell do you mean there's no T-vo?&&[deleted]&&“Or whatever, fuck you — you’ll still see it!

And he was in the next episode!
&&It's forking bulshirt&&It was made by the same director as The Office, Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn 99. Definitely has more of a fantasy feel but if you're a fan of any of those shows you will probably enjoy The Good Place.&&Best thing currently on TV. I absolutely love it. Would strongly recommend. &&First season took me a few episodes to actually decide it was something I wanted to watch, but it got very entertaining later on&&Yes!

I'm definitely not saying that it was the only thing wrong with them, there were many more factors that hurt the movies, but it was definitely a noticeable issue with the writing.&&It’s the same problem that happens with all sequels and TV series. Either they end too early or go on too long that it ruins all the greatness. My recent TV example is How I Met Your Mother it was so good for so long then it dragged on and ran out of interesting plots and the last season (arguably 2) are just dreadful. Same thing has happened with Pirates. It’s a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3, and I accepted the 4th for what it was. The 5th is nearly unwatchable except I think Javier Bardem’s character is a great villain. Bardem just does a great villain. &&1-3 ""How to play a chaotic neutral character""

And bloom meets his son. That's about it. &&I can remember how they wasted Javier Bardem.&&I think they stole a bank? Otherwise, it was a pretty forgettable movie&&Top 5 movie disappointments for me. Plot and movid had no stakes or scope at all. The entire movie is a straight line and lazy. 

We have this map that no one has been able to read, like, ever. Maybe once. And random new girl can read it without any trouble at all. 

The villain just said the same things over and over again. Just...ugh. &&There were Zombie sharks which was pretty awesome.&&Flintstones. He made the first great but the second one had some other guy and he would say similar catchphrases and it came off painful.&&The Gambler wasn't really a good movie and absolutely nothing special, but damn it all of the few scenes with John Goodman don't make that movie rewatchable.&&Honestly, he was probably sick of the role, and was only doing it for the check. I kinda get it.&&The last couple Pirates movies took all the fun out of the character. In the first 3, Jack was eccentric, but you always had a feeling that he was one step ahead of everybody. In the newer ones though, Jack is just a bumbling fool who gets out of every situation through dumb luck rather than his wit.&&I love Barbossa in all of them. Such a brilliant character! I love that he’s standing on the edge between good and evil.&&There is an inverse relationship between the amount we see of Jack Sparrow and the amount we like him. He's candy, or dessert. He sweetens the meal, but if the whole meal is a bowl of sugar, you get sick of it.&&This video https://youtu.be/zhdBNVY55oM (sorry for format, on mobile yada yada yada) really goes into a lot of detail on what made the first Pirates movie so great. It's REALLY long (almost an hour) but really worth it. Dude really likes the movie, and after watching his video, I feel like I appreciate a lot of things I didn't notice before. &&My favorite unofficial fan theory is that the entire Pirates’ story is being told by Mr. Gibbs in some tavern. The first one is well thought out and articulated. Then as time goes on and Gibbs gets progressively more and more drunk, the story gets crazier and crazier. The characters become really over-characterized and the plot becomes completely unbelievable. &&By the third one he was surrounded by characters with more depth and weren’t one note. I really wish they could have explored Elizabeth being the pirate king and Will being the new captain of Davy Jones’ ship but Keira Knightley left the franchise. If they’d taken that direction it would have been far more interesting. I’ve always hated how they wrote off her character at the end as if she’d just settle down with their kid and wait ten years for Will to be able to step on land. She wouldn’t do that. She’d be out there with him and their child on her own ship &&They say the protagonist in a story is the character with the most to lose, and Will Turner actually sort of fits that description a little better than Jack does, although the two are still lead roles together.

I think later films lost that, they seemed to think Jack Sparrow had to be front and centre of the film, but he actually works better as more of a supporting role, as he is in the first movie. As they attempted to explain more of his backstory in later films, he actually became less interesting and just kind of annoying I think. &&Yeah 100%. Jack sparrow was great because he would suddenly appear and steal the scene.

Like certain singers will always make songs better as a feature but I would never listen to their whole albums.&&What? The thing that made him great in the first one was that he was obviously not the lead and was never intended to be one.&&[removed]&&> the writers wrote him to be more and more ridiculous throughout the rest of the films, ruining the character.

https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization&&I thought he couldn't stop playing Jack Sparrow after the Pirates movie. But I suppose he couldn't stop playing that character while filming Pirates either.&&Basically he was unpredictable when he wasn't the main character.  With Will as the main character, you couldn't really tell if Jack was the hero or the villain.  When he became the main character he was very obviously the hero.&&Yeah it's like putting Kramer from Seinfeld into a series as a main character.

Those characters work as a breath of fresh air. When they're all you're breathing... not so much.

Another thing that helped Depp in Pirates is that Orlando Bloom (ostensibly the lead) is a fairly wooden actor. Unless you're just swooning over his looks, he's about as exciting as a bowl of oatmeal, so you're really primed for SOMETHING, ANYTHING interesting. *Enter Jack Sparrow.*&&Pirates of the Caribbean was an accidental masterpiece? The video you are talking about. I think the guy mention that exact same thing, but I could be wronf&&The first one made it a point to emphasize that nobody ever knew if it was cunning or dumb luck. A combination of both is perfect for the history of a pirate. Because they're legends and you never know how much is real anyway. 

But later installments showed it being more dumb luck than anything else and cheapened the character&&He's been doing that for years. &&lol that's like late career Marlon Brando levels of lazy&&That’s a lie. At least get your facts straight. Depp has been very open about for years having a mic feeding him sound effects and music and ambient stuff to get him in the moment. His characters are hugely pantomime, and he uses the material for emoting to them in the background. &&I mean, it’s also pretty clear that whether or not he’s doing it right now, for the past 3-4 years he’s been drinking really heavily (and I think he was always a big drinker). To the point that it rapidly aged him after a long period of apparent agelessness.&&Really? Kubrick?

Edit: apparently The Shining was not terribly popular when it first was released to audiences. Fans of the book were sorely disappointed after Kubrick took the story in another direction. The film didn't become appreciated until it was released on VHS.&&Seems odd to say it's almost all gone, it's invested in property and art...or has he somehow lost that?&&He came out and corrected that it was actually $5 million to shoot the Thompson cannon. He really wanted to set the record straight/brag I guess&&Does he still own the art and real estate?

Yeah, his spending is out of control, but he's not bankrupt or anything. If he ever calms down and wants to live a reasonable life, he has assets worth millions.&&How does it even cost that much to shoot something out of a cannon? &&In his defense, the rum was gone for some reason. What's he supposed to do?&&The Thing was a *huge* flop when it was first released. While E.T. was in theatres, no one was in the mood for a scary alien movie.

Come to think of it, several of John Carpenter's movies have bombed in theatres but gone on to become huge cult films. Big Trouble in Little China was one of the biggest box-office disasters of 1985.&&Some Razzie nominations look downright ridiculous in hindsight, I’d say most infamously the nomination for worst director at the first razzies in 1980 of... Stanley Kubrick for the Shining. &&The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly has a masterpiece of a score&&True, but parts of The Thing score can be heard in The Hateful Eight. Some scores have been disqualified from being nominated for similar situations, such as Johann Johannsson's *Arrival* score.&&I'm sure the 5th one, with an 80 year old Harrison Ford, will rectify this. It'll probably be set in the 70s and he'll be on the hunt for back pills and a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. &&""I am not a dragon but...""&&Teachers of reddit, what is your favorite part of your class that you love teaching?

Within that time, Dolph hits Stallone so hard in the chest, he puts him in hospital for at least 8 days, about 5 of those in ICU.

Basically, a real-life fight between those two probably would have been (was) very short and actually even surviving it would have been an issue, never mind winning it.

&&I must break you.&&That's being generous to Reagan and Gorbachev.&&Or an objectively better cut than a Philly cheese steak.

That having been said, I'm pretty sure Rocky Balboa came close to being as good as Rocky.&&I know we all like to joke about the montages in that film, but every single one of them had music that matched perfectly. &&You’re gonna be a montage! Even rocky had a montage!&&Well how else are you going to have a feature film when the cocaine runs out and you've only got 50 minutes of footage?&&1/3 montage, 1/3 boxing, 1/3 Paulie trying to fuck a robot.&&Ah hahaha what a film, Mark&&I honestly just realized that people are saying Rocky 4 was bad/lauded... In my mind I thought everyone was talking about Rocky V.  
  
Rocky V was such a big disappointment&&Clubber Lang was good, but Drago was a nightmare.  That motherfucker was terrifying.&&Is that the one with the robot friend??&&Rocky is slow. It’s a serious film.

Rocky II is trying to be a serious film, but isn’t as good as Rocky. But the fight is much better.

Rocky III is an action movie in boxing movie clothing. To me it’s the best Rocky even if it is a popcorn movie instead of a serious film.

Rocky IV is Rocky III with the fat cut out. Literally a series of montages, and better yet, music videos. Very good popcorn movie with no substance.

Rocky V was trying to be a serious film but the series had done too much action movie cocaine. It had a serious storyline where an opponent wasn’t really the plot. It was about Rocky finding himself again like in the first movie. And it sucked.

Rocky Balboa was Rocky realizing he was getting old and no one cared about him anymore and he liked the attention of going to the well of fame one more time. This one worked because it’s really about Sylvester Stallone (To be honest, Rocky III was about Stallone as well).

Creed is a straight remake of Rocky. And it was great. &&Rocky 1 is my favorite one, but it probably depends on your tolerance for camp. Rocky 4 is pretty goofy (Pauly had a robot butler bring him a birthday cake, for example), and a lot of people prefer the full on 80s cheese of it.&&He was the same. It feels unfair that he got nominated for a Razzie when he's one of the consistently good characters in KK. If anything, Thomas Ian Griffith would've been a better choice (love Terry Silver but he was a better Razzie contender than Mr. Miyagi).&&If it is a reference to the SNL sketch with Celebrity Jeopardy, that's a deep reference.&&[6:10, my dude.](https://youtu.be/Ch_hoYPPeGc)&&You're going to beat me?

https://youtu.be/U-7s_yeQuDg&&I don't understand why she got a razzie for that. She NAILED that crazy fuckin role. The movie was terrible, but it wasn't because of her. She was fantastic at what she was doing. &&She is a national treasure. She's come a long way since she was in ""The Bus that Couldn't Slow Down"".&&[deleted]&&It's amazing. Awful but amazing. 
A borderline disabled woman in her thirties (who has a job at a local paper writing crosswords) follows a man she met once across the country, falling down a giant hole, saving a three legged baby and meeting a guy who carves heads into apples along the way.
Pure bonkers&&Please elaborate lol&&Really disagree here.  The films even open with Will and Elizabeth.  Jack is either a side-plot that is going to become a main plot (because as others have said, Jack is supposed to be one step ahead of everyone, so generally whatever he's looking for is going to be the main focus later on) or something we're introduced to afterwards.  

Hell in At World's End Jack isn't even in the movie for a good chunk of it.  We follow Will and Elizabeth as they look for Jack, and even when they find Jack, the movie isn't *about* Jack, he's just another cog turning the plot just like Barbossa, Jones, Will, Elizabeth, the Pirate Lords, etc...

Now 4 and 5 definitely suffer from this.  Jack is the whole reason for the film.  Ugh.  Lame.  His character works best when we experience his actions through other characters.&&You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain &&I did too but I’m gonna throw out that what we got wasn’t *really* a movie about Han Solo, it was about the young man who becomes Han Solo. With Jack Sparrow we’re getting the exact same character.&&We just rented it the other night, my boyfriend and I both loved it. I don't understand the negative feedback at all. I thought it was really interesting and fun.&&I feel lots of the folks that hate on Solo are just bandwagoning and never saw it. It was actually a really solid stand alone star wars flick. It wasn't earth shattering but it was our first one that didn't really bother with rebels or rebellion. I really enjoyed it.&&It made a lot of money, and I gotta say, I didn't think it was that bad. I felt that it had that sense of adventure that the fourth lacked. IMO it was better than the second and fourth movies. &&And Paul McCartney was in jail. &&I hated that. Jack had a backstory (albeit not clearly explained in the main movie) from the very beginning that was way better.&&And Will Turner's son shoving his hand up Barbossa's daughter's dress as he caught her. Then towards the end of the movie they reminisce about it&&Gonna be honest all the pirates movies hold a place in my heart. However i have to agree with you. There were so many plot holes and things that couldnt have been possible in the last one. The more times I went through them all the worse it got.&&And Davey Jones is back. Or something.&&Really? His acting/character is what I liked most about the movie.

Unless you mean he should have been in an actually good movie, in which case I'd agree.&&You mean Jeffrey Dean Morgan?&&[deleted]&&Stole a bank? Not, like, robbed it but picked up the whole building and ran off with it?&&Only decent thing about that film was Javier Bordem playing a creepy dead pirate captain.&&wasn't the second one played by King Robert Baratheon?&&They went from John Goodman and Rick Moranis to Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin. &&Or... alcoholism.  He was going through some shit then. &&But then I think recently he also showed up playing that role at the actual ride for fun....he seems to like the character but probably is tired of the movies. &&I thought the same thing when I saw 2 and 3 - he becomes gradually more insane (or, we see inside his head) instead of the first movie where he seems lucky, but more cunning.&&https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization&&Porco Rosso, is that you?!&&I agree. In the first one Captain Jack Sparrow was maybe a bit high on something, but very confident strategist and skilled warrior. Two other movies gave him bit of a toon force and cranked his weirdness, but it was still Jack, the best-worst pirate you’ve ever heard of. Every shit he’d put himself into, he’d get out using his own wit and skills. In the last two movies, especially the recent one, every situation was resolved by a sheer luck and convenient coincidences. &&Absolutely spot on. I recently binged through all 5 of them. Pirates 1-3 showed a calculating man who's gone a but looney. Pirates 4 still retained some of that, he was still trying outsmart Blackbeard, there was still more goofiness than the last ones. Pirates 5 shit the bed.

For me it's in his eyes. In Pirates 1-4, you could still see the gears turning behind Jack's eyes. His eccentrics were a mask, something he used to get out of sticky situations or awkward conversations, but then as soon as people stopped paying attention to him, his eyes became narrow and lazer focused. In Pirates 5, he was just a glassy-eyed drunk. I suspect that has more to do with Johnny Depp's personal struggles than just the writing.&&The Homer Simpson Effect &&Barbossa never got tiring because Geoffrey Rush is frankly amazing.&&Possibly why he was better in the first trilogy. For the crap that Will and Elizabeth got sometimes, they were actually pretty good foils for Jack imo.&&Same with Dory of Nemo. &&Norrington x Jack Sparrow is my new favourite pairing. &&[deleted]&&Will and Elizabeth are the two leads of the original Pirates movies. One could even argue that Elizabeth's story is the A plot and Will's is the B plot. Jack has his own subplot, but his story is mostly in support of the first two. This is something that the studio, for some reason, did not understand.

And thus we got Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge...&&You are without doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of&&He couldn't stop playing Hunter S Thompson &&I read the til a while ago and he posts something like a million bucks for the service. &&People hated 2001 when it was released as well. Even Eyes Wide Shut I've been seeing more people coming around to it in recent years.&&[deleted]&&Well, once it's all invested in the art what do you buy new art with? Then you're just trading Monets like Pokemon cards to get your art fix&&Michael Jackson was also almost 'broke', except for his Beatles music catalog valued 450 million, artwork and several multi-million dollar properties. (I'm sure he had a lot more.) That poor thing!

&&[deleted]&&The problem with owning hundreds of millions in real estate and art is it’s not liquid. A guy like JD walks in and writes a cheque, he doesn’t negotiate down so he takes a shit deal.

&&By the time ET rolled around, people had been inundated with B movie rip offs of Alien for years. And let's be fair, with a modest crew of various working class or lower class white collar employees, trapped in an environment they can't get out of, facing an alien threat, and slowly falling apart, it is an Alien retread, but it is actually a good one. However, by the time it hit, audiences had gotten fatigued of those.&&Someone should award the Razzies a Razzie.&&I think Stephen King might have paid someone to nominate Kubrick.&&Absolutely. The Hateful Eight was given a pass because enough of its music was original (~50 minutes), and those were the bits nominated.

Rambo III.

Rambo

Rambo V (just started filming, name could very well change)&&[deleted]&&You’d have to watch Rambo 3 as well to catch all the references.&&Oh man that scene was amazing when he rises up behind the machine Gunner when hope was lost&&Supposedly it was like an act of rebellion to own that movie in Burma as it depicted atrocities carried out by the govt there. Remember Stallone saying Burmese people sent him pics of themselves with the movie, which was like a rebelious thing to do. Might have been on the DVD extras. &&That movie was great. It’s violent and brutal. Really good movie.&&Classic MacGruber&&Decent-ish?

I mean the last rambo was a great god damn movie with solid acting and amazing action. &&Decent-ish?! It's FUCKING AMAZING!!!&&Last time I saw Rambo was in 2014. It was a TV showing recorded on Betamax. The cereal and toy commercials were amazing!&&Now your just not very good, Will Hunting.&&Die Hard was about a plain old NY cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, barely staying alive.

And every episode after that, it gets closer and closer to James Bond, like shooting down a helicopter by launching a motorcycle into it, or driving a truck off an overpass and on top of traffic.&&It's not just an action movie. Die Hard is a Christmas movie.&&Please Lord, let Kevin Smith’s planned Jay and Silent Bob Get Rebooted actually happen, unlike Clerks 3 and Mallrats TV.  &&I didmt say at 3 i said at some point. 2 is bad 3 is good, 4 is decent and the one with the son was a giant piece of shit&&They should do another sequel where Rambo returns to Afghanistan without reading up on it first.&&The Bond movie The Living Daylights (1987) features the Mujahideen as good guys/allies, too, because they were resisting the Soviets.&&In part is the key word there. That's a common misconception that gets thrown around too much. The Mujahideen were made up of many different people and later after the war became many different factions, some joined the Taliban(which came five years after the war), joined other factions, or became shop owners or farmers and stopped fighting. A large number of volunteers for what became the Taliban came through the Muslim Brotherhood(which no, isn't exactly the Taliban either), and many other radically religious Arab factions.&&The police station escape, motorcycle ride, run through the mountain, jumping off the cliff sequence is action gold. &&It's like a slingshot. They are seeing how far down they can pull it before it gets launched to unseen levels of glory.

Or the band snaps and everyone involved gets an epic slap to the face.&&It's because the first two were fantastic, and they focused almost entirely on the chase. The villain was iconic, the heroes relatable. After that they got way too into the war, and the time travel nonsense. The exception being 3, which I thought was fine but suffered from from doing basically the same things the previous two already did.

The problem is that you can't keep having movies where it's just a monster chasing the same people for an hour and a half without turning into genre schlock.

Basically in the first two movies they told the most important stories, then rehashed them in the third one, then went hard trying to spool out whatever other stories the setting might have, but in doing so they completely changed everything about what made the original movies so simple and great.&&He was Over the Top in Rhinestone.

But if performances are the disease, Cobra is the cure. &&It actually says that it was heart swelling in the article. Lundgren hit him so hard his heart bounced against his thoracic cavity and swelled. &&And mind you, Dolph Lundgren has a masters degree in Chemistry and won a Fulbright Scholarship to MIT - but turned it down because he got hired as Grace Jone's bodyguard and then became her lover.

He was also a 2nd degree black belt by this time - so there's also that.&&My 2 favorite Rocky quotes are in the first ~10 minutes of Rocky 4.  It is obviously the superior Rocky. &&He is like a piece of iron.&&Gorbachev at least allowed the match to happen though, so he was part of the solution.&&Rocky Balboa was fantastic.  It was shockingly close to the original in quality.  Creed was also a suitable passing of the torch I think.  I fully expect Rocky to die in Creed 2.&&It was Rocky MTV. &&THERE'S NO EASY WAY OUT&&The original karate kid tournament ""you're the best...around"" montage just takes the cake for me.  It was banned in my house as a kid because we literally just started fake karate fighting as soon as we heard the music.

But the Russian vs rocky training sequence is pretty badass too&&^*montage*&&Yes. And the epic ""Hearts On Fire"" montage. &&Happy birthday, Paulie &&If you really assess the Rocky movies, from  the first to the last, that series has really stood up more than a lot of other franchises. I'd say at least I,  II, Balboa, and Creed are must-sees. And I'd still be happy recommending III and IV. V is the only one I'd say skip.&&What about Rock VII: Adrian's Revenge!&&Aren't they all about Stallone?

Rocky = an actor who isn't being recognised and just wants his shot.

Rocky II = actor becomes famous and wants to use this notoriety to do something different but keeps being drawn back to what made him famous in the first place.

Rocky III = actor has become world's biggest star but that doesn't equal critical success. He has his every move watched and critiqued and his falls are bigger. 

Rocky IIII = actor realises that sometimes politics are bigger than acting. 

Rocky V = actor is becoming too old to act the way he did (ironically). He needs to nurture someone new in his fashion. 

Rocky Balboa = actor is ready to show the world he can still do  it. 
&&On the montage scale, however, Rocky 4 wins in a landslide.&&This is one of my pet peeves with the Razzies. Their nominations tend to be based on who is the easiest to make fun of, not on actual bad acting. You get a lot of nominations like this where the person's acting was fine, but the Razzies just want to make fun of a disappointing movie. I know that the Razzies are meant to be a joke, but I wish they were better about actually choosing bad acting instead of going with the easiest targets.&&I LIKE THAT, JOHNNY. IM GONNA USE THAT. AHHHH HAAAAA&&I gave yer mother a deep referenshe lasht night Trebek!&&You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?&&Ya Jackass!&&Todd Howard has said he'll stop rereleasing Skyrim when people stop buying it.

This wasn't a joke, it was a plea.&&He does have a sweet soul, but it doesn't help him since he lacks the will to do good, since he spends literally all his energy avoiding doing bad.  That's why Chidi & Eleanor compliment each other -- Chidi's morality paralyses him without Eleanor's forcing action, while Eleanor's actions are selfish without Chidi's morality.

Jason and Tahani compliment each other similarly.  Jason is very kind to his friends, but doesn't consider the global or long-term consesquences of his actions, while Tahani's actions had positive global consequences, but she doesn't seem to have any caring personal relationships, not even with her family.&&She can take a joke. And the thing she does with her hair is sexy as fuck.&&You weren't at max level previously?&&I hadn't seen that one in a year or so, thanks for bringing it up. Truly took it with stride. Its been at least 8 years since I've seen Catwoman but good god that scene they showed at the beginning.  &&I like the symbolism in her Oscar in the context of the last part about taking a loss with dignity and praise with humility.&&She takes herself very seriously. I think it shows she didn’t take the movie seriously.&&The critics said they had no chemistry which Sandra referenced at the Rassies. ""They're no supposed to have chemistry. That's the whole point of the movie.""


Also you should watch it because it's funny and the supporting cast is good too.&&It's just very uncomfortable to watch. It's basically about a very socially awkward (to the point of being delayed by the way she portrays it) woman, played by Sandra Bullock. She has an obsession with a reporter, played by Bradley Cooper. She follows him everywhere he goes while simultaneously messing everything up by being weird and invasive. It's just a very strange film that doesn't really seem to have a point. &&I actually legitimately like it. The dialogue between the three male mains was really funny to me and while it's not the greatest movie, it's worth a watch.&&Sandra Bullock is absolutely fucking insane in that movie, but she’s framed as the good guy and stuff. I barely remember it, but she literally follows Bradley Cooper’s character across the country and through literal tornadoes just for the dick. I saw it with my girlfriend, don’t judge me. &&I feel like 2 and 3 are like The Defenders. Sure, there's a lot of Iron Fist. Maybe too much. But it's still way more about the others.&&Definitively felt like Star Wars. Made me feel a bit like the first movie, ya know &&Not to mention it introduced me to Kaya Scodelario, which I will be eternally grateful for😏&&It was ok. That’s all it doesn’t suck as most ppl make it out to be but it‘s also not as brilliant as the first ones. But it‘s clearly better than the 4th &&Paul McCartney in a Pirates movie?  Please tell me they gave him a peg leg. Please...&&Exactly! ""People aren't cargo, mate"" is possibly my favourite line in the franchise. &&Them shoehorning in the fountain of youth into 4 was bad enough and made little sense, but at least it didn't feel as crowbarred in as Depp suddenly having a ghost after him all these years, which makes no sense when you remember the plot of 2/3.&&Even though all of the world’s curses were broken with the trident thingy.&&He did Pirates of the Caribbean 5 based on getting to say the word [Jack Sparrow ](https://youtu.be/3KvSa7SqIMA) 50x in one movie with a [very thick Spanish accent ](https://youtu.be/ZSaP6DOglB8)&&Dragged it through town by horse.&&They meant to just drag the vault out with horses, but I guess it was bolted down really _really_ well.

The whole movie was just odd, like they had a sign in the writers' room that said ""NO BAD IDEAS"" in huge font, and they took it as ""no ideas are bad"". Just a mess, but not a total waste of time I guess.&&Gods he was strong then

Edit: no ""back""&&Yes! Viva Rock Vegas. Starring King Robert with Jenna Maroney and one of the lesser Baldwin brothers.&&WILMAAA! 

MORE.

WINE.&&> alcoholism.

*Method acting.&&Doesn't he spend tens of thousands of $s on wine a month? &&Also, in the first movie you got the feeling that he was mysterious, like you couldn't really understand him or his motivations, which gave a lingering sensation of Jack being a dangerous man. On the next ones, he basically spends half his screen time explaining his thoughts, his intentions and plans. 

That being said, one of my favorite action scenes of all time is the massive battle between the pirates and the British navy. I wish we had more movies with massive Ship of the Line era battleships. 

EDIT: Thanks to everyone telling me to watch Black Sails, it's already on my Netflix list. &&https://i.imgur.com/Y0lbvQP.gif&&Close, it’s known as Flanderisation&&And didn’t suffer from the writers devolving his character, but adding layers over time.&&This is it exactly. Once the films focused exclusively on Jack, everything wrong about him came more into focus. Will and Elizabeth were more reasonable, human people who added some grounding and balanced the Jack character.&&Same thing happened with that Joey spinoff from friends&&But you HAVE heard of him.&&Ok but that means he can still sell at a loss and have a lot of money&&That's a good point, plus taxes on all those properties that he's probably not renting out. I just hope we don't see Johnny also in trouble with the IRS in the future.&&Wow that's a serious year for great films&&The Thing is based on a short story from the 50's, which itself inspired Dan O'Bannons(Alien's screenwriter) writing in Alien (specifically the whole 'Isolated workers against an alien horror' part).
Interestingly, he worked on Carpenters first movie, Dark Star, and was inspired by the low production values to create a more ""real"" alien monster.  &&Well it's not my fault my friends have more exciting lives than I do&&Spoiler Alert: The Tesla wins.&&You may have played too much Street Fighter II growing up.&&she wouldn't even be able to hear the bell, that's savage.&&Rambo 5 should just be ""John"" to really mess with people&&Rambo V: The Expendables IV&&I hope they go with R5mbo&&>Rambo V (just started filming, name could very well change)

There's 20 books in total.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey–Maturin_series&&I've often wondered why it did so poorly and come to conclude it was TOO well done. People just don't care for an obsessively accurate period piece and prefer absurd, Disneyfied hijinks. Tragic as I adored it.&&As a piece of storytelling it's almost unmatched in my eyes, and as a book adaptation it was utterly flawless. It did everything right (well, in an ideal world it would have been a series, but they did miracles with a single film.)  it's so incredibly rare to see a film made by a director who loves and is in tune with the source material so much that deviating from the books did not feel unnatural or misjudged in any way. 

I'm surprised to see even a few people on Reddit acknowledging it, though. It did not get the credit or viewership it deserves.

The main thing is that it doesn't really pick one idea/genre and sticks with it, critics and the public don't like that. It is a mix of period drama, a character study, an action adventure and even some mystery. They tried to cram everything in one movie, while it would be better suited for a miniseries.

The other problem was with the movie was advertised. It was presented as an  action film, a swashbuckling tale of revenge. With Russel Crowe audiences expected the gladiator on the waves, they got a serious period correct drama with a lack of focus.&&I hated Master and Commander when I was 15.

So coming from a Colombian guy, I want these stupid fucking movies to stop. I also propose that Latinos find an infamous terrorist criminal that white people hate, like Timmy McVeigh or Osama bin Laden and make endless shows and movies about them and how cool they are and maybe then people will finally understand that Pablo Escobar was just a piece of shit at the end of the day.&&BLACKIE!&&That was Narcos' fault&&Would love to see it but my GF is Colombian and legit hates anything and everything about him but I'll probably watch it alone anyway&&They need to stop glorifying this shit altogether. 

Edit: grammar&&This.  Enough with romanticizing history's worst criminals.&&As a Colombian, we don't need more fucking escobar stories, we're kind of sick of being associated to this guy, given the fact it was 30 years ago. &&Tell me about it. As a Colombian is very frustrating. I always have to clarify to my American friends the following 

-It was NOTHING like Narcos 

-He was a monster,  a horrible psychopath who killed and tortured hundreds of people. He fueled the drug market in Colombia leaving millions of innocent people stranded in the middle of a terrible war that útil this day has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands and affected almost every person in the country. We all have to live with the stigma of cocaine trade everywhere we go. Decades of poverty, violence and exploitation, that his legacy, nothing more.

-He was considered a “Hero” by a very few people from “las comunas” (basically Medellin Favelas) the reason behind it is that he invested a lot of money in this poor and neglected areas with the intention of recruiting young people to expand his reign of terror. In the comunas he crafted a web of hired killers (as young as twelve years old) child prostitution, micro trafficking, cocaine kitchens and worst. His goal was to become a politician to avoid extradition that’s why he tried so hard to gain popularity among poor people. 

-99.9% of Colombians hate him... We don’t look up to him in any fucking way and it’s a dark and shameful part of our history.

-Every time I see his fucking face plastered in a T-shirt I feel sick. To see him being glorified by Hollywood and to read so many supportive comments is terrible. Just portraying him in a seemingly positive way is a huge disrespect for the victims and an immense proof of ignorance that’s beyond my understanding. There’s this narrative that basically turned him into an “antihero rebel” who cared for his people which cannot be farther from reality. 

-Netflix didn’t care that the wives, mothers, sons and daughters of the victims had to see this garbage of human being glorified in a show that was full of lies, where fiction was presented as reality. It really felt that they were using our pain for entertainment. 

&&What is this crazy fascination with Escobar? In general I feel like cartels and cartel bosses are being glamorized in Hollywood a little too much these days.&&God, that seems like really good casting. Javier Bardem can pick some real shit movies, but he usually manages a great performance out of it, hope he does well here&&Stop, just stop with the Escobar movies...Narcos did it best, Wagner Moura will forever be the only actor to do Escobar, we can now put the story to rest and stop with the movies.&&Wagner Moura's role as Pablo Escobar in Narcos was stellar. He practically robbed the show. You can tell by how season 3 struggled to find such a likeable yet despicable villain in the Gentlemen of Cali. His portrayal was spot on.

&&Um, by my count, 6 more?&&But we haven't gotten good Pablo Escobar movies yet, just the Narcos show and the Colombian novelas. So I hope this movie is great. &&I wouldn't even bother after Narcos came out... how are you going to tell that story better than Narcos did?!?!?&&The Expendables: Starring Pablo Escobar and Al Capone.&&Just be glad you're not German.&&Narcos moved on from Escobar and moved to the new cartel which was an interesting spin. &&also seems weird that they can never get a colombian to play him&&I think us mexicans are in for a few decades of every movie being about narcos or day of the dead&&Are you saying we must let the past die? :\^)&&As someone who used to work in tourism in Colombia, I'm tired of how many travel stories mention Escobar in their first sentence, eg, ""The Medellin portrayed in Narcos is no longer Pable Escobar's stronghold, it's a festive, modern city with great museums and better public transportation!"" 

F***ing kill me now. Once or twice, it doesn't sound that bad, but it's how 90% of all travel articles and blogs about Colombia start these days. So what? Once upon a time, Colombia had a world-class gangster, and he got shot. Colombia still has amazing beaches, a hot springs waterfall, Villa de Leyva, Cartagena, San Agustín archaeological park, whitewater rafting in the Amazon, arepas etc etc etc.... but 99% of potential tourists have no idea about any of that. They hear ""Colombia"" and think ""Pablo Escobar."" We're cheating ourselves by watching yet another drama about one dead criminal. &&They need a new bad guy to glamorize since the mafia has basically been decimated worldwide. &&And yet Griselda Blanco’s story hasn’t been touched by Hollywood &&He's like the Colombian Ip Man&&He's like Che Guevara or any other anti hero that people latch on to without understanding the person.  They romanticize some rebellious icon that appeals to taking some control back in their lives and rally around the image with tribal frenzy.  

People want to feel in control, they want to ""rage against the machine"", and be part of something different than ""everyone else"".  Thus we create these false idols.  

Well that was iam14andthisisdeep.  I'll stop before I grow a fedora out of my head.&&I went to Colombia a few years ago and loved it, but I found it fascinating how Colombians, especially people in Medellin, dealt with the past. There was definitely a lot of ""let's move on and not talk about it."" 

An old man yelled at our tour guide for telling us about that bomb in the bird statue because he thought it would scare us away from Colombia or think that we weren't safe. The tour guide was talking about how it's important not to bury history, even if it's ugly.

It was interesting to contrast it with my experience touring around Berlin. 

The Germans method is: ""we have the nastiest history, so we are going to put it on display so we never forget what can happen if we lose our minds.""

The Colombian method was more like: ""we finally got over this terrible period, we're ok now, let's move past it and forget about it.""

It makes perfect sense that they would feel strongly about an actor romanticizing Pablo&&This is exactly my thought - they stretched the whole story over two season at 10 episodes each with a runtime of somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes. 

No way you can show it as detailed in a two hour movie. &&Not only that, but Narcos' integration of Spanish and English speaking was so well done.  It's weird as fuck now to see the trailer with everyone speaking English, even the Columbians.&&But Narcos was like a ‘loosely inspired by a true story’ type thing. Maybe this one will be more biologist.

Edit: I’m keeping my ‘biopic-ish’ typo.&&And narcos also did a good job at displaying escobar as scum. At the end I was really hating him.&&You should watch ESPN's 30 for 30 ""The 2 Escobars"" documentary&&Dude from Narcos killed it everyone else should kick rocks.&&I always thought that they would Re release it with a different edit and it would be HUGE.

At the end of the screening episode the guy who's basically supposed to be Harvey Weinstein says 'there's genius in this', and theres a worker that makes a similar comment that Billy is fucking the movie up with the edit he's cutting.

&&I'll buy it for $1&&Are you saying they should just quit Medellin with the formula?&&no, but realistically portraying the horrors he inflicted on the people around him might. &&[deleted]&&I think they mean ""don't gloss over the brutality.""

Something I liked about Black Mass was how they showed the cruelty of the mob. As much as I love movies like Goodfellas and Casino (and I do love those movies), they really emphasize the ""glamour"" of being a mobster and the despicable,  disgusting things that were done are an afterthought.

I think the Colombian people just don't want another movie where the violence is a car bomb or a drug dealer getting shot. 

Don't gloss over the family that grieved because their 10 year old disappeared or the bright, promising teenager who was tortured and killed because he talked to police. Don't overlook the teacher or nurse who were killed by a bomb meant for someone else.

Escobar's lifestyle was glamorous, as long as you ignore the terrible things he did to maintain it. And it was a nightmare for everyone else.&&We don't have the same concept of glamorous then. A Harley with gold parts? So classy.&&Except it really wasn't. In the beginning, sure, he had a zoo! But then he would mostly hide in safe houses and be on the run.&&Showing the character without glamor is different from not showing a glamorous lifestyle. A good filmmaker should be able to show the lavish lifestyle and have your skin crawl at the same time.

I think what's meant here is ""without sympathy or glorifying him.""&&""This Valentine's Day Pablo Escobar takes a break from being a violent drug Lord to serve ice cream and find love in Pablo's Day Out""&&This whole time I thought this was a movie that they were working on, that wasnt out yet. &&Possibly because Pablo wasn't glamorous enough. &&Man, I thought you might just be crazy. I thought *how could Javier Bardem be in a terrible movie?*

Then I Googled lol.&&What could it even do differently that the other Pablo stuff before it hasn't already done? I have zero interest in seeing this. &&You could, y'know, accurately portray how vile, disgusting, and evil the actions of these guys were instead of framing them as tragic antiheroes.&&lol the US makes movies about white mafia kingpins all the time and we love them.&&I was with you until you turned it racial... I really don't see your point with that angle. criminals white people hate? There's been tons of movies about white drug lords in the US, mob movies WAY outnumber the Escobar films, and those do the same thing. Glorify the criminal lifestyle and senseless murdering. I for one am tired of the race card being played when there's a simple explanation. 

I get the frustration, there's way too many Escobar films, and he's a terrorist piece of trash. When he helped the people it was only because that helped him to have citizens on his side at the time, not because he was some hero who cared. he was a psychopath and deep down psychopaths care for no one but themselves. 

but it's being done so many times because people eat this shit up. Just like with all other crime/mob films. It's a money grab, it doesn't have to do with race. &&Hiding in caves is a lot less glamorous than being a gangster. Just look at all the movies made about mobsters in America (or people's love of ""OG"" rap), it's not like the ones Escobar are just because of insensitivity. I get where you're coming from, but as the somewhat ""peak"" of the gangster/mobster lifestyle, it's obvious that he's going to be a popular subject for movies.&&I think it would be impossible in the US for McVeigh to be a sympathetic character.  And bin Laden, forget about it.  But I get where you're coming from.  I'm fascinated by true crime personally but I rarely, if ever,  see the perpetrators as even close to empathetic.

&#x200B;&&The microtrafficing part is exaggerated we didn't have a drug abuse problem in those years, it started around 2000's&&I'm guessing that's it's joke about the Netflix original ""Narcos"". The actor who plays Escobar adjust his pants pretty often. I always thought it was weird so I think that's what they meant. 
 &&In the TV show Narcos Pablo adjusts his pants almost every time he’s on screen. It’s become somewhat of a joke among fans. &&[It was a very common thing in Narcos](https://youtu.be/ct_jq_2huJo)&&No true. I think it's something got to do with having a bulging belly so you pants keep adjusting to contain the flabs. I used to do it too when I was heaviest in my past life (235lbs). It was just natural.lol. 

Us fat people can totally relate to other fat people.&&Wagner Moura plays Pablo Escobar in the Netflix show Narcos. It’s very common to see him adjusting his pants in a scene.&&I’m assuming OP is talking about the portrayal of Escobar in the first two seasons of Narcos. In the show, Escobar had a tendency to adjust his pants, especially in scenes where his attitude changes or the emotion in the scene shifts.&&This guy gets it
https://youtu.be/H-0XlpIBTgs&&Dang it... I wanna laugh...&&You'll fucking die&&Holy shit. I never even knew that javier bardem was no country for old men guy. And im a huge fan of his. Dont ask me how i didnt realize that, but its definitly because of the haircut.. somehow.    
     

If you like woody allen movies vicky christina barcelona is a good one&&That's two haircuts...&&Tbh a little disappointed when I opened this up and it wasn't his OUTRAGEOUS cut from The Counselor&&The way his hair moves in the first one is unsettling&&Have you seen Bale as Dick Cheney? 

To put that side by side with his character in the Machinist is... I dunno, shocking seems to light a word.&&I feel like Bale isn't in control of any aspect of his personal appearance. &&Isn't Sherlock Holmes in more movies than any other fictional character? I love how he resonates through the decades like Dracula, Frankenstein (the monster) and others. &&Well played.&&Has there ever actually been a good movie about King Arthur? Aside from Monty Python of course.&&This is exactly like how they're remaking Vin's classic, Aquaman. &&Better bring the Entourage, Vinnie. &&Vinny Chase?&&VICTORY!!!&&Medellín...&&When they made the trailer in the show, I really wanted HBO to make the movie, but they would have to credit him as ""Adrian Grenier as Vincent Chase as Pablo Escobar""

That would have been a better Entourage movie than the Entourage movie.

Edit: then again, Medellin flopped ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯&&:( my favorite movie I’ll never see&&The arc of him being a decent human like with “the Mexican” killing the dog and his treatment of people all the way to his slip into paranoia and insanity was so well done. It helped that the real Steve and Javier has a lot to do with the production. 

Edit: Im not sure if anyone else felt the same way, but I saw the real change in him in that series when he was run out of the Colombian congress.  It was like he genuinely cared and wanted to help Colombia and then felt that the country turned his back on him.  &&You should watch Pablo Escobar:El patron del mal
It's way better imo. Should be on Netflix aswell&&Even better is Escobar: El Patrón del Mal made in Colombia by Colombians&&Just read Kings of Cocaine and Killing Pablo.  Narcos took a lot of artistic liberties.  &&Or Escobar, El patrón del mal, which is a more accurate and complete representation of Escobar.&&They made him too likable. In real life he wasn´t a family man and a good father. He was a total scumbag who for example LOVED to rape young virgin girls. There was a steady stream of young girls delivered to Pablo.&&Just to give people an idea of how much of PoS this guy was, Colombia back on the 80s and early 90s was very similar (safety-wise) as some countries of the Middle East today. Bombs were going off everywhere all the time in Bogota. It was literally normal to have the windows of your house/ appartment blown up.

This is the bomb he ordered on the DAS, basically the equivalent of the Department of Homeland Security in the US:

This is the wereckage of the Avianca Flight he ordered destroyed as a presidential candidate was going to fly in it. [That presidential candidate learned about the bomb, ended up not boarding the plane because of it, and he did not tell anyone else about the bomb. He later became the next president of Colombia after letting over 100 people be murdered in the flight:](https://noticias.caracoltv.com/colombia/hace-25-anos-fue-atentado-contra-avion-de-avianca-ordenado-por-pablo-escobar)
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fRSJlsOKoC8/UKzXAGXGfaI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/QMWC7rsHc8I/s1600/bomba+avianca.jpg

This was the bomb he ordered on Colombia's second biggest newspaper and the only one to oppose him and expose who he really was after he became a congressman in Colombia:

EDIT: Since there are so many idiots in this world that defend Gaviria as someone not knowing of the bomb, I added a source. He literally did not board the plane because of ""security concerns"" which were ""gossips"" his security team and himself were made aware of regarding a possible bomb in the airplane, which surprise, happened and he did not tell anyone about... The guy is a murderer too. He is responsible for the deaths of those 100+ people. He himself could have saved them, but decided to let them die.&&I don't feel Narcos idolizes him so much. Their story is his decent into national terrorism.&&Which makes me wonder when Hollywood’s going to start churning out Bin Laden biopics. &&I thought American Made with Tom Cruise was pretty legit&&More like the extendables&&Pablo Escobar 2020: Bitcoin or plomo&&Why?  What happened in Germany that people can't stop bringing it up since 1945?&&Damn… yeah, that must be a little annoying too.

But at least people *know* that Germany is no longer the same country as it was in the 40's.

All these films and tv shows do is paint an image of Colombia that just isn't true anymore. Pablo Escobar died 24 years ago and things have changed a lot since then. Yet his films still keep perpetuating the image of the civil war torn shithole. Now we're just a regular shithole.&&The difference being that every movie about Hitler doesn't also hint at the suggestion that he was 'bad-ass' or cool.

Every movie about Escobar is trying to do some Scorsese type humanizing of what was essentially a giant piece of human shit.

At least I haven't seen anyone trying to humanize Hitler, I dont doubt that there exists a movie like that, but all the ones I've seen he is a comically evil joke...as it should be.

&&I tried watching it and it just lost the magic that made me crave more. I know these cartels do crazy shit too but the acting of Escobar was just so damn good, they really made us feel bad for him at certain points &&Take the compliment. There's apparently no one who's half-balding and moderately overweight in the entire country.&&Well Andres Parra, a Colombian actor, played him in a Colombian series called Escobar: el patrón del mal, but that was like 5 years ago? Now there are like 4 Escobar’s&&Check out the colombian series ""El Patrón Del Mal""&&2020s will be nothing but Chapo and La Barbie movies lol&&Breaking Bad? Sicarios? It's already happening.&&Kill it, if you have to&&>Once upon a time, Colombia had a world-class gangster

I believe Pablo was THE biggest gangster in history/world that wasn't a politician/king/dictator. That is a big thing when America and a lot of the world romanticize gangsters. It sucks but that is just the way it is. &&There was a Lifetime movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones this year and an HBO movie with Jennifer Lopez supposedly next year. Not saying it's a huge release, but those are big names.&&What? Pablo isn't an idol or an anti-hero, he's straight up a monster. &&Idiot at my job, ""yeah man he did so much good for the town he lived in.""

Asshole, he did it because he wanted to bribe them. He so much fucking monsterous shit as well. You can't just wash it just because him being a ""drug dealer"" is cool. No, he wasn't rebelling against the government, he was just a straight up monster.&&The second season's plot was a bit too stretched out for my taste&&Colombians* I hate you <3&&I’m gonna need a full genetic and physiological breakdown of Pablo Escobar for this movie to be worthwhile now.&&Yeah but then you've got fuckwits wearing Pablo Escobar t-shirts and going to Medellin on Escobar themed holidays.

Not everyone took the same thing away from that show is what I'm saying. &&Bardem is a great actor. I think he will do just fine. I agree that the story of Pablo has been done too much recently. &&Dude from Narcos is Wagner Moura. Best Brazilian actor! His Spanish is atrocious though (no, Brazilians don't speak Spanish natively).&&Wagner Moura is an amazing actor, it doesn't matter what he does.&&You clearly haven't seen ""Pablo Escobar: El Patrón Del Mal"" Best Escobar series ever, the actors and actresses were the best honestly.&&No he didn't; his accent was terrible. You could definitely tell that he was Brazilian by the way he spoke. I guess its not a big deal to people that don't speak Spanish, but it was really jarring for native speakers.&&Thats cuz Billy would never let the fucking suits mess with his art. &&/r/unexpectedoffice&&We like to see what it's like without actually participating.&&In narcos he always came across as a monster. Yes he gained much materially and power. But ultimately he lost everything due to it as well. I don't see where it went out of it's way to over glamorize his life. &&I think it helps to showcase glamor alongside the horrible things that made it happen. Like the end of the movie Sicario, when you see the cartel boss with his family eating dinner in their lavish villa, and then see the consequences that lifestyle brought about.&&Hitler was really a Stegosaurus, hence why he was a vegetarian.&&You have my attention, would you mind expanding on that story, i'd like to hear&&You really need to rewatch Goodfellas and Casino if you think it's all ""glamour"" and they gloss over the bad shit.

Goodfellas: beat the shit out of Billy Bats, find him alive in the trunk of the car and Tommy stabs him repeatedly with his mother's kitchen knife and then he's shot a couple times. Everyone involved in the Lufthansa heist is murdered, Morry takes an ice pick to the back of the head. Tommy gets shot in the head for Billy Bats' murder. Henry and Karen look like shit all strung out on coke and have to turn informant to avoid being murdered. ""Among the Italians it was real greaseball stuff.""

Casino: Did you miss the last ten minutes of the movie? Everyone is murdered, Nikki and his brother get beaten close to death with baseball bats and are buried alive in a cornfield. Not to mention sticking a guy's head in a vice until his eye pops out, then slitting his throat. The constant fighting between Ace and Ginger. Smashing a cheaters hand with a hammer. The woman who claimed to be Green's partner getting shot in the head to shut her up.

These movies might show some glamour early on but they're ultimately about the downfall of all the characters,  and none of that is glamorous. &&That's what I said when I watched it!

Penelope Cruz! Bardem, oh this is gonna be great.  

&#x200B;

any second now this is going to get good

&#x200B;

any scene now, we are off to the races

&#x200B;

man I cant wait for these actors to come alive

&#x200B;

jesus christ just kill me now&&But if you're framing it as accurately as possible, you're inevitably going to have to make them cool, because even though they were horrible, they were still cool. (As in suave, composed)&&It's also an accurate representation. Pablo did this often. &&At first I thought it was odd, but then I tried to keep track of how often I adjust my pants during a day. Now it seems normal.&&I grew up in Venezuela in the early 90s and my Dad's family  who where business people working of always wear the same pants and shorts would always adjust them while getting up each time.&&Gotta get those big Ole balls comfy&&As a fat guy, adjusting your pants is part of life. It's very true to the character lol.&&Well, TIL I have the same body shape as Escobar. 

Maybe I should sell drugs.&&like the picard maneuver &&Lol I remember him doing it and thinking it was cool tick to add to a character but holy shit I had no idea he did it so much. Apparently he was basically just walking around constantly adjusting his pants the entire series. &&Si patron&&He does say malparido alot 😬&&What is he saying?&&You didn’t recognize him because he’s a great actor. Friendo. &&I remember renting Vicky Christina Barcelona from Blockbuster with my college girlfriend and having the most ravenous sex on her roommate's bed after. I will always love that movie.&&What if you don't like woody allen?&&So is Midnight in Paris. But Javier isn’t in that one.&&You didn't recognize him in literally his most acclaimed role which he is known for?&&I can't see him and not think about No Country For Old Men. That was fantastic.

Edit: But I can't see Brolin without thinking about Goonies.&&Or if you like ScarJo or Penelope Cruz ... there’s lots of reasons to like that film!&&Also Skyfall and The Counselor. Both great movies.&&How the hell are you a ""huge fan"" of his but don't know his most popular movie?&&Exactly. &&One look?!&&Never saw the movie but saw the hair and was thinking “oh he’s gonna put on his best performance “&&Or his voice. Dude's English accent is so bizarre now.&&The sword in the stone &&I remember really enjoying “Excalibur”, but it’s been about 10 years since I’ve last seen it. &&I remember enjoying the Merlin miniseries with Sam Neill on NBC as a young teen, but I'm sure it's trash now.&&Excalibur. &&The Merlin telemovie miniseries staring Sam Neil is terrific. One of the best modern adaptations I’ve seen. &&No, because there is no concrete myth about it. Everyone knows: Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin, Lancelot, something something Sword Stone, Lady of the Lake, Round Table, King Of England, something something Dragon, something something medieval fantasy.

No-one knows any of the specific narratives (partly because the source material is so shaky on the subject), and it's exactly why there hasn't been a good, authentic Robin Hood movie either (Merry Men, Nottingham Forest, Sheriff of Nottingham, Rich -> poor, something something archery, thievery, Maid Marion). Compared to Batman and Spiderman, the two most popular contemporary myths, where everyone knows the origin stories and relationships of them, several key side characters, the main antagonists and their side characters, these are myths where people know the Title, but that's the extent of their investment. Doubly so because the source of what little common understanding there is - the existing movies - play around with the canon because there is no canon and so noone ever solidifies The Story in their minds. The general public is never excited for a King Arthur or Robin Hood movie because those are only names they recognise, not narratives they know they love. &&*I am Queen's Boulevard...*&&Man, I really want Adrian Grenier to cameo in Aquaman. Would make the movie a 10/10 for me. &&Imagine James Cameron actually directing an Aquaman movie. &&**E:** Oh no, Vince stubbed his toe *looks like the movies off!*

**Turtle:** Wait he got better!

**Vince:** We're back on top, boys!&&Ooh yeaaahh, ooh yeaaahh ^ooh ^yeaaahh&&Lets hug it out, bitch&&You kidding?

I am Queens Boulevard &&Medellin flopped because the director/writer that was friends with them wouldn't compromise his artistic vision for entertainment.&&Wagner Moura killed that role man. He really was able to pour emotions out through the screen, especially Pablo's anger and paranoia as he felt the trap closing around him

Edit: Since I apparently have to clarify, I realize the accents and nationalities were not as they should have been on the show. I was referring to the acting and emotionality itself, not his accent. &&Agree.  Those two guys did/do a speaking tour which I got to see last year.  It was great and they talked about how much was real vs tv drama - I think they put it at 50/50 if I remember correctly.  &&Doing a better Escobar movie/ series than narcos is probably up there with topping Heath ledger as the joker. Like it *could* be done but it would have to be absolutely mind blowing to even come close.&&To me, it never seemed like he genuinely cared nor wanted to help Colombia. It seemed like he wanted people to look at him like he cared, raise him and keep him at the highest pedestal possible. When they didn't, he was like ""well fuck you then, I never liked you anyway""... even though he never did to begin with. The kind of a basic selfish dick behaviour. &&Huh, they used the real names of the DEA agents. &&He probably felt belittled too when he got kicked out, like he was not good enough to be a public servant and his ego couldn't handle that. Given how everything turned out, hindsight 20/20: it might just have been better if they let him stay in office.&&I've read lots of biographies on Pablo. I, and most Pablo experts, believe that's exactly what happened. He also went from being under the radar to being the public face Colombia began going after for the drug trade to appease the US. It's really when everything went to shit and he lost his grip on the drug monopoly as well.&&It is on Australian Netflix but I think the problem is that it comes off like a cheap telenovela. Even if narcos lacks authenticity, it has far better production value, pacing and acting.&&I tried to watch it but it's too ""telenovela"" for my taste.&&So Canadians?&&His brothers book ""The accountant"" is the best one imo.&&Not to mention he bombed and attacked the building holding all the evidence against him, the equivalent of our supreme court building.&&> That presidential candidate learned about the bomb, ended up not boarding the plane because of it, and he did not tell anyone else about the bomb.

Yeah, you got a source for that? Because that doesn't make any sense at all.&&Gaviria was scheduled for the flight.  Your assertion he knew of the bomb and did not prevent it, instead allowing innocents to perish, is as far as I know entirely unfounded, and frankly inconsistent with history. &&One of my early childhood memories is my family frantically calling each other whenever we heard a bomb went off... I hate that this guy keeps getting glorified in the US. If you wanna glorify terrorists do it to the ones that have hurt your own country and see how it feels. Let’s have a Netflix Osama Bin Laden series where he ends up being called a cool badass, and when you go to several tourist shops his face is planted on t shirts that make him look cool, let’s do that instead. &&Holy fuck &&Source on the bit of gaviria knowing about the plane bomb and not warning the other passengers? I know it happened in Narcos but id like some proof of it lol.&&Say hello to my extended little friend!!&&Something about a dude with a funny mustache &&> Damn… yeah, that must be a little annoying too.

> films still keep perpetuating the image of the civil war torn shithole. 


Same thing seems to happen with the vast majority of Africa. If you have movies tell it. There is only civil war/ famine and people living in huts&&>But at least people *know* that Germany is no longer the same country as it was in the 40's.

You'd be surprised how many people don't...
&&Progress! &&You can humanize a villan without glamorizing them. &&I would say Downfall humanized him but they didn’t glamorize him. &&It was the lack of Boyd Holbrook’s narration for me. His almost nonchalant speech pattern along with his voice and accent added to that magical realism theme &&I actually thought the last season, the one focusing on the cali cartel was the best season yet. The amount of tension throughout the entire season was nuts. A much better and layered story than just Escobar nonsense.&&*and who can act&&I visited Colombia back in April.

The only people who are obese in decent enough numbers are the middle aged and elderly. Young fat people exist but it's NOTHING like the US.

Oh and if you are very obviously a foreigner (you have light eyes and light hair, like me), girls will make it very clear that they are interested. I got more attention from doing absolutely nothing in a single day than I did here in the US in a year. Didn't matter if I was on a bus or walking down a street or buying a drink at a store. Everywhere I went there was occasionally a girl blatantly eyeing me. And they were only the ones that I noticed. Oh and the girls that I get attention from were WAY more attractive than what we have in the US. Not even comparable.&&I’ve seen a lot of r/prequelmemes leaks but this is the first r/sequelmemes leak I’ve caught in the wild.&&He actually was a politician for a little while haha &&What happened to Catherine Zeta-Jones? She just, sort of disappeared, and now she's doing Lifetime movies?&&The first and second seasons were intentionally an entirely different tone. The first season included *years* of early build-up to both introduce the characters, but also show the height of Pablo's power. The second season was very much a character-driven story to show his downfall into nothingness. I do agree it was a bit stretched, but I think the show did a good job showing two completely different angles of the same scenario.&& I preferred the final season. &&Could always make another Spider-Man origins movie. Haven’t had enough of those recently.&&I watched Narcos with my Argentinian friend who found his accent endlessly amusing.  He *really* loved the super-abbreviated way Moura sometimes says ‘hijo de puta’ (son of a bitch) for whatever reason.&&Native spanish speaker here. Yeah his accent wasn't perfect, but he did such a great job acting that I forgot about it mostly.&&I mean, at the risk of sounding ignorant, Netflix’s target audience with this show was not Colombians or South Americans in general: It was English speaking Americans. And of course to us we can’t tell the difference very well and he certainly did a great job with his overall delivery aside from the way he sounds. &&From medellin here, accent didn't even put me off considering how good of an actor he was playing the role. Sure it sounded a bit off but I was able to brush that aside most of the time.&&Same with that new Van Gogh movie. Everyone speaks fucking English and they didn't even bother to pronounce Vincents name the Dutch way.&&I can understand that criticism, but let’s be real though, that show was intended for a primarily English speaking audience that would never notice something like that.

If you can look past the accent, he did an amazing job in the role. He absolutely killed it.&&This is what I hear. Ignorance is bliss. But I have the same feeling with the korean spoken in black panther. It was cringey for me. The korean grandma working at the fish market isn’t a native speaker (she’s either not korean or she was born and raised somewhere outside of korea).

Edit: also like to add that it took place in Busan, South Korea. Busan has a specific dialect and accent. They didn’t get that right, either. The actress was trying to speak like someone from Seoul, but it was pretty bad. &&bad accent or not, he still played the role really well. &&Eh I think that's a bit nit-picky if you consider that the series is aimed at international audiences.

I can imagine that it is a really hard line to walk if you want to cast for stuff like that. Unless the stars align for you, you will either have to cast someone local who has the accent but isn't on par talent-wise as others or you cast the ""foreigner"" who'll get shit for the accent no matter how good it is but obviously is the better talent. 

And I don't how well or bad the Narcos dude did because I'm not south American and also my Spanish is limited to what I didn't forget in school but in my eyes they found a great balance.

If a movie/series has bits of non-english languages I think the natives should be happy enough if it is spoken correctly and without any ridiculous accent. Seeing how german or Nordic languages are represented sometimes makes me wanna puke.&&I don't speak spanish and I couldnt tell. Im also probably in the majority for the likely audience of that show. &&meu espanhol é perfeito. Não sei do que falas&&Yeah, when you're relying on subtitles that's not an issue. I thought the characters were really well done,  and I really respected the fact that even though they made it for a largely English-speaking audience,  they still had most of the dialogue in Spanish. 

Slightly related: I had no idea ""mierda"" was such a versatile curse word until this show! Lol&&He never stopped letting it percolate &&Or in Narcos itself. You see Pablo build up this empire and he seems like this super cool guy, but then he starts getting more and more evil and starts going crazy only to end up on the run and gunned down and photographed like he’s a trophy kill.&&Yes, that scene makes a perfect point.&&Also Stegosauruses famously loved dogs.&&Damn....lol I hate that feeling. I watched Mother! recently for the same reason ( Bardem , Lawrence ) and got the same thing in the end.

&#x200B;

It wasn't so bad, just waited too long to get things going and it never did.&&And they spell million with a b. That’s as cool as it gets. &&Not that I'm doubting you, but do you have a source?&&It’s what guys with guts do. I would know. &&I wear a belt and i still adjust my pants every time i bend over or crouch&&Escoballs&&Yep. As someone who spent most of his life with a body like Pablo's, the pants adjusting was the most authentic part of the whole damn show.

I was only a young teen when he was on top of the world, but from what I remember to Narcos, he was almost indistinguishable.  &&The slow decline into paranoia, especially the final showdown was so fucking intense. Especially when they started showing the original pictures of his dead body, the previous scene replayed in my head so much more intensely. &&I went to one of those! They said 1/3 was absolutely true, 1/3 was true but with a little/a lot of Hollywood mixed in and the last 1/3 was total bullshit.&&Casting Bardem is an excellent start. (And I agree - Narcos was uncanny.)&&Except every Colombian person hates when he speaks.

People may find themselves rooting for the protagonist but they eventually realise how evil a selfish, motivated individual can become.&&American here... I'm sick of it, too. Escobar was a psycho and deserves to have his name and reputation dragged through the mud, not glamorized by Hollywood. 

Even today, drug users don't seem to realize what they're supporting. Some yuppie snorting coke on the weekend in a bathroom bar doesn't _really_ understand that they're supporting the cartels, or what they're enabling. I read about a video of some cartel members casually peeling off a victim's face using a box cutter while Funky Town played in the background... Funded by weekend warriors in America.&&Oh. Don't you worry. The ironic veneration I'm sure is coming soon&&I remember that too. It is a bit sick that even in Medellin there's people who worship them.

Same with the idea of making Universidad Nacional a communist iconic place. No, make it dedicated to academia and nothing more. Yes, extreme capitalism sucks, but communism sucks even more and nothing  good has ever came from the FARC.&&That was roughly 30 years ago though. The country has changed massively since then. It's still relatively poor and unsafe, but not at civil war anymore. I live in Bogota and the only thing I absolutely *hate* about it is traffic. I've never been mugged or robbed or anything either, so it's improved massively since Escobar's time from what I hear.&&OwO&&Bitch, I got extendos. &&I love Charlie Chaplin &&I don’t get it, why don’t you guys like my Charles Chaplin mustache?&&I've traveled to both Germany and Colombia and there is definitely a very different response when you tell some one you are going to one versus the other. &&What kind of people would think that?

&&Definitely right. That was one hell of a voiceover, and it’s hard to articulate exactly why. I think you’re pretty close though.&&Really? I hated the season 1/2 narration and Pablo's actor hahaha.

I thought there was a real obvious drop in the quality of the writing, with cheesy lines and moments that broke the tone of the show.

My stepfather is Uruguayan and indeed speaks with some contractions, ""mijo"" (Mi hijo) is so common that projects itself beyond slang. They also speak much faster than their European counterparts and to some degree Mexicans.

The problem is that Wagner Moura tried to mimic this and he didn't even spoke Spanish before the series, which resulted in a ""Portupanish"" at best. Basically saying a mix of spanish and portuguese, but **really fast.**

&#x200B;&&Same. Moura was really good. &&Not ignorant it's the truth.&&In all fairness, native English speakers have no chance of pronouncing a Dutch g&&This is something I've always puzzled over. If you're making a movie for an English-speaking audience, portraying non-English speakers as if they were speaking English, does having them speak in an accent actually add any authenticity to it?

My general feeling is no. But I also don't like the trope of having characters in any historical period, and in any fictional fantasy world, speak with British accents.&&Can confirm. English speaker, never once noticed it. Didn’t even know it was a thing until I came into this thread&&Lupita Nyong'o spoke better Korean than the random Asian they cast as that Korean woman.   &&It's just weird, like there are millions of people that can fill these roles and speak the language well, why do we need to insert someone else without native fluency?  &&Oh, really? I saw the movie in Korea, and the whole audience seemed to find that scene hilarious, and I wasn't sure why. I guess now I know.

How hard could it have been to find a Korean actor when filming in Korea?&&Lmao ..as an African I felt the same way about all the actors speaking with the fake African accent ...cringing through out the whole movie. Still loved it tho. 

Edit: added accent &&Yeah, that show very clearly captured how pathetic Escobar’s end was despite the huge empire he had built up for himself. &&I liked that they never really hid the brutality of what Pablo did. Like yes, you see him eating and drinking at the meeting where the Medellin Cartel was born, and he comes off as a charismatic civilized leader. At the same exact time, you see his sicarios raping a woman. The duality of those scenes shows the veneer of glamour that the narcos used to disguise their evil, and I liked that it was always very apparent though the show exactly how thin it was. &&I also like the irony that the last man standing next to him isn't a sicario but a damn chauffeur xD&&I think that movie is worth watching for the insanity that it becomes. It truly becomes a “what am I watching” type film and for those who end up loving it I think it’s worth those that end up hating it (I’m close to the latter).&&>I had to put myself in his shoes and think what I would do if I was Pablo in these situations. And this is very personal. I think I’ve read everything that was written about him, but I did that in order to forget all that and then to create my own version of him. … I ended up doing things — for example, the way I was holding the pants and the way Pablo walked — I didn’t try to do that on purpose. And then people were [like], ‘You know what? You know that Pablo used to do [that].’

Just googling ""Pablo adjusting pants"" there are quite a few articles that come up mentioning Pablo actually did it, even the actor who played him mentions this. Where there sources are? I didn't dig far enough to find out

No stupid German accents... everyone is talking normally&&The Death of Stalin does this pretty well.&&> But I also don't like the trope of having characters in any historical period, and in any fictional fantasy world, speak with British accents.

Enemy at the Gates really irked me for that.&&I think it depends whether *all* the characters are speaking the same language that we hear as English.

Like if you had two story lines, one with russians and one with Germans, and we hear both in English, I think different accents help, since they show they are distinct languages in universe.

Then again, I can't remember a movie with two in universe languages that are both replaced with English off the top of my head.&&Same opinion here. The story matters most.&&I mean, I'm a native English speaker, but I'm also hispanic (not fluent in Spanish, but I speak it pretty well and can recognize a strange accent when I hear one) and it never bothered me. Sure he sounds kind of strange, but that never detracted from the show for me. In fact, Narcos is definitely my favorite series out right now.&&I'll say this about Korea. Train to Busan is a great movie. I don't think the Koreans can make a bad horror movie either. You'd think they could cast Yoo Gong to play some roles. There are a ton of talented Korean actors making movies over there. &&Hahaha. I never thought of it this way! Honestly, I couldn’t tell. But I guess that’s what studios do...if it seems passable, they’ll do it. &&That’s actually a really cool (and kinda hilarious) little detail to add in the show. Thanks for sharing.

She sighed and said “it’s so good, you guys, so good”. &&tbh, I don't really know.  I guess the different accents of spanish would be very clear to a native speaker like the regional dialects of english in America and Canada have subtle differences that sound the same to a non native speaker.  &&I've heard from a few Hispanic friends that saw it that the accent was pretty off for Colombian so I do get that. However, I think the acting itself was brilliant. Just out of curiosity, do many Hispanic actors change their accents to fit roles? If so, how difficult or not would that be? &&[deleted]&&I don't see much of a difference in that the Mafia was also real (just not those specific characters). I honestly think that the kind of people glorifying Pablo and co are going to latch onto whatever controversial figure they can because above all they want to be a controversial outsider.

To be fair the reputation of Colombian drug trafficking precedes a lot of the current well popular media. The only thing that's going to fix that is time. As someone who recently visited Colombia I certainly do my best to spread the word on how beautiful and safe the country is (Also, the cheap avocados and coconuts everywhere are like crack for me)&&I get bad reactions in real life for this because rich people reaaaally like their cocaine. Well I grew up watching lots of dead bodies on the news next to piles of cocaine and my grandpa was kidnapped and killed in Colombia for being in politics and trying to hold people accountable for it. I think it’s not irrational for me to hate cocaine and not want to be around people who add to this everyday pain. &&I think that's just an established term for this phenomenon to be honest. I feel like I've heard it a bunch before. &&Terrorist, unless you are poor and uneducated, then hero. Because he did fund lot of the Pueblos and said he would take care of their children which he ended up using as kid soldiers, son to some people he was a hero that gave them a roof over their heads. To the people that suffered from his bombings, received death threats, got kidnapped, def terrorist. &&Pretty much hated by everyone. Some of his followers still try to perpetuate his good image (especially in Medellin's poorer parts) but no one talks about him as a hero. &&Oh hey the furries are here right on schedule&&Whitest Kids You Know, I think.

They just know that there are a lot of rigthwingers in Japan, that the Japanese gov isn't very remorseful for their warcrimes, and that they don't teach it in their schools. Everyone knows how advanced and peaceful of a country Japan is. But it holds some obvious diplomatic issues.&&I debated how to word that.

But I do think mid-sentence language switch is an interesting device, and pretty much the only way you can tell a story that involves a lot of different languages. That's what I'd do in my imaginary *Kushiel's Dart* adaptation.&&Metal Gear Solid 3 did this. They're all actually speaking Russian through the whole game but it's translated to the viewers default language. They even say ""your Russian is pretty good"" at one point. 
&&The show Vikings did something similar.  It would occasionally have the characters speaking in Norse, Old English, Old French, etc. but usually had them just speaking modern English.  They mostly spoke the actual languages to characters that didn't understand them, while speaking modern English to characters who knew what they were saying.&&Enemy At The Gates made a similar decision. It allowed Ed Harris to focus on being incredibly menacing without having to put on a goofy German accent.&&Eh.. yeah but that's part of its comedic appeal.&&They spoke with English accents because Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes are English actors. The filmmakers decided to let them focus on acting rather than hamming up their Russian accents. Same reason Ed Harris was playing a German with an American accent.&&*Wonder Woman* confused me. In the scenes where the Germans are speaking amongst themselves, we can assume that they are speaking German but it's presented to the audience as English. But then there is that one part where Trevor rolls up to the party and he's just speaking with a German accent. I've never been able to figure out if we were supposed to assume he was speaking German, or if he was actually speaking English with a German accent, and everyone thought that was fine.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&He's one of my favorite actors, and the overall performance was great, but the accent was really off. However, he only had 6 months to learn Spanish and the specific accent, so it was a tough job.&&Everything. Call it.&&Everything&&Don’t just put it in your pocket.

If you scroll down a bit on the link, you can see the blood-stained tile&&His acting was great, don't get me wrong. But yes it was jarring, not subtle. Paisas (what Pablo was) have an extremely distinct accent, and Wagner isn't even a native Spanish speaker.

It'd be like if a Dutch actor played a plantation owner in rural South Carolina and kept bouncing around between trying and not trying to get the accent right.&&Wagner moura is brezilian. He learned spanish for the role.&&He sounds foreigner, it's not even about getting the ""right"" accent, he doesn't sound native at all.&&> do many Hispanic actors change their accents to fit roles? 

Yes, it's par for the course. National and regional accents are extremely distinct in Latin America. For example, Gael Garcia Bernal had to use an Argentinean accent to play Che Guevara in Motorcycle Diaries... if he had used his regular Mexican accent, the performance would be a laughingstock. He did a good job, for the record.

>If so, how difficult or not would that be?

How difficult is it for an American to effectively do an Australian or a Scottish accent? Depends on their skill level.&&The film Traffic is a good example of this. Beneico Del Toro is Puerto Rican irl and he tries to have a Mexican accent since he plays a Mexican character. The same goes for Tomas Milian who's Cuban. He absolutely kills the Mexican accent in Traffic. Puerto Rican and Cuban accents are very distinct so for ex. if these actors let their native accent flow then the movie would've definitely been laughed at/lose authenticity since it was based in Mexico and the accent there is different.

Mads was not trying to play Hopkins version.&&I don’t know, I found Mads slight  accent as Hannibal actually made the character even better, there was something creepy and eery about it. But yeah, the whole Hannibal TV series is amazing.  &&from what I heard, he took like a crash course at college in Spanish to prepare for it.

As a native spanish speaker, the first word he said in the whole series kind of tipped me off. he sounded like if some english speaking person tried to learn spanish and did, but still had a heavy accent.

Harry Potter fans already know about this film, they're already going to see it regardless of advertising. But the average Chinese person doesn't know who Jude Law or Eddie Redmayne are, just two white guys, why go see them in a film? When the average Westerner finds themself in a cinema do they feel compelled to see movies about 2 Asian dudes they don't recognise? Absolutely not.

But someone in China who doesn't know the franchise is more likely to go and see this film now because they've created a connection between the film and Chinese mythology. Doesn't seem so foreign and bizarre now.&&I think they only used this one for the premiere.. They'll most likely use the standard one for regular promotion.&&The Chinese name is literally printed on there though.&&It is not the only poster for the movie in China.

Hollywood actors make tons of money because they’re global stars. 

That said, everyone loves cute animals more than they love people. But cute animals don’t have the same box office draw as famous actors.&&According to [promotional materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GDsA36KmIM) for Grindelwald, the large feline zouwu/zouyu in the center comes from Chinese mythology, which is likely the (tenuous?) entry point/justification for the art piece.

From what we know atm, the Asian creatures will feature most prominently as highlights of a traveling circus that happens to be in France, which is to say, only tangentially :(

Although I'm still holding out hope that future installments will feature Asian locales/beastiaries.

Edit: ugh, fixed some grammar&&I think it's just traditional at this point,the first FB also had a similar poster.&&I think I would like to live in the timeline where this artist's vision WAS the stylistic direction of the movie.

The recent Ghostbusters didn't clear their censorship system (they claim it wasn't attractive to the Chinese audience), but their basic line is that ghosts that are portrayed realistically or promote cults could be banned.  The rule is a hold over from the ""Cultural Revolution"".  Still they take it on a film by film basis.  Here is an article from the BBC on it.

However, like the other person replying to mentioned, I don't get a sense that this is a Harry Potter Universe movie on first glance which is what really matters when you're using a poster like that for out of home advertisements. 

I like it as a fan of good work but if I put on my marketing hat, I wonder how effective it will be at getting people hyped about the movie. &&What a bizarre (and bogus) generalization.

Foreign posters tend to not show actors in case of licensing issues, or if the actors aren’t well known outside of the US.

The increasing escalation and tie in with the main works worries me a bit though. I think there is so much potential to pursue little side stories that viewers could enjoy a lot. Tapping into the big good vs evil conflict always makes stories so similar, leaving so little room for character relations and nuance. Harry Potter itself had exactly such a main story with increasing escalation, which is why I think many enjoyed the earlier books and movies more.&&Largely due to not having to rely on child actors, I would imagine.&&That hurts to hear because the final 3rd or so of the movie is easily the best part.&&Different feel and concept.

The last time I watched it (when it first came out) I had a lot of the problems that everyone else is complaining about here.  Having gone back and rewatched it after rereading the series I realize that all my problems with it are the same issues I have with the 1st book and it really comes down to how much world building is done.  The things I love most in Harry Potter are almost entirely from the last 3 books with a handful of things I love about 3 and 4. 1 and 2 are just kind of boring and exposition by comparison.  With that in mind rewatching Fantastic Beasts kind of made me love it, particularly the character of Newt.  Apparently the studio is trying to push him off to the side in favor of some more action hero type character but I hope they don't.  Its one of the most accurate portrayals of someone with high-functioning autism I've seen and, as someone on the spectrum, I absolutely love it.  Plus, the final battle with Grindlewald and the Obsurcus might be my favorite magical battle since the Ministry of Magic fight.  I missed it the first time but Newt takes down Griindlewald not but a spell but by the use of a magical creature and Grindlewald is just stunned by it.  I highly reccomend everyone who loves Harry Potter but was disappointed in Fatastic Beasts give it another shot and look at it not as a 9th Harry Potter movie and compare it to later movies and books but compare it to Sorcerer's Stone instead.&&That's too bad.  It's definitely a different than ""Harry Potter"".

The movie was insanely good.&&Hmmm I’d say its the kind of thing that a group dynamic helps with.

It took years for me to finally watch all the HP movies. Dunno why. I liked them, and still tune in while searching the guide if HBOs showing them. But Beasts just gabbed and dug right into me. Loved it! Maybe u/smalldoggox's hit on something: the age/maturity thing. I couldn't say for sure. Different strokes, I guess.

*am really liking this poster*&&Probably a lot to do with age and nostalgia.  Looking back, the books really weren't that well written and had a lot of inconsistencies.  But to young readers, those things didn't matter because the world building was well done and who wouldn't want to receive that invitation?&&I really liked it and Eddie Redmayne is a brilliant actor. However, it has become a hilarious movie once you realize that with the sound off it is basically a movie about Eddie Redmayne running around a fantasy world trying desperately to NEVER EVER make eye contact with the camera.&&Interesting I lived the books but could take or leave the movies. Fantastic Beasts was the best of the bunch it just felt way more like the books than any of the other movies, except maybe no 7.

I hardly even remember the first movie it was so bland and forgettable. I have zero desire to see the second. Newt is boring, and Depp being Grindlewald just feels wrong on so many levels. &&Well you read the Harry Potter books, not sure if theres a Fantastic Beasts novel&&Just think of it as Matt Smith reprising his role as the Doctor and it's a movie.

Plus, the tone was really bipolar and it didn’t seem to know what kind of film it wanted to be.

I wish they would ditch the director who’s done the last like, four or five HP films and get some fresh blood in there.  

Hoping for the best with the second one though :)&&For me, If it weren't for the beasts I would have been bored out of mind.

I hear this quite a bit, but I genuinely don't understand why. I think the first 2 Harry Potter movies are by far the most inventive and entertaining. Yes, they're childish, but Chris Columbus' vision of the wizarding world is a lot more memorable than the one that came after the first 2 movies. You go from Hogwarts almost feeling alive with all of the magic that's going on there - moving stairs, floating candles, mysterious creatures, quirky teachers, kids wearing robes and learning spells, and just the general mysterious feeling the castle has to Azkaban and on when it just feels like some kids wearing hoodies hanging out in a castle. 

The first 2 HP movies feel the most ""magical"" by far. 
&&The ending was terrible.

I just watched it for the first time and it didn’t really grip me until the final act with the squib kid and Colin Farrell killing it as the villain&&Could also be that the characters are dull and uninteresting.  There's nothing there to identify with at all.  


They also really dropped the ball in not including even a single kid, even as a minor character.  Most of the appeal of the original series was experiencing these things through a child's eyes.  Now it's just a bunch of jaded adults muddling through.&&[deleted]&&Nostalgia factor, you've already invest in the story and characters throughout the whole 8 movies and you're sure nothing can top that experience. I also felt the same when Star Trek TNG finished (the new Star Trek is just too lacking on the details IMO)&&I'm in the same boat. Harry potter was alright, but as someone who is/was a couple of years over the target age range, it felt a bit straightforward for me. May not have helped that I read all the books before seeing the films, so the tension of the unknown was lost for me.

Fantastic Beasts, though, I thought was *really* great. I quite like the way they expanded on the world, show how a different culture's (American) sensibilities affected the wizarding world. And Newt, who is vulnerable & solt-spoken, strikes me as a more interesting character than the rather typical messiah figure of Harry.

A few years back if you'd told me I would be anticipating Fantastic Beasts and dismissing The Hobbit trilogy I would've called you mad but here we are.&&Oh shut the fuck up. 

Dr. Who has never included creepy capital punishment, child abuse, vengeful murder, fascism, terrorism, repression, creepy man-to-boy grooming, and the like. Dr. Who is like an edged up Magic School Bus. 

What subplot are you fucking talking about? The entire fucking plot is Grindelwald repeatedly attacking NYC with the Obscurus and blaming Newt for it. Get the plot straight. I’ve seen way to many people attempt to smear this film by deliberately misconstruing and misrepresenting the plot and it’s BEYOND aggravating. 

&&Hmm. This is true. Very good example &&All I wanted was 2 hours of Eddie Redmayne exploring tropical climates and similar in hunt of magical beasts.

Instead, we got a cartoon-plot of a mix up, and while evil wizards were being evil, Redmayne had to complete a grind quest of *re-capturing* his beasts.&&I will disagree that the books weren’t well written.

I’m 35 so was just a bit older than most of the kids reading HP when it came out.

Two years ago I finally decided to tackle them and I totally understood the love for them.

They aren’t literary masterpieces but I would strongly disagree that they aren’t well written (excpet maybe Book 5 which really dragged for me). Oh and I still don’t like Quidditch.&&Of course they aren’t masterfully written but I still think it’s solid for a children’s book. I do feel like a lot of the inconsistencies had to do with Rowling not intending for the series to be as big as it was and having to change plot points as the series went for a more satisfying ending. Fuck the cursed child though&&>Looking back, the books really weren't that well written and had a lot of inconsistencies.

I strongly disagree. The books, in my opinion, are very well written, and they have remarkably few inconsistencies for how large and intricate the world and storylines are.&&otoh, I was in college when the books started coming out, and a bunch of my friends were super into them. they're fast-paced and entertaining, and I liked the anti-fascist plotlines which were super relevant to post-2001 uk and usa. &&I know a lot will people will disagree with what you say. But the books are filled with objectively bad characterisation and plot holes&&Yes! I remember the main character being particularly unlikeable.

All those things you mention, the stairs and creatures and candles and quirky teachers plus ghosts and paintings and the John Williams musical touch, it's all there. I feel like every shot the screen is loaded with stuff in all the corners and how the camera is always roaming around taking it all in. That movie has so many great little details and I think the scope is even bigger, it feels like the world is just always breathing and moving in a way that I love. It’s the movie where I feel like the magic is at its most believable and interactive. 

""Kids wearing hoodies hanging out in a castle"" is more how I would describe Half-Blood Prince where every shot of the castle corridors is pretty much empty. A lot of the extra magic is removed, some floating books in the library is pretty much it, no ghosts or moving staircases etc. I guess that was a stylistic choice to create a more desolate atmosphere but I think they got a little too subtle with it in the later movies. I don't feel too much of a change in Hogwarts between Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 2 where everything is supposedly completely different. It was just as barren last time we saw it!&&Not that but the goodbye with Jacob in the rain was rather beautiful I thought.&&I hated the fact that [the abused child was just murdered and no one reacted at all whatsoever and he was never mentioned again.](#spoiler) There was no saving him, and the main character cried more over his friends hooking up. &&It's David Yates. He did final fight with Voldemort, so I would suggest to not expect anything sensible&&Except for the eye rolling love plots &&It also helped that there is nothing to compare them to. When you get the level of detail but still leave enough room for the mind to fill in the rest of the world in literally the best ways to you personally like with books, rarely can a movie which does a lot more of the filling in for you and usually not too well, compete.

Movies are great for filljng in the mundane stories but much more difficult to caprure everyone's  ideas of what these fantastical world look and feel like to them coming from words and paper.&&wasn't there a plot hole with the memory wiper at the end where he said in the beginning it only erased bad memories?&&Collin Ferrel was great. Makes the twist unfortunate though.&&I mourn Colin Farrell as Percival Graves every single day. I hope there's a flashback or something, since Graves was a real person and not just an invention.&&> Most of the appeal of the original series was experiencing these things through a child's eyes.

The children that read Harry Potter are adults now, IMO it made sense to use the baker dude as the ""child"". He was amazed by everything!

&&> They also really dropped the ball in not including even a single kid, even as a minor character.

I also wasn't into the movie, but I still don't think I've ever disagreed harder. Tacking on a kid character has literally never been a good move in anything ever. There are movies out there entirely ruined because some producer thought the same thing. &&Well they did include kids, do you not remember the whole plot line about Credence and Modesty? We got to see the darker side of magic for a child and an even more extreme example of intolerance. I thought their story was very intriguing.&&I wouldn't say they're dull and uninteresting. They're just not as quirky as children tend to be.

Also, I think part of the appeal of Fantastic Beasts is that it shows the wizarding world from an adult perspective, something that was relatively lacking in Harry Potter. You get to see more of the machinations of the magical world, which Harry, as a younger man/child, was not privy to.&&I really liked it, a somewhat jaded wizarding world with less wonder contrasting against these animals. But yeah every character had like this weird timid, low self confidence aspect to their personas&&I found Newt to be interesting. He's vulnerable and spectrum-y, but he's also quite capable and stubborn. I thought the performance was top notch too. &&Yeah as crazy as it sounds it lacks some of the realness of Harry Potter- the characters don’t feel like they are real people, I’m very aware I’m watching a movie. Maybe it’s a little too polished? Like they worried about style and the visual more than the content of the story or the characters. 

Idk, it just lacked the warmth and complexity of the original series. Don’t get me wrong I’m totally going to watch the next one, but in my mind it’s not anywhere on the same level- heck it’s hardly the same universe. &&Tina is probably the most
Dull character I’ve seen in years. &&My biggest problem is that magic has no real effort. &&Except the people who grew up with Harry Potter as kids ARE adults now.&&I mean they had Creedence, but that was sort of different. You end up seeing the dark side of magic through his eyes. &&*Now it’s just a bunch of jaded adults muddling through* 

Literally every Harry Potter fan &&> They also really dropped the ball in not including even a single kid, even as a minor character.

Ugh. You probably think Meelo was a good idea too.&&There were a couple kids included in the movie; Ezra Miller’s character and his sister (?) &&Dude I completely disagree. This is the rare example of a new Hollywood movie that had great new characters. The only character I didn't remember much of was the female lead. But Newt, Queenie, & Jacob were all excellent characters with great personalities.&&Well the sequel has more room for development but I though the characters were very unique and the film just get better on second view.&&I enjoyed it, but it does fail on a few points. The antagonist and goals aren’t clear for long stretches of the movie. Grindelwald isn’t a thing until the last five minutes, and while Graves is dope we don’t know what his deal is for most of the runtime. Same for Credence. 

A lot of the story is ”Newt accidentally lets some beasts loose, stumbles into some problems with the authorities and HOLY MAGICAL ANOMALY BATMAN” and then it just ends. 

It also doesn’t help that it has like zero prior established characters or entities and a lot of the movie is kind of dark, grayish and drab. 

Hopefully the second movie will be a lot better and fix all of the above. Trailers make it look a lot more colorful, we know all the characters in some way, there is a clear antagonist and Dumbledore is in it. 

I do not think slapping a kid in there would do anything for the plot, though. In fact, I liked that everyone was an adult wizard that knew how to do magic. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel and discover magic all over again. &&yea the president charector or whatever they called her was so uniteresting to me that her charector alone made me not care for the movie&&Hard to tell, as only one FB movie is currently out.&&I love the books, but the Harry Potter movies never did much for me.

Speaking of misconstruing and misrepresenting the plot... that’s not actually what happens in the movie. Grindelwald isn’t attacking anyone. He’s taken the guise of Graves in order to investigate the appearance of the Obscurus in New York. He doesn’t actually know that it is Credence for most of the movie. Credence has those outbursts on his own, not under anyone’s orders. &&> What subplot are you fucking talking about? 

The argument I've heard frequently, and tend to agree with, is that the Harry Potter movie fans want to see is the Dumbledore/Grindelwald movie. I think there's huge storytelling potential there. Fantastic Beasts, meanwhile, is a fun movie, but a really weird choice to base a franchise on, because the source material is an 100-page fake textbook.

 If you told me five years ago there would be a) a bunch of new Harry Potter movies b) the first one of these would be Fantastic Beasts, for reasons mentioned above, and c) Fantastic Beasts would *tie into* the Grindelwald movie, I would've laughed at you. &&I was hoping for an animal documentary with Sir David Attenborough narrating. &&The movie didn’t center around beasts themselves. There was about 20 minutes of the movie that specifically concerned magical animals? The other 1 and 40 minutes concerned MACUSA, the NSPS, The Obscurus, Credence/Graves, etc...

The beasts are a scapegoat for the Obscurus attacks and Grindelwald’s means to blame newt for his attacks on NY. The film opens with a scene of Grindelwald’s escape and a news reel, and the end of the third act climax has him captured. 

In a meta-sense, it’s revealed Newt was sent to NY by Dumbledore to look for the Obscurial, Credence Barebone, the most important character in film 1. 

You guys need to pay attention to the fucking film, instead of twisting the plot to suit a criticism you think fits, but doesn’t. &&Fantastic Beast and Where to Find them is the book he writes of his entire career and shows what we will see in the series. But if you don’t know that it is misleading.&&book 5 was an emo fest. i'm your age and read it in high school when i discovered the series at book 4. it was a good fantasy that really immersed you in it's word.&&Just out of interest, what would qualify a book as poorly-written in your view? Which books do you consider to be well-written?&&Just curious, why don't you like Quidditch? Not judging, just interested what your thoughts are&&I'm curious about other large scale series you've read?&&At the risk of your next comment being removed, how so?&&objectively bad characterization and plot holes

For instance?
Genuinely curious not tryna be a dicky &&No, they aren’t. The only criticism I’ve heard people try to smack onto this series is “bla bla bla PLOTHOLES” all of which tend to be preferences, misunderstandings, and subjective views, not actual potholes. 

The fact that you say “objectively bad characterization”...um, where? This makes absolutely no sense as a literary critique, and it sound like your forcing objectivity into subjectivity - an arrogant move. &&It's not that he's unlikeable. He just doesn't relate to you like the old crew.&&The one with spidey laying down was definitely used at my theater, but ok. I never even saw the one you posted. &&IDK man. I only ever saw the one with him laying down in his jacket on the walls in the theater. And when I bought it online it was that same image too.&&Never saw the one you posted at a theater. Only the one of him laying down chilling.&&Nah, most theatres just kept the original jacket image. It was the primary marketing image for most of the buildup, it wasn’t until a few days after release that everything else really started being used.
I recall seeing a stand-up image of that poster at my theatre. &&“If my face isn’t on the poster, what’s the point of being in the movie?”

-US actors, probably &&I mean are they though? Or is it an artistic/marketing *choices*?

For example does Zendaya really have the clout during contract negotiations to get her face on the poster but the entire supporting cast of Doctor Strange doesn’t?

Kurt Russell’s name is on the Guardians 2 poster with the original 5 Guardians’ actor names but he isn’t. Meanwhile Rooker, Gillan, Klementieff, and Debicki all got their faces on the poster but not their names.

For Black Panther Daniel Kaluuya’s face made it on the poster but not his name. Was this contractual or trying to capitalize his new fame from Get Out?&&That was not contractual. It was only a request from Williams&&Chinese characters are more than just letters&&I mean, there is a niffler (almost) dead center in this poster which is a creature from the harry potter universe so.. there IS something visually connecting the poster to HP world. 

&&The title is written on the lower right corner.&&The Nifflers (of which there are 5 in this poster) have been their most heavily marketed creature from the first Fantastic Beasts movie. They alone should clue you in to what this movie is. &&Of&&There's a difference between ""let's not put skulls and blood in to not give the censors any excuse"" and ""censors will ban anything with skulls and blood, no exceptions"".

I also could have sworn one of the previews for Crimes showed [the Obscurus](#spoiler)?

I may be wrong though.&&It’s crazy for a director who is always priding himself on character work that he could have just thrown all of that away at the most important moment. I also thought the Molly/Bellatrix fight was a big waste tbh, as fun as it was to see Julie Walters deliver the line. That scene had so much fire in the book and was so blah the way they did it.&&It's got the best comedy by far though&&I'll take one plot hole over dozens of inconsistencies any day&&The movie is about a wizard with a zoo of imaginary creatures in his briefcase. We can let the plot hole slide. &&Agreed. Outside of his personal issues I don’t mind Jonny Depp in the role it just seems like a waste of Farrell and his character &&I enjoyed the first one, but that twist is the reason I won't see the second.&&To be fair, half the globe read those books as adults - they were *that* popular. &&The baker dude is my favorite character.  The light touch to the romance was so well done.  I'm glad he returns.&&I sometimes feel odd for liking Fantastic Beasts. It was not the greatest thing ever but I liked the characters and feel. I left with my heart warmed and intrigued. And the heartwarming feeling was from Kowalski’s last smile.&&There was an entire push for this philosophy in the late 70s. Cartoons added characters like Scrappy Doo and the Wonder Twins. Even Godzilla had a little kid that he was just... friends with? I agree, almost always a bad move to shoehorn in a kid ""for the kids to relate to!""

Harry Potter's largest audience is the adults who grew up with the books and films.&&Almost never. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an exception, in my opinion. Short Round was awesome.&&I'm not disagreeing with you, but do you think you could provide some examples of movies ruined by kids?&&The dialogue itself was pretty sparse and uninteresting. I can get a soft-spoken lead, as the guy's written as an eccentric researcher, but the rest of the cast was also lacking in chemistry and seemed to be half asleep.&&Welcome to real life. Extroverted American society seems to really stigmatize lack of confidence and timidity, and while it’s not a positive thing, lots of people are predisposed to low self-esteem and social anxiety and have to live and conduct normal life regardless. People that have never struggled with a conflict of self image and/or social strife tend to be remarkably oblivious, superficial, aggravatingly callous, overly positive, and even brutal individuals. That’s because they’ve never thought through their actions before, how it makes them look, and how it affects others. 

Sorry, people who look down on those with a lack of self confidence and timidity are usually shallow and mean. And these are also the types of people that will tell you someone is “too nice”. No, they just don’t barrel through life without taking into consideration how their words, actions, behavior, tone, and body language affects others. It’s important to mind this, though not wise to let these concerns consume you. These callous individuals that don’t mind this often cause immense damage to those around them and resultantly to themselves, and they never consider that they need to change their social-emotional behavior if they’re going to fix things. 



&&The adults in the original series were similar. It was almost entirely the kids that did everything heroic.&&I like how being eccentric just means autism now. &&The best part for sure &&Sure but that's been a problem that started when David Yates took over with Order of the Phoenix. The Dumbledore v Voldemort fight with excellent but the rest of it and all movies after have been terribly lazy. All of Yates' films have a dreary, bleak quality to them. I don't know why this style resonates with people so much. I hate that they kept him around permanently. 

Sometimes there is artistic flair that I like but usually his movies just bum me out.&&Omg this would be amazing. I’d sit through hours of this for magical beasts!&&Maybe because it simply just doesn't work as a game. The rules are very badly thought out.&&I am not the op but I agree and I have red nearly all big fantasy series if that is what you are referring to.&&I’ve read ASOIAF, The Inheritance Cycle, the Dune series, LOTR (plus The Hobbit and The Silmarillion), the Bartimaeus Sequence, and The Dark Tower series. I plan on starting The Witcher series sometime soon.&&Right? The HP series is pretty much the poster child for a world being built around a plot vs a plot taking place in an existing world. &&Do you mean how were the plots relevant to politics? 

Post-9/11, the United States and UK went super nationalist, introducing unconstitutional legislation such as the Patriot Act, invading Iraq and Afghanistan etc. To anyone who was politically active at the time, the Ministry of Magic plots were clear references to Bush and Blair. &&im not him, but pureblood/ mudblood stuff was very similar to racial purity narratives when you think about it&&A lot of people point to Time Turners as a huge plot hole, because why didn't people just go back and change things for the better? There's a reason JKR got them to smash all the time Turners at the Ministry, time travel throws a real wrench in most plots. &&Agreed. As an introverted male in my late 20s I actually found I related more with Newt then I ever did with Harry. His compassion for things less fortunate is something I find lacking in the ubermacho and Everyman protagonist going around these days. &&The other five beasts  all appear in the movie, as well.&&Gay Wizard Hitler&&And then she decided to not mention it in the movie covering the time period in the aftermath of Dumbledore and Grindlewald's relationship, part of the reason why it actually happened (according to canon.)&&I'm pretty sure I saw him in the trailer for this new one unless I'm thinking of something else.&&You might be correct, but it looked like he exploded into a million pieces and they never followed up with any ""We'll rehab and cure him"" dialogue. I found the movie kind of confusing so could be totally wrong about him dying. &&He also just looks *nothing* like I pictured Gellert Grindelwald. It's been a while since I read the books, but wasn't Grindelwald supposed to be an eerily beautiful man?

Not that Johnny Depp isn't a handsome guy, but the ""Frost King meets fork in an electrical socket"" look that they've gone with doesn't mesh with what I always pictured.&&True.

Are there any books right now that have the same impact on kids and adults?&&It was so different from HP that everything seemed new and fresh. 

HP was from the POV of students and school life.

Now it's the real world with real-use of magic (even though there's not that much being used..)

I got the same feelings as you!&&>Even Godzilla had a little kid that he was just... friends with?

Do you mean Godzuki from the 1978 animated series, or is this a human kid in another show or film?&&Yeah, that did not stop though, it was around well into the 90s where any sitcom with falling ratings thought they needed to mix things up, so they'd add in a new kid, usually a cousin or something. Hell, didn't the Fairly Odd Parents do the same thing? Watched a bit of it as a young teen, think it went another like 10 seasons and there's a dog and a baby now?

Then there's every horror/action/survival movie ever where a kid gets added just to be something to protect, and is given as much character and agency as cardboard box. 

&&You take that back about Jan from Space Ghost! &&The Phantom Menace of the Star Wars prequels being the most famous example (To be fair, I absolutely adore TPM and its my favourite of the Star Wars prequels...)&&The chemistry was definitely lacking. It also felt like two different movies tonally, the first half was a light monster-hunting movie (which I didn't mind at all) and the second half is darker and seemed out of scope. But I guess that's what happens when you have a franchise to set up. 

Maybe I just think Fantastic Beasts is a weird thing to base a five movie series on. I'd much prefer, if they had to do it, to just do an anthology series. The Dumbledore and Grindelwald stuff is great and has potential to be expanded on, but I think intercutting it with the Fantastic Beasts stuff is a weird choice. Just let each movie do its own thing. &&I didnt say the quality was a bad thing, I said that the homegeneity in the characters was a small demarcation against the writing. If you recall I liked the movie and in the end the quiet pensive intellectual wins out without compromising who he is.&&It's almost like... it's a book with kids as the stars. Almost also like how adults act in real life :D&&I'm a teacher, and I work with kids on the spectrum daily. The portrayal of Newt is more than just eccentric. He displays traits consistent with manageable social anxiety.&&The golden snitch throws a wrench into the whole game.&&The HP series is absolutely built around a plot, especially compared to a series like ASOIAF... but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. While Westeros (and Essos) is clearly more detailed than the HP world, ASOIAF suffers from its own inconsistentancies and, unlike HP, will almost certainly never be concluded in a satisfying manner (or any manner, for that matter).

At any rate, I find the HP world to be very full and engaging, even if some of the details were added after the books.&&The time turners were a closed loop kind of time travelling. They couldn't change the past like in prisoner of Azkaban. They could only do what had already been done.&&Goodbye&&*Gay Wizard Nazi David Bowie &&I would’ve loved for Mads Mikkelson to be cast as Grindelwald. &&Voldemort was handsome in his younger days, too. Messing with dark arts is apparently awful for your appearance.&&I don’t know if we ever get a description of an older/adult Grindelwald in the books, the only instances were him as a teenager and shortly thereafter when he steals the Elder Wand. I’m guessing being a dark wizard probably changes your appearance for the worse, much like it did for Voldemort. &&The problem is, he looks a little *too* ”dark wizardy”. The weird eye, the quirky hair and moustache... they could have gone with something a bit more muted (even keeping Johnny Depp) and I would have been fine with it. &&Depp 20+ years ago was eerily beautiful. 

Funny how some guys grow into their looks. 
&&Saw Fantastic Beasts 2 today - all I can say is that it's fantastic and you don't need to worry.&&My kids absolutely love the *50 Shades* series.&&I assume he meant Minya from the 1967 film appropriately titled, Son of Godzilla&&One of the animated series also had a human that he was friends with&&Godzilla vs Megalon has a kid in it who is like mates with Jet Jaguar or something.&&I blame Scrappy Doo for this awful trend.&&Solid Snake would like to have a word with you about Cardboard Boxes...&&Having social anxiety and some awkward mannerisms does not mean he's on the spectrum. I've only seen it once so may have missed some things, but he demonstrates considerable empathy throughout the movie to both people and animals, despite professing the oppinion that animals are easier to care for, with simpler needs.

Being honest it was discussed in decent length in another reddit thread where /u/BridgettBane hypothesised about Newt's odd behaviorisms on /r/fantheories:

> If you've watched Fantastic Beasts you can see Newt has a very odd way of approaching people sometimes. He hunches in a little, tilts his head down, avoids eye contact. At times he even seems to stoop to be lower than them.

>This isn't an odd personal mannerism- not entirely anyway. This is the habit of a zoologist who is used to avoiding dominance displays and showing submission. He is using his body to communicate that he is submissive and harmless. The SpeakEasy Scene (spoiler alert, the link shows several clips from the movie but I have time-stamped it so it goes to the correct scene) shows him tilting his body way from the boss, casting his eyes downward. It's only when he starts to protect his Bowtruckle and needs to assert dominance that he starts to sit up and make direct eye contact.

>Newt Scamander is used to dealing with all manner of beasties and knows exactly the affect his body language has on others.

&&Wait, does having manageable social anxiety seriously place a kid “on the spectrum”&&I’ve seen theories that Quidditch is suffering because brooms are getting faster and faster, you hear about all these historical Quidditch games that lasted days, while the longest in the series is like 4 hours, and that was before Harry got his Firebolt.

I said he was spectrum-y. Social anxiety is one of many possible symptoms of people on the autism spectrum, and it's also something non-spectrum people display. I never said they \*had\* to go hand in hand, and I think that's pretty obvious from my response.

Fan theories are interesting. I'll give them that.&&The spectrum just keeps getting bigger, with existing disorders being lumped in. My condition, Asperger's, was classified as autistic 2013.

First Poster for Korean Historical-Zombie Film 'Rampant',40433,9s7edz,https://i.redd.it/ua7mzd8o50v11.jpg,1059,1540765667.0,,"Trailer: https://youtu.be/MODgVTyihbU

Looks fun.&&Can we please just talk about Rampant?&&Fuck Yeah!! 

Those Koreans know how to make damn fine Zombie Movies.&&It blows my mind that there's so many high quality movies in other countries that the majority of people from other countries never see because of the language difference. I really enjoy when foreign films are available for anyone, despite the language.

This one looks great!&&I'm kinda surprised there weren't more ""history"" based zombie movies back during the zombie boom. Seems like there are eras primed for some fun zombie action. &&> The action story of a hero named Yi Chung who fights against “Night Demons” to save the Joseon nation. Yi Chung is the son of the king, and the greatest martial artist in the world. Although he is given to the Qing Empire as a political hostage, he returns home when his brother, the Crown Prince Yi Young, calls him back after many years. And it’s because of the nightmarish monsters plaguing the country that Yi Chung is tasked to destroy. Prince Yi Chung will be fighting the nightmarish monsters alongside Kim Ja-joon and Deok-hee.&&""Historical""&&Honestly I'm always surprised by the lack of historical zombie flicks. Like zombies in the dark ages or even stone age would be cool I think.&&If there ISN'T a scene with a Turtle ship spewing cannon shot at hoards of zombies i will be disappointed.&&Hyun Bin is daddy. &&Woody Harrelson really is an amazing actor, I barely recognized him.&&HYUN BIN? I'M HERE FOR IT.&&Prequel to Train to Busan, Wagon to Busan&&Yo....why did no one ever think about this before. &&Dong-Gun. That's all I really have to say.&&Not so thrilled about zombie, train to busan not withstanding, but I can’t get enough period Korean flicks.  Sign me up&&Well, this looks fucking metal.&&Let's focus on the movie people &&I saw this movie on Saturday (I live in Korea). Personally, I like it better than train to busan. The ""zombies"" are more ""meaty"" and fleshy than the ones in Train To Busan and the historical setting is novel. It's a little slow to start because there's a lot of typical historical political scheming that can be found in most Korean historical movies. But it's pretty fresh and the antagonist is pretty awesome. &&heh historical zombie.  i like that &&History + Zombies sound neat!&&I'm a big fan of Dong-Gun.&&Hey I'm only here to talk about Rampant. Next question.&&[deleted]&&Everybody talking about needing this, but did everyone forget Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies? &&What lead role does Matt Damon play!?&&Dong-Gun could literally be a movie title in and of itself.. with its own slogan: Mess with the dong, and you get the gun. Vice versa works too I suppose.&&Hope this will get a cinema released in my country like Train to Busan did&&This film was already released in Korea and the general consensus seems to be that it's an *okay* stupid-fun movie. Audience rating is currently at 6.2/10 and critics rating is at 5.2/10. 

For comparison: Train to Busan has 7.3 & 7.1 audience and critic score, respectively.
&&If it's anything like Train to Busan I will probably enjoy it. &&Let's keep the discussion on Rampant please.&&Train to busan was a masterpiece.&&... The casting is solid but these Korean zombie films are just so cringy and predictable, coming from a Korean person myself.

Some movies were done great with some horror/thriller aspects by having only a few zombie-like creatures as the nemesis in the plot, but majority of these mass zombiepocalypse plots just end up being another seasonal popcorn flick and nothing more.

Something is just very off when Korean movies attempt to emulate Hollywood or Sundance quality. Either its plot ends up being poorly written or the visuals and SFX are off. Most start off with great open plots but ends up being yet another Korean drama-esque ending with family values or sacrifice or some typical ""Main character magically solved everything and happy ending! hey why not a gag cutscene with a cameo"" shit. 

Not demeaning the Korean movie industry, Korean romance and drama films are great, but western-themed movies with heavy visuals just never end up being good. &&I'd watch the hell outta that, ""historical"" aside. It looks awesome!&&This movie looks badass, just on this poster alone&&Looks dope&&Uhm... Ok, I'm convinced. &&This looks amazing. &&Woah, that flippin sword looks badass.&&Can we talk about that sword? It's both brutal and elegant at the same time, somehow. &&Yes.&&I didn’t know I wanted this until now but I do! I fucking do...&&Feels awesome to watch a movie that premieres before it does in the US for once haha, just watched it yesterday and it was a fun movie&&My entire life I always thought foreign films were absolutely horrible, low budget, etc...

But after seeing a ton on Netflix and other services, I just can't get enough! Started with the Monkey king series.&&Train to Busan and Rampant will probably trigger a conspiracy theory about Korea potentially being the ground zero for a 21st Century Zombie apocalypse &&Historical-zombie film......&&They should make a Breaker movie&&Um.  Hell yes.&&Is that hyun bin I see? I’ll have to watch it.&&Looks interesting! 

Kind of wish someone would pick up the Hive comic for a TV show. Though that's with bugs in modern day compared to zombies in a historical drama movie &&trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MODgVTyihbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MODgVTyihbU)&&First poster?!? This is playing in cinemas in Australia from Wednesday. &&If Train to Busan is anything to go off of, I’m hyped.&&Saw it Friday. It's not bad, i liked it. You're welcome for the in-depth review. &&How do i get the last name Dong-Gun?&&Please be as good as Train to Busan.&&I wish my name was Dong-Gun&&I read that as Keanu and was confused but on board &&>> historical zombie film


Did I miss something in history?&&What is it with Koreans and Zombies??&&Giant enemy crab&&> Made by the Makers of “Train to Busan”

Will be a lot of fun.&&That looks awesome&&This movie looks amazing. I'm in.&&I know it's the historical style but I cannot help but see Mayflower pilgrims in those hats.

And yeah it does look fun.&&Damn that’s actually badass &&Saw a preview for it in theatre a couple weeks ago and wasnt sure it what I was watching was real. I'm excited for this one.&&Agreed. I’m digging these classic looking samurai movies with these neat premises. Like Blade of the Immortal.

edit: a word&&My favorite Korean movie is still `The Wailing` fantastic film watched it like 3 times. &&They really nail horror or suspense in my opinion.&&> Those Koreans know how to make damn fine Zombie Movies.

Train to Busan and...?&&It opened in Korea, and it's apparently utter shite.&&I remember being excited when King Fu Hustle was actually at my chain movie theater with subs, it wasn't even a ""special screening"" it was there for 2 weeks. That's more than Shin Godzilla got.&&Language isn't really a barrier, distribution, region locking and copyright are the barriers. For the majority of the world Hollywood movies are foreign language movies.&&You should watch “tale of two sisters”. Phenomenal Korean horror film. &&I don’t think it’s because people don’t like watching foreign language films, I think it’s because they are not marketed that well in the US.&&I remember when Bravo used to play a bunch of indie movies and foreign films before they switched over to the crappy reality tv model they have now. It was one of the few ways that I could see foreign films before having access to Netflix, on demand or the internet.&&Same with music&&Any recommendations?&&Once had a customer complain at me because we were charging full price for foreign films, which was a travesty as we had all these good American films available. The films she had rented and wanted refunds for were 2 for a dollar, clearly marked as foreign language.&&Bro, the Asian cinema is actually bonkers, they are incredible most of the times

China, Japan and south Korea always come to mind&&Musket vs Zombies would make for some great suspense. Then put some gatling at the end, and the Union and the Confederate joining forces in a fort for the big finale.&&Just saw the trailer to Overlord. Shit seems like CoD zombies kicked up to 11.&&Medieval Europe might be fun! But on second thought, maybe knights in plate would be *too* effective against zombies to make for a very interesting film. &&What about history horror movies in general? There was Abraham lincoln: vampire hunter - that's all I can think of rn&&Check out pride and prejudice and zombies. It's a parody of ""pride & prejudice"" and actually pretty entertaining! It's a world where everyone is already used to zombies existing so everyone just gets taught fighting and stuff like that. &&In the book world war z there is one chapter about a zombie attack during the roman occupation of britain. Was always one of my favorite parts of it. Looks like i mixed up his books like the comments below say buts still a great chapter&&There is a whole genre of Hong Kong Qing-dynasty zombie films.&&Yes civil war American era zombie film would be amazing. Some zombie disease forms after all the bloodshed immediately after the war causing an already battle fatigued America to fight yet again. &&I've always wanted to see a historical superhero or mutant movie. &&Were political prisoners so easily released back then? Like was it as easy saying ""Hey sorry, my brother said I need to go home, I can't be your prisoner anymore. Was fun!"" ?&&> Joseon nation

They had a kick-ass flag: https://i.redd.it/3roh6glbmzpy.png&&So here's this giant enemy crab.&&Because calling it a Zombie-Period piece is asking for trouble. &&I hope he meant to say “period” otherwise someone needs to tell OP that zombies don’t exist&&There is a whole genre of Hong Kong horror-comedy films about zombies in the Qing-dynasty (same time period of this film). They’re all pretty old (80’s 90’s mostly) but fun to watch. &&Pride and Prejudice and Zombies might be of interest.  &&Need damn *freedoms* ya?&&""This is mah boomstick!""&&Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is a mediaeval/steampunk anime if you want some zombie action without assault rifles.&&[deleted]&&George A Romero's King of the Dead&&[Abe Lincoln vs Zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tFaQYSFLuE)

Edit: Discard the above, looks pretty bad. This is the one I was actually thinking about: [Abe Lincoln vs Vampires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34x6m-ahGIo)&&Well Game of Thrones is loosely based on medieval history and it has zombie ice demons, among other supernatural things.&&Zombies are a lot less threatening when everyone is Michonne. &&The Gilgamesch epic is ancient and talks of zombies.

Hyped!&&I don't know who he is but he has an amazing name&&I was around for this, and it’s been like 5 years ago or more by now. &&Woody Harrelson?&&Did you mean, **Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter**? Or did you mean **Pride + Prejudice + Zombies**?  Both of which could've used more love. &&Everyone forgot Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress&&Lol. He plays the old mystical black man who gives spiritual advice and a magic powder to the warriors before the final battle. &&It's pronounced more like Dong Goon. It's a pretty common boy's name.

Seeing this name triggered my PTSD.

... Dong Gun if you see this, put your sandals back on your feet and stop playing with Miso's hair! 

Edit: nevermind, this actor is 장동건 Jang Dong Geon. Not the name I was thinking of. Romanization is always super weird to me.
&&Damn I forgot about that movie. That shit was good&&I just watched that last night. The friggin feels. What a great zombie flick&&Train to Busan was the first zombie movie I genuinely enjoyed since the Dawn of the Dead remake. I'm looking forward to this.&&Straight into my veins. &&Such a great film. Was my first look into Korean cinematography &&Will this get a US release??&&First thing it came to my mind&&Absolutely love Train to Busan. &&>Made by the Makers of “Train to Busan”

Sold&&Came here to see if it was thanks, gonna have to watch it now &&It says that, but who? I don't see anyone that was involved in Train to Busan on the IMDb page for this movie.&&Actually, that sounds like a good movie; what happened to the Roanoke settlement=Zombies. Uh and then again maybe not....&&Gats, made from horse hair and was a sign of social status.&&Saw it in theaters, absolutely worth it&&Based on a very good and long-running comic, published by Dark Horse in the US.

I very much dislike live action adaptations so I won't see it, but if anyone does see it without having read the source material I'd encourage it.

Fair warning: the first few volumes were edited to be left-to-right using the original, unmodified panelling (no speech bubbles or sfx). They didn't make enough money to continue, so it's right-to-left after that point. ... honestly not sure if the older version is still in print or if it's just omnibuses now, though&&**The best Korean movies on Netflix?** 1) The Wailing (2016) 2) Mother (2009) 3) Train to Busan (2016) 4) Bluebeard (2017) 5) Forgotten (2017) 6) Sea Fog (2014) 7) Lucid Dream (2017) 8) The Beauty Inside (2015)

Plus like the other poster said, The VVitch and Brotherhood of the Wolf (although the last time I tried to watch it, the bluray subtitles were way off and made it unwatchable). Blood Tomahawk.

So if he'd grown close enough to his captor family, and they believed him to be loyal, it's not implausible that they might grant him certain freedoms.
&&Definitely not, but then again, zombies.&&It’s not really a political prisoner in the modern sense of the word.

Basically important members of the royal families of tributary countries “volunteers” to be a part of the Chinese court to show that they have nothing to fear.   Sometimes it’s more voluntary than others, so if China’s pretty sure he’s not going back just so Korea can attack China, he’s free to go. &&I guess if the guy can single handedly fight zombie hoards using swords then there has to be an extent to which his role as prisoner is at least partially voluntary.

I even made a game out of the zombies/vampires and played it at recess in elementary school.

In lore and movies, the zombies move by jumping/bouncing great lengths and heights. They don't ""see"" but detect people by breath. There are scenes where the characters are told this as they're being chased; they hold their breath and the zombies stop. They are controlled by Taoist (I think) wizards and spells written on yellow tags stuck to their foreheads bind them. &&Are you sure it's zombies, not jiangshi (those hopping ones with talisman on their forehead)? There's a difference.&&I was thinking even further back but I'll check it out, thanks for the recommendation.&&Exactly my thoughts &&I hear it's like bootleg Attack on Titan.

My two faves. <3&&hahahahahaa good one&&Joseon Korea isn't particularly ancient. Depending on when this is, the West could very well be going through the industrial revolution.&&It is pretty shitty whenever they aren't fighting zombies though.  
Then again, that mad fucking steampunk aesthetic alone warrants a watch.&&Oldboy, The Handmaiden, Mother&&The Admiral: Roaring Currents is badass, about the Korean navy defeat of japan.  War of the arrows is basically a Korean House of Flying Daggers.  Jeon Woochi: The Taoist Wizard is funny as hell and a great fantasy romp.  Anything from Park Chan-Wook is worth watching if you like thrillers and have a strong stomach.  The Host, Bong Joon-Ho not the Stephanie Meyer flick, is a great monster movie with great character work.&&I love Korean movies.

&&The Host is a fantastic Korean monster movie. Great place to start&&If you like horror movies watch “a tale of two sisters”. For a good heist movie watch “the thieves”&&I think ""Old Boy"" is Korean. Pretty great movie&&Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies came out back in 2012. That’s what I was referring to&&Is it in theaters or available online?&&Check out I Am A Hero.&&As mainstream as it is, what did you think of zombieland? I know it was for more comedic purposes, but I thought it was a very solid zombie film with an awesome final stand. 

Personally, it’s towards the top of my list, but wonder wha other zombie fans think of it.&&are you me? this is exactly what i thought&&

[The good stuff](https://media.giphy.com/media/DmXgQCxBTguFa/giphy.gif)&&Check out Memories of Murder, The Host, amd Man from Nowhere!&&The Wailing (still on Netflix) was my first and sent me down a rabbit hole for a couple months. Korean cinema is fantastic and they don't hold back&&A lot of the text in the trailer is in English so it probably will be on netflix like Train to Busan was.&&Yeah I was thinking that and then I was like so would the zombies be indi- Nooooooooooooooo

But Native Americans vs a boat of european settlers that got sick on the way and turned into zombies? **THAT'D BE SWEET**&&There was Pride and Prejudice and Zombies that's kinda the same time period.&&In Supernatural ""croatoan"" was a zombie disease, they don't touch on it more than a couple episodes but it's weirdly on point with your idea.&&Train to Busan was absolutely amazing and completely refreshing for a zombie movie.&&I don't know which of these are on Netflix, but it'd be blasphemous to mention Korean movies without Oldboy and other great stuff from Park Chan-wook. Also: The Man from Nowhere, I Saw the Devil.&&Don't forget Office (2015) and Tunnel (2016)&&is netflix missing lots of the great classic korean films or are you just not listing them? &&The Wailing might be the most effective horror movie I've ever seen. Left a pit in my stomach. Glad to see it at the top of that list. &&I could not get into Lucid Dream&&Upvoted and saved.&&Korean cinema has so many amazing horror, and especially thriller-movies. &&Woody Harrelson did an AMA back when his movie Rampart was coming out and it was a complete disaster.&&~~https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/~~

EDIT: Use Q&A sort: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/?sort=qa&&I still find it funny how much I've gone from being disappointed to find my thought was already a comment, to how I am today, where I go in expecting to find my thought in a high voted comment, and if it's not there, I worry I misunderstood something.&&How long have I been on Reddit? I swear the sun was just out.&&But what else is there? &&Good on ya man. Just found it hilarious &&And to end the trilogy: Bus to DMZ&&There actually is an animated prequel called Seoul Station on Shudder.&&Flight to Jeju would be even better. &&Lemme guess the antagonists are a bunch of snakes? And a loud American guy saves the day?&&I thought about this when I was on my last flight. You’d be soooooo fucked. Especially one a small plane. There’s one small aisle and not much room to climb over seats anyway. &&I’m tired of these MF zombies on this MF plane!&&I was amazed at how the child actress was really selling her scenes where she was crying. &&Until we meet again...&&Train to Busan could not be more different from the 28 Days franchise.&&I used to catch that very train to Busan every time I was in South Korea. Which is why I have no trouble believing the phones and Internet kept working even in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Incredibly smooth and fast ride too.&&depends on what you like..

old boy is a classic, check out that director.. a solid portion of his work is fantastic. most recently he did the handmaiden, which is phenom

i saw the devil

man from nowhere

chingu


and uh.. i'm a drunk and i forget lots of titles, but there are blogs full of people much more helpful than i&&Try Chan-wook Park movies. My favorites are Joint Security Area and the Vengeance trilogy ( Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, Lady Vengeance)&&Every single movie marked in red in this image https://imgur.com/gallery/ksKji#zyLVVPh is worth giving a shot. I've seen almost all and not a single one has disappointed me yet.&&One of the best western movies in the last twenty years is somehow a Korean film taking place in 1920s Manchuria. The Good, The Bad, and The Weird I highly recommend. 

They also have some filmakers that are excellent at mixing suspense/action luke the following films:

Man From Nowhere (Think a well done Liam Neeson/Taken kind of feel, with a lead actor that can actually do fight scenes)

I Saw the Devil (Action movie and psychological horror)

Old boy (Landmark film)&&I Saw The Devil is one of my favourite movies of all time. When I first saw it I broke down and cried at the ending for a good minute. What an incredible film. &&Are those on the flix? &&I always say people should watch that before Oldboy or The Man From Nowhere.

So intense. &&there's an edited version *without* that?

what the fuck is that the US dvd version&&Just watch the pirated versions online. I watched it a few times and they had all of the politics in it.&&I saw the version on Amazon Prime.  Is that the edited version?&&Paranormal-but-more-psychological type&&And now that box is probably haunted lol. &&Lol I remember watching Two Sisters then checking out the trailer for The Uninvited.

I tapped out when shit started exploding. What the fuck America.&&I'll take subtitles over dubbing any day. &&The Raid 2 played in my local theater when it came out. I was super pumped to see it on the big screen. I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but it was kinda sad only seeing a total of 4 people at the showing.&&We were lucky in Australia that one of our government run stations (SBS) shows (or at least used to) foreign language films all the time, so we're used to films with subtitles.

It's a shame really, English is about the only language catered to worldwide where people will subtitle their films into (everyone else is more regional). We should be happy about how lucky we are to benefit as a result, no other language (yet) is as privileged.&&Yeah there are those types of people who don’t ever tell you a reason for not watching and you sit their contemplating if they are racist or ethnocentric. &&Thanks&&/r/anime leaks? Nice.&&That book is awesome &&Yonkers, never forget.&&Don't forget the account of the Roman Army dealing with a zombie infestation in the author's previous zombie book.

Here - http://zombie.wikia.com/wiki/121_A.D.,_Fanum_Cocidi,_Caledonia_(Scotland)&&That movie is the fucking bees dick&&>Deadites aren't conventional zombies.

Yeah, they were demon possessions. &&Depends on the time period, the later you go in the medieval period, the more common metal armor becomes. However, regardless of metal armor, the *extremely* abundant gambeson is a very effective armor. A gambeson was, basically, a trenchcoat made of many layers of tough, linen clothing. It was tough enough that, unless your weapons were, literally, razor sharp, you weren't getting through it, and it could stop all but specially designed arrows from penetrating. It was also stupidly cheap to make and repair, so even peasants could have one, as they could, essentially, just sew 5 or 6 shirts together. If it helps, think of wearing 3-5 carhart/denim jackets in top of each other: zombie ain't biting through that.

Honestly, with the cheap armor, fortifications, and a moderately-to-well armed society, the medieval period citizen would likely fair better than modern day. Of course, modern day military would utterly wreck a zombie apocalypse, unless it was some sort of airborne disease/biological weapon that took out the military first.&&I really didn't expect to enjoy the movie as much as I did &&Pretty sure he's referring to the Zombie Survival Guide by the same author. It's also a collection of stories about random zombie outbreaks throughout history (and modern times).&&Reek still fucked over the Starks&&Like how Mr Miracle was given to Darksied  from Highfather&&Extremely compelling argument. I now see where my line of thinking was flawed.&&He is described as the greatest martial artist in the world, but perhaps he is the worst escape artist in the world, too.&&No, the Dharma initiative.&&Yeah, but they were hunted down to extinction./s&&RIIIIIIDDDGGGEEE RAAAACEEEEERRRRRR&&That's where I draw the line. Come on Masterchief, let's get the *fuck* outta here!&&/r/totalwar is leaking

This action **DOES** have my consent!&&10-11 Days to go mothertruckers!

Gonna get all the goddamn lizard trinkets I can.
&&HE’S A-RISING FROM THE DEEP&&How about Korean Zombie movie set in XXXX?&&Not necessarily zombies, but undead are in a movie called mr vampire. Was a pretty funny movie back in the day&&Find the ""Mr. Vampire"" series.  Which is the Hong Kong films mentioned.  Those are based on the jiangshi zombie/vampire from Chinese folklore.

Here's a good primer for you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi_fiction&&Yeah those bouncing zombies are cool. Aren't there a couple in *big trouble in little China*?&&Can you say more about it? I'm curious!&&It’s not the greatest movie, but the set design and costuming was pretty spot on. &&Attack on titan but with trains and overpowered nailguns&&The joke is that the title is similar to the Woody Harrelson movie *Rampart*. Harrelson did an AMA a number of years back on reddit, but he wasn't too clear about how it's supposed to be structured, so he got annoyed that everyone was asking questions about things other than *Rampart*.&&Lee dong-wook for me :) but I think Train to Busan was pretty popular, so I think Gong Yoo will get some international love.

&&Good one. CG hasn't aged too well but it really is a fantastic movie.&&Netflix. Its a really smart zombie movie. Highly recomend it&&Looks fun. Where can I watch it online legally? &&Oh right I completely forgot about that. I LOVED Zombieland. It was a totally refreshing take on the genre and so well done.&&And Oldboy, obviously.&&I Saw the Devil and The Wailing.&&I loved Thirst, vampire movie directed by Park Chan Wook. &&There ya' go, Or Smallpox blankets gone wrong!&&Why couldn't you make the natives zombies? Both ideas are sweet.&&It was brilliant wasn’t it? The fact that it was mostly on the train, gave the claustrophobic feeling, and it wasn’t dragged out for weeks/months and everything was just one day. Characters were awesome too, except for that shitty “old lady” with the most pathetic old person makeup. &&It was good, but it could've been better. The end was really frustrating because things could have gone much better if not for some very dumb decisions made during the last fight sequence.&&I liked how they took SFX scenes similar to World War Z but actually did them *right*.&&Didn't r/movies hate Train to Busan for being generic.&&Don’t know if you know but there was an Anime sequel named Seoul Station that was also released.&&Not sure if it still is, but Oldboy and Joint Security Area were on there for a long time.  Taegukgi as well, though that's not Park's.&&I know everyone loves Oldboy but I thought his performance in I Saw The Devil was absolutely stellar.&&Train to Busan should be on there unless the recently removed it. &&Honestly not all his fault. Seemed like he was told it’d be solely about his upcoming film as opposed to being as open-ended what the name suggests. &&But what happened *exactly*, in short? (there's thousands and thousands of comments in the thread linked below .. can't really go over them all)&&""Woody Harrelson"", aka Woody's PR agent, most likely as well.

Like that [one AMA disaster with ""Morgan Freeman""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/) and the [weird verification picture](https://i.imgur.com/BvitNsz.jpg).&&Ah, okay. &&I didn't see a single response on there from him. &&JFC what a mess and a friggin riot that ama is. For folks who don’t want to scan that ama, just look at u/iamwoodyharrelson comments&&I was thinking more like: Cab to Hotel.&&Rickshaw to Pyongyang&&Then starts the World War Z book's North Korean chapter lmao&&What about Bike to Incheon?&&Boat to Jejudo&&That is one fucked up movie.&&Thanks for the tip! I love having Shudder. &&... and the parallel movie happening at the same time as Train to Busan - Train to Mok-po (the lines split at Daejeon, you could have had another train leave from there just before they wrecked the joint).&&I assume he has had enough.&&Busan is like world war Z zombies. 28 zombies are just fucking terrifying in their own way&&That's not what I meant really. Just filled that raging zombie hole I had in my heart. &&Used to be, looks like I Saw the Devil is on Hulu and Memories of Murder is on Prime video now. Netflix does have Mother, Asura, Age of Shadows, and Train to Busan, all very good.  
edit: and Prime video also has The Handmaiden, The Man from Nowhere, and Nameless Gangster. Hulu has The Chaser (same director as The Wailing) and The Good/Bad/Weird.&&Yeah isnt that, like, the major theme of Shin-Godzilla? The fact that the Japanese government could have likely managed the threat when ""baby godzilla"" showed up, but because they are so mired in bureaucracy they allowed ""baby godzilla"" to literally evolve into a near-extinction level threat that nearly destroyed Japan? It was supposed to be a commentary.

&#x200B;

What the hell is American Shin-Godzilla about?&&Seriously wtf is this bullshit. I saw it uncut in theaters, who was the idiot in charge of making a cut version?&&In the same vein as Hereditary?&&The Raid 1 & 2 are masterpieces. Both came to my local theater (Australian town), which was awesome.

I was the only one there, both times.&&That is sad. When I was in the UK, we went for the midnight screening of The Raid 2 and the theater was actually full so it's awesome to see everyone excited to watch a foreign film. Not that I need the subtitle anyway (I'm Malaysian, we understand Indonesian language most of the time).&&More like r/overlord.&&Check out the audio book version if you have a chance. So many amazing voice actors. From Nathan Fillion, Mark Hamill, Simon Pegg, even Martin Scorsese is in it.&&Yonkers was somewhat unbelievable though in my opinion. 

I mean, I think some artillery shells hitting masses of zombies isn’t going to be ineffective at all. I don’t care what anyone says, a shell shot from an M777 howitzer is going to kill several Zs. Zacks can’t start attacking when their head is that way and their arms are several yards to their right while their legs are torn up and their torso is several yards to their left. &&My SAW chattering die, motherfucker, die&&Is that like the American version of the phrase ""Dog's bollocks""?&&Holy crap this was what i thought of too! That Reeks&&THEON! His name is *Theon*

He may have been a fuck, but he was mostly just a stupid kid who couldn’t fit in with either culture&&In exchange for Orion, exactly&&Im sure theyll give an explaination in the movie...probably&&Yes. Giant crabs were once universally feared by man and animal alike until one day it was discovered that they had a weak point that could be attacked for massive damage. The rest is history. &&**RIDDDGEEEE RACERRRRRRRR**&&Now if you’ll excuse me I’m gonna go marathon all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies before I start my VC campaign.  Who knows, maybe I’ll be the opera singer.  &&[I wouldn't be surprised, the Jiangshi is a popular Chinese myth. It originates from undertakers carrying corpses at night with bamboo poles wedged under the corpse's armpits, which makes the corpse look like it's hopping as the poles flex and bend.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi)&&[Jiangshi (hard corpse) are known in the West as ""Chinese Vampires"" sometimes.](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/012/141/055/large/jean-vervelle-jiangshi.jpg?1533233360) It moves around by hopping rather than walking and his hands are always outstretched due to rigor mortis on his legs and hands. They are feral, fast and in some tales drink blood, in others drain souls. The talisman on their forehead is something sorcerers would use to control them. They can be escapes by throwing at them many small objects (usually rice) and they will be forced to count them.&&Wait, I'm like halfway through the book. There's a movie? &&I do like trains. Honestly I think trains are the coolest set pieces for action scenes. *Solo*, *Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter*, *Captain America*, level three or four of *Star Wars Shadows of the Empire*. Trains are dope.&&+1 for woochi. Blew my mind. Wish they would make a sequel.&&*I Saw the Devil* was so good, actually had to look away during one of the scenes&&Thank you. But ""Mother Inside Men"" are two separate movies, ""Mother"" and ""Inside Men"". 
&&Thanks for the reformatting, The Good the Bad and the Weird is a really great movie&&Thank you so much!!&&Not too sure actually. I saw it in a film festival a couple of weeks ago, but I think the movie is a year or two old so you'd hope it'd be out there!&&Nice!! :)
So excited for number 2! And I do agree, that when it comes to actual raw zombie movies this and train to bus an will be a breath of fresh air.
&&That's one I've been trying to find, but I don't think it's streaming on Netflix or Prime...any ideas where to watch for free?&&I would love this movie!&&The vilification and literal depiction of Natives as monsters has been a historically bad decision&&I actually hated the villain, he was such a dickbag that his character was ridiculous by the end.&&You can't have horror without dumb decisions.&&What did World War Z do wrong? It's been awhile since I saw that film.&&Oldboy's still on the Dutch Netflix at least&&AMAAR&&But, show some humility and go with the flow? If I remember correctly he was contractually obligated to do half an hour. Anybody could do that. Shoot easy the easy targets, collect your paycheck.. done

That's the only real reason I find him douchie in this scenario.&&The issue was that someone in the thread had accused him of crashing some high school after-prom party, chatting up a young girl up with sweet promises and smooth talk, taking her virginity, and then ghosting her, leaving her alone and devastated. This became the top comment in the thread, and redditors being redditors decided that the AMA was now an ""interrogate Woody about these allegations"" thread, where every question was derailed into trying to get him to respond to the allegations.

Woody tried to keep people on track and talking about his movie, and the rest is history. It's not like they were asking ""what's your favorite burrito filling?"" and he got pissy because it wasn't about his movie. This was some serious nightmare fuel for his PR team.&&i do believe that was the ama that sparked the change to what ama's were about, they were once literally ""ask me **ANYTHING**"", after that it became ""ask me anything about X, where X is subjects revolve entirely around the new movie im in and am advertising"" of course nobody cares about those things and so its often a pr account that has to ask the right questions so the celeb can answer them directly, ama is just a talk show now, minus the ""show"" part.

i miss the old ama where the top voted questions were expected to be answered.&&People telling this story always leave out the most important detail: the top rated comment was a lengthy made up story about woody harrelson stealing a teenagers prom date and having sex with her. Anyone would be salty if they were accused of something like that.&&This was the worst received part at the time :
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nijr7/

But it was just that and tons of not answering anything and asking to stick to talking about the movie. &&Basically he wouldn't answer anything that didn't pertain exactly to Rampart; consequently, he was collectively shit upon by reddit.&&I don't remember it exactly, but basically someone was all like, 'Hey Woody, do remember fucking my teenage mom or aunt in highschool?  I always wondered if you were my dad or uncle?'

It was a beautiful car crash&&Being an AMA folks tried asking all kinds of questions and he kept trying to steer the conversation back to Rampart, sometimes aggressively. &&He wouldn't really dig into anything that wasn't about Rampart, left a lot of Rampart-unrelated questions unanswered, sometimes literally saying something to the effect of ""can we get back to Rampart?"". This obviously [enrages the Redditeurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nijr7/), who, in turn, began to make passive aggressive comments and get sardonic about it. As such, it's now known as an iconic AMADisaster.&&In short, somebody accused Woody of having sex with his (then) 17 year old cousin which then became the top comment. &&Damn it Bill Cosby.&&**BWAAAAAAAM**

Best make The Evil some evil ghost from theirs beliefs.&&I think if they work in the context of the characters then it can be effective, in Green Room every character is making decisions that follow their own logic, and even realise it's fucking stupid.

And redditors lost their minds, mostly because they were angry about this imagined scenario of some celebrity stealing their girl. &&It got particularly salacious because the person who asked the question used a bunch of gifs to enhance their points and told the story in an interesting enough manner to get everyone believing them, and taking Woody's unwillingness to engage as proof he was a rapist.&&nowhere in the post does it say the girl was 17 or the OP's cousin...

And redditors lost their minds. &&I'm pretty sure even the people who came up with the idea of doing an AMA didn't know what it stood for. I have a feeling no one (with any influence) on the main ""team"" per se knew it, and only vaguely heard about it through word of mouth and without any prior research, just decided to go with it thinking it'd be good for publicity.

I get where /u/Butt_y_though is coming from, I'm inclined to agree with his post. But playing devil's advocate, it's not unreasonable for him to not talk about things unrelated to what he was expecting. It's like imagine if some big name magazine agreed to interview him under the premise that it would be solely about the movie. And then the interviewer comes out and starts asking him all this personal stuff that are completely unrelated to what he was expecting.&&Do you guys not remember that the top question was an allegation of a questionable sexual encounter he supposedly had with a young girl and a lot of the follow up responses were about that too.

So in every other form, totally brutal for Woody. &&Especially when celebrities are taught to be careful with what they say, as things can be taken out of context. So the topic of his questions completely devolved and he was addressing a mass of redditors, some of who definitely were trying to cheekily get him to say something bad. &&""Lets focus on the film people"" is still a funny quote and the AMA was unsatisfying beyond that, but a large portion of why it became so disastrous kinda lies with reddit deciding a gif-ladden, eye-catching story proved a man was a date rapist.

The story of Dick Cheney, the most powerful Vice President in history, and how his policies changed the world as we know it.

**Release Date:**

December 21, 2018

**Director:**

Adam McKay ('The Big Short', 'Step Brothers', 'Talladegha Nights')&&Christian Bale got into character by shooting people in the face and trying to start a war in the Middle East.&&Steve Carell as... DONALD RUMSFELD? Ok, fuck it I'm in anyways.. &&I read the title...

Saw the picture...

Then had to look back to the title because I forgot who the actor was.


I'd say that's pretty effing good.&&First image of Christian Bale as Chevy Chase. &&[Vanity Fair link with an additional picture of Bale as a young Cheney.](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/christian-bale-dick-cheney-movie)

Eagerly waiting for an image of Sam Rockwell as Bush. &&Will there be a scene where Dick ""accidentally"" shoots a guy while out hunting with him? 🤔&&I'm Batman&&Wow, and to think under all that makeup it's Amy Adams. &&I heard Christian Bale really shot his friend in the face while hunting and had his heart replaced with a fake one to get real “method” in this role. Can’t wait to see it.&&Honestly speaking, Christian Bale is one of best actors of this generation. The guy is incredibly dedicated to his craft.&&[deleted]&&I love it.

Can’t wait for this. Wish they stuck with “Backseat” as the title, though.&&He looks like a older Richard Dreyfuss.&&the tasteful thiccness

&#x200B;&&I will watch anything with Sam Rockwell in it&&The Dick Knight Rises&&George W. , don't just stare at Rumsfeld's ass, eat it.&&Looks more like Sven Goran Eriksen 😂&&I thought he said that after American Psycho he was done playing serial killers...&&LOL Sam Rockwell is playing George W! perfect.&&Spoiler: It's not makeup. Yes that's how far Bale will go for a role.&&Stop posting dick pics!!!!
&&They really couldn't find a sixty year old actor to do this? They had to have Bale come in to make-up at four o clock every morning? He'll never get an Oscar this way.&&He could play an old Adam West. &&You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become Alfred&&I’m sorry but what the fuck.

So dedicated to his craft. From Machinist to Batman and now this? My goodness! The guy deserves all of the commendations he have.&&Holy crap he looks just like him. &&Now that's range, to go from Batman to Palpatine&&I hope they have a great scene with Dick Cheney trying to get reservations at Dorsia. &&This is the most Christian Bale thing ever&&Christian Bale, why have you done this?

Methinks Christian Bale as Dick Chaney is an excellent casting call.&&Dat cast&&Don't know for sure if Keanu Reeves is really an immortal but Christian Bale is certainly a shapeshifter.&&Christian Bale looks more like Chevy Chase here than Dick Cheney&&I honestly thought he was Chevy Chase&&This man literally morphs into whoever he needs to play. He truly is dedicated to his acting.&&His next role will be an anorexic teenage girl.&&I can't wait for him and Gary Oldman to team up and be the only 2 actors in an ensemble cast of 30.&&What's more impressive that he even got old for the role!&&Jesus, that absolute madman&&I'm glad we've got a maniac character actor like him.

...someone get me the bleach for my imagination....&&It's insane how dedicated Christian Bale is to each of his roles. He looks like a completely different person when the movie calls for it.

He'll have his heart removed to more closely resemble Dick Cheney.  I heard he even volunteered to do some waterboarding.&&He'll be ok, I heard he got a heart implant to get into character. &&> Christian Bale is going to have a heart attack

Wow he's really quite the method actor isn't he.&&so a regular Chevy Chase?&&Fat Brando!&&Sam Rockwell is playing Dubya I believe and I personally couldn't be happier about it, Bale will be a great Cheney, but Rockwell is gonna kill it.&&So it's a comedy about Dick Cheney?  Is Will Ferell in this?&&You need to watch Succession on HBO to see how good McKay is at developing a story around corrupt assholes.  I expect this to be no different.&&Oscar bait for sure. I'm in. &&Not like he had a choice.  Method requires full immersion.&&# MISSION ACCOMPLISHED&&Ah the Ole Fullmetal Alchemist method &&I can't wait to see him sign a plastic water bottle for waterboarding at the post credits!&&I always forget that Cheney shot someone in the face. And then chuckle about it for a second. Late night comedians had a field day with that one.

Even his ""best supporting actor"" win is less than he deserves.&&[deleted]&&What did they change it to?&&Well Dreyfus did play Dick in W.&&Sam Rockewell as GWB is going to be so good &&Now there's a reference to confuse the Americans&&Who&&I'm assuming the idea is that the film will show Cheney at many points in his adult life and they wanted the same actor for the whole thing. I'd rather this than the Moonlight tactic of having three people who couldn't look less alike playing the same character. &&Amen.  Sixty year old, overweight white actor with a true receding hairline.  Gee, thoser rare.  

Reminds me of Renee Zellweger gaining 40# and putting on a British accent, as though 35 year old slightly overweight British accesses are rare.  &&Probably one of the most evil and conniving influences ever to hold a power as VPOTUS.&&I'd actually like to see him play Scarlett Johanson in a biopic about her agent continuously casting her as minorities.

Honestly, my dream casting for silliness would be Johnny Depp playing Helena Bonham Carter as co-star in a biopic about Johnny Depp, directed by Tim Burton. Depp would be played by Helena Bonham Carter.

That's probably always been the case and I personally don't see anything wrong with it either. Actors aren't competing. Its not 'cheating'. 

And I'm sure in some cases, it may even be healthier than losing/gaining large amounts of weight in a very short period of time. &&actors nowdays probably drink more unicorn blood than necromancers&&I am sure Mac from always sunny was all natural....&&He was pretty much that in the Machinist in terms of looks.

Edit: for the unlearned https://youtu.be/Q6Fuxkinhug&&> Scarlett Johanson in a biopic about her agent continuously casting her as minorities

she is a minority tho...part jewish! /s&&I'd like some of what you're smoking, please.&&I get you're probably being facetious but that whole thing bugged me for the opposite reason of most;

She was cast as The Major in Ghost in the Shell; A story about trans-humanism  in a world where fully prosthetic bodies are commonplace (the original film even shows a copy of the Major's body in a store window) and ethnicity really matters very little. Even gender is of ambiguous importance, as one of the characters in the animated show quips she should switch to a male prosthetic model for the increased bulk and strength it's heavier mechanics provide.  

Meanwhile, the prevalent underlying theme of the anime is Nationalism. Whenever they refer to themselves, foreigners or refugees it's always framed in terms of their Nationality rather than race or ethnicity. This is driven home in the anime when a one off eccentric Texan billionaire is shown having eschewed humanoid bodies entirely for a black box with spider legs. Race is effectively a non-issue in the world of Ghost in the Shell both thematically and practically and it makes sense why. There was no need for the lead in the film to be or not to be Asian, as such the ""controversy"" seemed out of place to me.  I get the issue of minority actors not being offered enough roles so sure absolutely they could have given the role to one, but this wasn't a property that demanded that casting choice.

As for her intended role in Rub & Tug, her own production company was making that film; It was \*her\* movie. I wouldn't be surprised either if her being cast in it was part of the deal to get investors to sign off on it. With her pulling out, I doubt the film will even still get made. The outrage about her taking that role seemed not only silly, \*the entire point of acting is to play something you are not\*, but self defeating as well..&&No, Bonham Carter pays Burton. Eva Green plays Depp.&&And as per Burton's usualness, Carter as Depp would bang Depp as Carter.

Full penetration. Out doing the biopic, full penetration, biopic, penetration, biopic, penetration, biopic, full penetration until one of them just sorta gets an Oscar.&&> Honestly, my dream casting for silliness would be Johnny Depp playing Helena Bonham Carter as co-star in a biopic about Johnny Depp, directed by Tim Burton. Depp would be played by Helena Bonham Carter.

You jest, but I would pay money to see that actually happen.&&Christian Bale as Christian Bale, watch him implode trying to get inside his own head&&Yep, immediate thought. It was really disturbing. Like Andersonville. &&Or Rescue Dawn! iirc he lost all the weight before filming began and they filmed the scenes essentially in reverse order so he could gain it back during filming. &&Oooh... Could be a good movie. You could still use Russia, and have some modern General Ripper convinced that Russia is trying to contaminate our water with flouride and make our frogs gay or something, have him go full on conspiracy theorist. They'd find his insane posts on weird underground forums.

Kinda sad but with the current political climate you could still have it be a nuclear threat between the US and Russia and it's somewhat believable and relevant. Same story, same nukes, better technology. Shit, they could literally just make it color and replace all of USSR references with Russia.&&I would see this film. &&No, but when they go on T.V. and interviews and just talk about how they worked out hard and dieted and packed on 25 pounds of lean muscle in 6 months and you can do...that's a little fucked up.

You look at DDL, widely regarded by many as the greatest actor ever, and see that pretty much every role he takes is serious and a contender for an Oscar. 

Bale will put on incredible performances like in The Fighter, American Hustle and The Big Short. Then he’ll come out and do Terminator: Salvation and Exodus. &&That's like calling a painters use of perspective a gimmick. You could still be right though.&&Fuck I broke my time machine&&Yes.

Even Batou, who was supposed to be a brain in a human shaped walking tank of a robot body - formerly known for  trying to convince Motoko to swap to a male body for the additional mass and horsepower -  was just a normal biological human for the live action.

The outrage about her taking that role seemed not only silly, *the entire point of acting is to play something you are not*, but self defeating as well..

Except that trans people have been fighting for decades to overcome the image of all trans women as ""men in dresses"" (ie often portrayed as obvious men with primarily masculine bodies and secondary sex characteristics, doing the minimum of clothes and makeup to appear feminine) and, correspondingly, an image of trans men (when they even appear) as fairly androgenous but still clearly women wearing men's clothes and trying to push their voices down. Casting a trans person with a cis actor who is their AAB gender is tone deaf at best, and at worst (if done without utmost care for a careful depiction) extremely harmful.

Moreover, what was more upsetting to the trans community was that there was a significant rumor for a long while that the film was going to depict the main character, who in real life was a straight, trans man who went through hell for who he was, as a cis lesbian woman, which is horribly disrespectful to him in every way. Changing a fact or facet of a real person for a fictional portrayal is a necessary evil that happens all the time, but when that change coincides with real life erasure, it is incredibly harmful.

What really brought it to a fervor though was all of the trans actors in Hollywood who came forward as a result to talk about how they had been told they would be cast for trans roles, how impossible it is in Hollywood for a trans person to portray a cis person. Turning around and giving a trans role to a cis woman then became an act of outright hypocrisy and double standard.

Yes, the film not being made and not telling a trans story is a tragedy, and appears self defeating. But there's always the potential for another, less problematic trans film in the future. Better that we not get this film and fail to push our acceptance forward than that it be made poorly and set us back. &&The real conundrum is what weight he'll pick.&&Opposite DDL as DDL? Talk about an ensemble&&I'll fight you.&&I feel like most actors are pretty up-front about the fact that it isn't that easy for everyone.  They have the money for trainers, nutritionists, and supplements.  Plus the time to do it every day since it is literally their job.

I love this quote about it:

“Look, it’s not that hard. All you need to do is lift weights six days a week, stop drinking alcohol, don’t eat anything after 7 p.m., don’t eat any carbs or sugar at all, in fact just don’t eat anything you like, get the personal trainer from Magic Mike, sleep nine hours a night, run three miles a day, and have a studio pay for the whole thing over a six to seven month span. I don’t know why everyone’s not doing this. It’s a super realistic lifestyle and an appropriate body image to compare oneself to. #hollywood.”

But when the studio pays for one of the best personal trainers in the world, someone makes your entire diet plan and a personal chef cooks it for you, you can literally treat going to the gym as a full time job and can afford to get 9 hours of sleep every night, then its totally possible to do it 'naturally'.

Jews also worked with black artists in music (before it was legal/feasible for artists especially black artists to manage and produce their own music) and other similar areas- sometimes this worked out great sometimes it was just taking advantage of each other. The rise of Malcolm x and the radical Muslim movement among African Americans really froze that relationship though.&&That's just Lenny Kravitz working his magic.&&There's definitely a history there, relations during the [Civil Rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American%E2%80%93Jewish_relations#Civil_rights_movement) probably being the high point. &&I acknowledged this in another reply. As I said there; The GitS franchise has somewhat reinvented itself with each adaptation being it's own thing; As such a more traditional scifi-action film set in the GitS world isn't out of the question and the material could absolutely support a fun movie in that vein. 

Personally I'd view it as a bit of a waste; I've always been fascinated by the questions the series raises and love it's various takes on transhumanism. Even so an action-focused entry is not anathema to the spirit of a franchise that has shown a willingness to reshape itself with every new entry. Having a slambang live action popcornflick wouldn't diminish the depth of the other entries any and might have even introduced them to more wouldbe fans. The issue is, as you said, what they ended up making just just plain.. dull. They did nothing to take advantage of what the franchise material offers even as a popcorn action flick and that really is a shame. 

To be clear I'm not defending the live action film as a film. I don't hate it, I found it so dull personally that I really came out with little more than apathy towards it really. All my comment was discussing was the casting of Scarjo, which I thought was utterly fine, and how I found the accusation of her casting being a whitewashing of the property to be a thorough misunderstanding of the material.&&I highly recommend it. Thing to keep in mind about GiTs is each adaptation of the property is different; The original film is a Blade Runner-esque experience that has a pretty thin plot when you get down to it, but that's by design. It's really more about symbolism, and the philosophy behind the questions it raises. The sequel (the real sequel, Innocence) takes this route even further, though not to as much praise as the original.

  Meanwhile the original anime has a lot in common with police procedural in it's structure but once again uses that framework to explore various moral and philosophical questions associated with trans-humanism, with underpinning explorations of nationalism (from a very Japanese perspective). The original Manga is once again very different in the material it tackles along with having a far different tone than the other iterations (For example.. Major Kusanagi has a side gig in the manga where she makes money doing lesbian orgy cam shows with her roommates. yeah.)

The newest adaptation of the series, Rises, changes things yet again; this time giving the Major a more fully fleshed out backstory and going for a seemingly more grounded narrative (disclaimer; I haven't watched this one entirely yet). Other iterations have left her background more ambiguous; my favorite of these being in the anime Second Gig.

All in all I highly recommend giving the series a shot, or at the very least the original film. Especially if you find the concept of trans-humanism interesting. That said I can see how someone not interested in the concepts would find it boring, it's not an action focused franchise.&&I highly recommend you give Gits Stand Alone Complex (the series) a try. Much more approachable than the movie and closer to the manga. &&The movie would consist of him going from 90 pounds to appearing on ""my 600 lb life"". &&He left out the first step which is “cultivate mass”&&Yea but he's (understandably) leaving out the drugs part&&>a pound of muscle per week


It's not going to be lean muscle mass though. You'd probably have to bulk quite considerably with it.&&Nothing about that method is natural lol&&No, it's not. And no it can't. 

You don't need someone to do your diet plan for you. There are countless YouTubers who lay that out, and it's pretty easy: eggs, chicken, fish, vegetables, with 1.5ish grams of protein per pound. 

You get a decent workout routine, go to the gym after work and prepare your own meals. You also don't *need* 9 hours of sleep. That kind of routine and lifestyle is easily achievable by most people and tons of people do it. But you don't end up looking like Christian Bale in American Psycho or Gerard Butler in 300 or The Rock...ever. 

And yeah, *maybe* you can put on a pound a week, but it's not gonna be all muscle and you aren't going to be shredded with low body fat. After you put on that 25 pounds of muscle, you need to lean out to the extent where your abs are fully visible and you see your lower ab veins. &&Whats the hardest for me when i try to gain lean muscle mass is getting a good 6 to 8 hours sleep..i work out pretty good,eat clean but never got the time to sleep well so my gains is always slow and sometime plateuaed&&And, depending on who you are, you can make millions.

Still I think Bale's been one of the best actors alive since his performance in American Psycho. Can't imagine anyone coming close to being able to handle that role in such an amazing movie.&&are there any other actors that are like DDL? Like only do a movie ever 3 years or so?

Because i'd bet a lot of money they're paid a hell of a lot less than DDL. DDL is paid so much as he is one of the greatest of all time and people will go see him in any movie. his name adds a lot to a movie.

Bale is great, but he's not that. No one says they're going to see the new Christian bale movie.

"Scott Wilson, Actor in 'The Walking Dead' and 'In Cold Blood,' Dies at 76",37096,9m1rm9,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-wilson-dead-walking-dead-cold-blood-actor-was-76-1126197?utm_source=twitter&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral,978,1538878906.0,,"So, they announced Hershel’s cameo today at Comic Con and then he passed away? 

Did I read that correctly?&&Aw man, I met him and gave him a hug at a con once.  Really nice guy&&That's a shame. Was my favorite character on the walking dead and I think the show took a noticeable dip in quality when they wrote his character off&&Fuck, he's one of my favorite character actors. Had a long and great career starting with In the Heat of the Night and then In Cold Blood, The Great Gatsby, The Right Stuff, Exorcist III, and recently The Walking Dead, Hostiles and OA!  
  
Cannot recommend The Ninth Configuration enough to those who haven't seen it. From the author of The Exorcist and one of the most batshit insane mainstream movies of the 80's! Words cannot do enough justice for it.
  &&I think they just announced he's coming back for a cameo in this season of TWD today as well.. such unfortunate timing

F &&He was one of the last characters I really connected with on the show. A good role model who placed values and beliefs ahead of his actions.  The character reminds me of my grandad who died in the hospital after I found him on the floor of his home in April of this year. Everyone could use a Hershel Green in their life. 

Not sure why I’m sharing that but yeah. Rip him and I’m very sorry to the family. I’m really happy to hear he will get one last appearance. &&Only watched this guy yesterday in the X Files.. good actor. RIP&&Back when he played Judd in “Shiloh” I used to hate this guy, and then fell in love with his character as Hershel in WD; the sign of a quality actor. RIP.&&Oh man, Rest In Peace. He was a phenomenal actor and one of my highlights of the Walking Dead. &&I always enjoyed when he was on screen, he was a joy to watch, a real bright spot in the Walking Dead when it was in rough spots.&&That’s sad. I met him once while I was working as a driver at a convention. I was taking a break, having a slice of pizza and he came up to me, sat down, and asked he could have a slice too. We just sat there and quietly (and tiredly) ate pizza together. &&Was he also in The Host? &&I was so sad to hear about this, he was mine and my husband’s favorite character on TWD and we had the pleasure to meet him earlier this year. He was so nice and talked to us for a while at the meet and greet, then even remembered us later at the photo op! &&He had that infinite ammo cheat on during the barn scene&&Fuck cancer&&Dang. He was such a good actor.  RIP buddy &&If you’re reading this and have never seen “Behind the Mask” Watch that movie.   He plays a retired slasher killer (think Michael Meyers) mentoring an up and coming one during the satire bits of the movie.  It’s fucking amazing.  &&He was such a badass on CSI&&In the OA as well&&That dude kicked Shiloh though. &&That's awful :( was one of the best characters on TWD&&F&&Me and my mom took a picture with him a couple years ago. I was hesitant since he was famous and didn’t wanna bother him. My mom went up and asked for a pic his family was so wonderful and welcoming. May he Rest In Peace. I will miss him. &&I always associate him with the movie The Way of the Gun.&&Fucking shame. To add more fuel to the fire: I saw him in *Hostiles* earlier this year and his character only shows up for like five minutes but leaves an impression as a real bastard. Of course he gets what's coming to him but still strange to see that happen.

RIP.&&I'll always remember his Justified episode.  One of my favorites, loved his character.  A real loss in talent.&&Aw man. Rip&& That moment in the prison was an extremely powerful moment in TWD. This sucks. &&He also played Governor Wallace in one of my favorites, Young Guns 2.   I didn’t realize this until recently.   &&Worked with him when I worked on that TV show Damien. 

He was a really good guy and was tough as nails.&&Scott Wilson was born in my hometown, Thomasville Georgia. When I was in high school, TWD was at its high point. He came to our school, walked the halls, sat in on classes and towards the end of the day he gave us a little speech in our auditorium and afterwords, he shook my hand and took a minute to talk to my group of friends I was with. The conversation wasn't important at all but the time he took to have it was. Thanks Scott, you were a great guy. We'll miss you 
&&First his leg and now this.... Terrible&&He also was in the Great Gatsby!&&I worked with Mr. Wilson backstage at a Comic Con, and I tell the story of how sweet he was often. Backstage crew have a quick turnover between panelists, so we often run around for the better part of 12 hours, with few breaks, and very little food and water. Mr. Wilson recognized our ravenous faces, left the backstage area, making us all nervous because his showtime to go on stage was coming up quickly, only to arrive with minutes to spare with a pizza for the stage/AV/lighting crews. I had never had a panelist do that before, and haven’t had one do it since. Such a kind man, through and through. &&Rest In Peace Herschel.&&Aww man!  He played Scott Crossfield in ""The Right Stuff.""&&Man, RIP


It always feels weird when I see an older celebrity die, then realize that they've been nearing the normal lifespan cap for a while. They just happen to be old, and most baby boomers are in their 70s, which on average is the oldest people reach. 



It's like, every year after is a gift. I still can't believe that Betty White, Harry Belafonte, Mel Brooks, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, and Sidney Poitier are still alive. 81 for women and 76 for men. &&I never knew he had Leukemia.  Personally, he still had some good years ahead of him, his cool demeanor can instantly turn to a can of ass whipping when he needs to.  Smooth voiced and underrated.  RIP Scott.&&Scott Wilson was also great in a little indie movie called Junebug, with Amy Adams. &&Met him at steel City con. Sat outside the hotel and smoked a cigar with us fans. Later went up to him just to let him know a really under appreciated film called the way of the gun was one of my favorite and I really enjoyed him in it. He seemed to happy to have some one bring up a lesser known role and shook my hand. One of the best interactions I've ever had at a con. RIP man. You were a great actor.&&I haven't watched Walking Dead in years, but when i did, Grandad and his hot grandaughter with a farm were great viewing. &&Gutted. 😢😭&&Was probably my favourite character in the show. They really nailed his character and the change he goes through from season 2 to season 4

Rest in peace&&Met him in 2014 at walker stalker con in ATL, sweetest guy ever. This really ruined my day. Rest in peace my dude.&&I quit watching when they killed him. Rip ole dude.&&Scott Wilson was super sweet and fun. After meeting a few people at a con once, I was invited for drinks afterwards and had the pleasure of sitting next to Scott. He was exactly like you would expect a grandpa figure to be; kind, helpful, wise, and filled with stories about cats lol.

I’ll share my favorite story from that evening; it was how he got a particular troublemaker cat to learn to stay off his furniture. He had tried everything, and nothing was deterring this cat from getting on (or tearing up) his nice couch. So he put scotch tape, sticky side up, all over and around his couch, and sprinkled it with pepper. He went on to describe the hilarity as the cat struggled with immense difficulty to get the tape off after it made the mistake of approaching the couch.

As the days went on, he used less and less scotch tape, but more slowly he would decrease the amount of pepper he sprinkled. The cat quickly learned to avoid the couch for fear of invisible tape, and the smell of pepper helped to communicate it. Anytime he wanted to deter the car away from something, he could just sprinkle pepper around it. 

While I didnt know Scott personally, I had a great time meeting him. He definitely made all of us laugh that evening, and I believe he will be missed dearly by those who were close to him. 
RIP Scott&&Scott Wilson was brilliant - so underrated!

Herschel was my fave character. The man with unlimited ammo!

I know it was 5 years ago - bit still haven't gotten over the Governer doing him in.

Now he's really gone - it's truly sad.  He will be missed. 

RIP mate. &&I drove him from his home for a period of time. He lived very quaint country style. His persona from TWD is his real persona. Good hearted dude https://imgur.com/vYGd9ZH.jpg&&Not again !&&At first glance, I thought the caption said Scott Wilson dead in cold blood... RIP. I hope his family, friends, and fans find peace.  &&RIP  
  
He played Hershel, one of my favorite characters on *The Walking Dead*.&&Such a wonderful man, really brought some great acting to the table. Seemed like a genuinely nice and warm individual. He’ll be missed.&&This is like grieving for him all over again. Very talented actor. I absolutely loved him as Herschel.

&#x200B;&&He was a fine actor and from all accounts a good guy.

He had a small but important part in ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron.  Truly heartbreaking,  and apparently the producers said that he was the only person they wanted for the part. 

RIP. &&R.I.P. Hershel.&&RIP Hershal, truly one of the best characters in the show&&It was sad enough seeing him die as Hershel... this is just too much.&&Hey came into my job a couple times a few years ago. He was an awesome guy..&&And 'Young Guns II'. RIP&&Hershel became one of my favorite characters in TV history. I feel for his family and fans. Scott, you made a difference in my life when i needed ot most. I thank you.&&🌹🍺🇦🇺&&RIP Hershell&&Nowadays you breathe, you risk your life :( &&Met him earlier this year and he couldn’t have been a kinder man. We shared a laugh and he high-fived my mum. His hug was warm and his smile infectious. Very sad news to wake up to. &&No! I really liked that guy :(&&Still too young&&[Was also George Wilson in the 1974 version of Great Gatsby with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934113/)&&The Ninth Configuration was some crazy shit. I felt like Shutter Island was a remake of it.&&That is such a shame.  I met him a few years ago and he was just s sweet person.  He hugged my kids and then asked if I wanted a hug too.  Rest well, sir. &&He was one of the best characters... &&Met him at the ATL airport once, took time to take individual pics with a bunch of boots headed to MOS school in Pensacola, seemed like a great guy and terrific actor. RIP. &&Looks like that shotgun finally ran out of ammo. RIP&&I met Scott at a con a few years back, and he was an absolute sweetheart. RIP&&He was such a loveable individual in his roles, I'm sure he was just as loveable off set. How terrible and sad. :(&&I met Scott at Montreal comic con when TWD was at peak popularity. Such a sweet sweet and funny man. RIP&&""In Cold Blood"", talk about a feel-good film. /s    It's probably one of the most bleak movies I can think of.   You know there were depressed people leaving the movie theatre after watching that one.  

Anyhow, I didn't realize until now that he played Robert Blake's partner in that movie.   &&Jesus Christ I'm stoned and for the longest time that title looked like it said he was killed in cold blood at 76 witch I thought was just wild as a mfer&&#ripscottwilson I loved him on The walking Dead! My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his loved ones!!!&&Man I cried really hard when he died in twd&&I had the distinct pleasure of moderating four panels with him at a few cons. He was an absolute gentleman with a very kind heart. RIP my friend.&&He was so good at playing Herschel. He really portrayed his kind-heartedness perfectly. He was a great actor. &&Like 15 years ago I watched Shiloh with my grandmother, a few weeks later she comes back from a funeral somewhere in Georgia with his autograph for me written on a napkin. I always loved him on TWD too. RIP&&Herschelllllll!!!! Noooo :(&&Watched The Ninth Configuration just the other day. Fantastic performance.&&F&&[deleted]&&I recognized him instantly on the set of Bosch and was soooo star struck. But I think I played it cool, although I think he noticed that I recognized him instantly.&&Sad to hear it, just saw him in Bosch.&&Man this is so fucked, they just announced he's coming back to the show and the guy literally dies IRL minutes later... RIP, one of the best characters the show ever had.&&He played the Governor on Young Guns 2&&I don't even watch walking dead, but that dude was a great actor. RIP my man&&Not Herschel. In a world gone to shit, he was what was needed.&&I was worried a sec his mom was still alive, but she passed last year.  Glad she doesn't have to deal with burying him.&&Hershel was the first fictional character I really connected with and cared about as a 12 year-old back when the Walking Dead was first airing. Not sure why, but I loved the character and became a huge fan of Scott Wilson. He was my first favorite actor.

I was devastated when Hershel was killed off. I nearly stopped watching TWD, but I grew to understood the reasoning for the character's death (I finally gave up on the show a couple years later). Hearing of his character's upcoming return is interesting, but it might just make me sad to watch. 

I'm 19 now, a sophomore in college, and I don't often think of Hershel, TWD, or Scott Wilson, but I'm really bummed to hear of his death. The sadness I felt for Hershel when I was 13 I now feel on a much realer level for Scott. RIP man.&&Now he can star in the literally dead. *ba-boom tsh*&&Sad to hear. He seemed like such a great guy. &&This makes me so damn sad.  What a great actor.&&Also great in ""Junebug"" from 2005.&&I don't even have anything clever to say. It's heartbreaking.&&Ninth Configuration - Cutshaw. Genius. &&This made me cry. He was such a sweet guy, and so talented. I LOVED him in Junebug. :( &&People do not understand how dedicated you have to be to your characters but thats just showbiz baby. &&That’s sad, I really liked him. &&This guy was Pa in Judge Dredd the movie too, crazy good acting.&&RIP Mr Wilson&&Damn. I really loved his role as Dick Hicock in 'In Cold Blood'. He also had a role as the stoic sheriff in 'Clay Pigeons' (1998) that's also stuck with me.&&RIP Scott, haven't watched the walking dead but this sucks. Best wishes to his family.&&nooooo....

Also loved him in The Great Gatsby. 

Godspeed, good sir. You will surely be missed. 

:’(&&Oh no&&Rest In Peace. &&RIP&&We all got jobs to do.&&Oh, no!!! Lewis done some swears!!!!&&Aw man. This makes me sad&&Wow a true bummer. I met him at comic con a couple years back.

Losing talented people sucks.&&One of the best characters on TWD.&&Rest In Peace &&F&&How did he die? The article doesn't state the cause.&&Westu hál. Ferðu, Scott, Ferðu.&&Holy shit. I loved him. &&Damn that's unfortunate&&Way sad!! Rest In Peace brother &&😭&&RIP&&Who gets to inherit his Legendary High Capacity Shotgun?&&So there was no hope for Hershel after all, even if The Governor spared his life.&&He was amazing in “In Cold Blood.” Scott Wilson, may you Rest In Peace. You were an amazing actor and humble person. I first saw you work in college. That just shows the level of your work that we study you at the graduate level. Thank you Mr. Wilson, we’ll miss you. &&F&&Watching The Walking Dead with my family we always said he was our favourite character and always the highlight of the show. Rest in peace Scott you will be missed.&&Awww fuck. RIP, my man- I'll remember the shotgun-zombie-smackdown for the rest of my days. Maybe I'll see you there, you wisdom-and-watch dispensing badass. &&Rip&&F&&Loved him in The Ninth Configuration https://youtu.be/S9i-fzlJSs4 he was one of the best actors on The Walking Dead may he rest in peace.&&So sad😔&&Loved him in the 9th configuration&&R.I.P.&&Yup. And apparently making a zombie joke about it gets you a ban on twd sub lol&&Sadly, yes.&&From my understanding they already filmed it.&&I've got a feeling it's what he wanted as he had been battling cancer so he knew he was going to go eventually.&&Spaghetti Tuesday on Wednesday canceled :,(&&Well shit that’s insane timing o.O &&Well I mean obviously he has his parts ready to go. But man that sucks big time. &&Damn, Greg Nicotero is starting to kill off people in real life too. &&Life comes at you fast&&Ran into him at the airport once when he was leaving ComicCon. He took a picture with me for my kids. He was a super nice man. Told me that the Governor was there as well. They were flying together. He was on the phone though and I did not want to bother him. Liked Herschel a lot better anyway.&&Met him at a gas station once. I did a quick double take and he just kinda chuckled at me. We chatted for a few about the Walking Dead, and he was a super nice, genuine dude. Sad that he's passed. &&Have other people you've hugged before died?  You may be discovering your super power&&He’s from my home town and actually came to speak at my school. A friend of my parents were neighbors with him. I also remember he became very emotional and started crying when asked about his experience in our town. He also stuck around to talk to some of us theater kids 
Really genuine, modest guy. &&Yeah, I stopped watching it shortly after his departure.  An older character who was a fighter mentally and physically, who didn't despair, was inspiring.&&Yeah Hershel was the man. I think his death actually kind of made sense because he was old and more vulnerable so it actually had a lot of weight to it. He was easily the best character in those couple of seasons.&&What.  How could you say it was more than Dale?&&>>""When they wrote his character off""

Except they didn't 'write his character off,' he died exactly when he was supposed to&&his character was actually supposed to die when they initially left the farm they continued his character arc because of the quality that Scott Wilson brought to the character&&I haven't read any issues since about 160, but the comics also take a noticable dip in quality after Hershel leaves. Not necessarily because of his character though.&&To be fair there was also a noticeable dip in quality when they wrote him and his farm on. Not because of the character but because of the setting.&&Ehhhhh, while he was a good character and actor, the entire second season was a long and dull appetizer for what was to come&&In retrospect I think that was the episode after that I noticed the show get aimless &&Dude agreed...: &&That amazing episode when everyone is sick and he is on the edge of despair gets me. But he holds it together. 

Great actor, RIP. &&Agreed. I’m not excited about this upcoming season at all. If it hadn’t already jumped the shark several seasons back, it did for sure when they killed off Carl.&&Check him out in ""Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon"". It's a (half) mockumentary where Scott plays a retired serial killer, and is fantastic. Perfect Halloween time movie. :) &&Seconded on *The Ninth Configuration*. That movie is absolutely nuts in the best way possible. A really good companion piece to both *The Exorcist* and *Exorcist III* as well. &&My first memory of him was Exorcist III. Just totally creeped me out and fit as the perfect example of an insane asylum doctor. 

>That man in the isolation tank, you know... the one you looked in on. 

BRILLIANT!&&Don't forget *The Host* (2006) - Scott Wilson was in Bong Joon-ho movies before it was the hip, cool thing to do.

Just a great actor. &&He was also in The Way of the Gun too. That's where I most recently remembered him before TWD.&&I always remember him as Catherine’s dad on CSI&&> At New York Comic-Con 2018, Walking Dead showrunner Angela Kang announced that Wilson would reprise his role as Hershel in season nine — which premieres Sunday — though she offered no word on the timing of his appearance or how many episodes in which he was slated to appear. However, sources have confirmed that Wilson had filmed some scenes. The announcement was made a little more than an hour before news of Wilson's passing spread on social media.

&&They probably still have the prop head &&How would a cameo even work with Herschel?&&> Everyone could use a Hershel Green in their life.

Ain't this the truth. He brought so much humanity to that show.&&I wish you and your grandad peace. &&Hershel reminded me of my Grandad for the same reasons. Became my favorite character because of that really.&&Hershel was the only reason I survived the loss of Dale.

&&That's what I associate him with. He was all over the place character acting-wise, and that's such a cool quality to have for an actor, to me&&I can't believe I never made that connection before. I loved the ""Shiloh"" books and movies as a kid.&&Omfg he was Judd ;-;&&He will always be Judd to me.&&Nothing quite as real as sharing a meal with another person yknow? Even if it's unintentional- real connection. &&Yeah, he's the guy at the beginning who tells the other guy to dump the stuff down the drain. I was literally just watching that yesterday and thought, ""Hey, I recognize that guy from somewhere."" (Somewhere being Walking Dead--and apparently In Cold Blood, but I saw that a long time ago). RIP.&&The Korean monster movie?&&Pour it down the drain!&&Damn, that scene was powerful. You could tell he was ready to go down swinging for what the walkers did to his wife and home.&&He must of had that solid snake bandanna in his pocket or something. &&F&&Yeah aren’t they in the middle of filming season 2? Wonder what they’re gonna do. &&Oh my God I didn’t even think of this :( fuck cancer &&I forgot all about this movie until now&&F&&F&&F&&He was so damn good in that.  I mean everyone was, but even in that field he stood out.&&Oh shit I forgot about this movie. Trailers made me want to see it so badly, but it fell off my radar and I never got around to it. Good?&&Best foot chase in TV history in that episode.&&The leg seems insignificant compared to his head..&&Quite a key role too, without giving away spoilers.  Much younger but still recognisable.&&To be honest...I thought it was Richard Dryfuss (sp?) from the photo for about 5 glances in my timelines on different apps. I have never associated them with each other before, so really threw me off &&I met him a few years ago. He was super nice and friendly. &&I kept watching but the show was never the same and I never cared when any other characters were killed off. &&Having a small cameo in a flashback is hardly coming back to the show.. &&Fuck I'm old&&Cancer&&I’m going to hell for laughing at that one. 🔥 &&Tell a joke, you risk your life....&&Using humor to deal with a dark situation?!
Humans would never do that!
/s&&One foot in the grave, and the other sawed off.&&To be fair, their mods have been super salty and super butthurt the last few years since the only people that are left are the ultra die-hard fans after 3/4 stopped watching that show when it turned into hot garbage.&&Meh, the WD should have called it quits two years ago.&&Something about him now being Hershel Walker?&&Testing this atm&&LOL&&No fun allowed on a fandom sub wow I'm so surprised&&What?&&Was it the one about him joining the zombies and becoming a great player for their football team?&&Hold my beer!&&Ooh ooh! I'm next!&&Brb&&Oof&&They could have just cut off his leg to prevent this.&&Just try to imagine what mods who do this shit on reddit are like irl

Or just a reddit mod irl&&The mods there are the biggest ban-happy snowflakes I've ever seen, so makes complete sense&&Sounds like they've got some brain dead mods over there...&&Reddit Mods are the softest people on the planet&&Can confirm. Am now banned from r/thewalkingdead&&That sub and show are deader than the zombies.&&Sometimes being a hero means being hated. &&Brb gonna get myself banned&&Take my upvote, that’s my laugh of the day gone.&&Or are they going weekend at Bernie's on him and saying it was already filmed?&&I haven't watched it in a while. If I remember correctly Hershel >!got decapitated !< so how's a cameo happening?&&>I've got a feeling it's what he wanted

Avoiding Comic Con? &&I sat next to him in a movie theater to see gravity in 3D haha (The Grove LA.) I briefly talked with him after and he indeed was super nice. &&I told him I was really really sad when his character died and he iust went ""yeah me too :("" &&The show got waaaaaaay worse later on, sad about his passing though, he was supposed to come back for a flashback or something in an upcoming episode&&he also had that crazy shotgun with 100 shells in it&&And spiritually. I liked that side of him.&&I’m with you. I haven’t watched since the season at the prison. Just wasn’t feeling it anymore. And I was bonkers for the show the first season. &&I kept thinking that he’d die from sickness while taking care of everyone else that was coughing and dying. The way he went shocked the hell out of me and I remember being pissed that Rick didn’t do something about it&&Thank you, I thought I’d read that wrong. I assumed Dale was *everyone’s* favorite character, let alone my own. He was always a voice of calm and reason in the show and never seemed to get too frantic or wide-eyed about any situation.&&Right time, wrong death. He got Tyreese's death, but his own comic death wouldn't have worked in the show because they wrote out most of his kids so you didn't have him finally breaking  as his son dies in the battle for the prison and begging the governor to shoot him.&&The comic spins its wheels for soooo long. They had like 30 issues where it feels like nothing is happening. I finally fell off.

Plus, I just always thought Negan was kind of lame. He just feels like a character that a high schooler would make up.&&Season 2 wasn't great but him and his family were the best thing about it. He was my favourite after they left the farm&&Yeah season 2 was terrible. I do find it funny how there are many comments about how good it was now when it really wasn't, like they are trying to preserve his legacy or something? The guy was a good actor but season 2 was a low point in the series.

Edit: oh no camped out in a barn with Dale was amazing, a masterpiece of a series. I'm not going to lie just because the guy died. He was good, the season wasn't.&&Getting rid of Carl kinda kills the future of the show, especially if Rick is also leaving. Rick and Carl *are* the show. &&Underrated movie.&&That was really insensitive of them to do it an hour before his death.  They should have done it at least 24 hours before.  &&So they've already filmed his cameo?&&Shiiit dude that was good. Dark, but good.  &&Maybe Rick dies and he meets Herschel and whoever else who died in the show in a white room smiling or something.&&Maggie Dream. &&Thank you. It was really hard to take him off the machine :( 

He told me he just wanted to go to sleep. Hope I did the right thing. &&Bill Murray in St. Vincent reminded me of my grandpa. I guess that says something about my family vs yours.&&Yes the Korean one. I would rather kill my self than ever watch a Stephanie Meyer adaptation &&Principal photography wrapped back in June.&&[deleted]&&Pretty solid stuff, it is. Does a lot right than it does wrong. Gorgeous, well acted and sincere even though the pacing leaves to be desired and the Native American characters deserved more scenes. Was like my #22 on my list for 2017.

It's on Netflix if you wanna give it a shot, though you might feel depressed after its done.&&Maybe he died to get out of having to go back on TWD. &&Try to get some sweet karma, you risk your life...&&The show so bad it killed the mods' senses of humor.&&lmao you say that as if redditors just don't like being edgy &&My friend died at work on a Friday.

I came in Monday before our morning muster. The loudmouth of the company came in with a really dark joke about my friend. It wasn't disrepectful. It wasn't horrible. I wish I could remember it. It was just really dark. 

And it made the pain of losing a friend seem like the world would still go on. I had to smile.  Have always appreciated dark humor after that. Definitely helped me cope with loss.&&""It's just a prank bro"" of bad events.&&The people joking and those excusing them are in no way emotionally affected by this man's death.  Stop giving cover to classless shitheads looking to make a joke about someone dying. &&Kinda reminds me of how the r/Southpark mods seem to be.

All I did a couple days ago was state my opinion on how the season 22 episodes were unoriginal, pointless in its toilet humor beyond South Park's comedic style, and too reminiscent of Family Guy-type writing (especially episode 2 which was just a rehash of the Catholic church episode way early on and filled with forced priest jokes and cum jokes). I even suggested topics Matt and Trey should cover instead

And people attacked me big time for it trying to justify it by misrepresenting my opinion and twisting my words.

And the night of episode 2 was just filled with endless priest molestation jokes. It was boring and tiresome

I have no idea why a lot of the fans on there have such a hard-on for the current season when I feel it's their worst. I actually loved the past few seasons and the changes the characters went through. &&You mean after the first season? It's just a soap opera with occasional zombies.&&So he's now in Minnesota? &&Considering the subject matter, it wouldn't necessarily be out of place.&&Maybe a flashback?&&Rick is most likely dying this season so he’ll probably have flashbacks. They announced that another dead character will make a comeback as well.&&I cannot remember if it was before or after his character died, but he did not want to talk about himself. He asked me what I do and thanked me for it. He was an incredibly humble man. I floundered and was star struck. It was pretty awesome.&&All shows get worse as they go past 2-3 seasons. 99% of TV would be better wrapped up in nice, planned arcs, but they don't make barrels of money that way. &&Did we watch the same show? Dale was constantly frantic and wide eyed. One if his defining character traits was that he was an alarmist. &&Negan's problem as a comic book villain is that he's a straight up comic book villain in a way that even the Governor wasn't. The Governor was a sadistic piece of shit, but Negan is just over the top in his evil. His TV version is at least a bit more...obviously full of shit. &&And then they introduce ""Princess""..&&Yea I tend to think more of season 3 and 4 when I think of him though. For me, season 3 was the peak of the show. The stuff with the governor and the prison &&Thanks, Ken M.&&It might be that he was actually already dead if it took any time for the announcement of his death to be made. &&r/NotKenM

Plus

r/KenM&&More than likely it has something to do with Rick's departure, which they finished filming around the time of SDCC. So if that's the case then yeah, it was probably filmed awhile ago.&&[deleted]&&Something like that is the only way I could see, like when Tyreese was hallucinating and spoke to a few dead characters.&&Maybe they're going for the *Lost* ending.&&Oh.

Should have thought about that&&You absolutely did the right thing. Dont ever doubt that.&&You did, man for sure. Would you let me tell you a story?

My grandpa had Parkinson's and psuedo-lukemia (myodisplastic syndrome) I took him for 6 hour long monthly transfusions 60 miles away every month for 5 years.  When he heard the news about Robin Williams he said ""maybe he had the right idea.""  I couldn't disagree with him.  Parkinson's was a special kind of hell.  First he couldn't shoot guns with me anymore. Couldn't write.  Couldn't shovel his own sidewalk.   Couldn't drive.  Walk. Stand. On his own.  

So at 19 I dropped out of college and I became his caretaker because my mom wasn't physically strong enough to hold him up to get to the toilet.  5 years I worked a full time job in water/wastewater treatment and took care of Grandpa.  I harbor zero bad feelings about that time in my life.  I'm 26 now, he gave me his home when he passed, as payment for everything, but I'd have done it for free.  It was a nice surprise when I found out though.

In his prime he was 6'2 and 200 lbs.  When I took him to the hospital the last time he was hunched over from the Parkinson's to about 5'3 And weighed 130lbs.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, some people have to live it out because they can't pull the plug so-to-speak.  And believe me, if he had a plug to pull he would have looked at me and said ""I'm tired, let me go"" and even though a part of me went with him, I would have had to do it.

When I comes to end of life care remember it's about what they need.  Sometimes putting an end to their misery is the right choice.  I know that sometimes it feels like you were throwing him away, at least I felt that way about 6 weeks before that last trip to the hospital when he and I had decided no more transfusions, no more needle pokes, uncomfortable car rides, extended stay waiting rooms.  I still feel that way once in a while.  But he had no friends his own age.  No quality of life.  No freedom.  And he was sick, and tired.  And just wanted to sleep.  So he went to sleep.

I was at work when he passed after about 2 weeks in the hospital.  The nurses told me his last words were ""come on Grump.""  Grumpy was the dog he had in high school, when he tended sheep camp in the mountains near our home.  I wish I could have been there by his side, but at the same time the image of him walking into the mountains with his dog, all alone.  Is so beautiful, and how he would have wanted to go out.  I wish for his sake, he could have gone sooner.



Sorry for rambling just got to thinking and I couldn't help myself.  Thanks for letting me share though.&&Luckily the Stephanie Meyer version isn't an adaptation and is completely unrelated.

The Host (2006) is close to an absolutely perfect film.&&Ah gotcha. Thanks. RIP. &&F&&I'm a sucker for modern westerns. Dances With Wolves, Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma, etc. That time period in American history totally captivates me. &&yeeeeouch&&i know you are making a joke but im pretty sure he already filmed his part. He would be either for ricks death or maggies departure (do i need to spoiler tag this if its in their advertising?) and they have already filmed atleast the first event. &&No, he’s just super committed to method acting. &&or he died to get back on the show full time&&#OOF

Take my upvote&&....... and you risk your life.&&I'm pretty sure it decimated anyone's sense of humor who watched anything past the 5th season &&>mods' sense of humor

That's a good one&&Thought this was going another direction, but glad that I was wrong. Sometimes a joke is all you can do to cope, and it helps if you know the deceased would have appreciated it too. I hope people will crack jokes when I'm gone, too. I'm sorry about your loss.&&I thought the season premiere with the school being like a war zone was hilarious. The second episode sucked though. We aren't really far enough into the season to make judgements yet.

It's also no surprise going to a sub for a tv show and then hating on it is going to earn you negative feedback.&&I always thought that was the actual concept of the show? That's actually why I kept watching in the beginning..&&I remember in the second episode, the zombies were using a rock to break into the department store. I thought they were going to utilize the zombies in this show in a cool way.

Nope, just that one time. &&Nah not all shows, some just don’t know how to remain interesting or relevant&&>All shows get worse as they go past 2-3 seasons.

A show called “Better Call Saul” would like a word with you.&&I know your talking about a different genre but how has no one mentioned The Office? Or It's Always Sunny? Plenty of shows are strong for more than 3 seasons &&It took *The Simpsons* about eleven years, and *Breaking Bad* arguably got better as it went on. It really depends on whether the focus is on quality or money. Sometimes there is a trade-off; other times, thankfully, there is not.&&Bruh coronation street tho&&The 90s star trek series were the opposite of that though.&&24 got progressively better until the fifth season, the show peaked there and they could never really top it &&Agents of SHIELD is a really nice exception.&&I strongly disagree - BrBa, PandR, The Office, GOT, Black Mirror, Archer, Bojack, House, BCS, House of Cards (also arguably Sherlock, Stargate, and a number of shonen)

and those are just the ones I've seen.&&Most shows peak at season 3 and have their last solid season at season 5.  &&That's what I like about Spartacus, 3 main seasons and a small one mid way through. Kept the story condensed and exiting. Wrapped up quick but not too quick&&The last season of Fringe. Yuck. &&I could not disagree with you more, muchacho. I could try, but I would fail.&&I must’ve forgot my “/s”&&Yeah they took Rick Grimes and thought lets him make a cult leader and 100x the asshole. Great idea. &&Finally, someone that isn't wooooshed&&That's true.&&SPOILER 

His character was decapitated in the show. 

SPOILER&&God his entire death episode gives me chills, one of the best of the entire show easily.&&As much as I'm disappointed by the show, that episode will always be an absolute stand out &&I appreciate you sharing your story. You did so much good for your grandpa, and I'm sure that made all of the difference in his passing. You gave him peace and comfort in a time of need. &&Great story. Thank you for sharing.&&Hey, I just wanted to let you know that you're a good person who did the right thing when you were called to do it, and that I admire you and see you as someone to look up to.&&That was so touching. It made me all teary eyed. You did a great thing and have a way with words :)&&Aw man fuck myelodisplastic syndrome. My dad had it for almost 3 years before he died in May. I’m sorry your grandpa went through it too.

He had pretty much decided that he was done with the transfusions but the MDS made it a moot point. We lived across country from each other but I was very lucky to be able to be there for his whole last month. I’m glad you got that time with your grandpa too.

&&I've had it on my Plex server for years now but I've never got around to watching it. I think because the quality isn't the greatest on my file&&F&&If you've seen it lately you would understand.&&Oof&&At first I was like, “nah they couldn’t have filmed for 2019 yet” and then I remembered it’s already October. &&God dammit lol I don’t really watch normal tv and I’m only on s3e16 right now (pretty much the climax of the situation with the governor) ..I had gotten about this far a lil while back but quit watching so I started over again recently 

But yeah spoiled indeed lol&&Wait if Rick dies then who the hell is the main character???&&I stopped watching after they fake killed Glenn. I just knew they’d kill him off the same as the comics and was just pissed off with the pointless bait and switch to force some drama.
Also the fact that every episode only focuses on 2-3 characters. It makes the show feel SO SLOW. &&I couldn't get through the 2nd.  Something about halving the budget, doubling the episode count, and axing Frank Darabont after he got the show together and got all these actors together that just wanted to work with him again.  A real fucking shitshow.&&No, there's an original TWD comic which is actually pretty good, and a lot different from the show.

That's what I was expecting, not this shit&&The original concept isn't zombies. It's actually the question of how far would you go if you were in an impossible situation like an apocalypse. The zombies are just thrown in.&&You mean you don't like the repetitive circle that is TWD?

Go to new place > meet new people > new people seem nice > new people are not nice > people die > place gets destroyed > time to look for a new place > go to new place...&&I feel like there's just a certain ""genre"" of television where the show has a fun premise but not actually good writing. So after a few seasons it seems to get bad when actually the premise has simply played out. Weeds, Dexter, TWD all fall into that category in my opinion.&&Read the comics. They don't have that problem&&Better call saul too, better with every season. &&It's such masterfully done slow burn but with so many memorable moments I absolutely love it.&&And Sopranos. Also, It’s Always Sunny didn’t really dip in my opinion until the last season, and even then half of it was still brilliant. 

A lot of shows do run out of steam around season 4 though &&BCS is so clouded by the question of “where will this go?”  that it’s difficult to critique the seasons on their own right. I am immensely entertained by each, especially having watched Breaking Bad, so I’m not upset, but I’m worried that each ark will prove really unsatisfying for viewers and retroactively make the show worse, especially Mike’s storyline. Still, I enjoy watching it immensely, and that’s more than I can say for a lot of shows &&I've recorded the newest season but haven't watched an episode yet. Guess I should get on it&&The Office took a fucking dive last 2 seasons though, and not just because Michael was gone. &&Similarly to what I said to others, I should have specified in the original post: I meant live-action drama's. Sitcoms do really well because their format suits episodic content. Some great sitcoms with great longevity. &&Breaking Bad also ended right when it needed to IMO. It wasn't too early so I wanted more but it also didn't drag on and get repetitive. Stuck the landing and I think that's the hardest part of writing a good show. &&I should've specified live-action dramas in my original post. The Simpsons is maybe the best show of all time (seasons 3-10 imo) but benefits from being an episodic cartoon. 

You're right about the last bit. Influential writers, helmers or stars can push for creative interests over monetary, but it's difficult. &&Classic &&TNG took 3 seasons to find its footing (funnily enough, they also got rid of the showrunner around then IIRC and Gene took a step back too), DS9 took until season 3 to start warming up and hit its stride in season 4. Voyager got slightly better in season 4 with Kes leaving and Seven coming along, and by then the Doctor had the mobile emitter basically turning him into Rimmerfrom Red Dwarf, but Voyager never really achieved the heights of the other two.

The Trek shows suffered less from fatigue within their own shows, and more as a franchise as a whole with two guys running it in both TV and movies, they just kept getting worse after Gene died. Voyager was the first show not to get run past Gene, Enterprise was even worse (I hear it got good in the last season but by then fatigue had set in enough to kill the franchise) and the movies went steadily downhill to the extent that the only good TNG movie was First Contact, with Berman and Braga even finding a way to undo parts of the ending of Ds9&&I agree with you on almost all of these, but I feel House of Cards  kind of lost its direction after S2 when Frank's rise to power reached its peak- at least, I never felt nearly as engaged with the show in S3 and onward.  Also, the last season of Sherlock was an utter shitshow of monumental proportions. The last episode manages to cram in such a colossal quantity of nonsensical plot points, horribly written characters, manufactured drama, obvious plotholes, and tonal whiplash that it's honestly kind of impressive.&&Same as I've said to others, I should've specified this as dramatic live action. Black Mirror is a series if unconnected episodes, not the same. Episodic cartoons and sitcoms as well, they lend well to tv, agreed. 

Bojack and House though? House went into will-they-wont-they territory, had him leave his job, re-hook up with the obvious love interest blahblah. It ran its course long before. Is there really much else to do with Bojack now? He and Diane circle, he's hit rock bottom, he continues working blahblah...what else needs to be said? Great runs from great shows but cut the cord, y'know? &&Someone burned down my wooooshed. &&And his head was still doing this in walker form...

😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😮&&F&&Had to quit when **that one guy** died.

**Edit:** whoops.

**Edit 2:** Yes of course I meant the one and only T-Dog.&&I stopped watching in season 2 when they spent half the season searching for that dumb kid. 

Surprised the show is still going on, all I hear are negative comments towards it. The first season was so good as well.&&And the first one is already available on their new streaming service, and will air in about 16 hours from this comment&&Abandon it now.  There's zero reason to voluntarily get yourself into this train wreck of a show.&&I mean, Rick hasn't died in the show yet, but Andrew Lincoln is leaving and Lauren Cowen isn't coming back after this season. That's what's in the news. So not really spoiled, officially?

Edit to add: should probably get off the internet if you're that far behind&&Yea I stopped watching after terminus.... started to go downhill after governor. &&Watch until after the prison.. the next season or so is ok, but the best is over by this point.&&Yeah you can stop now and still like the show, it's pretty bad now&&Daryl. They should honestly just end things with season nine, or better yet, just cancel season nine entirely.&&Rick was never REALLY the main character in the graphic novels, that torch passed to Carl fairly early on. &&I feel they are trying too hard to set up some unstoppable ensemble cast franchise like Lost used to do. It never seems to pan out well for these long running shows&&Yeah I stopped watching after Negan whacked Glenn and Abraham. After that it was all downhill.&&God this! It’s just bad writing. Dramatic end of season cliff hangers worked in the days of shows like Dallas but in today’s world? With internet and people camping out on sets and leaking studio documents or whatever...no, it’s not interesting or exciting. It’s a crutch for people who can’t keep you interested because of their writing talents so they have to keep you interested with tricks. &&I’ve watched so many tv shows and twd is the only one I’ve dropped, just shows how bad the show has become. &&Yeah, but it was fun to criticize people who actually thought he was dead.&&Yep. I watched season 1 in one sitting. I know, it was short. But I loved it. It took me a year to slog through season 2. People kept telling me 3 is better and to come back to it. Spent another year watching 3. Then people told me to watch 4. Nope. I'm done.&&Yeah. I never made it past the farm.&&Well you missed out because there were some definite gems in seasons 3 and 4. &&That's kind of what I meant. A social study&&You forgot the melodramatic debates about whether they are the good guys or the bad guys, or whether killing is justified, etc. You would think after 5 years or whatever they wouldn't be having the same debates and flip flopping every single time on what they believe...&&I always tell people to read the source material if they're fed up with the show. That loop is escaped and long forgotten around issue 70 (current issue is 184, so more than half the series by now is past that) when Rick and company figure out that walling themselves off with concrete and machinery is plenty enough to hold off the dead. Then it becomes a story of different walled societies who solved that problem fighting over resources--eventually building trade routes between communities as their economy thrives and actual civilization once again takes root.

The current plotline features the largest organized civilization in The Walking Dead comics, as it's in Ohio and has some 50,000 citizens. Rick's people have been communicating with them via Radio from outside D.C. 

The infinite loop the show got caught up in forgot the entire purpose of the story: Watching Rick Grimes conquer the dead and move on to rebuilding society the best he can. 

Shoutout to /r/theroamingdead&&what happens after going to new place? tell me please!&&Yeah I see that but I wasn’t referencing TWD in this specific response&&Scrubs and 30 Rock got over a hump

I agree with your claim 
Some can’t jump the tropes they got attention for as a premise to last long with significant content over many seasons &&TWD started going downhill when the show's creator got booted after S1 (which is why Scott Wilson's character EDIT:(I meant Dale, sorry. They both look old and forgot they were different characters) got killed off in S2). Dexter had good writing until it didn't (imo). I think bad management is what really fucked these shows. &&IMHO, it's the difference between a show based on a ""fun idea"" and one with a story to tell.  The ""fun idea"" ones get boring/bad fast.&&I was super pissed when the Dr. didn't die at Trendalore. &&More episodic television is able to persist beyond the first few seasons, and often gets better in later seasons as the actors get their ""footing"" for their characters and are able to naturally explore their characters more. Most Star Trek series, for example.&&I have, and I’m not talking about TWD in this specific response&&If there is one thing Vince Gilligan is an expert at, it is making totally unexpected story decisions that in hindsight make total sense and fit in really well. I have faith in him; he hasn't let me down yet (other than the whole plane crash thing in breaking bad, which was a little too weird for me).&&I thought Season 9 sort of saved things a bit. Season 8 was rough, but still not bad on an absolute scale. &&True but the comment I'm replying to states all shows fall off after three seasons. Office is gold seasons 2-7&&Yep. That show was perfectly timed.&&The ending of Breaking Bad was the best TV-show ending I have ever seen. >!I just loved how you had the kind of pause with Walter White successfully escaping and living in that cabin (a point where another story might have ended), only to go on towards one of the most satisfying redemption story-arcs I have seen.!<&&I know what you mean. *Lost* definitely declined in quality towards the end. The writers’ strike certainly didn’t help, though.&&The later seasons of House were the lowest rated on RT, but that ""low"" is still 83%. Bojack's most recent season is 100%. You may not have liked them, but your opinion is not some objective measure that points to shows becoming worse after x seasons.

As for dramatic live action, there's BrBa, House of Cards, BCS, and GOT as I mentioned, as well as Mad Men and Doctor Who.&&F&&Yep, rip T dog &&I’m still catching up so thx for not spoiling who dies&&I had to quit when that one guy wouldn't die. Stupid fucking show.&&COARL!!!!!!!&&The dude with the face?&&Dude, spoilers &&I also quit thereabouts. But I also watched the next episode, and just the violent shift in tone (going from a horrific and violent episode to a corky and funny one) really turned me off from the show.  &&I stopped watching after the Glenn fake out.

That was fucking horse shit. I get we're watching a show about corpses coming back to life so you have to suspend realism to begin with BUT WHAT THE FUCK HE WAS COVERED IN THE VISCERA OF A FRESHLY DEAD ALLY SURROUNDED BY A HOARD OF ZOMBIES AND HE FUCKING CRAWLS THROUGH THAT NECROCRITIC BULLSHIT TO A DUMPSTER FOR THE SAKE OF A CHEAP ASS CLIFF HANGER JUST TO GET SKULLFUCKED THE NEXT SEASON

So yeah, I should have stopped watching after the second season as well&&If you binge-watched the season it wasn't bad at all, but if you were actually waiting week to week when season 2 came out it would definitely seem terrible. &&The pay off when they found her was so damn good though! &&Same here. They seemed to spend the whole day hanging out round a fucking barn. Tried to pick it up again but it’s so dull and repetitive.&&I agree, the first season was pretty short, but showed a lot of promise.  That second season was terrible, I gave up after the first half.  I watched a few shows a couple seasons later when I heard it was improving, but then that whole prison battle was so stupid I never watched it again.&&I have stopped watching twd a long time ago but still enjoy the spinoff fear twd. Better stories, gore, humor and places to explore. Finally a post-apocalyptic cityscape in shot instead of twd's boring industrial buildings and endless shuffling around in forests. Fear...certainly has its flaws but for me it took over the torch admirably. &&Hey man, chill out. It's still got some awesome effects and pretty good ""twists"". Also just seeing Negan played my boy Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a treat in it's own. &&Season 4 or 5 is often the cut-off for when a show becomes bad. At that point it becomes repetitive and the characters have completed their journey and writers seemingly run out of good ideas. Characters become caricatures of themselves and the traits that make them 'good' or 'funny' get exaggerated. I've never seen a show go past season 5 that this hasnt happened to. &&Yeah, well - lost was stupid. &&How about when the governor arc took up two seasons instead of one? &&How do you know it went downhill if you stopped watching..?&&Neither did the little girl&&Oh yeah totally! That's what I figured you meant! I wanted to piggy back off of your comment!

I don't watch the show anymore but a major character for the show is Negan because he stands to be the contrast from Rick. And in the comic books, Carl is meant to truly be the main character because he's caught between the two and represents bits of both of them.&&In FTWD thay are pretty much going on a cross country feelsgoodman trip to ~help~ people.&&THIS IS THE WAY THINGS HAVE TO BE NOW&&> Watching Rick Grimes conquer the dead and move on to rebuilding society the best he can. 

and having his son take over leadership. welp the show really fucked that one.&&Sounds very interesting, you convinced me to read the comic.&&A LOT easier for comedies to continue to push forward and create new situations. Drama's have to be dramatic (surprise) in order to work and it's really hard to continually accomplish that without inducing tedium. 

I think Breaking Bad is so highly regarded because it ended. If Lost or Dexter ended after 2-3 seasons people would think of it very differently. &&Scrubs was terrible from about 5 to 7. 8 was o.k and that's where oit should have ended.&&Pretty sure Scott Wilson’s character died in S4. &&Scott Wilson played Hershel not Dale. &&Scott Wilson's character was introduced in season 2 and killed off in season 4.&&Interesting.  I've never heard anyone have an issue with that aspect of BB. Walter was indirectly responsible for the deaths of all those people. The small tease with the teddy bear in the pool & the payoff at the end of the season/the execution of it all was excellent.&&I never understood the hate for the later seasons. All of them are fucking fantastic. It’s probably Jim and Pam’s worst season, and of course Michael is gone, but I always felt that made the rest of the characters really shine. The writing quality is still superb in those seasons.&&Also The Sopranos, The Wire and Justified all stayed good past the third season.&&F&&r/onetruedog&&T-Dog is the One True Dog. RIP. &&Let's get some ""F""s in this thread.

F&&Anybody you’re interested in will get a sneaky twisty episode where they almost die. One or two might. More importantly, your interest will die first &&There were so many chances for that one guy to die. It drug on way to long. Apparently he's still not dead &&*rubs head*

Lemme ask you summink RICK&&I'm anti- that guy with the nose and hair. &&[Cyborg Governor was seen on set for filming of Season 9, as well as Merle's ghost.] (#spoiler)

[Also, they meet a magical dwarf in Episode 8 played by Danny DeVito, who promises to ressurrect T-Dog if Rick sacrifices one of his own.](#spoiler)&&When Maggie killed Hershal is was mainly as a sacrifice to the Dark One (who created the zombies in his bid to take over the earth). This is all explained in season 4...

Also, Rick is Daryl's sister.&&I stopped for a while after the Glenn stuff, then tried to catch up on everything I missed a few months ago and stopped once I got an episode into season 8.  I just cant watch it anymore.  If they aren't trying to turn into a soap opera like drama then they're adding nonsense just for shock value.   I feel like I could do a better job than their writers with a little bit of adderall and a joint. &&I stopped watching after the end of the Glenn season (if that makes sense). During that entire season, they were gearing up and making friends to eventually take on Neegan and then all of a sudden the season was over. It just got way too boring and I lost interest. It’s super disappointing because with the exception of possibly The Governor, Neegan is easily the best villain I’ve seen in not only TWD, but any show in years. 

Maybe when the series ends I’ll binge it on Netflix, but for now I don’t see a point watching a show that for all of tents and tortoises has no end. ^^this ^^is ^^the ^^exact ^^reason ^^i ^^gave ^^up ^^on ^^supernatural ^^too&&I liked the fake out, but I don't think they needed to wait like 3 weeks to give us the resolution. That was so fucking dumb.&&The Talking Dead episode after that was so utterly cringeworthy too. No respect for viewers.&&You kinda have to binge watch it because the episodes are 40 minutes of fuck all with 5 minutes of drama at each end. &&I think after they found her, the season suffered.  Instead of moving on, they did that whole Randall non-sense and Herschel went from ""You All Need to Leave, NOW"" to ""We want you to stay"" in the span of one episode&&Scott Gimple left TWD so he could start ruining FTWD.... and he's succeeding. :(&&Now normally I wouldn’t say much about the effects but I will point to the deer scene and the junkyard awful green screen as an example of semi recent awful effects. But the zombies themselves still look pretty good imo&&Negan was terrible. Kind of takes away from the whole ""apocalyptic"" feel when there is somehow all these giant bands of survivors everywhere. Negan existed only to give conflict to Rick and to finally be the one who ""beats"" him. Sure Jeffrey Dean Morgan did a damn good job playing him but the character himself was hamfisted and extremely dumb. That was finally the point where I could no longer watch. &&how do i delete someone's account&&[deleted]&&I stopped at the govna,  I just couldn't enjoy TWD around that time for some reason.  Its like Dexter, another show that I was addicted and ecstatic about more than anything at the beginning, and then suddenly 180d and got disinterested all at once and left wondering 'd-did it get really bad or did I just get used to it? Am I maybe not paying hard enough attention to enjoy it? Am I being picky and negative and ruining my fun?""  Its like when you like a girl and later stop liking her and miss that feeling and wonder what's going on.

I specifically remember actually it was the episode where T...pain? Tbone? T..dogg? died.   I don't think that in itself made me lose interest, I think I just suddenly lost interest unrelatedly in either the episode after or the episodes after, just too suddenly.

Anyways, as I think about it, after experiencing the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad I guess I realize; no, a good show doesn't let you get bored with it.&&You expect Glenn's eye to roll uphill?&&there really aren't any good zombie TV shows are there?&&I stopped watching at the mid season finale for that stupid reason. As someone who has read the comics that was just a gigantic slap in the face. Finding out it was because they didn't want to pay him adult wages was all the incentive I need to just boycott for good.&&>and having his son take over leadership. welp the show really fucked that one.

Haven't watched TWD since season 4.

Did they kill Carl?? 
&&And this is why I stopped with the show.  Still reading but not caught up currently. &&It's the way they're developed as well. I imagine lost/dexter the writers before every season would sit down and say ""well, we've got another season, what should happen?"" 

Shows like breaking bad or game of thrones are much better because there's an overall story arc. you get the sense things are heading towards some defined end, not just being extended indefinitely through whatever contrived scenario they come up with next. &&Lost was pretty good but then they got to the parallel timelines and I just got confused.&&I think he's thinking of the guy that played Dale. &&Definitely killed off in s4. &&I forget the whole gist of the plane crash... How was Walter indirectly responsible?&&man this is fucking awesome LOVED him on the walking dead man&&For his one okay deed.&&F&&This is the thing, they’re still running around scrounging and battling with people like it’s the first year or so...&&I will have a low monthly payment on my card? &&M'ask you sumn&&Gotta pay the troll toll to get into that boys soul&&That episode was so good, too. That twist was actually unexpected, not like most of the middle seasons. &&We’re talking about how bad the series has gotten, not ways that would make me keep watching because I’d watch the shit out of that&&In regards to your second spoiler: I hope he plays him like he played the troll in the Nightman Cometh.&&If they acknowledged that they kinda jumped the shark and started doing stuff like this, I'd watch the hell out of it.&&These sound like legitimate Z Nation spoilers.&&Dude I believed cyborg governor until I read the second one.&&If Danny DeVito joined TWD, I would 100% start watching again&&Cyborg Governor? What is this,  fuckin Dragonball Z? lol&&But if they had good writing, they wouldn’t have been able to include all the torture porn S. Gimple jerks off to.&&>adderall and a joint. 

That sounds like a horrible mix. It would be like one long panic attack.&&The apocalypse was like 3 years ago at this point man, this is exactly when larger groups should be forming.

I stopped at the mid season finale last year though.&&It was kind of stupid though. The whole show is basically a fraud, they promoted it as a mystery series and you think the writers must be brilliant and have some plan to resolve it all but in the end is pretty much ""it was all just magic so anything is possible, that explains everything, the end"". Ever since they have been lying about it saying that the show was about the character all along but then why did they have fucking giant billboards saying ""answers are coming""?&&I was convinced it awesome until the last season. But the last season was such a toxic heap of shit that actually as an average across all of the seasons the whole show was dragged down from ""awesome"" to ""awful"".&&I was waiting for the climax where the massacre happens and they kill basically every main character but it just left you wanting more. I stopped as soon as that season ended and I stopped at issue 100 from the comics. 

I was actually still interested at that point because I liked T-Dog. The way they do their finales is weird. They’ll basically end the season right when some crazy shit happens and then you have to wait for next season like they have nothing to entice you into the next season. 

I stopped but I always caught the last 5 minutes of the Negan season and I was happy I quit watching when I did. &&It's hard to do I guess. Eventually the zombies stop being interesting and the human enemies have to keep getting more ridiculous to differentiate them from the last baddies.&&Drew Barrymore’s is pretty funny:  Santa Clarita Diet.&&It was a big reason I stopped watching as well. Although I should've quit much sooner because I had been hate-watching the show since at least S5. And now that even Rick himself will likely die next season since Andrew Lincoln is gonna leave the show, it'll go even further downhill.&&I stopped when they made Glen look like Gumbi.&&Yes.&&*Coral &&Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think BB had *all that much* in the way of preplanning.  I think that WW’s arc is sort of baked into the premise of the show - rise and fall of drug lord, with or without some minor redemption at the end - and so once they decided to end it at the point they did, they “kicked in” the end game, more or less, but there weren’t concrete plans with how they’d get to the end point.&&lmao yep, am dummy&&[By letting Jane die, since her father was the Air Traffic Controller (or something along those lines) responsible for the crash.](#spoiler)&&",2018-10-06 22:21:46

The first time people here called netflix trash etc, now theyre praising it.

Really they can estimate whatever and it completely changes how people react.

Netflix is still king, but it is becoming more flawed. Like how if you click on the recently added tab it doesnt actually tell you what's recently added....

Netflix is gonna grow for ages though, especially in worldwide numbers.&&I was hooked on ""Atypical"" Netflix make some great original shows&&Watch Norsemen


Fucking hilarious&&You know guys...maybe this “Netflix” thing might be a good idea! &&Netflix takes gambles on new material, new directors, new artists, and new actors and it's paying off.  The ""Studios"" never risk or try something new and could learn a thing or two from streaming platforms.  I hope this continues and more new, great content is generated like Altered Carbon!&&[deleted]&&Just rewatched Altered Carbon.  That is some of the finest sci-fi I've ever seen filmed.  More power to Netflix and yay for a second season of AC.  &&Well YouTube is down so that makes sense&&The non Hollywood horror movies on Netflix are so refreshing and most welcomed&&Their show are great lately! Elite was excellent and addictive&&As someone who's not really into their originals (other than a couple of comedies) I wish 3rd party content was still easy for them to get. I didn't join them years ago because they were becoming another cable channel basically, who would one day make their own content. I joined because it was a one stop shop to stream a huge variety of things in one service.&&Wow YouTube goes down for how long and Netflix adds 7 mil New subscribers as a result?&&I wish Netflix had the same content everywhere. I try to support their business in my country but their archives is making me sad. I know it is a matter of copyright but as a customer I need my money's worth. If you can hear me Netflix: please increase the amount of your content in Turkey. There are lots of people thinking like me. At least you should be able to add your own exclusive shows...&&Netflix has been been amazing this year, can't deny that 

I am still hella salty they canceled Marco Polo tho :(&&[deleted]&&Bojack, Big Moth, Stranger Things....and all the other shows I need to watch. 

Also, I'm just happy because I bought some Netflix stock after the dip and before this...Woot!

Edit: Typo. It should be Big Mouth. Go watch it for the Hormone Monster and Hormone Monstress!&&Still waiting for Qwikster to send me the next DVDs in my queue: Green Lantern, Fast Five, and Battle:Los Angeles.



&&I am happy that Netflix is doing well, and while I hate some of the stuff they have produced in the past, I have really enjoyed the recent months. I'm twitching for more Mindhunter, Final Space, Narcos, Crown, etc. etc. The list goes on.&&The comedy specials have been nice lately. Joey Diaz on October 30th don't sleep on him &&I got Netflix this month but the Bulgarian version is pretty much shit, it's basically the Turkish on e with less than 10% having Bulgarian subtitles. I don't know what shows does the US version have, but here The Office (US), Parks And Rec and IASIP are not in the catalog. I got it so my mother can watch some cool tv shows with subtitles, but 90% of them don't have Bulgarian subs, only English and Turkish, like wtf&&The international market is a big part of that. Domestically Netflix only added a million according to the article, meaning the bulk of the new subs came from the rest of the world. Bear in mind the international market doesn't get as big a selection as the US does, so it seems their originals have to carry the lineup in the international market. &&I honestly don’t get the wide spread hate for Netflix? For $10 a month, I more than get my money’s worth. I just watch The Shining on it tonight. Sure, some of their original content is bad, but there is enough stuff that’s good to great in my opinion. &&New content: Great

New UX/UI: Not Great

Auto-playing: Free Cable level of awful&&What are these people watching? I cant find anything&&>No other studio wouldve ever made Maniac

IMO that's always been the potential of Netflix.  They own all of their distribution, no theater means no MPAA policing their content and theatres means no overhead so they are more able to take risks.  Since people buy the package and not individual pieces of content they are also freer to make more niche programs.&&So glad you mentioned Maniac. First show that came to mind when you said new material. Talk about a unique show.. Netflix is currently the independent studio for movies, shows, and comedy and no one's even close. Disney is about to own the blockbuster but that's the only comparison. &&Maniac and The Haunting of Hill House have kept me very entertained this month.  Really amazing and unique shows.&&Maniac was sooo good.  I love how original some of the stuff on Netflix is.  it doesn't all work, but sometimes you get something fun and fucking insane like ""The OA""&&I just binged Big Mouth and American Vandal season two, and I'd say Big Mouth got even better. Vandal was pretty good too if you liked the first season. &&Few other studios would make big mouth and have it be so free! &&Their originals are outstanding. I honestly think Bojack is one if not the best series on television at the moment, not something you'd expect from a ""netflix original"". &&They added a lot of movies back that were on there back in like 2013 but were removed for a while. Like Happy Gilmore and I think Truman Show?&&Is this actually worth watching?  It keeps popping up in my recommendations but I thought it was Netflix forcing it.&&Another reason is that I just don't think people unsub from it, I know I don't, I can go weeks without using Netflix, but not once have I checked my bank account and seen a Netflix payment and thought ""Hmm, maybe I should cancel that"".&&Loving Ozark right now.&&Maniac was fucking incredible! I wanna watch it again. &&Yes! I remember the story a few years ago when they decided to invest an obscene amount of money into original content. I remember thinking they must have received a really confident market analysis to make that kind of move and look at them go. I think it’s awesome that there’s a growing non Hollywood movie source, I hope we can afford it next year :)&&They’ve brought In shows from across the planet 

Watch the “Norseman “ it’s a hilarious Viking show with killing and rape but hilarious at the same time. 

Surprising!!;  I know. 


That’s why it’s so good. &&Maniac took a lot of cues from Legion, to be fair. Not necessarily plot wise but I don’t think it’s fair to say other networks aren’t taking chances on edgier stuff. &&I just started watching DS9 finally so I will get to that one eventually.&&You just reminded me I need to go finish Season two of Ozark&&[deleted]&&Speaking of recent Netflix animation, The Dragon Prince was terrific. Same creator as Avatar: The Last Airbender. &&Full grown man
 
Saturday morning with coffee and Hilda

Pure joy&&Put it on for my kids and walked away but listened to the theme song and WTF this sounds like Grimes so boom watched the whole season over a week with them.
Took me a few episodes to realise Hilda is Lady Mormont from GOT.
Cool show.&&If you like Hilda you should check out Over the Garden Wall&&Hilda is out?, I didn't know that, I remember watching trailer and thinking, This looks like gravity falls, I am definitely gonna watch. I guess I know what I am doing today.  &&I started drawing again thanks to hilda, the art is deceptively simple yet oh so good.

Bought the comics because of the cartoon as well.&&Hilda is fantastic. It's adorable, and strange, and we'll written. 10/10. &&Definitely. I've been a big fan of the books, which are represented in the first few episodes and the last (although I'd argue the show was strongest when it wasn't based on the books). &&My daughter loves that show. It’s so mellow and yet weirdly fantastical &&Same for Big Mouth season 2. Holy crap Netflix is getting good at content.&&Hilda is SO GOOD&&Yes it's so good! &&Voltron is the shit too !&&I feel a lot of their approach to films is simply adding content. That being said they have Cuaron, the Coen Brothers and Scorsese films lined up with Cuaron's Roma getting incredible reviews. &&[deleted]&&Might be just me but some of their most recent movies I loved (apostle, hold the dark) and really looking forward to the Night Comes for Us.&&It seems to me, and I hope someone else has noticed this:

The bad movies seem like TV pilot pitches stretched out, and the bad TV shows seem like a movie stretched out over a season. &&Because prestige directors do what Edger Wright did today and complain about their movies not being seen on the big screen. 

Netflix is going to take over the low budget comedy and rom-com space, then build from there.  They also have more young female directed movies in the past year than Hollywood has had in years.  As those women get better and better, so will Netflix's movies.
&&*Roma* and *The Ballad of Buster Scruggs* and *The Other Side of The Wind* won't disappoint.&&Their movies are from the classic era of shit movies. Movies which have enough engaging scenes that you don't turn off the TV - but dumb enough that you can watch them disengaged. 

You don't need 2 undisturbed hours for Adam Sandler movies. You put it on, you do your laundry,n you chop your veggies and you come back to see you didn't miss much. 

That's exactly what Netflix is going for.&&if you throw a dozen pieces of shit on the wall one will stick. Netflix throws hundreds&&What are you talking about. The Christmas Prince is getting a sequel. They are doing something right.&&My heating system is not working properly ATM... so I guess Netflix and chill?&&That was my thought, back to school with tons of new devices and new passwords.&&Wait what?? They cancelled iron fist??! &&What sucks was that Iron Fist season 2 was actually pretty good. Way better than god awful season 1. Actually made me look forward to season 3. &&I still can't believe people watch 20 different shows on comic book heros, after a while it should get  pretty predictable.&&I liked Iron Fist, even the first season.  True, it was really carried by the supporting cast rather than Finn Jones, I hope they find a way to work Colleen and the Meachums into the other series, even some Danny Rand cameos would be good. 

They could rework the whole thing to be Colleen-centric and release it as a new series, that would work well. &&I'm really digging Haunting of Hill House. The funeral episode was masterfully done. &&HoHH is amazing. I binged 4/5 episodes and got so into the show that I had to stop because I thought I was hearing things in the house. LoL. I love a good scare movie which are very hard to get. &&They bought the rights for Narnia! I'm so excited!!!&&Wtf 9.1 on IMBD. It's rare that horror movies and shows score that high. Gonna have to sign up &&I’m so pumped for Daredevil season 3 and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which are both out in the next two weeks. Netflix is absolutely killing this October.&&I just finished the ‘Bent Neck-Lady’ ep. That was like...Black Mirror level mind fuck.&&If they fuck up The Witcher series I will never forgive them. 

But I'm hopeful. Definitely hyped to see Cavil as the lead, even if he isn't at all what I picture when I see Geralt.&&Glad to hear, I was thinking about watching that this weekend now I definitely will!&&How scary is it?&&Yes &&Fuck me I want that shit so hard&&Tide yourself over with some of the writer's (Warren Ellis) graphic novels. &&Mr Tepes did nothing wrong!&&What are YOUUUU DOING HERE &&[deleted]&&Now boys and girls do the Bojack! Bojack!&&So you resubscribe for a month once a year when they release a new season? &&My biggest gripe with Netflix is the user interface. I hate that it automatically plays a trailer if you stop scrolling for an instant. I hate that it skips the credits after 5 seconds without my input.

I understand that they want to constantly draw you in, and that the more of their content you watch the more likely you are to remain subscribed, but it's annoying nonetheless.&&the gold they have is their data.  Who knows how they are using that to create content.&&I'm sure at least two people canceled or didn't get a subscription due to the tab bug, lol. &&Yep, thought it didn't sound very good but gave it a shot because I needed a binge fix and damn, I was sad there were only two seasons by the end. &&It will never work &&Haven't noticed these promos in between auto play episodes
&&The best part is that the ""advertisements"" were literally just promos that popped up in the 15 seconds that already existed between autoplayed episodes

I mean, talk about creating a mountain out of a molehill&&I wish they would just give me a setting to stop the automatic trailers on my tv. I have to dance around the listings to avoid them starting.&&Is it worth watching? I watched the first episode and I thought it was awful boring. Does it get better? &&I love how it's the only show currently airing that can swap actors for the MC and it's just a thing.&&Yea, its exactly what you would expect for futuristic but not over the top.&&Yeah, can't wait to see Anthony Mackie as Kovacs. Hope Will Yun Lee is back in flashbacks too.&&That’s cause they effed up deleting google plus &&Train to Busan!!!

Can't wait for #2!!&&Suggestions?&&Elite was soooo good. Like Skins and Gossip Girl had a baby. Perfect for binge-watching.&&If you want tv shows, get Hulu. The selection is great. &&get the DVD mail service they keep the movie selection up to date&&Right...i think similarly&&Why did you remind me of this.&&Big Mouth is hilarious, season 2 titties caught me by surprise. &&> Bojack, Big Moth, Stranger Things...

gotta love that [big moth!](https://imgur.com/gallery/QruBiQM) &&It always boggles my mind when people say there is nothing to watch on there.  For me it is like an embarrassment of riches.  Maybe it's because I remember video stores (where I would spend at least twice the sub fee a month) which were so much more limited.  But I think a lot of people only want recent blockbusters and that is Netflix's weakest department.&&The auto play is the worst thing ever. I would live an option to disable it, it St the very least turn off sound for the auto play&&> New UX/UI: Not Great

i pray that one day my grandchildren will be able to have *TWO* playlists on their netflix account &&if you're looking for ideas, my recent watches have been:

The Punisher

Hold the Dark

Ozark

Big Mouth

Norsemen

22 July

The Good Place

Not everything there is new but honestly there's no way anyone should run out of stuff to watch on Netflix unless they literally do nothing else or just don't like very much stuff.&&\> no theater means no MPAA policing their content  

Has Netflix pushed the boundaries in terms of content? I feel like most of what I've seen has fallen pretty closely into PG-13 or R. Maybe Beasts of No Nation as the notable exception. Watching Hold the Dark now and that one might too.&&they are pulling bigger and bigger names in cinema each year. Isn 't Scorsese's Irishman a Netflix film or something?  &&The beginning of episode 9(I think) of Maniac was ridiculous and awesome. &&If you like horror, I think the Haunting on Hill House is pretty damn good for a series.&&I read an interview of a director whose done a few netflix shows. He said its great, he doesn't have the same restrictions and concerns as he would working for a regular studio.

They produce the content, edit it, and put it up on netflix. &&Still waiting for netflix to release Maniac merch.. a Suckulus for christmas maybe..&&Does it get better after the first episode? Because I found it fine but not particularly gripping and I don’t really start new shows often because of time available to watch tv and such.&&best show of the year imo. i wish there was more production of interesting experimental stuff like it.&&Maniac and apostle has to be my favs of the year.&&God Haunting of Hill House is amazing. If anyone is unsure about it, just watch it. The third episode, (the one focused on Theodora) is the best episode of television I’ve watched this year.&&I am still reeling from The Haunting of Hill House. It has stuck in my mind for so many days - It's probably the most moving piece of television with the most satisfying planting and pay-off, for both plot and character arcs, that I have ever seen.&&Seriously, I love not knowing anything about a show or even knowing of its existence, then discovering that it's amazing! Ate this show up like an extra value meal in a blender!&&You should try Dark. It completely blew me out of the water. SO good.&&I haven’t seen the show yet (looking forward to it!), but I really hope it’s success gets people to watch the 1962 movie, which is an exceptional slow-burn horror film.&&I loved Hill House up until the ending bit where I feel like it just deflated. &&I hated the entitlement of people when The OA came out. A lot of loud people were *furious* about that.

""Netflix fucking sucks, look at this, this is what your money goes towards, I'm unsubscribing.""

And I was like, jesus christ, come on. So you don't like it. Who gives a shit?&&The OA is one of my favourites. There's something about the tone in that show that I just love. &&I did American Vandal Season One last Saturday and Season Two last Sunday. Show totally surprised me and I ended up loving it. &&Bojack Horseman really brought it for season 5 a few weeks ago too.&&Oh fuck I forgot Big Mouth is back.&&Big Mouth is amazing. I watch and work in animation and Big Mouth just blows my mind in what it's achieving story wise.  

Final Space was fantastic as well. It's an adult targeted animation without all the gross out humour you expect. Wonderful story that had me in tears in the end.&&Christ wasn't season 2 just an absolute blast, that show is funny AF&&Their outstanding originals are outstanding, there's plenty, plenty garbage fire originals on NF.&&Is HBO considered a network? Because if so they have way ""edgier"" stuff than Netflix. Honestly Reddit is in love with Maniac right now but I don't really think it was all that edgy( or good but that just my opinion but) that wouldn't have been the example I used for edgy or different Netflix content.&&My kids love it.  I won’t lie, I’ve caught myself watching it a few times when it’s on and they go to bed. &&I loooove Hilda! Me and my wife has been watching it non-stop this week. Can't wait for another season :P&&It's so wholesome. Makes me want to be a better person. It's the perfect show to follow Bojack.&&I love how it glorifies paperwork.&&How can you not like Gravity Falls with British accents?&&It just had a really weird stopping point, and the framerate needs to be pumped up a bit.

It really is pretty good, but I could see the frame rate making people wary since it's especially bad in the first 3 episodes until you get used to it.&&Well not the creators of Avatar, but Aaron Ehasz was the head writer and director of ATLA.&&It has a good starting point and is looking very promising but I wouldn't say it's terrific just yet. I am looking forward to the next season though. They've definitely laid the groundwork for it to turn into something really special.&&WHAT no wonder she’s so cool!&&it's really good, kind of a more whimsical and fantastic world, a bit more innocent, but still funny in some parts, wholesome and genuine&&A lot of it is just letting proven creators simply create what they want. No ads, no advisory ratings, no time constraints, no useless middlemen 'noting' shit for no reason. It's a creator's wet dream, of course it would attract the best and brightest who care about artistic freedom.&&Sooo hype for Roma. It looks likely to snatch a best picture nom at the oscars *as a Netflix film*. Cuarón is a legend. &&Also the more netflix has established its share of the market, the cost of having content to show has gone up. At a certain point its cheaper just to make your own. As soon as the make more syndication deals they make way more money. They can't show ads on netflix, people would riot, but they can on television. It is very good advertising for netflix to have their content seen by as many people as possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman#Syndication&&Netflix has no pacing because it needs no time blocks to be watched. That’s why Fuller House episodes can last 35 minutes. &&I'm surprised to see you down voted.  Not having a theatrical release is a huge deal.  That means you don't get the same award considerations(as admitted by the Academy) and for a lot of directors who don't have an award yet that is a big deal.  &&Netflix and freeze. &&It's true.  All of it.&&No more after season 2, yeah.&&So annoying, they hire a showrunner with an awful track record, ditch him for Season 2 which was better on every single level and then cancel it after knowing they had written in a teaser for Season 3. Luke Cage S3 better have a Heroes for Hire storyline.&&After what Scott Buck did I thought I would never care about Iron Fist again but between season 2 and his amazing episode in Luke Cage S2 I'm actually really devastated about losing this show.&&I was really looking forward to ward and Danny hijinks....:(&&I'm going to have to disagree that season 2 was pretty good. It improved in many areas, but Finn Jones was horribly miscast as Danny and the script dialog was atrocious with many (unintentional) cringe inducing laugh out loud moments. 

Even the excellent performances of Tom Pelphrey (Ward), Simone Missick (Misty) and Alice Eve (Mary) could not save that train wreck.

I don't understand how a entire group of directors could equally perform so terribly. The only thing I can think of is that some lead creative was terrible and the director had no real power or time on set to get things right.

I don't blame actors for ""bad"" acting, it's almost always the directors fault for failing to capture a good performance. But I do note that the more experienced actors in the show turned in good performances. I think this is just because they deliver less bad takes. 

Edit: thinking back to season one, the very excellent David Wenham (Harold Meachum) had no bad lines. This is a bit of clue to the production woes. He is very well respected and most likely just changed his own dialog, and got away with it because of his reputation, and no director could reasonably enforce badly written dialog on him. But I am speculating wildly.&&Did you see that after credits scene? Talk about jumping the shark&&I agree, I very much enjoyed season 2, after torturing myself through season 1 for Marvel's sake.

&#x200B;&&They cancelled it? WTF? Season 2 was amazing!&&It was easily my favourite second season of all the non-Daredevil Marvel shows, which really surprised me since it's first season was the only show I didn't watch all the way through.&&I think Daredevil has been great at best and mediocre at worst. Vincent D’Onofrio is amazing as Fisk at least. New season looks pretty good from the trailer. Punisher was pretty damn good in my opinion too. 

Now the CW shows...yikes. Used to DVR them but stopped a few seasons in. Just so much else to watch or play that’s so much better. &&Even worse, it gets less predictable and really really stupid and illogical. I’ve been watching the CW comic book shows since arrow S1 began. AMA

Only good show left on there is Legends which is *amazing*. &&No offense, but have you watched Jessica Jones or Luke Cage?&&The netflix marvel shows are actually stylistically different and follow the marvel movie formula where each story is in its own genre/subgenre and happen to feature superheroes as opposed to being a ""superhero show/movie"".

So with that in mind you could watch a few different shows and not feel like you are watching the exact same thing.

DC shows I avoid so I'm not sure.&&My favorite part of Ward Meachum in season 2 is that I'm convinced the showrunners must have told the actor to pretend that he's the main character and the whole show is about him.&&some amazing long shots on that episode &&The Two Storms episode's ending is going to haunt me for a long, long time.&&Great show, just watched it this weekend.  I didn't know what to expect at first, but I was sucked in from the get go.  One of the aspects I really enjoyed was the actors they chose.  I think they did a wonderful job with the casting.  

On a side note, I was also surprised by how good It Follows was.    From the movie poster icon I thought it was going to be very cheesy and avoided it for a while, but man what a great premise and overall great story and character development.  If you enjoy horrors/thrillers I highly recommend this movie.   It did a great job of creeping me out for a bit after I was done watching it.   &&I love the fact that there are just random ghosts hanging around that you can see from scene to scene. That’s what sells the show as super creepy. Also I love that it doesn’t resort to jump scares to get you feeling scared. Sure there’s a few but it’s the overall atmosphere of the house and the unknown that really messes with you.&&Bent Neck Lady and floating bowler hat man... Yeesh....&&I've been watching one to two episodes a night for the past few days. This show is so damn good, it really surprised me. I went in thinking it was going to be like American Horror Story.

The non-linear story and ""easter eggs"" in individuals scenes really keep me interested. Plus some of the [spoiler text here](#ghost concepts) are super original and manage to creep me out. And I'm a guy that's fairly jaded on horror these days.&&I’m really curious how they are going to play it.  Will each book be a season? I really liked the movies but I’ve only read The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe. &&I think it shot up to the top rated tv list too. A friend recommended it to me a few days ago and i just couldnt believe a 1 season brand new show is number 30 on imdb?? And then i watched it and thought, no shit. This is a masterpiece hahaha.&&Don't forget Castlevania season 2&&Season 2 punisher soon too. I'm pretty excited.&&I’m curious as to what they’re going to do with the final season of House of Cards.  It started really falling apart in the last couple of seasons, but I’ll stick around to see how they wrap it up.  

Daredevil S3 interests me, I was a bit lukewarm on Punisher, but I’m open to seeing what they do next season.  &&That sums up that ending perfectly. I recently went back and watched that episode again. Man, that was something else.&&I follow the writers on Twitter, they're so engrossed in the lore it's nuts. I am tempering my expectations, but I'm getting very good vibes. &&Cavill's a huge video-game nerd too. He recounted a story about how he was playing Warcraft when he got the call for Superman, and didn't answer.&&Do it man, it's so good! It's like if The Conjuring were 100x better and they smashed it together with Six Feet Under and sprinkled it with a dash of Hereditary.&&I've watched the first half. There are some jump scares but they're not too extreme. There is a little bit of gore and some psychological dread. It's similarly scary to season 1 of AHS or the Conjuring.&&26th! &&And his books are brilliant too. Crooked Little Vein is my favourite novel, although if Netflix want to buy Transmetropolitan I would be very excited.&&And he would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for those pesky speed runners &&What is this, a cross-over episode?&&That's **MR.** Bobo the Angsty Zebra to you. Dammit, now *where* is Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning In The Shape Of A Woman?&&Mr. Chocolate Hazelnut Spread&&As a teenager I’m open to new experiences! &&... and that's how you do the Scarn!&&No we just watch the whole series over and over in between&&I just hate the fact that the “continue watching” category is consistently four fucking rows down the main page. “Continue watching” should *always* be the first thing on the list. I could deal with my list always being number one if “continue watching” was number two. But there’s no reason for “trending” and “new” to come before the “let me get back to what I was doing last time I was here” button. &&I think the credit thing was because they found people were skipping them anyway. If you watch to the end of the credits you will see some post credit credits that include all the different languages.

It does spoil the movie sometimes. I was watching Babe the other day and it has a cool happy song at the end (the same Haggit sings to Babe when he is sick) so you can get your emotions in check and make sure you aren't tearing up (That will do pig, that will do) but it broke into a big colorful promo for a different cartoon with a trailer starting in 5. for their own content they gauge some of the emotional impact and delay when the promo comes up. Wish they'd do that for other films. If I just finish watching Gone Girl, I don't need to jump straight into the trailer for Hold The Dark.&&Weird story, but I was talking with a writer not so long ago, and he told me about the time he went into Netflix for a general. And they actually pulled up his account information and told him what he liked to watch during their meeting. Needless to say it kind of creeped him out.&&Second season just came like a few weeks ago&&Time to buy more Blockbuster stocks. &&Most likely it depends if it's Netflix original or not.

They've stopped completely for me, but when they were showing I noticed that I'd get the promos when binging FRIENDS but not Bojack Horseman.&&We live in a world where if an inch is given, the very next step is 1,000 miles.&&People freaking out about it when HBO as been putting ads in between episodes on their streaming services since they started.&&I liked it. The setting really carries it, and it reminded me a lot of ghost in the shell in its themes. &&It does and then the final two-three episodes will make you regret getting into the show at all they are that bad. The show becomes the morally black and white dichotomy and the story takes a turn to complete shit.&&That's the thing that cracks me up about it. You're never going to have a situation like the show Friends where everybody is getting a ton of money. an 80 year old man playing the main character could be fired and replaced by a 16 year old girl and it would only Take 5 Seconds to explain it away. 

""I decided to try a women's sleeve, and this one was cheap""


I mean he'll you could have the main character be replaced and every single episode or multiple times in an episode with different actors and explain it away.


""Why do you keep changing sleeves every damn day?"" 

""I don't know, it is fun""
&&Not over the top? You sure you watched altered carbon? &&caliber

geralds game

the ritual&&I die a little on the inside whenever I see that show on My List 😭&&Dammit, my fat fingers made a typo again. :(&&22 July has one one the most intense scenes I've experienced since that long-take in Children of Men. 

After that it kind of falls off. I got bored with the rest and didn't end up finishing it. &&[deleted]&&Altered Carbon could’ve put HBO to shame in terms of nudity and violence.  &&> Has Netflix pushed the boundaries in terms of content?

""Boundaries of content"" isn't the same as style of content and the content itself. The ""potential"" is that they've been able to experiment and give shows chances that never would have been made otherwise. Like Stranger Things, they went to all /most of the studios and were turned down. Netflix said yes now it's one of the go to ""Netflix has that!"" shows.

HBO has arguably done the most ""boundary"" pushing but that era is probably over since they have new owners.

Apple is pushing new boundaries the opposite direction by seeing how much they can remove and still call it a show.&&Devilman crybaby was pretty out there, over the top.&&>Has Netflix pushed the boundaries in terms of content?

Big Mouth gets criticised (unfairly imho) as child porn. &&Yes, they have.

Not particularly often, and not really with ultraviolence, but with fairly explicit sex. You don’t notice it particularly because it isn’t meant to be titillating in-and-of-itself (as much of HBO’s early stuff, and even early Game of Thrones was).

That is to say, Netflix shows don’t sell themselves on sex and nudity, but if a creative team wants to have some hard R stuff in there, they are able to. The show jumping to mind is Jessica Jones, which is *far* more explicit than its MCU brethren.&&Big mouth. No one else would have made big mouth. &&Try the big mouth. I think that even goes past R. But because it’s animated I guess it can’t hit NC-17. But that show is hilariously messed up&&I think you haven't been looking enought i guess

2 examples i have: 

Big Mouth its an comedy animated series that is EXTREMELY R-rated in terms of nudity (the protagonists are 13 years old and yet we see them naked constantly; hell the show even jokes itself about being technically child pornograpgy if it wasn't animated). I know we have shows like South Park on TV but i think Big Mouth really pushed boundaries in terms of showing a realistic take on 13 years old going into puberty for the most part.

DevilMan Crybaby its an anine made by Netflix; idk how familiar you are with anime but let me tell you Japan likes to censor they content as well, even more than US at times i would say. DC oushed the boundaries in general by not only being gory as hell (there are more than a few gory animes too but not many so is still controversial there) but also showing sex scenes without censoring or skipping nothing (i have NEVER seen a realistic sex scene in an anime before the way DC did it; Japan its extremely conservative about that topic as well).

Neither of those shows would have been made on other place that wasn't Netflix; and those are just the examples i know of, im sure there must be more.&&Wait for The Witcher&&Not in terms of tits and violence, but in terms of making weird shit that no other producers would make.  Netflix wants something for everyone, so they are not afraid to make a weird crazy niche film or series that only 1% of their user base will want to see.&&It will be, yes.&&And they produced Cuarón’s movie this year, in cinephile circles that’s a pretty much approximately equal get.&&And The Coen Brothers are releasing their new film through them, so there’s that &&Is that the one with the blue alien thing? I rewatch that courtroom/dance scene every day.&&Jonah Hill as a bird made me laugh every time he spoke. It was great.&&I'm halfway through and slowing down to savour it and spot the ghosts in the background.    


It is a bizarre mix of soap drama and horror but it the quality is so high it works.  Beautifully.  &&It was SO good.&&How much is it like the book? I've always wanted to read it but my attention span is dead. &&Ik you’re joking but I honestly want the little dog poop cleaning robot. It’s the cutest thing ever! &&It's kind of slow the whole way through until the very end, but I thought each episode got better and better. &&Episode 6 takes the cake for me. it's basically done in like 5 long takes, the technicality is insane. it's a masterpiece of TV imo&&Theodora is such a fascinating and complex character, I loved every second of her story. She's also so gorgeous!&&Kate Siegel (Theodora) is actually writer/director/showrunner Mike Flanagan's wife! She's also in hush another good Flanagan movie.&&the bent neck lady revelation messed me up&&And remember to always keep a look out for some hidden friends in the background!&&I just finished it.  I feel like I have so much on my mind.  And not even questions about the horror/mystery, though there easily could be.

I just feel like I'm sitting with all the emotional weight of that closing.  It was immensely satisfying, but in that way that a huge meal is.  Afterwards, you just feel kind of bowled over and trying to digest it all.&&Watch Utopia. Go in blind&&Seconded, go watch Utopia. Dont read anything about it.&&Yep, seen it, was great.  Might have been a bit too hard for me to follow without the family tree chart of the characters at their various ages I found though haha.&&Haha I thought it was dumb as hell and stopped after two episodes but never once thought about taking it out on Netflix. These people who expect to love every show they make are insane. Just stop watching and watch something you like. Simple fix. &&[deleted]&&The OA was a demonstration of how Netflix's policy *works*.  It was a hot mess, but like...what other network would have made that?

Netflix keeps putting out different and daring projects, and thing about trying weird and daring things is that sometimes you're going to miss.  And the whole point is that that's okay.  They're not trying to go for the safety that most production companies need to go for, that drives them to the middle of the road. 

If you swing big, it means that when it fails, it fails hard.  But when it succeeds, it's amazing.&&That was Season 5, my dude. &&The Shame Wizard is my favourite TV character at the moment.&&letting writers be as crude as they want is amazing. &&[deleted]&&That’s how I feel about the Dragon Prince&&I tried to get my kids interested so I had an excuse to watch it. The trailer looked charming and the animation great&&they confirmed season 2 is coming at NY Comic-Con&&Yeah the animation is off sometimes, and I'm not sure it's just framerate but I'm no expert. The style looks great in many action sequences etc. but often has a weird peudo 3D design that's not only choppy, but just somehow looks like animation from a PS1 game. I dunno what it is exactly but it really throws me off. &&Yes! The frame rate!!! When my GF and I started watching it I brought up the frame rate. It was giving me a headache after a while. The show itself was good but that bugged me a lot. &&Netflix has a weird (and kind of brilliant) way of releasing story-driven animated shows. Namely Voltron: Legendary Defender, where they release about half a season at a time to keep subs up year round. Expect part 2 in mid to late Feb range, assuming they keep the schedule similar.&&I keep almost watching it, then getting really annoyed just thinking about that framerate. No good reason I can think of to not use 2D animation if your 3D is gonna turn out like that.&&Some of the themes present are very positive for children. A deaf heroine, a 3 legged dog, a stepfamily and so on. They are positive for anyone really. I look forward to more, but they need way more content, 9 episodes was not enough to establish it the best they could have. I felt like it was over too fast with not a big enough climax.&&This is why stand up comedy has flourished so much on Netflix recently. Several comedians have commented on how nice it is to work with Netflix on all these specials because of the freedom they have. &&Unfortunately, this can backfire because sometimes creators work better when they have limits.&&Then again they've filled out a large portion of their original film library with complete garbage so that's a double edged sword. They don't seem to do a lot of QC and are willing to accept crap since there isn't really any risk in releasing something bad, it just gets added to the library and forgotten. Studios have more skin in the game with the spending on marketing and the fact that the films need to make money individually, makes sense that they'd try to meddle more for better or for worse.&&Can’t wait to watch Roma!!!&&It looks really good and I think if it is as good as it looks then people will start taking netflix more seriously as far as films go. It seems like every time they come out with a movie it's either good but flies under the radar or it's hot dogshit and everybody rags on it. &&Wow that’s cool. &&Doesn't that allow for better pacing? Sitcom directors being able to run 28 minutes over the usual 22 minutes gives them an opportunity to tell a more complete story instead of chopping and merging in order to fulfill network commitments.

A 35 minute episode of Fuller House sounds like torture though.&&> Not having a theatrical release is a huge deal. 

I would love to see Netflix buy up some of the small theaters for that reason.  It really goes against what they are trying to build, but I think it would help them with directors.  &&Netflix and frostbite. &&Wasn’t Netflix interested in bringing it back for another season? I thought I read something about Disney or marvel or some shit playing a part in it being cancelled and possibly wanting to put it on their new streaming service or some sort of shit like that. Swear it was in the article that announced the show was cancelled &&Luke Cage sucks.  I can’t watch that show.  ‘Shades’ is the worst actor I cringe whenever he is in the scene.&&I just get really sick of watching Danny Rand continually make the worst decision possible at any given moment. He is a complete dipshit.&&I’m glad someone finally said it. I don’t follow any of the comic books, but holy crap Iron Fist was unwatchable. I ended up reading a book a few episodes into the first season because it was so bad. 

By season 2 it was lowered to doing chores. Whoever cast the main character needs to watch their own shows more.&&The bar scene?

They name dropped Orsan Randall and the chi guns and gun fu were in the comics.&&Same for me too! I actually watched it straight through. Jessica Jones and Luke Cage Season 2 took me a while. It probably also helped that I was sick and decided to binge through it. &&“Hey, can I talk to you in the hallway for a second?”- Almost every episode of each CW show&&What shows are the CW shows? &&Is Legends on Netflix? &&Do you hate yourself? I only ask because I've also been watching them since Arrow S1. &&I keep hearing that Legends is amazing but it’s first season is rough. Should I just skip that season or will the rest of the show be confusing?&&The guy who plays Ward is a solid goddamn actor. &&One 18 minute take on the first shot. Insanely good episode. &&I know right? I kept rewinding sections to marvel at the acting and camera work. All of them sitting in the viewing room, getting progressively drunker and taking shots at each other. The husband who keeps trying to offer people food because he feels awkward. Even just the way the episode shifted to different areas of the room was so natural. That's how people would act in a situation like that. They don't stay neatly in one spot. They wander around.&&One of the best scenes was the dude with the cane ""walking"" by which was so slow and creepy.&&Yeah, they rarely resort to cheap jump scares, but then that makes it doubley worse when they do. I watched episode 8 last night and man they got me good. That is the first time I have legitimately screamed I was so shocked. My own fault for watching alone, in the dark, with the headphones on. &&I’m not gonna lie, I finished the whole series yesterday, didn’t find it too scary while watching, but the ghosts seem to have been in a low burn in my psyche because I’m now laid awake at 3am freaked out by the floating bowler hat man! 

Just thinking of him floating down the corridor to my room hah.  Then I think of that ghost when the mother woke up, and it was looking through her door at her and quickly moved it’s head back and now I can’t even look at my bedroom door as I type this hah! 

God someone come save me from myself &&The other books are better, or at least I enjoyed them more as a kid, particularly Voyage of the Dawntreader.&&Holy shit I forgot about that! Hopefully more episodes this time!&&Isn't it Castlevania Season 1 Part 2?&&That show is still around? I didn't finish S3 as it kinda dragged and now without its main man, no care.&&I actually agree, conjuring and hill house are both ""old-timey family in a haunted house"" and the latter is far more thought-out and consistent &&Lets do the timewarp again!&&I'll let you know I feel personally attacked by this very comment.&&It's not really that surprising, it's just viewing history.&&Too risky on its own, better diversify the portfolio with some Seirs and MySpace stock.&&It's their own content though, not Geico ads and shit. 

Netflix advertises itself the minute you log in. If that's what makes you mad you've already given them that inch and what you really want is a blank screen when you log in. No suggestions based on your preferences, no ""trending,"" no ""popular on netflix,"" just nothing. You select only from their huge catalog A-Z or manually search. &&Personally they are at my limit. Advertising their own shit heavily is fine. I PAY for Netflix and miss new shows/movies constantly so I don't mind the reminders and advertising. I'm not even forced to watch they as far as I can tell. I finish the movie, ad plays, and I can back out immediately. No harm done.

If advertisements for Gain or McDonalds start popping up we will have major issues.&&The setting was the only reason I watched. I can't think of a single likeable character^* or interesting story arc, but I stuck it through because the setting was great.

*^With ^the ^exception ^of ^Poe, ^of ^course. &&That's the point where the show diverges almost completely from the book. It's so frustrating - this series could have been amazing if they'd just stuck to the book. &&It really did fizzle out hard at the end, which was a shame. But I had gotten so much enjoyment out of it already I wasn't too upset by it, especially with the ending giving us something to look forward to.&&Yeah Altered Carbon was insanely over the top and with less talented cast and directors, it could have been an absolute cheesy mess. I loved it though, they did a fantastic job and keeping it inside the line of believability. &&Still miles behind the amount that Starz had with Spartacus...
&&I loved Altered Carbon but there were so many people I couldn’t recommend it to bc of all the nudity and violence &&At leat hbo shows got more to offer than that. &&> Apple is pushing new boundaries the opposite direction by seeing how much they can remove and still call it a show

O O F&&Apple creates shows? &&It really bums me out Apple has taken this censored family friend approached.  It’s okay to offer a range of content that appeals to the young and old but to snuff out the creativity of the creators means I hope Apple’s service fails.  You can make some great family friendly content but it’s also nice to throw in a show like the wire every so often or breaking bad.  &&What is Apple doing? &&Big Mouth would never air on TV imho. &&What are ya gonna do?&&What is it? &&Ya, the Netflix MCU stuff is definitely Marvel on HBO. &&I was really surprised when I watched Game Over, Man! and saw a dick. I don't think I've seen a  dick in a movie, like... ever.&&Sense8, and the psychic orgy.&&Sense8 comes to mind. Interesting and positive show with a hard R of NC 17 rating. &&Sausage Party evidently had to be cut to avoid an NC-17 rating and they weren't even human.&&Beleive it's the most expensive production they've done as of yet as well.. would be a shame if it doesn't get a proper cinema release.&&That accent had me in stitches. &&Yeah that's the one. One of the funniest things I've ever seen. It completely caught me off guard. &&The single shot shootout scene in the hallways was absolutely mind blowing I had to watch it twice.&&""Annie, I'm a hawk!""&&Consider the show ""inspired"" by the book.

Both are very good, and for similar reasons, but are still very different.&&I really don't care that much for cinematic techniques but goddamn that episode was shot masterfully well. Just the blocking itself must have taken forever.&&was that the episode when the whole family’s together at the funeral home? that was fantastic &&[deleted]&&Immediately after this ep all i can think about was ozymandias from breaking bad, because that is imo one of the best tv episodes ever made. And then ep 6 made me rethink my own opinion. It does this in season 1 episode 6. I dont know how they could top this year after year. Seriously amazing.&&Reminds me of Angelina Jolie&&Oh shit, he directed Hush too? It's on my watchlist and I just finished watching Hill House. Will definitely watch Hush now!&&Me too. I was quite disturbed by the reveal.&&I actually said ""what the fuck was that"" out loud when it ended, but in retrospect it was really entertaining and I don't regret watching it at all. It was like a bizarro breakfast club that left me with way more questions than I started with, and for some reason I'm okay with that. &&Omg if ya’ll haven’t seen Bojack you are MISSING OUT! stick through til season 2 you will want to watch this show multiple times.&&Did you mean Shane Lizard, my best friend?&&You mean that guy with the Harry Potter voice?&&This will be me when I have kids.&&I don’t know this one?  How is it?  Is it for little kids-ish?&&My suspicion is the 2d parts are drawn at 12 fps which is traditional for Japanese animation but since the show is a mix of 2d and 3d art you'll see parts of it that are smooth blended with parts that feel.... not as smooth.

Avatar LTA and Korra also mixed 2d with 3d but this time it seems like there's some hiccups in its production that will hopefully be sorted out in the later seasons.&&It's rendered incorrectly, I think.

They're likely just rendering scenes at a fixed rate and leaving them as is. If they want the buttery smooth animation that Pixar has, they need to render at a very high framerate (150fps+), then convert that file back down to 30fps or 24fps for broadcasting. &&There's also been stuff that was intended to be movies or at least hour-ish short movies that they've forced to be series'&&Hopefully it stays that way. I've seen it mentioned a couple of times that a couple of the comedians that will be featured in The Degenerates didn't feel they had complete freedom. I haven't been able to find an actual source for those comments though so hopefully it's not true.&&Isn't there antitrust legislation around studios producing content not being able to own the means of exhibiting the content (for example, Disney not being allowed to own movie theaters that play only Disney movies and not being able to produce movies to be played exclusively in those theaters)?&&I was thinking the other day how cool it would be if they did this and also played revival films.  They could do stuff like have a world wide synchronized Rocky Horror(that also streams at the same time) so that everyone in the first world can potentially be watching Rocky Horror at the exact same time.  Also *at least* discount tickets for subscribers or I'm out. &&I heard Netflix canceled it, but the Disney Streaming service said they should continue it, and now the Disney site might continue the show.&&I'm like 60% sure that my strategy of skipping every scene that isn't Luke punching stuff means I'm missing some of the plot, but I'm even more sure that the plot I'm missing isn't that important.&&[deleted]&&Mahershala Ali was so excellent in S1, but [then they had to go and kill him off halfway through.](#spoiler) Completely lost my interest.&&Mariah is much worse imo. Shades is the only thing keeping her interesting.&&When Luke Cage came out I thought Shades was just so hilariously gangster I went as far as to make a ghoul NPC based off him for a Fallout d&d game I was writing up. I’m surprised to see the general sentiment that folks dislike Luke Cage when I’ve always thought it was one of the better shows.

The bong rips help. &&You could skip it and be cool. Season 1 sucks. &&I honestly thought Ward was the best character in both seasons.&&The only reason I was sad that they canceled it is that we don't get to see a Ward redemption arc, not a good one anyway. What a great actor, when I think of Season 1, all I can remember is how good he was, and season 2 he gets really deep in the shit. I loved when he went with Mary to Turk and he gave Turk the pointer on his golf game. Then they finally bring him into the spotlight in the last 2 minutes and they cancel the show?! Damnit! Just when it was getting good, they blue balled the shit out of us with that season 2 ending! &&18 mins? shit! I knew it was long but 18 mins is nuts!&&Holy shit yes, that was creepy as fuck&&Haha I know exactly which jump scare you’re talking about in episode 8. Watched it last night actually. Had to watch an episode of The Flash just to make myself feel better before I went to bed lol&&I love watching scary shows and movies like that. Alone and headphones with all lights off. But I always get super creeped out and make my dog chill with me while I watch Seinfeld to cool off.  &&I don't think it's supposed to be scary so much as tense, which seemed to work on you...and me.&&8 Episodes and a third season is already in the works&&Aka season 2.&&Claire is a very powerful and assuming character. She commands quite a presence in the later seasons. &&I’d rather not be confronted head on with how many times I’ve rewatched the Mulaney specials, or The Office, or Parks and Rec, or....&&Depends. Did they list things he'd watched, or did they read off accurate metadata describing his watching habits and preferences? The latter could be much creepier, if accurate. &&Yeah but if I was meeting with a prospective client for a possible project, or even on a first date with someone, I wouldn't start with... ""so I looked through your online history and found out you liked all this stuff.""&&>You select only from their huge catalog A-Z

I WOULD IF I COULD!!
&&Binary thinking hurts.

What consumers want is analog.  Trending towards ads means at first it's just a little text ad for in-house material, but positive feedback means a slightly larger ad next, then a full-screen ad, then ads from advertisers from outside, and so on.

Unless the market speaks in a way that impacts profits, the trend will continue.&&It's still a step in the wrong direction. Fc Barcelona went from not having advertising on their uniforms to giving a spot to UNICEF for free. When people got used to seeing logos on the shirt, they sold the spots to Qatar.&&Yeah this is what I don't understand. I get people hate ads, I do too but they're not showing you a car commercial, they're showing you other content on the platform. And if it ultimately helps push out even more great content then I'm fine with it.&&I think Netflix intentionally doesn’t want that comparison. HBO is known for nudity and violence. Starz is known for that and then some. 

Netflix also creates everything from kid shows to documentaries. No reason to push that boundary when they haven’t needed to. &&“May Jupiter’s cock shine upon your cock”

It contains a fair amount of nudity. 

It gets quite a bit of criticism for the nudity and animation style, but I enjoy it.&&It's an animation about pubescent kids. The worst thing they show is pubic hair and like... vagina bush. I think one ep of season two has a female student shirtless but she's completely flat chested.

It's nowhere near as racey as people are suggesting.

Don't see how a streaming service is any different.  Same idea just a different medium.  My guess is they know how to skirt the laws haha&&Well that would give me 1 reason to subscribe to their streaming service. Unless they turn it all PG. Then it goes into the Apple bin. &&Disney has no interest in Netflix running any Disney owned content&&You're honestly not really missing anything. It felt like a redo of the bad half of season 1, but we weren't looking for a redo. I mean, overall it's better, but it wasn't that much better. Just mediocre. 

When the bullet-proof Hero of Harlem isn't always bullet-proof and gets his ass kicked all the time, it just feels contrived. I know you can't just have 13 episodes of the season 1 ~~trailer~~ [teaser](https://youtu.be/Ymw5uvViqPU)... but that's kinda the bar that was set for peak Luke Cage entertainment. Those moments are fun to watch, Luke Cage being a bad-ass. The show just needs more than 2 or 3 of those moments per season.

Additional notes: I know I'm not all too familiar with the character, and there's more than likely some cultural subtext I'm missing while watching the show, the above is just my thoughts on the show in comparison to the rest of the Netflix-Marvel series.&&Second season villain was awesome I thought, until the season ended with no real resolution and everyone just kind of going their separate ways.&&I couldn’t even finish season 2.  So many boring sub plots and nothing really held my interest.&&Agreed. Didn't even finish the rest once he died. &&They killed off an incredible character/big bad and then introduced the actual big bad which was the cheesiest, lamest bad guy I think I’ve ever seen. Loved the show until they killed Cottonmouth and then it just got terribly cringy &&Legends of Tomorrow and Black Lightning. Legends is the best and freshest superhero show out there, IMO. Granted, it’s more like Doctor Who with superheroes, which could be why I like it. &&Same here, when I finished the first season of Iron Fist, I was more intrigued with Ward's character than any of the other characters in the show. &&Yup, anyone who has watched it knows what I’m referring to! Don’t want to spoil it for anyone else who hasn’t seen it yet. Had a good laugh about it afterwards though, mostly to calm myself down. Really looking forward to watching the last couple of episodes.&&But there's a HORSE in a HOSPITAL!&&it's a brave new world, friend&&Really? You don’t ever watch random shit you see on there? &&HBO is known for high quality docuseries, period pieces, etc, as well.

Netflix does have a wider range of content, and that's one of the benefits of being a streaming service, they're not limited by time slots, they can release as much content at a time as they want to.  They do seem to be doing a lot of horror-related stuff lately, not a genre I'm a fan of, but it seems to have a fanbase.  &&Yeah, there was this random scene where one of the gladiators was just fucking the hell out of this twink with the door open. Spartacus walks by, smiles in amusement, and just keeps walking. It was the least necessary scene I'd ever witnessed in my life. It instantly became one of my favorite shows ever. &&whereas I always argued to people that, yes, it's like softcore porn, but it also has an amazing story and characters&&I Googled that ""quote"" and this Reddit thread is the only instance of it.

Boy howdy. What a babe. &&I personally think Bojack Horseman is better because the general concept is better, but it is quite a shame. &&I much prefer Bojack. After 1-2 episodes of Big Mouth I need a break. It’s funny but also a lot.&&Grind that pepper!&&Nudity as in like The Simpsons showing Bart's butt? Or more than that? I could see that being weird. &&lol wtf its a cartoon who gives a shit if theyre naked&&Naw there's quite a few animated dicks my guy.&&Swinging blue dong&&Different censorship rules for blue dicks on atom controlling mutants. You will however never see a purple dick on a telepathic alien. The rules are complex. &&Also helps that the actors are so good in that moment. The combination of the camera work and the acting brought an incessant, though not fast paced, feeling of tension and argument. It just kept building and building and the whole time the camera is just moving from one to another, all this rage just getting vented out.&&The show really steps it up starting with episode 6. Prior to that I could have given up on it...and many critics did, which is why all the early reviews were bad and all the late reviews (those who watched the whole season) were good. Which also helps explain why the rotten tomato scores for the five seasons are 65%, 100%, 100%, 97%, and 100%.&&Whoooooaaaa&&I’ve never watched the airbender but I’ve always heard it was great.  My youngest had a stork bite, which everyone referred to as the air bender.  I’m gonna watch them soon, and if I don’t have time, I’ll recruit the kids and I’ll have no other choice lol&&[deleted]&&sokKa has a voice in the show&&Yeah, you just have to live with some crummy jokes, but it's worth it. The plot is mature (your kids better be ok with the concept of death), the characters are likeable, and the villains are refreshingly fleshed out.

I especially loved the conflicting opinions on the ""evil"" magic, and that the introduction to the villains is structured so you see them as real people before it's clear who the antagonists are.&&They have no idea what they're talking about. That is not what Pixar does. 

What they will do is have a variable frame rate where some scenes will be up to 60fps but they won't render hundreds of extra frames. That eould be way too expensive and time consuming. 

Which is also why Dragon Prince has a low frame rate. Cheaper to produce when they can rent/run a render farm for half as long. &&The streaming Service will also have Jon Favreaus live action Star Wars series ""The Mandalorian"", and a rumored Loki series and Scarlet Witch series&&Disney will have my subscription if they put all episodes of Gargoyles on there&&Well shit, I loved Luke Cage season 2 after not really caring about the first season. It's my third favorite Marvel/Netflix series behind The Punisher season 1 and Daredevil season 1.&&Spoilers ahead. Like, twins absolutely run a town as reputable but corrupt city councilwoman and owner of a famous, glitzy, front nightclub? I am *in.* She's facing a tough re-election and burgeoning scandal and he's trying to regain control after getting in over his head with an arms deal gone wrong? That's a dope story with some deep, interesting villians. Then, they throw that shit out the window for an arms dealer who wants nothing more than to hurt/kill the hero and harm civilians to make that happen because *gasp* he's actually the hero's spurned half brother? I've never been so disappointed by the direction a show has gone midseason.&&They lean into the campy/dorkyness and it absolutely works. Looking forward to the new season. &&Its October, so more people want to watch horror related stuff. Definitely a good move on Netflix's part to release all this stuff in time for Halloween&&They gotta pump out horror stuff for the Halloween crowd.&&They created a new category for horrors called Netflix and chills.&&I remember one scene where they slowly zoom in on a man and a woman having sexy times. Then they cut and start zooming out and it's changed into man on man action. I felt like they tricked me into watching softcore gay porn.&&That was pretty much the only way they established that the twink and the big black guy were together though.  It was actually super important for establishing that part of the story.&&That makes me more proud than I’m willing to admit. &&Just looked it up....yesm. &&It was all about Dichen Lachman for me &&I like bojack, but as someone who has depression and a former addict.... That show can be a bit heavy and not something I'd watch just for an easy laugh. Some of the nihilistic humor of bojack hits a bit close to home &&Ya but Bojack is maybe on it's 4 season I think. I'd argue that's it's not a new show yet&&They’re so different in my mind for whatever reason. Maybe the type of animation. Love both of them though 

But Big Mouth makes me have to hide my phone when I’m watching on the subway haha &&That's how I feel about Bojack. It's such a great show, but after one episode, I feel literally exhausted.&&I think that's the beauty of it. Its funny but it's also almost painfully relatable in its very in your face depiction of what growing up in such an awkward and cringey point of everyone's lives is like. It sucks you in because you understand but it also makes you want to look away. It's perfect.&&I'm watching through the first season right now. There's full on animated dongs, vaginas, and boobs all throughout it. It's very crude, essentially it's about kids going through puberty and ""Hormone monsters"" are the devil's on their shoulders telling them to follow their urges no matter how bad they are.

I think it's hilarious, but it's not for the faint of heart. My girlfriend definitely doesn't like it as much as I do. And they do go into territory very few other animated shows would go to, including South Park and the other ""mature"" animated shows.&&Full discussions between pubic hairs.&&Male and female full frontal nudity.&&1st season of TLA is a bit ""little kids-ish"". 2nd season it starts getting good.&&I'd say its more like a mix of dungeons and dragons + the last airbender, with the fire nation getting replaced by racist elves.

&&No! No need for that&&Plus the new season of the clone wars among other things. Hate to say it but the Disney streaming service is likely gonna be a must. At least for me. &&First half of Daredevil Season 2 with the Punisher shits on everything. &&Season one of Jessica Jones should be up there too mate. The way they portrayed trauma and PTSD was haunting.&&Different strokes I guess.  Glad you enjoyed it!
Edit:  I like punisher and daredevil s1 a lot too.&&I think they just put too much in one season. I would have been perfectly happy with the whole first season being taking down Cottonmouth. Diamondback should have been kept in the shadows. Season one should have stopped with Mariah walking out of prison. 

That said, I also get really tired of this convention of having a superhero’s villains motivated more by personal hatred of the hero than by their own greed or lust for power or other outside motivations. It weakens the villains completely. They should hate (or better not, just want to remove) the hero for being in their way and opposing their goals,  not for some bullshit with their father. 

That kind of stuff has weakened so many villains. From the last Bond movie (blofeld is his step-brother?) to all of the Fanastic 4 movies (Doom should not be evil because Sue rejected him). Kingpin and Daredevil clash not because they needed family therapy, but because they have opposing views of what Hell’s Kitchen should be. &&People said this about Flash too, calling it ""meta"" and shit, but that's giving waaayy too much credit IMO. The shows are campy, and characters like Cisco will sometimes acknowledge the ridiculousness of a situation if it involves a whacky obsure character from the comics or something, but I don't think the shows are actually that self-aware of their stupidity. They are filled with so much unironic melodrama and monologuing.

I respect the enjoyment of the shows, but I feel like I'm going crazy every time I hear people talk about them. I remember when Daredevil season 1 came out and people said it was ""on par"" with Flash and I thought I was going to walk into traffic.&&It's a shame that we won't get any more Stranger Things in time for halloween this year. But at least it will premier in time next year to make a bitchin' halloween costume. I was a little disappointed last year when it premiered too late for anyone to be sporting new Stranger Things costumes.  &&You were watching Spartacus. That entire show was softcore gay porn, the part they snuck in was all the softcore straight porn. &&I don't know, I got the idea in the scene before it where the gladiator told the twink he was going to pour a bunch of cum down his throat. 

... Starz is so extra. &&It gets easier. Everyday it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it everyday, that's the hard part. But it does get easier.&&Not a former addict but as someone that currently deals with depression i love Bojack. Some episodes are definitely difficult to watch, the stupid piece of shit episode is the main example for me, its the only show i enjoy that explores the issues i deal with in a relatable way. At least for me, everyone's gonna be different. &&Watching that show is like listening to the call of the void for me. &&Season 5 just came out and it was fantastic &&Yet, but maybe in a few years it will be new.&&Big Mouth has such a narrow focus. I'm having trouble getting through the second season because I don't really want to watch a show that is completely about sexuality.

Bojack covers a broad range of topics and all the main characters have pretty complex lives. &&Oh boy, just wait for season 2 if you think the first is crude&&To add a little more info to that; 90% of the nudity are from 12-14 year olds&&There is no war in Ba-Sing-Se... &&Yeah, but as you watch it - and I've watched the whole thing - you realize the elves have good reason to be hating the humans >!of whom some may not be entirely human (the butterfly scene) but are pretty much pawns of evil themselves!< and all is not what it seems. Also, while they do rehash (or perhaps pastche would be a better way of saying it) several themes and tropes from both *Dungeons & Dragons* and *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, it's not not directly drawing from either source, but is its own beast. As, IMHO, a lovely little beastie it is too.&&Piracy is the answer.&&Some people just love brooding big dick energy. &&Lucy Lawless naked is all that I needed to see.

So what episode is that? 

Pure curiosity. &&Suck a dick, dumbshits!&&Not sure how your mental state is currently, but for me, for a long time I really had to take myself away from self depreciating humor. Stuff like bojack, shameless, it's great for reminding myself the non glamorous parts of my life, but even it being framed in a humorous way... I'll still get that bored of normal life feeling watching those types of shows. That's when I really gotta step away because that bored feeling has fucked me up way too many times &&and had two episodes which would easily make it to the best episodes of 2018.&&Yeah but all of it’s educational, absurd or gross out humor.

Bruce Willis film 'Air Strike' canceled after co-star Fan Bingbing disappears,34574,9oze1k,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/10/17/bruce-willis-film-canceled-after-co-star-fan-bingbing-disappears/1668153002/,2895,1539788321.0,,"That is a seriously incomplete article. I have so many questions.&&So the movie is done, but they canceled the release?&&funny enough, photos of (allegedly) her were released today&&Is it odd to anyone else to cancel the movie days before release?  
And what's with Willis going the NIck Cage route with his movie choices these days?&&She didn't disappear she was kidnapped by a nightmare government.&&Anyone check the Saudi consulate in Istanbul?&&> Fan posted an apology on her official Weibo account saying that she accepted the tax authorities' decision and would ""try my best to overcome all difficulties and raise funds to pay back taxes and fines.""

> ""I am unworthy of the trust of the society and let down the fans who love me,"" she wrote in her first update of her Weibo.com microblog since June 2.

Sounds like a **totally** legitimate statement **definitely** not orchestrated by government who's *probably* seizing her assets and currently shipping her off to a labor camp (or 're-educating' her in various ways so she **knows** that a prison camp will be her next destination for any further perceived slights against them).&&Wait, she disappeared again?!&&This timeline makes absolutely no sense.

Fan Bingbing has been missing for **3 months**.

Today she was seen and news was published at 6:28 EST.

At 7:36 EST, the movie was cancelled because ""co-star Fan Bingbing disappears"".

Like she has been missing for 3 months... silence. She is found and an hour later you IGNORE that and cancel the movie?

Sketchy.&&Such a strangely composed article. So she wrote something on her website after she disappeared? And what does the government capping the percentage of production budget a single person can get have to do with this? It says the film was scheduled to be released in a couple weeks.. How would her disappearance affect the release? I have so many more questions after reading that article..&&$130M in taxes??? wtf!&&Lol, the Chinese government is so full of shit. Who do they really think they are kidding? Along with any other government who forces a confession and public apology or risk death or concentration camp?&&How about Die Hard China where he goes and rescues her?&&It’s nice that USATODAY report a story that 4 weeks old.&&That's like when Milhouse went missing and they had to shelf the Radioactive Man movie. &&There's a link in the article to another article from Oct 3 about how she has resurfaced and agrees to pay $130 million in charges&&Chinese here, She was recently fined 880million RMB(about 140MM USD) for tax evasion and a few other things, she paid the fine to avoid prison and probably wanted to hide from the public for a while after the settlement.
&&She's being replaced by Hater Googlegoogle.&&But didn't she un-disappear?

Either way, I do hope she and her family are someday able to relocate from mainland China to Hong Kong or Taiwan.&&Funny thing with Bruce Willis, after The Siege came out al Qaeda bombed his Planet Hollywood Restaurant in South Africa as retribution &&Isn't she a huge star across Asia? &&She pulled a Wesley Snipes, except she ran instead of allowing herself to be arrested.&&She visit any Saudi consulates?&&Not Bingbing!! I liked her. 😭&&TIL Chinese Hollywood has a salary cap.&&I am not sure where she is expected to get $130 million from. Presumably her work has dried up and chances of being able to pay this fine is absolutely zero. She's have to be earning at Beyonce levels to pay this.&&Did she walk in to a Saudi Consulate, too?&&The movie looks [unbelievably bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJjMggOUu8).&&I heard she was missing in a BLINK of an eye.&&I’d recommend checking the Saudi embassy in Turkey &&Deep Fakes will handle this ""missing person""&&With some movie titles...you just know...it was going to be a really bad movie.&&She evaded those taxes so hard she disappeared.&&It makes a lot of sense for the government to target celebrities. This allows them to make tax enforcement highly visible, without actually rounding up huge numbers of people. I don’t know the specifics or how the Chinese justice system works or whatever, but honestly in the US rich and famous people too often get soft treatment when they commit crimes. Maybe there’s something to say for the Chinese approach. &&So to be clear, this movie was complete enough to be coming out in a couple weeks, and yet somehow they can't finish/release it without this woman?

This stinks of covering for political action/censorship by the Chinese.&&> a cameo in the Chinese version of ""Iron Man 3,""

I'm intrigued&&The film isn’t canceled because she “disappeared”, it got canceled for the same reason as why she disappeared.

She got investigated for tax fraud when a personal feud (she began filming a film that had a negative caricature of another celeb) caused another famous person to release a secret contract of her for this exact film. The contract basically promised her about 6 million USD on top of her reported income for tax purposes for like three days of filming.

 It was pretty clear from both the trailer and the contract that the film was a money laundering scheme. 

Fan got investigated as a result of the contract.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the film’s producers are being/might be investigated, too, along with the rest of the cast.

Also she’s been seen at airports and places so she’s not missing. She has to pay back taxes and about two times that in fines by the end of the year to avoid jail time. &&Just saw the trailer for this and it looks like a career low for Bruno. I mean wow the CGI was so terrible Top Gun in 1985 looked better. He's phoning it in so badly now.&&I'll give you some context: this actually all started because of a celebrity feud, of all things.

Once upon a time...like, 90s? There was a Chinese talk show that was a national sensation. Ended in like 09 (CORRECTION: Late 2003-2004, which makes the next bit even more timely). The host, Cui Yonyuan, was a huge celebrity known for his integrity, wit, and candour, by most accounts a stand up guy. 

In 2003, along comes a pretty famous Chinese director Feng xiaogang, who says to Cui, I wanna make a movie about a talk show host, please let me into your life. So cui does. The result is a movie called cell phone, a pretty decent dramedy. 

Unfortunately the plot of the movie is not kind to the host. Not only are the characters pretty direct correlations to real people (like if you wanted to mention Tom cruise but you called your guy Tim roam, that level of not-a-disguise), but the plot of the movie involved the host sleeping with his protege, who then used it as blackmail leverage to replace him as the host of the show.

 In real life, Cui was indeed replaced by his protege, He Jing. The affair is obviously not confirmed but this film likely did nonzero amounts of damage to the real proteges career and the program was cancelled after a year.

Fan binging played the protege in the movie. A sequel to Cell Phone is coming out. So the talk show host Cui finally lost his shit.

He posts all the dirt he's got on Chinese twitter, calling out the director Feng and Fan bingbing,  including the tax evasion contract. At this point fan was supposedly in America when the story broke. For a while Chinese netizens were speculating that she was gonna seek asylum. 

Which brings us to the secret arrest. I speculate that the govt offered her a deal to avoid further suspicion and international attention, but who really knows. There are also allegations that she made comments critical of the govt shortly before this arrest but China hasn't talked about it at all, since the narrative is that it all started with the talk show host.

Edit: names have been added for clarification.&&The timeline is super sketchy.

Movie cancelled 1 hour and 2 minutes after she has been seen for the first time in 3 months. They cite her disappearance as the reason and mention NOTHING of her reappearing in public 1 hour earlier.&&With the Chinese government involved.. good luck getting any real answers. &&Seriously.

>Fan has starred in dozens of movies and TV series in China and is best known internationally for her role as Blink in 2014's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" a cameo in the Chinese version of ""Iron Man 3,"" and for star turns on the red carpet at Cannes as recently as May.

There were scenes filmed in the MCU that are region-specific?? &&Nothing happening.

Do not ask.

Her family say everything ok.

She just not want to work in American pig movie.

Go Chinese government. #1&&> I have so many questions.

So do the people who want to find Fan Bingbing. :(&&Is she dead? This is the type of high profile ""disappearing"" that should cause some civil unrest...&&Like the fact that they link to [their own article from October 3rd that says she already reappeared and said she would pay her taxes.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/10/03/china-orders-x-men-actress-fan-bingbing-pay-130-million-tax-fine/1507103002/) lol&&Earns $7.5M, owes $129M in fines+taxes...?  What kind of tax system do they have in place?  I’d probably hide too.  &&You answers will only be answered when China becomes a democracy. I will be optimistic and say 25 years.&&Forget it Jake. It's China.&&Yeah wtf? It says they worked on it for 8 years and it was going to be released in two weeks! Wtf??? &&This was a direct to DVD movie in the states and potentially a box office flop in China. With all the negative Fan publicity this film was doomed. &&Sounds like an insurance scam to recover money from a movie that they think will flop. &&What the EFF?!&&I thought I read she had been released in the past week or two.&&he's been doing that a lot lately, the only movie where he does seem to give a crap acting-wise is Glass&&I can actually answer that second question, because the answer actually makes me kind of proud of Willis.

Per an interview with a stunt guy who often doubles for Bruce Willis, you can get Willis to be in your terrible direct to video movie for $1 million a day, plus first class airfare, and a 5star hotel suite for him.

If I was an aging actor, I’d ruin my acting legacy for $1million a day.&&Aside from John McClane in the *Die Hard* series, Willis doesn't have any big franchise options to keep him busy. He likes to work, or he likes the money, or probably both, so he signs on for the projects he likes.

If he didn't, we wouldn't have movies like *Surrogates*, which is a hidden gem.&&Hey, Nick Cage’s movie Mandy was the best &&The director claims he's been working on the movie for 8 years.

Having a release for October 26th says it's gotta be done.

So why not just release it?&&And only Bruce Willis can save her?

Coming this summer. In a world...&&Just what is with Russia and China either blatantly assassinating people or kidnapping them in the last couple of years? Are the higher ups gaining power, so they don't bother to be discrete knowing they can't be knocked off their thrones. Or are they losing so much power that they want to send a message to the world not mess with them because they are willing to do anything to keep what waning power they have? &&And now seen in Beijing.

[https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/10/17/actress-fan-bingbing-seen-beijing-china-sot-vpx.cnn](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/10/17/actress-fan-bingbing-seen-beijing-china-sot-vpx.cnn)&&Did she really evade taxes?   If so, an arrest for tax evasion isn't a kidnapping.

China has two tiers of enforcement.  Average poor person who does whatever the fuck they want and rich people who comply with the government or go to jail.  It creates a system where most people have no problems with government.  If you run into problems, its only because you got rich so people blame the rich person for acting out.&&There's pictures of her in public today.&&Yeah, totally a nightmare to have a government that actually enforces rules on rich.&&She evade taxes, for 40 fucking million dollars!!! Do you guys call arresting kidnapping from where you came from?  Why try to talk about something like you know a lot, but actually you know nothing about? That only makes you look more stupid.&&what would happen if she requested asylum in the usa or canada or germany?&&Hello, this is China - we just need you to come in for some questioning. Nothing too serious - pack a bag though- maybe tell your family you love them. &&Yep her wrongdoing was exposed by another famous Chinese talk show host Yongyuan Cui. She had one public contract and one private contract with the movie producer company where the private one indicates a crazy amount income, but she only pays tax for the tiny income indicated on the public contract to escape from tax.&&Public apologies are not that uncommon as a part of a plea deal even in the West (see Johnny Depp’s Australian hostage video) , and definitely not for celebrities caught doing something bad. 

Her sentence does not include prison on the condition she pays back the taxes and fines since it was some sort of IRS or the Chinese equivalent violation and not a criminal offense apparently unless she doesn’t pay fines.

I don’t think people realize that she wasn’t targeted. A well-known personal feud caused someone to  release contracts on social media proving she evaded taxes and the IRS had to investigate the case to avoid losing face.  &&Is she actually facing time in a labor camp? Where is this info coming from? Is that the punishment the tax officials sentenced her to?

Do you have actual evidence that this public apology was coerced? That her evading taxes is a sham?&&I thought it was your day to watch her.&&I just googled her and she reappeared today apparently.&&Remember when Louis CK was about to release a new movie directed by Woody Allen and it just so happened that 'Me Too' broke out that exact same day?

They not only canceled the premier, they canned the entire movie

It's just bad publicity to have her around.  I mean at least this movie doesn't have anything to do with taxes whereas Louis CK's movie was about him and an underage girl  *yuck*

&&Thanks for that. Yeah I thought she’d been missing for months and had just resurfaced.

This makes no sense.&&Any theories?&&On tax evasion charges for 7.5 million. WTF indeed&&They don't think they're kidding anyone.

China does shit like this all the time. Now they can lock her in a camp for it or something. &&There were news recently that said she sold 41 apartments/houses recently and I guess she also has a lot of liquid money, shares and so on.&&Jesus, you could fairly easily fake that someone wasn't missing with as little oversight as they have plus modern editing tech, couldn't you?&&Well, Top Gun in 1985 mostly used actual footage of F-14's, so...&&The only CG in top gun were the guns firing. Everything else, including the missile launches, were real.&&Eh, this doesn't look like it was intended to be watched by Western audiences. It looks like a film that was produced specifically for the Chinese market, and they just threw some cash at some recognizable American actors who hadn't had a hit in a while to give the film a faux-prestige image in China.&&There must be a reasonable explanation for why Bruce Willis got himself into Straight To Video Purgatory....... demands too much $? Is he an A-hole? Does he just not care anymore?

&&If you called your main dude Tim Roam I would never get the reference until a Redditor like you pointed it out.&&What a saga.

That should have solved everything. /s&&[deleted]&&And to think, I got all this information without having to click no 3 times on pop ups asking if I wanted to pay $9.99 a month to USA Today. Who in their right mind would pay that for a garbage news site that looks like it was for a highschool end of the year project and supplies no news. I founf like three typos in that article alone.

Edit: Typo is staying. It's hilariously in the perfect spot. &&If this started out with a feud, then it has spread across the entire industry. I have a relative that works in the HK film industry and he said everything suddenly dried up. Only the established guys are surviving now.  Apparently, this ""2-contract"" thing was widespread, and now that they've cracked down, huge swaths of people can't get work anymore.&&Wesley Snipes went to jail because he couldn’t pay tens of millions in tax and fines. 

She evades $170 million in taxes by having two contracts, reporting the much lower contract to the tax man. She got away with paying a fine and an apology. 

Apparently she has already paid all of her fines “mind-boggling” and will not have a criminal record as this is a first offence and that she complied with her fine. How is that not a sweat deal? So what if the movie is not coming out, she is clearly loaded for life.&&That explains the ""Fan Bingbing disappears"" part, but why should that be a reason to cancel a film that apparently was already finished (set to release Oct. 26)?

""State media said Fan evaded taxes by using two separate contracts for her work on ""Air Strike."" - that sounds like the production company was complicit in her tax evasion by giving her two separate contracts. But that still doesn't explain the cancellation.

Also ""director Xiao Feng posted on his Weibo miniblog Wednesday that it was ""time to let go"" after eight years of work on the film."" - So did the director make that decision? What about the international distribution partners who were already set for an October release? They probably don't care about Chinese taxes and would still want to release the movie internationally. Or maybe the director was only talking about the Chinese release?

&&Context porn.&&Man, you could make a whole movie about this shit&&I’m still confused, what has fan bingbing done wrong here? It sounds like the protege who took over the hosts job was blackmailing him, and bingbing played a character in the movie?  Sounds like she hasn’t done anything wrong.&&China has a long and recent history of jailing, torturing, and making political dissenters disappear.

Having a missing acctress, even if just for tax evasion, looks bad&&> I speculate that the govt offered her a deal to avoid further suspicion and international attention

Then they just disappeared her and gained even more international attention.&&Also the movie is cancelled when it was set to premier in 1 week? How does that make sense? Why would her disappearance or legal issues matter, outside of hurting the films box office in china? Especially when it had 2 worldwide known actors, and probably couldve pulled in a few million at minimum in the US alone with zero marketing.

>The World War II thriller, also starring Bruce Willis and Adrien Brody, **was to have been released Oct. 26.**&&Wouldn't it take some doing to cancel a movie? I mean with lawyers and such you'd think it would take more than an hour. Maybe it was in the works for a bit&&Don't bother googling for it either.  Google's in China's pocket already.&&We have answers in this black van over here...&&Pretty simple. The black bagged her to a re-education camp for tax evasion. China is corrupt as fuck and this serves a purpose. See, when everybody in the movie industry in China uses the same tax dodges, it means even if it's not strictly legal, everybody will do it because it's just what everybody does. There are so many illegal things in China, the culture tends to build itself around what you can get away with and not be hassled. However, since just about everything is technically illegal, the party can black bag whoever they want at any time. Right now China's president is consolidating his power and striking fear into the hearts of his allies and enemies by black bagging two of the highest profile Chinese people in the world, Fan Bingbing and the head of Interpol. ""If I can do it to them, I can do it to you, stay in line.""&&I found it there. Seems to be some tax evasion as of now. But who knows. &&Just looked it up. Apparently they added 4 minutes of china-only scenes. A couple in the beginning that were blatant product placements for milk and a weird scene with dr.wu where fan makes a 15 second appearance with 1 spoken line&&Apparently only for China:

https://kotaku.com/why-many-in-china-hate-iron-man-3s-chinese-version-486840429&&They consider China to be a huge market, so they pander to them by making Chinese-specific scenes. In Iron Man 3 for example, Stark has to go to China because of some complication with his heart, and there's only this one Chinese doctor that can help him. It's slap bang in the middle of the movie, and he goes to China and then is immediately back in New York.&&IIRC, when Iron Man III came out, China was only admitting a set number of American movies into theaters for the year. In order to get selected, the producers added an entire sub-plot several minutes in length in which Chinese doctors (played by famous Chinese actors) discuss performing heart surgery on Tony Stark to remove the metal from his heart. The American version of the film also has a very brief shot of him going in for surgery at the end of the movie to suggest that the got the metal removed. &&There is no war in Ba Sing Se. &&Taiwan #1&&You joke but here is one of her more recent statements on her official social media regarding the situation.  

""Without the favorable polices of the Communist Party and state, without the love of the people, there would have been no Fan Bingbing""

This was part of an overall larger apology about her tax evasion.  &&> She just not want to work in American pig movie.

If only

Getting pretty sick of Hollywood pandering to the Chinese market. It's all so forced.&&The movie is Chinese led and funded, and the tax evasion allegations regarding Fan Bingbing were directly resultant from this film.  Which means the production company is also under attack.

Given the Chinese State owns the production company, the distribution company, and pretty much everyone involved... it shouldn't be surprising they're holding back the film when releasing it would just be criticism and attention to the situtation.&&Yea wtf??? &&If everyone held on to their shit for 2 weeks I'd know what this 8 year in the making movie looks like! And if Kevin Spacey kept his mouth shut for a little longer I'd know how House of Cards ends.

It definitely would lose money, but pulling the movie is like burning your house down after you spilled tomato sauce on the carpet, it makes zero sense.

Especially if the filming location is somewhere awesome.

I was actually just watching *The Hitman's Bodyguard* and had the thought that filming location is probably something that figures into the decisions of a lot of actors who just want to cash in on their recognition. I mean, that movie is incredibly run-of-the-mill ""frenemies"" action comedy. Very predictable character development, plot,  jokes, action--everything. The whole film felt like it wasn't trying to accomplish anything but to simply exist. Yet, it had both Ryan Reynolds (post-deadpool) *and* Samuel L. Jackson as leads. There's no way you can convince me that those guys gave a shit about making a great film. I think they just wanted to get paid and spend a bunch of time in beautiful European cities.

Which I can respect.&&All about that paper, I can respect that. &&He's probably close to retiring. It's probably best to do a bunch of high paying, easy jobs in a short time and then just ""retire"".

Disappearing a person and arresting them are solidly different, at least in the laws of countries I'm familiar with&&> Did she really evade taxes? If so, an arrest for tax evasion isn't a kidnapping.

I'd say the short answer would be, who knows? Tax evasion is rampant in China but the Chinese government is also horrible. I'd say she was likely evading taxes. This entire incident stems from someone posting supposed contracts of hers on social media right before she disappeared. The contracts are known as Yin-Yang contracts. One shows the actual amount she is being paid and the other is a lesser amount which she would then report on her taxes. Yin-Yang contracts are very common in China. Was she evading taxes? More than likely since the entertainment industry in China is full of these contracts. Could it have been something else? Definitely. 

I'd have to guess China is in the midst of a crackdown on tax evasion and they wanted to set an example. &&So like the opposite of what happens in the US?&&Hong Kong actors working in China apparently, in a shocking display of total ignorance, sign these bogus contracts where they get paid their take-home less taxes and rely entirely on the production company to pay the taxes on their behalf. Of course, pretty often, the taxes don't get paid. 

Someone with a grudge reported her on the off-chance that she had one of these contracts and that the usual had occured. She had and it had. 

She was under house-arrest for a few months while the government investigated. She paid what she owed in taxes and a warning has been issued to anyone coming to work in China not to sign one of these contracts, no matter how common they are. 

Bottom line - you earn the money, you owe the tax, and don't rely on anyone else to be honest on your behalf. &&[deleted]&&Unless you're the [wrong religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China) and the government wants to harvest your organs. &&And how is she going to do that from prison or whatever black site she's in?&&you know what why don't you go ahead and bring them too&&No it's not too serious.

Otherwise, possibly something where the actual act of making money on the film would be the criteria by which the production has been found to break the law and open to prosecution?

When the handover back to China happened in 1997, the UK made China promise to let HK do it's own thing - but China was never going to honor that and the agreement was really more a way for China to receive less crap from the West at a period in its history where it was still solidifying its position in the international community.

Also just to show how China controls the narrative:

https://youtu.be/VPw86POQCdI

 People outside China were concerned for Fan Bingbing's welfare. It wouldn't surprise me if the story was quite small/played down in China (but I don't know what the reaction in China was.)

During the 2014 protests in HK I actually lived in Mainland China. Had no idea what was happening till I went to HK for a holiday. 

So the idea that they were told don't release that movie.... not too far fetched.&&It's propaganda. Damage control. 

Sometimes, I feel like some governments haven't adapted to social media and how fast things like this can spread now.  The Chinese government has been pulling so much shady shit all over the world. They're also trying to place their own people into government positions in other countries via bribes and don't even hide it. &&She's probably been told to keep a low profile for a while, until everything has completely blown over.

I actually enjoyed it very much. But it wasn't exactly a creative or surprising movie. It was very formulaic, but it was still fun!&&> I imagine that most actors feel the same way

I've been acting since I was 8 and I'm 44 years old. You're right. Any actor looks like a idiot when they start talking about their artistic integrity. The truth is you'll take what you can get no matter how big or small. Sometimes you get the ""rising star"" that gets too big for his britches and says, ""I won't do commercials"" or ""day player rolls"" but they quickly forget about that after the eventual first lull and they need to go back to flipping tables. You might have an agent or a manager that keeps you away from certain projects if they have something bigger in mind but most of the time they're pimping you out for whatever you can get. They tell you what you will or won't be auditioning regardless of what you want. That's if they're lucky, good or reputable enough to get you an audition. If an actor starts picking and choosing they'll be dropped. Acting is the most emasculating job in the world. Someone chooses your auditions, chooses you for the part, your wardrobe, your lines, your blocking, the angle the camera shoots you and how you're lit. They might even take you out of the final cut. You don't have a say in anything except stopping being an actor.&&That explains his law and order character.&&> once I hit my first few million where I could live rich for the rest of my life

This depends on your lifestyle.  Sure, I could technically take $5 million, drop it in low risk investments and live a modest lifestyle for the rest of my life off the interest.  However, most people, if they came into possession of $5 million, would not actually do that.

Because of the internet and non-stop news it seems like the whole world is at war even though we are in the most peaceful era in history.
A guy in Wisconsin hears about a Russian assassination attempt in England an hour after it happens now. That's very recent.

The Saudis tried to hide the murder of that journalist. They hid from cameras and discreetly removed the body. They even tried to lie and say it wasnt them. 24 hours later everyone with a cellphone has seen the video of the journalist going in the building and not coming out.

Cant hide from the internet.&&I think the point being made is that this has been an ongoing crisis since the Cold War, if not longer. Not to say we shouldn't be railing against what's going on, but to think that it's only been happening for a few years is incredibly naive.

(I chose the kindle link, since the bad reviews seem to largely be due to poor print quality on the prints available there - rather than content)

It's very readable, by a guy who was widely considered a bloody genius polymath who had travelled/lived all over. What happened is that someone begged him to explain China to outsiders, and considered him the best for the job - and he obliged. To me what makes it great is that it's not just an accurate explanation of China and the Chinese, but rather the perspective on China and the Chinese from a bloody genius who has found a way to have a huge appreciation of it.

One thing I've got to mention about it is that it was written in 1935 - before the Communist revolution. Despite that, it holds remarkably true. It's the stuff that passes down through families that no one can knock out of them. You'll also see him expressing himself like a guy from that generation - a bunch of casual stereotyping, maybe a bit of dabbling in eugenics and such. It's not the guy, but how communication was at the time. It provides a bit of side-interest and the signal still comes through.

As a bonus, it immediately allowed me to enjoy a lot of HK movies much more (especially obvious wherever they've actually got traditional Taoist/transient, Buddhist/naive, Confucian/career-minded, dangerous ghost women, etc. archetypes). Also does a good job of explaining Chinese art composition and relationship to Chinese calligraphy and such, and accurately points out that Chinese (still do) really tend to look down on anything that doesn't involve more than what's there at face value - and makes a pretty compelling case for why that is.

Extra note: A couple years later, I stumbled upon a little (translated) ancient Chinese quote/short-story in defence of chaos/disorder which struck me as one of the most wonderful things I'd ever seen. I was interested enough in it that I looked it up.. and discovered that Lin Yutang was the translator (Edit: I think I was probably wrong - I think someone else translated it).&&Liberals are always going after poor Ted Cruz./s&&Lyin' Tom Cruz &&Pretty decent tunes, actually&&VHS sexxxx&&Mmm...

It also helps when you don't really know the meaning of words, but understand the logograms (or the logogram radicals) can give you an overall idea of what is going on.

It’s him. &&Who is his team?&&Let him make Space Jam and any video game movie he wants. &&Seriously though, this is going to be the story of so many awesome things that never get made.&&I love this man. &&I think I’d start actually going to Twitch.com if John Carpenter has a channel on there.&&John Carpenter is one of the all time kings of practical effects. If he comes back to direct I hope he insists on using them over CGI. The monster scenes from 1982 The Thing still freak me out while 2011 The Thing prequel I thought was rather *meh.*&&I want to be at the level of John Carpenter where I can say I'm not going to do stuff because I'd rather spend time playing video games.&&_NBA Jam - The Movie_&&/r/2meirl4meirl&&Turns out John Carpenter and I have a lot in common&&I remember hearing that he wanted to devote his life to becoming good at Destiny 2&&It always blows my mind how many celebrities love to play games. The older ones especially, since it was a trend that could've gone either way with them. 

It's awesome. &&He's John carpenter.

He doesn't need to do more.

And now he's living the dream. &&#One of us! One of us!!!&&Is he going to get and play cyberpunk? I feel like he would like it.&&Awesome! Do a film about some kind of ancient magical thing allows video game characters come to life wreaking havoc and murderous rampages at a remote NBA training camp.  &&Can't blame him after winning that million on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&&No mention of a sequel to Big Trouble in Little China, but fingers crossed anyway.&&TIL John Carpenter is me. Currently watching Bulls-Bucks preseason game and I plan on playing Destiny 2 after this. &&John Carpenter and I should hang&&/r/nottheonion&&I had no idea he directed the NBA.&&Fahrenheit 451&&Kinda like the Canucks apparently.&&He will make a great movie if he doesn't have much money to spend on it.  His best films are the ones that bad a tiny budget.  *Halloween* was made on a budget of 350k.  That film had a huge impact on horror films sin e it departed so much from what horror films were previously.&&He should add me on steam&&Heard he’s playing Destiny 2 nowadays &&I bet he plays Eve-Online&&This is such a Carpenter thing to say and I really enjoy that.&&TIL that I am John Carpenter. &&From 2013 

""My son got me interested in console video games,"" he said. ""The first game I remember playing obsessively was Sonic the Hedgehog ... I have many favorite games. Borderlands 2 is spectacular. I love BioShock, the Dead Space series, The Last of Us...""&&Here is an actual answer.

https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/john-carpenter-s-top-six-games-of-2013/1100-4814/&&Well he definitely played ""The Thing"" video game. &&Far Cry 5


-From his twitter&&John Carpenter should *make* a video game. Who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to make a game directed by John Carpenter?&&Giant Bomb somehow got him to provide them with his favorite games of the year in both 2013 and 2014:

I’m sure you can just google “giant bomb + John Carpenter” and find them!&&He plays more Stardew Valley than he would admit&&He was pretty insane on Who Wants to be a Millionaire&&GTAO&&Shaq Fu&&Being such an inspiration he's the reason a lot of them even exist.&&I feel like he would enjoy Dead Space&&Spore&&I have not given that game a fair shot &&He seems more like a blood dragon type ;)&&Shocking right? It really threw me when I read that lol&&Quick, somebody ask him about the ""round earth"" theory.&&That fucking Myers boomed me&&That explains escape from Los Angeles&&It's a typo, he's an /r/nba fan.&&John Carpenter has to be a shitposter on r/nba. I bet my life on it!&&News to me too. Makes me damn happy though.&&apparently Carpenter hates talking about his movies. if you ever meet him don't ask him about his movies, ask him about sports and he'll talk with you for an hour&&I wonder if he thinks Markelle Fultz is a bust or if the Lakers will win a ship with Bron &&It apparently is the Lakers. I found [this interview](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/20/john-carpenter-sunday-conversation/3002649/) from 2013, where he says:

>We're not going to do very well this year, but I like the Lakers. We got decimated last year. What a bad year that was. Ooof.  
>  
>There are a lot of great teams. I hate the Miami Heat. *Hate* them. And I hate them for a bunch of different reasons, but they're very good.

So, he hated the LeBron Heat, but a lot of people did. I'm guessing Laker fans feel differently about James today.

&#x200B;&&Talks about basketball a lot on twitter always interesting to see him weigh in on feee agency. Kind of love when the movie and sports worlds collide as those are usually two separate chunks of my twitter. &&Dude is playing his life backwards. &&Would pay MSRP if he produced a game, though. Easily.&&This can’t be upvoted enough!!! Bring back Plisken.&&Escape from Flat Earth co-staring Kyrie&&Or make a metal gear solid film &&Love both of those movies.&&I bet the aliens will be hella scary this time.&&Dead Space Jam&&I cant believe that they are finally actually making Space Jam 2&&The thought of this makes me erect &&A live action Dead Space movie with practical effects and little CGI?

Where's the Kickstarter&&Yes please.&&the dream&&[deleted]&&Wasn’t there a game based off of his work last gen? Was super body horror demonic?&&How about instead he does a live action Dead Space or  live action Last of Us.&&I always think of Clive Barker's Undying. He really gave the game a unique style.&&V.R.

Oh, my good word. I don't think I'd be able to play any VR game Carpenter had anything to do with.

The chest scene from The Thing still gives me chills…&&Could we please have The Thing video game in the same style as Life is Strange? &&I don't think there's that much overlap&&He should direct a video game movie. &&I think NBA games are more likely than FIFA.&&I don’t really take him as a fifa guy.. &&#LifeGoals&&Meta&&Totally thought for a minute Reddit had now become obsessed with that guy.. I must've spent  30 mins last night watching his stuff thanks to then front page.&&It's called Metal Gear&&A Halloween: The Game ... asymmetrical just like F13th: The Game would be awesome.&&He got me. That fucking Carpenter baby boomed me.&&Same. Who knew so many people could be one person.&&We're ALL John Carpenter on this BLESSED thread!&&These are the two things I love most in my life and I'm 23, good to know it'll never change.&&Unfortunately there's already a sequel in the works with no connection to him.  The Rock is set to star if memory serves.&&John Carpenter for Space Jam 2&&I dunno, The Ward felt like it could've been directed by anyone and was a really mundane finale to a Carpenter marathon, especially as he still had that ""Carpenter feel"" in his previous feature film, Ghosts of Mars (it was bad, but it felt like his) and even his first Masters of Horror ep, Cigarette Burns. But The Ward was just a bland 2010s horror film that anyone could make. I kinda want one more, just so he can maybe have a better final film, but I feel like Carpenter as a young man said what he wanted to say as an artist and is enjoying old age.&&Which one did he do? I love those guys.&&Why are you trying to shove John Carpenter into a lootbox. He doesn't want to be in a lootbox.&&Pretty enviable music career you’ve got then!&&They already did that, it's called Logan&&I would love it!! Maybe it’s too much like the Thing for him? The thing in space. &&Lakers&&>dead space

*swoon*&&John Carpenter liking Bioshock and Borderlands 2 is awesome.&&>Bioshock, the Dead Space series

My man&&I feel like carpenter would enjoy a game like Prey 2017 or bloodborne &&That seems like some pretty legit stuff too. The usually celebrity answer is something like they dabbled in COD or Minecraft.&&I hope he played Prey if likes those!

So good he likes the more cinematic inspired video games too. Love it.&&The Last of Us... fuck yeah&&> The Last of Us

Sony, get him to direct the movie...&&Omg, having him direct and make the soundtrack to a bioshock or Dead Space movie would be amazing. I can hear the synth now.&&*The Last of Us*


Yep, this dudes living right &&Noticing a very big body horror theme with the last three.&&I’m happy that he likes The Last of Us. Honestly one of the best zombie survival games since the original Resident Evil series. &&I wish I could randomly play BL 2 with John Carpenter &&Dude has great taste. Original Sonic and Borderlands 2 are some of my most played games ever. Love the others as well of course. &&From 2017: Destiny 2.

I assume if he liked it, he came back for Forsaken when they fixed a lot of things.

https://kotaku.com/john-carpenter-is-dedicating-his-life-to-destiny-2-1819375700&&So probably destiny, natural progression from borderlands &&he should direct a video game&&He also talked about being addicted to Destiny a year or two ago &&EXPLOSIONS&&This man has amazing taste, Borderlands 2 is legendary &&Im sure he is talking about Sonic 06&&Ok the dude is officially not a casual. Fucking badass! If anyone questions why I still play games when I'm old as fuck, I'll have the John Carpenter card to play >:)&&Maybe he should make the Bioshock film.&&This man needs my babies... For gaming taste purposes... 😏&&In this day and age, with people like Post Malone and Lil Yachty starting their own twitch channels, imagine if John Carpenter decided to start streaming...&&I wish he made reviews&&Holy shit, this man has nothing but impeccable taste in everything he does.&&He has good tastes. Someone should introduce him to Nier: Automata as well.&&I love that he put out those GotY contributor lists.&&Well, we know Murdered: Soul Suspect sold at least one copy, and that was to John Carpenter apparently. &&His 2014 top pick was *very* surprising&&He also signed off on it being the official sequel to the movie as well. &&One of the best movie video games &&FUSE BOX SIMULATOR&&He also voiced a character in it too.&&Maybe he’s a Saw V fan&&I'd love for him to make a horror game as well as the soundtrack. &&He was involved in making of FEAR 3. No idea how much of his ideas was present in that game though. But you probably know how the game turned out. &&Because the demands of a film director and a game director are very different.&&He could direct the next NBA2K&&3&&He seems like more of a Barbie: Horse Rescue Adventure kind of guy.&&Bah! The guy that directed Prince of Darkness playing Hello Kitty!?!

Whats next? you gonna tell me the guy that made Mad Max directed Babe? 

Ridiculous!&&r/unexpectedsouthpark&&He did!&&you have if you've played 3 & 4 &&It does the stuff the other Far Cry's have done but it does it better.

Edit: Also, no radio towers. You uncover locations by finding maps and talking to npcs you run into or rescue.&&The story was great from what I played but it really doesn't do much to be different from 3/4. That was a big turn off for me, 4 had great gameplay however 5 played worse. Far Cry 2 still has the most involved environment compared to 5 where even fire doesn't do a lot.&&I don’t know why it would be shocking. Sports are are appreciated by roughly half of Americans. I wouldn’t have guessed basketball exactly, but I would put it at a 50% chance of any random person being a fan of one of the major sports. &&And ask him if Markelle’s jumpshot is fixed yet&&It's not a story the Celtics would have you hear.&&He's so good&&I hate every team that is not wearing our banana yellow Lakers jersey. &&I love that Carpenter uses the word ""oof"".&&My first ever shot glass was a Miami Heat one I got in 2013 specifically because I hated the LeBron Heat that much and wanted every shot to sting a little more

When he won a championship for Cleveland all negative energy dissipated and the dude became legendary. When he took that team of scrubs to the Finals last year single handedly, he gained my permanent respect.

Now im ecstatic to have him on the team. If you told me LeBron would be a Laker 5 years ago I would've laughed in your face and called him a flopping bum.&&> Lakers

Wow. Now I hate John Carpenter.&&>	I hate the Miami Heat. Hate them. And I hate them for a bunch of different reasons

Not something a Heat fan wants to hear from one of his favorite directors :(&&I can relate. I was denied video games as a kid and brought my very own console at 28. People think that I'm acting immature by playing games on weekends but I see it as making up for lost time.&&Dasitmayne&&Escape from Flatland staring Ice Cube.&&A whole Basketball team of Things playing against the Looney Tunes? Oh god. I never knew I wanted this.&&I would expect to see a scene with a decapitated foghorn leghorn head with spider legs growing of it making it's way down the court, and another player procede to say, ""you gotta be f****n kidding me...""&&I'm curious to see how it goes. Like, even if he's a year or two into retirement, if the Monstars *don't* take LeBron, I just don't think I can take the movie seriously. I can only suspend my disbelief so much.&&That's the most gruesome fetish I've ever heard of&&I mean there is the stuff *Dead Space* is based on: Most notably *Alien* and *Event Horizon*, the former being entirely(?) practical and the latter only having limited CGI. *Pandorum* was released a year after *Dead Space* and also has some strong similarities and was, I think also mostly practical.

I think a movie would still be interesting.

But I think *Dead Space* leans *heavily* on atmosphere and setting, as does much of Sci-Fi. And any movie adaptation would presumably, hopefully, do the same - and feel like an offbrand *Alien* movie. Because it kinda was an offbrand *Alien* game. Sure, the necromorphs aren't from the *Alien* franchise but slap ""Weyland-Yutani"" stickers on the equipement and ships and you ~~basically~~ have an *Alien* game.

I think the Markers were interesting, them causing people to become ""religious"" and descent into predetermined behavior with a mysterious but existing purpose - with *very tangible* real life consequences. Its very similiar to what *Event Horizon* did but seemingly less arbitrary and more holistic in its vision (possibly due to there being more room for explanation in a game). I think doubling down on that could be very interesting, not necessarily explaining more but what happened, how and why, being more of a focus.&&^oh&&Makes sense. Those games where awesome psychological thriller games. Wonder what would happen if he got on silent hill.....&&[deleted]&&Kojima would like a word&&I disagree, I believe a talented director could make an all time great story driven game, but they would obviously need a team with the talent to bring their vision to life. Something in the style of The Last of Us. Part of the reason I’m still bummed about Silent Hills is because del Toro was working on the story.&&\> I don't think much

fify&&Damn, Pixels 2 is a lot darker.&&Dead space. He’s perfect for that. &&After the ridiculous NBA Spike Lee story mode, I want to see Carpenter take a stab at a sports game singleplayer story.&&""Call me Snake""&&METAL GEAR?!&&Metal, Gear?? &&He said he wants to add Red Dead Redemption 2 as one of the games he'd like to play this summer. &&The last thing I thought this meme would crossover to&&Je Suis John Carpenter.&&Tech noir. Just voiceover&&Do I want to know what's in a John Carpenter loot box?&&They're both basically Children of Men (not an insult, love all 3).&&Watching Logan fight a Bloater would be something else.&&That’s the ONE thing he has going for him. He’s already done it. The Thing (1982) was a big inspiration for the Necromorphs so I don’t see why EA wouldn’t allow him to make a movie around it. Seeing as The Thing is held as a classic now. If anyone can make a video game horror movie it’s him. &&I mean, it does make sense. Dead Space is basically what happens if you put Event Horizon, The Thing, and Alien in a blender.&&That's how we convince him, get him to adapt Dead Space. &&Carpenter mentioned wanting to adapt Dead Space in [2013.](https://m.ca.ign.com/articles/2013/05/09/john-carpenter-wants-to-make-a-dead-space-film)&&This makes me happy, and I'm willing to bet the developers of Dead Space are Carpenter fans&&All I want is for John Carpenter to come back and direct a decent Dead Space movie. Is that really too much to ask?

edit: a letter&&If anyone could pull off a dead space movie it most definitely would be Carpenter. &&Is it time to replay ds1?!?&&Still salty we probs will never see a Dead Space remastered.&&Damn I miss the dead space series. I loved one and two. I wasn't a huge fan of 3 but I did enjoy the customization of the weapons allot.&&Yeah BL2 was one of my favourite games. It took the annoying aspects of 1, threw them out and refined the whole process. I played 2 even more than 1. It was one of the last games I was able to really play before my RSI came a callin and I’ll always remember it with a deep fondness. &&Looking good!&&He put out a tweet sometime last year praising prey and called it fantastic. So it seems he's already on top of it&&CAN YOU IMAGINE IF JOHN CARPENTER MADE A

MOVIES. LIKE HONESTLY. EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.&&He is also friends or a fan of the director of metal gear solid.

Just curious because I don’t see how they could add anything to story that wasn’t already there. A movie based on that game would be pretty redundant. Unless you mean you just want a movie that’s set in the same world but a different story or something. &&how about a movie/game like Last of Us? 

where they really emphasize  the story with the game. &&I liked that game a lot actually.

So two copies.&&Unity wasn't bad. It just wasn't great, and didn't come even close to surpassing AC4&&You won't believe what his 2014 top pick was!

Have we reached a point now where even Reddit comments are clickbait?&&That game needs a remaster. Fuck it was good. Have you played the board game?&&Directed the cutscenes&&Guillermo del Toro co-directed P.T. with Kojima. With Carpenter's input teaming up with an experienced team, I'm sure he could figure it out.&&The Reckoning&&I think the story and world are far more interesting than either of those, though. &&I own 2,, 3, 4 and Primal. Always do the same shit near the end as the tutorial, but with slightly better guns. at least 5 has actual co-op, not alternate missions. &&I could not get into 4 and abandoned it early on. 5 hooked me immediately and I played it non-stop till completion. I think 5 was a huge step up from 4, but that's just my opinion.&&I’m shocked cuz it’s not often you find a horror nerd that likes sports. At least in my 43 years on this Earth that’s what I’ve experienced.&&Fultz's jumpshot is probably what is inspiring him to consider directing horror again.  That, Kidd-Gilchrist's jumper and Joakim's tornado FT form are scary as hell.&&These new jerseys are so garbage this year. YEUGHHHHHHH, ugly. &&Fuck yes. I'm 32 and outside of work, God of War and Monster Hunter World are my life right now. &&And the things win&&I guess it's a fetish I just discovered I had &&I mean, he wasn't the main guy behind it, so... maybe we should give him an actual real chance...&&You mean F3AR?&&Right?&&If Kojima made a film I'd bet money it would not be recieved well at all.&&He loves westerns, give him Red Dead. &&John Carpenter on who’s scarier: Michael Myers or Wes Craven’s Freddy Kruger. “I don’t compare Myers with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of Lebron wearing a Myers mask and stabbing Paul Pierce. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Carpenter said.&&EVERY FUCKING THREAD&&That was him? Hah, holy shit I had no idea.&&There's probably someThing good in there&&John carpenter enjoying dead space is like genghis khan walking around modern China &&Do you need Alien in the mix if you already have The Thing?&&[deleted]&&I wonder if he played Prey&&If you put Alien in a blender you're going to need a new blender.&&Looks like dead space is going on my steam wishlist.&&Must be strange playing something that is derivative of your own works.&&I need a remaster on current Gen consoles soooooo bad. And a sequel. DS4 please.  &&I've always believed that The Thing and deadspace would be good together in the same canonical universe&&Throwback-“But will it blend?”&&I am so erect right now.&&This sounds like it could get me back into gaming just by itself&&Don’t forget 2001: A Space Odyssey&&https://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/05/09/john-carpenter-wants-to-make-a-dead-space-film&&Why can't we get a rich weirdo like Elon Musk to start bankrolling projects like this? &&Holy shit YES!

And it would be like coming full circle, considering the heavy influence of *The Thing* in the series.&&If something could kick the trend and make an amazing video game license movie, John Carpenter making Dead Space has got to be it. &&The first Dead Space is a classic&&If EA wasn't EA, we'd probably already have gotten DS HD trilogy on PS4/XB1 by now.&&2 is pretty far and beyond the best in the series thus far imo.&&What are the annoying aspects of 1? I personally think that’s my favortite game of all time. 

I really need to replay 2. A lot of that game I remember just driving across one of the ice worlds that has a bridge, which is not very positive. I clearly missed something &&Catch a riiide! &&Slow down!&&Came here to look for this. Prey was awesome.&&>Bloodborne

Practical effects pls daddy&&All of them in the style of Ghosts of Mars.&&I can't get more of a boner pls stop&&i can only get so erect pls no more&&That's literally the reason why MGS wasn't sued, cause they were bros lol.&&Carpenter and Kojima are friends? I'd love to see Kojima convince him to collaborate with him on a project. I wonder how that would turn out?&&Amazing! Thanks for that

Love that the devs got to see his praise too. Imagine your horror video game getting praised by the one of the legends of the genre.&&Awesome!

I really hope he tried SOMA too. It's got the heady sci-fi with abject horror. &&I mean, Children of Men and Logan show that a Last of Us movie could work. Granted it'd be derivative of both of those films *and* the game if it was a straight adaptation of the game, but still.&&That would be good too! I just said those because I think they fit his style a little better.&&I bought it as well but didn't progress past the opening part for unrelated reasons and never played again lol&&Unity was actually pretty amazing, and definitely one of my favorite games in the series. The bugs in the game were not as prevalent as many would have you believe. The biggest fault I have with the game is that the story is not very engaging.  It wasn't bad,  but I didn't care for that templar bird in the slightest.&&Wasn't dissing the game, just didn't picture him as an Assassins Creed type of guy, especially since The Evil Within was on there too

But yeah AC4 is still the best&&It’s definitely a favorite of me and my friends&&I think Vaas was the high point as far as character and enjoyed the island setting more personally. I felt 5 refined gameplay quite a bit &&I disagree. I liked 3 and 4 worlds and characters better. I really liked 3 and 4, but wasn't a big fan of 5.&&The story is better but it's basically the same game. I like the game a lot but it's true&&Usually people have more than one interest&&That font does not work well on the purple jerseys imo. I think it's the new shade of yellow they used. It doesn't have enough contrast from the white outline. I'm also not a fan of the black stripe.

The yellow jerseys just look terrible. Going straight bright yellow instead of gold looks awful.

I don't follow the NBA closely so I don't know when this change happened but God it's bad. &&I'm 40 and planing to buy a PS4 next month. My second and last console (first was the Odyssey) was a Nintendo Phantom. &&We are all the thing on this blessed day.&&How about Undead Nightmare? A John Carpenter directed, synth music driven cowboy zombie movie? Shit...&&I wouldnt even consider that a video game movie if it were made.&&|stabbing Paul Pierce|

Oof&&'Sure is a lot of people, it's time for another me'&&and contemplating leveling the whole thing for pasture land?&&Yeah, for the world-building/aesthetics side of things though, not the xeno itself. The Thing has necromorph design covered, but a lot of the environments in the DS games were very Alien-esque.&&You always need alien when penises or childbirth are involved.&&They're very different tones and settings&&These are fighting words to me&&The ship in headspace `USG Ishimura` has a similar feel to Alien's `Nostromo`&&I saw Event Horizon in theaters on acid.&&I’m sold on this. What’s the name?&&I have to ask; what did you think of Event Horizon? I had heard for years that it was underrated, tense, disturbing, and a plethora of other things any good horror film should be, but I just found it nonsensical, poorly performed (aside from Lawrence Fishburne), and frankly boring. The Hell scenes were probably less than a minute of the final picture, and were just flashy and confusing montages of mildly uncomfortable stuff. Its like Alien but with no tension, confusing stakes, and very little actual horror. 

I will say the aesthetic and design aspects of the film were good, if a bit on-the-nose, but that only disappoints me further because Paul W.S. Anderson decided to focus on making the film cool *looking* rather than actually *cool*.&&This has convinced me to watch event horizon &&That sounds like the worst piece of crap I’ll ever listen to start to finish. &&Homo Erectus you could say.&&Oh god I want this so bad&&Now that is now you combine work with leisure. My Man!&&I neeeed it nowwww. A studio needs to fund this! &&Only a 5 year old article. Any minute now it’ll come out right?&&Imagine having worked on Dead Space from the early days and reading this. It would be like Mick Jagger or Bob Dylan admitting they really like your band.&&Or even a rich weirdo like John Carpenter!!&&he would insist on writing his own cameo or someshit like that&&Well there is Neil Blomkamp. But between no studio wanting to give him work and his independent film attempt failing I don't see him being a likely choice.&&Technically, we have [Vin Diesel and Riddick](https://io9.gizmodo.com/vin-diesel-tells-us-why-riddick-is-one-big-game-of-dung-514236515) filling that particular hole.&&I'd rather Muks keep bankrolling space exploration and neural interfaces.&&A film inspired by a game inspired by a film. &&It may be the best horror trilogy in gaming. Sure the 3rd one kind of  falls off but what horror series (besides Resident Evil 3) doesn't get stale 3 games in?&&2 is my fav also, but I loved the Grinder and 0 G physics of PS. &&and it has the best DLC made for any game, ever.&&Snaps, Yes!&&Amygdala arm comes down from ceiling and grabs the hunter.

half the audience passes out.&&YEET!&&Either that or since it's pushing a Lovecraftian angle maybe it could go FULL cgi to get really trippy with the setting&&holy fuck can you imagine the weapons brought to life as props?&&Why are you the way that you are&&""Hey man can I copy your homework?""

""Sure thing bro""&&This warms my nerdy heart&&Yeah, Kojima is a massive film nerd which is why his games tend to feel like interactive movies. He and Guillermo del Toro are friends as well. Can you imagine a collaboration between Kojima, del Toro, and Carpenter? God, that might be enough to make up for the disappointment that Silent Hills turned out to be.&&Not exactly friends, but Carpenter mentioned in an interview that after the Lockout lawsuit, the producers also wanted to go after MGS, though he dissuaded them. Quote from him:

""[CanalPlus] wanted to also go after the video game Metal Gear Solid, which is kind of a rip-off of Escape From New York, too,"" Carpenter said, ""but I told them not to do that. I know the director of those games, and he’s a nice guy, or at least he’s nice to me.""&&Imagine Carpenter did the soundtrack for Death Stranding? There was already a tune at the end of the E3 trailer which seemed to flirt with the aura of John's musical work. &&Vaas was a great character, but they should really have expanded upon him instead of putting focus on Hoyt. Hell, it'd have been gold to see the chaos if you kill Hoyt FIRST, and then watch Vaas scramble to scoop up the influence left behind. Red vs Yellow with you stuck in the middle.&&Vaas was awesome, but they sort of did his character wrong by not having him be the main bad guy and just his lackey. Joseph Seed really unnerves me because he's a more ""real"" character to me, but Vaas was acted wonderfully.&&if they made FarCry 3, with the refinments in 4&5, it would be the best one by a mile imo&&Vaas, the character voiced so well the actor now has a staring role in an AMC show &&I can see that. 3 and 4 had more exotic worlds and that definitely has an appeal. I've personally always loved that ""southern gothic"" type setting, if that's even how you would refer to the game. I'm intrigued with Jonestown and things like True Detective and the game sort of touched on that atmosphere so it appealed to me personally. &&[deleted]&&I disliked 3 so much I didn't even play 4, but for some reason I decided to give 5 a shot and I really enjoyed it. I found the American rural setting was actually quite unique, more so than a big city or jungle.

In 3 I got really tired of driving around that big ass mountain they stuck in the middle of the map.&&Weirdly enough I liked the 4 story and characters better then 3. Havent played 5 yet though.&&Yeah, can't argue with that. However if you've never played Far Cry before and have a choice of the 3 I would say pick 5. However if you've played the previous titles it'll be very same-y.&&Yea and the overlap in the Venn diagram between horror nerds and sports is small. That’s what he’s saying.&&Especially successful rich people.&&It happened when NBA switched their jerseys to be made by Nike. Nike can’t make certain colors with the fabrics they use &&Damn. You're in for a treat. I got my ps4 a couple of months ago as a pc only gamer and I gotta say, its worth every penny. My personal recommendation: buy Horizon Zero dawn. God of War is pretty solid (so far) , but I still think Horizon is the best single player game on Ps4 at the moment. Also Last of Us remastered is something every gamer should experience at least once. Also Shadow of Colossus Remaster. Okay I'll stop now.

Edit: Oh! Bloodborne too! If you don't mind difficult and cryptic games. &&Speak for yourself&&""these pretzels are making me thirsty!""&&Wouldn’t “another me” just mean impregnating a third of them?&&'And a lot of them kinda look like me...""&&

&&[deleted]&&Early Alien comics had a plot similar to Dead Space with a cult revering the xenomorph as a kind of god. &&God damned CEC sent *families* to Aegis 7.&&That movie freaked me the fuck out sober how are you still alive lol &&I saw Jurassic Park in the theater with a friend who, unbeknownst to me, was on acid. He sprinted out of the theater the first time a dinosaur appeared and never came back. I found him in the bathroom after the movie, freaking out. We were 14, I didn't even know what acid was. He somehow talked me out of calling his parents or 911.&&Took my girlfriend, she was so mad when we walked out we had to immediately go back in so she could calm down and watch something nice. So then I was mad because I'm still buzzing from Event Horizon but having to watch Romy & Michelle's High School reunion.
Vicious circle that relationship. :)
&&My older brother snuck me in when I was ten. Had no idea what we were seeing besides the name and that is was a dark space movie. Still one of my favorite experiences ever in a theater. &&Had the same experience and it was amazing. I remember watching it for a second time at home relatively sober(stoned) and being less impressed but still loving it.&&I'll PM ya &&Me too. &&I remember being kind of disappointed that we didn't get to see more of Hell in the end. It didn't really feel like the movie had much pay-off. &&Yipee!

Hope you love it. &&It says 2013, so Ima guess it's not happening. I never got to play dead space, but I love the genres (Sci-fi & horror)and the man, so I'd be keen to see him make it.&&John Carpenter isn't really ""fuck you, I'll make my own"" rich, though. Like, he's rich enough to basically never have to work again if he doesn't want to as most of the last couple of decades show, but he's probably not got enough floating around to just go ""I feel like making a 30+ million dollar movie that might bomb spectacularly.""&&He's not that rich man.  &&The film would be full of advertisements with Boring Company flamethrowers, Tesla vehicles, Space X ships and stations, Tesla power reactors and the bad guy would be a british Pedo. &&What happened with him? How come no studio want to give him work? &&Which makes me sad to read because Chappie oozed 80s action sci-fi cheese vibes all over the place &&> neural interfaces

Be careful what you wish for...&&3 is great with co-op&&Fun fact, Code Veronica was supposed to be Resi 3 but Sony bought exclusivity rights to the main franchise so the spin-off game RE: Nemesis became the mainline entrant instead.

Also Silent Hill 1-3 were all solid so long as you can forgive how dated the first is.&&>It may be the best horror trilogy in gaming. 

Silent hill would like a word....

&&Fatal Frame 1-3 was solid set of games.&&**HERETIC**&&Also the PS characters were broken as fuck but holy are they fun to play. I wish i could play BL2 with Athena somehow...&&Every game is made better with the addition of a buttslam move.&&Tiny Tina's was an absolute journey. One of those things I wish I could experience playing for the first time again.&&All the nightmares came today and it looks like they're here to stay&&The [saw cleaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Xp0bZP0Us) has already been done. (Skip to 9:24 for completed product.)&&Probably because he's a realist who knows that Carpenter isn't the director he was 20 years ago, and that almost all video game adaptations are rife with dev/studio interference&&Well, Silent Hills was Del Toro, Kojima, and Junji fucking Ito. Nothing will make up for that. &&I'd give a lot of money to see 3 of the greatest creative minds in the world get together and make a horror movie. Del Toro would make sure there were fantastic practical effects, Carpenter would create an awesome soundtrack, and Kojima would make it all weird as hell. &&Holy shit the monsters, I can see them, can you imagine how trippy that game would be? How terrifying? Fuck, I need this. &&> Can you imagine a collaboration between Kojima, del Toro, and Carpenter?

[I don't think it's safe for me to do so](https://i.imgur.com/6gRCnAr.gif)&&I liked the Silent Hill movie.

As a side note, I went to Centralia, PA a couple weekends ago. That's where the inspiration for Silent Hill came from. And I was very disappointed. No one flaming infant or Pyramidhead anywhere.&&Agreed. Vaas will go down as one of greatest FPS's boss enemies of all time. Hoyt? I forgot about that guy less than a year. He's not bad, but Vaas, and even Vaas's sister, out did him. They really blew it making Hoyt the final bad guy.&&Joseph Seed is a character that can and does exist, his depiction was great in that regard.  The other Seeds were more ""movie"", in that they were outlandish, but Joseph was just the classic David Koresh type.&&Vaas was a fucking moron. He couldn't even execute a captured prisoner and he tried like three fucking times.&&Vaas is the only thing that I can still remember about that game.&&Did you like the new Resident Evil, then?

I loved the aesthetic of True Detective season 1. I even downloaded the soundtrack. I wish I could watch it again for the first time.&&Man, I actually loved the endings. I knew they'd be **bad**, not because someone spoiled it but because it's a Far Cry game, and c'mon. The main ending was such an absurd, intense rush from start to finish that I really felt it wrapped up the game much more satisfyingly than previous isntallations. &&Yeah I know that the endings for Far Cry are typically unsavory but both of 5's endings were just annoying. Either way, everything you did was worthless. &&It felt drastically different to me from 3 and 4, but in my opinion 4 could've been a DLC for 3, it was so similar.&&The overlap between Horror and Browns fans  is pretty big though. &&I'm a horror nerd and huge sports fan. But now that I think about it, most of my friends are not that into horror movies, but almost all are sports fans. Interesting. &&I'm still perplexed because I see no reason why the two should attract different types of people&&Liking horror is pretty mainstream.... maybe it depends on the generation or something but most people I know enjoy horror movies, and at least half of them are also into sports. 

Maybe if you said something like Anime or something, but horror isn't that underground or niche that fans of it wouldn't enjoy sports. &&Fantasy baseball has a surprising overlap for a lot of other ""nerdy"" things. But a quick trip to any major sports subreddit you'll find that there's a huge overlap with anime, card games, table top games etc. Haven't seen the horror nerd overlap as much though, now that I think about it.&&I love horror films and the four major North American professional sports.

Why is this such a big deal?&&Man how does Nike keep getting these deals? They've made some pretty horrific NFL uniforms with their whole color rush gimmick.

Blomkamp wa slated to direct and had a script, but when Ridley Scott expressed interest they (fox) jumped ship. Even if Scott's film would be a flop (it was) name recognition alone and continuing his storyline would be the better bet financially

He tried starting an independent studio, but had a rather weird business model that was uneccasirly complicated and didn't really have a clear direction. &&To elaborate on the comment below yours; Fox was actually interested in NB's Aliens sequel initially because  of Sigourney Weaver and his involvement. With the sway Ridley had he jumped onto produce, but then later decided he wanted to make Aliens Covenant first, despite the numerous changes over the years while it was sitting around in the fridge. Ridley had the power so Blom's Aliens was put onto the back burner, not to confuse the timelines. While work was going on with AC(Pre, shooting,and post) Neil heard less and less from Ridley, or about the project. Fox's relationship was with Ridley, so interest became more about the third Prometheus film and talks of a weird prequel film with Ripley(iirc). Thus Ridley throwing Neil right under the bus despite both Weaver and Michael Biehn being 100% behind Neil's vision. Sad really.

Then AC came out and everything went out the door...&&If all you wanted was an updated, modern day version of short circuit (which I did), it was fantastic. &&Literally No one on earth could stop this tech from coming, unless we see Armageddon/apocalyptic events&&I have to agree with this. Sadly the story in 3 only shines when you have people playing as both characters.

They took time with 5.&&But the overlap between Browns fans and sports fans is nonexistent.  &&Could be worse. Could be Steelers fans.

Dead Space is now five years out since their last game, which sold far less than what they wanted it to, and John Carpenter hasn't made a critically (to say nothing of commercially) successful movie since In The Mouth of Madness.

I want him to make another great movie, but you can kind of tell that at a certain point he was just like ""fuck it, I just wanna go make music."" And more power to him, his music is still amazing.&&> But let’s be real. You put Tom Hardy and Venom on a poster.

How'd you feel about the ending though, with the whole brain transfer shit? &&I still don't understand the hate for the movie. It is flawed, but not enough to earn the hate it gets, in my opinion. I was initially taken out of the movie because of Die Antwoord, but by the end I had warmed up to them. &&I'm also partial to the graphics themselves but I recall that game having some weird rendering issues that might bother some people. It has been a couple years though, and probably neigh a decade since I played it on original hardware.&&I do remember and still think it’s a notable classic.

Why aren’t horror movies that feature gratuitous amounts of nudity and sex called ‘Hornos’???

Which then led to google.

Which then led to the discovery that there is in fact a horror movie called Horno.

Kim Possible. &&She said it best:

>""Bond is male,” [Barbara Broccoli] said. “He’s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he’ll probably stay as a male. And that’s fine. We don’t have to turn male characters into women. Let’s just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.”&&#Perfect Dark&&Why does it have to be tied to James Bond? Just go make a badass female spy movie. Boom. Cool. I'll watch.&&Stop fucking around with other properties and create original content like Atomic Blonde and Bridesmaids. They weren't perfect but they were original concepts. They're out there, you just have to invest in them. &&Well, of course not. Bond is a strictly male fantasy character; Having him be a woman would miss the point. Masculinity is at his core.

On top of that, why not give other female spies a try? Lorraine Broughton from *Atomic Blonde* is the perfect gendered counterpart to the super spy.&&Maintaining the traditional identity of a character doesn't mean all other identities are shit.  Alien wouldn't be the same with a male Ripley.&&Nor should there ever be one. *Just make a new fucking character.*&&Why not create a female secret agente thats... NOT James bond


How about that?&&If it wasn’t James Bond but instead like a spin-off and another double o agent I’d be interested.&&[deleted]&&Make an M prequel set way back in like the 70's or something, starring Emily Blunt or maybe Natalie Portman. I'd watch that.&&I'd watch a spin-off about that ass-kicking woman spy from the last Mission Impossible.

Same with Furiosa. You don't have to make her Mad Maxine; just give her a spin-off.&&[deleted]&&Good. We don't need every movie to have a female rehash. &&Every male character doesn’t need to be turned into a female. Make your own great female character.&&why is this even a discussion?&&I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Stop gender/race bending characters and give those folks NEW characters.  Just because you can't think of a new plot/theme doesn't mean you need to go dive into an older one and try to change it all.  Blah.&&James bond is one person, not many.  With the doctor it makes sense because he/she regenerates into a new person, but James Bond... is James Bond.  I don’t see how anyone thought this made sense.  If you want a female lead than make a new franchise or make a new character and have James Bond as a secondary or something, but how the fuck is James Bond supposed to be a woman.  Unless of course its like an alternate universe where it was always female James Bond, like, spidergwen, but still - why? If it’s because most of the well known characters in movies are men, then *make a new female character, either for her own franchise or to sort of “take over” in James Bond’s place*.  I don’t know, I just think this whole trend is kinda stupid. &&A male Charlies's Angel group will also not work, this is no sexism, just not everything works with both male and female. &&Frankly, I find the recent “hey, let’s do the same film but with an all-female cast instead of all-male” trend patronising and counter-productive to the feminist movement.&&Good. I'm all for female badasses but not at the expense of a well established franchise. Making a female Bond would go against what Bond is: a male fantasy. If you want to create a female version of Bond, a completely new character is a much better path. A character that can stand on her own and give proper respect to what a female badass can be. &&If we have a Moneypenny movie that would be kick-ass, the actor they have is fantastic and I would watch a full film with her as a star.  Just hire Naomie Harris for a spy thriller and everyone can be happy. 
&&I agree.  Creating female characters to replace male characters has to stop.  James Bond is a work of fiction from a WW2 handler.  The real WW2 era female spies are a much better story.  E.g.:

https://listverse.com/2013/09/05/10-women-spies-who-brought-down-the-third-reich/

Just make a movie about these people.  They are real and awesome.&&Atomic Blonde exists. &&Let's be real here, a female Bond would take this franchise right to the gutter.&&For the last time, james bond doesn't need to be made progressive, he is by nature a sexist character and you would either change the character so it's no longer bond or you would just make him female and then you would have a still sexist but female bond. Idk which is a worse idea for a movie. As a woman I don't want to see a female character act the way bond does, what's the point of that?

What people really want is a cool and female spy character, but I think specifically a character that can be used in a franchise, that can become a cultural icon like Bond. But that's difficult, and though some film makers have tried they will just have to keep trying.&&Holy fuck. How many dumb people are there? Bond is a man. Write a female character that’s a similar spy type. Stop changing existing characters, get creative and write new ones. Fuck. &&Even if you wanted to make a ""female Bond film"", it doesn't specifically have to be James Bond.  I bet you could get a lot of hype with a movie titled *008* about a female spy/assassin in the same universe and service as James Bond.  Then you could even use the current M and Q, or have Daniel Craig/current Bond do a cameo.&&Wait until they decide to do a gay Bond. Riots in the street. &&Like Artemis says in a recent episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, casting women in something and doing the exact same thing the guys did is a waste of time. 

“if we’re doing the same thing, why do it at all?”

James Bond is a guy, just like Hermione Granger is a girl, to borrow a character from another beloved franchise.

They've tried making spy movies with women leads, and while some of them are fine movies, slapping the name ""Bond"" on it isn't going to suddenly make it anything more than a novelty.


There's also the whole disservice to the fact that it was a character created by someone. Have some respect for what that character was meant to be. OR are we going to just start going back and finding characters in franchises created by dead authors and change their sex for the shit of it? Frodo can be a girl now! Let's make Treebeard a lady ent! Jack Ryan could just be Jill Ryan!

It's silly.&&Never say never again.&&Let's start doing male versions of famous female movies&&Exactly. That would like making Annie black or ghostbusters female or oceans crew female. You just wouldn’t do it. Oh...wait. 

Can’t wait to see a white guy play as blade. &&Sort by controversial 


Edit: i actually did it and regret every moment of it&&Imagine a male lara croft, lars croft, fuck that bullshit&&I'am always mad when those morons from Hollywood are trying to ride the game of some established franchise and turn it into all female movies. Like Ghostbusters,  Ocean 8, Terminator, Last Jedi itp.

And when the movie fail either financially or like Last Jedi - with the fans. They use mythical patriarchy as excuse. It's like get out of jail free card for them. Because if that would be stand alone movie that failed then they cannot blame others. Just themselves.

And I'm pissed even more because WHEN those movie failed they act like that mythical patriarchy took over Hollywood and there are no great series with female leads. So they had to do it.

It's like they pretend that Aliens, Kill Bill, Wonder Woman and other great movies or even entire series never happened.

What is their latest plan? Take action heavy franchise like Terminator, put ""all wymen"" spin on it. But instead hiring great actress that can actually carry action movies - they hire Grammy for nostalgia.
This is how Ocean 8 failed. Those actresses for most part were too old and too slow to carry movie like that.&&Why not just make a new movie about a spy who is a woman?


And she isn't related to any past franchise at all.


And her being a woman isn't the point of the movie.


And she's not a slightly clutzy, underecognized spy trying to have it all.


And there's no love story. At most, she sleeps with some dangerous guy who falls for her, then betrays his darker instincts due to his infatuation with her.

And fuck it, cast her as a Latina woman that *doesn't* die in the second act, or have a US military background. &&How about a new IP with new characters and new stories? 

Or an old one everyone's walked away from... (Still dreaming for more Cate Archer / No One Lives Forever.)&&[deleted]&&Surely there are other 0XX agents that can be female? &&Obviously not **James** Bond is a man and was in the books, just like Harry Potter.

Edit: highest karma comment is about a character movie that i have been wanting for years... damn, ya'll make me proud.&&because thats what hollywood does now. they take popular ""male movies"" and gender swap them to show us what for.&&Because it’s a lot riskier. Not that people haven’t tried.

For the people who pay for James Bond to happen, they want to make money. That’s their goal. The more a movie costs the riskier the investment so the safer everything has to be, story, characters, merch, sponsors/partnerships, cast, crew, poster, writer, etc. in order to ensure that those millions of dollars turn a profit.

People are more willing to spend money on something familiar, lots of people like James Bond. A lot of people don’t but will go see the New James Bond just based on the hype or it’s something to do, or a friend asked. Etc.

There are lots of indie films being made by and featuring women, they’re just not as publicized nor widely released. Because making a movie is expensive and so is getting the word out.&&Not exactly a Spy movie, but Ghost in the Shell (1995, Innocence, Arise and ""the new movie"")^1 is close enough. And the Major feels more authentic and fleshed out^(no pun intended) than many other female protagonists I've seen.

End of story there; make a new story and Ill be for it. &&I'm pretty sure Atomic Blonde is getting a sequel, at least.&&*Atomic Blonde* is based on *The Coldest City*, a graphic novel.&&Thiiiiis. Marvel released a statement some years ago saying no one was buying the girl super heroes and everyone resoundly snapped back with “stop making all of our existing super heroes women suddenly and give us a new character with a unique personality.”&&James is a silly name for a girl anyway.&&You think female Bond and you think BRIDESMAIDS?&&They could also write in a female partner for him. Bond girls aren't always useless anyway, so I don't think people would even bat an eye if they did that. As long as they don't replace him, I don't see anyone caring. At least not anyone who matters.&&It's not about needing a popular IP. It's about taking a loved male character and pissing on it to show ownership.&&Was bridesmaids original? I thought of it as an almost carbon copy of the hangover&&Produce an original movie without any franchise backing? *shudders*&&[Rosamund Pike, a former bond girl, made the same argument](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/rosamund-pike-james-bond-female-1201952170/)

> “I’d just say write a new story,” Pike says. “James Bond is a character that Ian Fleming created. Of course the brand has become bigger and whatever, but take one of the Bond Girls and give her her own story. I think the character of James Bond is a man. He is really.

> “To have such a character in a completely independent series, why should a woman get sort of sloppy seconds?” Pike asks. “Why should she have once been a man and now it has to be played by a woman? Why not make a kick-ass female agent in her own right?”

Rachel Weisz said something similar too.&&I thought a Moneypenny movie could have been cool, but they basically nixed her character development after Skyfall.  

And she wouldn't need to be a female bond, she could just be Moneypenny.&&I like your style :) Atomic Blonde was badass.&&I dug Atomic Blonde. And even though it isn’t really the badass super-spy movie, I watched Red Sparrow the other night and really enjoyed it actually. &&> On top of that, why not give other female spies a try?

Long Kiss Goodnight was a fantastic spy action movie with a very relatable female lead. It's too bad nobody bought tickets for it... 


Maybe they could do a remake with Scarlett Johansson?&&I mean, No One Lives Forever exists, you can start with that.&&There are tons of femme fatales that are never followed up on. Salt, hanna, atomic blonde, charlie’s angels, femme nikita, alias, black widow, lara croft, just to name a handful. Where are these characters and series now? 

It’s not the characters’ fault that people write shit movies for them. The properties exist.&&atomic blonde was really good. i hate how society just wants to steal every brand, just make something new that is great in it's own merits.&&To be very fair, they didn’t write the role with a gender in mind. Weaver was just the best audition. &&Especially when the gender dynamic is such an essential part of the character. A hugely discussed analogous undertone in the Alien films was that Ripley represented a strong feminine presence, fighting rape, especially evidenced by the Alien’s phallic imagery.

Edit: Apparently my comment has offended many brosefs out there. Chill out ragers, this subtext was first mentioned by the actual screenwriters of the film because they wanted to “make the men in the audience cross their legs” as the Alien was originally supposed to rape and impregnate a male lead but the casting of Weaver changed that.&&Yea but when they rebooted Battlestar Galactica, they made Starbuck a woman and it made the character a more interesting likeable character.&&I, for one, would like a totally spies live action reboot&&Jamie Band, played by Amy Schumer&&True enough, I know Bond always works solo but having another, female 00 weaved into a storyline would be cool.  Then if the reaction to her is good, she gets a solo movie, because this is the age of the cinematic universe.&&In the book ""Devil May Care"" (not Fleming, but still canon) Bond works with a female 00 agent. I'd definitely rather see that... I *hate* the idea of taking a male character and making him female... Its just not who he is and would completely destroy the character.&&Long Kiss Goodnight &&M was a man until the 90's&&Emily Blunt grows up to become Ralph Finnes &&> starring Emily Blunt

I'm in.&&idk Mad Max was interesting because pretty much the whole movie wasn't his story. I almost felt more connected to furiosa since Max had to change as a character to finally help her get revenge and free the people. Max just kinda wanted to go home the whole time, and I feel like that's what a lot of us would have wanted to do.&&Theres not going to be a spin off , the out line is max coming back after ten years , and furiosa is corrupted by power taking over as dictator, and max kills her &&Unfortunately, WB fucked Miller over, so he's not inclined to make another Mad Max. Or, well, a Mad Max spinoff.&&[deleted]&&Isn't that just Indiana Jones?&&Yup. I'm sick of movies being remade now but with a female cast. &&How offensive! It's 2018 you know!&&Yeah it's just lazy writing and I'm very surprised it's not considered a form of tokenism.&&Well A-Team was a fun ride, not exactly the same thing and done a bit differently. &&[deleted]&&Seems like people are forgetting women can be their own characters. Ghost busters & oceans 8 would have been more successful if they werent spiteful remakes... imo&&exactly, why not just do this? It'd have the exact same effect without changing your flagship character beyond recognition&&I think a conceivable first step here would be to have him flirt with a gay man for something the way he does to women all the time, and subtly suggest the question *is Bond bi or was he just taking advantage of someone for selfish reasons?* but leave it unanswered.&&Jim Possible&&its not that it couldnt work, ala atomic blonde, but it just wouldnt be James Bond 007.&&Wait what?!&&> ~~when~~ since

ftfy&&It’s because leaving the title like that creates more raaaaaaage&&I read through probably 2/3rds of it and agree with her opinion for never having a female James Bond. If they ever decide to have a female agent equivalent version of Bond well there are other double O designations they can use. The list of other double O agents in the Bond universe is quite extensive with many having little to no details given to them. So I'd be perfectly fine if they had a female agent with another double O designation but just not bond's OO7 designation or his name. Basically make a spinoff series that has nothing to do with James Bond.&&I don't think the title contradicts that point. That said, it could be that I see it that way because I filled in the blanks in my mind. Nobody is going to come out and say that women can't handle a role like James Bond, so the producer was most likely talking about James Bond being a male character with no gender swap planned.&&Broccoli is actually called broccoli because of their family name.

Her dad was Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli and this is from his [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_R._Broccoli):

""Albert's ancestors originally had the surname of broccolo and were some of the first people to produce and sell what we now call broccoli during the 17th century in Italy. The family's surname is what inspired the current name of broccoli, although it was originally called albero-cavolo, which means tree cabbage in Italian.""&&Oh, it's actually Barclay&&> I'm more stuck on someone having a last name of broccoli.

If you translate one of the last names in my family tree when translated means ""bean farmer."" I am going to guess at one point her family grew Broccoli. If you want to see some names translate some Dutch last names: Naaktgeboren(born naked), Poepjes(Small Poops), Zonderkop(Without Head), Niemandsvriend (Nobody’s friend), Knas(Cuddle), etc. French occupation forced people who didn't have last names to have them so many didn't have them till 1795 to 1813.&&Any headline that is a question is shit. Bonus fun fact! Reporters don't write the headlines of their own stories and often cringe at whatever has been slapped up there by an overworked editor just skimming the story. &&I wonder how many people clicked this without knowing the executive producer of Bond series is female. &&> that makes it sound like she's against diversity

it really doesnt make it sound like that, only for people who look for something to be outraged by &&I think people already understand that there should be more character diversity in films. You don't need someone to talk about it every 5 minutes. We already know. The headline just states what the bond fans actually care about. I almost guarantee if they made bond female then the series would tank because the character was never made or meant to be female. This whole trend of gender swapping characters really just needs to stop. I mean really? Is that the best idea a creator can come up with? I mean isn't It their job to be creative? I'd rather see new movies and characters any day over a movie about a gender swapped character that I used to love. I feel like gender swapping characters will do nothing but destroy the franchise 9 times out of 10.&&Well, M *was* an entirely new character, who happened to be female. It's just that every boss of MI6 is called 'M' in the movies.

It would be like if a new female character (who is not Bond) became 007. Different character, same codename.&&The sad part is, we already have that, kinda. Except it's closer to Bourne than it is to Bond.

I'm talking about Salt. The movie was decent, wasn't reviewed too terribly, left a lot of room for sequels and I'm a bit salty there aren't any.&&If it followed the datadine story I'd watch the shit out of it.&&This would be amazing. Those games were perfect&&Atomic Blonde was a great movie in general. That's honestly what the action genre should strive to be when it comes to gender equality. It didn't feel like her sex played a role in much of the plot at all, but it was still as good (better, usually) than a lot of spy movies.&&Salt was pretty solid IMO.&&Hanna is getting a full TV series now, and I'm excited. &&Salt needs a sequel.&&Yeah, how come you need to gender swap a male character when you have plenty of interesting and capable women who already exist. Seems a little demeaning that your leading lady had to ride to fame as a male first.&&Hell yeah. This is a thousand times better concept because it expands on the existing lore and focuses on a character that doesn't have to be forcefully changed to fit the mould.

..Is it wrong to say ""James Bond lore""?&&Or Jynx! I mean she was basically a black, American, female, hot, Jame Bond anyway, she's literally the *perfect* character to base a new series on&&The always sunny episode about this is so damn funny. &&Judi Dench was amazing as M. Gender swaps can work if done well. &&Jokes on them. Neither Ghostbusters nor Oceans 8 lived up to the hype.&&Can't wait for the Predator reboot. I don't have time to bleed becomes much more disturbing&&It's not Hollywood it's because audiences are adverse to trying anything new and studios know its a safer bet to reboot an old franchise or make a sequel/prequel.&&Oceans 8 😪&&Many of us do&&[Emily Blunt would make a badass female spy.](https://youtu.be/GNoQdKDZwHM?t=5)&&Funny thing is, he's public domain now literary-wise. Jane Bond can legally exist the same way Joan Watson can. &&That's good news. It was a good flick&&Damnit I thought it might have been based on something but didn't know for sure. Adaptations are good though. &&I was just expecting it to be a female John Wick but it was different. Actually had a story and not just over the top action. &&I don't think marvel or dc comics have created a superhero in the last 20 years that's very popular. I don't mean women, just at all. Maybe even the past 30 years. The closest is harley quinn which was made by a tv show, then what's after that? So the choice is either A) Don't have any popular female characters, or B) switch some of their existing characters and hope they get away with it or C) resurrect old characters and hope people care. 

[Look at this list](http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2018/2018-01.html).

Batman, x-men, TMNT, batman, x-men, Harley Quinn, Star Wars, batman. 

So they're trying all 3. Gwenpool/The Wasp/etc are their most popular new ones, which are basically spinoffs or side characters for stuff they're already doing. But they're definitely looking at the possibility that they're not going to have many major female characters, which makes it harder for them to appeal to wide audiences. So they're trying everything.

Edit: A lot of people are discussing what's popular. To me, if I ranked a list of superheroes by name recognition, you should be reasonably high. Deadpool is a good example from from 27 years ago, definitely somewhat popular before the films and very well known now. But people like miles morales, I would say are well liked and sell a series, but aren't at the same tier.&&From a business perspective, being able to simultaneously accomplish strong virtue signaling as well as saying that a mistake wasn't actually your fault *as well* as saying you don't have to change your ways is an absolute dream come true.&&I mean arent they generally characters with unique personalities and they just have the powers of the original hero or is it that they are just drawing them as females, changing the name, and keeping everything else the same? I mean is male thor the same character as female thor or do they just have the thor powers? &&Take any sort of risk?  *runs away*&&Yeah, why do that when you can just use a well known series and shove a female character on their place? It's half the work and double the profit.    

Ghostbusters? Ghostbusters *with women*!   

*Oceans* heist movies? Oceans *with women*!    

James Bond? James Bond *as a woman*!   

See how easy this is? &&Nice try at getting your own spy movie, miss Pike&&Weren't they trying to do that with Halle Berry's Jinx?&&This is my main problem with racebending, genderbending, what have you.  It's insulting.

You take Superman.  People want a black Superman.  Why?  Make a movie about a black superhero.  Make a new black superhero.  Why do you want to co-opt a guy that's white already?  That's like saying, 'We don't really feel a black man can hold his own, we need to have that brand recognition behind it.'  It's people basically asking to have a white savior.  It's stupid.&&Doesn't really have to be a post-Skyfall movie.

Could be a pre-Skyfall movie.&&Great soundtrack. I fell into a Falco hole for weeks after I saw it.&&After I saw the first poster, I was disappointed it wasn't a Debbie Harry biopic.

&&Long Kiss Goodnight is legit one of my all time favorite movies. Charlie Baltimore was a bad ass character and I wish we could’ve gotten at least one more movie out of Geena Davis. My favorite Shane Black move too! &&> Long Kiss Goodnight 

Hell yeah. I watched that movie with no information about it before hand and man was it fun. I absolutely loved it. Think imma watch it again &&Long Kiss Goodnight was the first ever DVD I bought.

Edit* glad it's seems to be a popular opinion. &&> they didn’t write the role with a gender in mind

This is how you write the best female characters, IMO.&&Yeah.  The way I originally heard it, the writers pretty much got out a white board and wrote every scary idea they could think of. 

The dark? Insects. Isolation.  Being raped.  Being eaten alive.  Ok how can we use all thise elements in one movie?&&[deleted]&&With Starbuck, it wasnt that they made the character more interesting or likeable, its that they made the character three dimensional.

He doesn't though.

*Tomorrow Never Dies* gets a lot of flack (like most Brosnan Bond movies that weren't *Goldeneye*), but he teamed up with a Chinese agent (who happened to be a woman, Michelle Yeoh) for at least part of that movie. And again with an NSA agent (Halle Berry) in *Die Another Day*.&&This. I'm female, but Bond is a guy. Plain and simple. It'd be like making Indiana Jones a girl, it just doesn't work. Same for flipping a character like Ellen Ripley, it just doesn't work.&&Exactly, before the character played by Judi Dench became M, she could have been an MI-6 operative.&&I love the Bond is a codename theory, but there is little support for it. There is a lot of support for the M is a title theory though. 

At one point Daniel Craig's Bond says ""your predecessor kept a bottle of *fancy drink* in that cabinet"" to Judi Dench's M. She must have been an MI6 agent before being promoted to administrative duties. No reason we couldn't see her story some day.&&Source? I'm interested in reading more&&That's a funny joke, but they've really toned down the sexuality of Lara since the reboot games started.&&A female Indiana Jones is Lara Croft. A male Lara Croft is Nathan Drake. &&touché...&&But that's not what that character was. She was never supposed to be a spy. This new re-imagining that happened with those side characters in Skyfall took an odd turn where one wasn't needed.

There is such a thing as a tertiary character that's supposed to be the polar opposite of the lead. She's from the real world, he's the spy with a license to kill. She was always supposed to be one that doesn't take his shite, even when he walks in to the agency after some big caper and strutting his stuff, her character was supposed to be the representation of reality (literally) smacking him in the face. She wouldn't fall for his flirtatiousness that might have worked on women while undercover, she knew him more personally. His charms wouldn't work on her, yet she'd flirt back b/c they had that playful banter between each other.

It's like certain execs and folks forgot what staying true to a character is all about. If the series needed a woman spy, they can introduce a new 006 or 008 that's a completely new female character.&&Ghostbusters should have embraced the original movies and continued on rather than trying to rewrite them. It should have been a franchise.

The world is a very big place. Presumably there are ghosts everywhere. One old firehouse in New York City isn't enough, not even for New York City.

The original ghostbusters would be old and retired from active duty now. They'd instead be the board of directors of the company. They'd license out ghostbusting franchises all across the world.

This would have opened up infinite sequel possibilities. Ghostbusters set in Paris or Rome? Those catacombs under the city sure could get busy. There could be ghostly Roman legions and ghostly barbarian hordes. Netflix already made Ghostbusters: Stalingrad, with the movie called Specter. Ghosts in a war torn hellhole city that is all burned out ruins and corpses. A city under siege can have a lot of restless undead.

Various franchise locations also allows the introduction of new characters and new actors/actresses very easily. The original guys are too old for this shit. They're sitting in a fancy boardroom with cigars. The newly hired younger people do the gruntwork of lugging a proton pack up 80 flights of stairs.

See, that takes the old, combines it with the new, and does so in an open ended way.&&He kinda does that in Skyfall tho, but it's implied it's for the latter reasons&&or... he could fuck the villain to death&&Here’s the twist. We show it. Full on penetration.&&Id rather see something more along the lines of The Americans. 

In the show Philip and other S spies had to train themselves to screw old men, old women, ugly people, all so they could do it if the mission needed it.

What I mean is, you don't see 140lb Charleize Theron effortlessly taking down 220+ lb dudes like weight and physics mean nothing. When she fights people, it isn't black widow destroying everyone without breaking a sweat. It shows her getting injured, almost losing, being battered and bruised and fucked up by dudes three times her size like in real life. She has to use heels and technique and dirty fighting to get out of the situations *like in real life*. If some 250+ lb solid muscle dude chokes me (170 lbs) from behind, I'm not going to flip over him acrobatically and give him one kick and he goes flying 50 feet. I'm going to struggle and gasp, and flail and try to gouge out an eye, and stomp feet and try to hit his groin, or elbow or head butt repeatedly until he loosens his grip and then I would take off my steel toed boot and slam it against his head repeatedly.



In sum, atomic blonde was great because it felt *real*. She really struggled, she was injured and beat down, but her will, determination, grit, technique, perseverance and will to live (aka fight to survive, not fight for the movies) made it bad ass.


This article says it better than me: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atomic-blonde-doesnt-pretend-women-fight-like-men-and-the-result-is-awesome_us_597b3c67e4b02a8434b5df58&&I would say sex very much played a role.

Maybe not the last 20 years, because X-23 (2003) and the new Guardians of the Galaxy team (2008), to the extent that they are new characters, are the only examples I know off. But the Guardians really show that success can be found in reinventing and doing interesting stuff with characters that no one outside of nerddom has heard of.  

>Maybe even the past 30 years.

That’s not true at all.  Venom (1988) and Deadpool (1991) are A-listers who have had solo films this year.  Gambit (1990) is huge among X-Men fans, and he’s been set as the lead in a solo film played by Channing Tatum.  War Machine (1992), Bishop (1991), and Cable (1992), while not exactly A-listers among non-comics fans, have played key roles in the biggest superhero movies of this decade.  

And, while they’re not Marvel or DC characters, I feel like I should note that Spawn (1992) and Hellboy (1993) are huge franchises. 
&&> Gwenpool/The Wasp/etc are their most popular new ones

You spelled Ms. Marvel wrong.&&Jessica Jones.  &&X-23 was created in the late 90s/early 00s for X-Men Evolution and she’s a fan favorite. You’d probably recognize her in Logan.

> Halle Berry’s “Jinx” Spin-Off

> The concept of a female-driven spin-off series originated in 1997 with the Bond thriller “Tomorrow Never Dies.” Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh, whose charisma and fighting skills made her a superstar on the Hong Kong action film circuit, starred as Wai Lin, a master spy in China’s elite Secret Service. The character proved so popular that MGM briefly considered developing a solo film around her. When that didn’t pan out, producers decided to bring her back for the 2002 Bond film “Die Another Day.” Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts prevented Yeoh’s return.

> Word of a spin-off series involving Halle Berry’s character Jinx from “Die Another Day” began circulating while the film was still in theaters. Rumors hinted at a planned winter release in 2004.

> “Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired to write the script and, though it was never officially announced, Stephen Frears was on board to direct,” said Chris Wright. “But in late October of the following year, MGM pulled the plug.”

> Reasons for its cancellation remain unclear.

> When news first broke, a spokesperson for Eon producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson claimed that “creative differences” were involved. But Variety reported that MGM’s decision to nix the film took the Eon team by surprise. In any event, no apparent effort was made to set the project up at another studio.

> Perhaps Jinx simply wasn’t dynamic enough to build a new franchise around? The character, a skilled NSA operative with a mean left hook, remains more memorable for her stylish orange bikini and Ursula Andress-like entrance than for her originality or depth.

> “Not a lot is known about the script itself,” said Tom Sears. “But Purvis and Wade have suggested that their idea was to involve Jinx in a story that would’ve been a lot less excessive than ‘Die Another Day.’”

Bond's identity is that he is a masculine character. It's part of his character and identity. Superman's or Spider-Man's identity is not being Caucasian. He just happens to be and was portrayed as such. But there are no elements of white/Caucasian in their story. Contrast that with Black Panther where his culture and color is part of his identity. &&That's exactly what it's saying, and that's exactly what the people coming up with these ideas mean by it.  No matter how many Blades, Spawns, Hancocks or Black Panthers there are, the conversation won't change.&&That would work for a beginning story, so fuck it why not. 

Don't think they went that way&&Set in the 60's you say? With gadgets.&&Tomb raider reboot was an awful watered down adaptation of the most recent game instead of a standalone, well written entry in its own right.

&&Oh certainly. She evolved as the movies went on with all the mother symbolism. 

I just think it was pretty interesting, that’s why Ripley is such an androgynous name. &&I mostly agree.

So we've all heard of the show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, right? Well the producers hired Kaitlin Olson to be a regular cast member. In the first season, they wrote her as ""the straight man,"" who is basically the reasonable person for the main trio to contrast against to enhance the comedy. The foil is a pretty boring part.

As season two started, a number of changes were made. One of the changes was prompted by Kaitlin; she wanted to have more comedy and more eccentric scenes like the rest of the main trio. She was worried that she would be relegated to the sidelines as the show grew in popularity.

""I'm not sure we can do that"" they responded. ""We think you're funny, but we just don't know how to write for women.""

To which she responded, ""Well then just write it as if I'm a man.""

And that's how Dee Reynolds went from being the stereotypical nagging woman to a true member of the crazy and hilarious gang.&&Well the Xenomorph literally facefucks people and impregnates them against their wishes. I mean, everyone was basically getting raped in Alien.&&It was absolutely intended, there's even a scene where the android tries to kill Ripley by shoving a rolled up porn magazine down her throat.&&The Xenomorph design and creature has been confirmed by the creators many times as being full of symbology for rape and such&&The screenwriters literally said the rape element was intentional. I mean, you guys can look this stuff up if you want. &&No, the rape allegory was fully intended almost from the beginning. Dan O'Bannon, the screenwriter of the original Alien, was in a making of documentary in 2002, and he said his goal was “I’m going to attack the audience. I’m going to attack them sexually"". The first section of [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise)) has several sources that detail the development of the sexual aspects of the horror.

I think the most interesting part is that O'Bannon used the idea of male-on-male oral rape as a basis for much of the horror, because it really taps into the deep fear of emasculation and helplessness that straight men can feel in a male-dominated society. Straight guys were (and still are, to a large extent) not used to imagining rape from the perspective of the victim, so it was even more frightening because it was so unknown.&&It may have not been the intention originally, but later on movies embraced the symbolism. Alien 3 uses motherhood as a primary plot point. &&It was absolutely intended. Geiger was horrified of rape and when asked to do the stuff for alien, he made it entirely centered around rape.&&Only one way to find out ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Username checks out&&Not a secret anymore &&How did that film end tho?&&This is my cinematic fantasy, a series of MI-6 films using the cast & characters of Goldeneye. Trevelyan doing spy things from both sides; Bond doing his thing without being the undisputed main character; M, Tanner, Q, and Moneypenny covering/enabling their actions while fighting the delicate political battles that espionage entails...&&Born in 1990, so Brosnan was my Bond. His films get no flack from me. &&As well as Felix Lieter multiple times and Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye.&&That's why we have tomb raider&&I would definitely love to see that


the 80s or 90s near the end of the Cold War is a great time for spies with collapsing/consolidating Superpowers seperate from the Brits/Commonwealth of Nations&&> There is a lot of support for the M is a title theory though.

Theory? It's explicit, there is no theory involved. Bond calls Mallory (Ralph Fiennes character) ""M"" in [the final scene of Skyfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZKB6msBFg).

It's safe to assume that the head of MI6 always goes by the first initial of their last name. It's just coincidence that the initial happens to be M. 

It could also be that it's just tradition to go by M, as in the [real life counterpart to and inspiration for M, the head of MI6]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Secret_Intelligence_Service), who always signs the initial ""C"" in reverance to the first head of the SIS, [Mansfield Smith-Cumming]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_Smith-Cumming).&&That was Brosnan's Bond in *GoldenEye.*

As an aside, it would seem that Judi Dench plays two different Ms - one in the Brosnan era and one in the Craig era. Brosnan-era M was derided as 'the evil queen of numbers' - a bean-counting bureaucrat who had little experience in the intelligence community - in *GoldenEye.* Craig-era M implies that she is a veteran of the intelligence community in *Casino Royale.*&&Skyfall quite literally confirms that theory.

Mallory is appointed M at the end. I wish they'd named him something that doesn't start with M so it would be clearer to every last viewer on the planet that it's a title rather than a coincidental nickname.&&M is confirmed to be a codename

James Bond is clearly not a codename despite the fan theory&&I love the Bond is a code name theory, but Skyfall utterly destroys it. The groundskeeper to his parents estate calls him James, which means his actual name is in fact James Bond. &&You mean you aren't sexually aroused by watching a woman light herself on fire so that she falls ~3-5 feet and then impale her side on the shattered ribcage of the human remains beneath her? &&Which is Indiana Jones.&&Always been partial to the idea of the original Ghostbusters having mostly fallen apart and Winston pawning the Ghostbusters shit off on a group of fans that then have to figure everything out on their own.

You should be the someone else 😀&&[deleted]&&This is why I love John Wick. He grunts and struggles, and it’s a visceral experience I can believe. I don’t get that in a lot of movies.&&To be fair, Black Widow in the comics has gotten a bit of a watered down super serum to go with her training. So it's not like she's just a normal woman that can somehow go toe to toe with super villains. &&These are all really good points.  Both genders can be successful at something, but it doesn't mean they have to do them exactly the same way.

Even within the same gender, things can be done differently.  And that's okay!  My favorite example currently is Brianne of Tarth and Arya Stark.  Both are badasses, but you don't see Arya running around tackling and manhandling someone.  She's smaller so has to find other advantages.

But if Brianne decided to pick up some dude and break him over her knee, we would think that was completely believable.&&I would say that they didn't take her sex into account but they took her body into account which is more important&&The one shot takes really help it sink in&&She also uses her astounding beauty and sexiness. I’m all for more of that... just bein honest here&&Idk, there are some scenes where realistically, her kicking a guy three times her size, and him flying away doesn’t seem plausible. &&I’m postin up like a spider, gonna catch me a fly.&&That's the one. &&I got called a trash woman hater for saying the Ghostbusters movie was try-hard&&Hey, Oceans 8 wasn't that bad. It wasn't as good as 11 but I'd say it's probably on par with 13 (which is the weakest Ocean's imo).

edit: to elaborate, I feel that the movie's shortcomings had nothing to do with a female cast. I think the ending of the heist was a little overly convoluted so it felt more confusing than satisfying when the objective was complete. Not nearly as ""clean"" an ending as Ocean's Eleven walking out with $150 million cash and the girl.&&I thought it was okay. I went into it wanting and expecting a good heist movie like Ocean's 11, and it managed that for the most part. What I learnt through watch 8, though, was that 11 was good not only because there's a good heist, but because of the chemistry between the characters. There's just something about George Clooney and Brad Pitt that the cast of 8 doesn't capture.&&But if they weren't attached to the name they wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to flop in the first place. Studios just believe that they'll be the one who gets it right and that they'll have a 21 Jump Street remake instead of Ghostbusters.&&If 80% of them flopped they would have already have stopped being made. &&Because going to the movies is expensive. If I'm going to a theater it's either for a movie I'm 90% sure I'll enjoy either through reviews or the names attached, or someone else is paying. If it's a random new thing on Hulu/Netflix/etc. then I'm way more willing to give it a shot because it costs virtually nothing.&&Came for Charlize, stayed for the plot. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&It's got everything! 80s Music, Lesbians, Outrun, East Germany...&&One of the best long shot scenes I've ever watched.&&[deleted]&&S. Korean director usually.&&Everyone you mentioned is an ""updated"" version of a previous character. To relate it back to the original topic, that's like making a movie called ""Jane Bond,"" where she has the same job as James Bond, the same gadgets, and the same general premise, but her personality is different and the story is different. Which is the thing everyone here is saying *not* to do. 

None of them are wholly original. You can have Damian without Bruce or Kamala without Carol, for example. &&Even Miles Morales who replaced Spidey in Ultimate is miles ahead of Jane Foster Thor and RiRi Williams&&Nah, they accurately described the comics fanbase as being averse to new titles. Kamala Khan's success largely came from appealing to the YA crowd through alternative avenues, not the traditional comics fanbase and comic shop distribution method.&&You and me could rule this thread, Spider-Man!&&Eventually we will have enough alternate universes that we can fill out a Battleworld for an adaptation of Jonathan Hickman’s *Secret Wars*&&We also need 10 more Batman movies in the next 5 years, while we're at it.&&> Ghostbusters tried to remake the original with women. Super different.

The biggest problem with the reboot wasn't that they were women, it was because they missed what made the original team dynamic successful... not everyone gets to be ""Venkman"". The reason the original worked was different personalities playing off each-other and each fit the needs of the movie, but the writers missed that completely.  

You could take the same script and film it with men and it would be just as bad.&&I'd watch a beetle juice remake staring esteemed character actress margo martindale tho.&&I’m pretty sure the entire reason Oceans had women in it was because John Mulaney is the all forseeing prophet &&Yea at least Oceans did a spinoff using his sister and actually brought in some of the original actors.&&I really don't get the Ocean's 8 hate. &&[deleted]&&Jeez, I would have watched the shit out of a Wai Lin movie. It's always a treat when the Bond girl can outpace Bond.&&I just want a static shock movie. That would be pretty cool.&&It’s a bit funny that you list black superheroes who can hold their own and you have Miles Morales in there, as if he isn’t one of the most successful examples of a race-swapped character, and a two-fer on top of that.

Spider-Man in general just constantly spits out other versions of himself: Latino Miguel O’Hara, female Jessica Drew, black/Latino Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen. You could probably count Venom, Carnage, and other symbiote hosts as well. Not to mention the dozen I’m probably missing from that Spider-verse event.&&Green lantern is originally white, but a strong point&&> Miles Morales

Not that it's an issue, but isn't Miles and Green Lantern both just re-heroing of white characters?

Miles is basically Peter Parker but black. Dead father figure, great with technology, spider powers plus or minus a different ability here and there. Same relevant backstory.

Green Lantern's Hal Jordan basically passes on his entire ability set via a ring, which at least makes some reasonable sense because there are other Lanterns out there, but he's still first a white guy who then gives his powers to a black guy.

Why can't we have a more bad-ass version of Static Shock instead of reskinning an existing Super Hero?&&Hell, look at the popularity Luke Cage has seen despite some not so favorable reviews.

And Black Panther saw crazy amounts of success despite following the standard Marvel formula. (not saying it's a bad film by any means.)

I don't get why more people can't look to successes like these for proof that you don't need to change an already established character. 

We have a Captain Marvel movie coming out that people are really excited for as well. Atomic Blonde saw a lot of success. People loved Furiosa in Fury Road. Despite how much criticism Star Wars films receive, Rogue One saw a lot of success and had a very diversified cast. 

We've had plenty of proof that deviating from white male characters in the action/adventure/superhero genre can result in successful films, but a large portion of Hollywood is still afraid to take ""the risk."" And that's how we end up with all these articles about prospective female Bond actresses and arguments over whether a character should change genders. &&I was friends with Wonder Woman in a stunt show at Six Flags in Baltimore years ago and we had the black Green Lantern, and at every meet and greet and parade the dads would say ""they have the black Green Lantern that's what's up"". &&Plus, the stories you can get by racebending Superman are fascinating. An outsider who lands in America in the late 30s and appears as a black man but still seeks to defend truth, justice, and the American way, despite how society treats him out of costume? That's a story I want explored. I want to learn more about this character and his place in American society. 

There's a reason why *Red Son* is such a great series: taking the Superman archetype and shifting it slightly in order to explore his place in society makes a character that's really easy to write poorly much more interesting.

With Bond, that doesn't quite work (at least, not with gender). Bond's masculine nature is worth exploring but is pretty essential to his character. You could make a decent argument that the newer Bonds have branched out and  made much better use of exploring the toxic sides of his masculinity much more than earlier Bonds. It's much harder to translate that over into a feminine character. &&Yeah, but none of the tomb raider movies have been well written so that's about standard&&Well it’s a surname... her first name is Ellen. &&And I remember on the DVD commentary how Bishop uses a rolled up magazine to attack Ripley as he lacked genitalia.&&Let me just throw up for a second&&For England&&I want to see that hot Natalia Simonova again.&&Born in 1998, Brosnan is my bond.&&Well, that and polygon titties.&&""Damn, I miss the Cold War!"" &&Yeah, not to mention that in casino royale Daniel Craig says to Judy dench’s character something to the effect of “I thought M was a randomly assigned letter, I never had any idea it stood for” and she cuts him off saying “add one my syllable and I’ll have you killed” &&Yes.  100% this.  

M (originally Sir Mervey Messerschmidt, now a title for all filling the role) is a direct nod to Sir Manfield Cumming and the real life tradition with C. In fact, in at least one Bond film, you actually see a dossier with a hand written note signed with a green -M

Fairly certain the real Ian Fleming my have worked under the real Original C at some point.   Nowadays, the C is just taken to mean “Chief”&&is this an organizational wide rule?  because we know from the Brosnan movies that Q stands for Quartermaster.&&> Skyfall quite literally confirms that theory.

I think there is a video of Keanu practicing for the role where he is shooting targets and reloading like a fucking expert.&&It also helps that Keanu Reeves got real professional firearms and hand-to-hand combat training for the movie. Pretty much every move he pulls off in the movies would be more-or-less plausible in real life with enough skill.&&David Leitch, the director of Atomic Blonde, was a producer and an uncredited director of the first John Wick. So there are lots of similarities between the movies&&True, tho it hasn't been established in the movies. Don't get me wrong, I love watching her kick ass in the movies and its a totally different suspension of belief in marvel movies than in a movie like atomic blonde, which is aspiring to be more gritty and realistic. That is to say, I expect scar Jo to easily take on three dudes 5 x her size in marvel movies cause it's a marvel movie with super heroes, but I wouldn't expect it in a period spy thriller about a Cold War agent.&&In the films, however...&&For sure. I am a 170 lb dude and I would get destroyed by a 250+ Russian Cold War soldier face to face. I would be fighting like Charlize Theron i.e. Fighting for my life and I would be kicking groins, using lamps, gouging eyes, taking off steel toed boots and using them as weapons etc. 


If you're a spy and you're trying to be realistic, a slap won't send someone 10x bigger flying across the room. You're gonna have to work for it and use whatever you can to live. That's why I love those brutal action scenes in atomic blonde. And you can see the bruises throughout and the consequences of those fights. &&And the actual fight between them in the last season was legitimately the best scene for me.

It would've been better if they carried on a homage for the original.  Say that Venkman got successful post Ghostbusters II and began to franchise the place, hiring these four to man a new branch of the Ghostbusters in another town.

Let's get Jaden Smith to star being mentored by Will Smith's Deadshot, written and directed by David Ayer.&&Seconded. In today's super woke climate, I was wondering why nobody is making an SS movie since it is the most obvious choice. A black teenager superhero movie? That's like Black Panther, except more real! Pair it with a Batman Beyond movie and we're set!&&Please. I loved the cartoon as a kid and it feels like the character just faded into obscurity. Static Shock could make a great superhero film. 

We have Storm in X-men, critics gave good reviews for the Black Lightning TV show, and people were begging for an inFamous movie for years. There's a clear interest for characters with electricity powers, we have proof that the SFX can be done well, and they could totally cash in on the nostalgia of people like me who grew up with the cartoon.

He's like Black Lightning meets Magneto. Yes, please! 

🎶Superheroooooo Static Shock!🎵 &&That's the point though.

Miles Morales exists side-by-side with the original Peter Parker Spider-Man. He works because he is allowed to be his own character with his own thing, who just happens to have the same powers and moniker in his superhero life as the original Spider-Man.

You don't need to make Peter Parker black to get minorities representation. You just need to not immediately reject the next creative to come to you with Miles Morales.

You don't need to cast Bond as a woman to get women representation. You just need to not immediately reject the next person to come to you with Lorraine Broughton.&&I'm more forgiving of Miguel O'Hara than Miles Morales tbh. The back story for 2099 is a lot better. I like the story of him rewriting his genetic code better than ""oh uh here's another Spider-Man that was bitten by a different but similar spider""

Also I like 2099's powers more than Ultimate Spider-Man. Though both are great characters. &&The first movie was a hell of a lot of fun though, and Angelina Jolie nailed Lara Croft (of the time).

The new games are so good, especially the first one, that it makes me sad they didn't write a better movie.

Canonically, every one of the Avengers has superpowers in the books (although Tony gets his during the events Ironman 3 is based on). And Black Widow was a Cold War spy. That puts her in her 50s at least in the events of Avengers, so yeah, she probably has superpowers that the films just haven't really gone into for the same reasons they haven't gone into Hawkeye's powers.

*edit: OK I remembered wrong about Hawkeye. Apparently he's just a regular guy who can fire a 250 pound bow as fast as a machinegun.&&In the films she tanked a grenade in an enclosed space, got blown through a metal door in the process and shrugged it off like it was nothing.

I 100% believe the Red Room process that sterilised her also gave her low level powers. We know the Russians were experimenting with super serums at the time from the Winter Soldier program.&&This season has been so good&&> Sony Pictures is a dumpster fire

I know people irrationally hate that movie, but like its of its time. I just watched sword fish again ther other day and I cannot believe the shit that used to get the green light. They kill the main characters ex wife off as a way to solve a problem they make her a porn star, with her new husband so you dont feel so bad about their brutal murders. Also, they steal from the governemnt and run around using the money to attack terrorists who attack the USA.

I view him the same way as I view Supergirl, any of the Batwomen, She-Hulk, John Stewart GL or any other similarly clonal character. They just gender/race switch and then field-test in the main comic to see if it catches. Afterwards they run with it if it makes them money, but they don’t actually risk making an original ethnic hero.

VICE - Official Trailer,31903,9l0xo5,https://youtu.be/g09a9laLh0k,2839,1538571655.0,,"looks like studios threw money at Adam McKay after The Big Short and said ""Make something like this again""

which isn't a bad thing&&Seeing Christian Bale fat in a role is like witnessing Christian Bale being thin in a role.&&Holy shit, Sam Rockwell as Bush is the most perfect casting imaginable. They even did a fake nose that doesn't seem like it's going to be distracting. He and Bale look so accurate that it's kind of hilarious that they decided that Rumsfeld could just be a completely unaltered Steve Carell. &&Big fan of the exposition in W. and Cheney’s conversation for the purposes of making a good trailer. Because this was a good trailer.&&This whole time they've been selling Christian Bale as Dick Cheney when they should have been selling Sam effin' Rockwell as Geroge W. Bush. Hot damn! &&If this is as good as The Big Short, I would be very happy.&&It's so weird to see Rockwell as Dubya. It shouldn't work, but it does so well here. Definitely a must-see for me.&&Holy shit I didn't even realize that was Christian Bale until the end of the trailer. &&Steve Carell’s Rumsfeld is cracking me up&&“I belieeeeve.... we can make this work”

That sounded like quintessential Cheney there. I can’t wait for this film... and also all of these actors look amazing, but it’s still particularly shocking to see Carrell play Rumsfeld &&I swear the movie options this Christmas is looking pretty damn stacked&&Man, I am just all-in on these Adam McKay truth-is-stranger-than-fiction biopics. The Big Short took an incredibly complicated concept and event and made it not only digestible, but a really *fun* movie too. 

Now we have one of the most interesting American political figures of the 21st century, told in the same style. If they can turn a financial crisis into a quippy, fun and stylized ride, then I expect this to be beyond enjoyable and fascinating. &&i hope there's an after credit scene with the Bale Cheney doing an interview with Col. Erran Morad  and signing his waterboarding kit.&&Surprised by the use of The Killers' The Man in the trailer. &&I'm a hot little slut for Sam Rockwell. Count me in.&&Can someone do an ELI5 as to what did Dick Cheney do to change the course of history? Was it HIM who started the war on Iraq?&&I seriously thought Amy Adams was Kate Mckinnon&&Christian Bale, Sam Rockwell, Amy Adams and Steve Carell gunning for those Oscars I see&&Give a comedy director a hard drama and magical things can happen.&&[deleted]&&*Christian Bale is Dick Cheney*

This whole time?! &&From Batman to Fatman, the movie looks fucking great&&Wow. This looks phenomenal. Bale is uncanny as Cheney.&&Trailer music is The Man by The Killers, just in case anyone is curious&&For a second I thought I saw Michael Klump &&That's a damn good trailer. &&Wow. I thought that Josh Brolin was the definitive Bush (other than Will Ferrell), but Sam Rockwell looks like he's going to do a pretty good job too.&&If this is half as good as The Big Short, I look forward to being significantly pissed off for weeks after watching this. Looks fantastic. &&American Hustle 2: Iraq Boogaloo &&Christian Bale and Sam Rockwell in the same movie..I didn't know how much I needed this&&Christian Bale as Dick Cheney as Jeff Daniels.&&just in time with all the comments of 'bush era wasn't that bad' floating around. &&Nobody dedicates gaining and losing weight for a role [quite like Christian Bale.](https://i.imgur.com/6tbxmLq.png)&&Looking forward to seeing Cheney shoot someone in the face &&Christian Bale is a fucking shapeshifter.&&But will this film ask the question we all want to know the answer to: are Cheney and Rumsfeld lizards?&&I totally thought that was Jeff Daniels, not Christian Bale. 😮&&So Dick Cheney is fat Patrick Bateman. This jibes with my understanding of the character, and our former Vice President (who is evil).&&Sam Rockwell looks more like Christian Bale than Christian Bale does&&Can't fucking wait for this, looks excellent.&&Sam Rockwell is a SCARY good Dubya&&My god is it Christian Bale ?&&Well roll out the nominations... Christian Bales Cheney is spot on just from the way he speaks and that sly smile.  I am sad and excited for this movie. This guy was and is such a dirtbag but could be quite revelaing of how bad this republican party has become.&&My gut reaction was that this seems almost too recent to make a solid movie about it. 

It's been almost 2 decades since his first term began.

I'm gonna go yell at some youngins now.&&Christian Bale is running through the DC Universe. First he played Batman. Now he's tackled the Penguin.&&Damn, that's a pretty big part for Will Sasso. Good on him!&&For a second I thought I was watching Chevy Chase as Cheney and thought, what an odd casting choise.&&Adam McKay knows exactly what he’s doing. &&I don't usually see movies like this, but... Seeing Christian Bale fat and old is so intriguing to me.&&They should've called it ""Dick""&&Bale looks great but I'm having some trouble with the supporting cast. Rockwell is doing a good job in the trailer but I don't really see Bush, I just see a Southern Rockwell. Carell looks like Rumsfeld here but his voice is too iconic and sort of takes me out of the movie. &&Holy shit I almost didn't recognise Batman.&&that little smirky face and slight hesitant pauses in speech, searching for the right terms. goddamn bale is good.&&I can't wait to get angry about American history in a theater again.&&I *cannot* wait for this!&&I thought this was a movie about that trainwreck of a site Vice&&Now *that's* how you do a trailer for a film I had no previous interest in. Hot damn!&&Big Short was *so fucking good* that after I saw it in theatres for the 7pm showing, I immediately watched it again at the 10pm screening. The next day I went and bought the book and devoured it in days. 

My favourite movie of all time, definitely.&&LOVE Adam McKay.. he is a comedy genius and gave us Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers but I loved what he did with the Big Short and Vice looks awesome, so can't wait to get more of this style of movie.  Looks like he has another one of these in the pipes too.. Bad Blood with Jennifer Lawrence about a bio-tech company.&&What that really his belly or a prostethic?? Bale is gonna leave us early if he keeps this hit up.&&I thought it was David Wallace from Office at first.&&They accentuated the forehead for Carrell's Rumsfeld.&&Most of the shots of Carell in this trailer are him as ""Young Rumsfeld"". Peep 1:14 for the full makeup job.&&He looks like Brick Tamblin, the weather guy&&Carell has a bit of a vague resemblance, I'm having trouble seeing Rockwell as Bush. He has the voice and mannerisms but the appearance looks a bit off to me.&&Yeah at first I was like “he doesn’t look like Bush”, but then the voice and mannerisms were perfect and totally sell it. I’m glad they didn’t go overboard with the makeup such that is was cartoony. &&Honestly, it seems like he's playing Bush as dumb behind the scenes. I was hoping for something a little more realistic. Bush was a poor public speaker but he wasn't stupid in reality. The Texas good ol' boy thing was played up for his voters. I seriously doubt that Cheney was some mastermind who played Bush like a fiddle.

Edit: Well, I should've known better than to think everyone would just take my opinion on the trailer as an opinion. Also, perhaps Bush paid Yale a bunch of money or cheated or whatever to get excellent grades. The fact is his test scores at Yale *exist*. None of you have provided any evidence that he cheated other than ""I didn't like him and he sounds dumb.""&&Sam Rockwell as literally anyone is perfect casting though :P&&Yes, much more accurate than Josh Brolin in the Oliver Stone's trainwreck ""W""&&Seriously. This moved me from being interested in the casting choices but pretty uninterested in the movie itself into ""I'm watching this opening day"" territory. &&I wouldn't've expected it, but Rockwell's energy makes an awesome George W. Bush. It's a neat approach. 

And of course Bale is a motherfucking chameleon. &&Steve Carrell is Donald Fucking Rumsfeld! WHAT!&&He essentially channeled bush as Zaphod, so you could already see it then. &&That is a spot on Cheney though.&&Honestly, just have Sam Rockwell's name in the cast and I'll consider seeing the movie without any further information. He is the only actor who will do that for me. I like following directors and a few screenwriters, but Sam Rockwell is the only actor who is so fantastic at what he does that his name will actually draw my interest. It helps that he seems to attach himself to quality films. His performance in *Moon* is what convinced me that he was an actor I really admired.&&/r/castporn&&Yeah. I liked SAW in Three Billboards, too. &&No kidding.  Rockwell looks like a smaller, leaner W.  The facial expressions are spot on.&&Not sure if Sam Rockwell playing GW or Wild Bill from The Green Mile playing GW&&Aw man. Now I have to go watch him dance&&I would also add that, at least based on the brief shots in the trailer, Amy Adams appears to be delivering a perfect Lynne Cheney. She looks like her and has the facial expressions down. &&Sam Rockwell just sold me on this movie. Damn.&&Does he dance in this? Cause he should&&I'm jacked.

JACKED to the TITS&&I've never been more angry at a movie I loved watching than The Big Short. God that thing was enragingly great. &&The Big Short is seriously such a good movie. It's just so engaging, and it manages to drop quite a lot of technical information without feeling like it. 

It felt Sorkin inspired.&&[deleted]&&I saw Rockwell, and in the way he pulled off the mannerisms and the nuances that are W, he pulls it off that i see more W than Rockwell at times.&&And you *know* that mother fucker was actually digging in to a chicken wing when that conversation went down in real life.&&I thought it was Bradley Whitford for a second.&&I think bale can easily win this tbh. It seems like the best actor race seems weak to me this year? It was weak last year too.&&He nailed Cheney's speech pattern.&&I legit thought it was Jeff Daniels that whole time.  Incredible.&&Can't wait for Carell's delivery of unknown unknowns.&&All I see is Brick from Anchorman&&Really nailed how Rumsfeld's voice is much less intimidating than his vampiro-skeletal face.&&Thank god Battle Angel moved back, I want to see that do well in the BO&&Theranos/Elizabeth Holmes up next. That should have its fair share of bizarre events and characters.&&McKay is the perfect director for films like this and The Big Short because he understands the balance between absurd comedy and harsh realties. He’s great and I’m really looking forward to this one &&Honestly, turning The Big Short into that good of a movie is really impressive. I love the book and had a difficult time seeing how it could transfer to the screen, especially given how complex the subprime mortgage crisis was. &&Yeah spot on . Like that movie he did about the rise of 24 hour news channels.&&Just give me a Borat-style Erran Morad full length movie while you’re at it &&Lol...

https://youtu.be/Aw5NG580rBk&&Cheney and Rumsfeld became legit top-level political insiders as far back as the Nixon Administration. While other Nixon cronies resigned or were indicted, C&R basically filtered into the very high positions those guys left behind. 

So C&R both got valuable experience at the highest administrative levels pretty early in their political careers. This gave them a huge advantage in the bureaucratic battles of the next several decades.

Basically, among Republican politicans, C&R were the men you would turn to if you wanted to bend a huge federal bureaucracy to your will. They wouldn't get captured or overwhelmed by the process. They wouldn't get distracted by petty considerations like their own political popularity, and could always take the long view.

Their impact was probably greatest on the Defense Department, but it's likely that their combined impact also managed to influence the federal government as a whole.

Basically the C&R method was to maintain public decision-making processes for publicity's sake, but to take actual decisions in small trusted councils with little or no public footprints. This is what led to the Iraq war, but also to lots of other Republican projects.&&Yes.  Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were from H.W. Bush's administration and brought the grudge against Saddam from Desert Storm into the George W. administration.  Not that I think Hussein was a great guy, but its arguable they were more concerned with toppling specifically HIM than making Iraq a better place.  He ""signed off"" on the ""interrogation techniques"" aka torture of waterboarding, etc.  He's deeply involved in oil business and that was arguably also part of his interest in the middle east.  He literally *shot* one of his friends *in the face with a shotgun* while being VP, and the victim publicly apologized to him (in fact it looks like there's a quick shot of that event in the trailer).  If you don't know much about this guy, this movie is going to be fascinating to you!  Assuming its done as well as the trailer and McCay's past work suggests.&&So if you want less of an ELI5, and more of a detailed essay with footnotes, I'll copy [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/50xqdt/how_come_cheney_had_so_much_power_as_vp_why_did/d78gdpa/) I worked on a while back that took way too much effort, but seemed to be very helpful to a lot of people, and spurred [some thoughtful discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/51csdm/uadwinistrator_gives_an_indepth_wellsourced/).&&Era that changed a lot of attitudes and I think VPs overall power.

&&Are you even eligible for OScar nomination if Amy Adams isn't your female lead?&&Adam McKay has been very political for a while now&&I love how he's gone from the director of Will Ferrell comedies to one of the more highly acclaimed directors.&&He still has to face a slew of other actors who don't have an Oscar (he won Supporting Actor for The Fighter in 2010) some of those include...

&&Brick *did* go on to become a senior advisor to the Bush White House...&&Brick Tamland*&&He’s what you’d expect him to look like in a Hollywood movie, a younger sexier George Bush.

Not that Dubya was some chubby or buff guy but for his stature he seemed ...compact. Rockwell looks thinner. Other than that it's pretty good casting.&&I think hes got it all.

Oh no, it definitely felt like it.  The genius of that film is that it was able to do that so overtly and yet still be super entertaining.  &&Without feeling like it?

My only concern with this movie is that it's going to oversimplify Bush.

For all of the flaws in Oliver Stone's W., I thought it ably communicated Bush's intelligence and humanity. But because of the way he acted around the media and his constituents (his ""common touch""), there's sometimes a tendency to paint him as a rube or yokel when he was actually extremely intelligent. Opinions about his actual run in office aside, the dude is SMART.

It's almost the opposite of the problem his father had. HW lacked the common touch that would have endeared him to voters (and which, in all probability, lost him his second term to Clinton). W had it to a fault, to the extent that his legacy was tainted by it.&&Toby would have a conniption if it was Lyman&&Lol Bradley Whitford playing a Republican VP would be a sight to see, especially this one&&[deleted]&&I thought it was Dick Cheney.&&Yeah Gary Oldman and Daniel Day-Lewis are pretty weak actors.&&Bale, Gosling, Cooper are three guaranteed noms and three of the most popular actors alive right now.

/r/boneappletea&&Man was in the hunger games. &&There's a Frontline (PBS) episode called Chaney's Law that I believe addresses a lot of this.  You can watch it free online.  &&Yep. Public footprints are what end up with you in prison, and your man in charge getting impeached. They learned some valuable lessons from the Nixon era.&&Also, Cheney became the most powerful VP ever. &&Hopefully they also show his and Rumsfelds downfall during Bush's second term. 

Rumsfeld and Cheney were big power players during the first term, but early on in the second term, Bush for all intents and purposes and for better or for worse, remembered the lessons of his father and took control of the ship. He brought in General Stephen Hadley and promoted him to national security advisor and Hadley from anecdotes you hear from guys who were part of the administration, just basically cleaned house with the help of the likes of Gates, and Rice. They push out Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz. And as Bush got more comfortable as president, you also saw this huge right between Cheney and Bush in their ideals and relationship. And I think speaking on a foreign policy level, Bush's second term could be one of the better terms that a modern president has had when it came to foreign policy. Bush became realistic and was much more willing to work with other nations on treaties. Something that even Obama, as much as I loved him for his domestic policies, really struggled with for both of his terms because he allowed his ideology to ignore the realities of what needed to happen in the IR realm and the Near East. This is why you had people like Gen. McChrystal who had qualms with Obama and other senior officials in the administration on their apparently unrealistic views on the situation in the Near East. 

Hopefully the film will show how during the second term of Bush the Younger, they fell from power as Bush began to assert more a more commanding control of his administration.&&They go way back to Gerald Ford's time in office, and the magnificently named Halloween Massacre in the White House. Before the deep state was a thing, Rumsfeld and Cheney were fucking elite shadow masters of the deep state. They were the sleeping polar krakens of it, just slumbering beneath the ice caps, managing the levers of power far, far beneath the sun and warmth.

I actually agree with most of the politics promoted in his productions, but his delivery is (usually) the fucking definition of the ""liberal academic elitist"" bs that pushes so many moderate conservatives to hate liberals.

Bush obviously was the crux of it and for good reason but pretty much everyone else was more than just competent, Cheney was a mastermind by all accounts.

Hunh, guess I'll have to watch that scene again for ... reasons.&&Also the amount of champagne in her glass. Drives me absolutely insane. &&I don't think you can blame it all on the media. I'm pretty sure he and his PR team quite consciously built his image as a down-to-earth cowboy on his ranch kinda dude, when in reality he was raised in an influential, intellectual and rich family (with a very famous father, of course) in Houston (one of the biggest cities in USA) and went to Yale and Harvard.&&And this is the point of this movie.  Was it W.?  Or was it Chaney playing him?  
  
I think W. was a smart guy that relied too much on his adviser's opinions.  Trump is the opposite - dumb guy, which isn't a huge problem if you acknowledge it, but rejects his adviser's opinions.  &&He made some dumb decisions and said some really dumb things on TV that were considered far below what you would expect from a President. 

Now if we were to go back and look back at them, sure they don't look nearly that bad. But that's more because of how far our expectations and standards have fallen. 

For example, yeah maybe judging the 'working class' isn't fair in every day life. But you still wouldn't want one of them to be President without having the ability to articulate and communicate ideas properly. &&I'm of the opinion that he was a man of moderate intelligence that was seduced by harmful ideologies. The general approach in Afghanistan was actually decent when it came to the stated goals, and warranted in an interventionist mindset if that's your cup of tea. If the ring road could have been completed as originally intended, Afghanistan could very possibly have been stabilized against the tribal conflict and the state of governmental collapse that afflicted it. Any self-determining, nationalistic, democratic government in Afghanistan ends where the ring road turns to dirt.

Then the ring road was abandoned when the war in Iraq began and resources were funneled there. Bush honestly seemed to think that we would be seen as liberators in Iraq. He or members of his cabinet suppressed information contrary to the narrative of their ideology, [as made famous by Rove.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community) It's impossible to know whether Bush's true failure was an inability to accurately discern reality, an inability to assess risk given an accurately discerned reality, or a disinterest in reality altogether. I believe, though I only have the public information available, that it is the last option. Bush is a religious man, and America more than perhaps any other nation celebrates magical thinking. He deluded himself into the belief that he was not overplaying the hand he was dealt. Whether or not he actually looked at his cards or even understood the game is a question I can't answer. It doesn't really matter how intelligent someone is if they don't apply their intelligence to the reality at hand.&&""It's a very common mistake""

I don't agree with /u/GodKingofEarth that the parties are equal, but the D's and R's are both pretty good at portraying each other in a very negative light in the media. In the case of the D's, they don't tend to defend their own against legitimate allegations as much as the R's, and often the allegations against the R's are much worse. 

But in the cases like these, both parties throw down just about the same.&&Stankonia is gonna drop boms over Baghdad&&Japan is sending Playstations&&Who the fuck said that? &&

Most people who are fat got fat very slowly over time and their metabolism has long since embraced it, but he was probably force feeding himself a huge amount more calories than he would normally eat.

You're absolutely right, but Bush was being painted as dumb before he even became President and when he was just campaigning. He said stupid things and misspoke words, but so did Obama, albeit probably not as much, and that ""he's a retard"" stereotype about him didn't exist nearly as much.&&So I won't get into policy stuff because we'll politics is all opinion and doesn't matter for this discussion. But W's biggest weakness was his poor oration skills. He's not a dumb man, not matter how much he was portrayed as such in the media. He's a bad speaker. He isn't a yokel either. The guy went to Harvard. He is a Texan though and that's how Texans talk. Jimmy Carter had a similar problem in his day where he was depicted as a yokel peanut farmer. I think there is a bit of bigotry in it. Most of the big news companies are based up north and they likely people who talk and act like them. Probably one of Obama's biggest assets when running is that he was such a good orator and came across as cool and confident. So why can both succeed? Well America is a big place and values differ. In the south someone who seems approachable and friendly will be popular but someone who comes across as an academic will be seen as an elitist snob. In the north the opposite is true. A southerner would be seen as a dumb hillbilly and the academic will be a valued expert. You can see this with Clinton versus Bush Sr. Both are southerners but Bush spoke and acted like a Washington elite. Clinton was far more charismatic. &&""Do we have a civilization?!""&&Did Miles speak with an English or American accent? Ofc it's a testament to his ability but I can't remember the last time Bale used his own accent for a film&&VIIINNN—DIII-CAAAA—TIOOOOONNNNN&&#WHERE’S LAO?!&&I can only imagine - you worked your tail off for the highest gov't position for a year or so and you're thrown into the first days/years of your Presidency, and it must be just absolutely stressful and crazy getting into the swing of things. 

Meanwhile the advisers basically have 1 job to do and I'm sure it's easy to grab some power in the beginning or run your own things by the President with approval while he's got a million other little things to worry about.&&I don't have full control of domestic policy in my own house!&&Hillary actually talked about this and said how both Bill and Obama spent a whole lot of time learning and practicing to be as charismatic as they were as well as being good public speakers. 

Its an ability that isn't something you are naturally born with but can learn and improve and work on. However, just like any skill or ability, its going to come easier to some people than others. 

And that ability to pick up skills becomes a measure of intelligence as well as work ethic. 

I would go even further and say being able to articulate and communicate an idea is the biggest measure of intelligence. Everyone can feel emotions and have opinions on certain things. But few people are able to analyze and communicate exactly what they mean. 

And to a large extent, that is what politics is. &&He's had his own accent in at least a few films, Prestige, Reign of Fire and Empire of the Sun for example. The wikipedia page mentions Miles having a pronounced english accent.&&English, Miles was as steriotypically old gruff British worker as it came. Tank driver in WWII, and a good enough driver to know it. Can't wait for that movie!!!&&>  Empire of the Sun

This example is a bit disingenuous given  that he was **thirteen** at the time, not sure if he could've pulled off a different accent back then.&&",2018-10-03 09:00:55

I’m thrilled that he got to make a feature.&&Wait... this is a comedy?&&This guy is like Tommy Wiseau without the awful acting. &&Interesting decision to give review lines calling it a great comic performance, then having most of the trailer taken up by a heart wrenching breakdown. Either way I'm definitely looking forward to this one. That aforementioned breakdown is really intense, in the best possible way.&&Jimmy C: I think its great that you made your movie and its getting recognized. It will be very inspirational to other aspiring filmmakers. I def want to check this out!

Also: what were some of the films you were inspired by for Thunder Road? thanks!




&&I want to say the actor here is a redditor.... swear I saw a post with him and the poster &&Congrats on releasing your first movie! &&Props to the team behind this film, it's been getting a lot of buzz online and now I can see why.  Looks fresh.
&&[deleted]&&Saw the movie at the London Film Festival. It's a terrific tragi-comedy. Jim Cummings is a star in the making. Go see it.&&If it’s a comedy, it’s a really... powerful..? Comedy!?&&Will it be available through any other distributors on release?  Or is there some kind of apple exclusivity deal? &&Waaaay to depressing for me.

Looks intense though.&&A few years ago my screenwriting professor showed us the short film in class and I loved it. So this is pretty exciting to see and I’m looking forward to checking it out. Congrats!! &&Just got some tickets to see this at the end of the month thru my school district. Pretty pumped. &&This next Mad Max movie goes in a weird direction.&&Wow! I got a chance to see the short film this was based on at my school a few years back after it had been at Sundance. It was absolutely amazing how half of the audience was cracking up the whole time and the other half was heartbroken by what they had seen. It really is a great short that shows how grieving is a different personal experience for everyone. Can't wait to see how the film expands on the sad humor that was in the short! 

Also the short was all one continuous shot that apparently only too him 6 takes to get. &&Looks good. Remember us redditors when you move to Hollywood.&&Is this adapted from that short film of the guy who has a breakdown during a funeral speech?&&I heard /u/itsamberbitch said it's like a Tommy Wiseau movie but with better acting.&&This looks really awesome man, can't wait to see it. Congrats!&&Wow, this looks great. 

Your career has been building to this moment so it would be dishonest to say you're about to be an ""overnight success"", a phrase which usually discredits all the hard work to get there, but this is a rare instance where we get to see that singular moment that is about to make someone's career take off. It's fascinating to see.

Also, good strategy posting that picture of you next to the poster last night and the trailer today. Seriously. Well played Reddit callback.

Congrats man.&&This looks fantastic.&&I saw this film two weeks ago at a local theater. Fantastic film. Go and watch it, you won't be disappointed.&&I used the short film of this in a introduction to film production class I taught to high schoolers, using it as a complete contrast to the fast-cutting multi-camera sequences common today as well as communicating emotional closeness through camera distance. It definitely got student's talking! I'm super interested to see where this film goes!&&That's the best mustache this side of Milo Ventimiglia on *This is Us*.&&It is available somewhere for people without Apple accounts?&&I remember seeing somewhere you said you would rehearse the script from the original short in your car on the way to work and people would look at you crying in the car not knowing you were in character. Really incredible dedication and amazing to see how far you have come. You are a true auteur.  I can’t wait to see what you have in store for the next one!&&That Aphex Twin is top notch. I'm gonna direct my first feature next year, any advice for getting good performances out of inexperienced actors?&&damn good acting skills.&&Wait thats a comedy? Because that trailer is telling me its equal parts tear jerker and drama filled serious af&&Damn, the reddit marketing campaign for this movie is intense considering it's so low-budget. &&The fuck is this. &&This looks fookin terrible &&Can't tell if this is a really bad comedy, or a shitty serious movie. &&Photo makes it to the front page yesterday, and now the trailer? 

&#x200B;

Hats off to the marketing team&&Anyone explain why this has 3 gold?&&I'm sooooooo confused, wait let me go back and check....yep ""one of the best comic performances of the decade"" and I'm sitting here listening to one of the most dramatic monologues I've ever sat through, still thinking about how he said ""I love you"" and his daughter didn't answer him...&&How is this a comedy? Where is the funny?&&Looks really amateurish like a student film. Noy a particularly interesting subject either. How did this get so many upvotes and gold?&&Lol Reddit got so fucking played by this guy . Like a fucking flute. &&I wonder how much advertising they paid reddit to push this shit to the front page. This was on /r/all yesterday in the pics subreddit and it was just a picture of the lead actor standing next to a poster for the movie.&&I saw the post in /r/pics of the director standing in front of the movie poster which was gilded a few times and a lot of people posting the trailer in the comments. And now it's posted here gilded 3x.

This is starting to seem like some karma conspiracy to me. &&Can someone please explain the humor? I am genuinely perplexed and intrigued...&&This is a comedy in the sense that it's billing as a comedy appears to be a joke. &&Dude how does this guys stuff always hit the front page. I get it some is good but ALL THE TIME? &&It feels almost like a parody, I am a bit confused.&&This looks terrible.  I dont know what you people are smoking.&&[deleted]&&wtf&&This is deeply weird in a very good way. It gives me a ton of anxiety like a car crash you can't look away from. Tragicomedy at its finest Sir.&&Looks depressing af. Hard pass. &&Just watched this movie at London Film Festival. Fucking. Brilliant. &&[MRW I watched the trailer](https://gfycat.com/SadPitifulGopher)&&gheeyyy&&why would you market a comedy like oscar bait?&&The main actor in this looks almost identical to Henry Cavil. It's uncanny.&&Make sure to watch this at your closest Alamo Drafthouse™ and grab a refreshing, Low-Calorie Coca Cola© Product!&&what is the short that this is based off of? &&is this that guy from yesterday? Nice job dude!&&Can't wait to watch this. It looks good. I've been dreaming about taking off all my clothes and screaming at my coworkers for years!&&This movie looks pretty interesting, but I'm reading it's supposed to be a comedy (Pixar-esque). Definitely not getting a comedy vibe from this trailer... except that bit about Jerry bringing him breakfast, which made me chuckle and then feel bad about it because Jimmy starts breaking down further.

There's no Alamo Drafthouse near me in southern NJ - where might I see this?&&This looks super interesting, I’m really confused as to what the tone is though, seems hella intense either way.&&It looks like a big ol plate of heart wrenching with a side of laughter. Were can i watch it!?!&&That was some solid acting. I hope this opens doors for him. &&So excited by how everyone is excited for this beautiful film <3&&/u/jimmycthatsme, if you're still here or reading these... Thank you so very much for this film. I eagerly await your next project(s) and wish nothing but success for you.&&While the *movie* looks intriguing and potentially interesting, I'm sorry to say this is an awful trailer. (1) The comedy aspect really doesn't come through and you're going to disappoint both sides of that divide with how misleading this is, and (2) I really feel like that shirtless rant shouldn't have been in the trailer. Something tells me that's supposed to be a powerful scene and now you've just sucked most of the energy and effect out of it for me.&&Any chance you'll be doing an AMA here? &&Skip!&&looks like garbage , thanks for the ad tho.&&Is there no rule against self promotion is this sub?  &&Saw yesterday and it sucked&&this looks like the worst ever..&&Hey u/jimmycthatsme , I don’t usually like movies, but your trailer has me thinking this would be an experience that I’d enjoy. 

Thank you for the obvious passion and dedication you’ve put into getting to this point. Your hard work looks to be paying off. 

Also, if you reply to this I’ll probably show my son in a few years when your name is a household name. &&This looks super interesting, but I'm confused: is this actually a comedy? The trailer makes me think its a drama, but comments here are that its a comedy.  I mean, I want to see it either way.&&I feel like I saw the word comedy in the trailer a couple of times.  That word seems at odds with the trailer I'm watching.  Compelling, absolutely, but after watching the trailer, I wouldn't have described it as a comedy, unless it is extremely dark.&&I want to see this movie because I've heard great things about it. But the trailer doesn't sell it very well. Show this to someone with zero context and they won't know what to think. I'm not trying to be harsh. That's just my honest take on it. &&Jesus I'm not supposed to tear up at a trailer...

I think I need to see this movie. Jim, you're a monster you've done so much in this movie. I hope you make piles of cash and win truckloads of awards man.&&i'm thinking pass on this!&&Hey thanks!!!!&&How can I find the short film? &&What’s the name of the short film?&&For those who would like to watch the short film:  https://vimeo.com/174957219&&Should we avoid the short film for spoilers until we see the full film? &&Yeah it's a comedy. It's like King of The Hill if it were made by Pixar.&&Not that I'm not down for a comedy, but I'm really interested in the dark drama that the trailer presents...&&Yeah I have no effin' idea what to think.&&I saw that movie weeks ago. It might have some funny moments, but I wouldn't call it a comedy at all. A dramedy if you will. It is a good movie, but it's not here to lift your moral up from point A to point Z.&&I feel sad just after watching the trailer&&check out the short on that the feature film is base on. i watched it after seeing OP on /r/pics last night. absolutely wonderful. can't wait for the feature film to come to my city. 

&#x200B;

[https://vimeo.com/174957219](https://vimeo.com/174957219)&&No, seen it a couple weeks ago as it's already out in France, and it is nowhere near a comedy. It is a very tragic movie about a person who struggles to cope with mental health problems. Honestly went for a comedy and it was far from it !

It is nevertheless a very good film, with an awesome acting performance of the main character&&That's what got me. The review that said ""Best comic performance"". I mean, his sudden shift from rabid anger to appreciation was funny, but so many serious movies try to frame moments like that as completely serious and people are like ""SHH! He's emoting!"" so I thought it was unintentionally funny. This reminds me of one of the fake movies from Tropic Thunder. &&I was crying at the trailer, so .... &&This is going on the poster now.&&So nothing like him? Because that’s what makes Tommy amazing.&&Mike Nelson (Rifftrax & MST3K) once said the difference between a good bad movie and a bad bad movie is heart. 

 A good bad movie is one where you can tell the creator put all their heart into it (key examples would be Ed Woods films) but lacked the directorial, acting or technical skill to pull it off.

BTW, this looks like a great good movie.&&Thanks! The short is online! It’s a comedy drama thing too.&&That trailer was *insanely* well thought out and edited. The juxtaposition makes it even more intriguing. A+ work.&&Hey thank you so much! I’m a huge fan of children of men.&&OP is this actor, writer, and director of this film. &&Yeah! I posted that picture yesterday! That’s me.&&Here’s the post https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9neok0/proud_moment_for_me_my_movie_comes_out_in/&&Yee boy that's him making this post. Actor and director&&Thank you! It’s been so cool!!&&Hey thanks so much!&&Yeah would have never heard about it. Looks like a real gem.
And no I'm not welling up it's just really dusty around here!&&Thank you!&&But will probably blow up like Ben Affleck when Good Will Hunting came out.  &&He pulled off Casey Affleck? &&That's good cuz we need a replacement&&Pulled Casey Affleck off of a woman he was assaulting? &&Oh hey thanks! How was that screening? I’m sorry I missed it. I love London.&&That ain't Winnie the Pooh yelling at police officers!&&Being the voice of Winnie the Pooh wasn’t enough&&Yeah, comedy like Pixar. Laugh until you’re disarmed and crying.&&We’re supposed to be on Google play by the end of the month!&&Oh no! It is a comedy actually.&&Anyone know why this is upvoted so much that it's on the front page?

It's just a trailer for an independent movie that I doubt many people have heard of, I feel like there might some brigading going on&&Hey thank you so much! It’s so funny how many screenwriting professors show the short film when it wasn’t written in screenplay format.&&Oh fuck yeah thank you! Enjoy it!&&He's not mad.   More of a Disgruntled Max than anything &&Ah man. If there were a Mad Max between the first and Road Warrior i'd hope it'd be like this&&Hey thanks so much, and when we reshot the short film for the feature we shot it 18 times!!&&Oh I’ll never be Hollywood.&&Yep! https://vimeo.com/174957219&&She did!&&Thank you! It’s out in theaters today and it should be on the iTunes Store right now.&&Nah, I was a producer for 7 years before I started acting and directing. I had the chance to watch a bunch of other directors fail and that kept me going. I’m just very very lucky to still be making stuff.&&Thank you!!!!&&🙏🤘&&SICK! THANKS&&Oh sick! Thanks!&&I think he said it should be on Google play at the end of the month&&Oh thanks so much. Yeah, the car and the treadmill are my writers rooms :)&&Rehearse a thousand times.&&Thank you!&&Here's the short film, it's a comedy but not on paper: https://vimeo.com/174957219&&I wonder this too. This is a real piece of shit&&Reddit just really really loves feeling like they're in on an inside joke or something. Post hits the front page. then they see the trailer the next day and go ""Oho! One of us! A man of culture! We've seen this fellow before! I can tell people he's a Redditor like me, when he becomes famous!"" so they engage like mad.&&[deleted]&&This guy should be notorious for this by now.  His last project: https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7fxcjf/after_3_years_of_researching_space_fx_bought_our/&&Thank you!&&Hey thanks!!!!&&Very well done.&&Cause it’s funny.&&Thanks!

This looks like the same exact formula.  Done a little better, but still strangely misleading.&&I’m sorry to hear that! I thought it was cool!&&to be fair, I think dark comedies are a hard sell to begin with. I think this trailer did a good job at telling you what you're in for.&&I’m emailing with r/movies moderators right now! I’ll try to figure something out.&&By the looks of this thread, it may already be happening.&&Yeah I'm all for being supportive of people making art but when it's a paid promotion it's harder to get behind &&I don’t know why, but your comment made me laugh out loud.

I agree with you, too. This film seems overacted and cheesy. Maybe that’s the whole point though, and I’m a fuckin dumbass?&&It actually has been getting good reviews. Still though, the fact that this is upvoted so highly just because ""I am le redditor!"" is kinda eye rolling. No one outside of indie film or cinephile circles would care if this wasn't the case. That said I think it looks interesting.&&It's basically just a sub for film promos now.&&Wheather the creator post the trailer or someone else does, what's the difference?&&The whole thread is fake accounts praising this shit movie. Never seen a more blatant advertisement on reddit lmao&&Specifically why?&&Hey thanks.
Hi son. This is Jim Cummings on the 12th of October 2018, before he did all of that cool notable stuff. Your parents loved you just as much today as they do now. Follow your dreams.

And then coming back. &&I was shown Thunder Road by my high school English teacher as he wanted to show us what it meant to put something personal into a film and how that impacted the deliverance of the story. I don’t think there was a dry eye by the end of it. &&Don't know too much about you but I saw your pic on the front page yesterday and the pure joy on your face was life affirming. Not that it means much coming from a stranger but your success filled me with joy and I can't wait to watch your film.&&Thunder Road was my favorite movie of all the ones I saw at SIFF this year, happy to see it getting more attention!

I thought I was missing some inside joke &&Yikes, that thread. 

> This is a comedy? 

Pretty much what people are saying about this one too.&&That makes so much more sense

I saw the other post and watched the trailer. Of all the comments on that thread I only saw one chain that said something even a *little* bit negative (I thought the trailer was awful for a lot of the reasons now at the top of the post you linked)

Reminds me a bit of clone of clones marketing, but at least their songs were good

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯&&Something something ""can't please all the people all the time"" yada yada. I was pulled in by it, especially after the pause after you said goodnight to your daughter. Quiet and powerful moment right there; I've done that as a parent. When most trailers try to pull you in with explosions, you pulled me in with a very human pause. That's what film is all about and I'm excited to see this.&&Next time run it by e8odie, before releasing.  Thanks. &&Can't wait! Congrats on all the success btw! It's been great following your career since your short.&&I’ve never seen so many people equate screaming as loud and hard as you can to “amazing acting” lol&&the difference is one is self promotion and the other isn't. the rule is there for a reason... just because you like the content is irrelevant. &&Its was on r/pics yesterday too

What country are you in?&&schedule and budget and organize and everything!!!!&&thank you!&&[deleted]&&Yeah, sorry. Not a marketing company, just a dude on his iphone on a road trip.&&That thread looked a lot different before the posts calling it out got upvoted.  In fact, it looked a lot like this one.&&Thanks!!&&Thanks&&Sorry? About what?&&Small fucking world, eh?&&Holy crap!  That was intense.  But now I feel like crap.  But not in a good way.  But, in a good way, kinda.  I don't know.  I'm going for a walk.  I don't know when I'll be back.&&I had to stop six minutes in and take a break lol - he's so right, once you grow up it's crazy to think about what your parents do for you.&&Yes &&The concept and execution are very similar, but obviously the characters had very different relationships with their mothers. The Bojack episode made me feel lucky that I have a great mother, this short film made me feel guilty for being a selfish son.&&thndr rd&&CGI in this movie seems very realistic, will there be a 3-D release?&&will do! Just looked up IMDB: A police officer faces a personal meltdown following a divorce and the death of his mother.&&Damn. Well done. The tension between gut-wrenching loss and nervous laughter plays out so well. Is this scene part of the feature?&&Not what I'd call comedy. Humor is very subjective, so I guess it just doesn't work for me watching a guy having an emotional meltdown during the funeral of his mother.&&I don't know. I get that it has little jokes mixed in, but damn man...that eulogy had me legit tearing up. Amazingly believable acting.&&Man, that slow zoom in is *intense*.&&i don't get it... it just made me sad the whole time and i couldn't find the comedy, is it because english is not my main language?&&I know I'm late to the party but I just had to share with you. I'm sitting here holding my phone crying like, I don't know why but I am and I know it's just a short movie but it has touched me very deeply. Wow. Just wow. Not what I expected at all. &&What a great job capturing the regret one feels realizing how much a dick we are to our parents growing up. And for capturing how awkward a funeral can be. During the ulogy at my grandmother's funeral, my cousin told a story about my grandmother I hadn't heard before. It was so hilarious and I burst out laugh/crying and got a lot of looks from all her church friends 😂&&Absolutely terrific. It's funny and sad. I cant wait to see the full length film. Congratulations. &&Should I be weeping or laughing? I can’t tell how I feel and need someone to push me one way or the other. 

I love it &&Yea I may have missed the point, but I had no idea it was a comedy. &&It's edited super well for a drama! I guess I don't get any comedy vibes at all, outside of the review blurb that called it a comedy. 

In any case, it looks great.&&""Listen here me... You gotta get your shit together."" &&Sit yourself down, son. &&Seconded. The trailer is really good but I got bleak drama (with maybe some darkly comic moments) thrown in.

The raw emotional outburst of the main character being the central part of the trailer -- there isn't anything *funny* about it out of context. It might be funny if say, Farva from *Super Troopers* was doing that exact same thing, but without context, the main character seems like an earnest guy, so the outburst is tragic and not funny.

Coupled with the slow editing and the sad piano music, it seems like more Oscar-baity type drama/melodrama than something that's bleak but funny like a Todd Solondz movie. The reaction shot of the daughter at the end makes it seem like it might have some sweet and funny undertones, but this trailer does not prepare me to laugh.&&Could I get a swab of your taint as well?&&🤠&&https://imgur.com/a/8Wufjpi

Edit: nvm I found it haha. Watching now!&&So I'm confused why this is being sold to us as like a drama about alcoholism and mental illness. At least that's what I'm taking away from the trailer. It looks awesome. I'm just confused about what prompted this choice for the trailer.&&I just want to say how moving your performance was to me. I love watching live plays because you can see and hear all the emotions portrayed in the same room as the performer with your natural senses. Every once and a while, I feel those sensations with cinema - hell, I watched this on my smartphone. Your subtle nuances of stuttering, flustered emotions and awkward timing was masterful.

There's no comedy over this. Just because there's a certain degree of humour in something doesn't mean it's ""comedy"". 

Still looks like a great movie, just a bit misleading. &&What if the guy got a free churro first?&&same. i appreciate the production and the acting is great & believable but that was just not enjoyable to watch and the attempts at humour felt weak. &&Yeah I honestly felt like crying and I love dark humor.&&This entire damn post/thread is just filled with kiss-ass's.  As you said there is no comedy here, no dark comedy.  Just because a film has 2 or 3 'heh' moments does not make it a comedy.    

This is not saying its bad, in fact it looks good. However OP's/director/whatever's constant push to call this a comedy is confusing and makes me want to not see it.&&I’m so sorry!! I wish I could hug you!!&&I agree. Looks like a pretty good drama though.&&I legit had to rewind to see if it said it’s a comedy or not. &&Yeah for real, I keep seeing everyone calling it a comedy and im just like huh? Is this one of those reddit jokes i dont understand or is this an actual comedy. Because that trailer definitely made it out to be a drama. Like a straight drama and not a dark humour dramedy or something like that. It looks like a great movie but if it is supposed to be a dark comedy movie, I don't know how well the jokes will be perceived.&&Can I get a copy of your last colonoscopy vid, too?

Edit: Woah, wait...comedy? Definitely not the vibe I got. Now I'm confused..but intrigued? Confused.  Definitely confused. I think I have to check out the short.&&Wow, those are some solid reviews. Gonna have to check this one out.&&But will you feed me popcorn while i watch it?&&I just want you to know that I think you're going places!
I'm mainly here just so I can say I said something to a celebrity before they were famous.

I look forward to watching your movie!&&So can this film still get picked up for a wider release? I'd imagine if you wrote it, directed, and acted you would be in place to cash in handsomely? Or is it just going to be a limited release.&&As someone in “the biz” on the acting side... slow... clap... dude. Well done. I can totally appreciate how tough it is just to get something made.

>*Yeah feature cost $190,000 American, and we tried our absolute best to get picked up by as many people as possible and we made a few cool deals and we’ve doubled our budget just from theaters around the world!*

Memo's and notes are great just sometimes you need something to help you organize your workflow. Speaking for myself I use good old Google docs as it lets me share my work with my writing partner. My story notes go in the doc underneath my work and my story ideas go in notepad.&&[Thanks!](#spoiler)&&Haha, I assure you it was a welcome cry. Amazing job on the short film, it’s almost surreal to have you apologize for it cuz it was such an awesome experience. &&You cannot possibly be sorry for this. If you had not done your job so well, there would be no emotional response. Way to go :) &&I just watched the short.

That hurt somewhere in me that I can't explain. I laughed and I cringed and when you apologized before sitting back down for fucking up I just lost it crying. Fuck, man. That was...I don't know. That hurt and it was beautiful. 

I need to hug my wife. &&*dongle not included*&&You don't know me&&a barrel of monkeys for sure!&&Awesome short, man! Just forwarded it to a buddy of mine who loves Bruce Springsteen. He tells us to show a little faith every time we're at the bar&&Does the new version have the same awkward pauses and off-hand comments? I love how *real* it feels. Sometimes movies bug me with how perfect the actors speak; I want to see people slip up words, have pauses in their speech that portray them lost in their head trying to find the right word to choose next. 

You do that perfectly in the short, it's incredible.&&That's awesome to hear it's the opening scene. My first worry was that I'd seen the best or most crucial scene of the film already. &&Was the divorce in mind when you made the short? I just watched it and there was no mention of divorce, but the person who I assume was the wife seemed uncomfortable, so I felt like there was definitely something going on there.

Congratulations on the movie! Super excited to see the full film.&&Was not planning on watching anything tonight, but I was hooked in the first few seconds. I can't resist a good one-take. When he's rambling about the song as it begins, then Bruce starts singing and James immediately starts singing -- genius!&&It's black comedy, which is still comedy.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy&&I can understand that point of view, but . . . I dunno, in the short, I think the attempts at humor were supposed to be incredibly weak. It's a guy who has been shattered, and is trying to hold his pieces together under a 'haha, I'm okay' facade. As a viewer, it's not ""haha"" funny, it the tragic absurdity of this guy trying to act like he's okay when it's painfully obvious he's not - and everyone else trying to pretend with him. Leading to absurd moments like that nice lady telling him he did a great job, and him asking if he has to leave - I bawled my eyes out watching the short, but sometimes you just have to laugh at how crazy the situation is.&&To me it didn't feel like it was attempting comedy.  The dancing part just made him feel more human.&&Please be kind...Always rewind.

Can I ask you why the daughter acted the way she did especially in the end?&&I loved the short and could totally see the comedic tone. Being able to laugh as tears come streaming is an amazing feeling.&&Haha everyone says $190,000 because that’s the SAG low budget cut off mark, people always spend more than that when you factor in everything else.. but then you have to give the actors more money which.. you don’t have money for.

Maybe the rest of the tone of the movie is a bit different, but if you showed me this trailer without that quote and aked what genre is this I would have never in a million years responded with ""comedy"" &&That little girls actions spoke louder than the womans. See's her dad crying and just wants to give him a hug, but then they sit down and she doesn't even look at him.

New ‘Creed II’ Poster Shared By Michael B.

Edit:  Yes, I've corrected the spelling of his name.  I thought it looked weird when I typed it.&&That's not even close to the real height differential between the two sides. Rocky and Adonis must be standing on boxes.&&So many nipples&&I'm trying to imagine Ivan Drago as a daddy. Staring at a dirty diaper with those dead eyes, croaking - ""I vill *change* you.""&&Passing the torch just got serious.&&This gives more credibility to the theory that Adonis kills Drago's kid in the first act and the rest of the movie is Stallone and Lundgren training and having one epic final fight.  Bonus if Stallone uses Skeletors ""Let this be our final battle"" line from the Masters of the Universe on Dolph&&Stallone and Dolph better have a rematch&&Story is so predictable, but I love the drama.&&So....

He was humiliated by the USSR's main rival in his hometown.  His own people were chanting Rocky! How do you come back from that? What direction did his life take after that? Did he become a drunken recluse? Did he abandon the USSR? Did the USSR abandon him? And even if they didn't what happened post breakup of the country and the fall of communism?

So many questions. Hopefully they go into that in this movie.&&Can someone fix the poster to show how much bigger that white guy is?&&This looks like a video game poster. For a second I thought this was some kind of tie in with a boxing game!&&Adonis and Drago Jr are gonna fight and Jr kills or fucks up Adonis which leads to major beef and then Rocky and Drago fight just like I want

Or Adonis kills or fucks up Drago Jr and then Rocky and Drago grudge match

Either way Rocky and Drago better old man fight otherwise what's the point &&imagine drago's kid just destroys creed in the first couple minutes killing him. Then rocky is in the middle of the ring holding creed, looking up at the new drago. 


""if he dies, he dies"". 


Rocky jumps out of retirement and starts training at the geriatric center for seniors and starts crushing it. But the fight has to happen in the soviet because the US isn't going to allow a 70 yr old man fight a 20 yr old killer. So Rocky is back in the frozen tundra at the log cabin where it all started wondering what he's gotten himself into. He trains like he has never trained before; running up snowy mountains, outrunning cars, and picking up his family on a wagon in a barn. Meanwhile, new drago is getting injected with the most high tech, Chinese steroids that has ever been made.  His training menu consists of all high tech gadgetry would make Mickey roll over in his grave.


The big day arrives, the cold war 2.0. Rocky has muscles on top of muscles wearing the American flag shorts – Creed and Apollo are looking from the heavens cheering him on.  The national anthem plays and new drago is wheeled down the aisle standing atop a mini tank glistening in oil and sweat that would make 20 yr old SJW cream his pants. 


Face is stone cold- stern, unmoving, emotionless.


The bell rings and the men face each other while the ref is sputtering instructions in a foreign language he can’t comprehend.  All he can think about are Apollo and his recently fallen protégé.  


The bell rings and all mayhem breaks loose. Rocky runs in and dodges a jab then another, then lands a hook. New drago is unphased, he uppercuts Rocky and decimates him. Everything goes white.


“Hey Rock! Rock!”


“ey, mick? Isat chu?”


“Yea, it’s me, ya bum!”


“I know, I know, I’m getting up.”


“Not this time kid, you’re done for.”


“no no, I can do it.”


“No it’s over, Rock. Remember Mr. T? The training. The struggle.  The money we tossed away on that training center?”


“Yea, it was great, Mick. The lights and cameras. Expensive stuff. Wonder how much that cost”


“prolly like tree fiddy”

It was at this point Rocky noticed that Mickey was a 500 foot creature from the paleolithic era and all the training and preparation was the mental ramblings of a deranged senior.


Creed 2 – 2 Creed 4 U
&&This has me thinking.... We need to see some prequels starring Mickey. &&Well that's about as boring a poster as it gets.&&Isn’t Stallone like, 5’8 and Lundgren is 6’4? &&Creed II: If He dies, he dies&&Michael B. Jordan's got a pretty weak chin.&&Prediction for the movie:

-Adonis gets depressed following not having a real purpose for fighting, distant from his now pregnant girlfriend/wife (she’ll go to rocky worried)

-Drago & Son call out Adonis for a fight and Adonis takes it against the advice of his mother, Rocky, and just about everyone 

- Fights alone w/o rocky in his corner

-Adonis misses the birth of his child for the fight

-Adonis gets absolutely DESTROYED in the fight and ends up in the hospital with girlfriend and new baby

-Adonis redeems himself within himself as a parallel to Rocky making final peace with Creed Sr. + Creed “force” ghost appears

-Training sequence

-Adonis loses the majority of fight only to knock out Drago’s son in the final minute of the final round

-Drago & Rocky make peace &&I really, really hope that Drago and Rocky have a moment in the movie where they reconcile.

I really, really hope that it turns out Drago has been begging his son the entire movie not to take the fight, the same as Rocky.&&I remember first seeing Michael B. Jordan in the show Parenthood and thinking that he would never be able to play a leading role because he's missing his chin. Boy was I wrong. &&I hope Carl Weathers has a cameo as Chubbs.&&Spoiler alert: Creed is uncontrollable and kills Drago Jr. Drago Sr. Comes out of retirement and Creed kills him too. Then Rocky comes out of retirement to face Creed, and Creed kills Rocky. Then Creed goes on a murder spree and kills the audience.

&#x200B;&&Giant nipples 2. &&Looks like a drawing&&TWO WORLDS COLLIDE! RIVAL NATIONS!&&Apollo and Baby Drago kill each other in the ring. Rocky and Papa Drago have to avenge them by stepping into the ring. &&Nips War &&Whoa baby, Sylvester Stallone once again pinning the hopes of a good movie on the acting chops of Dolph Lundgren. That is a big bet to take. 

I recall back when he was making the Expendables 2, there was a great article that came out during production that spent a lot of time around the dynamic between those two, and specifically how Lundgren was almost having a meltdown trying to give something that would approximate a ""performance"". 

Meanwhile, Creed was a really good movie, and I'm sure they want to keep making good Creed movies. Expendables was fun, but a throwaway project. This is the real deal. Good luck to Dolph. &&Remember when big budget movie posters were still movie posters?  Look at Alien for crying out loud.  Rosemary’s Baby, Deliverance, The Shining. The Deer Hunter.  Those were movie posters baby&&TITTIES&&All those fighters pictured and not a flattened nose in the bunch&&I wish they weren't the same height&&I guess the other two don't get their names on the poster.&&Creed almost loses, then wins. Movie over.&&Sly looks weeird. Like a doll&&So help me God, if this is an elaborate ruse and Adonis dies in the ring only to have Rocky get into the ring to fight again, I will flip a shit.&&Weight class issues can be handwaived- im more annoyed that Drago jr. has zero resemblance to Drago sr. &&I get the feeling that Rocky and Ivan are going to get along, that they've both changed. That they're the two that are going to try to get their sons to understand that this isn't on the two of them, you know?&&Who's playing Scott Stapp?&&Why is Stallone turning into the queen of England?&&Expendables in the Ring

Also, couldn't they make Stallone a little less... Plastique?&&Stallone looks like he's wearing somebody else's skin.. that looks weird. &&Stallone's facial surgeries are freaking me out... &&Gee i wonder whos gonna win in this cliche tale of an underdog boxer&&It could be explained that Drago was exiled/seen as a turncoat for his public display of respect to the American Balboa.

Don't forget - it took YEARS for the Chernobyl firemen to be properly memorialized.  So I could totally see Drago pissed at Rocky for being exiled at the tail end of the Soviet regime. 
&&if i can change

and you can change

EVERYBODY CAN CHANGE &&Yes, and in this movie they'll gain more respect for each other and have solved the Russian Troll problem.

Or

Yes, but after being relocated to Siberia after losing, Drago allows envy and revenge to consume his heart.  He takes to the women of the village and sires a herd of mini-Dragos who are forced to fight amongst each other until the one victorious mini-Drago is strong enough to fulfill Dragos quest for revenge.

In both stories, mini-Creed and Rambo are screwing with Pauly's robot and hijinks ensue.&&Just work is so that it was all a show for the cameras. As soon as Rocky left Russia, Drago is sent to a gulag and his wife is killed. Drago is offered the chance to redeem himself via his son.&&Sure. They're mates now. Their sons are just having an exhibition match. THIS TIME IT'S CONVIVIAL!&&No. Rocky and the Russian people come to a mutual respect. However, it’s not really suggested that Rocky and Drago came to respect one another. Though Drago does admit that Rocky is like a piece of iron during the match.  &&Yeah but then the Russians interfered in the us presidential elections allegedly, so Rocky and Drago are back fucking in it!&&All I'm asking for is a montage to Hearts on Fire so I can relieve Rocky running up the mountain. &&Maybe itll be a story about how hate consumes and Drago Sr. is actually a good guy trying to teach his son control and sportsmanship but Adonis and Jr.  have to learn the hard way. &&Just in time for Cold War II&&Yes that's why they will kiss&&No.  Rocky made his speech to the Russian people, the people in attendance.  The speech was not directed at Drago.  Drago was a tool, and Rocky defeated that tool.

It was an...unfortunate marriage.""&&Hammer Lang?&&Played by Rampage Jackson&&I want to see who plays James Brown dancing in a leotard&&I wonder how they’ll do that. Rocky’s premise was rocky facing intimidating opponents. And with that giant son of a bitch facing off against Creed, they’d basically have to find someone as intimidating as Mr. T in his prime to face off against Adonis. 

&&Plot twist, he's half Mexican, so el Martillo Lang. &&Creed: Cold War&&Creed II: Brotherhood&&Rocky IV 2&&Yeah it looks so...typical. I can’t find the right word.

Night Shyamalan movie about a scientist who can smell crime&&Dolph&&Is anyone going to spell his name correctly?&&I'm just hoping for some pull penetration &&Oh fuck I thought that was Eric Roberts.&&I literally just said 'HOLY SHIT THATS DOLF!""&&Hell yeah

Also I get the feeling they're going to humanize him a bit. It's been a long time. Maybe even show that he has some remorse for what happened to Apollo.&&I honestly don't give a shit about Creed and am hoping that in the story the offspring take a backseat to focus on the old grudge between Rocky and Drago, with maybe a chance at redemption or healing for the latter. The way that Lundgren described his character and the suffering he endured since his loss in IV felt poignant and potentially interesting.&&Rocky IV was the best.&&No since they'll clearly pit him as an enemy to Stalone and imo they left the ring with mutual respect and something that could resemble friendship&&Ha! Good eye. They Tom Cruised them.&&They're also staring through one another. Obviously none of these guys are in the same room/image but there's something....... directional about their eyes that says ""i'm actually looking in the distance 30 feet ahead"".&&Meet my eye line, Jim!&&Ivan Drago towered Rocky back in the day, I was thinking the same thing&&Equity&&I bet they just put a ping pong ball on a wire and stuck it to Stallone's' head so Dolf had the correct eye line. &&Yeah wasn't that kind of a selling point in RIV that he towered above him?&&Eyes are the nipples of the face &&Eye of the nipples&&I feel so uncomfortable that nipples are so close to the title.&&I count 2.5&&If he poops, he poops.&&If he cries...he cries.&&Otherway around Drago Jr. kills Adonis. And then Rocky JR must save the key. Didn't he have a kid?

Apparently Rocky JR became an accountant in Rocky V, so the most of the movie is going to be good old montage where Rocky makes him son become a fighter.&&Would it be like the fight in Up!?&&""You wanna ring the bell, Drago?""

&&Not impossible they exchange a blow in a heated argument. 
You would expect them to show that in a trailer to get people in seats though, so probably not.&&Dolph would send Stallone to the hospital again&&in the streets!!!!&&Yeah the story is always similar but the acting, drama and training montages make up for it&&They have a few avenues to choose from, albeit some would be ridiculous, like Rocky getting in the ring.  But Creed can still lose in the end, and someone can still die, so there is still some room for huge spoilers.&&It is, but I like to compare it to a (sorta similar) Boxing anime called *Megalo Box*, where you know exactly what's gonna come before it does, but the journey, music and just about everything else more than makes up for it.&&Hey he said everybody *can* change, not everybody *would.*&&I think they changed, and then they changed again. &&What if Rocky brought down communism by fighting a boxer 2x his size? And he had a robot butler.

&&Imagine a super ripped, super smart scientist in a mesh tank top, named Doctor... Dolph Lundgren.&&I mean, I get what you’re saying but Drago having a son is about the most believable thing I can imagine. People be having kids, like, all the time.&&Before impregnation....

**I must break you!**&&I agree. I thought it would be cool if they went a different direction with it instead of just rehashing fan favorites. Maybe Drago's son doesn't want anything to do with the family legacy or something.  Creed was sort of the ""Casino Royale"" of the Rocky franchise and I'd like to see that vibe continue.&&That's kind of the whole vibe I get even without this poster. I've never been a big ""Rocky"" fan anyway but this just seems so cheap and easy. A money grab. 

The entire movie is basically based off of what you said. ""What if Drago had a son...and he fights Creed's son...and they hate each other and like...Rocky hates him too and they're all super mad at each other because of the other stuff""

&&“Who looks like that one guy who looks like Tom Hardy”&&Nah, let me guess creed struggles in the first half then he defeats the other guy. Do i really need to see this?&&Didn't he also play himself in Rocky Balboa, or am I mistaken?

Why's he so bad?&&Black Panther&&I think it'd be funny if he dies and it causes everyone to storm out of the theater. &&Real talk, I am more excited to see their side of this story because of things like this.&&Not even that. 

Technically, Drago was their champion. He murdered a man in the ring, then lost just a little while later. 

Now his home country, that’s in the middle of the Cold War sees him as a loser and a waste. He stepped into the spotlight to immediately get humiliated. 

He killed a man in the ring, then lost. Who’s going to fight a guy who can kill you, that’s already been beaten? It’s not like he’s undefeated. He already lost. So any other fighters would be risking their lives for a fight with a guy who’s already been taken down. There’s neither prestige nor point to such a risk. 

So he and Rocky have respect for each other, but it’s the classic end of movie issue. Yeah, the story is nice, but I’m a realistic timeline, Drago still has to go home at some point. 

So now, after major investment, his defeat is considered a humiliation for his home country at the hands of their bitter rivals, and he’s a killer who lost all prestige when he lost in a revenge bout to Rocky. Nobody cares if you beat him. We know he’s beatable. 

So yeah, him and Rocky are good, but that’s about it. He’s a disgraced golden child. Rocky can’t do shit for him in his home country. &&Can you explain the reference to the Chernobyl firemen? Why did it take them so long to be memorialized?&&But how did Drago publicly display respect for Rocky? He just fought him. It was the audience that showed respect by applauding him.&&Just once I want the antagonist to have turned out to have walked away not a bitter husk.

He’s a disgraced golden child. Rocky can’t do shit for him in his home country.

Even if he and Rocky were good at the end of the movie I think it's perfectly realistic for those feelings to have changed over time, or even almost immediately, once he returned home and all the factors you outlined came into play.

But honestly, I'm hoping Ivan Drago might just be caught between his child wanting to redeem his family name while Ivan is just doing his best to help his sons career.

I think that would make for a much more compelling story since you can draw parallels between Adonis Creed's own issues with his Father and Rocky that we saw in the first movie. I'd be really into an Ivan Drago who doesn't hold any particular grudges with Rocky Balboa and plays a more sympathetic character to contrast the menacingly stoic threat he was in rocky 4.&& Mostly had to do with the coverup of how bad the situation was.  But the two foremen who scuba dived in to manually shut it down saved hundreds of thousands of lives, if not more.&&Drago still lost.

To be fair, I'm kinda getting that from the poster. He doesnt seem all that angry/begrudged/serious to me. The expression he has is more of a ""I'm sorry we are in this situation again, but I must do what is best for my son/protege."" &&Hmm, yeah I see. There's also this theory I read that Drago threw the fight and let Rocky win:

>And you know why he threw it? Because he loved America and he loved capitalism, and he wanted to bring righteous American values to his own country. The idea that Drago was representative of Soviet values was bullshit. We all remember what Drago declared before the 15th round. He bellowed at his handlers, the Soviets in attendance, and the fucking politburo: I WIN FOR ME! FOR ME!

>For me? Does that sound like a Communist to you? It doesnt sound like any fucking Red Ive ever heard of. And youll notice that he only said that he wins. He didnt say he wins boxing matches. Thats because he never intended to win that boxing match. His goal was to let this noble American come into Moscow and, against all odds, emerge victorious, thus displaying the magnificent virtues of capitalism for all of the Soviet Union and its citizenry to see. I mean, you didnt see Drago rushing to stop Rocky during his climactic speech, did you? Fuck, he probably wrote it for him. The broken English is a dead give away.

Would be really interesting to see if this comes up in the new film in some way. Although it probably wont.&&Adrian&&It makes sense that Clubber might have had illegitimate kids while he was still boxing.&&I'm with it. while it would be something different it would still stick with the theme of defying the odds.

He has 20 years on Mbj. White is 50 Jordan is 31&&Just get Baby Slice himself to do it&&It would be John Cena and you know it&&Am I the only one that doesn't understand the premise of his vengeance?  Apollo got himself killed by being unprepared to fight Drago.  Rocky refused to throw in the towel and save Apollo's life because Apollo TOLD HIM TO.  It was about the delusional pride of an athlete past his prime. Apollo was NOT murdered by Drago.  Drago didn't even do anything wrong.  He fought the fight according to the rules. Apollo was murdered by his own arrogance and inability to recognize he was past his prime.  That was the lesson Rocky learned and the entire point of the film about the Cold War! (arrogance gets us all killed)  

Sorry, this movie, from what I can tell from the trailer, understands Rocky about as much as The Last Jedi understood Star Wars. How the @#$@ are any of these lessons being communicated by this ""vengeance"" bout?  The proper lesson here would be not to accept the fight at all because Adonis's motives are personal.  But I didn't like Creed either, so what do I know. Adonis's character makes no sense to me. &&Still too soon&&Creed: Black Flag&&Rocky IV was a great film with complex themes about politics and identity.  Apollo = American gaudy arrogance complete with James Brown's Trumpian casino spectacle (""Livin in America!"").  Rocky = American humility and dedication to a larger purpose.

Those three lines kind of disagree with your premise.  Drago went into the exhibition with Apollo with all intents to fuck him up.  And was completely REMORSELESS about killing Apollo.

&&Wait, what? Who didn’t like *Creed*? &&Perhaps you should watch the film and see if they actually address that? Because trailers rarely capture nuance ion films, or even present them accurately, so making those kinds of judgments off of them is usually foolish. &&/r/DragoDidNothingWrong
&&> Am I the only one that doesn't understand the premise of his vengeance? 

**”trailer spoilers”**

It’s heavily implied in the trailers that Donny is basically using “vengeance” as a pretext to fight Drago Jr., and he’s in denial about it. 

Edit:

> If you want to fight this man, then that’s your business. But don’t pretend it’s about your father. 

I don’t know how they can make it any clearer that it’s not about actual vengeance. 

PS — the “I don’t care. He killed my dad” “line” is not actually from Creed 2, it’s a modified version of what Iron Man said to Captain America in Civil War (“I don’t care. He killed my mom.”)...you know, the film both OP and your respondee are referencing. &&Yeah I’m not understanding the point of this movie considering the ending lines.

Especially the comical 'slug fest' between Drago and Rocky.&&So if you go watch any boxing match, say on youtube, fights really dont play out like they do in the rocky movies, im sure someone actually familiar with the sport will give more insight but basically the boxers in rocky seem to take way way more punches than normal.

Also especially in the non heavy weight categories of Creed you're mostly playing for points rather than KO afaik.&&>  the spectacle I don't think is portrayed as ludicrous or 'too much'

Comparatively, Rocky had to leave America and his plush capitalist dream of a life (he had a fucking ROBOT BUTLER) and train in the Russian mountains in order to toughen up enough to beat Drago.

Forced to protect some innocent people. Im a simple man at times lol.&&THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. &&But where's the twist?&&No, no, it needs a twist like that Sixth Sense movie.

You know, like where that was Bruce Willis *the whole time*!&&It was a fun movie. &&Isn’t that Rocky’s whole shtick tho? I know how unrealistic it is but his thing was he was impossible to put down&&Rocky I kinda made sense. Rocky III he starts off with a lot of quick hit and run punches. Then later on he abandons reality for a pretty cool scene. Rocky IV though is completely insane.&&Exceptions aside, thats pretty much spot on.&&Offense + no defense = losing if you're boxing someone who isn't a can.  Even the most aggressive boxers use damage avoidance/mitigation in their game plan.  Mike Tyson was notorious for being unrelenting but watch his earlier fights when he was composed and on top of his game.  He fought ""peek-a-boo"" style utilizing the ""Dempsey roll"".  Jack Dempsey was an old time heavyweight who had lead hands and discovered a way to attack while being hard to hit directly.  

Tyson would seemingly charge his opponent head on but then you notice he was constantly bobbing and weaving avoiding longer armed boxers.  While bobbing and weaving he would use the momentum to throw counter hooks and devastating body shots in close range.  This continuous dodging and punching was the above stated Dempsey roll.  Tyson also utilized a lunging hook also utilized by Dempsey.  Normally a boxer puts their weight even on both feet or favor the back foot so they can side step or push off the back foot for a power punch.  Tyson/Dempsey would sometimes load their weight on the lead foot and leap at the opponent delivering a surprisingly powerful hook with their lead hand.  

Tldr - Tyson used aggressive pressure combined with insane bobbing and weaving to get close to his opponents and THEN smash.  Defense is more important than offense.&&What bothers me is how much all TV/movie boxing looks like Rocky.  I feel like basically true boxing is just too hard to train an actor for so they do Rocky-boxing instead.

Like, you watch a real boxing match and the first thing you notice is how literally *zero* movies look anything like that.&&> He came out and danced around like a fool for 10 minutes and then got punched in the face and died.

>Comparatively, Rocky had to leave America and his plush capitalist dream of a life (he had a fucking ROBOT BUTLER) and train in the Russian mountains in order to toughen up enough to beat Drago.

Interesting, rather than a critique of American patriotism or foreign policy it seems more of a statement that ""good times create weak men"" as we have seen the cycle play out in history.

Peter Parker (Earth - 616/potentially earth - 96283)- Classic friendly Neighberhood spiderman or maybe raimi universe spiderman

Miles Morales(Earth - 1610) - the new kid on the block who turns up after the peter parker of his world dies

Spider-Ham (Earth - 8311) - Originally a spider bitten by a radioactive pig turning him into a pig with the abilities of a spider...

Spider-Man Noir (Earth - 90214) - A spiderman from a  more darker crime ridden world, he uses guns and kills people.

Spider-Gwen (Earth - 65) - Gwen Stacy bit by a radioactive spider becomes a female spiderman. In her universe peter parker becomes the lizard.

Instead of bothering with Venom and their other awful spinoff ideas, SONY could have easily made a great **animated** cinematic universe, starting with 'Into the Spider-verse', and really carve out a nice niche for themselves that no other studio is doing at the moment. But instead, their greedy ass just HAD to make some pointless Spidey-less Spidey villain universe that NOBODY wanted.

So awesome that they even included that.  Can't wait for this movie.&&It's hard to believe this looks this good and Venom looks that bad.

Sony you Crazy!&&Didn't know that was Brian Tyree Henry! God, this cast is ridiculous&&Imagine if they released some DLC based on this. I want a suit that makes you Spider-Ham!

And I know it's probably impossible (or at least wildly impractical), but if there was a way to make the whole game look like this movie, I'd shell out in a heartbeat.&&The ps4 spiderman has recently been added into the spiderverse comics.&&Yuri Lowenthall was always a voice actor I liked but his performance as Spider-Man was next level. Easily my favorite incarnation and performance of the character&&I mean, it's implied that Peter Parker *dies* in this movie. At least, the one from Miles' universe.&&No. It’s Peter Parker. Horrible things happen to him. You know, the whole with great power comes terrible luck and all that. &&Is it really a Spider-Man story if bad stuff doesn't happen to him though?&&Honestly I'm amazing Peter isn't a depressed wreck with all of the soul crushing shit that happens to him in every media.

&&I was expecting the meme, not a feels trip. Bravo!&&the feels&&I mean, If they're going to do a slow-pan across The Great Web, they'll be showing everything they legally can.  

They did something similar in 2009's TMNT Turtles Forever, panning across the multiverse showing an enormous amount of Ninja Turtles spinoffs. [This lead The Shredder to go insane and try to destroy the multiverse to destroy the Turtles](#spoiler)&&> but I'd die if at the end of the movie we get like a glimpse of the greater Spider-multiverse, with little peaks into the other universe. They'd show Raimi's Spider-Man, the Garfield Spidey, MCU Spidey, Spider-Man PS4, and even some of the animated ones (Spectacular, Ultimate, that 90's one with the cool intro). 

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show basically did a 4 episode “movie” where this happened; the “newer” TMNT interacted with the cheesy 80s group and the comic book versions as well, and then there was a scene where they showed the live action film versions and other fan art versions. 

It was indeed pretty epic fan service. 

PS — the best part of the film was even “new” Michaelangelo growing tired of the 80s TMNT shit, like just walking around in public and broad daylight despite being ninjas, and for some reason constantly referencing Pizza Hut during times of crisis.  

Basically “y’all ninjas be crazy”&&if they do that,i hope mcu spidey is just a live action shot of Tom Holland just playing a videogame&&>Amazing

Uhhh what&&Spider-Ham looks so much like a 2D render, it’s great. Wouldn’t be surprised if he actually was just like the Looney Tunes were in Space Jam, the animation definitely gives me those same vibes. This film is gorgeous.&&I hope Sony makes a zillion bucks off this movie, because I think animation is a better medium for superheroes than live action. It encourages this kind of creativity. And if this movie is a big hit, hopefully it'll encourage other filmmakers to consider animation. &&Peni is also anime stylized. &&And in the intro about Peter, he's claymation or similar.

I'm gonna be so lost if I don't.

I didn't even know Spider-Ham was a thing, thought it was just a Simpsons joke. &&There's a good chance this movie will be more than so-so. Animation alone makes this movie really interesting.&&Even without spiderman you could still get the plot to work WELL with the symbiote. But it just looks super generic.&&Venom isn't even hard to get right. seriously as an Anti hero more or less(other than against spider-man), all you have to do is make his reasons for doing what he does seem logical, and not make him into a total fucking asswhole.

Look at the punisher, or deadpool. That's really all you have to do is take ques from those movies to make a Venom movie good

I do wish they would have had spiderman in a cameo or something though in venom, it would improve it.

IF sony wants to make a mini cinematic universe with Venom, I really do believe they should find someway to make a deal with marval to have spiderman appear in some capacity in a venom spinoff's. It could just be a flashback, or in the future too.

Then again I just really want Venom to get the series he deserves. he is imo a really great anithero at the end of the day.&&So spoilers for those that read comics: Spiderman from the ps4 game has made it into the most recent events of spiderverse in the comics.&&That costume has grown on me so much since its reveal.

Gonna be wearing it for Halloween. :)&&I feel like a lot of the problem lies on Sony’s interference with Venom. The way Hardy or Fleischer will say something and then backtrack later because the studio probably got pissed. But imagine saying ‘shut your fucking mouth’ to Tom Hardy. &&Marshala Ali is also in it too:)&&The vintage suit is a lot of fun to play around with.&&You can see the advanced suit in this trailer as well.

Superman just isn’t video game material. &&Dude, Homecoming is a full-on comedy. &&I agree with Tom Holland as the best. I look at it as Maguire was the best Peter Parker but wasn't good at being Spider-man. Garfield was good being the wisecracking smart Spider-Man but was a bad Peter Parker. Holland is the best because he plays both sides great. &&[ProZD was a pretty solid Fisk too](https://youtu.be/wywB0S52cKw).&&Aca-be-*liev* it.&&I don't think he's necessarily a deadbeat now that we have a little more context. He's just broke because he's from another universe, and he doesn't exist (or is dead) in Miles' universe.&&Yeah, maybe I am mixed up on that.&&In the Miles' Universe, he isn't the first Spider-man.  There was a second universe running alongside the Original Marvel-616 universe called the Ultimate Universe or Marvel 1610.  In 1610, Peter more or less has the same origins, but the world tends to be a little bit harsher and things were slightly different, I.E. mutants weren't natural, but created by people trying to recreate Cap's super solider serum.  Also the green goblin was not just Osbourne in a suit, but more like an actual monster.  Kind of like how scorpion looks in the trailer.

Peter dies saving Cap by diving in front of a shot from Punisher and being beaten by Goblin and a bunch of other goons to save Aunt May, and his ""family"".  Miles had been bitten months before, but decided to honor Spider-man by taking on his mantle with the blessing of Nick fury.

The Spider-verse series more or less displaces Miles into Marvel-616 and that kind of ends the Ultimate universe as a comic run.&&His voice was the right amount of deep to me.&&[deleted]&&When he gets a good movie and actually feels like trying, he's a top tier actor.

I just couldnt look away. It was so vibrant, full of life and energy. It was distinct and unlike the other shit you see in cinemas.&&A Venom movie without Spidey could work... 

However, I don't think they can pull off an origin story without Spider-Man.&&> all you have to do is make his reasons for doing what he does seem logical, and not make him into a total fucking asswhole.

*Relatively* logical, even, considering one of his biggest points is that really he's just sort of nuts.&&i'm not familiar with comics but really loved that game.  Which comics should I be looking for to see his introduction?&&I hated it at first, the Red/Black/Blue motif is so iconic that adding another color seemed like a terrible idea, but I've grown to love it, and the eyes were always white so it's not like the color is out of nowhere.

Not only are they somebody that they both loved but not really, they're also reminders of their biggest failures and something they blame themselves for. &&If they don’t do this it’s an extreme missed opportunity.

But if they capitalize on the extremely easy emotional beats that are right there in front of them it could be the most memorable superhero movie this year barring Infinity War &&Damn, I don’t even read comics and this made me tear up a bit&&I figured but as nobody that isn't working on the film could have that info, I answered as best as anyone could. &&She even went to school with Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Kowaru.&&And then I’ll say “I’M GAAAAAYY” no no that’s too much hold back hold back &&His enemies include the Sandmanatee, the Kingpig, Raven the Hunter, and, of course, the Green Gobbler. &&Dude you do *not* want to get into Spider-Ham's backstory, the continuity there is a *friggin mess.*

Sometimes he's a spider who got bit by a pig. Sometimes he's a pig who got bit by a spider. Sometimes he's a spider who got bit by a pig but also he lives in a world of anthropomorphic pigs, *not* spiders.

I'm not talking about different adaptations or whatever, that is the actual character's messy backstory that new writers just totally overwrite without bothering to explain or even research what the established history is.

**It doesn't make any sense. It changes randomly. There is no rationalizing or explaining any of it.**

E: I do not understand everyone telling me not to take it so seriously. My first sentence is that you shouldn't bother getting into it because it's ridiculous. &&You’re telling me he was a spider named Peter Porker, or did he change his name to the pig pun after becoming a pig?&&What!!!???? How did I not know this?&&This Friday? YESSSS&&September 11th... through September 19th, 2012.

If he ever comes back to my city I'm getting tickets no matter the cost. JM is amazing.&&Probably a more pg version of that story cause that storyline is fucking brutal. Also lots of spider on spider action &&The Spider-Man in this movie has mechanial web shooters. Spider-Man 96283/Raimi-verse has organic web shooters.   
  
Also the diner scene is very different. &&He wasn't in the suit for the car through diner scene in the original though. So who knows.&&I thought that too. Weird that they wouldn't just use their own new version of spidey but at the same time, kind of cool that it feels familiar. &&Gripping his left wrist.&&Don't let your life pass you by, weep not for the memories&&*I will remember youuuuu*

CHANGETHECHANNELCHANGETHECHANNELPLEASEGODWHEREISTHEREMOTE!&&Boo. Thanks for confirming, though!&&No love for Gang-rape Greg?&&Even into the early 2000s. We got Batman Beyond, the X-men teenager reboot, Spectacular Spiderman, ect.&&It's a shame nobody seems to remember the Superman and Iron Man animated series.&&Marvel considered Iron Man to be one of their B-tier superheroes when the movie came out, but they'd already licensed out Spiderman, X Men, and Fantastic 4 so he was one of the more popular ones they still had the rights to when they decided to make their own movies.

Then the movie was great RDJ's Tony Star was incredibly popular, and Iron Man became one of the most popular superheroes out there.&&Not without some *serious* suspension of disbelief, like The Force Unleashed where Starkiller's lightsabers become funnoodles because if they behaved like we know movie lightsabers to behave, 90% of the game wouldn't work.&&My understanding is that the game was largely horrible, but I still think there's a ton of potential in the *Superman Returns* mechanic of **Metropolis** having the life bar and you lose when Metropolis does.

You make Superman video games interesting the same way you make Superman comics interesting: don't make them about whether or not the unkillable guy is going to get killed.&&Say that to Rico Rodriguez. Dude takes falls from 500m after jumping out of a fighterjet and loses MAYBE half his health. I love the Just Cause games. &&Nah dude there are a million ways to do it. Someone like Rocksteady could kill it.&&Make the bad guys in a video game have kryptonite or magic, both of which are  Superman's weaknesses. Or make the bad guys kryptonian or other super strong aliens. Missions fail if too many civilians die or if Lois leaves Kent. Include epic battle with Shazam or Batman. Problem solved.&&Hulk Ultimate Destruction was pretty good - Superman *does* have weaknesses, it's just bad writing to pull the Kryptonite card every 5 minutes.

I think the Man of Steel game actually had a really good philosophy. Superman was invincible, but the city wasn't - so your ""health bar"" was actually a measure of how much destruction the city was suffering.&&While I know in movie genre speak it is a comedy, it’s a very realistic adaptation of what would actually happen if a 15-16 year old suddenly got those super powers. The jokes are just real, it’s great.&&To be honest I can't really compare them. Like they all have their own quirks which mirror the comics in someways, with Raimi's films feeling very 616 compared to TASM which feels Ultimate inspired. The MCU Spider-Man is in his own little bubble of being a optimistic but incredibly inexperienced Spider-Man, which lends himself well for future character development and for him to become a Spider-Man similar to what we see in Spider-Man PS4.

Spider-Man PS4 is easily my Spider-Man. Everything Insomniac did with the character and the lore just clicked with me instantly, starting with the prequel novel.&&This shit that Maguire wasn’t good as Spider-Man always seems to be a rationalization that he has to be bad at something for the other two to be good. Maguire was a great Spider-Man and so is Holland. Maguire is the fleshed out college Spidey that Stan Lee wrote about and sure, he’s cheesy, but he’s just like those comics. Holland is an actual fleshed our version of high school Peter Parker, remember - Spidey was in high school for like 30ish issues, nothing really given how long he’s been around.&&from my understanding original peter Parker was always kind of scraping by money wise, he’s more so full time Spider-Man and part time Peter Parker and just manages to get by as to not worry his loved ones &&There's a chainsaw duel with a demon.

I don't know what else you need to know.&&Mandy is fucking DOPE, it's one of the most beautiful and intense and cerebral things I've seen in a while, and I watch a shit-ton of movies. Definitely check it out.&&Nonsense, Mandy is fun for the whole ^^^^Manson family!&&He’s got a lot of back taxes to pay off (for real). Mandy is definitely a labor of love and not a quick paycheck &&Wait wait wait ... He named his son Kal-El ?&&No he can't. He's a pig.&&Yeah it's like there's a sequence in the Spider-Man PS4 game where Spidey makes reference to how he stopped the train in Spider-Man 2, but they're not the same universe.

Same thing I imagine with this film, I mean Spider-Man literally punches the car back out the window in this trailer whilst wearing the suit. It's a reference/call back to Spider-Man 2 and not meant to actually be the Raimiverse.&&Which is basically what they did in the PS4 game, funny enough. Seemed to result in a pretty fantastic SM, lots of references and evidence of old villain suits, raimi film scenes, etc.&&You know, I've been looking at some old reposts, and they seem... very familiar&&I've read that so many times and I still don't fully understand why Captain America didn't help him after Spider-Man after he took that bullet for him. I understand he was in a fight, but man it was all so confusing and heartbreaking. It was right after Cap was talking about Peter possibly having a legitimate role with the Avengers and how to become a better hero. &&(x4)&&Her issue is packed full of anime refences all the EVA kids are in her class.

Edit:  [Here's a panel](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/848/284/c25.jpg) &&[deleted]&&I think they’re just being cute, and playing fast and loose with their Classic Spidey lore. Raimi’s flicks have some of the most recognizable Spider-Man imagery out there, so they’re gonna feature those beats. I’m sure references to other source material is gonna crop up but for the trailer they’re using these, because they’re some of the most popular and well-known. 

I especially loved the twist on the diner scene; it’s as if that’s how he personally recalls the event going down, instead of what actually happened.&&2099 is my favourite. I'd like a movie, but I'd also like it not to suck.&&*sniff*&&So can we get Teen Titans back?&&Was Spectacular any good? I never saw any of that one &&The Iron Man series improved greatly after the first season. The theme song still gets stuck in my head. &&As someone who hasn't played those games, can you describe the difference?&&The game was indeed mostly horrible...but that mechanic was great! Also it was really good at making you feel like Superman.

Just the story and the fights were meh. He wasn't given enough Superman things to do.&&Including the best friend who gets everything wrong and is supportive af.&&That was true for younger Peter Parker, but this seems to be an older incarnation, where he has been everything from teacher to photographer to scientist.&&I don't need anything else. You got me hooked.&&Bruce Campbell is returning? :D&&Was that guy really a demon? Pretty sure he was just insane and evil. Definitely a great chainsaw battle though.&&So it's a 40k movie?&&I thought it was a joke, but nope. Kal El Cage&&That was such a cool moment.

""Aw, come on! That totally worked last time!""&&In the PS4 game, there's a side mission where you stop an impostor Spidey from running around. The impostor is voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes, who voiced Spider-Man in the 90s animated cartoon. The meta-humor is really strong at the end of that mission, because he ends the dialogue saying something along the lines of, ""I'll leave this to the professionals from now on.""&&I'm gonna have to work out with him next time someone plays interdimensional hookey&&As well as Ghost in the Shell's Section 9 and Simon from Gurren Lagann. I suppose we can't expect references like that in the movie, but it would be awesome.

But I do hope for her to show some visual anime tropes like the big sweat drop.&&And characters from Gurren Lagann!&&Also, the comic takes place after the game so if you haven't beaten it yet don't read it!&&and Spider-Verse is what this movie is loosely based on! &&I’d pay for a Science Station DLC that allows you to switch the environmental graphics to match the different suits, just so I could swing around inside a comic book, just as we did with Ultimate Spider-Man. 

I also want a mode to play the game in the third act, where there’s more... activity from the various factions happening, but that’s something for another thread. &&a spider bitten by a radioactive pig? ok that's where I draw the line. Master Chief let's get outta here&&He was adopted by May Porker after she bit him.&&Yeah, it really is. That's Peter's defining trait. He will suffer and he will persevere. &&Spidey is an enteral paragon of guilt and a misplaced sense of failed responsibility. There is no joy in being spider man, only more and more regrets the longer you go on. And yet, he always manages to push through somehow. &&One of the characters in the comic storyline was [Pavitr Prabhakar, aka Spider-Man India](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Pavitr_Prabhakar_\(Earth-50101\))  
He essentially has an existential crisis when he realizes that he, and the rest of the Spider-People are alternate universe duplicates of 616 Peter. &&They're both different versions, not the versions they loved from their respective universes.&&probably ""not really"" because they're from different universes so there's bound to be some differences between the versions each of them had loved in their own universes :p&&Or some of his other superhero friends, like Batt Burdock AKA Deerdevil, Nick Furry of S.H.E.E.P., and Goose Rider. &&Nothing beats Black Panda. &&>It's like looking at an eclipse, dude.

I remember that when I used to get sick and would miss school, I would watch the TV and there it was: the amazing spider man and his amazing friends. It wasn't like the Spiderman TAS or the MTv's Spiderman, but it was entertaining.

Nothing made me feel more depressed outside of that specific part in spiderverse... well, maybe in Marvel Zombies return with Spiderman trying to redeem himself for his mistakes which costed the lifes of his friends and MJ from an alternative universe...&&I had exactly two issues of the original 2099 run, and those alone made me fall in love with the character.&&What, you mean, was I cool? *Yeah.*&&fucking yes how have you not heard the immense praise that show has received? watch the intro and tell me it doesn't make you hyped 

https://youtu.be/2S19w2xXU54

the show was really really good but got canceled after 3 seasons. would highly recommend anyways, it doesn't end on any cliffhangers and the seasons wrap themselves up by the end typically.&&To keep the gameplay action packed and tense your lightsabers don't just bisect anyone you connect with, they behave like generic action game swords.&&The lightsabers didn’t cut through enemies like you thought they would. Without special protections, a clean hit would lop off whatever limb it hit which didn’t happen in the games. &&The last Peter Parker I remember has a company that rivals stark industries... &&I will add that the movie is absolutely not for everyone. The first half will turn a lot of people off. &&Seemed open to interpretation on whether or not the LSD was just a super powerful drug or some kind of glimpse into another lovecraftian dimension or whatever. &&I think kal el is a cool name&&Seriously, the writing for that game is done so well. One of the suit powers is Quips!&&As a huge fan of the Raimi trilogy I lost my shit at the references to it. There's also a lot of subtle references to old and obscure comics that I loved so much.&&I'm a little salty they didn't spring for j.k. Simmons as j. Jonah Jameson. That would have just been so perfect.&&It’s even better than that. He says “Spiderman no more” during it, which is literally the name of the comic that inspired Spiderman 2. &&Did he tragically lose Uncle Ben to...an uncle ben recipe..&&At someone who's never read any of the comics, I have no clue who's kidding and who's kidding not any more.&&Even not-Peters like Spider-Gwen and Spider-Man 2099 have that trait too.&&Got it in one. &&this shit writes itself&&I wanna read the comic now. I love all these damn puns!&&Thanks, I hate it! &&Yeah dude I legit gasped like a 10 year old when I saw the spidey and friends panel. I grew up watching that series&&# WHAT?!&&Ah. Gotcha.

From a game design perspective I see why they'd do that, but perhaps they could have also thought of a way to have it make a little bit of sense, at least.&&They already ditched that storyline and made him broke again.  Because comics can't allow for real character development. &&I really wish activating it was accompanied by cartoony POWs and BAMs when you beat up people.&&My preferred suit power as all the other ones are either way too op or way too useless. At least this one fits the character.&&Perfect and expensive.&&I'm fine with Reinhardt.&&The voice guy who did JJJ did a helluva job imitating JK's performance&&I just assumed it was him and didn't hear anything that made me think otherwise. Whoever they had did a great job.&&I'm not sure if Ben Porker met him. May went a little crazy after inventing a radioactive hair dryer thing. &&Not kidding. He's from a world where talking animals are the norm and May was a mad scientist.&&Stupid Spider Totems... &&I want to know more about the pig&&Zootopia style Spider Pig movie&&I'm gonna start at an 11... AND THEN JM GONNA TAKE IT TO A 15 REAL QUICK&&**OH HELL YEAH**&&Also because Peter isn't Otto, who is the one that set up the company when he was Superior Spidey.

Had to know it was going to be a temporary thing.&&I wonder if that would be relatively easy to add in. The assets are there with the sticker mode in photo mode. Possibly something they could add with an update?

Either way, can't wait for new game+ and the dlc! &&Yeah, it really makes you *feel* like Spider-Man. 

Jokes aside, I agree. Other powers are fun for some of the missions (like Noir's for some Taskmaster stealth missions), but just playing around, Quips are essential. &&So May Porker, a radioactive pig, bit a spider, who turned into Spider-Ham, and was subsequently adopted by May, and May named the spider ""Peter Porker""?&&> Tasty Spider Totems...     

FTFY&&_Chugs whole glass of water_&&The spider was already named Peter, but yeah that's how he became Spider-Ham and got the last name Porker.

Scarlett Johansson Lands $15 Million Payday for Black Widow Movie,28714,9n9vdb,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/black-widow-movie-scarlett-johansson-lands-15-million-payday-1151328?__twitter_impression=true,3091,1539263759.0,,">Evans and Hemsworth nabbed that same $15 million payday for *Captain America: Civil War* and *Thor: Ragnarok*, respectively, as well as this year’s 'Avengers: Infinity War' and the upcoming fourth *Avengers* film.

> Chadwick Boseman nabbed a seven-figure ($2 million, according to sources) paycheck to star in *Black Panther.*  

> Brie Larson, whose Oscar win for 2015's *Room* figures into her deals, will be paid some $5 million for next year’s *Captain Marvel* movie (Larson landed a generous payday, but in exchange signed a seven-picture deal that locks her into multiple franchises.)

Edit: Brie Larson just \[[tweeted](https://twitter.com/brielarson/status/1050417232893890560)\] that it's not true that she signed a seven-picture deal that locks her into multiple franchises.&&Did Marvel announce a new lineup? I always figured this movie would happen but I didn't see an announcement or anything...&&Somewhere, Emily Blunt is reading this and thinking, ""fucking Gulliver's Travels...""&&movie is 5 years too* late, good for her on the paycheck though&&I dunno, I think they missed their window on this movie &&Taking an acting job from an actual black widow spider. Fuck you Hollywood.&&Maybe this makes me a bad Marvel fan or a bad woman, but I really have no interest in a Black Widow movie. Do I like Black Widow when she shows up in Avengers films? Sure? Do I miss her when she's not in them? Not really. I hope they pair her with someone more interesting.&&Fuck amp.

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-widow-movie-scarlett-johansson-lands-15-million-payday-1151328?__twitter_impression=true&&Meanwhile, I'm broke af.&&This should have been a phase 2 movie. Can honestly say I'm not interested in it any more, especially for phase 4. 
I thought we were going more cosmic with the new films now other than those who already have their franchise started?&&Is this part of the MCU timeline? I didn't see a Black Widow movie as part of anything post Phase 3.&&Does anybody else not really find Black Widow all that interesting of a character? I mean she has no super powers or abilities besides being decent at hand to hand combat and she basically never has any emotion in any of her films. I just don’t know how they could make a movie with her as the lead work.&&We better find out what happened in budapest&&Everyone here acting like we aren’t going to pay to see Johansson in tight black leather kicking ass for 2 hours...&&How is her salary relevant?  She was always one of the highest paid actors of the Avengers.  In Avengers: Age of Ultron, she was the second highest paid actor at $20 million, behind RDJ's $40 million payday.  Chris Evans was the third highest paid at $6.9 million.  She made almost 3 times what Evan's made, while at that point he had 2 solo Captain America movies and she had no starring roles or solo movies in any of the MCU movies.

I love Scarjo and am glad she has a Black Widow solo film.  But, she has never been a victim of any gender wage gap.  Actually,  if this is true,  then she needs to fire her agent for getting $5 million less for her own movie.&&Too late. Good on her for getting the payday, but the desire for this move has come and gone. People were begging for this movie a few years ago, but as we've seen more from her character, I think that many are ready to move on and see what's next for the Marvel Universe. I'm sure that whatever film we get will be good, but I'd rather see the time and effort put into something else, and I suspect that many feel the same way. &&Good for her. I hope it works out. I, however, have zero interest in a Black Widow movie. I don't even understand how she is an avenger. She has zero powers, zero personality, zero tension. Get ready for a generic super-spy movie with an MCU backdrop. &&Black Widow is such a Meh character. Anyone else...... &&Good for her. Make that money.&&[deleted]&&I will probably watch the movie but as others have said it just seems given where the story is heading this was a movie that should have been made years ago. 

It could be really cool if they go for a new style not really seen in the marvel cinematic universe. Like a serious spy drama. &&Get it while ya can you gorgeous babe.&&Pretty hard to get excited about a Spy movie, where we've seen half the life in the universe get erased.&&now shes resorting to stealing roles from arachnids, someone needs to put a stop to this&&everyone acting like they arent going to watch it lmao &&[deleted]&&Both Evans and Hemsworth got garbage (money) for their first franchise movies (sources vary, but it sounds like neither of them got more than six figures)...The only person in the first movies who got decent bank was RDJ, who signed on for a share of the gross, due to the funky way the first Iron Man was funded.&&I mean, yeah.

Sebastian Stan signed a 9 picture deal I believe. And Ruffalo signed a big deal, too.&&Don't forget you're here forever&&Anytime you read a story where it says an actor has been ""locked in"" to a multiple-picture deal, always keep in mind that Hollywood contracts are not like real contracts.

Any multi-picture deal is contingent on the success of each film, as well as the whims of the studio and film producers, and ultimately rests on getting the actor to agree to actually work in subsequent films, at a rate which gets re-negotiated with each film.

If Brie Larson gets $5 million for Captain Marvel and it turns into a blockbuster, then she demands some outrageous amount for the sequel, then she's out, and someone else is hired. Or, if the studio offers a pittance for the sequel, then maybe Brie is ""unavailable"", or just does the minimum required and no press tour and the sequel bombs. Everything is up for negotiation, and all deals can be broken.

There have been many deals made where the actor was supposed to get paid a huge amount, but ended up getting less. So they have to sue the studio, or maybe do nothing, in exchange for getting a better deal on another film.&&Boseman was relatively unknown before Black Panther, so I bet his paycheck is going to be much closer to this for the next movie. &&I'm surprised Chadwick Bosemans isn't higher, seems like sequels have a much bigger impact than just year of release.&&It's being held off until after Avengers 4 to avoid spoilers.&&[deleted]&&I’m sure Emily Blunt is making plenty of money from playing Mary Poppins.&&If they cast her and her hubby as Sue and Reed, it'll be worth it. &&I am inferring....she turned down Black Widow so that she could be in that disaster? Oh Emily...&&[But I think Emily Blunt would've portrayed Black Widow *far better in so many ways.](https://youtu.be/GNoQdKDZwHM?t=5)&&I'm still salty about this. I still love Scarletts BW cause she really owns the character now but Emily Blunt would have been dream casting for me&&somewhere she is counting her % gross share from a A Quiet Place.&&I'm pretty sure Emily Blunt is thinking about ""fucking Jack Ryan"" instead. &&Yeah I would have been so hyped for this back in 2010-2013. Now I don't know. I'll see anything MCU but this character has been in so many movies and we already know a fair bit about her that I don't really know how much a standalone spinoff can really bring to the table. Especially in a post-Thanos world.&&Honestly? Yeah. This movie would've been really good following Age of Ultron or even The Avengers but I'm hoping that Nick and Maria's appearances in Spiderman and Captain Marvel will set this one up nicely.&&I agree it should have been done a long time ago, but there’s also no reason why it won’t work now. &&Finally! Now we'll get to see all those infamous Black Widow villains like......uh.....and all those beloved Black Widow supporting characters like.....um...er...

shit I got nothing, guys.&&If they go James Bond vibe I’m in. &&You can blame Ike Perlmutter for the delay. When he was CEO he denied Fiege any Black Widow and Black Panther movies he wanted to make. He was also the main force behind the Inhumans push that crashed and burned. 

Now that Fiege has more control, BP make bank, and IW was insaine, he can get a Black Widow green lit by disney with ease.&&Yeah, most of us wanting more women led super hero movies only hoped for Black Widow because she was at the time our best bet. Now with Captain Marvel and TWO Wonder Women movies, Black Widow needs to be **really** good. A Black Widow movie isn't needed like it use to be. Frankly the only spider gal I want is Spider-Gwen.

That being said they can make it work, go for a more James Bond angle and they can strike gold.&&*Too&&I agree. Her character is so... quaint in the new marvel context. She was very popular for a while, but it feels like marvel had moved on with new characters and she's past her peak of popularity.&&I think you mean they missed their widow on this movie.&&They really did. I used to be on Tumblr in like 2012/13 and people on there were absolutely ITCHING for a Black Widow movie.

People were outlining possible plots, which characters would fit in nice, the tone, etc. But that was running off the first Avengers hype. 

I think shortly after Winter Soldier would have been the perfect time to release a stand alone movie, since she played such an integral role in that film. But now it feels like the opportunity has passed. &&It's a movie about Scarlett Johansson bouncing around in a tight suit. It's never too late&&It's late but if they get the tone right remember she is a super-spy first and an action hero second, it could be something really different. &&[deleted]&&She only has the four limbs! What are they going to do for the other 4? CGI? Prosthetics? Where does it end!?&&Watch Infinity War again. At no point does anyone talk to Black Widow, nor does she say anything that makes an impact. She could be completely removed from the film, and you wouldn't notice.

It's kind of hilarious.&&I’m holding out for a Black Widow/Winter Soldier arc myself.&&I don't think it does. She's been a great support character, and I sympathize with those that would rather see her be a co-pilot in the story just like she was in Winter Soldier.&&Why on earth would this opinion make you a bad woman? &&Same boat as you. I would only be interested if this was before the Avengers and during the cold war/spying days. Toss in Bucky or Clint and it'll be a fantastic movie.

But a Post-Infinity War Black Widow movie sounds pretty boring to me.&&Honestly I think a Black Widow movie could hypothetically be good but not with the way they've established the character and not with Scarlett Johansson, for all her starpower the reality is that she's kind of a niche actor who can only do well in very specific roles and this isn't one of them. Also it'll really only work if they make a complete tonal shift from everything the MCU has done so far, Winter Soldier is the closest they've gotten to the right tone for a Black Widow movie and it still doesn't go nearly far enough.

They won't do this because they're not DC but I honestly think it would be better to get a different actor and do a Black Widow tv show.&&Fuck Twitter.

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-widow-movie-scarlett-johansson-lands-15-million-payday-1151328&&Clearly you should have explored being Scarlett Johansson as a career path.&&I'm sitting in a MCds eating dollar menu food that I paid for with quarters. I want to kill myself.&&Do you look like Scar Jo?&&Yes nothing against Scarlett or making money. I understand supply and demand but actors and footballers making so much money is almost gross. When is enough enough?&&I hope it's not all cosmic.  I really dig more earthbound stuff.&&Still waiting on a proper Hulk installment.&&yes. it could be a prequel&&I read that they won't announce movies in advance like that anymore because it spoils too much.&&Stoic hand to hand fighter with no super powers and an array of gadgets? Sounds a little bat-ty to me&&Imo they should be working on Mariah Hill or Silver Sable if they want to push a strong female character in the MCU. Johanssom is more marketable though.&&She’s one of the least interesting characters.  &&In all honesty it just needs to be a cool spy movie. It can't have the same type of action or story as the regular MCU movies, it needs to be something almost completely different than what we are used to for it to be good, and I imagine that won't go over well with fans of the MCU. I expect it to do alright, but not great, but also might appeal to more people, like those weirdos that thought Lucy becoming a damn flash drive was good writing. &&You and I remember Budapest very differently. &&to be fair, if that was all it took, Ghost in a Shell would've made far more money. But we will when the Marvel logo is attached to the movie. They've proven that they make good movies so we can trust them. &&Or the accompanying heroes and villain(s) that will be in it with her. Marvel is smart and knows how to build seat-selling casts theses days. People see Black Widow movie and I guess assume that it's all Black Widow. I see Black Widow movie and get excited wondering what characters they'll pair her with to make it enticing.&&Eeehhhh ... we've had plenty of that over the years. Black Widow just isn't particularly interesting. You kind of need an interesting character to lead a good movie.&&> Everyone here acting like we aren’t going to pay to see ~~Johansson~~ her stunt double in tight black leather kicking ass for 2 hours...&&I feel for Chris Evans. He deserves to be paid more.&&She was great at first, but I think the biggest harm they've done to the character is the way they handled all the romantic pairings.

Avengers: Here's this Hawkeye dude and he and Widow are super close, maybe lovers?

Winter Soldier: Let's have Widow flirt and kiss Cap, that'll get the people going. 😘

Age of Ultron: Okay, let's establish that Widow has a 100% platonic relationship with Cap and Hawkeye but now she's in love with Hulk and can calm him down for some reason.

Infinity War: yeah that whole Hulk/Widow thing was dumb, let's just ignore it. &&She was also in Iron Man 2.

But honestly, I just do not care enough about her character to be excited about a solo movie.&&Lucy made 440 million, so... yeah, prolly. It's not like they're casting her in Ghost in the Shell.

As for the unprofitable question, Captain America: First Avenger barely turned a profit and made about as much money as Justice League after marketing (weird to think that Justice League and Captain America made about the same money in the end). The MCU was about 50/50 right out of the gate.&&I found Ant Man pretty boring actually i'm really excited for this Black Widow movie!&&I can see her aging gracefully and remaining prominent in serious roles. Maybe like a Charlize Theron. &&The difference here is that this will still be a superhero movie so unlike Red Sparrow there will be a lot more action sequences and fight scenes.

And Atomic Blonde is a spy movie centered around a woman and that movie was fucking rad.&&Atomic Blonde more than tripled its budget.

Spy quadrupled its budget.

Salt tripled its budget.

Charlie's Angels quadrupled its budget.

And Red Sparrow, believe it or not, was actually a meager success after its marketing is considered. It's nowhere near the myth-building that pretends the 1998 Godzilla movie was a bomb instead, but the early claims that the movie wouldn't turn a profit never panned out.&&> Spy films centered on women aren't usually successful

This is the same old bullshit that told us that female-led superhero movies weren't successful until Wonder Woman or that asian led comedies wouldn't be successful but then Crazy Rich Asians happened. 

Maybe the reason why spy films centered on women aren't successful is because no one's made an actually good one and gave it the marketing it deserved? &&Red Sparrow didn't have a well-established MCU character in the lead role though&&The film Lucy made alot of money.&&I know a lot of people don't like Melissa McCarthy, but Spy made like 200+ million on a 65million dollar budget. Granted, it was a comedy, but it was still about a handler becoming a field agent spy. &&And even RDJ was getting less than Terrance Howard on the first one.&&But those were the origins of those characters, and I don’t recall either being a huge name before then, so that’s probably why. Scar Jo was already a household name before Avengers, and by this point BW is a well established character, if lacking in backstory (until this movie comes out)&&I still remember when Jim Carrey got 20 million.&&I mean I'd gladly take that garbage if they don't want it &&They signed on when Marvel was an independent studio deep in debt. They lowballed everyone. Almost lost Sam Jackson and Mickey Rourke and Jon Favreau from Iron Man too. With reports of them offering just double the SAG minimum for starring roles. (Something like $250k)&&That's after marvel learned that you had to lock people in or else you're forced to pay people per movie like Robert Downey junior making 50+ million per movie since he has percentage of gross. &&Ruffalo actually signed the same deal as the other phase 1 actors, for 6 films. He’s just going to be around for one more after them because he doesn’t have his own franchise to use up his appearances.

Here’s a source: http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/marvel/249346/marvel-studios-when-actors-contract-expire&&Only 5 more for Bucky after IW2, I can see it&&Do it for her!&&We already kind of have an idea of what's happening next anyway.

Spider-Man 2, Black Widow, probably Strange 2 and Black Panther 2. Who knows what's going on with Guardians though.&&You joke, but there's a ridiculously devoted batch of crazies who have seething hate for Emily Blunt solely for the fact that she isn't Jenna Fischer.

It's fucking sad when people can't distinguish reality from fiction.&&Once she's integrated into the MCU the bucks will rain down.

You'd watch Mary Poppins vs. Thanos. Don't lie, you know you would.&&[deleted]&&I'm Mary Poppins Ya'll&&More than worth it, because marvel will want those characters around for at least a decade, hopefully more &&God I want this so bad. They'd be perfect.&&That is a FANTASTIC idea!!  They would be perfect.&&Might happen, I think. Reportedly Krasinski was close to getting Captain America (even did a screen test with the costume on) and they starred together in A Quiet Place (which Krasinski directed), so that shows that A) Marvel likes Krasinski and B) they can work together as a couple on film.

Make it happen, Feige!&&Only ""issue"" with that is Reed Richards isn't mean't to be that likeable; he's an arrogant egomaniac. Krasinski seems too nice to be like that. But if they got them I'm sure they could make it work&&Is this even on the table? Who's working on a FF movie?&&I think it was more a contract issue since she already signed on for that movie. Unfortunate timing.&&Emily Blunt turned out just fine. I love her work. Scarlett's paid well but isn't that exciting of an actress.&&She was forced by Fox.&&She kicked ass so hard in Edge of Tomorrow it was basically one big screen test for Black Widow.&&I honestly haven't seen anything redeeming from Johansson in the Marvel franchise other than bringing a famous name.&&Well for starters she can act way better than Scarlett Johansson.&&Classy. I bet if she was playing Black Widow, this solo movie would've came out by now.&&I would love to see another winter soldier, spy like movie. They could integrate more of her past in it as well. &&I didn't really see the point in a third Thor movie but damn if I wasn't proven wrong. &&That’s why I’m hoping it’s a post-A4 movie, unless it’s been confirmed it’ll be an origin story. Maybe it’ll be a bit of both? &&My guess is the movie will probably be a prequel to show her events leading up to her being recruited by Shield.&&and also, i dont really want to see how they explain away her russian heritage and accent (i remember they mention it as a throwaway in one of the other films). ScarJo with a bad russian accent is not at the top of things i need to see. If they make it some kind of sequel, set after IW, i might be interested where she reckons with her past (and we get the origin told in flashbacks), i might be interested&&This absolutely should have followed Age of Ultron.&&[deleted]&&I want to say, they could effectively do something like a Jason Bourne/John Wick/Atomic Blonde...  the villain can just be any made up Hyrdra higher up, who hires assassins to kill her.

I'm sure that would be a little risky for Marvel, but could work. Then again, I don't see that working in the Disney MCU as well as it does for those other movies mentioned.&&Let's not act like anyone gave a shit about Iron Monger, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, Malekith, Killmonger, Darren Cross, Alexander Pierce, or Aldrich Killian before their respective movies. Marvel makes money from nothing. 
&&Marvel managed to make a talking racoon and a barely talking tree into memorable characters. I have no doubt that that they could pit her against a surly 7-11 cashier and get it to work.&&> Finally! Now we'll get to see all those infamous Black Widow villains like...

* Sofia and Yelena Belova (the other Black Widows)
* Black Lotus
* Bengal
* Mr. X
* Beetle
* General Yuri Brushnov

And don't forget Black Widow has had some conflict with big names like Elektra, Bullseye and Loki!

Lots of options for the villains of a Black Widow movie...  My guess is that it will involve the other Black Widows though.&&Imagine: Black Widow has to take down a bad guy, played by Daniel Craig. He's British and has cool shit.

Think ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" but modern, reversed gender roles and an actual decent villain. &&>Frankly the only spider gal I want is Spider-Gwen.

According to Sony, you are most likely not alone. She's been a big character in the marketing for Spider-Verse.&&Most people are kind of blah on Black Widow around here but I actually loved off her akido and gadget based fight scenes more than the crazy super power fights.

Although in IW it sure seemed like she'd gotten a power upgrade off camera.&&I don't know ... in the face of massive universe shattering powers, a little skulduggery might just be the right approach.

You can't beat Thanos in a straight punch-up.  The team on Titan got pretty close, and Thor got a good sucker-punch in there at the end... but that strategy didn't really pan out for them overall. 

Plus, Winter Soldier was still my favorite MCU flick.  A little cloak and dagger is a nice change of pace to contrast all of the bombast in most MCU movies.



&&Her back story is what they need to focus on. The red room, her relationship with Bucky, and how she defected from the KGB. &&She's like a Defenders tier side character hanging with galactic super-badasses. She'd be more interesting if they'd leaned more into the manipulative/mistrusted angle, but they just made her a standard kung foo white hat with no super powers. Hawkeye is technically more intersting even because he at least has a ""thing"", even if its kinda lame.&&aaaaaayyyyy&&OP missed his widow too&&If I know anything about myself...it’s that my brain would still want to smash.&&There are [dozens of them](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/9/97/Possession_Blackarachnia_slags_Starscream.jpg/280px-Possession_Blackarachnia_slags_Starscream.jpg)&&Well, that's what I get for expecting Asia Argentino at the other end of that link...&&[Or..](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ttVJtsc5Ka7jHsDsps8cFbMHhbA/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/10/06/866/n/1922283/af5687756dc05e98_MSDJAAN_EC033_H/i/Miss-Spider-From-James-Giant-Peach.JPG)&&[deleted]&&Why does she have human knees?&&Is this like a spider bowsette or something &&Literally the only lines I remember her saying were

""Hi Bruce""

And

""Gross""

I honestly think those were her only lines.&&Bruce says ""hey Nat""&&Well you could say the same about hawkeye&&She had 6 lines.&&Right. 

I am saying this as a HUGE Scarlett and black widow fan. 

Everything she does in IW, dare I say it, is cringey. I rewatched again today and when she, cap and BP go to the forcefield to speak to proxima it's like, ""Why is she there""? she's not going to be able to threaten her.

It really feels to me like that was an agent move so that her character was involved at all times. 

Also, thanos'' reaction to her running up to attack him at the end was OVERKILL. 

Did she need to be encased in a tree? No. Could he have dispatched her in another more conventional way? Yes, definitely. He could've blown her away. 

I still would like to see a black widow movie with Scarlett but I can't see it doing *that* well.&&She was definitely just there because she needed to be somewhere and she's going to have a more major role in A4.&&That might be good. But if the movie is just about her, I'm not super interested.&&Apparently if a movie has a female lead then you HAVE to be excited for it. Otherwise that makes you sexist. &&Step 1: Be hot&&If I would be a male stripper (I am not a male stripper, or am I) then Scarlett Brohansson would be my stage name. In fact, Scarlett Brohansson *is* my stage name, but I am not a male stripper.&&I’ll explore Scarlett Johansson as a career path. Edit. Just kidding baby. &&should have accepted that role as the older sister in the 3rd Home Alone movie like she did. 

Gotta make moves when you're young.&&Seriously.... This world is so bizzare, the amount of money and stardom give to a select few while everyone else suffers. &&> Do you look like Scar Jo?

If you have been drinking heavily and squint a bit, I sorta resemble an ugly Jon Favreau, which is pretty much the same thing, right?
&&Batman would be boring as hell without his backstory and motif though.&&Sony is making a Silver Sable movie.&&So she was just a romantic interest for all the other members of the team because she was the sole woman?

Of course, that's not the case anymore, but it was awkward to notice back then. Didn't make her character very justified aside from the skills and strategy she brought to the team.&&Maybe I am in the minority, but I thought it was pretty clear in Winter Soldier that Nat and Steve were completely platonic.  There is no romantic subtext in that movie and they even discuss him dating Sharon.  At most, that perception is just an extension of society's inability to recognize platonic male/female relationships.

In Avengers, on the other hand, I agree that they pulled a bait-and-switch with Nat and Clint.&&Black Widow is also pretty bland as far as superpower go too. Though it'd be interesting if they took a bit of a risk and made it more along the lines of a James Bonds/The Man from U.N.C.L.E. movie given her spy roots.&&If people couldn't get excited about a Solo movie, I doubt they'll be excited about this solo movie. &&[deleted]&&Theron's bone structure will lead to better aging though. All about the bone structure, dawg.&&Charlize Theron isn't old though....&&Atomic Blonde was way more awesome than I thought it would be from the trailers. If I had a penis, it probably would have been hard through half of the fight sequences. &&Atomic blonde had amazing style, but the plot was weak. I suspect that’s why you’re describing it as “rad” a perfect word to use in a film that is certainly style over substance.&&I was gonna say, that comment was pretty self-fulfilling nonsense&&Though RDJ got the last laugh there&&""Next time, baby.""&&RDJ was a huge risk for relapse at the time.&&Agreed. I'm more pointing it out in reference to Larsen and Boseman getting smaller payouts.

ScarJo should definitely be making ""Established Main Character"" money for her solo movie.&&RDJ was most definitely a known name, although not necessarily for the right reasons.
&&there wouldn't be MCU (as we know it) if Iron Man failed. 

Favreau RDJ Feige are all in for the success that made MCU even possible to begin with. Not to mention that RDJ wasn't seen as reliable as today, so having his paycheck tied to the picture, certainly helped keep everyone's nerves at bay.&&What a god.&&[deleted]&&It's pretty clear that whatever they're paying RDJ, they think it's worth it. Sure, he had to be in the Iron Man movies, and it's pretty important he's in the Avengers movies. But on top of that they decided to make him a second lead in both Spiderman and Cap 3 - they reckon they're getting their money's worth.&&How did they lock Stan Lee into an appearance in every movie?&&So that means he's safe in whatever the events of Infinity War Two is? 

6 Film deal, he was in: Avengers 1, Avengers 2, Ragnarok, Infinity War. So he's got two left? 
&&They tried, but ultimately it all gets out eventually. Now pretty much every detail of Phase 4 is out there, just a matter of when rather than what.

Saying that, it's saved them on Guardians 3.&&Spiderman was supposed to kick off the new Chapter, and Guardians was supposed to set up the arc, but I don't know what's going to happen, now.

I think Disney shot themselves in the foot by standing their ground on the decision against Gunn. They'll probably kill off Drax now, for all I know. &&And there are rumors of an eternals movie as well.&&Also Eternals and possibly Dark Avengers&&[deleted]&&Wait, is she supposed to be Jenna Fisher? I feel like I missed a step&&But Mary Poppins died in GotG2. &&I'd play that video game&&Why would Yondu fight Thanos, he dead&&MP would utterly fuck up Thanos.&&Problem: those movies come out in 3-5 years most likely. At which point, those two will be around 40 years old. I highly doubt Marvel will cast two people that old to play those characters, even if they age as well as those two will.&&Say that again...&&And Johnny Storm can be played by Chris Evans again!&&i actually think Krasinski would have been an excellent Cap, but I can't help but see him as Jim. It's partially his voice, it's very distinctive to me. 

But either way, I would kill to see him and Blunt as Reed and Sue. &&Don't forget he also co-write A Quiet Place so he's a triple threat. Here's a sample of the script:

[SCENE: EXTERIOR]

DAD: ...

MOM: ...

DAUGHTER: ...
&&I mean, Tony Stark was kind of a dick in the comics, too. They made him a lot more likable in the movies. &&Jim is kind of an arrogant egomaniac too, honestly.&&Once the Fox deal is finalized, X-Men and FF are priorities for Marvel Studios. &&That is super unfortunate.

I remember that being the first year CBS allowed for the most blatant shilling on Survivor. One tribe had just won the reward challenge! What will they get?! More bedding? More tarp? Maybe a spa day? NOPE! 

CBS INVITES U TO A SPECIAL BEACH THEATER TO ENJOY AN EXCLUSIVE SCREENING OF THE NEW HIT COMEDY 'GULLIVER'S TRAVELS'!, IN THEATERS SOON!

Cue staged shots of the tribe members eating popcorn and killing themselves laughing interspersed with brief shots of what looked like a terribly unfunny, pathetic movie. Yikes.&&Agreed, Emily still has the more interesting career&&Edge of Tomorrow is amazing, but it also came out 4 years after Black Widow's first appearance in the MCU.&&That tone with Hawkeye and falcon would work really really well.

&&I thought Winter Soldier did the Bourne style of action spy movie well, but I'd like to see Black Widow lean more into Bond. 

Exotic locales, stylish cars/clothes, hot dudes for BW to discard/double cross, and all that jazz&&I believe the movie is supposed to be pre avengers but I'm not sure. &&Widow, Falcon, Cap in the time between CW and IW. I feel like those 3 were up to some cool shit. &&I was thinking about this the other day, and I don't know that Thor Ragnarok would have worked without the earlier movies setting the stage for it's ridiculousness. If you destroy something that the audience isn't at sort of familiar with, it's destruction will be muted. And the first two Thor movies had more a grounding on Earth, with forays to the other realms being jaunts. In TR, most of the movie takes place in alien locales that I think would have been harder to buy into without having built up the background first.&&it could be a contained, side-movie, a spy thrillers.

she's a human, so I guess there can't be a super villain. She doesnt have superpowers&&If you're being raised as a spy from the very young age she was, it's possible she could've never had much of an  accent to begin with if they properly trained Western diction from age 4 or so onward. She was brought up in the Red Room, right, which took in orphans to train to specifically infiltrate the West.&&I disagree. A follow up to Winter Soldier would've been awesome. At the end of that one Steve and Natasha head their own ways and it would've been a cool solo film before the Avengers reunite in Age of Ultron. &&Honestly I like Ant-Man alright but that would have been way cooler. &&Hulk is the best example.

(Most) All his villains are other hulks with a bit more evil flair.&&Red Sparrow. &&Villain is the wrong word, she needs an antagonist.

Hawk Guy.

Have the two of them be competing spies or wet work specialists, they develop grudging respect, then she saves his life or refuses to kill him so has to go to shield when they (Russian Hydra) go after her.  

I mean it pretty much writes itself.&&Blonde Widow. I forget her name. Starts with a Y. Second idea: She gets betrayed by Russian Intelligence after failing a mission and has to kill the guys trying to kill her and is recruited by the man she failed to kill, Hawkeye.&&I wonder how many times Marvel has to make a hit movie out of C to Z-list comic characters before people stop attempting to act like ""who are these characters lol"" is a relevant point.&&People liked Killmonger a lot. &&The people's champion, taking down the rude cashier for all of us. &&Not a good comparison. The Guardians universe has a ton of established characters and storylines in it.&&Tell me more about Beetle. &&Not surprised. I was excited at Spider-Verse anyway, then when they announced Spider-Gwen I lost my fucking mind/my hype went through the roof. I'd watch a Spider-Gwen solo movie&&i just realized something, cant they just start their sony universe with spider gwen?&&Except they haven't used her as anything spylike or manipulatively since Iron Man 2. She just kicks people now.&&Agree. And even in the cosmic context, sometimes a little subterfuge is exactly the right play. The way to win in the face of overwhelming odds is to cheat. 

I remember reading scene in a book once where one mage defeats another, much more powerful wizard, because the powerful wizard was expecting a head-on fight and the mage palmed something: a common sleight-of-hand trick defeated overwhelming raw power.&&winter soldier does kick ass.  definitely top 5&&From Saga, [the Stalk NSFW](https://m.imgur.com/12ClW).&&[deleted]&&“We don’t want to kill you, but we will”&&Lots of people liked her moment with Scarlet Witch and Okoye.

As far as DC goes though I *would* like to see a Hawkgirl movie because she's got a dope kit.&&\#Ghostbusters2016&&feminists: women can do whatever they want

Marvel doesn’t. &&Add Jeremy Renner and we've got a recipe for a good time &&Right. I think the only real dip since the first Avengers was Ant-Man and the Wasp, and that wasn't entirely bad considering the timing after IW and Paul Rudd's track record. Still a hit, but a small one compared to the recent history.&&She's 43. In actress years, that's like 85.&&she's not young anymore, either &&I didn't mind the plot, it was a pretty standard plot really, spy fools everyone because she's a badass spy.&&I saw an ad for some tv show that Howard is apparently in. I haven't thought about that guy since Iron Man 2.&&I liked Howard in that role and wanted to see him as War Machine. I think Don Cheadle is great but it's a what if for me. &&Yes and no. He was clean then, but hadnt had a chance to prove it yet. His past weighed him down. &&True. But it sounds like Larsen has the chance and opted for the multi movie deal, and Boseman wasn’t that established either, AFAIK. Just the appearance in CW, so I’d say his pay makes sense. &&Look how much the cast of Star Wars makes. In the first episode of the newer trilogy. They made Disney so much money but other than Han Solo, the rest didn’t make that much. Daisy and John made less than a mil the first movie.

I read ages ago about their shitting on all the creatives that help them make millions too.   


Disney doesn't care for anything thats not executive salaries &&Not necessarily. I think it’s up to marvel if they want to use his full contract. But yeah, I highly doubt they’ll kill him off in part 2. &&He's... the Hulk.

He didn't get snapped, which means good luck actually trying to kill him off.&&It just means marvel can use him 1 more time. Doesn't matter if he's alive or dead. Aaron Taylor Johnson had a 2 film contract and he died in the first movie he was in. &&>They'll probably kill off Drax now, for all I know.

You can't kill what you can't see.&&Firing Gunn shoots Disney in foot.&&Those aren't rumors anymore! The already confirmed the director! &&Right yes! I forgot about that one!&&Let's have a double date. My wife will pay. I mean she did just get a $15 million paycheck today.&&Jimothy?&&She is married to John krazinsky who played jim halpert in the office who was married to Pam Beasley played by Jenna Fischer. Although I didn't get why people hate her?&&I can't believe you've done this&&He may have been your father, boy.  
But he wasn't your daddy.&&It took me a second to realize what you meant. But now I'm crying. &&They can pass as 30-something, which I think is the general age for Sue and Reed.&&Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) was 40 when they cast him. &&Paul Rudd is 40-fucking-9 years old. 

They can make it work. &&Why, though? Reed and Sue are not Spider-Man. They can be older. And their action scenes would be mainly CGI anyway so it's not like they'd have to be in peak shape. &&FANTA5TIC 4OUR &&You must be talking about when they sent them to watch Jack and Jill with Adam Sandler....

If you ever happen to watch that scene again. Watch Sophies face. You can tell she'd rather be sitting in the pissing rain, eaiting a scoop of rice; Than be in that theatre.&&You mean [Jack and Jill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC1Y0qT9X9Q)? The woman in purple hates her life watching it even though they got all that food. It's a horrible movie&&Still not as bad as when they had to watch that Adam Sandler movie Jack and Jill or whatever it was.

And then the castaways had to wax poetic about how great it all was, like they really enjoyed the movie.&&Nothing against Emily Blunt, but dig a little deeper into ScarJo's catalog. She's got some weird, fun stuff in there. &&Falcon would likely still be in the military and not shield. But having hawkeye trying to bring in a defecting widow with the winter soldier being rented out to the kgb from hydra ops would be dope. &&I actually would like a movie with the smaller heroes of the MCU. A Hawkeye/Widow/Falcon movie would be pretty cool. It could be a cool little espionage movie. Maybe even add Banner, but without Hulk. It could focus more on the SHIELD aspect of the universe. &&Did you read tales of suspense right after the hydra cap thing? It was Hawkeye and bucky tracking down what seemed like mysterious appearances of the deceased black widow

Their dynamic together was so great. They could definitely recreate it in the movies. &&""My name is Penis... Penis Galore""

&&That would make the most sense to me, or split between current times and flashbacks. I believe hawkeye bringing her in back in her KGB days will be central to the story.  Maybe even introduce crimson dynamo? &&It sounds cool on paper, but I feel it would be more like just a prequel to Cap's beard.&&Or someone coming after Widow for leaking all that info back in WS&&Thor rag was so good because we finally got to experience him become the god of thunder.&&I don't think that's true. Guardians of the Galaxy takes place almost entirely on alien worlds and did really well. 

No one expected anything from Thor 3 because the first two Thor movies suck. The studio tried a different approach and it worked. It's not the alien setting that put Thor 3 apart from the other Thors, it's the tone and the humor. &&Batman's a human who fights super villains. Powers aren't necessary.&&Sounds like how they did it on The Americans. Soviet spies who weren't allowed to speak a word of Russian the moment they arrived in the USA. Show is set 20years after they arrived, so their good English and meh Russian pronunciation made sense in the story.&&[deleted]&&Yelena Bel....ova...? &&I agree, Only a handful of villains are really iconic and most of them belong to Spider-Man, Batman, or The Flash. Most heroes have maybe one villain of their own that people recognize. I'd like to see some other villains start getting reoccurring roles like Baron Zemo though. &&Not before he was in the movie. He was a pretty C-list or even D-list Marvel character in the comics. Of course, now he's getting his own series, but my point is that Marvel doesn't need big name characters for their movies. They *make* any character into a big name character.&&Your Friendly Neighborhood Super Spy. Black Widow working with Spider-Man and giving out total over-the-top ass kickings to regular criminals while Spidey tries to reign her in would be tremendous. &&Unlike /u/GreenFootball I'll try giving you an actual answer. There are actually three different villains who have taken up the mantle of the Beetle, all remaining C-listers or B-listers at best.

The first and most popular Beetle was a a mechanic name [Abner Jenkins](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/3/3a/Abner_Jenkins_%28Earth-616%29_from_Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe_Master_Edition_Vol_1_18_0001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100622225959) who build a mechanized suit to make money as a supervillain. He had numerous run ins with various superheroes, mostly the Fantastic Four and especially Spider-man, but he occasionally fought against Iron Man and the Avengers. He later went on to reform and become the superhero Mach-X after his stint with the superhero team the Thunderbolts (sort of like Marvel's suicide squad, but not really).

The second and shortest term Beetle was a woman named [Leila Davis](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/d/dd/Leila_Davis_%28Earth-616%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20130621223121). She made a suit of armor to get revenge on the 1st Beetle for presumably killing her husband. She was in a few different supervillain groups before getting killed.

The third Beetle, and the one that could probably work is [Janice Lincoln](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/c/c8/The_Superior_Foes_of_Spider-Man_Vol_1_6_Textless.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130817065758), the daughter of Spider-man villain Tombstone. She decided that she wanted a more exciting life, so she used her father's connections to get a suit, and so she took up the name of the Beetle. She fought several times against Black Widow and Bucky Barnes during his tenure as Captain America (when Steve Rogers was dead/actually time traveling).

The only link between all is that they're all villains who used a high tech beetle suits with flight, lasers, some super strength, and a bunch of gadgets.&&All the more reason to get her back into her element.  The MCU has plenty of people that are really good at kicking people.  We should let her character do what she's really good at.

And she was definitely doing spy stuff in Winter Soldier, along with a lot of kicking people.&&>She just kicks people now

when i think of black widow i think of twirling leg neck choke... stuff.&&I knew it&&I'm such a Saga fanboy.&&""Where's your friend?""&&I'd enjoy a hawkeye black widow team up movie and split the amount of screen time for them down the middle like ant man and wasp&&Man's not hot.&&[This](https://imgur.com/a/twv2mAf) is what would have happened if he was there&&3. Get auditioned for a disney tv show when you're 15. &&Not until one of us decides to run for office, and I’m not joking. This government of clueless geriatrics do not represent the needs of my people. &&I dunno, an *ugly* Jon Favreau? *Yikes*.&&At the risk of tooting my own horn, yes, I actually can.  I love to cook and 'fancy' grilled cheeses and soups are the traditional post-Christmas Eve service dinner I do for friends and family.  My personal favorites are Brie cheese and pear with balsamic on brioche and chorizo, cheddar, and smoked gouda on sourdough, which I grill, cool, and then dip in beer batter and give a quick fry before serving.&&It's been mostly absent from all films as far as I can tell. The Nolan movies at least had him doing a little forensics but he's out-detectived by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Robin in TDKR. &&Clearly, you haven't seen the masterpiece, Batman: The Movie from 1968, in which Adam West solves the Riddler's many riddles, such as: ""what's yellow and writes?""

The answer is ""a ballpoint banana.""

No, this does not make any more sense in the context of the movie.

Yes, it is the best Batman movie ever made.&&Tell me , can we trust Harvey Dent?&&Ehh Spidey can compete in that department fine&&It'll be his Bourne movie he never had. &&It also made like 100 mil.more than the 1st one. That's pretty damn good for fucking ant-man &&The dude is legit nuts.  He truly believes that 1 * 1 = 2.  He's got his own fucked up math system called Terryology.  &&Probably Empire?&&Empire, I think it's winning awards and is going on season 5.&&Empire? It’s pretty fucking popular!&&Yep. Me too.

Can't blame him for wanting more money, and I can't blame Marvel for moving on.

Still, he had the swag that mirrored Tony perfectly. Cheadle is a better foil, but he lacks that swagger. &&Yeh I loved his Rhodey. Waaaay better then Cheadle and I love Cheadle. &&> Yes and no. He was clean then, *but hadnt had a chance to prove it yet*. His past weighed him down.

Sooo, then... yes. Yes he was a risk.&&He had chances to prove it in Ally McBeal etc. and he lapsed again and went off the rails. That was after he supposedly got clean.&&No, I totally agree. They're both being paid much more than anyone else was paid in the early days of the MCU, because even though the actors aren't that established, the movies are very much so.&&Larsen tweeted out that the 7 picture deal is not true but didn't further specify.&&[deleted]&&Why would they be paid more? Daisy and John weren't that widely known before the Star Wars. The studios usually prefer to hire younger, aspiring actors and make stars out of them. That also allows the studio to pay them less, since they aren't famous. Not to mention that  *""less than a mil""* doesn't really count as not earning much. It's a shitload of money for a single person and the rest of the crew make way less.

It doesn't really matter how much the studio makes from the movies. I mean, you don't see large retail companies paying their cleaners and shop assisstants higher wages then other companies? Why would Disney pay Daisy and John millions of dollars for their first Star Wars movie? It's not like they were irreplaceable like RDj or had unique acting skills.&&Not to get into a whole thing, but comic hulk is actually fucking impossible to kill (dependant on his level of rage, but still)

The bastard has regenerated from being turned into DUST for god's sake&&Hugo Weaving had a multi film contract as well. And they didn't even use him as the red skull in avengers 3&&Best way is to do a similar scene like in Avengers where he says, ""I can take it"", but he knows that he won't come back and he ends up purposely sacrificing himself for his new ""family"", now that his purpose to defeat Thanos is coming to fruition. &&You can’t kill what doesn’t show up for work&&Variety says you're hired.&&[deleted]&&The fuck is wrong with people?&&aww fuck&&I will never be able to read this sentence and not hear that guys voice&&He may have been your father, boy.

But he wasn't your nanny.&&Right now they can, but what about in a decade?&&Black don't crack.&&Holy SHIT [this is hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC1Y0qT9X9Q). That one woman in purple just hates her life while getting a break from hell living outside. This is gold. IDK how it only has like, 900 views&&Haha yeah they did it twice!&&Yeah ""Her"" isn't a perfect movie but any means but you can't say it isn't an unusual and interesting role for Scarlett.&&I mentioned hawk eye because of avengers mightiest hero cartoon,  and comics they have some great shield stories&&Mustafa Schlong&&Hung Lo, at your service...&&Yes, I want this exactly. &&How old is Natasha supposed to be? Scarlett Johansson is 33 and that feels about right for Black Widow. The USSR dissolved in 1991, when ScarJo/Natasha would have been six years old. Unless they have some weird explanation for how she doesn't age or they introduce some weird soviet splinter faction that operates well past the dissolution of the USSR, I don't know how they'll explain the timeline.&&Well, it was the best part of IW...  
It would lack in scope to be sure, I imagine they'd be doing some dark ops. But I think it could work as a tight spy thriller type. We already know the stakes are never real anyway.&&\*ahem\* I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers - was that sparkles?&&...I don't know about that. I think it was good because they completely abandoned the notion of trying to act serious like they did in the first 2 movies, mad max style. So instead of a mediocre drama (at best) like dark elves, we got an action/comedy flick, which is really the direction thor should have gone in the first place. &&Chris Hemsworth has charisma for days and Taiki finally utilized it correctly which is a big part of why it's so successful. That being said, I'm optimistic about the Black Widow movie. I think they'll do the character justice, plus I actually miss seeing Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. There could be some really good development between the two.&&Yeah, but it has ""Galaxy"" in the title so even if you didn't know anything else about the GotG lore, you'd know that space was probably involved. It's also not like GotG came out of, ahem, a vacuum as it was 10th MCU movie released, while Thor was the 4th, so I think there was more precedent set in the world-building canon. That said, GotG did a lot to establish the cosmic end of the MCU.&&> Batman's a human who fights super villains. Powers aren't necessary.

Batman's super power is money.&&Loki at least operates completely differently. Loki's an illusionist vs Thor's hammer+lightning. It's only a mirror match if Thor regularly fights a bruiser with elemental powers and a big weapon.&&[deleted]&&Mmm I'll give Thor a pass, Loki is a vastly different character and his opposite in every way. Their conflict is way more nuanced than the others as well.&&Spiderman really has the best marvel villain. He has probably the second biggest noticeable roster besides batman. Too bad venom sucked.&&So very true.  Even Superman and Wonder Woman are very limited in terms of ""recognized"" villains.  

Most Marvel characters?  They got nothin'.  I mean, in the comics they have recurring nemeses, sure, but nobody knows who they are outside MAYBE their ""arch-enemy.""

It doesn't help when you factor in that it's gotten a lot more blurry due to various media shuffling villains around (How many Batman villains has Ollie fought on ""Arrow"" now?  Or Superman villains for Kara on ""Supergirl?""), or for some characters that end up transcending their roots and becoming kind of ""villains for all"" (see: Deathstroke, Doom, Darkseid, Etc...)  &&Speaking of Zemo, I was disappointed at how quickly they used up Baron von Strucker. I thought they had cast him with a pretty interesting actor, but then he bites the dust in the opening scene. Lame. 

&&Oh man I've been wanting some Thunderbolts. Preferably an amalgamation of Baron Zemo and Norman Osborn's teams.

They already have Baron Zemo and Ghost in the MCU just throw in the rest of the founding members and go from there. Songbird and Moonstone especially should be big characters. 

&&Her not doing spy stuff is also pretty reasonable. SHIELD is no more. The only thing she is is an Avenger now.&&“She’s not alone.”

> ""WHERE IS IT?!""&&His villains are with Sony. Even then he barely can.

The simple fact is Joker is far and away the dominant comic book villain. Suicide Squad was basically marketed as a joker movie and made bank. Joaquin Phoenix’s movie has huge hype. That wouldn’t happen with any marvel villain.&&But he did have a Bourne movie? && > On February 26, 2013, Howard said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that he had earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from South Carolina State University that year. He was awarded an honorary ""Doctorate of Humane Letters"" from SCSU after speaking at its commencement ceremony in 2012. However, he never attended the university[23] and in fact the university is not empowered to confer doctorates in chemical engineering.[26]&&He is not wrong.  You think 1 * 1=1?  Think of it the Terry way.  You have 2 items 1 bean and 1 bean.  You want to have the one bean multiplied by the other bean.  How is that 1 bean?  Did the other bean just disappear?  If 1 * 1=1 you are saying that destruction of matter and energy is possible.  Lord Terry has taught us this and his teachings are law.  &&I'd love to be so rich you go insane.&&He's also a big fan of baby wipes and will tell anyone about it.&&Right?

The wildly successful show on which he's a central character.

I'm sure he'd take that War Machine payday in a heartbeat, but it's not like he faded into obscurity. &&Yea but his [divorce settlement](https://pagesix.com/2017/06/22/court-reinstates-terrence-howards-divorce-judgment/) is hilariously bad. Basically he had to pay between $70k-$4m per year depending on income, but that was BEFORE *Empire* premiered. That show became an instant hit, and he's making like $125,000/episode, but he's basically working for his ex-wife.&&Cheadle doesn't produce the Air Force Colonel vibe for me. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy, but it generally just bothers me how movies and TV can just switch actors for sequels and recurring roles. I get how schedules, contracts, and ratings work, but it just feels like a disservice to moviegoers and viewers. Not like he was ever going to be more than a supporting character. I'm used to Cheadle by now but at first it was just awkward.&&Cheadle's rhodey is an entirely different character. A character I just do not care much for.&&Ah I missed that. Makes sense!&&Obligatory response that the MCU does not strictly follow comic book canon, but is just heavily based on it.  If they wanted to kill Hulk, they could find a way to kill Hulk.&&at this specific moment in Marvel Comics, he just straight up IS impossible to keep dead. Resurrection has been legitimized as one of his powers. Read Immortal Hulk (his current run). It’s really really good stuff. &&It sure SOUNDED like Hugo Weaving.

It's one of my favorite films of all time.  Definitely in my top ten, possibly top 5.  That's just my opinion though. To each their own! :)

Scarlett was great in it though.  Probably her best performance in my opinion.&&well in the MCU didn't BW and Hawkeye know each other previously? &&Yeah what actually happened in Budapest? &&Hugh Jorgen&&This is my assistant, Wang Bang.&&They show her birthday as being in 1984 in one of the movies.  It's never really been explained how she could have been working for the Soviets.&&In the comics she's around 90 years old. She essentially got the Russian Super Soldier Serum which increased her lifespan. &&Comic Black Widow is the recipient of a minor version of the super soldier serum which increases lifespan.  They might incorporate that into the movie?  They'll probably just ingore her soviet origins though.&&>  or they introduce some weird soviet splinter faction that operates well past the dissolution of the USSR

Well, that was easy enough.&&Anti-aging serum or some comic device that makes her age and look fitting. In the comics that's how it was explained, she was given some super soldier serum that slows her aging. &&Goldblum was amazing.&&Beta Ray Bill? &&Wizard vs Fighter&&The villain from SpiderMan Homecoming was great.&&Killmonger (Black Panther) was fantastic.

I'm partial to Baron Zemo from Civil War.  He manages to destroy the Avengers without having to take them on directly.  And his motivations are completely understandable, if a bit twisted.  He's not looking to rule the world... he just wants someone to pay for what happened to his family.
&&I rewatched all the Marvel movies before Infinity War, and the main villain of Iron Man is so good except for the final... 15 minutes? when he puts on a suit.

One of the most compelling villains. So ruthless throughout the entire movie without having any powers for most of it. 

I like Zemo a lot in Civil War. (I don't know how reddit feels about that movie currently. I still like it.)

Vulture by Michael Keaton is fantastic. A lot of it has to do with Michael Keaton's talent. Another large part is keeping the stakes low, and him just wanting to be a thief but not a murderer or ruler of the world or evil god of the Dark Dimension. (Dormmamu was good though, as the ruler of that place. It's just that his minions suck.)

Not MCU, but still Marvel... Kingpin is perfect. Like the Iron Man 1 guy, but they don't sour his ending by suddenly giving him powers. (But of course Daredevil isn't as powerful as Iron Man. BUT of course, they managed to get around that disparity with Zemo.)&&Superman's got a few but most of them feel like Justice League villains rather than Superman specific. As for Wonder Woman I can only think of Cheetah, Ares, and Giganta. And Giganta is on a time share with The Atom and Apache Chief.  &&And her face and identity have now been televised globally. She can't really infiltrate any organizations now. &&I didnt notice it the first time I watched the film but it was one of my favorite moments upon rewatch. So much weight in her words considering her past. A shame it's often overlooked with thor being a badass&&I like that one a lot. Another favorite is said when the drop ships touchdown. 

“Vision get your ass back on that table” &&Love the little Avengers leit motif there.&&5. Dat ass&&I know it's a joke, but she didn't. She explicitly says she will leave her knowledge (and only that) in an accessible form.&&No boom boom before big fight&&But did he? &&For anyone wondering, no Terrance Howard has no logical basis for his claim.

>In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Howard explained that he had formulated his own language of logic, which he called Terryology, and which he was keeping secret until he had patented it. This logic language would be used to prove his contention that ""1 x 1 = 2"".

>""How can it equal one?"" he said. ""If one times one equals one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect. One times one equals two because the square root of four is two, so what's the square root of two? Should be one, but we're told it's two, and that cannot be.""

He just doesn't understand the basic principles of multiplication and is thinking of it like it's addition. &&I know you're just joking, but that's how he truly believes it.  The problem is that in the equation that he's attempting to break down, there aren't two items 1 bean and 1 bean.  There is 1 instance of 1 bean. &&I want to see a time travel plotline that goes back to Iron Man 1 and has Don Cheadle in his scenes just to fuck with him. &&It's not a show that caters to Reddit's demo, so obviously he's a nobody now.&&At least the transition happened during the worst Iron Man film so we could take it as a soft hit.&&I get a janitor vibe from cheadles rhodey. Like he was just mopping up and saw an iron man suit open and went with it. &&Cheadle looks soft tbh &&he looks like that guy who invented Skynet&&Thank you. It's still hard seeing Don cheadle as some bad ass superhero.&&He doesn't fit, physically, the Rhodey of the 70s & 80s comics.&&He's the straight man to tony but he's a really wooden straight man. Like I don't care or want to know about his life outside of being the other iron man suit. With Sam Wilson you have a solid connection and you could really enjoy his banter with bucky and steve. I wouldn't necessarily need to see a Sam Wilson cap movie but he's not just there to be a random voice in the scene&&The fact that he phones in all his performances doesn't help either.&&My moneys on Hulk winning&&I feel the need to point out that Marvel could probably use their CGI model of the Hulk for the rest of eternity without ever bringing back Mark Ruffalo, if they wanted.&&Yeah otherwise we'd see the movie version of Wolverine regenerating from a drop of blood. &&That was Ross Marquand (Aaron from The Walking Dead)&&B b bbut thor is my favorite.&&Yea they do, but none of the movies went into details &&There is no onscreen version of what happened in Budapest that will ever live up to the literary device of not knowing what happened in Budapest.&&There's the movie! &&Dick Richards.&&She's a spy. She just made up the birthday for reasons. She's also an elite spy program, so maybe she works for the soviets in an off the books operation that didn't get the memo&&The world of the MCU isn't exactly the same. She never said she was a Soviet, afaik. She could also have been a child assassin.&&That might help explain how she can fight in battle and even go one on one with Proxima Midnight in the movie.

Dude is struggling with some out-in-the-open mental health issues. &&Yeah... i mean isn't this an epiphany you are supposed to have in third grade when you do multiplication by looking at a length and a width and then adding up the area with graph paper by counting all the squares?  

1x1 = 1(1x1)   1x2 = 2(1x1)     2x2 = 4(1x1)  


Harder to have that Epiphany with just text.    1x1 = 1 in a story problem would be 'how many 1x1 blocks can fit into an area that is 1 wide and 1 long?  The answer is 1 you dumb ass.  

Yeah he obviously doesn't understand what multiplication is at any conceptual level.  &&how many times must I hit my head to forget what I just read?&&1x1

Replace the first two characters with ""one this many times:""

See?  That many....times?  1 times 1 you could even say?

Hell, let's just shorten it, use an X for the times, yeah.  That's easier.

Yeah, so one, one time, or as you put it, one bean, as many times as one bean...is......yeah....yeah....you can do it....

Terry: ""It's two beans man I cayn't....""&&**IT'S THE NUMBER 1, ONE TIME.

&&Call me crazy, but I love Iron Man 2. The whole ""what's keeping you alive is killing you"" thing really, really resonated with me. It's awesome he created a new element, as well. &&Have you not watched Captain Planet!?&&Make him be the same character he was in Rush Hour 2. Would love seeing a kung fu fighting black man in the marvel universe&&""no I won, easily.""&&After watching Thanos beat him like a bitch I'd take that bet.&&Mine is on Nebula killing Thanos. With Gamoras help.&&I'm not saying that Hulk is going to die in part 2.  I'm just saying that the fact that comic book Hulk is basically immortal doesn't mean movie Hulk has to be too.&&True, we don't even see Ruffalo for a good chunk of Thor 3, despite the fact that Hulk is a major character in the movie.&&Yeah, overall I think Hulk and Thor are relatively easy characters to mostly write out of the series without completely killing them off.  And you're right, while recasting Bruce Banner might be out of the question, recasting Hulk is not.  Although overall if Ruffalo wanted to leave I think they'd mostly write out the character, even if they didn't kill him.

I think Iron Man and Captain America are most likely to die in Avengers 4, not just because the actors have indicated wanting to be done, but also because I think they're the characters who are hardest to mostly write out without killing them.  For both characters, it's kind of been established that retiring is just uncharacteristic of them, which would make it hard to have them go off and do their own thing without returning to help next time the world is in danger.  Compared to Hulk who could definitely be off doing his own thing, or Thor who already has the easy potential plot of retiring as a superhero to rebuild and rule Asgard (especially if they end up undoing everything in Infinity War and not just the Snap).&&not crazy into detail, but IIRC when the avengers went to Hawkeyes farm in AoU, they called BW ""Aunt Nat""&&I remember them saying they crossed paths a lot while Nat was still a spy, and he was the one to vouch for her joining SHIELD, so they had to have some form of relationship prior.&&I’d be alright with taking place like 10 years ago. Before the events of Iron Man 2. If A4 has some timey-wimey stuff then that’d be a great place for a tie-in. &&Lump Beefbroth!&&Buck Fonanza&&The Black Widow has been enhanced by biotechnology that makes her body resistant to aging and disease and heals at an above human rate;[68] as well as psychological conditioning that suppresses her memory of true events as opposed to implanted ones of the past without the aid of specially designed system suppressant drugs.&&In winter soldier, during the scene where they’re at Flacon’s house, she says “I guess I just traded in the KGB for Hydra” so she did work for the Russians at some point - maybe not the soviets due to her age, but I guess that was implied in age of ultron since she was trained at a young age.&&She got the early Russian Version &&Depends on level. Fighters are linear. Wizards are quadratic. A level 1 wizard would get squished by a level 1 fighter.&&He really does. I was thinking about that recently, how they both have such iconic villains to fight and there's just so many of them. 

He has so many villains in fact, that they decided to cram 3 of them in Spider-Man 3 for whatever reason&&The X-Men have some great villains as well.

Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth, Sentinels, Mojo, Apocalypse, Mr. Sinister, the Reavers, Hellfire Club, etc... etc...&&I think Superman is just a notch or two below them. Lex Luthor and Darkseid are A-class villains, and after that he has a few B+ heavyhitters like Brainiac, Bizarro, and Toyman.&&And in doing so, demonstrated to T'Challa and the other heroes that isolationist policies make the world a more dangerous place; that jealously hiding and guarding your abundance from the outside world only leads to strife and suffering; that exporting warfare leads to disaster.

That's why he was the villain, not the hero.
&&What, you mean like one of those ""let's just state facts"" scenarios? In which case: yes, yes it is. We're all stating facts here.

There has only been one Jurassic Park film.&&>root cause of the problem.

I see what you did there. &&You're absolutely correct as I'm sure he's the origin of that information.&&Imagine this is actually the reason that this whole time he thinks the square root of 2 is 2..&&I think it goes deeper than that. Personally this if my favorite nugget from terryology

>""I was always wondering, you know, why does a bubble take the shape of a ball? Why not a triangle or a square? I figured it out. If Pythagoras was here to see it, he would lose his mind. Einstein, too! Tesla!,"" he told Rolling Stone.&&√2 isn't the only irrational thing here.&&Or maybe just dumb? Maybe just embarrassed at this point and refuses to back down? &&The problem is that explanation wouldn't even help him. He'd say that you have 1 length and 1 width so you have 2 sides. So 1 x 1 = 2. 

I think a better way of looking at it would be multiplication is you have one number that represents how many groups of items you have and another number that represents how many items are in each group. So 2 x 2 means you have 2 groups, with 2 items each for 4 total items. 1 x 1 is 1 group with 1 item, so 1 total item. 

I'm sure he'd still argue against it, especially if he figured out that the analogy gets tougher once you start multiplying more than 2 numbers together. That's just the most ELI5 way I can come up with explaining simple multiplication.&&> The real problem is that he never took the time to understand the twelve postulates of real numbers

Most people probably haven't done this.&&Yeah, they definitely poked at the change with that line.&&Badassium!

MoCap is not easy.&&They've got an easy setup to rebirth captain America though. Steve Rogers is already no longer Captain America, he is currently ""Nomad"". Then assuming everything gets tied up nicely at the end of the new avengers movie, Falcon can assume the mantle of Captain America. There is a series of comics in which this happens so it isn't too far fetched.

Then Tony dies and Steve Rogers can fade to black with a ""new"" captain America in place.

Alternatively there is another version of events in which bucky Barnes takes on the mantle of captain America. This is another easy way to phase out Steve and bring in another charismatic personality to hold the shield&&They also remember Budapest very differently.&&Phillip DeGasch&&Slab Bulkhead!&&Wait, so she's like Bucky but better?&&Typical case of studio interference. I think Raimi wanted to use Sandman, and had obviously been building to Green Goblin 2 for a couple of films, but the studio had obviously heard that all the cool kids like Venom and insisted they shoehorn him in, instead of building to it over a couple of movies like they should have.&&> The X-Men have some great villains as well.

I'm quite confident that Coogler and Marvel have noticed the criticisms, and will allocate their time and money appropriately with the sequel.&&I hated that so much.

So he goes himself with a few of his guard and the women disappear one at a time and then BP gets wounded and is on the run.

Comments seem fine now though. I'm just bothered by some people cause they don't seem to criticize the movie. They criticize the reaction to the movie, like a backlash to the fandom.

Could the CGI use some work here and there? Sure. Could the third act be better? Absolutely, just like most Marvel movies. But I guess the popularity and gangbuster numbers leave it prime for over-criticism. Titanic went through the same thing back in 97.&&Part of the problem with black panther is that because it's such a milestone film, most people are not allowed to criticize it. The review scores for it are ridiculously inflated. I thought it was on par with ant man, good not great. Call it anything close to mediocre in public though and it's a huge problem. 
 
Hoping part two is way better because Chadwick boseman is amazing. &&I admire your bravery&&Man they should bring Blade back&&this comment made me one step closer to my r/movies bingo&&It can't be a James Gunn film without Michael Rooker, and they wiped Yondu...

&&Lmao Jesus, I totally forgot about that trash. &&Nah, T'Challa would just sign with them too&&By the time the film starts production, the Warriors will have already signed Antetokounmpo, Davis & Harden.&&well where is W’Kabi now?

They can make him a villian or pull a Loki in Thor 2.&&Sigh.  I’d so love a well done Achebe as CJ Priests run of BP is what made me fall in love with the character....
&&That’s my thought as well. T’Challa opened up Wakanda and they were almost immediately thrown in the middle of an intergalactic conflict. I’d imagine the people of Wakanda might have an issue with that.&&As much as I love IM3 I'm sad we never got to really see Iron Man vs the Mandarin&&they originally planned to have a range of different powered villains however they decided that a micky rorke that vanted his burd and a large group of faceless drones was more compelling. &&We gonna sit here and act like Thor going against malekith is a great choice?

It's not exactly pc, and there's probably already a supersomething in Marvel with the name, but I think it could slide by without too much criticism. &&Sony still has the rights to Kraven, and they want to make a solo movie like they did for Venom because they're dumb.&&Coogler originally wanted to put Kraven in the first BP, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he wanted to put him in a sequel.&&I think Kraven wouldn't work that well against Black Panther. The thing with Spidey v Kraven is that they're from wildly different environments.&&He might not be his arch if we have to scramble our brains to figure it out. Lol.&&Man Ape is already established as an ally to T'Challa, and it wouldn't really make sense for him to rebel now after the events in the first BP gave him such a great opportunity to do so.



I think they should bring in Doom as the villain, there's some fantastic comicbook imagery to call back to, with the whole Doomwar plotline. Too bad they only acknowledge Baast in a throwaway line.&&In the comics klaw comes back as a supernatural being made of sound. So yeah&&Sort of like Tony stark in iron man 3?&&There's not much on his connections... He doesn't rely on the connections to them besides knowledge, the suit is mainly it but that's what we're here for, the suit. Badass fights, tactical leadership, etc etc. Only time he relies on connectoins is when the herb effects go away and he connects directly with Bast to get his powers back and become king of the dead (doubt they'll explore Black Panther's zombie controlling ability in films though)&&I wish the panther god was legit in the mcu. If only for the exchange with Dr. Doom.&&Well, if you think about it, he’s going to be the last Black Panther who has those heightened senses and such, thanks to Killmonger destroying the flower...

Unless they magically find some more, that is...&&You mean like Aang the avatar in the avatar realm?? 

So, T'challa learn from Black Panther predecessor in Ancestral Realm..&&They already did that on the first one, so hopefully they don't do it again.&&Same. Absolutely loathe it. Their superpowers are what makes me interested in the first place. 

I’m honestly more entertained if they just explore *how* invincible the suit is through neat and cool ways while providing tension elsewhere.

John Wick is an invincible badass the entire series but they build tension through other means.&&They also often try to quit in the sequel. &&Sure, but this is more ""the villain is tough enough to overpower the hero"". There's a reason there's no Thor film where he just beats up security guards. 
&&So did Klaue - his sonic cannon easily damaged the vibranium car, which makes sense since it's a modified vibranium mining tool.&&I was just going to say the same.  I never really felt any stakes in any of the Marvel movies.  It's honestly one of my biggest issues with that universe.  It's not just a superhero thing though because I never felt that way about the X-Men films or even the DC films, for that matter.  But the MCU to me always just felt very safe.  Even in IW when everyone was snapping out of existence, I just was kinda like, 'I wonder who is gonna be the one to bring them back for the next film?'&&IW would have been way cooler if all the information about future movies and performer contracts wasn't easily available&&Black Widow is damn near invincible and it actually frustrates me the most of any marvel character.&&That damn genius.

&&Im really disappointed we had a fight in a sci-fi future mine and all we got out of was some bullet train mine carts. That whole final fight was so disappointing.&&Yeah the CGI was really noticeable that fight really took me out of it too&&1) Being shot by the second unit doesn't mean the director has no control over the scenes, it only means they aren't on set that day. They're still heavily involved in the staging, planning, and setup of these scenes.

2) The *vast majority* of action movies shoot with second (and sometimes third) units, so it's not as if Marvel is unusual in this regard.

3) By this logic most Marvel flicks should have bland action, but Marvel movies have loads of good actions scenes.&&The way he talks about it, it seems like he had some measure of control over the casino scene, at least. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNHc2PxY8lY&&Then how come the Russo Bros. action scenes are always the best ones&&Coogler basically doesn't do a movie without his crew, so I'm sure she's back unless she gets hired elsewhere at the time of scheduling. &&They could bring back Terence howard as t'challa and no one would notice a difference :P&&> But I guess the popularity and gangbuster numbers leave it prime for over-criticism.

I dont remember&&Hey don’t forget about Idris Elba!&&Well I mean to the credit all three are really good...&&Sterling Brown's only gotten roles in the last three years and that's because his TV work is phenomenal.

Other 2 are spot on&&[deleted]&&Eh, I just see that as a cop-out. Like they still want to bring a character back, but they do it in this convoluted way so as to not piss off continuity fans.

*Oh don't worry guys, that character is still dead! He just happens to have the exact same memories and lived the literal exact same life as the other one but this one didn't die. And now he's in this universe so its cool. Its NOT the same one though.*

PANTHERS!!!&&That could work as well. Maybe Latveria even discovered and had conflict with Wakanda in the age of colonisation.&&This would be the best way to introduce Doom, honestly. There are not many good villains for Black Panther, so bringing in things from other properties is almost required. Could have a cool nation vs. nation conflict with Latveria trying to invade Wakanda or something now that the ruse is up and the world knows how prosperous the country is. &&I want a Dr. Doom stand alone movie really bad. Just make the F4 side characters or leave 'em out, who cares... but give me Doom.&&I wish Mads Mikkelsen hadn't already been in MCU as I think he would be a great Dr. Doom.&&This would be amazing, if not only because Michael b Jordan and Chris Evans both played the human torch, and they will be forced to cast a third.&&Dr. Doom as played by MF Doom.  At the very least let him do work on the soundtrack.  I know it'd never happen but man that'd make my life.&&Well, a few years ago he drowned the country of Wakanda with Magic super powers in the comics. BP had a blood feud with him for a while there. &&In one comic he literally flooded the entire city. He was beefed up with the Phoenix Force at the time, but he still killed hundreds, if not thousands of Wakandans. That later led to a full on war between Atlantis and Wakanda


The Atlantians in Marvel are also highly technologically advanced, and superhumanly strong, so they can pose a threat in and out of the water.&&Depending on the writer, Namor can go toe to toe with the Hulk and Thor for a while.  He's actually beaten the Hulk underwater.

He can also fly.

In theory Namor outclasses Black Panther in every way.&&Namor debuted first. Aquaman is the inferior copy. &&In the comics, Namor did destroy Wakanda, but I believe his power was boosted by ~~passing~~ possessing 1/5 of the Phoenix at the time

He is pretty damn powerful though, even outside of water. He has superhuman strength (enough to hold his own against the Hulk), superhuman speed, and the ability to fly (the last one is because he's also a mutant). He also doesn't get weaker out of water as long as he keeps himself wet, and even if he doesn't, he can still fly and only slowly falls back to normal human abilities otherwise (instead of becoming incredibly weak or collapsing I mean)&&Namor is owned by Universal, not Fox.&&This is a subtle nod to SoundCloud containing the word sound&&How dare you&&I think the problem is, he (W'Kabi) isn't in the wrong. No one person was in the movie (except maybe Killmonger's actions after obtaining kingship or Klau). T'Challa is the rightful king from a moral and even spiritual standpoint, not necessarily a legal one (are you really allowed to heal in between the ritual?? and then continue the fight? Erik's 'Nah, that's over with' is pretty on point). W'Kabi has loyalties to his country and Okoye and in the final moments gave into the winning side. 

He is probably not in jail - but his friendship with T'challa is 100% strained. T'Challa's UN speech is also not 'exactly' what W'Kabi meant with 'fixing' the situation by force from the beginning. W'Kabi seems to be pro-authoritarian and also isolationist. I also think the chances of convincing Daniel Kaluuya to play a bad guy is pretty good.  It seems like a very obvious direction for him to be the foil to offload wakandan weapons or become a complex antagonist.
&&Plus Daniel Kaluuya is way too good an actor to just leave in prison. And you have that dynamic with Danai Guirra's character (because they were together in the first movie)&&good point - also, the infinity stones were not hidden in a vault in Wakanda, as on Asgard. 

T'Challa welcomed the outsiders and gave them aid that brought the war to their steps. Assuming there's lasting consequences from Thanos Snap - why wouldn't a contingent of Wakandans be completely unsatisfied with T'Challa's first year. &&Thor against comics Malekith wouldve been fucking sweet. They watered him down to be pointless; changing the source wouldn't change anything in this case. &&They can just call him M'Baku&&They called him the great gorilla or something similar in the movie. No one caught it because, it was said by Angela Basset and it was done out of respect&&M'Baku Lord of Spiders&&People used to say that about Hulk Hogan. WWE still had him grow out his goatee and act like an asshole. &&Nah he needs to go the CM Punk route 

“I don’t hate you T’Challa...I just hate this idea that you’re the best. You’re not the best. I’m the best. I’m the best in the world”&&They are so consistently dumb it's crazy.&&Fucking Sony!&&Marvel, just give the greedy bastards $200 million upfront and let us have an honest to good Kraven actually fight Spider-Man.&&They may be dumb, but it seems to be working for them. Venom has already made back its production budget domestically, despite every obstacle. 

It was in development hell for years, it's got no Spidey, had trailers with awful *awful* dialog, got trashed in reviews, even Tom Hardy was talking trash on the studio for cutting out his favorite bits to trim it down to pg13. 

Yet it's turned a profit in its first week. &&I mean, he does have his SoundCloud account...&&If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.&&I wish they had gone even farther with the “only has pieces of the suit” action sequence. When he just has the one glove, one boot and a pistol? Very clever stuff. 

I really like Iron Man 3, shame it gets shit on so much. &&Minus the country side-story...&&All the herbs are dead though, right?&&I mean... Does he control existing zombies, or can he make them?&&i wish Dr. Doom was legit in the mcu&&Or they just introduce Bast the panther God like in the comics.

It's really not a big deal the herbs being destroyed. &&It takes like two lines of script to establish that of course they had more hidden away. &&Right. When I was typing out that response I was thinking about Iron Man 3 or Spider-Man 2. As soon as I hit submit I was like ""wait, they even did it in THIS movie!"" haha&&Yep. As soon as I saw TChalla evaporate, I laughed. I just knew Bob Iger was on the phone with the writers saying “Uh...that’s another billion dollars you just CGI’d away. There better be a plan.”

And I agree. I’ve watched a few of them, but maybe only 4 or 5 including BP and IW. There’s just not enough risk in the movie to interest me. &&I watch for the fight scenes honestly. The thanos fights on Titan were amazing.&&And if the source material wasn't so widely known. I'm sure even people who don't check up on production schedules of films had someone tell them ""They come back in the comics"".&&I'm sure they like knowing that people care about every word they say, fuels the ego&&It's from the very end of the second Garfield Spider-Man.&&Rhino from the Ultimate universe has a robotic suit&&Rhino looks so fucking badass in the PS4 game.

Similar idea. &&You didn’t even mention that it ends right before the fight even starts.&&Yeah, but we also got [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p3c4crHbjzU/hqdefault.jpg) amazing last shot, so it was kind of worth it &&Stannis would be proud &&Don't you mean... fewer? ಠ_ಠ&&It wouldn't even be that similar, with Namor presented as an antagonist and an anti-hero at best.

But in the section of [this article](https://mcuexchange.com/the-facts-about-the-live-action-rights-of-marvel-characters/) about Wilson Fisk, Feige said, *”Kingpin we either have or somehow share.

I remember thinking it was unnecessary when I was watching it.&&Maybe I'm just blind but man was it hard to keep track of which person was which in the dark when both are wearing black.&&I liked the BP/Killmonger fight tho' but I concede that just about every other fight or action set piece in the movie was better.  I think the problem is that they really should have given the two more variance in styles.  Have BP use one set of martial arts to Killmongers alternate.  Especially as Killmonger was a soldier so he should've been more raw and rugged with BP being the more graceful fighter.  &&They should have ended the movie with them both losing their costumes from the sonic blades forcing them to get into a Civil-War style practical-effect wire fight.&&The *first* T’Challa v. Killmonger fight (on the waterfall) was also pretty good&&Too bad they killed him off&&After Killmonger died, I was literally thinking to myself “That was it...?” That’s what the director of Creed gave us?

Unbelievably bad. &&I always found it funny that Whedon claimed the Avengers final sequence was designed from top to bottom by the VFX team with him just providing final approval. It honestly makes so much sense.&&Yeah and that's the only good action scene in the movie.&&I'm pretty sure the John Wick guys were doing 2nd unit for Winter Soldier or Civil War.

The world could use more Wood Harris, for instance. &&Maybe when we get more varied leading roles we'll get more varied minority actors and actresses.

Every Fantastic 4 movie has been lame. The characters are not very exciting, and the big hero's power is that he's stretchy. That works in The Incredibles, but that's not going to look cool in live action.

&#x200B;

Doom wears a metal mask and his name is ""Victor Von Doom"". That's the lamest of stupid names for anyone in the history of names. The only thing worse is ""Doctor Doom"". Jesus that's unimaginative. Oh wow you guys were betrayed by the guy who's name is ""doom"", *who could have seen that coming*?

&#x200B;

Edit: His metal mask looks super lame. &&MF Doom will just send a dude dressed like him to all the shoots &&I can already see the poster with the head of that giant panther statue barely peaking out of the water&&I mean, that depends on what version of Black Panther we're talking about. The Black Panther who was directly connected to the Panther God and was also the King of the Dead was about even with Namor, physically, but BP had the overall advantage due to his intelligence and technology. They fought several times after the AvX storyline, and, although the encounters ended inconclusively, BP came out looking better in pretty much every instance. And when Namor betrayed the Avengers to the Cabal, it was T'Challa who planned Namor's defeat.

[Edit: Typo.]&&They're really completely different characters. Different powers, very different costumes, very very different storylines and role in the world, very very very different character traits ajd personalities.  While it's obvious to compare the two all the time, it's very strange to me to consider one to be based off the other. &&/r/moviedetails&&Hollywood Hulk was just too sweet&&""I'm leaving with the Black Panther suit on July 17th. And hell, who knows? Maybe I'll go defend it in Shonen Jump. Maybe I'll go to Image Comics.""

*Turns to camera*

""Hey, Invincible, how ya doing?""&&They ruined the Dark Tower. I had such low, low hopes and they still got me.&&That's what we say but enough of you guys go and break records for the opening of Venom. They'll stop once we stop paying&&Yep. I'm so bummed. No way they're consolidating the spidey universe into the MCU now.&&I do too.  Iron Man 3 is the best of the three in my opinion.  In part because Shane Black wrote a movie where the characters actually have personality, something sorely missing from Iron Man 2 (tho' I don't think that's on Favereu since Marvel was hellbent on forcing in the Avengers connection into it).  Partly also because they changed it up throughout the movie, with some genuine surprises and wtf moments.  Like the VR thing when he saves the whole presidential cabinet.  He does an near impossible save only for him to get hit by a truck.  You gasp and then you see no one's in the suit.  That was good.

Plus, I get Shane Black isn't everyone's cup of tea but at least there was a consistent and constant vision/narrative throughout the movie.  Something some of Marvel's other movies would later come to enjoy when they let their directors have some fun (Taika, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler for instance).

Edit: And the Russos deserve some love too.&&The real shame is that the wasted such an amazing character. Mandarin is one of iron strongest enemies only for them to say he fake and basically bum... the shit that it gets is their own doing&&They grow near the vibranium source. They can get more no problem.&&He can control them. And I mean, technically he can make them too. If he kills someone they’ll go to the city of the dead, which he’s king of so... lol&&Soon my friend. Soon.&&Yeah, if Spider-man and T'challa hadn't been dusted, the stakes would have felt more real since their films were already announced.&&For a second there I forgot you were talking about Andrew Garfield and I was like there was a Garfield the car Spiderman and two of them!? Why I have not seen them. 

EDIT: Will not fix. Petition to make Garfield come back as a car. &&Not that the Garfield/Webb/ASM movies are in the MCU, but the MCU does base a lot of stuff off the ultimate comics. Not everything but quite a bit. 

I'm hoping DD S3 doesn't cause I want some heroin addict pornstar Karen Page up in this bitch. &&Without spoiling it, the stealth Rhino mission is so epic. It's not hard but it's such a cinematically cool mission. Insomniac really nailed the villains.&&Yeah, he looks great! Loved all the enemies in that, just wish the fights had been more spread out instead of lumped towards the end. The suit above Judy’s looks too clunky, but I guess I’d need to see it in action&&God I love that suit so much. &&Long may he reign.&&More less CG fewer please?

I dunno, it doesn't convey the same message.&&yeah of course. Civil War wasn't identical to BvS either (thank fuck for that), just that something thematically similar appearing in Marvel around the same time would be interesting.

Has an MCU film actually had a proper underwater sequence so far? Two come to mind, the recent one from Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Tony/Stark Tower's introduction in Avengers. Any others?&&James Cameron already did Aquaman. It starred Vinnie Chase. Beat Tobey McGuire’s Spiderman for biggest opening weekend ever. You should check it out!  &&I agree. They played the “Rising” out completely. Also forget “Forever”.&&Yeah, but they were definitely a bit out there for such a high budget. Dunkirk is also pretty different in not having a main character. His passion projects just happej to be high budget.&&Inception & Interstellar were his passion projects for sureeee&&Well, ""One for them, one for me"" is a pretty old way of getting through the film business. It's just nowadays the ""one for them"" is almost exclusively franchise films instead of adaptations of bestselling airport novels.&&> Jojo Rabbit.

> Ethnically incorrect Adolf Hitler played by Taika

Ohhhh man that's dope&&That was a problem IMO. I love BP but that fight scene was amazing from an emotional standpoint. Delivery on the visuals was rough. &&>  Especially as Killmonger was a soldier so he should've been more raw and rugged with BP being the more graceful fighter. 

Or vice versa.  A JSOC soldier is going to be more fluid.&&That was my hope, too. I wasn't expecting all practical effects, as I'd seen the trailer, but man was I hoping for more actual fighting. &&Pretty good?? That was damned good.&&He was the best character in the whole movie. Stole every scene he was in. &&I know he was my favorite part of the movie.&&If this were the x-men universe he could just come back later at some point with no real explanation. Oh well&&in the comics he dies and gets remade into a being of pure sound, and all things being equal thats not the craziest thing the mcu has done&&I think the horrible CGI didint help. Hands down the worst of all the MCU movies.&&I liked the waterfall fight between Killmonger and T'challa.&&They pitched in during the airport fight specifically. &&I’m Harley Quinn, y’all!&&Is he cool?&&In all seriousness, I think he would play a good Black Mask or Two-Face.&&I didn't know how much I wanted this in my life. &&He can climb anything!&&Lakeith Stanfield is doing OK.&&*Mikai Pfieffer looks on sad from off stage...*&&Don't you say anything bad about my boy Cottonmouth. &&Lakeith Stanfield is definitely on the rise, he's just in weirder projects. &&It's weird because for awhile there, we were getting a lot of varied black actors.  But it's like Hollywood relied on the old guard so much that they kinda forgot to find the next Denzel/Idris/Samuel Jackson/etc etcs.

&&Are you sure it's not just that you're not paying attention? Because that's what I think it is.&&I don't think the problem,is them casting the same 3 people the problem is that there aren't enough roles for them to be picked and other stars to get picked. There's only a few main black characters in most every blockbuster. &&> The world could use more Wood Harris

I had to google the name, but shiit, you're right, Avon Barksdale needs to be in a lot more movies&&Hey! I’ve had this question for a bit. Is it that there’s a lack of black actors or is it that they only cast certain ones?&&Lakeith is taking off and he’s a god damn miracle. I agree that we could stand to see a lot more black leading men in Hollywood, though.&&Or if they could cast poc in roles that traditionally go to white people. There are so many roles where race isn’t important but they go to white actors by default. New star wars is doing a decent job of hiring diverse cast. movies like crazy rich asians, black panther, & hidden figures have shown studio execs that people will pay money to see movies staring people that aren’t white&&Really thought NWA would be their launching pad to superstardom but neither of them seems to have taken that leap yet. &&Alternate universe versions don't really count imo.&&That was an alternate universe where they didn't die but Wayne did so it doesn't count.  

I'll kindly ask you to leave the Androids Dungeon now. AWAY!&&Technically they weren't ever brought back from the dead, they never died in that universe. &&I just snorted loudly. Thanks for that&&at least each of the wells have different lives/memories/personalities, they’re not just carbon copies created as a way of resurrecting a popular character (for the most part)&&Flash gets a free pass because of the Speedforce basically making anything and everything possible. 

I vastly prefer them embracing the insanity and having alternative universe Nazis invading.&&What, so literally everyone who's died the last few years get resurrected? Or do you mean that some big bad is gonna pick out the villains to resurrect from the Soul Realm or whatever?&&I mean, as long as they do it *well* I'm ok with it. We started with a dude in an iron suit beating up other dudes with suits and now we've got alien invasions and magic going on at the same time. If they're able to drop in most of the comic book tropes without becoming a steaming pile, I'm happy. One meaningful death, one good reason why everyone isn't always brought back every time, and then they can start pointlessly killing people just to bring them back.&&Honestly though how dope would it be if the central conflict was happening with the first Wakandan Olympics occurring in the background.

That would make such a boss setting.&&People say they know they can’t believe, Wakanda we have a bobsled team!&&I understood that reference.&&That's not fair to Black Panther- His improvements are all natural! Captain America was injected with chemicals!&&There was actually an issue of Captain America in the 80's during the whole ""War on Drugs"" thing where a kid called Cap out. Said he was a hypocrite because he was coming to the school telling the not to do drugs, but he was Captain America because of drugs.

So Cap took the Super Soldier Serum out of his system. He was having to workout 4 hours a day to maintain his strength and stamina. He reflexes were slightly off. He eventually put the serum back in because he felt like it would eventually cost someone their life if he couldn't be the old cap.&&I was thinking for the MCU Latveria and Sokovia could be neighboring nations and maybe historically one but was broken up in the past then after the events AoU Latveria conquered Sokovia in guise of aiding them. &&It really is fucking disgusting how they show him no love, he’s easily one of the most powerful villains in the marvel universe. He’s single handedly bodied the entire avengers squad while sitting on his throne. Dude is a fucking badass. &&Deadpool started as a knock-off of Deathstroke. King of Atlantis in a comic book is a decent enough starting point. They diverge a lot from there.&&/r/shittymoviedetails&&I really enjoy these /r/squaredcircle crossovers.&&""Venom is so terrible, I've only gone to see it twice in theaters, fucking sony""&&1st one will always be best to me but the 3rd one does get unfairly shit on. I think it's because they took a good villain and ruined it. &&Tony getting wrecked by helicopters he invited to his house was one of the stupidest things I've seen in any marvel movie. Iron Man 3 is my least favorite of the trilogy. &&In a short film on the blue ray, [All hail the king] (https://youtu.be/mceyJxMuYFE), it explores that maybe there really is a mandarin in the mcu after all... &&There can still be a real Mandarin. The short they released confirms there's a real Mandarin in the MCU and I wouldn't be surprised if he makes it into a real movie
&&Honestly, that was one of my favorite moments in the MCU. Fans of the comics were expecting a badass mastermind. The movie built it up to provide that with a fantastic person in the role. Then, BOOM, the rug is pulled out from under you. 

I appreciate when Marvel can surprise, and judging from the audience reaction in the theater, they achieved it. It's especially good with the short [All Hail the King](https://youtu.be/mceyJxMuYFE). 

I didn't like the generic and boring Killian as a villain though, so the movie on a whole was some what of a meh for me.
&&On the flip side, they were faded away BECAUSE They have upcoming films. Most of those who remained are the original avengers so the next movie is going to be a farewell for a few of them so it’s their show.&&The stakes were already non-existent since they had just shown Thanos using the stones to un-kill Vision.&&The general audience doesn't pay attention to those kinds of announcements. When I went to see Infinity War, the kids in the theater who watched T'Challa and Peter get dusted were in disbelief. They didn't know about the contracts or the sequel announcements. For them, those deaths were real, and now they have to wait until Avengers 4 to see if their heroes will come back.&&I'm sure you meant ""Garfield the cat"" but I can't stop thinking of a genetically modified spider-vehicle named Garfield stopping crime and eating lasagna.&&I used to watch Garfield the car every morning before school&&Garfield the Love Bug&&
>I'm hoping DD S3 doesn't cause I want some heroin addict pornstar Karen Page up in this bitch. 

Why was this the thing that made me realise DD S3 looks to be an adaption of Born Again?

While I don't think they'll do that with Karen, I think they might have Bullseye kill her, essentially merging that story (can't remember when that happened) with born again, plus it is a decent way to get Punisher involved again with DD in S2. &&I would have liked to see more boss fights in the early sections of the game, but I don't know if I'd trade that for the [two double villain fights](#spoiler). Those were some of the more interesting fights I've seen in a superhero game, even if they were easy and a bit repetitive.&&He needs more blankets and he needs less blankets! &&It was short but in Captain America: The First Avenger just after Cap has the serum injected he's chasing the Hydra agents on foot and he drags the guy out of the submarine.&&Black Panther Origins
Black Panther Begins
Black Panther Rising
&&$150 million passion projects.&&Those are also bigger scale movies?&&I think he was thinking more like, a soldier would be practical and try to end an encounter in as few moves as possible. Black Panther would be more flourishing. But I can see where ur coming from too. Like how SHIELD agents fight. Only irl JSOCs aren't graceful. Their lightning fast and brutal as all hell.&&Yeah, they're crazy if they don't bring him back as the solid sound thing. Considering Serkis has such a solid set of credits voicing and motion-capturing CGI creatures, I'd say his return as Klaw was as sure a thing as there is these days. &&>Hands down the worst of all the MCU movies.

Let me tell you a little story about The Incredible Hulk....&&Agreed. It won’t age well at all. &&And I just imagined him saying ""C'mere puddin'"" to Joaquin Phoenix. 

I need this, dammit&&I know saying ""lol"" is a worthless comment, but seriously this made me loudly laugh in a quiet room. I love the scene this put in my head&&damn i misread this. Inthought it was mickey rookie. The dude from the wrestler movie.&&I don't know about Two-Face but Black Mask is a good idea. &&Nah, Two Face is supposed to be the well dressed, slim-cut bigshot lawyer.  Not a good ol' country boy.  Black Mask might work.&&And punch any woman!&&Dude is on his way to blowing up. He’s going in a more art house career direction, which I’m cool with because *Sorry To Bother You* was a trip.&&Speaking of *Atlanta*, Brian Tyree Henry seems to be in a ton of stuff in just the past year or so. Just check his [IMDb](http://imdb.com/name/nm3109964/), it’s fantastic just how much work he’s getting.&&I can’t wait for the day when someone complains about Lakeith Stanfield being in everything.&&Mikai Pfieffer looks sad because he once was that guy that Hollywood always went to.  :D  Him and Taye Diggs.&&There’s no Mekhi Phifer....&&I watched Sorry to Bother You last night; Lakeith Stanfield is madly talented, which I knew before but this movie absolutely confirmed it. Give this man all the roles. &&Taye Diggs Derek Luke &&But, they are all Wayne.&&Actually lore wise, it is literally the same universe.

Flashpoint isn't an alternate universe like Earth-3 with all their villains and such. &&That's just comic Speed Force though, AFAIK all TV Speed Force has done so far is to let you go so fast you can time travel or be in another dimension.&&What I’m hoping is that every death that actually happened presnap(Gemora, loki, quicksilver, vision) stays permanent. And that everyone else who was snapped is trapped in the soul stone and actually alive, just in that soul stone dimension but rescuable. That wouldn’t feel like cheating to me.&&Damn it, now I'm going to be disappointed if they don't do this:(&&But in the olympics, now that there are superhumans on earth, does each country get a super human on their team? Or is there no super humans that can compete? Do they have Genetic enhancement tests?&&I don't know what's in that flower but it falls right into the ""performance enhancing drug"" category&&I like the idea of Doom actually being a Sokovian who, after surviving the destruction of his home, rebuilds it into the new country of Latveria. He uses the leftover Ultron bots for his new Doom bots and it would also explain his hatred for the Avengers.&&Ooo I like where this is going!&&Sokovian refugees flood into Latveria. Doom accepts them in. Then annexes Sokovia and sends the refugees back. While also rebuilding Sokovia and making their lives better. 

World leaders are all upset. Yet cannot do anything. As Doom has apparently done good. Plus Doom and Latveria are basically impossible to act against through normal means. As doom has an army of doombots and a self sustaining economy. &&I wouldn't say that they don't show him love.. Just that they *haven't yet*. This whole thing so far has built up to the standoff with Thanos. There's no way that Dr. Doom isn't getting his dues behind closed doors for the future. Especially now that Fantastic Four is in Marvel's hands.&&They made a standalone short after IM3 came out that follows up on Trevor Slattery in jail after the fact.  It fixes every concern about ruining The Mandarin.&&Sounds pretty close to Raimi spider-man if the villian they ruined is Harry Osborne. And the first is best because of Bonesaw and Hunkle Ben. *mee-ow*&&Bald guy in the prisom was that the tailor from davedevil?!?!?&&All that AIM and no MODOK, although we did get a head in a jar in Shield&&Was that the tailor from daredevil!?!?&&Oh man, this is exactly how I feel about this movie. They did the little things well, Tony's ptsd, the funny Mandarin bullshit, even the kid was actually done really well, and doing a kid well is really super difficult. 

But they did a shit job of doing the big things, the big armor/extremis fight at the end was just not great. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. &&It was no coincidence that only the OG Avengers survived the snap. That solved two problems for the writers, by giving them the opportunity to make the next film feel more intimate and personal (literally less crowded), while setting up a proper send-off for some (most?) of those heroes.

At the same time, it definitely lessened the emotional impact of IW’s ending. I can’t understand how people were *shocked* at what they witnessed on screen when it was known that pretty much all of those characters already had sequels in the plans.

If the Russos had mixed it up a bit (by snapping some of the OGs and some of the newer supers), they’d have kept me on my toes. But when Tom Holland is shooting Far From Home as I write this, it’s hard to feel something for his character’s death (even if the movie takes place before the events of IW, as it seems likely).&&I very much prefer the chemistry between Castle and Page than Murdock and Page.&&I am afraid you're right.&&Also at the end when Cap turns the plane into a submarine for 70 years&&Tony was stuck underwater in his suit in Iron Man 3 after his house was attacked as well.&&That's exactly what I was getting at.  Thanks.

&&[deleted]&&This is 2018. I don't have any problem seeing Joker as a Gay man with a partner that also brings racial diversity. Only problem is that some people might use it to their advantage saying look gays are so bad. &&Still Leto in that universe bro&&TL;DR: lol&&Love the scene, not too sure I’m liking the image I got in my head.  I’ll see if it grows on me.&&I think you my be combining Mickey Rourke and Mickey Rooney....  
Edit: Which would be equal parts awful and amazing.&&Mork and Mindy? &&Hell yeah, I watched *Sorry* a couple of nights ago and what a stellar ride it was! He was absolutely brilliant in it, and as much as I hope he does smaller, more original films like this one, I also hope this ends up being his ticket to the big leagues.&&Zazie Beetz had a breakout performance in *Deadpool 2* and it looks like she'll have a central role in *Joker* (I think they're keeping it close to their chest that's she's actually a Harley analogue). Gambino obviously had an incredible year, and Hiro Murai had some great turns on both *Barry* & *Legion*. 

Whole *Atlanta* crew comin up. &&If our biggest problem in the future is Lakeith Stanfield getting too much work we’ll be living in a utopia.&&Oh god. Taye Diggs. Yep. Rochester native who was in everything from Ally McBeal to Rent. &&Omar Epps before all of em &&he was the only good thing about the Deathnote netflix movie.&&Lakeith is so fucking good. He can do like a calm dude from Atlanta to fucking panicking really fast moving dude in sorry to bother you. That's a wild turn of acting &&Vision is a robot. Just replace his battery with an actual battery and not an ingot of magical universe fuel and you still have Vision&&While that's solid on its own, that basically makes his motivations exactly the same as Zemo.&&I love when a plan comes together.&&[All Hail the King](https://youtu.be/mceyJxMuYFE) &&Its well made, but it feels like such a cop out.  Like they pull this reveal where Trevor is just a front for the real Mandarin, but everyone hates the real Mandarin in the movie, so they make a short film where we find out the real Mandarin was also just a front for the Real Real Mandarin, who's actually totally awesome and badass and no you cant see him on screen.&&BONESAW IS READYYYY&&> I can’t understand how people were shocked at what they witnessed on screen 

Probably more that Thanos won.&&Same here, her character does a very good job of 'humanising' Castle, he's cracked but not quite broken.

Whereas with DD she's just one of multiple side characters, semi-important in of herself, but not when it comes to DD as a character. &&Jiu-jitsu is great in one on one but in an open fight it's a great way to catch a boot to the head. I wouldn't imagine soldiers generally prepare for closed environment 1-1 fights. 

What I could see is stuff like flat hand to the trachea, ball shots, eyes, and just knowing that there is no line to not cross in a fight for your life. That said I am definitely not a soldier, used to think I could beat people up by knowing a bit of BJJ, and could be totally wrong.&&It would have been cool seeing them do wild counters to grappling and wrestling while blending other various elements to their fighting. I'm a huge fan of Bushmaster's fighting style (and character) in Luke Cage. Add different sauce to the fight get cool different shots.&&Indeed. Just watch any easily accessible video on youtube of a spetsnaz demonstration. In the movies, there are always these brief moments that in real life would have been a huge opening for the opponent. Things like spinning, flourishing, then there's just the over-accentuated movements.

And to your point about chokes instead of roundhouses, I loved Daredevil for this (especially when contrasted with the Punisher). He doesn't want to kill, and tries to knock all his opponents out with punches; as he does, the previously 'out' ones get up and come back. Thus you get that hallway fight where he fights what seems like the same 6 people as he runs into more. Compare that to the punisher, who just completely neutralizes the threat in the most effective means possible.

Now that I'm spelling it out, a properly trained Killmonger should win any fight against T'Challa. &&A gay Joker? Are you mad!? He'd be 10x crazier!... However, the antics would be entertaining as hell.

 *rubs chin in thought*&&The Gunn film would be a reboot.

I had to look this up because I can't imagine a world where Taye Diggs isn't working constantly.&&Twist:

He doesn't hate the Avengers at first. He couldn't care less. They're the reason Latveria is a whole nation again. He may even be thankful, till they interfere. Or just save him as a proper villain for the Fantastic Four. Let him even be an ally at first. Some crazy Science Shit is underway that is too much for Bruce, Tony and Shuri, so they call in Reed Richards and Victor Von Doom.

Thank you!&&> Now that I'm spelling it out, a properly trained Killmonger should win any fight against T'Challa.

The movies doesn't emphasize this nearly enough but in the comics, T'Challa is trained from birth to fight (even against someone like Killmonger).  Killmonger could win the fight but T'Challa should just edge out Killmonger in a fight.  &&Shuri says “he’ll never beat T’Challa. He should have just come to the first challenge...” 


I agree. I think T’Challa is supposed to be a legendary warrior.&&Good point. I would suppose that Wakanda would take into account various martial styles throughout the world when developing their own. I was thinking maybe T'Challa wasn't ready for that kind of fight, but now I'm remembering him in Civil War. Pretty much no one gave him grief except Scarlet Witch, and she just kinda tossed mofos around. So yeah, it's a toss up favoring Black Panther.&&",2018-10-11 16:50:23
