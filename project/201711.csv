Pixar's Incredibles 2 Trailer,98362,7dtn5i,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJDMWVZta3M,4224,1511019844.0,,"[First poster for Incredibles II](https://i.imgur.com/AHJWaGq.jpg)&&I forgot how much I liked The Incredibles music!&&I have been teased&&It’s all fun and games until Frozone loses his super suit again.&&It is cool how obviously higher quality Mr. Incredible looks. There is way more detail in how his hair is modeled for instance.&&I love seeing visually how much we've progressed technically animation wise when revisiting characters from older films. You wouldn't think the art style from The Incredibles could look better, but even in that short clip you can see how much more detail there is in their designs.&&Oh my god. I'll be there opening day, opening hour, I don't care. I've always thought this is the one movie Pixar made with the MOST sequel potential and I'm so glad they're finally doing it. &&That baby is OP as fuck&&“The teaser trailer for ""Incredibles 2"" is here.

Disney/Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" opens in theatres in 3D June 15th, 2018.

Everyone’s favorite family of superheroes is back in “Incredibles 2” – but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.
 
Directed by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), “Incredibles 2” busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.”&&They just teased me really well. I cannot wait for this movie.

EDIT: [Here is the new Logo.](https://i.imgur.com/24DXz8R.jpg) &&The animation looks so great! And Jack jack is still adorable, and Bob is still hype about his kids' powers. I'm excited!&&Honestly, The Incredibles is still my favorite animated film of all time. I'm skeptical, but at the same time, I can't deny how excited I am to watch this.&&I am so excited for this. The first is one of my favourite Pixar film by a mile and one of my favourite films in general... 

Great little teaser too &&[deleted]&&I'm slightly annoyed by how it's just called ""Incredibles 2"" and not ""The Incredibles 2."" Trailer looks good though!&&If there is not a scene involving even a glimpse of the Underminer, I’ll be partially disappointed.&&THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED!&&Supposedly it’s going to focus more on  Elastigirl and Jack-Jack right? I’m so excited, this was my favorite Pixar flick growing up and I always wanted a trailer since they teased it in the first one. &&Me on opening day:

""Stand back kids, I've waited for this movie for 14 fucking years!""&&Yay! Incrdibles Two, finally.

Little dissapinted we didn’t see more but hey it’s just a teaser.&&Congrats on all the karma you are gonna get&&I would be so happy if this opened with the battle against the underminer, right where we left off 10 years ago.&&WHERE’S MY SUPER SUIT

Cuz I just ruined the one I’m wearing&&I can't be the only one bummed that we won't see Jack Jack as a teen, Dash as a college student, and Violet as a full fledged super hero. Was also slightly hoping other ex-Super's kids get involved too.

Still hyped with my childhood rushing back though&&""13 years have passed, but I do not age. Time has lost its effect on me. Yet the suffering continues...""
-Samurai Jack Jack&&Holy shit, it's fucking **happening,** dude.&&Damn the first movie came out 13 years ago? Both adult and child me are SUPER hyped.&&Oh man, just the MUSIC got me hyped as heck!&&I hope Edna is in it&&*watches the incredibles with my 4 year old daughter for the first time* 
Daughter: i like this movie! 
Me: you know they’re making a second one.
Daughter: when can we see it?
Me: well it doesn’t come out until next year.
Daughter: UGH that’s such a long time
Me: .........
*disappears into thousand yard stare*&&**Me**: Where is my credit card?

**My Wife**: What?

**Me**: WHERE. IS. MY. CREDIT. CARD? WHERE?

**My Wife**: Why do you need to know?

**Me**: I NEED IT!

**My Wife**: Uh-huh.

**Me**: THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR INCREDIBLES 2 IS IN DANGER! YOU TELL ME WHERE MY CREDIT CARD IS, WOMAN! WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD!

**My Wife**: ""Greater good?"" I'm your wife! I am the greatest good you are EVER gonna get!
&&*teaser trailer&&It feels so good to see the Parr family again. &&Even just hearing Bob's voice again makes me so excited.

And that theme! Genuinely the best superhero theme of the 21st century no doubt.&&^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A ^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^^A  ^^^^^^A  ^^^^^A  ^^^^A  ^^^A ^^A ^A A A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A ^^^^^^^^^A ^^^^^^^^A &&Incredible.&&Incredible&&Incredible &&Incredible&&Everyone: “Are we there yet?”

Pixar: “ We get there WHEN WE GET THERE”&&It's.... About.... Fucking...... Time&&And the day just got better&&Besides the Dark Knight Triology, this was honestly my favorite superhero movie after those.


If a children's superhero movie is better than the entire DC lineup, you know you have a problem...&&Does anyone remember the Jack Jack special from the first film? I remember I would watch that on repeat.&&Lots of negative news lately, but at least in this version of reality we get to watch Incredibles 2!&&Oh look, a promising sequel to the best Fantastic Four movie of all time.&&I am going to positively watch the living shit out of this movie the moment it becomes available for my 24 year old ass to watch&&Cannot wait for this. I must have been around 9 or 10 when I saw the first one in the cinema, and I vividly remember just being blown away. It was the first time I was in awe of a movie, and probably influenced my love of movies quite a bit. Please please please don't be another meh pixar sequel &&I was surprised there wouldn't be a time jump with the sequel, but I like the idea of having it with Jack Jack still as a baby. 
They haven't revealed much, so can't say much expect I'm so seeing this, after 14 years we'll finally have a sequel.&&Don't let this distract you from the fact frozone's wife is the greater good.&&I wish this was set more in the future (er, present) though. I was really interested in how 14 years would affect them.&&I love how they're picking up right where they left off, without skipping a beat. I was afraid they'd fast forward a few years to when Jack-Jack is a bit older without showing us how the family deals with his powers.&&He's a jack of all trades. Coincidence?&&Incredible&&Had to check before my hopes got too high.  It's again Written and Directed by [Brad Bird](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083348/?ref_=tt_ov_dr).  The man that was a writer / director for:

The Iron Giant

The Incredibles

Ratatouille&&Real question is will the Underminer be in it?&&It's so good to be back in this world. Even just that music and the red backdrop are enough. Can't believe it's been 13 years already.&&This first movie really thought me the potential hazards of using a cape as a superhero.&&This makes me want to rewatch the original.  I don’t know how they’re going to outdo the first one, it’s honestly probably one of the most perfect animation movies ever made imo.&&the soundtrack is dope...I'm excited for this one...can't wait...&&I dont think ive ever been so hyped in my life. I imagine this is how I would feel if HL3 finally got announced.&&Hell yeah glad I didn't kill my self yesterday &&Is Syndrome going to be in this movie.&&This is going to be my daughters first movie. 100% &&I still think The Incredibles is Pixar's best movie to date. Great story, incredible animation, and a nice mix of humor & pathos. Not saying anything before or since is bad; but nothing has topped Brad Bird's first outing with the company.

So, of course, even this little taste of what's to come has got me excited.&&The best James Bond soundtrack out of all the Bond films.&&You've got one of the best trumpet players alive in Wayne Bergeron playing on that soundtrack. I'm so hyped.&&Michael Giacchino is fantastic. Very glad he'll be back for Incredibles 2!&&The art style and music really reminds me of tf2.&&When [the score swells a 0:26](https://youtu.be/ZJDMWVZta3M?t=25s), I got a huge dose of nostalgia frisson. &&Michael Giacchino is amazing :)&&I have been pleased&&""You tell me where my super suit is, woman! I need it, we're talking about the greater good!""&&We all know that will be a joke in this movie and I will happily laugh at it&&Honestly I can't tell the difference. Anyone have something to compare it to?&&I thought I was the only one who caught that. His head and cheek wrinkles are also way more refined. &&Should Mr. Incredible's hair be invincible to baby's x-rays?

&&Yeah, I was wondering how...different the humans would look. They look a lot less like rubber (Well, I guess excluding Helen eventually?) than way back in 2004. &&All the little details in Mr Incredible were great, the little bags under his eyes, the shading around his arms, the way his clothing moved, we really have progressed a lot.&&Yeah, you can see when Jack Jack was using his laser vision. The particle effects on the ground look amazing.&&The difference between Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 is ridiculous &&It reminds me how back whsn the first Toy Story came out i thought that animation was perfect. But going back if you look closely there were a lot of things that were rushed, for example all the kids that come to Andy's party are clones of Andy.&&I'd be 100% fine with Pixar doing modern-gen HD remakes of their movies&&That's something that I love about the Pixar sequels.&&14 years, goddamn...

But I'd rather have a single quality sequel 14 years in the making than a mediocre spinoff every one or two.&&Can't believe they took this long, honestly. Maybe just trying to nail the perfect script? I'm sure it'll be worth the wait &&Incredibles 5 will be about Jack Jack living alone in a cheap apartment waiting for the one worthy enemy that he doesn't kill with one look. Basically the Hollywood adaption of One Punch Man.

[Edit] Spelling.
&&Disney please nerf&&The real mvp is the babysitter who managed to survive that baby. &&Nerf the baby's rez to single target with a high casting time.&&Thank you for purchasing The Incredibles (2004). Jack Jack will be unlocked in 14 years&&He's the Wabbajack. &&I hope that baby grows up to be a conflicted character. The ban on superheros is never lifted and his family is hunted down one by one and killed in various ways that their powers couldnt save them until Jack Jack is the only one left.

He sharpens his skills and goes after the government who killed his family. The movie becomes a bloody revenge story with JJ raging against his opponents and killing them in merciless ways.

The story is all dark and violent. A far cry from the family friendly origins of the first film.&&It’s like a law that super babies are op

From Franklin Richards to Legion to Jack Jack, this is like a given. &&Boss baby?&&[removed]&&That is such a nothing description, but they're clearly keeping everything fairly quiet.&&Interesting that this seems to take place really soon after the first movie. I don't know why, but I was under the impression they would have some kind of time skip.&&There’s something about holly hunters voice that makes the clock on my southern Louisiana porch go from 6 to 12&&Seems it's following the standard of other Pixar sequels/prequels where they switch the main focus to the supporting character. I can't fucking wait&&""Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so...""&&Hey, come on, they're super heroes. What could happen?&&Considering how many of those people worked on the original movie, I've actually got some high hopes that this will be pretty awesome! (Plus the fact that, of the major Disney/Pixar movies that have gotten theater-release sequels--Toy Story, Cars, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo--the majority have been off-the-charts awesome. Cars 2 is the exception.) &&This gives nothing away but I'm super excited for this movie :)&&Did someone say Frozone?

**HONEY!! WHERE IS MY SUPERSUIT???**&&> the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson)

Incredibles 1 - 2004

Iron Man - 2008

A) the Marvel cinematic universe, which largely defines the modern era of superhero films, has come up entirely after the Incredibles came out.  There is SO MUCH new material to be parodied, played with, etc.  This film is going to be amazing.

B) If there isn't a single Nick Fury reference or joke somewhere, given that Sam Jackson is returning, I will demand a refund for my ticket.&&Up there with the original teaser of Mr Incredible trying to fit his belt on.&&My favourite movie of all time is getting a sequel! 

I COULD NOT BE MORE HYPED ABOUT THIS&&[removed]&&My facts are probably way off, but didn’t Brad bird say he wasn’t going to do the incredibles until they could put together a script he liked? I’m pretty sure they didn’t want to force a new movie for the sake of a new movie, and if that’s the case, I’m gonna dash to the theatre on opening day. &&The first one was perfect, and I trust that Bird will be able to do it again&&Nah fam it's obviously gonna be the Teen Titans Go movie&&2 In 2 Credibles

Edit: or Incredibles 2: Elastigirl Boogaloo&&I guess it's like the change between ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2""&&In an interview with John Lasseter, he said it takes place right where the first film ended off &&Love how that kid was just there randomly&&IT WAS SOMETHING AMAZING ^^I ^^guess...&&Outside of jack jack the family’s screen time was pretty balanced in the second and third acts...&&I DID MY WAITING

14 YEARS OF IT

IN AZKABAN&&Are we the Youtube comments section now?&&Wow. Thanks for making me feel old. 

""Hey, move aside, kids! I've been waiting for this sequel since before you were born!""&&I'm sharing your excitement, but I actually loved that they kept the teaser so short. I feel like teasers have basically become a synonym for trailer lately, and it felt great to just get that dirty no shame tease for a movie again. In my opinion this is a teaser done right.&&[removed]&&They covered that in the videogame, Rise of the Underminer. It was pretty good from what I can remember!&&It will be.&&I feel like I heard somewhere that is the case.
&&This could very easily be just a teaser that had nothing to do with the actual story or maybe a flashback.&&what makes you think we won't? the incredibles started in the past, this one might too.&&I could swear I've read somewhere that they start right there where the first one ended.&&I know right, I wanted a Toy Story 3 time skip.&&""Hello, darkness my old friend...""&&_the greater good_&&MY EVENINGS IN DANGER&&_the greater good_&&Me too. I was also one of those few on Reddit and /r/movies who went, ""please, *don't* let them be aged up"".&&Supposedly it's picking up immediately where the first one left off. &&Nah he's dead. Tony Rydinger is his apprentice tho don't @ me&&The best Bond film without Bond in it.&&Forgetting about Snake Eater...&&When I saw the first one in theaters I literally thought John Barry had done the score. This is what put Michael Giacchino on my radar and I’ve been a huge fan ever since. Really excited to have another Incredibles score from him.&&As a trumpet player myself the most exciting thing about this movie is gonna be the soundtrack lmao. &&Wayne Bergeron is one of the living Jazz Trumpet Goats along with Wynton Marsalis and Nicholas Payton.&&I got to meet him last February, super nice guy. And this summer I got to play his music, including The Incredibles, with my community band. Really looking forward to the movie, and the soundtrack.&&One of the greats. Up there with Williams and Zimmer&&Ah that's so true, they're really oddly similar&&It is the other way around, Valve took inspiration from the Incredibles for the game style.&&My instant flashback was [No One Lives Forever 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Lives_Forever_2:_A_Spy_in_H.A.R.M.%27s_Way)&&Both were flat in design before flat was cool again. Great connection. &&TF2 got is inspiration from the first Incredible movie.&&or the other way round...&&It's that 60s retrofuturistic style

Edit: check this out if you like the style of music

http://somafm.com/secretagent/

I also like skeewiff's style of new age 60s jazz&&Upvote for frisson.&&Damn Right. I couldn't have hummed the melody of the incredibles theme if you asked me 5 minutes ago, but the second that swell hits, I was right there with it &&_the greater good_&&Here's some hair renders.

The movie was subtly teased in this article too https://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixars-renderman-marschner-hair/&&Here, check out the teaser trailer for the [first movie](https://youtu.be/Jd1bwuS4oQc).&&Take a look at the sceene when [jack is burning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDRLa4AjbsU) in the first movie. 

now compare that to the short moment he burns in the teaser. its a huge difference. 

the movie is made intentionally to look like the old one. so you are not going to see much difference in the hair. aside from maybe looking slightly better in the wind. but complex effects like you see in the teaser you can expect to see far more of.



&&Can Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that even he can't eat it?&&Mr. Incredible isn't completely indestructible. He gets cut by the small robit in the first film.

Plus Superman shaves with his heat vision/laser eyes. It's not unwarranted that the logic apply here as well.&&[removed]&&[Subsurface Scattering](https://www.google.ca/search?q=subsurface+scattering) - looks like they really improved in that regard&&I remember watching the first one in the theater and being amazed that on a close up, you could see the weave of fabric on the shirt he was wearing. &&Yeah I'm gonna reserve judgement until they put in a fps counter.&&I actually know the guy who draws a lot of Disney’s sparkles/particles. He’s old school so he prefers to hand animate everything. I know he did all of tinkerbell so if you want to check out his work just rewatch Peter Pan. Maybe I can get him to do an ama.&&Even 1 and 2 has a crazy difference &&The baby in Tin Toy still gives me nightmares, and even that was a revolutionary step in computer animation.&&Too late... *14 years too late*

Edit: Gold? Never heard that one before&&And consider - it's a film that's largely a love letter and parody of superhero films.  Think about what's happened in terms of superhero films in the past 14 years.  Hint - Iron Man came out in 2008.&&It was almost ""15 years too late.""&&Brad Bird has said repeatedly that he wouldn’t do another Incredibles movie unless he had a really, really awesome story. He’s not as into making it a Cars franchise. &&Brad Bird has repeatedly said he wasn't going to do an Incredibles 2 unless he had a good script.&&[deleted]&&I can't wait to hear who they cast as Genos&&I think Hollywood already made a One Punch Man adaption. It stars Will Smith and is called Hancock. &&""You needed worthy opponents""&&Incredibles 2: Patch 
 
Summer 2020 &&They'll remove him from the film due to backlash then add him back at a later date.&&~~Kori~~ Kari is a real champ, unlocking his powers using Mozart and learning to deal with all his powers in a day. Too bad she won't remember any of it.&&You all should watch the short story about it, i believe it's called Jack Jack atack&&Have Mercy.&&RIP Mercy mains&&Has it really been that long???&&Or you can purchase it with $1000 for some sense of pride and accomplishment.&&The WabbaJackJack.&&Something tells me my baby cousin isn't going to ask me to put this movie on 24/7 repeat like Moana&&I would like to subscribe to your news letter.&&Can’t wait for him to go all “one batch, two batch”&&honestly a far cry from literally anything brad bird’s made lol&&The fist film may be family friendly, but still deals in pretty ""adult"" subjects, like adultery and midlife crisis, and got a lot of praise for it.

So I hope this movie will keep to tradition&&Then when he's the only one left he goes Super Saiyan and goes back in time to save Goku. &&I make that same expression at my baby everyday.&&He looks tired.&&[deleted]&&There’s more info in that description than there is in the trailer.

At least the description tells us that there will be a plot element where Helen works outside of the house and Bob has to get used to staying at home and raising the kids.

All the trailer tells us is that Jack Jack has super powers, which is something we already learned in the last movie.&&I feel like they avoided the time skip because Jack Jack as a teenager, or even like a 8 year old could probably take down any antagonist in 20 minutes.&&Me too especially as it's been like 13 years since the first one. A whole baby that was born on the release date of the first movie has grown up to be a teenager &&I think a lot of people were really hoping they were going to pull a Toy Story and have the characters age with the audience. I'm one of them. I won't lie, I'm a little disappointed...&&she's bona fide &&She reminds me of Jodie Foster. She's got that ""shosher"" voice where everytime she says a word with the letter 's' it sounds kinda funny. Imagine Holly Hunter saying ""Mr Lector"".&&It’s funny, actually. I had never thought about her voice much, or really even given that much thought about Holly Hunter as an actress.

But after the Incredibles? I can pick her voice out in an instant from anything and yes, I do find it to be strangely...um. Soothing. Yes, we’ll go with that. Soothing.&&> the clock on my southern Louisiana porch

As some one from Louisiana, I am definitely using this now&&Daaaaaaa daaa daaaaaaaa&&Cars is the Black sheep of Pixar, they made a sequel because they sold a hella lot of merchandise, a scaled down minions.  
But yes you're right, the sequels were almost always as good as the first &&I almost forgot about that one. It was iconic&&The best Fantastic 4 movie ever!&&If i remember correctly around the time of the first the director said the reason jack jack had such a cluster of powers was due to ""him being a baby and so can grow to become anything"" (likely paraphrasing) if that's the case then your theory would likely be right.  
Side note, all of the other family members powers are based around their personalities or roles in the family dynamic.
Edit: Spelling&&I always assumed he was a shape-shifter. The laser eyes throws a bit of a wrench in that though&&That is correct. If they wanted to cash in on the money, this movie would have been made a long time ago. Pixar knows how beloved the first movie is and how much of a demand there has been for a sequel since the first. &&I would agree with you, but Pixar did make Cars 3 as a shameless cash grab. I have faith in Bird, though.&&>I'm gonna dash to the theatre

I see what you did there&&Until *he* could put together a script he liked. He wrote the movie.&&This is fact. Unlike, Finding Dory (which Andrew Stanton decided to make in a relatively quick production cycle relative to other Pixar films, after his plans for a John Carter franchise got scrapped) , Incredibles 2 has come after a long time of planning and preparation to deliver a great story. Same was done for Toy Story 3, they waited so long because they felt they should only deliver a sequel that was on par if not better than the first 2.

I'm excited, and I'm sure Incredibles 2 will be.........


......incredible.&&So that's it huh? We're some kinda 2 in 2 Credibles?&&2 incredibles 4 me&&Or The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron &&Shit.  That got sirius.&&/r/unexpectedhogwarts&&I remember as a kid I played through the second game with a friend (right after finishing the first) and for years I told people what the sequel to the Incredibles was about, but no one would believe me and just told me there wasn't a second movie, wasn't until years after that I realized there actually never was a second movie, only a game.. UNTIL NOW&&As long as Edna gets a healthy dose of screen time I’ll be more than happy, they could age up the other characters but for some reason I feel like Edna doesn’t age. &&No, they are definitely kids in the film. The description (linked in an above comment) confirms it.&&Oh, good point.

You can have a model as complex as you'd like, but if the light isn't handled right it'll just look like a very detailed plastic model.&&interesting, never noticed it. But in general every Pixar film (so far) sorta evolved around new 3D and render technologies, and the ""fabric film"" was Ratatouille. For The Incredibles it was hair and skin.&&I think pixars render time is around 29hrs per frame.
You can add your own counter by taping 00fps to the screen&&Come on now, it's a movie, so gotta go for that cinematic 30 fps.&&Yeah, I'm sick and tired of companies misleading us with this pre-rendered bullshot.&&Yeah. Toy Story holds up pretty well overall despite the simpler animation (compared to today), and then the dog and the baby show up and suddenly it becomes blindingly clear why they chose to make their first movie about plastic toys: **because everything looked like plastic toys back then**.&&Well when everyone's got a sequel...

no one has.&&That's... Brilliant.&&They should’ve waited 1 more year for it to line up with the movie &&Kinda like KH3&&Buddy...?&&An Incredibles Cinematic Universe wouldn't be too bad of an idea. Like, not more Incredibles sequels but have a Frozone solo movie and expand with characters introduced in that.&&At this point they should have just waited a year for the sake of that joke.&&I kinda hope the movie gets delayed one year just so we can say this.&&That's when you see it on DVD&&Danny Devito&&Incredibles 2 Update for 12/08/2020 (18:56:07 UTC+0):

&&Norman&&Wait... Incredibles was released in 2004..?&&_the greater good_&&On the special features for the first Incredibles, they talk about how cutting edge Violet's hair was at the time. If you watch the movie, she's basically the only person who doesn't have helmet hair. Shoot, I'm pretty sure that was one of the big reasons that contributed to the James Bond 70s aesthetic. Big stiff hair was easy to animate in their first movie featuring actual adult humans.

You could basically watch Pixar's development in animation based on how much hair they had in the movie. The really early stuff didn't even feature *humans.* You had lamps (Luxo Jr) and bugs (Bug's Life) and small toys (Tin Toy, Knick Knack and Toy Story). Things with few moving parts that looking plastic didn't hurt. And if they needed someone with hair like say, Andy, his mom or his little sister, they found ways around it. Which is why Andy wears a hat. His sister has really thick curls. Andy's mom has a ponytail and most of her action is done off screen.

They made 6 whole movies (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Bug's Life, Monster's Inc, and Finding Nemo) before they started to really have humans because hair is so fucking hard to animate. There's a reason that so many video games have characters with short hair. Shit is just easier and more reliable than something that moves around.

I remember when Incredibles came out, Violet's hair didn't look *great* but it still looked damn good. I mean, it all looks pretty dated [now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ6KomTg56o) sure. But at the time it was pretty impressive. You just didn't have hair like that in movies or games.

You can see it getting a little better in each movie they did after that. [Ratatouille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YG4h5GbTqU) had someone with shoulder length hair that didn't look quite as greasy. 

And [Brave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbxhKTbTkA) experimented with a bit of frizz. Which let stuff move around but you didn't have to worry about it doing weird stuff because it was stiff.

With [Inside Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4okAfKCwRk), they had people with actual hair people would wear and it wasn't held down by a fuckton of hairspray. Modern and contemporary with appropriate lengths.&&Another example is that the wrinkles in the face are much more detailed in the new trailer &&Everyone keeps talking up the quality, my 1 Meg dsl connection is playing both on 320p :(&&Hard to say. Not only are these trailers, the other one is much older and in a worse resolution. 

Meanwhile the newer trailer, hair aside, is much more crisp the way you expect modern animation to look like. 

The effects, the fire, all that stuff looks better. Though after the first 20 minutes of either movie, all this kind of stuff becomes mere background. &&And suddenly, Toy Story!&&Damn. I remember Carmack doing a presentation I think like 20 years ago about the future of game engines and his main point was all these polygons mean nothing if the light doesn’t behave correctly. &&Playing Senua's Sacrifice and that's really the only key indicator in some scenes that it's animated&&I think Monster's Inc. was hair, when they had to render Sully&&[deleted]&&Just piggybacking on this but Pixar has a fucking CRAZY research division.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mJ4dpNal_k&&There really isn't a *known genre name* as far as I can tell, *BUT* your best bet is to actually search for stock/production music that originates from the era. Stock/production music companies hold vast libraries of songs from many artists and they sell the rights to movies, television shows, commercials, video games, music soundtracks, etc. Honestly one of the best bets to check out is either the Ren & Stimpy Production Music or the Spongebob Squarepants Production Music soundtracks as both (Especially the former) takes a lot of older production songs from the 40s, 50s, and 60s and uses them as background songs in their cartoon and a lot of them hit what you are looking for. Here are some examples:

Ralph Dollimore composed [Hit and Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z95GuU-uLtI). Kenny Graham composed [The Hurry Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJOKrGJDto0). Roberty Early composed [First Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM4uqBcylF8). If you have a Spotify account, one of your best bets actually is to search up for either [KPM](https://open.spotify.com/search/albums/kpm) or [APM](https://open.spotify.com/search/albums/apm) albums. KPM and APM are production music companies and you have certainly heard some of their musical selections before, such as [The Lineman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQDTKPbwxUw) and [Horlepiep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-yAMfNT2mk) came from the APM Music Library I believe. If you want the best results however, your best bet is to actually peruse the actiam [APM Music Library](https://www.apmmusic.com/libraries/kpm-music) where they have their entire library of canned production music for production companies. For instance under the search bar if you check ""Track Title"" and then search up ""Oyster Girls"" you will hear [another familiar tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3bTi4BrjZM). You just gotta search the right albums and the right tags to find that musical genre you desire.

You can also look back in time to songs that also played in the media at the time, such as the [M Squad Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAhXez5Ib2k) (Which would of course go on to influence the [Police Squad Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Lzpz-Emhs)) or even looking into the soundtracks of the [older James Bond films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8KvYKn9-0), the [original Mission Impossible theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QlplayAjM4), or the [original Hawaii Five-O theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7PUbWPRLIg) too to see if you harbor any results.&&It's influenced a lot by Big Band from what I can tell. 

Check this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mJ4dpNal_k&&The whole soundtrack of the first film was composed and performed by Gordon Goodwon's Big Phat Band. I had the pleasure of meeting him years ago.

^^/s&&I expect that the difference will be in the details of the world more than the characters, since they are purposefully simplified.&&Look, Pixar weren’t dummies. In the early days of primitive computer animation tools, they made movies about plastic/exoskeleton characters like toys and bugs.&&Oh boy the [scene](https://youtu.be/6QgZoMR7ofs)  where Woody is restored in TS2 is one of my favorite Pixar moments. So satisfying &&Yeah, these days polycount is really not at all important, from a visual and optimisation standpoint. The large chunk of your render time will be from the shading, and a higher or lower polycount is not really going to affect that as much anymore. These days the render time for a 10,000 tri model vs a 20,000 tri model is so insignificant, while the detail bonus is massive that it's not as big of a deal anymore. It's still going to be baked down and optimised (because why not have extra detail, normal maps are basically free), but not as aggressively.&&Curly hair was Brave&&Iirc they had to make an engine to deal with Violets hair?

Also, the kid's names are connected with their powers. I don't need to explain Dash.

I also got to see Henri Mancini conduct the Boston Pops Orchestra a long time ago when I was a kid when they played the July 4th concert in downtown Boston.  Although I was in band classes at school at the time and had heard the name Henry Mancini, I just didn't know enough about him to appreciate just how amazing that moment actually was for me to be there in person.

This would do it.&&[It looks like they're actually calling it ""Untitled Deadpool Sequel""](https://www.foxmovies.com/movies/deadpool-2)&&[deleted]&&Nice way to start a Wednesday my dudes.&&Hm. One of the top threads on /r/OutOfTheLoop is ['Who's Bob Ross and why is Reddit obsessed with him?'](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7czw77/whos_bob_ross_and_why_is_reddit_obsessed_with_him/), submitted yesterday. 

Today, a movie teaser in the form of a Bob Ross parody.

It's almost as if viral marketers were worried the younger crowd wouldn't get the references, and wanted to prime the audience before releasing the teaser...&&[We did it red dit!](https://imgur.com/a/6A6jh) &&Y’all like references?&&I'm so glad Bob Ross has taken off.  I watched him all the time as a kid, and I was super stoked when twitch did the marathon (was that two years ago already?!).  I remember my gf came over while I had it on and at first she was all wtf is this.   Then she watched an episode and fell in love.  We don't deserve Bob and he is a fantastic human being.&&This trailer is fucking perfect.  I've had a huge grin on my face for the past 30mins.&&HOLD ON TO YOUR BUTTS&&Really excited to see where their media guys go with this movie. Deadpool had some of the best, most irreverent, and on-point (in terms of subject matter) ads and marketing campaigns I think movies in general, have ever seen. Even if you had NO CLUE who or what Deadpool was, I'm sure lots of people felt compelled to research it and the fans who know and love the goofy bastard just got to enjoy the madness inflicted onto the world.&&> Deadpool dressed as Bob Ross for a trailer

And people say Rick and Morty is reddit incarnate.&&I enjoyed Mennen Black. So simple. &&Camera 1, camera 2. Camera 1, camera 2&&When I was 14, I was very sheltered and a follower of Bob Ross. I announced to my art class that I loved wet on wet technique. And that is the story of how I came out 10 years before I came out.&&r/restofthefuckingowl&&""Beat it like it owes you money"" LOL&&Dayvin Ross would be proud.. and maybe a little pissed.   

https://youtu.be/mpDOVajzlV4&&> Red dit

my favorite color&&The timing on this teaser is incredible.  I woke up this morning to an unrelated reddit post about Bob Ross which lead me to watch an entire episode of joy of painting for the first time in like two decades.  And then this post... awesome.

Edit:  This was the post that I started my day with: https://redd.it/7czw77. 
&&I should watch the first Deadpool shouldnt i.. &&God this is so painfully targeted at redditors&&Holy fuck knuckles!&&Didn't know I needed to see Deadpool as Bob Ross in my life.

Good theme for a thread somewhere?

&&I call time travel!&&Honestly I think Deadpool has been mashed with just about everyone by now.&&Holy fuck knuckles, I’m high as a kite right now.&&This is as good as the Australia Day promo from the first movie

Edit: https://youtu.be/vv05IIPRY6Y&&Now I want to see the cast of Justice League doing paint night. &&I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it, I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.&&Let's just call it a happy little accident. &&I imagine that if you're in Marketing in Hollywood, having creative freedom to do unique stuff like this is far more stimulating than coming up with 5 different ways of spoiling a movie using a 3 minute trailer.&&Plus Ryan Reynold's perfect delivery. &&Everything about Deadpool is a sandbox where the potential to do anything and everything exists. It must be so liberating for everyone involved with the franchise to have that much leash to do whatever the fuck they want. 

It's hard to fuck up provided they keep it  fun, stay true to the character and, when in doubt, steer into the skid. &&A 5yo drawing of a ~~spiderma~~ deadpool mask&&Yeah. I'm hoping for an answer to that as well.&&My favorite is Mennin Black.

WE EATIN' FAM&&I don't think I'm ready to hear Seth Rogen's laugh come out of Pumba&&[removed]&&John Oliver as Zazu is insanely perfect. Hell, he looks exactly how a human version of Zazu would look like.&&Yeah, that cast is insane.

Plus, Eric Andre in anything is a win in my book.&&Disney is making a movie featuring both Beyoncé and Eric Andre.

Ok, I'm not really crazy about Disney's remake obsession, but honestly this cast is amazing.&&I saw this on facebook, and assumed it was someone's dream cast for an eventual lion king movie. Then I saw Beyonce posted it herself. Wtf. This cast seems so good.&&Really disappointed that Jeremy Irons is not returning as Scar.

His performance is iconic. &&I love the Lion King and This does look pretty interesting - and certainly has an amazing cast, but I am kind of in the “feels unnecessary” camp since it will be 100% CGI anyway. I actually really really loved The Jungle Book remake and I know Jon Favreau will do a great job. But the difference between that and this is that for The Jungle Book, there was a book to grab additional material from, The Lion King was an original story  (granted I know it was pretty derivative). There’s not much more material to explore there. I’m sure i’ll see it and enjoy it though. Lion King was *my* movie as a 90 kid.&&But... I want Jeremy Irons :(&&Jesus this is **stacked**! Holy crap, does this mean Beyonce and Childish Gambino are gonna have a song together!? &&They got it right the first time. &&Im glad James Earl Jones is there but equally dissapointed that Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane and Rowan Atkinson won't be reprising their roles.&&I love that James Earl Jones is still Mufasa. He’s the only one that could pull it off.&&Hhhhuuuuhhhhh huhuuhhhhhh hahaha haaakuuuuuuna mmmhuuuuhhhhhhhuuhhuhhuhuhuhuhhhhuhuhuhtata /SethRogenBreathyMumble&&Jeremy Irons is my scar :(&&I’m not sure I can get on board with a different voice for Scar. To me, Jeremy irons nailed it. &&Not to be a drag, but  Nathan Lane not reprising his role as Timon is criminal &&I was honestly surprised about Beyonce, had not heard that&&Jeremy irons where are you :(&&Holy shit Donald Glover is taking over the world.  Who would have known watching Bro Rape that we would be here today. &&But y tho?&&How many times will Zazu yell ""literally"" during a monologue?&&You thought the Beauty and the Beast remake was unnecessary? Hold my beer. &&Everyone forgets Beyonce suuuuuuucks at acting though. Hopefully her role will be minimal. &&Seth Rogen as Pumbaa is the most perfect casting I've ever seen.&&I'm sorry but isn't it a little ridiculous that hollywood is so devoid of ideas they're actually remaking an animated movie that's only separate by (barely) a single generation? The cast looks great, but it's frivolous and seems like a cash grab.&&I don't know if I like Chiwetel Ejiofor (did I get that right?) as Scar. His voice isn't menacing enough&&That's right fuckers. No one can play Mufasa but the king himself. &&H. Jon Benjamin would be a better Pumba than Seth Rogen, imo.&&I was really hoping for Charlie Day and Danny Devito to voice Timon and Pumbaa. &&Why can't they just cast real voice actors instead of famous people? What is even the point. Makes the VA work a lot worse and probably costs tons of money&&Beyonce as Nala, really? They couldn't have picked someone who could actually act? Stoked about Donald Glover though. That boy needs to be in more stuff. &&I'm going to get down voted to oblivion for this, but I just have no interest in seeing this film. 

It's like  covering a song by the Beatles: it's already fantastic you know? Why make another version? 

Sorry if I'm raining on the parade, but I just wanted to throw my two cents in to see if there was anyone else who shared the same opinion. 

Edit: OKAY so MAYBE there are good Beatles covers out there, but you know what I mean (Joe Cocker's ""I get by with a little help from my friends"" being a favorite of mind). Also surprised by the up votes instead of down votes. Glad I'm not the only one in here. 
&&Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Miss Carter!&&I don't understand they're remaking it? I never heard about this. 

Edit: someone gave me more info...I don't really like that idea. Why not just make NEW classics for this generations kids? I thought their new franchises were making a killing?&&The whole first half of the movie would sound like Redbone&&Honestly, it's not like he went through puberty between Community and becoming Childish Gambino, he can go back to that voice and I can hear Troy being young Simba.&&I was really looking forward to his version of I Just Can't Wait to Be King&&Disney locked that room down lol.&&They showed us the opening at D23.  Fucking epic.  Sent chills down my spine.  Could have just been the opening song though but still&&Just Mufasa. 

James Earl Jones is all you really need in life, though.&&I kinda wish they still had Nathan Lane and Jeremy Irons.

I just went from hyped to massively disappointed :(&&Hannibal Buress is waaaaay too chill to play a hyena.

On an unrelated point, never in a hundred years would I have predicted that Eric Andre would be cashing checks from Disney.&&What I'm wondering is why they decided to change the names of the Hyenas except for Shenzi?

They should have just left it as Banzai and Ed.
&&The Lion King is still by far his greatest in my opinion&&This is honestly the only thing I needed to hear regarding this movie. That score is magical!&&It's a nearly shot-for-shot remake. It's being dubbed as ""live action"" but is CGI animated, just Jungle Book style.

This remake is pointless, but the soundtrack will be great. Except for Hakuna Matata, because who wants to hear Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner sing.&&Seriously. Next two James Earl Jones, he has the most iconic voice in this. Hard to imagine scar voiced by anyone else

General Disney franchise pattern. &&Eric has interviewed Beyoncé before on his tv show with Jay-Z so it’s cool to see them together again &&But why is Whoopi not reprising her role?&&I like Beyonce as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure why she's in this beyond that she's a pop star.

I'd have cast someone like Tessa Thompson. I can see her playing up Nala's sarcastic sassiness really well. &&[You have no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTFflehHtvI).&&Jeremy Iron’s voice as Scar gave me some very complicated feelings as a tween. I will definitely miss it in this version.&&Can’t decide who’s more iconic in the role. Irons as Scar or James Woods as Hades. I know this is a LK thread by James woods’ hades might be my favorite Disney character ever&&I also fully expect this movie to follow the original beat by beat like Beauty and the Beast did. That movie also had zero reason to exist other than to exploit nostalgia and make money. There’s literally nothing new that a remake of Lion King will do other than use CGI that will eventually look dated. At least Jungle Book did something new with its story compared to the original movie. &&and Robert Guillaume..   ;_;&&too white lol&&The musical potential from those two leads has gotta result in at least a few songs.&&Why do you think Beyonce was cast? There's no such thing as a guarantee, but letting Beyonce sing in your Disney movie is the closest you can get to creating the next ""Let it Go"". Disney has recognized the power of a hit song for decades. Think of all the most iconic animated films. Jungle Book (Bare Necessities), Lion King (Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata), Aladdin (A Whole New World), Little Mermaid (Under the Sea), etc etc....Beyonce was brought on because she's a safe bet to satisfy that part of the Disney formula. &&It took a long time for me to understand what the fuck you were saying but I fucking lost it&&Seth Rogen yet again cast as the fat, hippie, possibly stoner (those hallucinogenic bugs maaaan!) with his skinny best friend.&&The fact they're remaking these at all is criminal.&&He's helping Batman right now. &&Mystery Team is my favorite dumb movie &&$$$&&And voice acting.

They distributed opaque bags for everyone to seal their phones in for the duration of the presentation. Security was watching like a hawk when they were playing clips and would handle anyone that was secretly recording or had their phone out of the bag.&&I worked briefly with a company who did Disney's premiers in Hollywood. They had very strict guidelines unlike anything I've ever seen. There were very detailed inspections of the theater for hidden devices that may be streaming or recording. (Rumor was they'd plant one of their own to see if you found it.)

There was also private security staff in the theater during the entire movie with devices to detect the use of recording equipment. Disney seriously doesn't fuck around with their security contracts.

(Aladdin was the real kick started) &&He did an audiobook of the entire Bible, once.&&Yeah.  Some actors just aren't suited for some roles, and voice acting isn't any easier just because no one sees you.  They are radically different; as a physical actor your main challenge is coordinating all the ways in which you can communicate your role.  To some extent, this is more natural as you just have to act as a human.  With VO, you are putting a voice to a body that you have no control on how it ends up looking, and to do good VO, you have to put emphasis on how you speak in a somewhat unnatural way because you have no control on facial expressions and other nonverbal ways of communicating.  

Of course, at the end of the day, it's a remake of a famous movie so of course it's just one big cash grab.  The cast list is more of an advertisement for the movie rather than an announcement in itself.  With a cast like this, it would be hard for this to fail, but it's clear that the cast wasn't chosen based on picking the most capable person for each role.  &&One more for Shaft, please.&&But do you remember...

Is that considering the actors even though they haven't cast? &&[removed]&&Tarantino dialogue about someone trying to start a race war? The N-word count will be through the roof.

Wonder who Tarantino is going to play.&&All I want to know is who the fuck Samuel L Jackson is playing in a movie about a whole bunch of white psychopaths&&[deleted]&&I wonder if it's awkward being a famous director directing a movie about how another famous directors wife being brutally murdered.&&The script is now officially finished. It will be his first film without Harvey Weinstein (TWC & Miramax). We should get casting & studio news very soon.

**Description:**

Currently being referred to as “#9,” first broke over the summer when it was revealed he was putting together a script based on the Manson Family murders. Deadline reports that the script hews closely to “Pulp Fiction.” One of the stories is expected to focus on Sharon Tate, a role that has been reportedly offered to Margot Robbie.&&Danny Devito as Charles Manson.&&[Walton Goggings](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYyNmUwMmItYzE4YS00ZTQxLWJiNjUtNzA0OGIzZGYzNDk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg4OTQzNjg@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) as [Charles Manson](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Charles-mansonbookingphoto.jpg), calling it now. Dude was born for this role.&&I'm so glad he hasn't flashed his penis or grabbed ass at anyone in the last 40 years ....&&[removed]&&Now he just needs a distributor&&I'm going to guess Charles manson dies in some spectacular way
 &&They should keep the title as #9. Manson used The Beatles' White Album as evidence that a race war was coming and that The Beatles gave a fuck about the Manson family. Revolution 9 repeatedly says ""Number 9"" and that'd just be neat if he stayed with the #9 title.&&Only one more Quentin movie after this! Say it ain’t so. 
https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/quentin-tarantino-ten-movies-retirement&&Like the Hateful 8, it seems that Tarantino has picked the subject to match what number of movie it is for him. The Manson Family was responsible for 9 murders.&&I don't think Manson will be the main character. He will be sort of a Hitler in Inglorious Basterds type of character, few lines but present. The people around his life will get the most focus i think. &&Walton Goggins as Manson please!!&&I think the big question here is, who will Samuel L Jackson play?&&I'm skeptical that the classic Tarantino-film DNA would really work with a story about the Manson Family Murders. 

Writing and filming fictional spaghetti westerns and re-imaginings of history in his signature style is one thing... doing the same with horrific and creepy cult-murders where the killers are still alive is another.

Perhaps he'll know this though when making it.&&Mark Hamill would be a perfect older Charles Manson&&with all the violence going on in the world... do we really need ANOTHER movie ALL ABOUT KILLING???

.... oh wait you said Tarantino?... shiet l'm taking the wife and the kids with me opening night&&Anyone else sees the picture of a director and instantly assumes that its about them being sex offender before reading the title?&&im still bummed that we aren't getting the vega brothers movie&&I really hope it ends with Sharon Tate killing Manson &&the n-word is still going to be in about 90% of the dialogue.&&Who has money on Samuel L Jackson playing Charlie Manson? You might laugh at first, but ask yourself ""Would QT do that?"" You know he would.&&He is starting to look like he isn’t actually aging but is having Hollywood makeup artists “age” him with makeup and prosthetics so people don’t ask questions. &&He'll get one in a matter of days Im sure

World War II/Nazis (w swastikas carved in their heads like Manson), Slavery, Civil War

Its exactly the kind of film he'd want to do. Plus that time period is his favorite: the start of the 70s.

I can see the entire film revolving around the murders which take place at  the end of the movie or arent shown at all, in classic QT style&&I really hope that Tarantino's cameo is as Polanski.&&after watching Good Time, I'll be extremely disappointed if Robert Pattinson isn't Charles Manson. He'd be fucking perfect for it&&Alright, everyone. No leaks this time - I want the original story.&&So when's quentin's sci fi movie coming?&&Oh good.  I can't wait to see a movie about Roman Polanski's house guests delivering extensive monologues before beating the Manson family to death.&&I'm sure anyone in the world would take a paycut to work with him. Maybe not Tom Cruise.&&Many actors take a pay cut to worl wiyh him, Scorsese and a few others. It gibes you credit and hype worth more than money. Can lift a career up.

My guess would be they're just aiming high since it's an interesting concept. With 60s music licensing costs as well. Beatles and Beach Boys I assume. &&Yes, likely the actors will be given 'points on the backend' so when the movie makes the money at the box office and then start selling DVDs and digital copies they will earn money off of that too. &&He's holding out to do the live action Mulan.

EDIT, since the comment above was deleted: They said something about with Disney not in contention, there go their dreams of a Tarantino Disney R-Rated film.&&But... Miramax was a was a Disney subsidiary when they distributed 'Pulp Fiction'...&&Which hard R are they referring to?&&He was pretty pissed at them after Hateful 8 got booted from that one theater for Star Wars anyway. That's not to say that they could never work together again, but Tarantino seems like the kind of guy to hold a grudge to me.&&Disney owns tons of subsidiaries that produce porn...&&Tarantino stuns Hollywood when he casts himself, not Margot Robbie, as the late Sharon Tate.&&Helter Skelter motherfuckaaaa&&Spike Lee just had an aneurysm. &&If it's anything like his other appearances in django,  pulp fiction or reservoir dogs. He'll play a background character who comes in for 2 scenes to says something racist. &&Constant music✔️

I was pretty surprised to find out that Charles Manson is only 5’2. &&I’m down for more Walton Goggins in anything. 

EDIT: Yes I’ve seen Vice Principals. It’s amazing. He’s the best part of that show. 

EDIT 2: Haven’t seen Justified, heard great things. &&Anybody else would be a disappointment now that you've fed my brain this possibility.&&I would love for an amazing role like this to push Walton over the hump into A-lister. &&I don't think I've seen him in anything except the Hateful Eight and Vice Principals, but he's my favorite actor in VP. &&Yeah this is a no-brainer.&&I love it. Saving this comment for when you are hopefully proven correct.&&Yeah he's just a dude who likes to fuck feet. I'm cool with that.&&...that we know of yet.&&This made me laugh hard&&Actually this wouldn’t be out of character at all since Manson was a pretty clear racist and advocated a coming race war. &&On a side note, I'm guessing we're getting a lot of Beatles music &&They're going to be fighting over him.&&All the majors are reading it this week and making offers after that (except Disney, they don't do R-rated blood fests), so this may come together pretty quickly.&&Was he with Weinstein?&&>  Now he just needs a distributer 

Wow. Didn't think of this. I can't imagine the offers he'll receive &&And now we know what role Samuel will have.&&Sharon Tate survives the attack and comes back for her killers, one by one. &&Also the Manson family killed 9 people so this title is a double meaning. he should really keep it.&&This is the first thing that I thought too and was hoping that someone would mention! :) &&The Beatles, and John Lennon in particular, had a lot of connections to the number 9. #9 would really work as the movie title. Here's more about it:

&&I remember seeing his interview, he said i'll probably make 10 movies or so... I take it that means he isnt certain&&Kill Bill vol 3? Wasn't that rumored a few years ago?&&He did say that if after making movies he still has stories to tell he could go to HBO or some other cable outlet to make a mini series. I'm almost more hopeful that that happened so that we can get like 8 to 10 hours of a Tarantino story.

They also said the film will take place in both the late 60s and early 70s and is the closest to Pulp Fiction out of previous movies he's made, so that all makes me think this is way more of an intertwined anthology about how the Manson murders changed Los Angeles culture than a straightforward film about the murders themselves.&&He wrote the story for Natural Born Killers.&&I understand the reticence, but I think he could do an excellent job. Reading *Helter Skelter* made it seem pretty perfect for Tarantino, and he's certainly aware how if\* handled badly it could come\* across as insensitive. He's a man of detail, and taps into American culture as a signature, so it seems perfect material for him.

See Manson thought the race war was inevitable remember. The Manson family WANTED to incite that, and so when the Bernard Crowe thing went down, Charlie saw on the news that a black man was shot and killed and became extra paranoid. But the man who was killed wasn't Crowe. It was a random black panther member who happened to be murdered that day. So thinking the black panthers were hot on his tail, he wanted to make the next move look like a retaliation.

The house where Sharon Tate lived was the previous home of a record mogul who owed Charlie money for his recordings and he just wanted revenge for that. It just became a convenient way for him to get his petty revenge.&&It was a drug dealer known as ""Lotsapoppa"" Crowe. Manson shot him in the stomach with a 22 caliber pistol but didn't kill him, though Manson believed he had killed him. &&His name was Bernard Crowe. Pretty sure the bullet is still in him.

In Tarantino's script, the character who ended up being played by Robert Downey Jr is much more of the main character, with a significant portion of screentime going to his news program about Mickey and Mallory, rather than actually following Mickey and Mallory like the final film does.

We exited the ride with everyone confused as to how we all got there, and how something like that would be found at Disney, etc. It was great.

Edit: for those who can't watch the video, the story has a whole setup that you are going to witness the first ever teleportation that obviously goes horribly wrong. Hijacked by an alien, it breaks out of the tube centerpiece in the auditorium, the lights go out and you hear it eat people, squirts warm blood (water) on your neck, and later breathes warm steam and licks your head from behind. Funny the video mentions how people straight up ignored the sign or didn't see it. Yup, that was us.&&When I was 10, I think I went on that ride an it scared the shit out of me. 

I remember that it was sponsored by FedEx and so the gimmick was that you were being shown this brand new teleportation system their using for deep space exploration. So everyone is sitting in there seats, and shoulder restraints come down. The ride doesn't move, this is just to lock you in place so you can't escape.

Terry Crews Files Police Report After Alleging He Was Groped,68888,7bpytv,http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/terry-crews-police-report-sexual-assault-1202610397/,4167,1510189981.0,,"For clarity sake this confirms that it was Adam Venit, a partner WME (major talent agency) who has been suspended following the accusation. &&Good for him.

There needs to a huge sweep of taking out all these predators in the industry.

Maybe more men and women who have been abused will start coming forward and naming names and **filing charges.**&&If the manliest man ever takes a month to admit he got groped, with his own wife as a witness, and with the avalanche of admittance from other Hollywood stars behind him, that should clearly explain why it’s so hard for regular dudes to say that they went through something like this.

Thanks Terry, you’re still the man.&&It takes a certain courage as a guy with a ""manly"" persona to admit that he was sexually abused.

This is an issue that is often overlooked and abuse is a serious issue regardless of status, race or gender.&&This is incredibly valuable for all the men in this country that are assaulted and don't report it out of shame and fear. 

It'll sound weird, but I hope he's not the last to come forward&&Getting groped shouldn't have to do with who you are or how important you are. It just shouldn't happen at all. &&Good for him. Set an example that nobody is too big or too tough or too masculine to take appropriate action against shitheads who think this kind of behavior is acceptable. I hope people of both sexes see this and decide to do the same.&&Filing a ~~charge~~ police report against an exec, a ~~charge~~ police report against Spacey, and [supposedly possible charges against Weinstein.](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-harvey-weinstein-london-20171107-story.html)

More stories with more names coming out in general.

I worry some of my favorite performers may end up monsters in my eyes, but I'm really hoping this is the start of Hollywood actually cleaning house. It's been like this for probably nearly a century and it needs to change.&&Portia De Rossi just came out against Steven Segal https://twitter.com/portiaderossi/status/928393978080358404&&[YOU CAN'T MAKE A PASS, AND PINCH TERRY'S ASS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SQoH24B3C4)

*Yes, I know it isn't the same Terry, or a Terry at all.&&Terry Crews is one of the manliest men alive. He loves his wife, he loves his kids, he’s macho, he’s sensitive, and he’s fucking ripped. I’m a straight guy and I think he’s attractive. He’s a very well-rounded person and has an amazing and extremely likable personality.

Many people look up to Terry for one reason or another. They see him as a role model or as an idol. For him to do this shows these people that it’s okay to seek help with sexual assault and harassment no matter who you are or what you’re situation is. 

I already respected Terry Crews 100%. I now respect him 100% more. 

^^^^^^^DOUBLE ^^^^^^^RESPECT ^^^^^^^POOWWWWEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!&&I hope these detrimental power dynamics in Hollywood are brought down, in every nook and corner, so we can go back to enjoying what we love - talking about movies and not the sleazy underbelly that taints the art. 

But something tells me these stories will keep popping up for some time to come. &&You can't just go around grabbing pussies and dicks. What don't people get about this?&&a lot of people are saying that Terry Crews is brave for doing this, but I support Terry not for his bravery, but for his patience and just response. Being able to not respond in violence is an attribute that is above human nature and deserves every bit of my personal respect&&I know this comment is just a drop of water in the ocean, but I couldn't help myself: I just wanted to say that this cultural shift we're experiencing to people being unashamed to say they were sexually abused is wonderful. I think even five years ago, a big man like that would be laughed off stage and publicly shamed for admitting he felt violated by anyone. No one should have to live with that. Good for you, Terry Crews!!!&&Nine nine! &&I feel like he's done this out of principal and to inspire courage in other men. He's a fucking huge lump of a man, and it's tells the rest of us if it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone. Making it official and reporting it isn't cowardly, Terry fucking crews did it so any of us should do too! 


Good guy Terry. You win the internet today. &&The worst thing about this is people saying stuff like ""you must be brave to grope a person with Terry's physic"". It shows how society is built. Especially when we know how sweet of a person Terry is. He has his roles where he acts hard and stuff, but you see him in his interviews and you see a totally different and genuinely good person. Hope this encourages more people to come out and talk about this.&&I, a male, was groped at Newport Dental in Fullerton, CA. Corporate resolved the issue by telling me if I brought it up again I’d be fired. FUCK YOU NEWPORT DENTAL!!!! &&Terry Crews is the man! So much respect for the guy&&Spoiler alert, dudes don't like getting groped too.&&I was raped in college as a guy by a girl. And everyone has always laughed at me for saying so.

Albeit, the most traumatizing part was having a q-tip shoved up my urethra for the STD panel, it has still affected me. And when I have told people about it, everyone just laughed. Even my own mother.&&Terry Crews is a man all men should look up to, no way this was easy but goddamn what an example. &&I said this before but I think it also applies here so. I think this is a great example of the butterfly effect. That one Hannible Burrus joke, that brought up all of the assualts Bill Cosby committed, seems to have led to a vast increase in the number of women coming forward. Predators who have thrived for decades are being exposed. Its highly likely that some women in the future that would have otherwise been assaulted no longer will be due to more of these predators being caught. Its a revolution for preventing and prosecution of those who commit sexual assault. The world will become a better place, and it all started with a joke. People may study this phenomenon, the rise in statistics it may lead to, and how it all started for years. And we are only at the start. This will probable get buried, but whoever reads this thank you for reading my analysis and have a great day. 
Tldr:A Hannible Burrus Joke, may lead to a potentially historic change in how sexual assault is perceived and prosecuted.

&&The value here is that Crews is a stereotypical alpha male and if he can admit he was assaulted, then it gets much easier for the men in the country who are largely silent. The problem disproportionately affects women, but men need to speak up for ourselves too.&&I'm starting to think I'm the only person who's never been groped.&&[deleted]&&Wasn't this a Brooklyn 99 sketch too?&&Whoever groped Terry Crews is FUCKING BRAVE&&I wish rape got this much attention regardless of who the victim was.&&As someone who's been gropped without approval by female coworkers, I am very thankful for Mister Crews for doing this. (:&&Terry Crews will always be a personal hero of mine and this just further solidifies that&&So in this case and many cases happening - especially to women, what can authorities do? Are there evidences? What if people are making false claims? 

I'm really interested in how these cases are solved. &&So, Terry Crews is a beast. He's a very manly dude. I think he is sending a message that all the other people out there need to start doing the same thing, fight back.&&I think he is highly intelligent. I believe he uses his gift as a way to shed light on this difficult societal prejudice that, for men, sexual harassment isn't a thing. Men should withstand anything. This includes the casual grope. This is the toughest, sweetest celebrity that exists, at least in my opinion, and he came out and admitted he, too, had fallen victim to these vile, abhorrent acts. It shows great courage&&Good for him. I’m glad that we have someone in the public eye who’s willing to fight public stigma despite how difficult I’m sure it must be to share his story and to deal with his pain in the public eye. Sexual assault and rape happen to men, too, and it’s just as disturbing and harmful. &&I've had my ass grabbed three times without wanting it, and my dick grabbed twice without wanting it. By both men and women. Honestly, I don't bring it up not because it's difficult for me to speak about, but because it's not a big deal to me. I certainly didn't like when each of these has happened, but I don't know how much energy I want to exert putting this out to the public, and then having to respond to people's insights. I don't care enough. &&So happy he's coming forward about this! Hope this inspires other men to report sexual assault and not feel embarrassed.&&This is so cool that he did this for several reasons. Mostly because dude could have crushed his skull with one hand and no one would blame him. But he chose to do the right thing. Admirable as fuck. 

I'd love to see him do some good roles besides Brooklyn Nine-Nine where his character is basically a wet noodle. &&EVERYONE. You have this guy all wrong I bet. I think he is pressing charges because THATS WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FUCKING DO.. soooo many victims never press charges he's showing being a bug huge dude that there's no shame with pressing charges. Rape and getting handsy ain't cool. That shit wouldn't get me off and I'm a bonofied fucking freak.&&How much cocaine do you have to be on to have the balls to grope Terry Crews in front of his wife?&&Crews is a straight up awesome guy and role model. I'm happy he is doing this and setting yet another great example. I'm not happy he had to do this though and I feel bad for him.&&As if I couldn't admire him more. You rock Terry!&&I honestly expected a back lash of people saying ""he's a fully grown man - man up"" or ""people have had it worse - groping is nothing"" but I'm pleasantly surprised. 

Stopping serious assaults carried out by a person, possibly on a number of victims, starts by stopping and standing up against the smaller acts of inappropriate behaviour. 

This is particularly inspiring for male victims of abuse to come forward.&&At a young age I was groped by a woman on a busy staircase. It was awful and i felt so much rage I've been very lucky and don't get that often. I never considered groping a woman but that event solidified in my head how awful it must be from that one minor event.&&My husband has been aggressively groped in bars by women on more than one occasion. I was literally standing right next to him one time when a woman came up and grabbed his ass and actually held on while he moved away. If the tables were turned and a man had done that to a woman there would have been a shit storm but instead everyone that saw didn't care. I understand the difference, I understand that  most women don't pose the same physical threat that a man does, but by no means does that make it anywhere near acceptable. If we want to end sexual assault, it needs to end on both sides. Nonconsensual contact is not permissible regardless of gender.&&I was drugged and taken advantage of when I was younger.  Anyone I opened up to told me I was ""lucky I got laid"" or a pussy.  I repressed it for years and to this day I think was the largest contributor to destroying my 20s. 

Now I am happy, successful and healthy and fully over the incident.  Terry teaches a really strong message here.  No matter who you are, you have a voice, do not silence it. I wonder if I would have seen something like this when I was 21 and this happened to me I would have had my voice.  Thank you Terry for helping yourself heal and show others it can be done. &&It really illustrates just how power mad these people are that sexually assault others that someone would feel bold enough to grope someone of the physical stature of Terry Crews. They are absolutely delusional with their sense of importance and domineering power over others.&&I reported what happened to me and it didn’t seem to matter. I know I’m not famous, but the perpetrator is. It makes it harder to be strong when you think you’ve done the right thing, but nothing comes of it. I’m racking my brain trying to think of something else I can do to help stop him and fight against this. &&Oh Jesus, I am literally watching Brooklyn Nine Nine right now, such a great actor, that's really too bad, He is so Manly but has a such a heart of gold, I hope justice gets served here.&&Is it just me or is it strange that the news site didn't mention the specific words ""sexual harassment"" like they would with any woman? Maybe I'm reading too far into things but is there a difference?&&I’m so glad this whole Hollywood Exec Scumbag avalanche is allowing men to come forward too and share their stories!  Fuck those execs, and support to all their victims &&Not only does there need to be a huge sweep of eliminations against these creeps, but there also needs to be a change in the way that society handles men coming out with sexual assault allegations. If a 6-foot-5, 230 pound man can get groped in public (and in front of his wife) and come out and openly say it without getting laughed away, that's definitely a step in the right direction.&&The filing charges is the important part, we don't often hear about charges being laid. All the ones we see in the media do they have associated charges laid?&&He's also had a ton of support from the public. The reddit threads about his story have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive but that's not the case for a lot of victims. Asia Argento has been [run out of Italy for coming forward about Weinstein raping her.](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/asia-argento-harvey-weinstein-italian-backlash) That kind of backlash against her sends a story to victims that it's not always safe to come forward. The public needs to realize that their reactions to these stories also play a major role in whether or not people feel safe enough to speak out.&&I hope more people see this.&&He's even cooler than he was before for reporting it. He's not *still* the man, he's *more* the man. Nothing was lost here, only gained. &&/thread

I don't know how twitter works (or how many people see reddit comments), but I wish you could tweet that message out so a shitload of people could read it. Everyone needs to read what you just wrote. It is so fucking true. It's hard to admit this stuff when you're a guy. It's emasculating, humiliating, all that shit.&&Women's and children's voice. &&This is a valid point. It's so hard for **anyone** to come forward and say they went through something like this. It amazes me how much fear prevents people from speaking up. Fear of being perceived a certain way, of not being believed. Fear of what other people (who likely haven't experienced sexual assault/harassment) think. Shouldn't it be ok to say when someone has harmed you?&&It has nothing to do with being 'manly', it's all about the power these people hold in this industry. Some of the bigger names have come out as being some type of molested or accosted at some point in their career, even after they have been mainstays in the social construct we have come to know. It goes to show the reach and power they once had, and we are witnessing history watching it all unfold. 


This is going to cause major change in their industry whether they know or like it at all. I'm genuinely interested at how everything will turn out and how many people will come forward in the next year's time, but I honestly regret what all of these people have gone through to get where they are. Was it really worth it all?&&I'm certain that that's why he's doing it. He's been one of the more unashamed people in entertainment, and I think he recognises the importance of removing the stigma here. &&Honestly Terry is the perfect person to admit this. I don’t think people will question his manliness because of who he is. Plus he’s just an all around awesome dude and can be a strong advocate/example in this situation.&&I see Terry as one of the extremely few celebrities to be able to pull this out, his incredible charm and genuine popularity is a bit hard to put down, only other guy I see capable of this is Leonardo Di Caprio or maybe Brad Pitt, very stupid move on Venit behalf.&&It may be a matter of semantics, but being grabbed/groped once is not sexual abuse.  It is sexual assault.&&It takes a certain courage to grope a guy whose biceps are larger than your face.&&>It takes a certain courage as a guy with a ""manly"" persona to admit that he was sexually abused.
>
>This is an issue that is often overlooked and abuse is a serious issue regardless of status, race or gender.

Yeah, but the true test is going to be when a man like him comes forth with accusations against a woman. You'll see a lot of people picking sides, when it should be as cut-and-dried an issue as any other.&&Absolutely. These predators need to be reported on regardless of the sex of the victims.

Also, as /u/mi-16evil pointed out in the stickied comment, the subject in question is Adam Venit of WME.

In case you're wondering who he represents, here is a list of clients who will undoubtedly drop him and move to another agent under WME:

-Adam Sandler, Emma Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Dustin Hoffman, Liam Hemsworth, Michael B. Jordan, Vince Vaughn, Eddie Murphy, William H. Macy, Steve Martin, Kevin James, Hank Azaria, Marc Forster, Shawn Levy.

*list courtesy of WME's imdbpro page.*&&Man, Terry crews is a stand-up guy&&I‘m also glad that he didn‘t wait until the statute of limitations had expired. Now there can actual be a trial and justice. &&Hey bro. Just gonna come out and say it. I work in the industry and it's definitely happened to me on more than one occasion from both men and women.  

A slap on the ass, backing up into my junk, asking me about my sexual fetishes, people saying that they're a ""full service"" industry professional.

No joke, it's hard enough out there and my paycheck was more important to me at the time, but damn.  I seriously don't know what I would do if that happened again

Edit: my old boss admitted that she only hired me so that she could work on sleeping with me. Yes this was a woman. Yes this was Hollywood.  We were friends for a few years after I stopped working for her and we ran into each other and she admitted that shit. How the fuck are you supposed to laugh something like that off? 

EDIT2: now that this is off the front page in the hype will inevitably die down, it is really upsetting to see how many other people go through this, and it's equally upsetting to see how many people think that it shouldn't matter. Of course there are going to be people that get touched or harassed and are okay with it. But there are other people out there who are not okay with it, and who want to have their vision of a normal life which doesn't include all of that.&&I thought the other day that I now knew something about how women must feel with aggressive men. I was at a party, and a guy there started getting pretty close, and eventually dropped a hand on my knee, with a squeeze. I gave the very good natured, super polite tone ""Sorry bud, you ain't gettin anywhere. I am completely straight, no wiggle room."" He seemed to take it fine, BUT... He followed me around the rest of the evening, plopping down next to me wherever i was sitting, and would start getting handsy and shit. I'd make my excuses, and go to a different room, etc.

I thought, haha! this is how a girl feels at a party with a douchey guy. Then I realized a couple days later, no... that isn't how they feel. At no point during my evening did the thought that he might overpower me and get physical cross my mind. Despite him having some serious weight, I'm pretty sure I could have shut him down with no problems, therefore I never even thought about it.

What if the guy had been like Terry Crews size and fit (shut my blasphemous mouth)? Would I still have thought it was just mildly annoying, and something to laugh about?

No, I **DONT** fucking know what it feels like to be sexually assaulted. I have never been in a situation where I didn't feel like I was in control of the circumstances. 

So, within the past 48hrs i've kinda changed my view about casual, unwanted sexual contact. Depending on the situation, an ass smack, a grope, persistent contact, etc is no longer just ""eh, an asshole being obnoxious"" That is now the bare minimum, ranging up to what I used to roll my eyes about: calling it sexual assault.

Pertinent to this situation, it definitely doesn't have to be just a physical size disparity. Power applies as well.&&As a guy that was groped by a coworker, I am glad too. I always felt like a coward for not reporting my coworker for what he did to me so  it is amazing to see that it can happen to anybody... even a guy like Crews. I hope it never happens to me again, but if it does I hope that I'll be able to stand up for myself like Crews is now doing.&&‘If Terry Crews can do it.’ 

This is good, I know what you mean. Ultra masculine looking fellow going through the proper legal channels for this.&&Women don’t report for many of the same reasons. They get labeled a slut and judged. It’s very brave for anyone to come forward. I wish i was brave &&Hopefully this stops the sexual assault before decades of abuse. &&I agree 100%. But having Crews help clear away the stigma preventing other men from coming forward is laudable. &&I was groped by a girl I worked with. I had started the job shortly before this happened so I still wasn’t comfortable with everyone.

She gripped my inner ass cheek so hard that I felt her fingers on my asshole through my pants, then she offered me a blowjob. I was so confused and upset about it that I just froze. Ultimately I was afraid of being labeled or emasculated by the other men I worked with who knew her a lot longer. I’ve never told anyone about it, even my wife.

None of us involved are important or famous or wealthy but this whole thing keeps leveling it for me. It can happen to anyone. I don’t think that girl wanted to suck my dick she wanted to put me in my place. 

People can be fucking awful sometimes.

 I’m glad Terry Crews is doing this. Fuck anyone who thinks they can just do what ever the fuck they want.&&What’s really depressing is seeing these stories on Facebook. It’s clear a huge amount of people don’t even consider groping people harassment. They think that’s how you flirt and show interest. They say shit like “next up: do not look at women for more than 3 seconds”. &&The thing with our favorite performers is that they're just people, and people are monsters.&&Portia de Rossi just said Steven Segal unzipped his pants in front of her: https://twitter.com/portiaderossi/status/928393978080358404&&Yeah, as a movie fan its a stressful time. My favorite actors haven't been implicated in anything so far, but I hope that heroes like Russell Crowe, De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Anthony Hopkins don't show up in any news. Ben Affleck was in the news for a bit, but it didn't seem to have been much of a story.&&For me, it doesn't take away from their performances.

Showing your son that it's okay to speak up when someone has sexually harassed you even if you're a man is important. That kids lucky to have a dad like Terry. &&> I’m a straight guy and I think he’s attractive

I just wanted to shitpost and say how funny it is to always see this whenever a guy compliments another guys appearance. Girls hardly ever have to defend themselves by saying ""I'm straight but she's beautiful,"" so why do you?

you don't need to be gay or clarify that you aren't to recognize good looks of the same sex my dude&&Pcmasterrace too&&It's not like they'll stop making movies in the meantime. I hope this never stops. Not because I want people to get taken advantage of, but because I know people always will be and we need to enable the victims to speak out instead of trying to convince ourselves it's all blown over.&&Anywhere there's someone who's the boss and someone who's the subordinate, this stuff is bound to happen. 

HOWEVER, what's important is that there's both a system in place to deal with this shit and most importantly a CULTURE in place that will accept people coming forward with accusations without immediately blacklisting victims/accusers. And, if successful, without immediately blacklisting the accused, not until proven guilty of wrongdoing. &&The can't part. &&Noine Noine!!!!&&It goes to show that the control people have over others can me a more fearsome form of power than the size of the pecs on your chest. This gives me even more respect for Terry Crews for overcoming this.&&Yeah the implication is that just because a man is big, he will respond with physical violence.  Gee, it turns out that Crews is a bigger person that his assaulter, and decided not to get physically violent.  

This is why there are so many myths out there about sexual abuse and sexual assault!  &&As a taller bigger guy, this is why I don't go out to clubs or pubs very often. There's ALWAYS some dude that wants to show off to someone how tough he is.&&You know you can sue for that, right?&&Thank you for speaking up. 

Can you go to the Police about it? Also perhaps take it further with worker compensation/bullying legislation? &&Bruh you could sue the shit outta them for that&&Wow that is sad.  As a parent of 3 kids When children rough house and are tickling or forcing hugs, even at the young age of 3 boy and sister 7 1/2 I tell them when someone says stop you stop.  Don't hug your brother if he says no, don't tickle your sister if she says no.  Unwanted contact goes both ways.  Maybe it is because I was diagnosed with autism and have a touching thing and people in the 80s because I was hyper and not in the ""rainman"" type bubble people would either think I was just ADHD and would expect hugs, and tickling and it really was a stressful thing.  I think it is important that both men and women grow with healthy boundaries.  My wife can embrace me, unless I'm not okay with it.  My kids don't always get to hang in me if it starts to be a stressor.  And I think those boundaries are most important in a sexual manner.  And having a penis doesn't exempt you from feeling violated.  I wish your mother had better empathy on the matter and saw it from your view point &&As a mom, I warn my teenage sons about this all the time because it happened to a guy I knew in college. Messed him up.  They laugh at me. &&Me too bro, so drunk I couldn't fight off this big girl who constantly harassed me and she got me hard and sat on my dick until finally I wrestled her off. She called me a faggot and I left then later she told our friends and everyone laughed.

It hasn't scarred me or anything, this happened over 10 years ago and I see her from time to time when I go back home and I don't hate her but it's pervasive in our culture that her kind of behaviour is only slightly unacceptable.&&You're not alone. My mom's reaction was, ""Well, what do you want me to do about it?"" IDK, could start by giving a shit.

Anyway, it's not funny, and I'm sorry you went through that.&&Hannibal Buress&&Hannibal Buress saves Hollywood from itself. 

I don't get why people keep attributing this snowball effect to Buress. He haphazardly made a rape joke involving Cosby and he just keeps coming up as being responsible for all this dirty laundry being aired out. I personally don't see it. 

On a sidenote: I fucking love Hannibal. He's hilarious. I love his pickle juice joke. I saw him live and cried the entire show from how funny he was. &&Don't get ahead of yourself. Netflix went ahead and publicly stated they're going to keep working with Danny Masterson.

Scientology's lawyers may be able to keep him free anyway but Netflix didn't even wait for cops to get involved before cutting ties with Kevin Spacey.&&I'll grope you if you want, if  you're feeling left out&&Not to be pedantic, but it wasn't a sketch, it was an episode, and the episode I believe you're referring to involved Terry being mistreated by another cop because he was walking around the neighborhood and being a  black man.&&Some dude grabbed his junk at a party while his wife was there. 

Someone had to have so much experience getting away with this shit, they were able to look past the epic asswhooping a normal person receive from someone the size of Terry Crews and grab his junk anyway. 

And he was right. 

Terry crews tamped down the urge to do something about it because he knew this might hurt his career. &&Not brave, more like having enough confidence that he will get away with it. Hollywood is truly disgusting.

I hope Bryan Singer is next. Another ""open secret"". &&When he spoke about it a few weeks ago it basically boiled down to him being a position of not being able to do anything. Everyone there would have just brushed it off as the giant black man is starting shit&&you mispelled ""piece of shit""&&Under what circumstances did this happen if you don’t mind me asking? &&Same here. It is ridiculous people think they can touch others like that.&&You're entitled to your feelings (or lack thereof) about it. Just as other people are entitled to feel like they've have a crime committed against them, because they have.&&I am so thrilled at this moment that no one is laughing at him.  I have not seen a single comment like that, and I am really happy that our culture is clearly in the middle of a massive shift.  If this would have been reported 5 years ago even, it would have been a joke.  Now all I see are people taking Crews' claims seriously, and genuinely supporting him.  Thank God.  I hope we can continue down this path.  I am hopeful that we are witnessing a real change in all this unfold before our eyes.  Victims of sexual assault deserve justice and they deserve our support, it does not matter how big and manly they are.  &&I think the response would be very different if it had been a woman that groped him. But as you said, a step in the right direction nonetheless. &&There needs to be a change in the way society handles women coming out with sexual assault allegations too. On the whole it's any combination of ""stop whining"" ""it was your own fault"" and ""you're just after something"" for both men and women.&&Absolutely. Sexual assault of men  (by men and women) needs to stop being treated as a joke. &&Terry Crews is a (inter)national treasure.

A while ago on r-AskMen there was a thread on who is the quintessential modern role model for men. He scored high.&&Damn thats pretty terrible that you find the courage to come forward only to be called a whore and told to be thankful that someone did those things to you. Least of all these accusations coming from your own people. Is the view on woman this bad in italy? &&Yup it's why I feel it's weird when I see some people claiming that Rapp had ulterior motives for making his accusation when he did.

He made it against a person without any current accusations against him, and had no guarantee that we would be willing to crucify spacey in the same way we would a random money man.&&>described the encounter as “consensual” and not “‘abuse.‘” 

This annoys me so much. If consent was given under duress, it's still abuse in my eyes. He had a position of authority over these women and he abused that position and therefore abused those women. It doesn't matter, to me, if they ""consented"" and didn't kick him in the balls or fight tooth and nail, it doesn't sound like it was really true ""consent"" but more ""I don't really have a choice unless I want to give up on the career I've worked so hard for."" &&Frankly, citing *Libero* as the voice of Italy is like using *The Sun* or *The Daily Mail* to explain the opinion of the entire UK.

(I don't know enough about the American tabloid counterparts to explain this)&&And then in the other thread about Mariah being an opportunistic creep people are arguing about which era Mariah it is because she used to be hotter. And whether they would “let” her harass them in her current state.&&I love Italy, but man can they be socially regressive in some ways. &&Weinstein hired old Mossad agents to bully the victims who came forth. He should be behind bars already.&&I find it really crazy that every time a man comes out with this, we believe them. It's all ""how brave"" and ""good for him"". But when women do it we still act like assholes about it.

It takes decades and dozens of accusations to take down people like Weinstein or Cosby. But one dude says something publicly about Spacy and we go right for the throat. Crews says something and everyone is all supportive. But Argento is run out of town. McGowan gets accused of fuckery.

How do we not give women the same support, or at least benefit of the doubt?&&That's sad. I love Asia and her father is an absolute legend (Dario Argento if any are unaware). I've had a crush on her since I was in middle school. It's a damn shame she's getting so much crap.&&I've also noticed an interesting difference in the way the accused are treated as well. Weinstein had sympathizers and his accusations caused a lot of hubub. Then Spacey gets accused of sexually harassing and assaulting men and not even 4chan seems to run to his aid. The difference is interesting and I think it says a lot about societies attitude to ""straight dude harasses/assaults women"" VS ""gay man harasses other gay men""&&>The paper’s editor, Vittorio Feltri, said in a radio interview that the encounter must have been consensual because he didn’t physical assault her, **and that she should be thankful that he *forcibly* performed oral sex on her.**

>thankful ... forcibly performed&&This thread should be taken as an example of how all victims should be treated when they come out with allegations. I've noticed there are no ""Well, lets wait and see until we have all the facts"" or ""Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?"" around here. It's crazy how some victims are treated like liars by default.&&Less than human, that's the only way I can express my rage and disgust at such treatment. &&Twitter however was pretty harsh and claimed he was casting a shadow over female victims by talking about his harassment.&&IIRC someone else said the same thing on twitter and it got a ton of likes/retweets&&EXACTLY!!! You hit the nail on the head. I still struggle with the after-effects of my experiences, especially due to the emasculation it brings. It feels doubled when you're not ""the manliest man""-type.&&I think it's hard to admit something like this no matter your gender. The vast majority of sexual assaults go unreported regardless of who was assaulted (race, gender, sexual orientation...). &&Terry is dead set a legend.

He is fully open about things that are stupidly hard to talk about, let alone come to terms with.

His openness and strength in response to the way his father was is beyond admirable.

The way he was treated in the NFL was also bullshit, yet he had the strength to pack it in cos no career is worth that, no matter how potentially profitable, is inspiring.

Then this.

This bloke ticks so many ""role model"" boxes, it's insane.

The story of him building a computer for and with his son gets me teary everytime too.&&If you read this, we love ya Terry!&&He spoke out about it when he did to show support for the women that Weinstein assaulted because many of them were not believed by the general public. &&I can see Dwayne Johnson coming forward about something like that. Though by ""coming forward"", that might mean his fist comes forward.. through the guy's skull.&&I'd agree that ""harassment"" is a pattern of behavior and not a one time incident; I'm not sure I'd agree that ""abuse"" can't be a single incident.&&Terry Crews even pointed out that he couldn't physically do anything to the guy, because he knew the headline would be ""240 pound black man assaults Hollywood producer"". These people have power and protection that makes them untouchable. It's not courage if you're certain your victim can't fight back.&&Not if you have money and power&&> It takes a certain courage to grope a guy whose biceps are larger than your face.

That's probably the exact reason why this scumbag targeted Crews. To take such a strong guy and put him in a position where he can't/won't use his strength. To make him feel small while the abuser gets to feel powerful.&&I'm sorry for calling you out because it's a societal thing, but this is a bullshit sentiment and it's a huge problem for everyone. It leads to

""Maybe if I was bigger/stronger/faster/smarter I wouldn't have been abused""

And 

""If I tell people I was abused they will think I'm small/weak/slow/dumb""

Especially if they didn't actively fight them off (which is a typical, normal response).&&This is what's fascinating to me. How in the actual fuck did he not think he was going to get sent through a wall for It?

This goes to show there's an entire world I don't understand of these mega rich elite fucks who simply live in a world of apathy and power abuse.

I'm not being ballsy here but I don't care how much money or power you have, you touch me inappropriately and I'll break your god damn hand.&&> Absolutely. These predators need to be reported on regardless of the sex of the victims

Or regardless of position. I was in the marines and we all had to watch a sexual harrassment training video to satisfy some roster (they happen all the time and are soul-crushingly boring). Normally we blow it off and shoot the shit or something during these administrative training vids. This one especially since we were infantry and thus no women around (at the time). 


Then, all of a sudden we see one of our fucking former battalion snipers appear on the video telling us how he got wasted at a party and woke up to find his pants down and discovered that he had been ass-raped by a Navy doc. 


If a marine sniper can get sexually assaulted, so can you!&&Holy fucking balls&&Dustin Hoffman might have a credibility problem when feigning indignation.&&>Absolutely. These predators need to be reported on regardless of the sex of the victims.


OR the sex of the perpetrators...
&&Those people represent so much fucking money. Jesus.&&He is an amazing guy.  Kind, funny, and a genuinely nice person.  

It really helps that he is being so straight forward about this and being so honest about the whole situation.  Remember this is a former NFL player, what many people see as the epitome of manliness. 

Him admitting the shame and embarrassment he felt and how it stopped him from coming forward is really important.  Specially how he says he was inspired by all the women who decided to be brave and finally go public about their own ordeals.  &&No, he's an actor.&&Hopefully this will encourage that lady who's not out of the statue of limitations to press charges against Weinstein.&&Lupita Nyongo's article about her creepy encounters with Weinstein does an excellent job of explaining that in a profession where your body is literally your work instrument and primary asset, it is widely understood that physical boundaries are more porous than elsewhere. 

Acting requires publicly doing with coworkers and semi-strangers things that most of us will ever only do with partners and loved ones. &&[deleted]&&Why the fuck is this getting downvoted???  I'm so sorry you had to go through that &&I can understand the ass slapping between male friends (did this in highschool no one thought it was weird due to camaraderie), but backing up in the junk is just wrong. &&I’ve had similar experience, I was even stalked by a man. I also thought “oh shit this is how girls feel.” Then I told my sister about it then I realized and also told her “if I was a girl I’d be scared as hell.” Because the man didn’t scare me, I knew if anything happened I could beat his ass pretty easily. That also sort of changed my mind about being sexually harassed. Like... this situation would be terrifying if I was a small girl my sister’s size. Especially when he’d “run into me” at night. 

I feel for girls in these situations so much more now. &&This is exactly it. 

I'm 6'2 and 250lb, so I haven't had first hand experience, but I think a lot of guys brush it off being like 'I'd be super happy if I got that much attention from the ladies' however, imagine pretty much every one of them is bigger and stronger than you and could force themselves on you and there's nothing you could do about it. I think they'd change their minds about it pretty fast. That would be terrifying.&&It's a shame it takes power being taken to realize how fragile and relative a concept power even is. Thank you for sharing.&&I think your comment highlights an important problem that leads to men saying things like ""just suck it up"" when women report sexual harassment or assault: as a woman, getting groped by a man isn't just uncomfortable, it's fucking traumatic because it is so physically overbearing and there is no chance at a successful resistance if it were to turn into rape (assuming the woman is smaller than the man which is true in the majority of cases). Whereas if a guy grabbed my thigh or something, as a dude, I would be irritated but not scarred because I wouldn't even think of it turning into rape. What one might consider traumatic isn't necessarily what everyone would. &&It's encouraging to see so many people thinking deeply about what these cases mean and how we could treat each other better. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.&&A small man assaulted me while I was falling asleep. While emerging from the dream, I realized that he was strong for his size and that he was not, in fact, my friend. 

Before that, a man bigger and stronger than me assaulted me using his weight and also by stunning me by yelling at me close to my face repeatedly.

Both times it was simple, unwanted, seemingly harmless flirtation on their part followed by very sudden assault.

I guess my point is that it can happen in many different ways.&&I think your perspective further stigmatizes men.

The idea that men don't get scared, men can't be hurt because they are strong, men can't be traumatized etc only leads to a man who is sexually assaulted feeling like he can't come forward. Men and women can both get scared by unwanted contact, they can both be traumatized by unwanted experiences and physical size and strength is not the key determinant of how one will experience something. Men and women come in many sizes, either can be big or small, strong or weak. Men are overpowered all the time...the majority of physical assaults and murders are of men. They are not invincible and there is nothing wrong with a man feeling scared by the experience you describe above.
People's past experiences shape how they will experience newer situations.

All women (and all men) are not the same. I am a woman and I can also at times just be uncomfortable...not scared or traumatized. The idea that men can never know what women experience and that men never have to experience that really just invalidates everyone's experience. Rather than saying...this is the male experience and this is the female experience we need to instead focus on how the individual was impacted and accept that. It is okay for a man to be scared or traumatized by unwanted sexual contact, it doesn't mean they are weak, or not a man, or acting like a woman. 

I am posting this to your comment because I see a number of responses affirming your perspective that men would only experience unwanted sexual contact as discomfort but nothing more and that women would be scared and traumatized.&&That is partly why I feel I can't stick up for myself. I want to say ""oi stop being a knob. I don't like you in that way."" but saying that to a guy who's taller and bigger than you, you don't know anything about, who could very well be violent and aggressive is a real risk. Some guys really dislike rejection, even if you're simply rejecting poor behaviour. However, we can go to a guy friend and tell them what is happening and they can take us under their wing and keep an eye on the guy in question for us, which is always comforting. 

So any guys reading this, if a girl ever comes up to you at a party saying a guy is making her uncomfortable, it really helps if you offer to look out for her, keep her with your group of friends and *actually do so*. You may not see what the guy is doing specifically as it's often covert, but believe what the girl says. It makes a big difference and can turn a negative experience into a more positive one.  &&What an excellent insight you've had. Well done. &&I think you're totally right. I've been thinking lately about the effects of privilege and trying to be aware of it. Most people think of white males, but yet another thing is being physically big. I think I take for granted how safe I feel because of my stature and that most people wouldn't mess with me. I'm never really scared about such things. But it is helpful to reflect on how I'd feel in certain situations if other people could easily overpower me.&&I definitely agree with you. Specially him for how big he is. &&A girl did this to me (i'm a big guys). I turned around and pushed her and told her to touch me again. No one bothered me for it.  For context, this was high school, I was known as the quiet guy, and she was being an asshole bothering me just to see how I'd respond and she saw it.

In hindsight, she never interacted with me after that at all. I never noticed until thinking about it.

people don't understand that sexual harassment has an added layer for men. It's super horrible for everyone, but for women, no one is going to question their femininity. For men, masculinity will be questioned. It shouldn't be, but it will be. And what's worse is if you do something about it you're a ""punk"" and if you do nothing, you're a ""punk"". Especially when it's a woman doing the assaulting. I hate when people have the mindset ""you should like it because you're a guy"". People in general have no sympathy for little boys who are raped by women and sometimes by men/other boys. So I know even fewer have sympathy for men assaulted by women their own age or younger.

Either way, I'm sure within 100 or so years, we'll be pass this and have an actual equal view of men and women, assuming it's possible. I'm not convinced it's what most people actually want. &&It's still such a bizarre topic to even talk about. But nevertheless, I'm sorry this happened to you. Especially in a work-place environment. Imagine if the tables had been turned, and you were the one grasping her ass like that. You'd be labelled a sex offender so quick you wouldn't know what hit you. Hopefully things change for the better moving forward. &&Thank you for telling your story. Freezing up is a natural reaction to something so voilatingly unexpected. Often when women are asked why they didn't fight back, the answer is they just froze. It's hard to explain unless you've been in that situation. I'm so encouraged by the floodgates of people of both sexes speaking out on their experiences because maybe we're finally at a point that this behavior will not be tolerated towards anyone. &&>...people are monsters.

Pretty sure that's George RR's entire premise on the Game of Thrones series...&&You just need to make peace with the fact that people make the art you like, and people are multidimensional beings rather than just one thing; the art they make is a reflection of one part of them, their personalities and aspirations, but it's far from the full picture.  

It's natural to want to like the people who make art that matters to you or moves you, but it's also probably a mistake.  &&If Mr. Rogers got busted I would legit be depressed for at least a week.&&Uh oh you didnt know about russel crowe?&&De Niro is an antivaxxer and supports ""Dr."" Wakefield, Crowe was arrested and plead guilty to assault, Hopkins is a recovering alcoholic, and Eastwood's has a combination of political views where anyone will be offended by at least one of them.

None of them are at the same level as Weinstein or Spacey, but if you dig deep enough on anyone, you'll find something.&&Are we seriously not doing phrasing anymore?&&Seriously. I've said something along these lines multiple times in my life ""The only entertainer I can really think of that's a true family man who hasn't done anything questionable is Bill Cosby.""

So it was a bit hard for me to hear all that. Even harder to see him take the accusations so lightheartedly and make jokes and look like he didn't care. &&My friend has some creepy stories about Jason Segal. &&Haha, fucking hell! Next we'll hear Hiro humped Baymax on set.&&Can we treat all these sexual assault claims for what they are, *allegations*, at least until the defendants are proven guilty? Once a claim is made (which is easy to do), the public always automatically take the accusers' side and form a lynch mob without making sure of the truth. Allegations can ruin a person's life, even if the person is innocent. If there were multiple claims from different people and hard evidence of non-consent, like in the Harvey Weinstein case, then I'd fully support the victims. If not, I think we should just read and listen without passing judgment just yet.&&I thought he moved to Russia because people there love him and nobody here gives a shit about his tubby washed-up C-list ass.

I didn't know he was also running from justice.&&""Ya kill the joe, ya make some mo'!

Not sure if tru tho.&&We're all lucky to have a role model like Terry!&&I'm a straight guy and I'd suck Terry's dick, but I'm straight tho.

But I'd still have intercourse with him and love him as my partner and hopefully grow old with him, even buy a house somewhere and adopt a few kids and raise them to become functioning members of society with loving parents, and then help them with their career and hopefully see them get married and share my happiness with Terry till the day we die.

But I'm straight tho.
Just sayin.&&^this. Actors/actresses are human which means the potential to be monsters is always there, so sexual harassment is unlikely to be ""eliminated"" forever from this. Instead, as you mentioned, hopefully this continued pattern of ""whistle blowing"" in Hollywood will make some people think twice about harassing someone, and give others confidence to speak out when it does happen. &&He probably still can, this is one of those times where lawyering up is a real advice.&&Based on what evidence though? &&The Sarge also mentions having body image issues a fair amount.

There's a kinship, almost.&&> If consent was given under duress, it's ~~still abuse~~ not consent 

all you need to say &&I would note; I tended to be cautious in believing accusations of one person against another person. Whether that be male or female accusations.

When the Spacey allegations first came out it was only one person's claims, so I wasn't sure what to believe; so I presume innocence. But now those claims have not only been corroborated by others, but many others have come forward with similar accusations. So I'm siding towards guilty.

Terry had his wife and others at the event who corroborated those events.

Cosby has a legion of women who accuse him of the same if not similar crimes. Weinstein is the same.

So to me it's all about multiple people corroborating each other when I'm willing to (mentally) find him (which in all these cases it's been males) guilty. If I don't have that then I feel like I must at least not make a judgement as to who is telling the truth, but err on the side of presuming innocence.

I've said something similar in the past and been called a victim blamer for it (albeit by people I find unreasonable at the best of times), but still.&&Can you describe the NFL and father stuff more?  I've always looked up to Terry but didn't know about those chapters in detail.

Something people like to look over, but is a really huge win for Feminism in men in general.&&""the truly strong are always kind"" Terry Crews is truly strong in every way possible &&Terry would’ve flexed so hard they would’ve teleported to a jail. His muscles can do it all!&&He is also trying to draw attention to why women go so long without accusing the perpetrators.

Terry is awesome and he is trying to help all victims of sexual assault feel more comfortable coming forward.&&Exactly, which plays into my certainty that that's part of his reasoning for making it a legal issue.&&Terry mentioned that he specifically did not go the violent route in part because he *knew* that if he did, it would become a huge racial thing where a large black man beat a small white man, and it would change the entire narrative against him (and he'd be in jail).&&>""240 pound black man assaults Hollywood producer"". 

""240 pound black man assaults homosexual producer"" is more like it.  It would be a hate crime. People would think Terry was just being homophobic, a gay man smiled at him and he went crazy and got violent.&&He has B O BLOCKING POOOWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!

He has nothing to fear&&Holy shit, what happened to the guy that did it?&&Was he in 1/4? I was a HM and might know the doc in question. He was a chief or senior chief at the time and got court martialed, busted down to E-1 and thrown in the brig. Wonder if this is the same case.&&Jesus that has to be terrifying. &&You know to me it’s more the fact that man was brave enough to put that on a video and tell others what happened to him.  I think sexual assault as a whole happens to more people than we know simply because it’s hard to share.  Victim blaming happens for when you get hit by a car “should you have been walking during that OK to walk sign or should you have anticipated that car was going to hit you?”.  No matter what? The more we talk openly about this shit the harder it is for people to get away with it.&&I keep forgetting he's involved.

The seemingly most boring fuddy duddy people are being caught up in this thing.

&&Yeah, he’s willing to put his own reputation on the line (which is fucking ridiculous that your reputation can be tarnished from being sexually assaulted) so that he can hopefully empower others to come forward. Many men don’t come forward out of fear that it will make them feel weak, or less of a man, so having the “epitome of manliness” come forward and say “me too” hopefully will start a chain reaction among men who previously thought they wouldn’t be taken seriously, or that it would somehow tarnish their reputation.

Thank you Terry Crews, for being a genuine, inspiring person, when many people have lost hope.&&He's one of the few celebrities I'd actually like to hang out with.  Seems like a pretty stand up guy from all angles that I've seen (don't kill me if he did something wrong).&&I honestly forgot he played in the NFL. I just assumed that he was so genuine and charismatic that the second anyone meets him they just offer him a job and that's how he landed in Hollywood&&In this day and age it's awesome to hear that Terry Crews is saying he got strength from other women admitting their abuse, coming from somebody that is the epitome of strength as an image

Edit: bad proofreading,  and voice typing&&He's a great father too! Got into pc gaming so he'd have something he could do with his son. Even built their computer together to play games on.&&Also part of PC MASTER RACE :)&&Also, the man is a muscle mountain, doing what he did makes the road for the rest a lot easier.&&He's also spoken up about porn addiction which is something I think has a really weird stigma so props to him for being a respectable voice to a pretty undiscussed issue&&I look through every Terry Crews to see if there is a dissenting opinion that he is anything other than a top-notch human being. Still haven't heard anything negative mentioned about the guy. &&No... he’s a future President. &&So, he can’t stand up?&&No, he's a retired football player&&He had a seizure from withdrawal that resulted in permanent brain damage&&Because some men see this as a fantasy or “the good life” as opposed to it being sexual assault. Unwanted sexual touching isn’t more comfortable because the person may or may not be attractive. Some people can’t wrap their mind around that fact. &&I straight-up had someone try to take my shirt off at a bar because they thought it would be funny. I honestly felt like I was a kid again being tormented by my older cousins.

People are fucking retarded&&I remember reading somewhere here on Reddit where a guy was asking in a comment what the big deal was about rape.  He said if he woke up and found a woman riding on top of him without his consent, then he'd be like, ""LOL, stop.""  But claimed he wouldn't be traumatized by it.  I don't think it ever crossed his mind to think what it would be like to wake up to a powerful guy pinning him down and plowing his ass into oblivion.&&I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no fairy-tale world. He never said who did it, but we all knew. Things went on like that for awhile - prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. The Sisters kept at him - sometimes he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not. And that's how it went for Andy - that was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him, and I also believe that if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him.&&It doesn't even have to escalate to rape, what if my rejection of that contact ends with me being punched in the face by someone with twice my strength? It's fucking scary and you can't trust bystanders to help you 90% of the time. &&which makes it difficult for a guy to wrap his head around the flexibility of the act.

 ""What do you mean the severity has nothing to do with the aggressor's intent, and everything to do with the victim's perception???"" 

It sounds irrational compared to every other situation without wrapping your head around the victim's frame of reference. Normally, people tend to put themselves in the shoes of the accused when making judgment. They use that exercise to decide if something is a big deal or not. Sexual assault causes controversy because you can have the exact same physical action, with the exact same ""playful, not serious"" intent, but yet wildly different severities depending on how the victim felt. If the victim had zero concern about being able to shut it down, it is hard to call it a ""crime"". If the victim was scared that the action was a preview of what was to come later, and felt that they had no control over the situation, it turns into one of the most horrific types of assault short of rape.&&> Imagine if the tables had been turned, and you were the one grasping her ass like that. You'd be labelled a sex offender so quick you wouldn't know what hit you

Which is how it should be. It should just work the same for both men and women.&&And, as said in the Witcher series :

""I've heard witchers carry 2 blades. One for monsters and one for humans.""

""Both are for monsters.""&&Pretty sure that's the premise of everything. Or at least, it's displayed in some way, shape, or form. Scooby Doo comes to mind.&&Only a week? Cosby was ""depressed for a week"" tier. Mr. Rogers would be ""give up on humanity entirely"" tier.&&Literally impossible&&""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood... and it's gonna fucking stay that way."" &&more like “the rest of my life.”&&Elaborate?&&Wtf?

That's a weirdly specific example!&&I'm not sure you understand how Reddit works... /s&&He also got a deal from uncle Putin to advertise some Russian made rifles.&&Terry Crews is a great example of what masculinity should look like&&Walk into the gym, find the biggest person there, and chances are they're likely insecure about their body and image. Heck, I know I am and others would consider me a muscular bear.


""The day you started lifting is the day you became forever small because you will never be as big as you want to be."" -Brofessor&&It shares some similarities. I just didn't want to ruin the whole episode by writing what happens.&&But it does mean the option is available to him.&&he specifically said he didn't solve it with violence because of how it would appear. Big giant black man pounding a presumably older white executive.&&He's not speaking to how Crews solves all grievances, just how he could react to being groped. &&Wasn't there a big thing a few years ago in the U.K. regarding this sort of thing, except with politicians and various types of millionaires from TV, radio, etc?&&Which means this happens in workplaces all across America. And someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to lose their job is more likely to stay silent-- they have more on the line. &&As far as I know he just uses his status on set to hire young guys to try and hook up with. Freaky as he may be, I don't think he does any illegal groping or rapey shit.&&Um, you can sexually harass/assault people who are of age too. That said I have no idea who that person is or what they’re into if they’re of age and consent, not just agree because they’re in a powerless position, then ok I guess. &&Any source on that? Literally the first time I’ve ever heard anything like this compared to the years I’ve been hearing about him abusing young boys. &&It can still mean you're a sexual deviant, just not a criminal one. &&Lizzie McGuire is tight,

*BUT I BET ZOEY'S TIGHTERRR.*&&A jury of your peers doesn't mean they fucking know you. &&I wouldn't say mostly. I see a good amount of differing opinions on Reddit.  Though I still have to admit I see people downvoted to Oblivion too frequently for having a valid differing opinions.

Now Facebook.... I've never seen a more horrible place.&&No, it's because he was groped by a man. If it were a woman you'd be more likely to see dismissive comments like that.&&He's black, has establisher himself as a character who is pro women, pro treating people nicely in general, and likes to play roles that are goofy and that are open about their insecurities. And he seems to be able to fully do so himself, not just preach the right words others.

Everyone who likes him already likes him because they see him as someone who would come out so directly, openly and down to earth about something like this. Of course they'll support it.

And everyone who might dislikes him already dislikes him for the same reasons. They already laugh at him for not acting like a tough guy, for not using his size to beat up everyone who looks at him wrong(or gropes them), or using his celebrity status to cheat around or have a 'player' lifestyle. Cause thats what everyone who cant face their insecurities think is the solution, thats what they would do if they were him. And they'll be calling him a cuckold nomather what he does.
&&I lived in Italy for a while, and found the attitude of some of most of the guys I dated shocking to say the least. I'm sure I was just incredibly unlucky.. but sheesh&&can you post the thread please?
&&Is true.
Racist and sexism in Italy is reallly high, of course everyone in Italy believes to be non racist and not homophobic, but in reality u see a lot of shit.
In Spain is the same,a little bit less than italy, but still pretty high, of course no one wants to believe or aknowledge that.
Im curiois is there a subreddit when i can tell me history and ill be listened, because i dont know why, ithink i still have some scars because of my past and im thinking that maybe telling them will help me heal,so maybe someone here knows.
&&It wasn't as simple as 'underage sex'. 

The age of consent is 14 in Italy, so you really have to be a pervert and a predator to get accused of that there.

He was accused of knowingly having sex with a prostitute who was under *18* (which is quite rightly illegal). The girl was 17.

The man is scum in multiple ways, but given Italy's age of consent, I think it's fair to put it in context.

&&We're definitely behind other European countries in many aspects, and gender equality is definitely one of these. I may be wrong (I sure hope not), but my perception of the situation is much better than what your answer portrays. There are of course assholes and people that aren't adjusting well to the change of times, and maybe their behaviour isn't frowned upon as in some other places.

And no, concubines are not common as you think. Men do cook and do chores, generally. I'd say that was true for my grandparents, where the man worked and the woman stayed at home. Now it's completely different. 

Finally, yes, we had Berlusconi. And, incredibile but true, we still do. I have no explanation nor excuses for that. He may have done tons of damage to this country, but only because we let him, so that's on us. 

&&Italian here, two wrong things about this podt:

1) Its ""puttana"" not ""punntane""
2) we dont have concubines, there is nothing even close to that. Some men dont work at all, thats true, but there arent concubines&&I hate to say it, but as an outsider this reaction from Italians isn't surprising (even if, as you say, the reality of everyday italians is different) the actions and statements of high profile figures and certain cliches give the impression of Italy and Italians being very misogynistic. Unfortunately, this incident backs up that view and even herself says ""Italy is far behind the rest of the world in its view of women""&&Sorry to say it, but there's a stigma towards Italy for having somewhat backwards views regarding women. &&Never heard more sexist jokes than when I meet Italians for work. Literally within the first hour of arriving in Bologna, I was picking up my rental car and another driver was temporarily blocking the exit while parking their car in their spot. Definitely nothing out of the ordinary for a cramped parking garage, but the car dealer instantly remarked ""Sorry, can you wait 10 minutes? A wooman is driving! He he he"". &&I think a lot of that is actually due to Spacey's car crash of a statement in response.&&Yeah, going up against Spacey was a far bigger risk than weinstein who the public have no love for.

I think the story would be far different if Rapp had been the only accusation.

There is strength in numbers, one encounter could be seen as a misrepresentation by one party. A trend of stories tends to lend credibility to all of them, even if they may not all be true.

But Rapp had very little to gain by coming out against Spacey, other than getting it off his chest and out into the public. Which would be insane if he were making it up.&&But then it becomes a case of defining 'duress'. 

Is it any time there's an employment relationship, or just when the complainant can show that he/she believed that refusal would be genuinely financially ruinous? Does there have to be an overt threat, or will implied suffice? Does the belief have to be subjectively reasonable, or just objectively?

It isn't that simple, and I can almost guarantee that if a number of these recent allegations go to trial, then it is highly unlikely that they well all result in convictions.&&He actually talks about it all here...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TN09IP5JuI

His father was really abusive, and he has sworn to be the opposite, has taken interests in his sons hobbies, helped build a custom PC with him etc.  

The NFL stuff, he was basically just being degraded by the coaches and stuff, and said screw it, and walked away.

The hot wings episode is great and while I already really liked crews, left me with even more respect for him.&&For the father stuff if I remember correctly he was invited to play battlefield 1 with a lot of other celebrities. A lot of the celebrities played on Xbox but terry decided to get the full experience and play on pc. He didn't really know how the controls worked, but when interviewed he said he had a blast. That lead to him posting videos on social media about how his son wanted to build a computer, and he posted more videos on them building it and playing it. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TN09IP5JuI&&I'm not going to paraphrase or Chinese whisper so-to-speak.

But he chats about it in his interview on Hot Ones, a YouTube show.

Really worth a watch...not just for Terry, but many stars really get real on that show, and it's a credit to the bloke who runs it.

Not plugging it for any other reason than the fact I think it's genuinely good quality content and it's the answer to your question.

EDIT: u/kakarotmaag replied to you with the exact vid&&Terry Crews is like a porn stereotype himself, and the idea that even he has trouble with porn is crazy to me. Real brave of him to speak out about it. &&The Rock and Terry Crews are everyone's spiritual big brother &&He played for the Rams&&Looked myself for an article. [Found this.](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/10/nfl49ers-terry-crews-steve-mariucci/amp) It’s short but it’s something. &&He details it in his [Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TN09IP5JuI) episode. From reading between the lines, he was a mediocre football player for one reason or another but a prototypical athlete so he was tried out by many teams. His last stop was the 49ers in the Mariucci days. During workouts a coach (likely a position coach, not Mariucci) from the team spiked a ball at him point blank and broke/dislocated his finger while yelling at him. At that point Terry decided it wasn't worth it to him to pursue football any further and he took the bodyguard/security path until it landed him a Hollywood career.&&Yup. I can't find any faults in him. He's such a great role model for boys and girls.&&He’s so great. I often turn to his Lip Sync Battle rendition of Vanessa Carlton’s 1,000 Miles when I’m having a bad day. Love him.&&Terry Crews > Chuck Norris&&Fucking cemented as one of the most stand up guys in Hollywood forever in my view. Absolutely incredible display empathy and courage. &&That's fucked up man and it's bullshit that they can hide behind that kind of shit.&&No idea. I guess he left, otherwise he would have probably got the shit beat out of him.

EDIT: Legally, don't know either. Dude probably enjoyed bread and water in the brig for some time.

EDIT2: Looks like someone else knew the doc. Turns out he was a chief or something, got busted down to lowest rank (E1), court-martialed, and thrown in the brig.&&[deleted]&&Yep, 1/4. Thanks for the info!&&How long did he stay there for?&&And then the bravery afterwards to go on video to speak about, knowing that it will be shown to your peers.&&Would like to add that a lot of men don't come forward because the police won't take them seriously.  When those who are paid to assist victims effectively *discredit*, and in turn effectively belittle victims, it creates a chilling effect. The result is that victims feel that if there's no benefit to reporting the crime there's no reason that they should they report it.

It happens often with men who are physically assaulted by women.  &&Hell our society encourages men to just suck it up in regards to all our problems or be mocked and ridiculed at best. This is a huge step in the right direction. &&He's admitted to a porn addiction that threatened his marriage. He challenged the anti-intellectual stereotype of jocks not liking computers, just to bond with his son. Terry Crews is the epitome of a real man and I truly respect him.&&I dream about eating ice cream with Keanu reeves and terry crews then running through a meadow &&Him and Dwayne Johnson look like really nice guys&&The story about how he made money is amazing, I can't find a video but basically he was drafted 11th played on 6 teams in 7 years and by his own admissions wasn't great. But he was/is an Art Major. So he would do paintings of players and sell them to the players. The paintings look like photos at a glance he's really good. So he did that, and then I think worked for a news station for a while doing graphics or something?

Really interesting career the guy has done a shit ton before he ever got into acting.&&He also has spoken out about how bad bullying is in the NFL as a player hoping to make a team. He talked about a coach saying racist ass shit to him for example&&as much strength as he gets from OLD SPICE ODER BLOCKER?&&That was such a heart-warming experience to follow. The pure joy he and his son had when building it was just brilliant.&&I find that hilarious since the character he played on Everbody hates chris was a cheapskate and PCMR's aren't exactly known to skimp out on parts.&&[deleted]&&This needs to happen.  He’d be humble, he’d take the job seriously and work his ass off, and he’d set a great example.

Plus he could do the pec flex thing to cap his State Of The Union speeches.&&Wasn't his middle name like mountain dew or something?&&My sources tell me he is not the real slim shady, I don’t think he’s even allowed to stand up. Neither are you so stay seated.&&Well he probably could but would probably be avg. Just because someone can act does not mean they would also be good at stand up. &&Exactly. Especially if it's someone who has power over you, like his boss that he mentions. 

Even if it's someone you *might* be into in a ""normal"" scenario, the power they hold over you can so easily lead to terrifying situations (and I don't mean for the boss). It's silly to assume because a man is the victim, that it's automatically some fantasy being fulfilled.&&It makes it really hard to hold down a relationship because girls see you as a liability.  &&It’s the power dynamic they can’t wrap their mind around. A lot of big, physically strong men unconsciously have an “escape hatch” when they imagine these situations - that they can stop it anytime they want. For the top 10% of humans in size and strength, being physically overpowered and helpless isn’t a reality we face very often, if ever. 

But in the situation described it’s not physical strength that makes escape possible. It’s actually really hard to imagine it unless you’ve been through it.&&No, that's not how it should be. We should go through due process before doling out punishment or putting people on lists. That's why sexual assault/rape cases seem to go nowhere so often: the evidence necessary to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt doesn't usually exist, especially when there is a history of consensual sexual contact.&&Right? He’d be labeled a sex offender, maybe, because hopefully she would report him! It’s disingenuous to complain women never get in trouble while contributing to a culture that doesn’t even report these predatory women - which is what this is about, it doesn’t matter how masculine you are  report your abusers!&&""and why does it seem like you've never used either in the past decade?""  
""...wanna play gwent?""&&I fucking loved that line.&&He was obsessed with this chick named Sarah Marshall for a long time. Like, he legit followed her to Hawaii when she went there with her new boyfriend, Russell Brand. He claimed it was coincidental.&&At least someone reads my fanfiction &&I'm not sure I do either, broadly favouring unproven accusations of rape is not something I ever expected from Reddit!

Weinstein and Spacey have significance because there's so many voice, there's little room for doubt. Without some credulity sooner or later somebody's going to abuse the power of rumour, just like Weinstein did to swing careers back when he was rebuked.&&Terry Crews is just a great example of what a person should be like.&&And more importantly obvious to the transgressor. But it is about power vs sex. &&From what it sounds like, I think that's probably what the groper was fantasizing Terry would do to him... If your picking up what im putting down.&&On top of that it would be really easy to prove that Terry hit the guy, not so easy to prove the guy groped Terry. Violence is a bad answer kids, not just for moral reasons. &&Yah thats basically a coin flip between a surprised look and waking up sometime later feeling like you just ran face first into a wall.&&There's a big thing *right now* involving sexual harassment amongst British MPs. One cabinet minister has already been fired, and a number of other MPs (across both the two biggest parties) have had the whip withdrawn (basically kicked out of their party). &&Yep giant pedophile ring from what I understand.  A lot of it started coming to light after saville died and people came out about him.&&I mean if it happens between consenting adults, I don't really care what your kinky fetishes are.&&> It can still mean you're a sexual deviant, just not a criminal one.

This is super important though. People shouldn't give fucks about how a person gets down in the sheets (or.. without sheets) if they are not breaking the law(s). Prudish attitudes is what gets us in this whole mess. &&I don't know whether Singer has done anything legally or morally wrong. Maybe he has either slept with underage boys or otherwise taken advantage of vulnerable people and vitiated consent.

But there is definitely a perverse element of homophobia coming up here when redditors are discussing Singer. These people are condemning him for sleeping with 18 or 19 year old men when I'm certain they go home to their basements and wank to similarly aged girls. 

If people without any evidence are condemning him just because he's gay then they can fuck off.&&You can find me in her bed,

DIGGIN THROUGH THAT VERGINER!!!&&In fact, it usually means they can’t know you.&&It's not just what gets upvoted, but also what gets posted. People who have been on reddit long enough know what's popular with the hivemind and just make posts and comments that they think will get upvoted. That's what makes it an echo chamber &&I’ve only been on reddit for a short time, but on many other communities out there (on the internet). You will be downvoted into oblivion for having any sort of opinion that doesn’t appease to the masses. It’s sad that people can’t disagree and still discuss subjects like adults.&&I appreciate that you capitalized Oblivion. FOR THE NIIIIIIINE!!!!!&&And Crews is a likeable guy. If the same situation happened to , say, Russell Crowe the response would be “ Oh, I heard he was an asshole in real life. He probably made it up to get publicity.”
I’m glad there is progress with male assault victims getting taken seriously but I’m not getting too optimistic just yet.&&If it makes you feel better,  Al I have ever heard about Italian men in Italy from any female who went there (half dozen) was the men were extremely vulgar and persistant.&&As an italian, sorry about my fellow countrymen, we aren't all like this, pinky swear.&&/r/confessions

Good luck dude. Spero che ti vada bene. &&I think that a lot of it depends whether you live in north Italy or south Italy. I live in Milan and my perception is like yours. &&Well, Milan is holding a tennis tournament for the 8 best male players aged 18-21, and the group draw was very recently done and [it was a mess](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/06/atp-apologises-draw-ceremony-next-gen-finals-milan).

TL;DR: They wanted to showcase Milan's fame for fashion so they brought out 8 female models who have the A/B group letter ""hidden on their body"", asked the players to choose their ""favourite"" models, and had her ""provocatively reveal"" the letter on her body, assigning the player to that group.

It might not seem as bad as sexual assaults or harassments, but it's definitely a form of casual sexism. It shows the kind of mindset they're in, that this professional group of people somehow thought the best way to showcase Milan's fashion pedigree to these young male athletes and the audience they bring was to have women lift up their dresses.&&Berlusconi's career *(which isn't really finished despite being convicted of paying for an underage prostitute)* is a great example. &&How far ahead is the rest of the world, exactly? Recent events have shown me that the U.S. is a lot farther behind what I thought; my fear is that we're not exactly behind so much as unfortunately normal. I'd love to be shown evidence to the contrary, though.&&It honestly must have taken balls of steel to speak out against such a well known and respected actor. I mean, Rapp could literally have ruined his career with that move.&&Thanks for the reply, I had no idea about the NFL stuff.  I've definitely seen the positive effect with his son from watching his videos.  I'm glad he was able to end the cycle of abuse!  Great man&&Iirc He has a daughter too, and has said even though PC gaming started for him and his son, his daughter is even more into it now than his son is.&&Yeah, Hot Ones seems a little gimmicky but I legitimately think that people forget their shield when their mouth is on fire, so they're a bit more in depth. &&Definitely the best episode of hot ones.
&&[deleted]&&They actually invited him to E3 to play the game. I remember the other celebrities who were playing the game were joking around and talking to the camera men, but Terry Crews seemed like 100% in to the game.&&Not quite.

Psst. We're asking about Terry's father. Like, was he abusive or something? &&Man, seriously nice guy there! Loved watching that. Thanks for posting. It's actually changed my point of view of why he has taken this stand. &&Huge fan of Hot One's, Sean Evans is a great host. &&Sean Evans is a fucking genius, and a great interviewer.

Charged for drugging and raping on deployment if I remember correctly.

He was actually one of our school house instructors when I was in Corps school. Real “moto” and wanted to be a SEAL but got disqualified for color deficiency or something. 

He and I checked into our units around the same time, and I thought it was cool that one of my teachers and I were going to be stationed together. He ended up deploying with 1/4, and I stayed in the rear. When the unit got back, there was a small turn around we were getting ready to deploy again but we had a new chief. Turns out he had been sneaking sleeping pills on Marines and taking advantage of them while they were knocked out.

Edit: when I was a child I reported a teen had sexually abused me, and the cops were like uhhh, ok well... we can't do anything, that's probably not really illegal because he isn't 18.  Friends have had similarly disheartening experiences.  

Rape culture effects us all <3&&This. I have had to talk a man down from suicide after being assualted and abused by his girlfriend. This was college. She was a 5 ft tall/110lb early childhood education major and he was a 6'6, 250 football player/Criminal Justice Major. She beat him, with objects a lot. Drugged him, and threatened to lie and say he beat her. He came from very humble roots, single mom and was African american. She was white and both her parents were IVY league lawyers. 

HE knew no one would believe him. ( He did get help and is a well adjusted dad/husband now) 

She is the type of evil that keeps me up at night. &&The Duluth Model, a feminist theory that has been passed into law in many jurisdictions, states that men are always at fault in any domestic violence situation.  This is why men are afraid to call the cops when DV happens to them, the men will go to jail no matter what.

It's on youtube... he gets interviewed while eating insanely hot sauce. Good watch&&More&&Honestly, Terry Crews is the type of dude who I know has better shit then to hang out in New England with a random Redditor, but all the same I'd still love to buy him a beer&&It makes me love him even more that he came from an abusive family and he refused to be just like his dad and became an awesome father who just wants to bond with his son no matter what. It gives me hope that I can be a wonderful parent some day even though my dad was an abusive pos if I just put all my effort into bonding and loving my kids my way.&&Goddamnit, you’re right! A documentary predicting the future as well. &&Isn't he technically a former future president?&&I’d fucking tune in and watch it. Plus, he’d walk a thousand miles if he could just see you tonight... and maybe bring some cheeseburgers. &&Dwayne Herbert Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho&&Yes.

Isn't he the weirdo who plays with puppets? &&Dost thou attempt to bamboozle, good sir?! &&I came here to murder you &&one might even say he's a stand up guy&&Love/hate the ""like"" systems.&&If he was gay it would probably still be dismissed. Straight men aren't too keen on being groped by gay men so there's some some built in sympathy. With Kevin Spacey it was the first victim being a minor that got everyone's attention.&&Yup- and insistent that that any woman in their lives was to be a replacement for their mother &&Yup..even when walking down the street CLEARLY as a couple, my gf had comments made by aggressive rude di#ks. At a sidewalk cafe we heard it too. Didn't even bother going to a club. For reference, I'm not a jealous type and from NYC so def familiar w aggressive people and how to deal. Loved Rome for the history, culture, food, (and women were def stunning :) but very unimpressed with clowns yelling from mopeds. And yes I know New York has plenty of rude people, just felt attitude and the way men talked to/treated women was particularly in your face&&This is a stereotype. There are many different types of people in Italy. Some are pigs yeah but it's obvious when they are&&Its the same as the whole hooliganism shit too, most of it comes from one VERRRYYY shitty section whereas the rest is fine (well as fine as a country taking steps is)&&If this is the sort of stuff that is happening publicly, with press attendance, then I have no doubt that sexual harassment and assault is widespread behind closed doors, in Italy. &&He wrote an emotional article about forgiving his father too.

If they only knew...&&I remember watching that when it happened, Snoop Dogg had a joint in his mouth and was just walking into a wall&&[Get you a man who can do both](https://youtu.be/2TWpil1VJ8I?t=21)&&Man, he's such a great guy. Definitely a celebrity I'd love to have coffee with. &&And he was probably one of the very few celebs who was actually using the keyboard and mouse.&&His energy is unmatched. Love his vibe&&He was. He describes it in his interview on Hot Ones. You can watch it on youtube, and it's fairly entertaining, I recommend it. IIRC his father used to beat his mom, and that, including the bullying he went through as a kid is what drove him to becoming so serious in the gym and lifting weights; so that he could protect his mother and himself.&&I only know what he said during his appearance on Hot Ones, but I believe he said his father was abusive. He said that was his motivation to hit the gym. &&It's a formula that you'd never pick.

Despite Sean being clearly a very smart and talented in terms of his interviewing skills, I feel like he'd have been wasted and found himself in amongst everyone else in the world of journalism if he went the standard route.

The hot wings are also genius. Such a social activity, that also never fails to bring out the human in anyone.

Super kudos for speaking up. That’s a different kind of courage. I’m proud of you.&&~~ice cream~~ frozen yogurt. &&You got me all hungry now. I’m gonna go grab a ‘gurt. &&Mango yogurt nooooooooooooooooo&&He takes the hot ones challenge like a champ! One of my favorite episodes!&&But what if that's just how 6'5"" man beasts laugh?  He could be entirely genuine, just a physical monster with a natural laugh that matches it. No one should ever be made fun of because of how they laugh. It's a reaction fueled by joy, and that should never be taken away from anyone. &&Dammit, if you just ruined Ballers for me....&&https://i.imgur.com/V91GluR.gif&&I think it’s cause he’s usually playing a douche in his movies, so it comes off fake cause it’s the “yeah, that was a good one, peasant” laugh&&but I thought old spice odor blocker body wash was supposed to give him **MORE POWER**&&I'd like to buy him a yogurt&&This is what happens when you get Barry drunk!&&Aren't all movies that show the future documentaries until proven otherwise?&&Actually no that would be if he never in his life becomes the president, he would then be a former future president because according to the documentary Idiocracy we believe he will be the POTUS in the future, but we actually don't know if he'll really become president since he's still alive and has a life ahead of him.

So currently he is a future former president.&&*President* Dwayne Herbert Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho.

FTFY.&&I chose my words carefully so that I wasn't implying anything about the validity of any accusations, just the provability. It's just the nature of the crime.&&Right. Don’t know if you watch the Orville or Black Mirror, but they both have episodes where there’s a world that revolves around an upvote/downvote system for all facets of life. Very interesting.&&I have Italian friends that were born here that act like this&&Amazing article. 

I can’t help but notice this part, at the end too: “I realized if I had Bill Cosby as a parent I could have ended up in a whole different place, and not necessarily a good one, either. I’ve seen great kids come from terrible parents, and I’ve seen awful kids come from the best parents.”

So much truth in this. What a guy to use as an example, though... (this was written before everything about Cosby came out). &&Oh wow that made me tear up &&That was incredible and really made me think about my own relationship with my dad. So much respect for Terry, it takes a lot to be this self reflective.&&That was the event where Snoop, Zac Efron and Jamie Foxx were super baked. I believe they smoked up in some room and the amount of smoke was pretty intense, even leaking out onto the shared (main?) floor. I remember briefly seeing them on a stream thinking it was funny. They probably had no interest in the event and just made the best of if by getting baked with other celebs. Sounds fun.

&&Wat&&There are other interviews where he goes deeper into the story about that, how on one instance his father  had smacked Terry's mom in front of his own kids. Once they got the kids out of there Terry and his Brother came back and beat the ever living shit out of their dad for it. https://youtu.be/MuaXANjgnZ0

it was intense and he has a good message about what it felt like to finally get revenge on this man who has tormented his mother all his life.&&Kinda like Nardwaur.&&Maybe regional. I'm from Toronto, live in Vancouver, and had never heard 'Chinese Whispers' until someone from the East Coast said it casually at a party, leading to immediate awkward silence in the room. Everyone except the two from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland knew the game as Broken Telephone or Telephone Game, so we had no idea what she was even talking about until she explained it. &&Well yeah, but ""Guy who could crush you down to fit into a matchbox"" and ""Guy who is trained to kill a bitch from half a mile away whilst eating a burger"" have got to be high on the '*why* would do you that' list&&That sounds incredibly shady to say the least.&&Sounds like you/your ex have a pretty serious story that should be heard. 

It’s a story that most seem to assume just happens and is a part of how things are done, it mostly certainly shouldn’t be the norm or just accepted by people as being *“ok”*&&What the fuck.

Report them. Gather evidence. &&Have you seen the DJ Khaled episode? Haha it was pathetic. I think he gave up on the third wing and said something like ""to my fans: if I stop, that doesn't mean I gave up."" It reminds me of Andy in The Office saying ""Andy Bernard does not lose contests; he wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.""&&Apparently they exaggurate his height? Idk.&&Get him drunk one what? 1000% alcohol?

Barry can drink rubbing alcohol and not even feel a buzz. &&At least the house is bitchin’ now. &&Yup, I love Black Mirror.  I like the idea of voting and “likes,” and the freedom and ability of individual opinion of sorts they can provide.... but humans, in general, seem to have a hard time analyzing and thinking for themselves.  Just turns into a hive mind. Which could actually be efficient if you think about it, but it sacrifices much.

The episode in Black Mirror is not one I’d like to see. I fear I’d turn into that creepy truck driver.&&Keeping tradition alive.&&Yeah he was probably referring more to a Huxtable-esque father.&&Man it must be awesome to be super rich and famous and just smoke up at gaming conventions and get paid for it &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lzoHY4MVyM

Haha yeah that's the one.  Been watching E3 since they started showing them on G4, I watch them for the hilarious awkward moments just as much as the industry news.&&Looks like Zac Efron needs to get his head in the game&&The interview where efron and foxx were baked was one of the best things I've seen come out of e3&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ZOeGB9IV8

Some of the other celebrities there were obviously baked too, was pretty funny.&&Not sure I'd put him on the level of Nardwaur without some evidence, as Nard is an absolute beast at deep diving into history and creating unbelievable interview moments with both info AND memorabilia.&&you make it sound like marine snipers are just allowed to murder anyone they dislike. If the sniper in question had murdered his rapist, then he'd have gone to prison and lost his entire career.&&Full mile. &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&>exaggurate &&Its definitely a dream of mine&&5:20 for Terry Crews. &&Alright so I googled zac effron head in the game, was very impressed with his singing, read a comment saying he wasn't actually the one singing in the movie and now I'm back where I started.

25k points and the top of /r/all in just a few hours? I guess it's possible but for a post like this I'm not buying it.

More importantly though are the comments. Jesus it's a promoted post goldmine in here.

""Brilliant!"" ""Thanks for the laugh!"" ""Looking forward to seeing this on my Facebook soon!!"" ""I can see this post blowing up! Can't wait for more!!""

Gag me. Not to mention the same old song and dance from the OP: ""sorry if i didn't do it right, im new to reddit!! hopefully u guys like my post!""

As for the submission itself, I myself do not find it that funny/well done. I'm not saying others can't like it but I just find it odd that THIS post for some reason is getting showered with praise when normally reddit would tear into this type of low effort ""comedy"" (cringe... comedycemetery, etc.)

We saw in Ragnarok how powerful he is.&&Sitting on his throne - full ornate golden armour

Looks sick. Still curious how the fuck they'll balance out time between all those characters.

I'm so glad they brought back Alan Silvestri's theme it's so good.&&Some things I noticed:

-Seems like Loki is stepping over dead asgardians

-Thanos has the power and space stones

-the wakanda battle is pretty much the team that left at the end of Civil War. Maybe Wakanda had the soul stone?&&Spidey’s new suit looks so goddamn cool its a shame it’s probably not gonna last. 

I hope the Hulkbuster showing up confirms that rumor from forever ago where Banner pilots the suit &&It looks like Tony is going to have his own realizations and reflections.

At times I've been bored and even offput by some of the outlying films or TV shows but the core has been an incredible journey and I genuinely hope this is the conclusion that the series deserves.
I'm sure the MCU will live on (what plans are in place beyond this already?) but it will be nice to have a complete saga compartmentalised from Iron Man in 2008 right through to this, the vision to build in so many back stories and plan for future films in the uncertain world of cinema has been unmatched.
Edit: Grammar&&I think that spidey sense arm hair shot pretty much sums up the standard reaction to this trailer.&&who needs sex when you can have trailers&&I am not ready to say goodbye to whatever hero dies in this film. &&Man, this was fucking gold

Human Vision, I wonder what's up with that?

Thanos looks realer and his eyes human-like

Battle of Wakanda looks absolutely astonishing - and OUTRIDERS

""Fun really isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this... does put a smile on my face."" BRING IT ON, BABY

I know people who have no idea that the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy inhabit the same universe at all. I can't wait to see their reactions.

Was I the only one expecting them to say ""Avengers Assemble?"". I really liked each member uttering the words of the first movie.&&I almost thought they forgot about the Guardians for a minute.&&""I've believed in raw hype like this once before...
It didn't scare me enough then... it does me now.""&&Well, would you look at that. For some reason I feel compelled to watch every single Marvel movie again.&&“Someone get this man a shield” 

Best line of the trailer. &&Vision is human 

And looks like wakanda has the last stone &&That whole time I thought that the battle with Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Thanos took place in space. Now I see it was all in New York. This makes me think we still have one more major battle, probably in space with all the Avengers together, and hopefully Thanos will have all his armor on then.&&love the scene where vision is getting mind stone forehead fucked. &&Let's take a moment to appreciate that we are getting a new Star Wars movie **and** the biggest marvel movie to date in the next 6 months. What a time to be alive.&&Pretty sure that was Thanos choke slamming Spidey there. 

Something nobody thought possible 4 years ago. 

God bless Marvel&&Thanos has 2 stones already in the trailer, could this movie really end with the finger snap?!&&My dad raised me on all things Marvel. It was a tradition for us to see each Marvel movie together in theaters. He passed away in July. I saw Ragnarok without him, and now this. Man, he would be so damn stoked over this trailer. We'd be nerding out over it together if he were here. &&Boom! You looking for this?&&Holy shit LOOK AT THAT SUIT&&I haven't been this hyped for a movie in a long time. &&3 hours, 45 minutes to go until I need to see a doctor about this erection...&&WHERE IS MY MAN CLINT BARTON&&I like how how Peter's arm hair stands up to portray his Spidey senses&&[deleted]&&I knew that little shit took the Tesseract.

&&I bet ant man gets real small and goes up Thanos' pee hole and then starts tearing him apart from the inside out. &&1:29 - That's Hulk in the Hulkbuster. No doubt.&&Quick! Look for Sombra clues!&&*""Fun isn't something one consideres when balancing the universe. But this, this does put a smile on my face...""*

&&I just want Thanos to gain all of the stones, snap his fingers, and have half of universe disappear.&&Calling it now, the vision scene is a red herring.

I'm not so sure that the second one will be blue/space, though.  Marvel has played little digital tricks with trailers before.  I suspect that it's actually the red/reality stone.  That way, he'll already have all of the off-world stones when he comes to Earth for the last 4.&&I remember getting excited seeing Hawkeye in Thor and Black Widow in Iron Man 2&&they also have Loki with the Tesseract, which is a minor spoiler since it's left up to debate at the end of Ragnarok (but let's be real we all knew he took it)&&I think Alan Silvestri is doing the music for Avengers 3.&&> Maybe Wakanda had the soul stone

Maybe the soul stone is the conduit with which T'Challa can commune with the souls of past Panthers? &&Yeah. I had to re-watch that again. I initially thought he was handing over the Tesseract because he's just being Loki. But what if he's handing it over to someone (possibly Thanos) in order to stop more of his (and his brother's) people from being slaughtered.&&There's definitely a stone in Wakanda. We've already seen five, so I would assume that the sixth is there. A lot of the trailer looks to take place in Wakanda/Africa, so I'm assuming that's ground zero where Thanos arrives. I think we'll either see it in Black Panther or in the beginning of Infinity War. &&oh no, pls dont let all the asgardians be dead&&I'm guessing a double-cross by Loki where everyone thinks he's betrayed them only for him to betray Thanos in the end, leading to Thanos' defeat.&&how so? Hulk and War Machine are there? &&Where Banner busts out of the Iron Man suit? I always took that to mean he bust out of the Mark 47, not HulkBuster.&&Look at how the Hulkbuster was moving. That's definitely  Banner Hulked out inside it.&&I think the big theory is he will sacrifice himself in some way to save Spider-Man because he sees Spider-Man as the future of the Avengers. Also the whole father figure thing.&&Isn't this RDJ's last movie as Iron-Man anyway? I'm guessing there will be a sacrifice indeed.&&I feel like I'd be more excited for a movie that's just about Thanos getting the stones culminating with him killing Vision to get his. Thanos Quest is one of the best cosmic marvel stories.&&Yeah and I bet a lot of people are about to die. &&Yep, rough plot (speculation) for the two movies.

Step 1: Thanos invades

Step 2: Thanos crushes all resistance.  (insert 1-3 hero deaths here)

Step 3:  Every single hero in the MCU comes together to defeat Thanos.  (this is probably in movie 2)

edit:  I'm told Infinity war isn't two movies anymore.  My bad, I hadn't heard.

edit 2:  Warning to others, lots of comments below this have big comic spoilers (I haven't read them myself).&&then they'll know how I felt when this happened:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ULg4RSy5Y&&Grape you in the mouth!&&Didn’t even noticed, that’s great lol&&I noticed that too.

Cause I have you tagged as such and I think you owe us a good ol' sloppy horse dick eating video. &&I really hope Conan have Paul as guest and ask him to show some footage of the infinity war movie&&The thing is that they don't need to top it. Every superhero movie having a bigger and bigger scale is mind-numbing. Sometimes the smaller stories are more fun, like Spider-Man: Homecoming. The Punisher series on Netflix had a much smaller scope than The Defenders and that's one of the reasons it was better. We don't always want to see cities blowing up and giant space lasers. People fighting for what they believe in is pretty fun too.&&MarvelCeption&&Not necessarily. I mean, more than likely yeah. It definitely *should*. But I could easily see this simply depower him, leaving him a mortal  ""human"" (with a lower power kit), because he spent so much time evolving within, that he won't need the gem to survive.

Now if Thanos cares enough to kill him after he rips out the stone (assuming he survives) is the 64k dollar question.&&They definitely were like ""We only have one recognizable song in our sleeve, and goddamn, we're milking it to all its worth"".

And it worked.

Wouldn't it be a lot weirder if it was one character's song, and not the team song?&&I mean, that's pretty much the look he sports whenever he's *not* busy playing Cap.&&Check Snow Piercer, if you are a fan of Chris Evans.

Loki’s SUPPOSED to be a hero now, so I imagine that’s what’s happening here.

I'm glad we'll get to see them in action there. I was worried they would just come back to the states once the action started. &&Yooooooooooo 

What if he gets the Hulk buster armor to fight, but ends up just turning into the hulk and busts out of it. That'd be pretty sick.&&This would also give us the Uncle Ben dynamic (in a sense) that we never got out of Homecoming.

Ant-Man and The Wasp were probably the coolest part of the trailer for me.&&If we're being serious, they probably left him out because 99% of his shots are with Wasp and they want to keep her under wraps for a bit. &&Oh hey man, he is on Caps shoulder.&&Technically, an image of him was in it though.

Where [he](https://i.imgur.com/GPcKaer.jpg) is essentially the support, partner, and backbone to the New Avengers and Captain Marvel (who will be the new Captain America  as far as positioning in the Avengers). 

Plus I imagine that Iron Spider suit gives him a lot of extra strength and durability. &&Gonna spoiler tag idk [The finger snap happens in the comics during the Infinity Gauntlet arc.

The ~~original cut~~ test screening of Ragnarok had Loki stop at the tesseract, look at it, *and then keep walking*. Test audiences forgot it was in the movie. They wanted to imply that he stole it, so they cut it right when he looks at it. Suddenly everyone assumes he stole it. Mission accomplished.              
                 
>The story I’m about to tell you is nothing about the mythology, just about filmmaking, I was just talking to Hiddleston about this. When he shot that, he had the Surtur skull and he walked by and he looked at [the tessaract] but then he kept walking. And he left frame. And it was like that in the cut for a while. And nobody remembered the moment. It didn’t register with anybody. So we recut it so that Loki looks at it and then we cut away. When we showed that cut, it registered with people who knew what it was. Did he take it? He stopped, what does that mean?  Which was exactly what we wanted the audience to do.

Did you forget Avengers from 2012???

Thanos promised Loki (via his messenger The Other) that if he doesn't deliver the Tesseract, he'll suffer a fate far worse than death. 

Loki is finally out of places to run or hide here, and he happens to have the Tesseract. This is him bargaining for his life.

He has a sweet gig - show up for a week to film Homecoming, make  $15 mil.&&Isn't RDJs fee minimal but he recieves a percentage of the gross? &&I think Cap / Iron Man is going to be one or the other. One is probably going to save the other, sacrifice even with their differences and whatnot.&&Would seem to be a waste of Thanos to introduce him and kill him all in one movie.  IMO.&&My understanding was that the titles are no longer going to be part 1 and part 2, and instead the second film would have its own title. I still think they are going to be heavily connected.&&They're separate in the way that each movie is contained in its own and tells a full story (which naming them Part 1 and 2 might not imply) but it's pretty safe to say it's the same general Thanos story on both, 1 year apart, they were filmed at the same time,... They can't be completely unrelated (well as much as unrelated means in the MCU).

I assume they just changed the name because most Part 1 movies are often seen pretty badly by the public. I mean it was called like that at the beginning and it's not like they will have totally changed the plot of their ""decade in the making"" movies.&&37 year old me still cry's&&[deleted]&&no disagreement from me.

&&I don't know. Homecoming was pretty small scale. Vulture just wanted to sell cool shit to provide for his family.&&Vision needed to be nerfed. His dps was way higher than the rest.&&I agree, but Favreau is the MVP of the MCU simply for having the vision and guts to cast RDJ.&&That’s just his scenes as a force ghost&&DC honestly just needs to make movies. Doesn't matter if it's good, bad, or who's in it; just make them. You can't build a universe if you have three years between Man of Steel and BvS, do a movie that's completely unrelated next (Suicide Squad), then do Wonder Woman and have a ""big team-up"" movie after. And now after Justice League, they want to wait over another year to release another movie?

Marvel initially put out two movies in 2008, one in 2010, but then it was at least two a year every year after that. You can't build a universe without the foundations for it. 

I can look past the quality if they're at least bringing characters to the big screen. But it's baffling to me that Marvel was able to take Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk -- none of whom were really anyone's absolute favorite hero 10 years ago -- and make one of the highest grossest films and franchises of all time. Meanwhile, DC can't do the same with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash, who are already iconic as is.&&Exactly this, the question people REALLY should be asking, is that the Avengers Mansion?! &&BIG DOG EATS MY ASS!&&/r/squaredcircle RUNNIN' WILD, BROTHER&&WE'RE BALANCING THE UNIVERSE ON FRIDAY, MAGGLE&&That is the most Coulson shit.

I don't care who you cast as Shazam or who you cast as Black Adam unless I know the movie is going to get made. I feel like they cast people, gage the public's reaction, then decide whether or not to move forward with the project.

Apparently, Thanos always loses because he sabotages himself in some way. Like, not oversights but blatant self-handicaps. I was actually hoping someone more knowledgeable might be able to chime in on the specifics and whether this is just fan-theory or actual canon.&&He's honestly one of the strongest people in all of the Marvel comic universe. In the comics he's already desturbingly powerful without the gauntlet, but with it he's able to kill nearly half the universe~, but when they wrote him it would be real boring if he was *just* and evil murderer and had nothing else to his character. He kind of intentionally loses. 

It's neat... I have no evidence of this but I think Thanos had a lot of the writers own personality put in him, as in, he's basically *like* a writer. He has all the power to decide who lives and who dies, and he could kill everyone... But he wants an interesting story.&&Basically, and very simplified, Thanos doesnt feel like he deserves the power and so tends to do things that lead to his own downfall.

Maybe after that, a Constantine sequel?
&&“John Wick is a man of focus, commitment and sheer will. The stories you hear about this man, if nothing else, have been watered down.""&&John Wick is great. But Keanu Reeves has been an action star since the late 90s, not to mention a few action flicks in his pre-Matrix years.&&The most memorable part, for me, didn't even have Keanu in it...

__________

Viggo Tarasov: I heard you struck my son.

Aurelio: Yes, sir, I did.

Viggo Tarasov: And may I ask why?

Aurelio: Yeah, well, because he stole John Wick's car, sir, and, uh, killed his dog.

Viggo Tarasov: [pause] Oh.&&With a fucking pencil&&I honestly think he already was being remembered as ""one of the greatest action stars of all time"" from The Matrix Trilogy. These awesome John Wick movies are just a bonus and more proof he still the shit.&&Slightly off topic but Speed is one of the finest action films I've ever seen... It still has me at the edge of my seat...


The bus jump physics is awful though...&&Point Break, Speed, The Matrix and John Wick. 

That has to be one of the best bodies of work in mainstream action cinema. 

&&I love Keanu as an actor. I love the majority of his movies and John Wick 1 and 2 were amazing. I also hear he's a pretty decent human being.&&I love him. He’s not a creep, keeps his life private and has remained level headed in the face if extreme tragedy. I only wish him the best. &&I AM AN F.B.I. AGENT!&&I watched this movie on a 10 hour flight. I watched only this movie on the 10 hour flight.&&Don't forget Johnny mnemonic!&&If you think about it Keanu has kind of defined the action movie in the post-die hard world. Point Break closed out the extreme 80s style and elevated it to greatness. Speed was the pinnacle of 90s action and cribbed from die hard in brilliant ways. The Matrix is obviously the absolute pinnacle of the 2000s and it came out in 1999. Influenced everything. And now John Wick. Keanu rules. &&Not many people have seen it, but my favorite Keanu performance is in Man of Tai Chi where he plays the bad guy. Keanu directed the movie, and although he isn't the main focus, it's still a great martial arts film.&&Is the 2nd one worth seeing or is it one of those ones that doesn't live up to the hype?&&People misunderstood Keanu's acting style Keanu Reeves is not  ""wooden"". He's essentially a character actor who got cast as a Leading man.

The devils advocate ,a movie starring him and Al pacino, The story behind it gives great insight into why Keanu is as a great actor

...When making The Devil's Advocate, Reeves agreed to take a big pay cut of a few million dollars  so the producers could also afford to bring on Al Pacino..... so that proves my point....coz Al  pacino....RIGHT.


The  realism  of his portrayals  is often  often mistaken for ""blankness""  by  film critics and fans.What keanu really does  is playing his roles as if they are  ULTRA REAL, COMPLEX human beings.

Take this  [scene]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLc8JIGyUKs) he is able to convey complex emotions through simple gestures.

He can play a genuine, realistic character in just about any role, except for those which require good dialogue delivery,realistic emotions,nuance or appearing in front of camera or  on stage.


&&Keanu was already solidified as one of the greats with The Matrix, Point Break, and Speed. &&Any more so than the Matrix did?&&An article made for /r/movies.&&I personally like him in Constatine. &&Best part is how everybody knows John

Oh hai john&&For those who don’t understand the context of the article - this is an A.V. Club feature called History of Violence where the writer picks the most important action movie every year (starting from 1968) and does a write up on why he thinks it is that. He’s been doing this once every two weeks for 1.5 years and they’re all good reads. Shame it’s ending soon as he’s almost caught up to the current year.

One of the few reasons I️ was still going to A.V. Club after their site went to shit (aka Kinja).&&Speed, Point Break, do you know what I'm not even gunna do this there was like ten other movies that were huge. He's been one of the greatest action stars since the Matrix came out.&&Point Break, Speed, Matrix.  John Wick is just icing, he already had 3 action classics under his belt. &&I'm not taking anything away from this movie but the Matrix solidified this almost 20 years ago.  John Wick has a pretty unique twist combining gunplay with grappling but the Matrix is iconic in ways that John Wick will never be.&&love the movies.

and I remember hearing something that made me enjoy them even more:

basically, the movies are a combination of two things:

1) they are shot like they're a live-action graphic novel. By which I mean that each shot has very few, if any, cuts and changes of camera angle, especially the action scenes. Each shot looks like a frame of a graphic novel, except come to life. Same thing with the dialogue. It's all sort of one-liners and catch-phrases, you can almost imagine those shots as being frames in a comic with a stylized speech bubble reading those lines out

2) it's a tribute to the classic martial arts movies. They purposely follow certain clichés and tropes. Like the final boss battle in the dark, in the rain, with the big-boss head of the baddies after defeating all the henchmen. It's like an old-school samurai movie or kung fu movie.

If you keep those two things in mind when watching them, suddenly they become stylistic masterpieces. Like how The Magnificent Seven is a cowboy-western remake of 7 Samurai, or how Star Wars is a sci-fi tribute to fantasy stories (knights, wizards, dark lords, farmer-is-the-chosen-one, etc.). When you watch John Wick with that sort of mindset, it really gets more enjoyable. Suddenly, when Keanu Reeves gives sort of cheesy lines like “People Keep Asking If I’m Back, And I Haven’t Really Had An Answer, But Yeah, I’m Thinking I’m Back.”, it sounds SO much better if you imagine it like something Batman would say in a frame of a gritty graphic novel.&&No it didn’t.

Matrix did&&It also solidified the black turtleneck as the ultimate tactical garment.&&Point Break solidified Keanu as the greatest college QB turned FBI agent of all time! &&This article is part of the series ""A History of Violence"" written by Tom Breihan.

*edit: Fixed 1977&&what's so awesome is that keanu is kind of a real badass with guns in real life

there's no shaky-cam, slow-mo or cgi bullshit.  that shit he does in the movies is basically real (with respect to shooting, I dunno about the hand-to-hand)&&I think Point Break, Speed, and The Matrix already solidified him&&Apart from all of his other great action films since Point Break&&God I would kill for a Constantine sequel.&&Constantine: Chapter 2 Verse 3&&They are doing a Justice League Dark and Constantine is part of that team so unless they cast him in that, (which I'm completely on board with) I don't see it happening.&&I'd actually like a Constantine prequel as well, but it would be kinda weird if an older Keanu played a younger Constantine.&&I've been reading that Constantine could be John Wick 3, but the idea that all of Keanu's movies could be mashed together as one big storyline as he realizes that he's been bending reality and that reality is a lie is growing on me.  Bill and Ted, Speed, John Wick 1/2, Constantine,  leaves the growing insanity for a day job, Matrix 1-3.  Thoughts?&&There was a Constantine show. For a serial TV show, it was good, IMO. Worried at the start it would be a poor man's Monster of the Week show, but it redeemed itself. Definitely a different cup of tea from the movie, though.&&YES, PLEASE. I absolutely loved Constantine and I even tried picking up the Hellblazer comics to get more. It's a real shame they didn't come out with sequels soon after the first movie. &&Funny how you can say the same for Keanu Reeves.&&That is probably the best opening to any action movie ever. &&Both Bill and Ted's were huge action spectaculars.&&I’d say between Point Break and Speed he was a lock. &&Point Break? Johnny Utah ain't no slouch.&&Pretty much. For me his ascendancy was as the Kung Fu Christ Neo&&Yeah, Speed was a massive movie, but The Matrix was just in a league of its own. Some of the most iconic action scenes ever with Keanu doing real ninja shit. John Wick just confirms that he's still got it.&&Is OP 15yrs old? Keanu has been a megastar for a long time.&&Yea this article just needs to say “One of most badasses ever, makes another hit movie”&&>John Wick solidified Keanu Reeves as one of the greatest action stars of all time

No one ever accused Keanu of not being an action star, in fact, quite the opposite&&So many great lines with so few words that deliver so much.

""hi John, working tonight?""

"" 'fraid so""
&&What I love about the first film is that John Wick didn't do anything to build up the intimidation factor that he has. It was done by all the other characters. EVERYONE knows him and what's he's done/capable of. To me, that's better story telling than John Wick telling us how badass he is.&&This was such an amazing way to give people a sense of who John is without a lengthy backstory. &&I think what sells it is he doesnt say anything else and just hangs up. No punishment , no reprimands, just a soft ""Oh"". &&[Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8fq9noIBso) (Youtube 0:39)&&I loved the scene right before that too when John Leguizamo's character stops and goes ""WHERE DID YOU GET THIS CAR???""&&R.I.P. Michael Nyqvist :(&&and I love the slow burn through the movie where Viggo's son slowly realizes over the course of the movie that John Wick really is the guy you send to kill baba yaga and becomes more and more desperate.&&One of the best exchanges in any movie ever. The Wick movies are just full of them too. This is one of the few movies that actually lived up to all the hype I heard about them.&&That and the pencil story.  A fucking pencil.  ""Penseeal""&&I don't even think it's the best ""oh"" moment...i like this exchange better....

Viggo Tarasov: It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to.

Iosef Tarasov: Who? That fucking nobody?

Viggo Tarasov: That ""fuckin' nobody""... is John Wick. He once was an associate of ours. They call him ""Baba Yaga.""

Iosef Tarasov: The Boogeyman?

Viggo Tarasov: Well John wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman.

Iosef Tarasov: [stunned] Oh

And that exchange defines John Wick. At first the son is like ohhh ok, Boogeyman he is a bad dude. But when he finds out that this is the guy who kills the boogeyman, then he knows the gravity of his fuck up. 
 &&I also loved the exchange with the cop.

""You, uh, working again?""

""Nah, I'm just sorting some stuff out."" &&Best scene lol.&&I fucking loved this scene. my friends and I went into this movie stoned and knowing completely nothing about the movie. we all turned to each other and went ""who the fuck is this guy?"" especially after he got his shit rocked in the opening scenes.&&RIP Michael Nyqvist&&Ya... That 'Oh' was ""Well. When he gets home I'm going to strike the fuck out of him too.""&&I like when he called John Wick and had a whole conversation to himself. 

Then when he hung up and Mayhem asked, “what did he say?”

“Enough”. &&[deleted]&&Who does that?&&It's arguable for the Matrix since the 2nd and 3rd movie onwards were CGI-heavy. What made John Wick shine was that he did his own stunts and it made the whole action scenes look even better.

It's on situation when it pays to have an actual action star with former stunt men as directors. The only other movie I know that has it this good is The Raid 1 and 2.&&The amount of time & effort he put into training for the Matrix is astounding. Wick is a good follow up though.&&“It’s an incline”.  Yeah, and you’re in a big ass bus. &&“25 more years of this and you’ll get a shitty pension and a cheap gold watch.”  

“Cooool.”&&""Cans! It was just cans!""&&That's why it's so awesome. Because the physics make no sense&&Speed was my favorite movie growing up, probably simply for the fact that I shouldn't have been watching it 

I always love the part at the end where they're fighting on the train and he looks up and looses his head&&I thought he was perfect as Constantine as well. Also, best devil incarnation ever. &&Cruise has Mission Impossible franchise, Minority Report, Last Samurai , War Of The Worlds, Oblivion, and Edge Of Tomorrow... granted, some of those toe the line between Sci Fi and traditional action, but I don't think the two have to be exclusive &&He has a motorcycle shop that builds some pretty badass custom bikes. He seems like a super chill dude. &&He's an absolute gentleman who's been through some really tough shit&&In the screenplay for Point Break the line is ""I am an Eff Bee Eye AGENT!"" Spelled out like that. So... He read the line the way it was intended, haha&&I know! Ain't it wild?!&&Johnny Mnemonic, John Wick, John Costantine, what's with Keanu playing Johns?&&Listen. You listen to me. You see that city over there? THAT'S where I'm supposed to be. Not down here with the dogs, and the garbage, and the fucking last month's newspapers blowing *back* and *forth*. I've had it with them, I've had it with you, I've had it with ALL THIS - **I want ROOM SERVICE**! I want the club sandwich, I want the cold Mexican beer, I want a $10,000-a-night hooker! I want my shirts laundered... like they do... at the Imperial Hotel... in Tokyo.&&Came here just to say this. Loved his acting in that movie.&&I'd say it's far better than the average action movie but not quite as good as the first one. But it is a sequel to one of the greatest american action movies (imo) of the this decade so it's hard to live up to.&&Not as good as the first. For some reason every bad guy -every single one- thinks it's a good idea to run up to John Wick rather than, you know, use their gun to shoot him from a distance. After the 150th dead henchman it was tiresome. That happened in the first movie too, but the took it up to another level in chapter 2. 
 
Oh, also literally everyone on Earth is an assasssin.&&In my opinion the second one is noticably worse than the first, there's a lot more ""unbelievable"" super hero situations and moments whereas I felt in the first one he really was just the worlds best assassin. It's still worth a watch though.&&you bastard&&>He's essentially a character actor who got cast as a Leading man.

I somewhat agree with you. A friend and I saw Neon Demon recently and by god, he was so convincing playing a pedophile rapist, it depressed the hell out of my friend since she really liked his character in John Wick.&&Yup! Totally! Agreed! 

Wait... yeah.. &&Kenneth Branaugh cast him in Much Ado About Nothing. Kenneth Branaugh does not cast you in his Shakespeare movie if he thinks you are a lousy actor. &&I did not kill his dog! I did not!&&Yeah but did Neo kill someone with a pencil? I think not.&&Yeah, he's amazing at 3 gun. You can see the competitive shooting influence in the 2nd movie. He even uses 3 gun equipment and reloading techniques throughout the entire catacombs scene.

I was impressed at how accurate they were.&&I loved 47 Ronin as well&&God:  I would kill for a Constantine sequel! &&Fan theory: Constantine is a sequel to the Wick series.&&Would you kill a God for a Constantine sequel? &&I thoroughly enjoyed Constantine without any knowledge of the comics. The style was so through and through, the parallel hell world where everything was burning just like a post nuclear blast, the characters etc all just blended so well.  

Kinda reminded me of how they nailed the style in The Crow, and I'm not really into that style of movies really. &&That's definitely never happening.&&Constantine is played by Matt Ryan on TV, so he is most likely going to reprise the role in Justice League Dark&&He’s probably the only guy in Hollywood who could pull it off. You know with being immortal and all that. &&Keanu doesn't age, though.&&[deleted]&&He actually said in a interview I saw that a fear of his was a tombstone with nothing but ""He played Ted""&&Woah!&&Dont forget The Replacements. That was some edge of the seat stuff right there.&&Caught my first tube today, sir. &&Seriously. Speed is one of the all time best action films&&Point Break & Speed were sort of exceptions to the type of movies he was doing around then though (My Own Private Idaho, Much Ado About Nothing, Dracula etc.) It wasn't really until after the Matrix that he was solidly seen as an action star.&&No, he is an EFF BEE EYE AGENT&&Make it two&&We gonna jump or we gonna jerk off?&&i think the Matrix is arguably the most influential action movie ever.  Literally every action movie since utilizes at least some of the techniques it brought to the mainstream in the West.&&Perhaps you don't remember just how massive Speed was.&&My husband and I saw The Matrix three times in one day in the theater. We just kept going back in, then we saw it two more time with co-workers, and than saw it 2 more time with friends and family. The Matrix was as much about the action and acting as it was about the technology that made it what it was. Not only that but it just felt different. It felt like the future of movies when it came out. &&Yeah the article is an opinion piece saying he’s now one of the “greatest”. Not that he’s an action star&&""Why don't you take the night off?""

""Thank you sir.""&&It's like what you would say nervously to the reaper, if you were mildly acquainted&&Fraid so Jimmy

Well i'll leave you to it, night John

Night Jimmy &&How about his phone call with Viggo:

Viggo Tarasov: I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry. My condolences. It's, uh, seems to be fate, or happenstance, or just bad fuckin' luck caused our paths to cross once again.


[John says nothing]


Viggo Tarasov: John?


[John says nothing]


Viggo Tarasov: Let us not resort to our baser instincts and handle this like civilized men to move on...


[John hangs up mid-sentence; Viggo puts down his phone in a resigned manner]


Avi: What'd he say?


Viggo Tarasov: [pause] Enough.

&&""Are you here on business, sir?""  
""'Fraid so, Francis.""&&A fucking *pencil*.&&A great example of that was 7ft bouncer for a mafia club shitting bricks when Wick approaches him&&Wick is a big example of show, not tell. They also work very hard to keep the story extremely simple, so they can focus more on the worldbuilding. &&On a different spectrum than Jason statham in spy.&&That's what I loved about it as well. They don't force feed you the story and history. We enter into a story that's been going on for a long time, these characters have all interacted in the past, they have all gained their reputation at this point, and that's reflected in their interactions. &&Everyone indeed.

""Hey John.""
""Hey Jimmy.""
""You uhh, working again?""&&I agree with you and with the first response poster who stated that John Wick is a “show, not tell” type of character, and it is the surrounding characters that tell provide the mystery and intriguing details that make the character intimidating.  Legends come from people telling stories about others, not directly from the legend’s mouth them self.  

Another film that does this very well, also with a hitman character, is Boondock Saints.  All of the surrounding cast tells of how dangerous the hitman Il Duce is.   

And furthermore, yet another film that does this well The Usual Suspects and the legend of Kaiser Soze. 

I very much enjoy this kind of storytelling. &&The risk is when the main actor can't live up to that incredible build up.  After those scenes, our expectations were too high for any mortal actor to fulfill, and then Keanu Reeves did it.  This made him legendary.&&Yes. It is an expanded version of Trautman being Rambo's hype man in First Blood&&There's also that part with Francis, where him and Wick are having a polite conversation and Francis agrees to step aside because he knows how dangerous Wick is, it's a nice little moment in the film.&&This is a classic device in screenwriting. Want to make a character cool, scary, or intimidating? Make other characters talk about how cool, scary or intimidating they are. Examples are Keyzer Soze in The Usual Suspects, or Regina Goerge in Mean Girls.

It’s a hit-and-miss way to build up a character, and fortunately in John Wick it worked really, really well.&&> EVERYONE knows him and what's he's done/capable of.

Except for.. you know.. the guys who broke into his house, killed his dog, and stole his car.&&That and the intro -- it was almost certainly inspired from the opening scene from Up.&&I play Warframe, which just gave players the ability to name weapons.   I name my rapiers ""Pen-ceel!"" ... a few dozen people have gotten the joke now, its excellent. :D &&Its the ""Oh"" of ""Oh fuck me this is gonna *suck*.""&&He then beats up his son for doing something sooo stupid that words cannot do it justice. &&What sells it for me is that until he says ""Oh."" he is acting like your run of the mill final villain of the movie, ominously looking over the city with his back to the camera, and then the moment he's told his son fucked with John Wick he loses all veneer of being sinister and is like ""Well. Shit.""&&I think what really sells it is John Leguizamo's performance.  Viggo is doing the whole badass mobster thing, calling and with disturbing calm, asking why Aurelio hit his son.

Given the context and what movies lead us to expect, Aurelio should be shaking in his boots.  He should at least be concerned, carefully trying to make clear that he respects Viggo and wouldn't normally do such a thing.

But that's not his response.  Not only does he know that he's in the right, but he knows it with such certainty that he doesn't feel the need to mince words or couch his explanation in apologies.  The tone of his response says, ""Yes, there's a good reason I did it, and once you hear a one-sentence explanation as to why I did it, you're going to agree with me 100% without any more discussion needed.""&&And Leguizamo's set up for it is great - his character is visibly nervous/scared by the phone call, aware that punching the son could be met with serious repercussions and he probably shouldn't have done that.&&John Leguizamo is in this!?

Now I'm sad =T&&whoa whoa whoa... back up.... what? when did this happen?!&&Fucking Theon Greyjoy&&Alfie Allen earned his money in this one.&&Also to add to this, I also love how fitting Viggo's son's death was written. He didn't have a glorified blazzing death, instead he was easily snuffed out at the mercy of Wick.&&[deleted]&&That babayaga part on the second movie, and the one with the pen &&It was kind of cheapened by John Wick being called Baba Yaga, because Baba Yaga is female witch that looks like [this](https://i1.wp.com/msolongo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Baba-Yaga-work.jpg).&&I always wondered about that. It wasn’t just his reputation. I got the impression that he did some off the books work for the local cops, and they let him be because of it. From the looks of things, John lives in Jersey someplace. Maybe he took care of a local mobster who was wrecking the town, and the local cops were grateful about it. &&Weeath a FOOKING PENSIL. &&https://media.giphy.com/media/JFZYCCbVHpDsk/giphy.gif&&Like, seriously&&The Raid is so goddamn good. &&ahve you ever watched legend of the drunken master?&&He put *work* into John Wick and John Wick 2.

I fully believe Keanu Reeves is a dangerous man with a gun, camera not required.&&/r/bitchitsabus&&He was a great villain. Simple premise, simple needs. No destruction of the world. &&I always wonder what the backstory is of the lady who was carrying cans in a stroller...&&By that logic you are gonna love bollywood.&&Even better than Al Pacino in that movie Keanu was also in, whose name escapes me at the moment? Devil's Advocate I think? Even better than that one?&&Cruise gets a lot of hate, but honestly the man is such a phenomenal actor.
I rarely leave his movies disappointed, and his range is amazing.

Complete douche bastard of a person, sure, but an amazing actor. &&WHY ARE YOU FORGETTING COLLATERAL?

One of the finest gunplay scenes in cinema, courtesy (again) from Michael Mann of Heat fame. 

[The scene in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3mkYDTRwgw)&&Top gun is action right? 

Jack Reacher series was alright as well. &&I mean, when you're named Keanu what name would sound exotic to you?&&This is where I am with it. It's not as good as the first one, but it's still a very good action film and well worth the watch.&&I agree with the everyone running into the meat grinder, but I was curious about the world full of assassins. Was it literal, or was that fear an paranoia setting into Wick, seeing everyone that way? &&The everyone on Earth thing really ruined the movie for me. Took away the magic of the first. &&Don't forget if you are a nameless assassin you always die in one perfect shot but if you are an important character you and John constantly miss each other.&&That’s the point though. This guy supposedly did an impossible task that we really still don’t have any idea what it was. Now he got dragged back in pretty much and the only way for him to stay alive  is to complete another impossible task &&Afterreading all that and then this comment I thought I was about to get rick roll'd. &&He did really solid job of making me uncomfortable in that role.&&I know the OP is a joke, but everyone should watch The Gift. If not for the great movie or Cate Blanchett, then to see Keanu being a really great douchebag m.&&I get the impression that part of why Keane Reeves is chosen for such big roles is that he's an unusually decent guy for a Hollywood star and a pleasure to work with off stage in all the other ways, which add up if you work with him closely for the time it takes to make a major film. Daniel Day Lewis and several others are brilliant actors but they're extremely stressful to work with. Being a nice guy actually can go a long way. &&Oh hi doggie&&Bro Neo jumped INSIDE of someone and made them explode. Neo wins this one&&Constantine: I would kill God for a sequel!&&I saw a thing here on reddit that proposed John Constantine was actually John Wick after he died, sent back to Earth by God to fulfill his mission. The way the writer laid it out it was somewhat convincing.&&Impossible task indeed.&&From what I've seen of reviews of that movie, you *only* enjoyed it if you didnt know the source material. It also seems to have aged really well in people's opinions... used to be hard to find someone else admitting to liking it.&&https://m.imgur.com/gallery/sVa5KJq&&I'd bet my left nut they won't cast him because they don't like to mix tv and movies &&Tv and Movies of DC aren't connected like Marvel's Agents of Shields and Netflix shows so it probably won't be Matt Ryan&&I'm glad you realize this too. Those posers over in r/onetruegod think that cage is immortal when really it's Keanu that they should be revering. &&Also probably the only one left after all these scandalous scandals....

Don’t crucify me but I actually liked *Speed 2: Cruise Control* well enough.

ftfy
&&Thank you Kevin Nash&&That scene still bugs the hell out of me.

When he tells John how much weight he has lost, he says ""двадцать килограм"" (20 kg). That converts to 44 pounds.

The **translation** says ""Sixty pounds."" He lost more weight in English than he did in Russian.&&***DEATH WALKS AMONG YOU***&&Jimmy carefully moving his hand away from his gun during that scene is the best part in my mind. Without the dialogue ever shifting away from what sounds like a totally casual conversation and their obvious history with each other it’s still perfectly clear he is scared/respectful enough of John that he feels the need to show that he’s not a threat. &&> a *fooking* pencil

FTFY&&Even better is how he tells him to just walk away and the bouncer thanks him. Lol&&The part where it clicked for me that John Wick was someone special was when the cop shows up to investigate the gunfire at Wick's house. First they greet each other by name. Then as they talk, the cop *sees* a dead body in the house and then just politely nopes right out of there.&&DIESEL!!!!&&But they do tell... This whole scene is a whole lot of tell. It's great, but it's telling, right? &&> Wick is a big example of show, not tell. They also work very hard to keep the story extremely simple, so they can focus more on the worldbuilding.

This is where the second movie stumbles, it shows too much of the assassin underworld to the point that the mystery is unraveled, so the interest behind them ends up waning. &&That was Jason Statham just making fun of Jason Statham innall his other movies. &&IMO the best Statham's performance since Lock, Stock... Dude can act when they let him.&&Spy was so much better of a movie than I ever thought it would be.&&He was great in that movie&&Everyone does, it's more fulfilling. 

When you ""tell"" instead of showing, you simply say ""John Wick was a badass"" but you never show us any examples of him *being* a badass.   In a film, this would be John Wick going from bar to bar saying ""yes, I'm a badass, I kicked the ass of three guys in a bar with a pencil.  Can you believe that?"" 

As an audience, no, we can't.   We never see him in a fist fight, we just see randos in a bar that don't even know Wick agreeing that they don't want to fight him.  

It feels inauthentic.  

In contrast, in John Wick, *he* never says anything about being a badass.  However, other characters *react* to him with great deference.  Characters who are shown to be badasses.  We see Aurelio, a character with a chop shop that is parting out a goddamn GT40, become frightened that John Wick's car is suddenly in his shop.   We see him strike a guy that we've already seen is somewhat of a badass and doesn't cower when one of his cronies points a gun at his head.  But he's terrified of John Wick.  When the head of the Russian mafia calls him because the guy he struck is the son of that mob boss, Aurelio explains why he did that.  Then, this titan of the underworld, a guy we don't have to infer anything about, simply says ""oh"".  It's obvious his son has fucked up big time and there is a very good reason he got hit.   I should also point out that Aurelio was wary of Vigo, but he was outright terrified of John Wick. 

John Wick never told you he was a badass.  The other characters showed you through their actions. 

In advertising, there's talk about the three levels of advertising and their effectiveness.  The first is direct.  This is when I tell you how great my business is.  This would be the equivalent of a cold call.  It works sometimes, but it's not very effective.   This is what poor writers and screenwriters do. 

The second is indirect, like an advertisement.  This is you driving by on the freeway and seeing a billboard for my product.   It's much more effective, but in the back of your mind, you know I paid for that advertisement and there's no real substance behind it.   A mediocre film would show John Wick kicking a bunch of rando's asses in a bar.  We wouldn't know them or know how competent they were, but we'd see some flash and be excited.  A lot of movies and novels use this kind of storytelling. 

The third level is recommendation or word of mouth.   This is when your friend comes up to you and tells you what an awesome business I have.   This is *extremely* effective if you can get it and is one of the most effective forms of advertising there is because it feels very sincere.   This is how John Wick is advertised to the audience.   We can tell he's a badass because of the way people interact and react to him.  People we've been shown already to be badasses themselves.  It reinforces the idea that John is very special.   Twenty minutes into the movie, we've never even seen John in action, never seen him throw a punch, never seen him fire a gun -- yet we know *exactly* what to expect when Vigo sends his best men into his home. &&They were young, sons of a mob boss. They hear the legend but they didn't experience it. They are the quintessential male looking to establish their dominance at an early age by barking up the wrong tree.&&And just like Up, a dog gets involved...&&Wait, where do you go to rename weapons?&&should i download Warframe? from what im hearing this free to play is the tits&&I really need to watch these movies don't I? &&Reek (paraphrasing): I can fix it father, give me a chance.

Father looking incredulously at Mayhem:  did he not hear a word I just fookin said?! &&What sold it for me was that Aurelio straight up tells the Boss that he did it. 

But then he hesitates.  

He nearly cannot tell the mobster: your son stole John Wick's car and... killed his dog. The tragedy of those words make him stutter. Wick is coming for the son. And he will kill him. And you cannot stop him. But you will try. We both know you will try. And die as well. 

Oh.&&He is and he is great in it (albeit a very brief role)&&Whenever Eric Roberts dies, he's gonna have like 75 active movies in post-production. That dude puts in WORK. Check out his [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000616/)&&Don't smoke cigarettes kids&&A few months back, cancer.&&Alfie Allen is in serious danger of being typecast... that's two characters now who were the spoiled idiot son of a powerful man and fucked everything up.&&I always loved it too. You can _feel_ the gratitude when he says “thank you, sir”. &&It gives you more of a sense of who he is. He’ll cut someone a break if he can. The Fisher King also told a similar story about when he and John met in an alley, and John gave him a choice, which also happens later with Common’s character. &&That shot is so good, it’s well acted, and even the subtitles are creative and interesting. 

What I love about the shot is how it captures both men. You see Francis standing there in the front left with more lighting. While Wick is behind him to the right but further back and with less lighting and clarity. Then the gun ties both men together in the middle. The shot shows interesting depth and contrast between the characters.

The actors kill it by nailing a subtle familiarity. The conversation doesn’t have anything more than it needs and is quite funny. The subtitles are creative by using different fonts, colors; and by putting them in the middle of the screen so you can naturally follow the dialogue without taking focus off Wick.

There must have been a lot of thought that went into that scene. It’s incredible knowing that the director was a stunt man before this. 

Edit: speaking of great camerawork, the whole [club scene](https://youtu.be/3eeWjiBVgCE) is amazing. All the action is in frame. None of that ‘cut away on the hit’ BS. No shaky cam. And the camera flows with the action so well. I wish more action movies looked like this. &&The resigned ""Shit, I'm dead"" look followed immediately by the ""Oh wait, I'm going to live"" side-eye speaks volumes. &&I just realized that was Kevin Nash &&for a long time i assumed this film was probably ridiculous and not in a good way.

now i see that i was wrong. this film needs its own evening, a large glass of bourbon and some good friends.&&a fookink peeenceel&&[The pencil sequence in John Wick 2 was one of the most memorable parts in the movie for my friends and I when we saw it in theaters. Such a huge payoff moment.](#spoiler)&&The cop slightly raised his hands as he backed away, as if to say ""If anyone asks, I have no idea what they're talking about. I'm not in your way."" 1 part respect, 1 part fear.&&The cops are on the mob payroll. Jimmy gets a few bucks (and keep his blood inside his body) to look the other way.

THWACK! *heavy breathing* HWA HA AGhh HWA HA"" &&Gah, if i could relive seeing that movie under the same circumstances when i first saw it i would. It was the day after finals and i randomly saw a YouTube add for it. Thought it looked awesome and i needed something to zone out on. I got to the theater late and missed the opening segment...this meant i had NO idea who the main character in the police force was. The level of stress was insane and that hallway knife and baton fight scene just blew me away. I ended up watching it 2 more times in theaters. Movie changed my expectations for action&&Was gonna say, doesn't Jackie Chan do most of his own stunts as well.&&Devils Advocate: Smarmy excitable humanistic Italian devil

Constantine: smug discontent sludgy Swedish devil

Both are pretty good. &&Yes, much better in my opinion. Peter Stormare is incredible in the role. 

Spoiler alert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9Rxx6QNqQI&&I'd venture to say Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate and Peter Stormare in Constantine were both great and memorable devils in their own right. Stomare's devil is creepy, weird, off-beat, and just so irreverent. Pacino plays the lawful, calculating, insidious, devil with the endless rage boiling beneath.&&> I rarely leave his movies disappointed

If Tom Cruise is in a movie, there's a 95% chance it's good. I like to give him shit, but he almost never makes bad movies. And even the ""bad"" ones are completely watchable.&&https://i.imgur.com/zjF1JgU.gifv&&Woah.&&it was done with a literal sense that everyone was an assassin, everybody, I would guesstimate about 130ish people, during the scene the user up there is talking about has the same motorola early 2000's burner phone, the rest of the movie is still pretty good but that was my one big complaint about the sequel&&It really did. I thought the Continental was supposed to be some super-secret society of top-level assassins. There's no point for it to even exist anymore since everyone is in on it. &&The reason the first movie is so good is they made it very believable that John could pull off impossible tasks.  He does the impossible tasks in the movie through incredible skill and determination.  He is an incredible marksman and hand-to-hand fighter, and that's why he can take on so many people.

In the second movie, in the opening fight for his car, he gets hit by a taxi hard enough that it sends him flying.  He immediately gets up and starts fighting again.  No amount of skill or determination would make that believable, so the illusion of believability is broken.&&[deleted]&&> Constantine: I would kill God for a sequel!

With a fucking pinceel.&&Idk how that works because Constantine talks about growing up being able to see demons. &&Semi-related. Has there ever, at all, been a far fetched theory about a movie that has been confirmed to be true?&&[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/79fvp8/watch_john_wick_1_2_then_watch_constantine/?st=JA41L8DZ&sh=9dec8617) might be what you’re talking about. &&Not quite -- I enjoyed it *despite* knowing about the source material. I was not a huge fan of the comic character. Yes the KR version was very different, but it was a *great* story and we should have more like it.

I'm waiting for a multi-season gritty version of the Dresden Files. Not the shitty campy bullshit they had on Sci Fi channel, but a real dark *murder the people you love to save the world from hell* type series.&&I read the comics and still loved the film. I just had to do a slight brain adjustment, read it as some story of alt-verse Constantine, and all was well.  I watched it recently, still holds up.
It probably helped that I'm a Keanu fan too.
I'll agree that Matt Ryan's Constantine is much truer to the character/comics though, so I enjoyed that in a different way.&&Cage is a sub deity.&&[deleted]&&Actually, CPR from Keanu is 2 minutes of resuscitation and 3 hours and 98 minutes of lovemaking. So checks out.&&Do people not know that he moved to directing and writing?&&> ""He played Bill""

They didn't put his name as the writing credit because he didn't write the story, just the dialogue.  This was before he was famous, back when he was just one more writer in Hollywood.&&> Dracula

I'd recommend watching it again and pay attention to how hilariously over the top it is with just about everything -- acting, set design, camera techniques, story. Also, not sure if this is just the plot or if the director just got bored of Keeanu's character and acting because he's not really in the story after the first quarter of the film.

Also the only film techniques they used were those available around the time that film was invented!

The good book Wikipedia has some deetz on this:
    Coppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as computer-generated imagery when making the movie, instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema, which he felt would be more appropriate given the film's period setting coincides with the origin of film. He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son Roman Coppola. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer generated effects, but were created using on-set and in-camera methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of compositing, were instead achieved by either rear projection with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through multiple exposure by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using matting techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. Forced perspectives were often employed to combine miniature effects or matte paintings with full sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics.[12]

&&You pretty much just described reeves movie career. He was in a ton of movies that should have been garbage but some how turned out to be decent. The lake house or the replacements to describe a few.&&I lived through both, you are right. The Matrix is it's own beast and still holds up rather well (opinions about sequels notwithstanding) while Speed is ok to rewatch now and definitely didn't have the staying power in comparison.&&The Wikipedia URL for Speed used to be /the_bus_that_couldnt_slow_down.

**""BACON""**&&***DIE DIE DIE***&&Also the idea that the cop knows that John will do far more than Jimmy ever could to keep collateral damage to a minimum and keep any civilians out of the problem. 

In my mind Jimmy retreats to the nearest chokepoint on the road and just randomly pulls over any known neighborhood citizens that might go towards the house as a delaying tactic to let John do his dirt.&&A fooking penseal.

In other movies, repeats like that usually feel forced but here it was perfect, IMHO.&&Not really. At least, not in the sense that the writing advice means.

Show don't tell isn't about visuals vs. dialogue. It's about putting the information in the work and letting the audience piece it together on their own, as opposed to just directly giving them the information. It's about whether or not you treat the audience like they can think for themselves. The scene is showing, because rather than just have characters say that John Wick is badass, they demonstrate it for the audience by showing the effect he has on other people.&&This scene specifically is showing that Wick is a well known figure. They're not saying, ""Wick? John Wick, the legendary assassin?"" You can feel that there's history behind that final line.

On the other hand, a little later we get a scene with both. With papa Tarazov telling his kid about John Wick. But this is balanced by punctuating the statements with cuts to Wick, emphasizing what is being told.&&Yes, but it wasn't the regular blatant exposition, it was beautifully integrated in the plot.

Most movies: ""This is John Wick, the most dangerous assassin in the world""  
This movie: ""He stole John Wick's car, sir, and, uh, killed his dog"" ... ""Oh"" 
 
Same purpose, entirely different delivery.&&They're not telling you what John Wick has done, though. They're showing you how people react to John Wick, implying what he has done, and leaving the inference up to the viewer. They let the viewer come to a conclusion based on character interaction, they don't tell the viewer what to think by spelling it out.

The movie does do telling scenes, like when they tell the story of how John Wick got his nickname of Babayaga - but that serves the story by being literally a tale about ""a boogyman"", an unknown thing that you only ever hear stories about.

It's not a perfect film, mind. There's a few expositiony scenes, but it gets it right for the most part.&&This scene is an example of how to tell by showing. Instead of the characters saying something lame like “I hit your son because he pissed off the single most badass and ruthless assassin in the underworld by stealing his car and killing his dog” we get to see many characters strong reaction to the simple mention of the name John Wick.&&I have to disagree in that being a stumble. As we see more of how one world functions, we get glimpses into a sort of rival underground where the rules are completely different. 

The interest shifts, sure, but doesn’t wane. &&Apparently they disagree with you. &&The second movie makes me want more.&&> innall

Its a fun grind but anything you want in game is a grind if you want it for free. &&Yep! Its the fairest free-to-play that i've ever seen, and the gameplay is pretty damn good.  You can get every Warframe weapon via earning it yourself, although you can also outright buy what you want.  

The in-game currency goes on sale semi-frequently (You can get 20, 50, or 75% off as a daily login reward) - $50 at 75% off will buy you every single warframe, and a large chunk of the weapons if you wanted to go that route.  

Apart from that, all the things that you can ONLY acquire with money are exclusively cosmetic.  Earning things only requires that you grind for materials (which has no daily limit / time limitation associated with it) 

Building weapons / warframes takes between 12 and 72 realtime hours (Which still passes when you're logged off) but you can push a 'I want it now' button for the premium currency, but even that is fairly reasonable.   

Assuming you got a 75% off sale and spent $50, thats 4300 platinum.  Warframes are usually 225 platinum, rushing an item build is typically 25 platinum.  (Thats less than 3 bucks for a warframe, and pennies for a rush)

OH, and there's frequent sales in-game on things as well, so you can get both a sale on Platinum *and* the thing you want, if you're patient. I've paid as little as 50 cents for a good weapon.

The graphics are pretty dang good too (Old gif, they've improved since this https://i.imgur.com/00d3A9Z.gifv) 

Also, I love the origin of the game, which was some guy telling the developers ""You can't make something like this for that cheap!"" To which they replied, ""Fuck it, I'ma do it anyway."" and have gone on to trounce AAA titles from other studios that charged a ton more.  &&Yes.&&Oh god, they're so much fucking fun. There's a whole wonderful assassin's underworld mythology that is built around the story. It's never explained, but you see it happening all around you. It's just fantastic storytelling and violence.&&Dude....&&Yeah, I'm going to have to watch it again now :)&&Dude, yes, please do yourself the favor. I think they have to be my favorite action movies of all time up there with The Matrix. I have a man crush on Keanu.&&Yes. Because everyone in both of them, who sees John unannounced after his long absence from ""the life"", regards him (and this is a testament to great directing) exactly the same way: as if the Grim Reaper himself has just entered the room. 

The only possible explanation for his presence and attention is that you've been pencilled in (pun intended) for an impromptu visit by the Angel of Death. The fact that you are already within his line of sight means it's too late now. Whatever chance you had of escape or flight has vanished. Your best hope is that he has come to question you about whatever bigger fish he has to fry, because if you happen to be that fish you were dead long before you knew he was there. 

You may as well have been bitten by a Black Mamba.&&Yes.  Yes you do.&&Yes&&While you're at it, add The Raid Redemption to your list (watch with Indonesian voices with subtitles)&&Yeah, like right now&&They're two of my favorite action films!&&Drop everything and watch it now!&&Where the fuck have you been. Please list all movies you’ve seen since John Wick 1 came out (sept 9 2014)  so I may taunt you a second timeh &&""You will do nothing because you *can* do nothing.""&&As brief as he is in both movies, every scene he is in is great and adds to the movie&&That's the great thing about the film though, even the small parts are perfectly done.&&What makes it even better is that when Francis turns towards him, John lowers his gun. And you see that Francis has a clear 12"" on John. Yet despite the lowered gun, and Francis' clear physical advantage, he still doesn't even *consider* trying to overpower Wick. He just thanks him sincerely.&&My favorite has to be the babyaga part at the beginning of the start of the second movie where Peter Stormare is telling the story and his minion guy cuts him off and is like ""I know I've heard the story"" and Stormare is like ""Who the fuck does that?!?!"". &&An incredibly minor point I appreciated about the subtitles: when Wick tells Francis he's lost weight, the subtitles give Francis' response as ""over 60 pounds"". But what Francis actually says is ""двадцать килограммов"", i.e. ""twenty kilograms"" -- because of course Russians use kilograms, not pounds.

Thought it was nice that the writers thought both about what Francis would say, and how best to translate it for the American audience. [There's the issue that 60 lbs is more like 27kg, but it's not like Francis' estimate was claiming to be exact anyway.]&&It's weird. I know he can act, dude was a pro wrestler for YEARS. But I had no idea he could act *that* good.&&[deleted]&&One of few scenes in recent movies that had me audibly getting excited in theater. I uncontrollably started a combination of ""oh shit oh shit"" while maniacally laughing.
 &&A peencil never loses reception&&Found the Thatcher main.&&I know you're making a joke but the soundtrack in The Raid is awesome.&&I saw it from the beginning, and I still didn't have any idea who was who or why anything was happening. &&Jackie Chan is definitely one of the greatest action stars as well. I'd put Tom Cruise up there as well even though I'm not that much of a fan, still gotta show respect where it's earned.&&I love when Constantine flips him the bird lol.&&Fantastic scene. This movie gets a lot of hate but it's one of my all time favorites &&If you're talking about memorable devils, may I recommend the current [Lucifer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/) tv show.&&This is a good example of internal vs external consistency in world building and the impact it can have on a story. 

Impossible things can happen in any story world, but the less externally consistent they are (fit with the real world) , the more internally consistent they need to be. If there is no internal reason to explain an impossible thing the event gets compared externally, to our only other frame of reference, the real world. If it fits there, the illusion of the story remains intact, if it doesn't fit the illusion is broken for many. 
&&I mean maybe for you. What made the first one so good for me and most of my friends was how over the top it was. The premise is he goes after the Mafia over a dead dog. He's nearly killed several times in the first movie and barely scrapes by (Deus ex Dafoe happens atleast twice). It's not realistic at all in my opinion, but it doesn't have to be. It's kick ass and its fun. The second one is miles ahead of the first one in that department. To me and what I enjoy about the series, the second one is better.&&We did it reddit!&&You missed the part where he said after attempting suicide he became an international assassin for a while. &&To be honest it's been a long time since I'd seen the movie, so if there was something like that in there then that would have to be explained.&&Well shit, I think we've all seen demons. Just not the kind with supernatural power.&&Reincarnated by being reborn would do it.&&I don't know.

I still refuse to believe that Jar Jar Binks was *not* a Sith though.&&God yes, we need Netflix to do a good Dresden files&&>I played it up so he would continue giving me mouth to mouth.

a man after my own heart&&3 hours and 98 minutes is just over 4.5 hours.&&I didn’t! Hope he’s successful.&&Nothing that anyone has heard of.

Most people remember Bill and Ted as ""Keanu Reeves and that other guy"".&&Found Alex Winter’s account.&&I only know him as one of the street punks in Death Wish 3.&&[Freaked](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/) is one of my favorite comedies. Keanu also starred in it with Winter, uncredited, as [Ortiz, the Dog Boy](https://youtu.be/UYXmCZxSeFI?t=1441)&&Lost Boys, and I believe you're correct. &&Shall we take this conveniently parked bus in order to chase him down?
&&""Fuck me""

""Oh darn""&&This is really cool. I never heard any of this. Awesome knowledge.&&Keanu and Sandra Bullock carried ""Speed"" -- with the Matrix Trilogy, Keanu didn't carry those films himself. Matrix was loaded with top notch acting talent.&&I was going to make the obligatory ""tore his quad walking away"" joke, but I'll refrain this time.&&***Omae wa mou shinderu***&&Lmao whats funny is that all of us understand that if such a member of society existed the liberties he has had wouls be understandable due to his history and circumstances. John Wick the movie also does a good job normalizing the not so normal.&&Hard to get rid of that swedish accent&&Ah facking.  Pain.  Sell.&&Wat da fack am ay ganna do wit a carvan with na wveels&&I've always loved imagining in my head what happens next with him after this.  Like, is he married?  If so, he shows up back at home and his wife is like ""What are you doing home so early, you're supposed to be at the club all night."" and he just gives a look and replies ""John Wick."" and even she goes ""...oh.""&&Was francis russian? I mean it's not a russian name and I kinda thought he was american. && ""No, just sortin' some stuff out.""&&Username checks out&&It's the immediate switch from ""I'm about to murder you for touching my son,"" because NOBODY fucks with the boss's son, to damn-near fear and practically saying ""yeah, you should have hit him for that""&&I always felt the cop was too young to know about Wick. Or, at least, an older cop, huge and rugged, would have given it more teeth. Just an opinion.&&Noise complaint?&&Wow that was a really great explanation of how that saying applies to this example. &&I agree with this in this specific scene, can't really remember other scenes. 

It's also about their behaviour and facial expressions when he says it was John Wick's. The look of pure terror. Looking at this scene, even removed from the movie, would give anyone the idea that John must be badass. And then being Russian (?) AND scared of someone just furthers the intrigue; ""this guy must really be fucking special""
That's just how I understand it. &&One of my favorite scenes from John Wick 2 is when he goes to the Roman Continental hotel. The owner there nervously approaches John, sits him down, and quietly asks him ""...Are you here for the pope?"" To which John, somewhat amused, says no. But a wave of relief can be seen in the other guy's reaction.

Speaks volumes about what John is capable of and how the assassin's community view him as an almost unstoppable force sometimes.&&They indeed show the fear people have instead if having Wick go ""fear me"".

Am a real fan of the work they do, the implied mythos of the universe, the story in its pacing and integration to its world, cameras cuts that remind you of comics.

Theses movies don't get the praise they deserve imo.&&“Let me introduce (very attractive main character), they graduated from (prestigious university) at the age of (impossible) in (more than one smart sounding degree), so they are very smart! I’m now going to explain a very simple scientific concept they should already know for the sake of the audience.”&&And sometimes, NOT showing is more effective than showing. The whole back story of the series involves this impossible task. (The second movie adds a little bit of detail on it, but still keeps you in the dark).

Showing the impossible task would essentially ruin it, because it will never be as cool as your imagination.

For another, albeit more heavy handed example of the same trope, see the first episode of season three of Sherlock.&&Even then, they don't really even give you much to piece together in respect to why he's so feared either. They almost just give you how people react to him and leave it up the the audience to wonder why. Build him up in your own head without really knowing why.

I always wished they'd delve into his past but I also think never telling it is what makes him so interesting. It's all just tales and imaginings as if it was in the real world and it isn't spoonfed. &&Even that scene doesn't really feel like an exposition dump because he has a understandable reason to be telling his son the story.  He's got to spell it out plainly to make his knucklehead son understand.&&Even then the exposition feels natural, at least to me. For example, the scene where Viggo gives us a fair bit of backstory for John. It's done in the guise of Viggo explaining to his son the magnitude of his fuck-up.

Even then, we can almost see that Viggo knows he can't stop what's coming and it serves to further build the mythology of John Wick as this unstoppable force.&&Exposition isn't evil. It's absolutely necessary in most movies. &&It's not like it wasn't hinted as the obvious direction in the first film, should a second be made.  The hotel, the coins, that whole thing, if he kept going it was clear what we were going to be seeing.&&Yeah, that's how I felt.  Rather than doing the standard action movie sequel thing (let's just try to do everything the first movie did, but worse) they gave us some more solid action scenes and expanded on the mystery of the criminal world.  Was it as good as the first?  Nah.  But I think it's better than most action movie sequels and gave us something a little different.&&For me, the mystery of the world in the first film was like a tease. I really wanted to know more about this world, and I feel like I got that. It was a world I wanted to explore and JW2 gave me that opportunity.

It was similar to how I felt about BR2049. The first Blade Runner film introduced us to such an interesting world and I wanted to dive deeper into it. That film scratched a similar itch for me.&&I think the weakest part of the 2nd film is Fishburn. 

His character seems forced. Where Wick's character is molded by how the other villains react and respond to him, Fishburn's character has to explain who he is in the world and why he's so badass and I believe it clearly cements the difference between the two forms of story telling. &&I don't mind, I still like the movie regardless.&&I'm partial to his role in Snatch, idk why.&&I played it a lot for a bit and then realized how bored I was.&&or you can wait till the third one comes out, watch all 3 back to back, and then call your doctor cause your erection hasn't subsided after more than 4 hours&&They're making a TV show about the hotel.&&>It's never explained  
  
It's so refreshing to have a balls-out action movie that doesn't treat you like an idiot.&&As someone who loved The Matrix, idk why I haven't watched John Wick.&&And this is a perfect example of why ""Oh"" was so much better than some long explanation. &&Yes but also the raid 2. I think its even better.&&Ye better hope he's not holding his kid or something. &&Dude has been an asset to everything he's been in, IMHO.
&&Neither does a 6-inch blade&&There’s dozens of us. Probably. &&I worked at Blockbusters when it was out on DVD, so many customers were iffy about it cause it had subtitles, we just told them to turn them off cause no-one gives a shit about the dialogue.&&I understand letting Tom Cruise slip through the cracks as counting as an action star, but he’s who you thought of second after Jackie Chan??&&As a standalone, it's actually really good

But it pissed off the fans of Hellblazer

Though general consensus even amongst them seems to be, ""if only it hadn't been called Constantine"" &&Red! ddeitsilvern&&People have such limited attention spans these days.&&Master of the drunken sithhead style.

Dudes too much of a shithead that it *has* to be an act, he somehow always managed to significantly affect everything around him by tripping on his tongue and breaking that one thing in every room lol&&> I still refuse to believe that Jar Jar Binks was not a Sith though.

[Partially confirmed by the actor](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-the-darth-jar-jar-binks-theory-is-partially-true-says-actor-a6923351.html)

>>> ""I will say this, it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen. No matter how long it takes.""&&You mean mouth.&&I think he was actually after Keanu Reeves&&He's just that good.&&It just keeps getting better.&&He's currently directing, producing, and writing a film based on Frank Zappa which I will most definitely be seeing

&&I remember him from Lost Boys too &&""Bogus!""&&RIP, you got me.&&Don't forget he's also one of Kiefer Sutherland's vampires in Lost Boys!&&*Get ready for rush hour*&&Keanu carried the pre-cursor to the Matrix films with my personal favourite KR film, Johnny Mnemonic &&While Reeves and Bullock are great, its a real stretch to say they carried it, and the its more than 'ok' to rewatch as the guy above you posits - Speed is a classic in its own right.

The concept alone is golden, its got iconic actions scenes in it like the elevator sequence at the start, the bus jumping over the gap in the highway, and Jack attempting to dismantle the bomb while being dragged behind the swat van. Not to mention the orignal score is classic, the support cast are aces and Dennis Hopper nails it as the villain. 

Okay it didn't change how VFX are done and wasn't as influential but surely those are not the sole characteristics of a great film. &&That was a sad moment in wrestling history.  Completely derailed the NWO in the WCW/WWE merger.&&I NEED HEALING.&&I agree, the subtext is that there could be a whole movie just about how Jimmy and John come to the understand about being John's local cop and how Jimmy fucks up some stuff and John shows that he's got his back and will keep the people out of the fray.

It's great how basically every small character's interaction with John feels like there's a huge story where they got comfortable with John the killer also being a polite and trustworthy dude.&&I mean it's not coming back now&&the deal was ya baht it like ya sawr it!&&He probably tried walking away, but blew out both quads. &&I always wondered if Viggo had him killed or anything. Like he's supposed to be there protecting Viggo's son and John Wick shows to kill Viggo's son and the guy just walks away. Is Viggo mad that he betrayed his duty, or is he like, ""No it's fine I mean realistically what could you have done?""&&francis is a saint in catholicism. &&""Ah, well...I'll leave you be then. Good night, John.""&&Watching the movie for the first time was a real treat. These lines were spot-on hilarious.&&You should have hit him for that, and I'm going to hit him for it more later.&&I actually like that he was so young. It implies that Wick is so notorious that cops even talk about the myth that is Wick. Imagine being so absolutely good and terrifying in the art of killing people, that the people hired explicitly to take care of these threats, have decided it's better to let you work unimpeded. &&It's hinted that the cop knows the underworld and John Wick's reputation, hence why after he sees the dead body, he asks if John Wick was ""working again"", since everyone in that world knows that John Wick got out of it because of his wife.

This gets magnified in the second movie and when he asks John what happened to his house, he didn't even question his answer being ""gas leak"".&&... Noise complaint. &&All in all, John Wick is badass...no matter how many words you put on it.&&It would have been more awkward NOT showing the inner workings of that world than what they did.

&&I love that the world is like Harry Potter for assassins. The hotel is like Diagon Alley. You can get your weapons just like getting your wand. You can buy clothing like your robes/cloaks. As someone who really normally wouldn’t enjoy this type of film, that part made it for me. &&Definitely. Nothing’s really going to match the first, and I don’t think they tried. They went a new direction with it, and expanded on the world they built. &&> Was it as good as the first? 

It's also pretty damned difficult to follow up when the first one was so damned good. It's a lot easier to make a sequels to a mediocre movie and have the sequel match or improve, but they really had nowhere to go quality-wise but down. (And I agree it was only a small step down.)&&Probably because it's a very different role for him.  He's not an action hero in it at all.  He's just some dude who accidentally got involved in something so out of his depth that he didn't even know about what was going on.  He doesn't shoot anyone, doesn't hit anyone.  He just talks and makes bad plans that never seem to quite work out.  I like it.  Way more interesting that way.&&I'm still erect.

It's been sex weeks.&&There was a cool idea I've seen here: watch first two films and then Constantine. Some things actually fit in the sense of continuity(combat prowess, respect etc.)&&Oh, so their gonna ruin it huh?

Edit: there, their, they're&&Haven't heard about this, what's the name?&&Every moment you haven't seen John Wick should be a moment of wishing that you have seen John Wick.&&No just my dog. Poor thing broke its neck so I'm coming after you u/Con_Dinn_West&&Imagine how much more Super Mario Brothers would have sucked without him...

*shudder*&&I really like him in Chef.&&God: Please don't kill anyone Reddit - You'll probably get your sequel. &&what did you say about people?&&And he convinced the Senate to agree on something&&He should probably write, direct, then produce it instead.&&As a long time William Gibson fan, that film makes me cry. It’s just so bad compared to the short story it’s ostensibly based on. 

New Rose Hotel got an awesome film adaptation though. 

I did rewatch Johnny Mnemonic a few years ago, and it’s a better film than I remembered it being, but it’s still a horrible adaptation of one of the founding pieces of the cyberpunk genre. &&Wait what? Fuck!!

*double checks*

Peter Stormare is still alive at least. But still!&&Is fo me mum&&dammit... take your upvote.&&I'm sure Viggo assumed he was dead. He didn't really have enough time to verify who exactly John killed before he came for him.&&Goodnight Jimmy. &&yeah, I watched it now like 4 times. It's good. Really good. The second movie was bigger but it didn't feel like such a treat. Still really good and makes me look forward to the third one. &&Yes I get where you're coming from. He's been told all about that guy on Primrose Street. Didn't he know the cop's name though? I thought that was odd. Anyhoot, what a film.&&The cinematography was breathtaking and the immersion was higher in the second. 

The fights with common and the drink together after were poetic. Common pursuing him further to establish his true supremacy against John, and being handled accordingly.

The emotional investment in the first is king to me however &&You can't be surprised twice and they knew it. That was half the fun of the first movie, the build up from the other characters and then the house scene happens and you're like, ""Holy fuck this is awesome!""

They couldn't replicate that and didn't try, and that made the movie better than it could have been. &&The worst movie sequels usually tend to try to recapture whatever the first one did. It’s almost always better to expand or deviate instead of repeat. &&How many weeks?&&A perfect Freudian slip.  
Like when I meant to say ""pass the sugar"" to my wife.  
  
Instead I said ""you stupid bitch, you've ruined my life"".  
  
Oh how we laughed.&&>sex weeks

I don't see the problem here.&&> It's been sex weeks.

I suspect this is related.&&I took that guy's advice, and didn't really feel it. John Constantine and John Wick are similar characters, but still too different. For example, JC is shown to *really* want to go to heaven, while I don't see JW caring as much. Other thing ruining continuity was that JC was damned for his suicide attempt, the thousands of people he would've capped in his life if he were JW didn't seem to exist, despite the the obvious gravity of such sins. &&Oh  ~~, so their gonna ruin it huh?~~&&Yeah, probably. I've learned to not get my hopes up for anything anymore. &&Trump Tower&&Here's the news about it.

I sprint to the bathroom, come back, and he's like ""there was a first order spy who saw them at the bar"". I'm like alright cool didn't miss much. Then he goes and for the 1 minute he's gone it's the freaking lightsaber flashback scene AKA I barely understood what I was watching, let alone be able to explain it to him quickly in a movie theater. He came back and all I said was they found Luke's lightsaber. After the movie I told him there was actually an insane flashback (flash future too?) that was super dope and that he could not have picked a worse possible minute to miss in the whole movie lmao &&It's adult diapers, then.&&I went to the toilet during The Force Awakens, during what scene?

It wasn't clear to the audience what was going on or why. &&Yea, I wish there were a scene or two that would have shed some light on what was happening in the galaxy. I'd love an extended scene of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rDhP-pOSYs&&Rogue One needed 20 extra mins, showing us 1) Bodhi's escape, and 2) a bit of Chirrut/Baze backstory.&&Yea, I feel that a new hope did a pretty good job of letting the audience know what was going on in terms of the Empire’s goals with the Death Star. The conversation in the Death Star command room with all of the moffs and admirals did most of it. That scene showed that Jedi have long been considered wiped out and that the Death Star was supposed to bring an end to the imperial senate. Once planets were scared of complete annihilation they wouldn’t be able to resist not being represented in government, making the empire a complete autocracy. The scene didn’t force it on the viewer, and it wasn’t too long. &&I never wanted to admit it but I had a hell of a time wrapping my head around the politics of the prequels. It took me more than one viewing to make sense of it and I'd welcome anyone who could explain it all more clearly in one of the films.&&Even 1 minute of background info would have helped.

However, if you had *any* credits, the director had to be credited first, since Hollywood practice then and now held that the director was the actual creator of the movie. The Directors' Guild decided that the Lucasfilm title card at the start of *ESB* counted as a credit for Lucas, so he was violating the rule.&&I drink constantly during the day and probably pee every hour or two.

I drink a lot of water over the day but when I go to the cinema I pee there before the movie and again right after. That's not witchcraft and most people seem to sit through a movie just fine.

My brother and I did that prior to the release of The Hobbit and that was a straight-up odyssey.  Were it not for the brief breaks between movies, spending about 12 hours in a movie theater would have been an experience I'd be hesitant to recommend again.&&Except for a few rare cases, these cuts weren't viewed in movie theatres, so people had the ability to pause to use the rest room or get more snacks.

That said, as long as the story is good, I'm perfectly fine with the length. Plenty of other great movies have been 2 1/2 hours long and didn't feel like it. It's only bad if the pacing drags.&&> ""IT'S ~~THE EYE~~ OF THE TIGER""

&&The sea wall sequence near the end of blade runner 2049 with the rushing water really made the 3 hour runtime painful.&&I'll never forget I went to see Inception after drinking a ton of something, I don't remember what.

The theater I was in was sold-out packed, and we were in the middle row of the middle of the theater. Even before the previews were over, I had to piss like a race horse.

But instead of getting up and walking through the aisle, my social awkwardness kept me in my seat for the entire 2 1/2 hours of the movie. I didn't want to annoy everybody by standing up and walking in front of the screen.

Chris Nolan makes my favorite movies, but I hated Inception I think partially because I was in such physical pain when I saw it. I still to this day haven't rewatched it.&&My local cinema still does them with stuff that's unusually long.

The first two Hobbit movies had intermissions and I think I remember  the Hateful Eight having one too.

Helps them sell more popcorn and people are happy because they don't have to hold pee for 3 hours, so it's a win-win.&&Man, as much as I love the trend of movies being longer these days (good movies anyway) I wish intermission would make a comeback. My theater has assigned seating so don't have to worry about losing a seat anymore, and it sure would be nice to be able to stop and take a leak without missing shit.&&probably cause everything is digital now and they don't need to change reels anymore&&All theatres in India have intermissions.

It's safe to bet that they won't put one at the end of TLJ as well. Personally I think it's best to leave that to Marvel and the comic movies as it fits the cliffhanger format of the source material better than the Star Wars saga.&&Yeah exactly. I remember my brothers, who aren't as die hard Star Wars fans as me, said they hated TFA for a number of reasons, but one reason was they didn't understand what was going on politically. At first I tried to explain it by saying ""it all makes sense if you read the books!"" but then I realized that you shouldn't have to read 5 books to understand a movie. Any good movie explains what's going on in its story, especially an epic like this, without you having to have any prior knowledge. And TFA kinda failed in that way. I like the story, minus Starkiller Base and Rey seeming like a Mary Sue, but it would have been so much better if it did a better job of explaining things. I know a lot of people hate exposition or whatever but again, there are effective ways of doing it and you can't just not have any exposition at all.&&That's what happens when you try to ignore the prequels and copy ANH.

I got to see the Raiders: Adaptation that a bunch of teenage fans filmed on betamax in the 80s. It was a shot-for-shot remake of every scene, including burning shacks, dragging each other in front of cars, snake pits, and a really genius way of recreating some of the special effects, like the ghosts at the climax. The only thing they left out was kicking the guy into the airplane rotor. They can't release their film, but they do have permission to tour it for events at different art house theaters. There's also apparently now a documentary on Netflix it.

The latest one I've seen was for The Hateful Eight. Before that it was Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Quite a big gap.&&The only time I saw one was during one of the Harry Potter movies.

But if The Force Awakens, The First Order strike first, blow up several planets and... it's not very impactful or memorable. &&Could you sum up what's in the books in a brief way?

There is plenty enough wrong with the prequels without dragging the politics down. I loved the politics in Star Wars. &&If I had three wishes one of them would be to have Daniel Stern as my life narrator.&&Fun fact: The Wonder Years premiered on 1988 and was set 20 years earlier in 1968. If it were made today, it would be set in 1997.&&I read it in Gilbert Gottfrieds voice&&[deleted]&&If anyone deserved such an ending though, it was that trilogy.&&They probably still had their hotel rooms in New Zealand for another month so they decided to film more.&&And they didn't even include the re-taking of the Shire in the movies, it could have had another movie all on its own probably just for the post ring destroying and the Shire.&&At least it's accurate to the books. The Ring is destroyed before the half way point of Return of the King, by page number.&&CoS had an intermission? What?&&The Yellow Note.&&As someone not even in their 30s yet, all these comments make me feel so much better. I always feel like I'm the only person to ever leave for a quick bathroom break. &&I'm same as you but lots of people can't go that long. They need like a camelback for piss.&&[removed]&&Wasn't that just for the 70mm screenings?&&What was it?!

I saw it on Netflix and don’t remember any cool intermission.&&They do it in live theater still and it's fine. &&Newb. That’s why you keep one of your beer bottles and piss in it covertly. &&They need to install like, the portajohn urinals in the back of the seat in front of you! Genius!&&You may need to see a urologist&&I love getting old.&&The CGI being bad in such an important, huge budget movie in 2017 is absurd.&&i honestly enjoyed batman v superman more, the warehouse scene was miles ahead of anything in the entire justice league movie.&&This is every DC movie. Even WW was amazing right up to that last awful fight scene which ruined it, imo.&&I haven't seen it yet, but I feel like it's evident that it's a film designed *solely* to make money in the sense that it's sequel bait.  I already KNOW it's sequel bait, because the main villain is **Steppenwolf**.  Fucking STEPPENWOLF.  Not Darkseid.  Not even anyone remotely memorable.   So it's clear to me that they just want to make more movies.  Which would be fine if the goal was to make GOOD movies, not just $$$.&&5-7 is too much? I'd say I drink around 10 a day, definitely more sometimes...&&[deleted]&&I'm like, Machete, this guy gets it.  Then I see Weird Al and fucking died&&That's a.. novel arrangement. Although I feel like adding Weird Al to hatchet deserves a different name, because ""machete"" tells me you added Danny Trejo in there somewhere.&&Wouldn't you put rouge one before 4, since it's an exact lead in?&&No holiday special?&&Doesn't Machete put R1 at the beginning if it includes it at all? Going between 3 and 6 is really weird, because it isn't that closely connected to either.&&I always hold that new watchers should just watch the movies in the order they came out (4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, R1) and if you've already seen them all then either watch them in that same order or watch them in the plot order (1, 2, 3, R1, 4, 5, 6, 7).&&Tom Haverford?&&Along with smoking copious amounts of grass too&&One tennis ball a day, the others stayed huh?&&It was a TUMS festival! 

Oh wait.. I mean
 AT-ST, AT-ST AT-ST!&&AT-STs! &&Much better than an AT-STD&&Well from my perspective the Jedi are evil. So believe what you want about cap&&The balls on Marvel...trolling your own audience that you've groomed to stay after the credits.&&Immensely accurate point. One planet feels FAR more devastating than like 5 lol. At least make them some planets that we'd seen before or something. Make one Jakku or Naboo. Find a way to make a least one a big deal lol. The random scared people was so insignificant it was almost laughable. Did they expect us to care about them?&&Sure, let's see... after Return of the Jedi, the war between the Rebels and the Empire went on for another year. The Rebels formed the New Republic with Mon Mothma as Chancellor (no more Supreme in the title). The Battle of Jakku was the end of the war. The Empire was defeated for good and there was a peace treaty signed between the New Republic and the Empire. The Empire agreed to stop fighting and to stop producing armies, weaponry, ships, etc. Mon Mothma then demilitarized the New Republic, leaving only like 10% of the army they had before, a much smaller force than the old Republic had in the Clone Wars. 
The capital world was moved from planet to planet across the galaxy so no systems felt like any one system was favored over the other. The Senate no longer held meetings on Coruscant. The Emperor had a contingency plan in the event of his death. A man named Gallius Rax was in charge of these plans. He basically orchestrated the end of the Empire, causing all the factions and admirals to fight each other until there was almost no navy left by the time of the Battle of Jakku. After Jakku, much of the Empire went off into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy (uncharted space) for some reason that's yet to be revealed, but it's hinted that it's something to do with the source of the dark side of the Force. It seems like this may be where Snoke is found. 
So decades later, the First Order emerges but the New Republic sees them as no threat. Most of the senators believe they will remain peaceful and are unaware of their massive army of stormtroopers they are forming. Leia sees the real threat they are and eventually forms the Resistance. In reality, at least some of the senators are corrupt and involved in the First Order. Many senators miss the stability of the Empire and wish it could still exist, just with a more benevolent Emperor and no super weapons. 
So there's this Cold War going on when the Force Awakens happens. 
Luke has been going around the galaxy learning all he can about the Force. He tried to form a new Jedi Order but his nephew Ben Solo betrays him and it's presumed he killed all the Jedi in training and burned the temple with the Knights of Ren. Then it seems Luke went into exile, feeling like he's failed the galaxy, and goes looking for the first Jedi temple to rethink the whole Jedi philosophy. 
Who knows what's happened with Rey. Maybe her parents are just random people who abandoned her on Jakku and the Force just chose her to play a part in things. 
Anyways, that's the basic backstory of TFA. And that was way longer than I meant it to be...&&Tell that to Kanjiklub&&Wow, I never knew that. Imagine how different the franchise would be. It makes me wonder if Ian McDiarmid would've even been Emperor Palpatine.&&If I drink a gallon of water in about 2 hours I will be peeing every 30 minutes for the rest of the day. It's a living hell. I also don't know why I told you this.&&Almost is bad is the one that you thought was a fart, but then it felt wet, so you waddled to the bathroom and wiped only to realize that you're clean and dry. Really makes you question your sanity.&&actually most people on here admit to sharting themselves.  There was a thread on a it a while back and finally someone said, ""you're telling me ALL of you have shit yourself at one point or another?""&&https://m.imgur.com/gallery/8tOcpZS&&Thought I had a problem til I realized I take in about a gallon and a half a day. I pee a lot. &&Since when is Mexico in Naboo?&&He gets shunned by society and spends his remaining days on Naboo as a street performer for children.

Seriously.&&Oscar buzz, gave the guy essentially the keys to the franchise, done by October. There is hype &&Your overconfidence is your weakness. &&Twice the achievement &&Jedi rocks?&&It’s not irrational.&&I'm honestly glad we have them. It's easy to get back into the movie, if it's good.

And I like having the option to pee or get something to eat.&&India too &&Don't ask, will smell.&&> creepy asexual nude paintings in Palpatine's office!

Could you show a screencap of these paintings? I have no idea what you're talking about.&&[I don't know if his neck is *looooong* enough to be the chosen one](https://youtu.be/WhcE9kZjOZo?t=21m33s)&&What is it with Ricks?&&You need a high midiclorian count to understand&&Iirc there's an edit that only includes Obi want scenes that turns the movie into an investigation thriller.&&Right? Without the romance it would have been a really cool detective caper&&The first time I saw Attack of the Clones (as a 9 year old) I absolutely loved it, but my friend was unimpressed and I didn't understand why. Turns out the romance brought the good parts of the movie down for him while the Obi Wan mystery and Geonosis hijinks absolved the mushy parts of the movie for me. To this day it's my favorite of the prequels, I just ignore the bad parts.&&One of my favorite scenes in the entire series is actually the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin chase Padme's attempted assassin through Coruscant. I liked that we kinda got to see a glimpse of people in the Star Wars universe living normal lives and doing normal things like dancing in clubs and eating at diners during Obi-Wan's investigation. It's a side of Star Wars that we don't normally get to see. Plus, the backgrounds felt very Blade Runner-ish, so that was cool too. &&What about the other two wishes? &&It's R. Kelly flavored soda.&&It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.&&It was all worth it for ""my friends, you bow to no one.""&&I always thought ROTJ wrapped up too quickly&&[deleted]&&Deathly Hallows had, like, an eight month-long intermission.&&It’s the longest of the HP films, which kinda surprised me. 161 minutes.&&It all depends on if the cinema wants to offer it or not.

Intermission:

Pros - Allows people to have a break to pee and to buy even more food at the concession stand.

Cons - Takes up valuable time that could be used to fit in another showing/trailers/ads. (That last one is more for the cinema, not the customer, because we all hate the ads).

Also the studios generally have to give the all clear to let them have one. But most do.&&How stupid are you people? Everyone buys popcorn. Everyone watches star wars in a dark theatre. By the time you have to pee your popcorn bag is empty. This is when you whip out your dick and fill the bag. You're welcome reddit.&&I used to see commercials for catheters all the time. Now I know why. &&I'll get the van and blindfold.&&The actual movie pauses for intermission&&This guy pees&&Yep. I was in the pit maybe 5 rows back from the stage during a Metallica concert. Surrounded by 20,000 people who all want to be closer to the stage. Right as the lights go down for the band to hit the stage, my bladder fills up. There's no way I can hold it the whole show and there's no way I'm leaving this spot. So I look around and see a bunch empty cups on the ground.. Pick one up.. Unzip... Release. Never felt so elated and embarrassed at the same time. Put it on the ground and the music started so everyone began to move. Oh well&&Any serious cinephile brings a catheter to the theater.  &&One toilet at the back of each cinema, with a TV showing a feed of the film. &&I shuddered, well done&&$300 million for a terrible movie. Watch how the flash runs. It’s like they explained in “running” in German Ice Sksting terms. His legs whip at their hips to run while he flails his arms. 

Mind. Fucking. Boggling. &&I know this is said a lot but it applies the most here, it looked like a video game.&&I could have forgiven all of BvS's sins if Luthor was actually a powerful, serious, sophisticated businessman with a big ego and massive ambitions. The ""Joker-lite"" performance was what categorically ruined the movie for me. &&I wouldn't go as far to say as it ruined the movie but it definitely knocked it down a notch or two.&&I'm not familiar with the DC universe, for me Steppenwolf is a rock band.

So yeah, they could have picked a better villain.&&Yeah 7 cups is 56 ounces. A very normal amount of water to drink, maybe even on the low end depending on who you ask.&&Dunno if you were being serious...just in case!

&&That one never needed to exist in the first place. Would have been so much easier and more effective to use a piece of fishing line instead of animating it. &&That's when the real fun begins...&&Would endless mayonnaise have an expiry date? If it replenishes it’s self, it should be fresh mayo, but if it’s endless with only one expiry date, you’re gonna have to eat mayo with just about every meal to get the best of it while it’s still good. &&It would not have flowed well.

When you transfer from one medium to another, you need to adapt to the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the medium.

Books can be long and detailed, and show exactly what characters are thinking, and have many largely seperate, detailed arcs with a vague overriding arc.

Movies are just about the opposite.  You can't see what anyone is thinking. And because of the pacing, you generally need to have a strong overarching arc that occurs over the course of smaller scenes or sequences that individually aren't as detailed or important.

The choices made for the Lord of the Rings movie were mostly good, including cutting out the Scouring of the Shire.  Instead of showing how the Hobbits had grown at the end of the movie, by them coming back and being contrasted with the rest of Hobbiton, their growth was shown continually throughout the movie, so that the climax of plot and story could occur close together, and not draw on too long.  The changes made gave us a *better* movie and a *better* story than had the book been used as a direct script.

&&I would've preferred seeing that ending by far. Going through all that shit with the ring only to come back to the Shire to see it getting taken over was one of my favorite parts of the book. I remember when I first watched the movie and Legolas kills Wormtongue in the first ten minutes, I was like ""Oh, I guess they're not doing the whole last part of the book.""&&In the Netflix version it just pauses on black for an extra 5 to 10 seconds, narrator still says it that way.&&Nothing Star Wars has done is as pointless as the Green Lantern movie though. They animated a mask onto Ryan Reynold's face instead of just y'know, giving him a mask.&&The real fun(gus)? &&and you force feed it to Reginald&&Not gonna lie, I'm glad this is hypothetical&&",2017-11-17 11:47:30

It's messed up.&&I don't understand how difficult it is to just NOT sexually assault someone....&&Never have heroes.&&And it always ends up being people I admire or appreciate their artistic endeavors. Why can't people just be normal?!? Why would someone with daughters that he seems to care very much about think it's okay to mistreat other women. Not that it's confirmed he did something yet but still...wtf. &&Praise Be! Or you could jack off in the mirror with a mask on and pretend someone is watching you..... Heard about it from a friend. 
Really though, I don't understand how fucking crazy this is. It's as if no one has been left unscathed in the Hollywood industry. It could happen anywhere but come on people. It ruins everything I've ever enjoyed by these famous individuals. Nothing compared to the people they are abusing but it just sucks to see how many people are this fucked up. &&I guess the place to hide is right under the nose. It worked for Gendry.&&""That is the worst penis I have ever seen""- Ricky Gervais&&Unquestionably a good thing. Abusers WILL continue their behaviors unless they're caught. So think about all the future victims it saves.&&I imagine part of the turn on is the entire atmosphere surrounding the 'event.'

Just like some people don't like that a prostitute didn't 'choose' to have sex with them so they don't use them.  Part of the allure of sex is mutual attraction for those people.&&Hello fellow tatertot.

But yeah I enjoy Louis C.K.'s comedy but I also wouldn't be surprised to hear if he was exposing himself to women based off his stand-up bits. &&What's the backstory here

Edit:[Found it](http://defamer.gawker.com/louis-c-k-will-call-you-up-to-talk-about-his-alleged-s-1687820755)&&Bingo. A lot happened since then. I’ve been pretty paranoid. But finally starting to talk about it again &&Me too jeans&&I know what you're sayin.  

I'd be monogamous too if I had those big mushy purples to come home to every night. &&Of course, you never really know. But Rogan, Burr and Segura don't really seem sexually hung up. Unfortunately, the news about Louie doesn't surprise as much as others. Louis clearly had some sexual hang ups in his art. &&Linseed oil then.

Step 4: Don't get kicked out of film!&&I want this but with Adam Sandler playing every character &&I mean, you're pretty much right. PR, legal advisers, attorney's etc. pretty much anyone that can provide a ""cushion"" when those claims finally hit.&&Anyone of any prominence in the entertainment industry has a ""team"".

They have acents, managers, publicists, lawyers. Not necessarily only working for them full time.

People decided they knew him based on what he said on a stage, in front of a camera, part of a performance.  It's like judging someone's life only by the pictures they upload to their Facebook.

One thing that I hope comes of all this is a change in the relationship between the public and celebrities; we have a tendency to not be able to separate people from their work and it's that aspect of celebrating a person rather than their accomplishment/work that has led to the rise of YouTube stars/prankers, reality show stars and people famous for being famous.  The bar has dropped and now just about anybody can walk over it.

It's hard to know anybody, even those closest to us.  So to assume we knew celebrities we've never met is a stretch.  To say 'well it makes sense about Weinstein but Cosby?  We heard about Spacey but Louis too??' doesn't make any sense to me.  Weinstein and Spacey were just as capable of compassion, sense and intelligent speech as Louis and Cosby, just like the latter were capable of monstrous behaviour (if the allegations are true).

I hope among the many careers and lives that will sink with the outcome of all this, one of the things to also crash is this idea of assuming we know people we've never met.&&""Fuck you, muffins!!"" &&Oh, boy...&&..........

It's a goddamned deviant behavior that they enjoy, and because they are wealthy and ""powerful"" they get to practice it without consequence.  Or so they believe.  Malignant narcissism, maybe.&&But plenty of people have power.

You may actually be right.

As long as it's consenting adults I generally don't give a damn... Generally. &&You're absolutely right and I'm just as much susceptible to it as the rest.  We have a habit of seeing musicians and stand up comedians this way because their work, by nature, usually comes from a singular, personal source and is meant to connect with us and that one-on-one connection is what creates this idea that there is a relationship there.  There isn't.  The relationship isn't between you and them, but rather you as an audience and them as a performance and that relationship ends when the performance is over and you cease to be an audience; but it's hard to separate that when you leave and we have a tendency to carry it with us.

It's something we as a society need to work on too and it's only something I started doing the last few years, whereas as a teenager and in my early twenties, I was in head/heels with celebrities as my heroes and following interviews and learning about their lives and their drama, etc.  But there comes a point when you realize that the only honest and valuable thing any artist, politician or public figure has to say is said in their work and the credibility of their work is what gives *them* power, not the other way around.  Everything else is just marketing, promotion, an act, a statement, a performance.

I don't mean to say all celebrities are cheating us.  I don't blame them.  It's not that different from social media; of course we all want to present our best face, picture, moments.  Very few people are going to upload their weakest moments, their indulging in temptations, their insecurities.  None of us want to be judged by our worst moments and that's just as true of them.  And they are just as much victims of it, where we all (feeling like we have a relationship with them) want to know about their private moments, follow their families and lives outside of their work, invading their privacy, making a market out of their daily lives.

My point is simply that *that* relationship doesn't exist, it's an illusion.  We don't know these people enough to dissect them, to have an understanding of them, to have a relationship of any level with them.  We only know their work, which we can dissect, appreciate, keep and carry.  Our relationship with a comedian is with his performance, with an author is in his writing, with a musician is with their music.  

As a civilization, we haven't figured this whole 'celebrity' thing out yet and there's a lot that still needs to be changed.  Chief among them is this problem that we *know* these people and have any sort of relationship with them.  It's entirely possible to appreciate someone's work and accomplishments while regarding them as a stranger...because that's what they are.&&Granny fuckin WATAH! &&Graig Jammings&&He broke his fuckin' leg...&&""Would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?""&&-Robert California

He actually IS a sad, pathetic loser.&&That's it. Times article just came up on my phone.&&I just read the article. Five women came out to say that he invited people (female comedians who were on his show and etc.) to his hotel room and he proceeded to whip out his cock, take off his clothes, and masturbate in front of them even though he asked them beforehand if he could do that and the girls ~~said no~~ ""thought it was a joke and laughed it off."" Another time, a girl said that she heard him masturbating while he was talking to her on the phone.

Kind of makes you wonder about all the times he talked about masturbation on his show and routine.

"Tommy Wiseau submitted ‘The Room’ to Paramount with the hope of getting it distributed. Usually it takes a studio roughly two weeks to reply, but the film was rejected within 24 hours.",45010,7famwv,http://www.oddfilms.com/blog/movie-recommendations/the-room-tommy-wiseaus-bizarre-masterpiece/,1490,1511560109.0,,"The imdb trivia for this film is the most hilarious read. Some gems include;

- Many of the crew members had to conceal their laughter about what they were witnessing. Even the cameraman began to laugh so hard the camera would shake during takes. The first DP even had his own tent where he would laugh out of sight, while ostensibly watching the footage.

- Although the rooftop scenes were shot with green screen, an actual rooftop was available but never used during filming.

- The reason why Peter seemed dazed and was touching things in one scene was because the actor had suffered a concussion and Tommy Wiseau wouldn't let him leave for treatment.

- Drew Caffrey, who is credited as an executive producer and casting agent, died in 1999, three years before production began.

- According to Tommy Wiseau, Denny has some sort of mental disorder, which explains his behaviour in the film. Philip Haldiman (the actor who portrays Denny) was not told about this.

- Entire scenes were out of focus because nobody bothered to check the lens.

- Post release Tommy Wiseau has claimed that this film was always meant to be a comedy full of so-bad-it's-good elements. The rest of the cast has cast doubt on this theory however.

- According to Juliette Danielle, when Tommy Wiseau said the line ""In a few minutes, bitch,"" everyone on the set began laughing at him. Wiseau came out of the bathroom and demanded to know what was so funny.

- The film's editor tried to convince Tommy Wiseau to cut the shot of his naked buttocks from the movie, on the grounds that the sight of them scared his wife.

- A billboard for the film was erected on Highland Avenue in Los Angeles, where it stayed for five years. Later, the same billboard was used to promote the book The Disaster Artist, written by co-star Greg Sestero about the film's making.

- Shot simultaneously on 35 mm film and high-definition video. Tommy Wiseau was confused about the differences between the formats, so he used both cameras on the same mount. He also purchased the cameras, instead of renting them as film productions usually do.

- According to Greg Sestero, Tommy Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, at the outset of production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. Wiseau eventually decided to drop the subplot after learning that there was no practical way to film the flying car scene on the production's budget.

- Unlike most movies, where the sets are generally closed while filming nude sequences, Tommy Wiseau insisted that the set be open while filming the long love scene between Lisa and Johnny.

EDIT: A few more.


- Somehow filming lasted 6 months.

- The film was originally written as a play, then a novel. 

- When Greg Sestero had to call Dan Janjigian to tell him that they were going to reshoot his scenes, Dan's response upon picking up the phone was ""Did Tommy blow up the studio yet?""

- Tommy Wiseau once yelled at a crew member for farting on set.
&&Well, Paramount lost on this one because this movie is going to keep paying out much longer than a lot of their own productions.&&He also paid to keep it in theatres for the 2 week minimum to qualify for the academy awards. The one theatre that premiered and showed it mind you. &&Should I watch The Room before watching The Disaster Artist?&&It's like the Always Sunny gang trying to get money for Lethal Weapon 6&&I love the theory that Tommy is actually one of Andy Kaufman's characters or at least some kind of post mortem stunt he set up. &&Ha ha ha. What a story Mark.&&Fun story:

A few years ago Tommy came to one of the screenings that the local theater in DC does of the movie. When we came into the theater down the escalator, he was waiting at the bottom with a table signing stuff. I got him to sign a butt plug I bought to have him sign. He didn't seem phased or question it. We gave him our copy of The Disaster Artist that Greg and Mike signed and he said ""throw this way it's all lies,"" we told him we were sorry and he said, ""I kid, I kid, but burn this"" and signed it. I was first in line for the Q and A and I said that my girlfriend and I built our relationship around the movie, because one of the first things we talked about was the book when we accidentally met online and I sent her my copy to read. I asked if he had advice. He rambled about numbers for a while that didn't make sense, then said ""anyway get married before you die old and alone like me."" I said we would get married if he officiated. He told her to come up and did a weird gesture and some mumbled ""in the name of the son, the spirit, and the holy ghost"" etc then told us we were married and his assistant who was in The Neighbors gave us merch.

A year or two later, he did an interview and said he was putting his effort into start a dating site for fans because ""he had heard people were meeting because of the movie."" His assistant added us on Facebook despite us never telling him who we were.&&My favorite story in the book The Disaster Artist is about the Golden Gate Park football toss between Mark and Johnny.

Apparently the playful tackle was anything but.

The dialogue during the scene is looped stuff like, ""How's it going man?"" - ""Good, you?"", like a lot of dialogue mixing in the movie. But what Greg Sestero actually said was 'catch this' in French. He writes in the book that Tommy immediately glared and yelled,""NO FRENCH WORDS IN MY MOVIE, DAMN IT!"" and tackled him for real.

I love this story. It's not only hilarious, but retroactively explains why no character in The Room ever says the word *fiancee*. Tommy Wiseau ~~was~~ is so determined to present himself as the All-American Hollywood Filmmaker that he won't even use a french word that Americans use every day in his script.&&YOU ARE TEARING ME APART PARAMOUNT &&If you think Tommy Wiseau's movies are bad, check out Neil Breen-- a deep cut is *Fateful Findings*. Either he's a comic genius in poor editing, or just the worst filmmaker the world has ever seen.&&He should've tried to have it distributed with Lionsgate.

Those weirdos will literally try to make money on ANYTHING!&&But the movie was so bEaUtIfuuuUUUGGGHHHL! &&I just saw some clips on YouTube and I'm not going to lie, it's hilariously bad. Worse than I thought possible. &&I knew nothing about The Room until the buzz started with The Disaster Artist. So, I watched it. Since then, I've watched several interviews with the ""actors"" that were in it and several have states they didn't know how bad it was until watching the final product during the premiere. How? I understand Wiseau. I'm not sure he gets it even still. He just knows he's making money from it now. But it isn't just the acting and the dialogue that's bad. The story is completely disjointed and all over the place. There are scenes that make utterly no sense whatsoever and don't fit into the the story at all. How could they not realize they were making a steaming pile of crap? &&Honestly, if I was an executive, I could confidently pass on The Room within the first 3 seconds&&I want to live in a world where Paramount actually picked this up for distribution.&&Makes perfect sense! Art films don't have much of a market anyway.&&Well it is called **THE** worst movie for a reason&&To be fair, it's a really bad movie.&&I highly recommend his series called The Neighbors.   It’s much much worse than The Room. 
 &&I used to work for Chris R, the drug dealer in the movie. He was part owner of some shitty restaurant downtown Austin. He was mostly a douche and always acted like He was better than everyone, he had his moments where he was cool but for the most part, a total douche.  He almost fired me on the first day of work for having a tiny hole in my pants. He yelled at the guy that hired me ""you hired a fucking guy that can't even afford fucking pants?!!"" and stormed off, right in front of me. It made me feel like shit I was 19 in college and barely had any money to eat that week. 3 years later my friend asks me if I want to see one of the worst made films in history. I see the rooftop scene and I get joyful sense of revenge. By thi,s time the resteraunt had gone under but I contact a few ex coworkers we all get stoned and drunk and have a watching party, it was a grand ol time. 6 years later I see a trailer for the disaster artist, I just laugh out loud in vengeful laugh...god im a piece of shit.&&I met Wiseau a couple years back. He wanted to make an addition to his house and was surprised at the level of bureaucracy he had to go through to do this (Southern California). But he was still polite about it. Normally ""celebrities"" don't go into city hall to work on projects, they get some middle man to do it. I guess he was saving money, or trying to see if people knew him? 

I had no idea who he was until he left, as my younger co-worker told me that he created the cult classic The Room. &&He looks like a centuries-old vampire.&&Yet it still came out.

I cannot think of a better example of perseverance paying off.&&Go watch this movie if you haven’t. Then get the disaster artist audiobook. Not the book, the audio book. It’s narrated by Greg and he does a great Tommy impression.&&[deleted]&&I saw the Franco brothers interviewed on this show we have in the UK called The One Show and they even painted this picture of a guy who is a complete enigma. James Franco said that Wiseau financed the movie himself with money he made selling jeans, but the thing that confused him is Wiseau's insistence that he was born and raised in America (i think Franco said New Orleans) when he has an Eastern European accent.

They confirmed that he had seen their movie 4 times and loved it and only objects to one scene where James Franco throws a ball, because Wiseau said he would throw it far better.

&&> According to Greg Sestero, Tommy Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, at the outset of production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. Wiseau eventually decided to drop the subplot after learning that there was no practical way to film the flying car scene on the production's budget.

This makes sense. When I was watching it I got the impression that it's like a play which is why the dialog is so absurd.&&If you go down Beach Street in San Francisco, Wisaeu still has a The Room billboard up on the building he owns (where they filmed the coffee shop scenes) where he used to have his Street Fashions business set up.&&That’s the magic of terrible cult movies.

I mean after i watched it the first time, i was so repulsed and never wanted to watch it again. And then i started to talk to people about it how bad it is and other agreed. And suddenly you sit there again and watch it with a bunch of friends and weirdly enough their builds this odd fascination, like watching a car crash where people hang out of the window and it's so terrible but at the same time you cant look away.

This is exactly the way my brain read your comment &&You should watch the whole thing, it's hilarious&&you should watch the whole thing, I spent my time trying to convince myself to turn it off while the devil in me told me to watch in amazement on how bad it gets every other scene. 

every moment is worse than you can actually imagine, even if you've seen the previous moments&&They don't film a move in order, and the actors don't even know which take is going to be used or how it's edited. So bad acting would be easy to spot for an actor, but until you see how its all pieced together it will always feel very disjointed.&&“I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer.”

Never mentioned again in the whole movie &&Most of the actors would only get the script for the scenes they were in. Greg Sestero says in the Disaster Artist book that the actor who played Chris-R asked if it was possible for him to be in more scenes, because he had no idea if his role how relevant his character would be. Turns out not very. &&As someone who did film at uni and occasionally make a film here and there, right up to the moment you see the rough edit you tend to genuinely think you’re making something amazing. Then reality hits...hard, then you realise you’re going to be showing it to an audience. It was a painful experience.

I wasn’t the only one and still bump into people now who think their idea is the best thing ever, usually met with 😐. Again, I still fall into this category every once in a while.

Ego and/or pride tends to cloud your judgement during the process.

That and everything is filmed out of order.&&I teach ap human geography and we are looking at pop culture.  I used this movie as an example of a strange way that culture can spread, and so they begged me to watch some scenes. We watched part of the roof scene and the flower shop scene and they loved it.  

Then a student asked me what the movie was about, what was the plot. I could not answer.

The problem is that he has some modicum of self awareness now that people are making fun of him so he's purposely trying to be funny...it's just not nearly as enjoyable as the room. That being said I fucking loved The Tommy Wi-Show. A lot of it was scripted and edited but there's so many entirely genuine candid moments when he actually is playing the game, it's like taking a peak into his mind.&&But he was the best actor in the movie! Sad to hear he was such an ass, out of curiosity what restaurant was it? &&But did you have his fucking money?&&Because he is. He sleeps during the day and wakes during the night.

It is pretty useless unless you write and have trouble with these types of characters, so it is completely skipable, however feedback is welcome if so missed something or got it wrong.*

It does kinda make sense in a twisted way. If an actor is playing a mental ill person they tend to over act and go for the sterotypical stuff, like swearing for touretts ticks or germaphobia and orderliness for OCD. There have been outliers like DiCaprio, Bale, or Sir Hopkins who gave very good and convincing preformances, however most just feel forced. What made those preformances were the little things that wouldn't make sense if you weren't aware of the character's disability. 

To have someone not know or understand their characters disorder is the best way to simulate an actual disorder. When someone with a disorder does something, they usually aren't a willing participant in it but just along for the ride. These acts are called compulsions, and sometimes people will feel overwhelming compulsions and act on them, no matter how benign or silly the act is. This could be something as pointless as touching something a certain amount of times (sometimes with no basis for number, sometimes with, depends on the person), all the way to something dangerous like hitting oneself or scratching a certain spot till blood is drawn.

To the people around the sufferer, and depending on the scope of the disability the sufferer too, these compulsions almost always seem pointless. They can be inconvenient or they can happen with a certain flow that makes you think quirky instead of disabled. If the actor for the character and the actors around the character are unaware of why the character is doing something it will produce more genuine expressions and feelings.

An important little trait that people often forget when playing a character with OCD are confusion or seeming dazed. When something is running through your head with OCD it takes priority on brain train track one. Everything else is just background noise. Sure you might be able to tune in to the noise and catch bits for a while, but it will all eventually roll back to the roaring thunder of the train. When someone forcefully breaks through that noise and commandeers the tracks for a bit that will usually cause the sufferer to seemingly snap out of a daze or be look extremely lost as to what was happening.

For things like sociopathy people often attribute it to characters that have a god complex or people that just carry a general disdain for others, which is a critical mistake. The most important part of making a sociopathic character is that they must remain neutral towards others. Yes they can have momentary flare ups of emotion or even feel strongly about a single person or group of people, but on a whole they maintain an indifference and ignore everyone else as they simply don't find them interesting enough to care about. This means that they do not intentionally kill or save people unless it would be of direct benefit to them. This is a hard character to portray as we always have our emotions, so to portray not having those is something that feels inherently unnatural. I feel that the Joker is a perfect example of a sociopathic mindset, he doesn't care about any person not directly related to Batman in some way. To him Batman is the only person worthy of his undivided attention, everyone else are just pawns on the great chessboard he sits at.

Psychopathy and Sociopathy have been lumped into one disorder called ASPD, but for the sake of characters and writing they can be considered different. Psychopaths are going to be the more violent sociopaths, like Bale in American Psycho. These people not only disregard humans but also carry a disdain for them, seeing other people as inferior and disposable.&&My girlfriend and I were watching The Neighbors and knew that James and Seth were playing Greg and Sandy in the adaptation of Sestero's book, and when Zach Efron freaks out and is super angry we thought ""dude, he should be in Disaster Artist,"" my girlfriend said Chris R and we laughed for a solid five minutes. He is playing Chris R.&&I love that Chris R had the ""R"" in his name even though there aren't two Chris's in the movie. I think Tommy was questioned on why he's called that and said it was because he's a drug dealer.&&He's also an Olympic level athlete and a motivational speaker. &&Greg Sestero praised that actor as the best in the film.&&It explains everything about him: the strange Eastern European accent he won't admit to, why he won't say how old he is or where he actually comes from, how he got his money, his bizarre social skills.

But there are things that give you pause from them. Like anything under their [Grindstone] (http://www.imdb.com/company/co0209560/) label.&&It's not even scene to scene, though. The scene where Denny tells Johnny that Lisa is hot and he wants to kiss her. And Johnny completely dismissed it like it's something your mentee would tell you everyday. What? It didn't fit into the movie at all. No one there watched and said ""what the hell is this? Why would you film this scene?""

Edit: and what about Lisa's mother's breast cancer. It's kind of brought up that she's dying and then never mentioned again. &&And I guess that since most of the people involved were inexperienced and not all that talented themselves they didn't exactly know what they were doing. &&Well, Lisa tells her to focus on getting better. So ... I guess it worked.&&Yet another scene that made no sense and had no bearing on the movie whatsoever.

So it wasn’t a matter of “hey I’m gonna make a shitty movie, I hope it goes viral” or even worse a “we are intentionally making bad movies” thing like the godawful and soulless Sharknado series. 


One redditor summed it up really well: 

Imagine a shirt clip where a guy shits his pants.

The Room is hidden camera footage of a guy going “oh man, I hope I make it to be bathroom in time...   oh no!”

Sharknado, Birdemic, et al are more along the lines “hey guys, watch this, I’m gonna shit my pants!”&&It's a perfect parody of a friends-drama movie.  Like Naked Gun for cop shows, except they had no intention of parodying the genre.&&The Pollack of film making. &&I wish I could remember where I first heard this, but apparently ""trash"" art and ""avant garde"" art both scratch the same psychological itch of defying/ignoring conventions. I think a good artist has an intention with their work, where the end goal reflects that intention to some degree. Wiseau and _The Room_ don't really qualify for me in that respect, but there's something magnetic about how terrible it is. &&A gem from the wikipedia article:
>It is like a movie made by an alien who has never seen a movie, but has had movies thoroughly explained to him.&&Birdemic 2 suffered from the same problem.  The director producer knew that people were expecting something bad so he didn’t try to make it anything but.  &&It was called Roux, it's now the Bikinis restaurant &&But yes, Dan might be a Dick but he was  the best damn actor in the film.

He's Eastern European, but he illegally migrated to France. He learned French, got a fake passport, and came to America and learned English in New Orleans. So, it's a clusterfuck of three of the weirdest accents to combine. The popular theory is Polish, so imagine a Polish French Cajun accent. Oh and add possible brain damage into all of that. &&The royalties should keep him afloat now. &&Misplaced confidence is kinda Tommys thing. &&I read it was the sex scene that was filmed first (Lisa’s AMA). &&I refuse to believe he's not DB Cooper.&&I go the other way. He’s a recently resurrected vampire and I have evidence. 

1. His speech cannot be matched to any modern accent and his acting is the way it is because his grasp of modern language is just not there yet.

2. His appearance can lead to the reasonable inference that he is a creature of the night.

3. He attempted to come out with his movie but he was stopped when he realized that people were not ready he made an odd excuse.

4. Though he had a rooftop on which to shoot scenes he elected to use a green screen because he couldn’t expose himself to direct sunlight.

5. His mysterious wealth consists of the fortunes his lordship back in medieval Europe yielded.

You can look at the countless sharknado type movies as an example. They try to cash in in the so bad its good model but they are just to self aware for it to work.

It's also because they're not trying to be good. Tommy Wiseau made *The Room* as like his magnum opus, his personal gift to the audience and cinema. Whatever one may think of it, he did want it to be a great film. His aspirations were much higher than his capabilities in script-writing, acting and directing.&&>And that model is so hard to emulate.

because it was an accident... Tommy wiseau is a man with some sort of mental disability... just based on the way he lies about his life, his age, really anything. 

the kind of crazy person who would dub in their lines... but not anyone elses therefore transcending the genre of films that are just bad dubs and leading to an awkward movie with 1 character's sound who doesn't match his voice. 

the whole thing really is a masterpiece. but more so because of what an insane look into this dude's head it is. &&Wait, so let me get this straight... it's ironic then, that movies that people ironically like have to be sincerely made in order to make them ironically bad, while movies that are ironically made in the hopes of people ironically liking them are actually too sincere for people to like them?&&I think the only movie I’ve ever seen that actually nailed that formula is kung pow: enter the fist.  &&This is why Snakes on a Plane sucked.. it had too much wink-wink nod-nod going on.

Your whole story was absolutely what-the-fuck-ish, awkwardly hilarious, and gripping. I recently learned about The Room and Tommy Wiseau, and every story and movie fact I learn is just so fantastically bizarre.

Thank you for sharing, and congrats on your.. umm, ""wedding ceremony?"" Lmao. That's an awesome memory to share with your girlfriend!

Edit: I think it's even funnier to me, because I'm picturing Tommy Wiseau sensually/awkwardly thrusting it into some poor lady's belly button repeatedly, talking dirty in that weird, alien-like broken English of his..&&Like a real human breen.&&The only two movies I saw from my brief scroll through that I've actually watched are Urge (which is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory) and Z for Zachariah (which was fine).

It's kind of brought up that she's dying and then never mentioned again.

The actress playing the mum probably just assumed that Tommy dropped that plotline and so wouldn't use the scene in the final edit. &&Well the disaster artist book kind of addresses that, basically people knew things were weird and some didn't make sense but because of reshoots and the disjointed filming it was hard to really know how bad it actually was until they saw it. They knew it would be bad, but it was hard to imagine someone would actually release something that bad. IIRC the whole production crew quit halfway through and Tommy had to find new people.&&Really the actors have no idea what parts of what they're shooting will actually make it into a final film. Whole scenes can end up on the cutting-room floor. Re-shoots might happen only for someone to decide that those re-shoots were pointless and further re-shoots are required to carry out the new plan.

It's really not uncommon for small details or minor lines to be in a movie that really only make sense once you've seen the deleted scenes. They just stand out more in The Room because the entire movie is so disjointed.&&Never seen it. I popped into this thread to figure out what the room actually is. I thought it was talking about 4 rooms at first, but that didn't make sense when people started talking about how terrible it is.&&You never know. I'm sure filming a Wes Anderson movie is bizarre and eccentric but the final product comes together really well. &&Chris-R is the only actually coherent and competent performance in the film..

Its like he walked in from a different, well made, movie&&In The Disaster Artist movie (very minor spoilers maybe?) Chris-R's big scene is the first one they shoot and everyone obviously thinks they're really onto something great because the acting is on point.

There is a review somewhere that said *The Room* is the cinematic version  of outsider art. I think that summed it up nicely. 

Edit : Found the review. It is a great  read if anyone is interested:



* https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/should-gloriously-terrible-movies-like-em-the-room-em-be-considered-outsider-art/280393/

> The 2003 film The Room was a failure by nearly every conventional measure of filmmaking. It took more than four months to shoot and reportedly cost six million dollars to make, but by the end of the film’s initial run it had earned all of $1,800 in box-office sales and had played in a single Los Angeles-area theater for two weeks. Among its many (many) cinematic sins, multiple plot threads stubbornly refuse to resolve themselves, characters converse like mysterious non-native English speakers, and soft-core sex scenes go on ... and on. Speaking for nearly every review of the film, one commentator quoted in a 2008 [*Entertainment Weekly* article ](http://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/)called it “The Citizen Kane of bad movies.”

&&This is the same reason troll 2 is so enjoyable as a “bad” movie. When the cast and crew try really hard to make the best movie they can, you can sense it in the product. They commit to the film and it works on an odd level. &&>his capabilities in script-writing, acting and directing


...And just being human.&&Tommy Wiseau is a ""man""...... I'm still not sure that this dude is human.&&Tommy’s movie wasn’t an accident, it was as expected as a next day.&&Yeah that's pretty much correct. People are weird. The best way to think of it is the difference between us all laughing at someone for accidentally falling down and not laughing at someone who is trying really hard to look like they are accidentally falling down.&&I'm bleeding! Making me the victor.

Such a great film&&Black Dynamite&&The thing about Snakes on a Plane is that it originally was trying to be serious. It's only after the Internet found out about it and made ""I've had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane"" a meme. They did some reshoots, made the film rated R, and added that line and others into the movie. So you have these self aware scenes that are in on the joke, tacked on to a film that was trying to play its silly conceit straight. The tone was somewhat inconsistent and didn't quite work. With that said, I think if they had played it straight the whole time it would have been sort of amusing but forgettable. &&Not only is their backstory, said backstory [has been made into another movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMKX2tE5Luk).&&It's a book written by Greg Sestero (Mark) called the disaster artist. It goes over his initial meeting with Tommy until the premier of The Room. In December they're releasing a movie based off of Greg's book.&&The Ringer had a great [article](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/11/21/16682914/the-disaster-artist-the-room-tommy-wiseau-greg-sestero-james-franco-tom-bissell) that touched on the films creation, it's rise in popularity, and the new movie being made about the film (The Disaster Artist).&&If you have /any/ interest in The Room or Tommy whatsoever, you absolutely need to read this book. I cannot stress that enough. It puts everything in a totally different light, watching The Room prior to reading The Disaster Artist and afterwards are totally different experiences.


The movie is not out yet so I can't judge the accuracy, but it's inevitable that some changes will be made for brevity or for a more dramatic or comedic affect. I highly recommend reading it first even if you do see the movie so that you can have the facts first. It's honestly such an amazing read. There's also an audiobook and Greg Sestero does a spot on impression of Tommy Wiseau.&&Bro the movie about the backstory is coming out in like next week, it's all over this sub.&&I've been to a showing in Ottawa that Tommy and Greg were there for.

He owned a number of residential and commercial properties around town including a building by fisherman wharf where a giant poster of the room hangs over it.

Still he must have sold some of them to finance the movie.&&The building in which the rooftop set was in had a rooftop.&&I got the results of the test back..

There are some...doozies on that list.&&I was at Indiana University when Wisseau and the actor that played Mark were taking it on tour. This was after the Tim and Eric episode. 

Anyway we were the first stop of his university tour. They had no idea. 

Our entire theater did call and response like it was rocky horror. It was constant mocking and laughter like any horrible film deserves. 

But Mark. Sweet Mark. Reality crashed home during the screening. I sat near the front on the left...so he was close. He went from nervous confident to oh shit in the first five minutes of the screening. By ten minutes he was in shock, and ultimately depressed surrender took over his face. I had never seen a man break before. 

And Wisseau couldn't see past the fame. It didn't register that his film was championed for being bad..he just saw people enjoyed his presence, and that miss amplified the audience enthusiasm. It was incredible and brutal. 

He did some photos with my friends Wisseau said to them ""I'm moving peoples bodies around now, it's my new thing.""

Except that's kind of what a director does. 

IDK man. I think the motorcycle story is the most true one. He's suffering from some brain damage. &&Correction, the whole production crew quit twice, IIRC. There was the first time, and then the people who replaced them also quit towards the end of filming (where they only had to shoot the flower shop scene, the ""How's your sex life?"" scene (that Tommy added in entirely so he could cheer Greg up due to him breaking up with his girlfriend) and some of the shots of LA), where it was just Tommy, Greg and a couple of other guys.&&Even with big budget popular movies, there are many times when an actor will show up to premiere and discover their entire scene has been cut out and they aren’t in the film at all anymore. &&[here is 7 seconds from the movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vRysBZk6iQ) Do yourself a favour and watch it, especially if you are a big fan of the craft of film-making. Because The Room is a prime example of how *not* to make a film, because absolutely nothing - not even the most basic things - make sense, and it is completely hilarious as a result.&&If you want to watch something so ridicously bad that it's funny, watch it. If that's not your bag, steer away from it. Watch a few clips on YouTube and you'll get a sense of what you're getting into &&It’s a bad movie that’s made fun when you watch it with other people to laugh at its ridiculousness, especially if they have watched it before. It’s enjoyable in a rocky horror kinda way minus the singing. The Mystery Science 3000 guys do a good cover of it and it’s way funnier with commentary. &&That's always a weird scene to watch. I can never tell if he seems good because he's in The Room, or if he's actually a decent actor who lucked out and got some of the non-terrible lines in the movie that all happened to be back to back.&&Interesting. I'll definitely be checking out the Disaster Artist when I get the chance &&People who think Darth maul should have been the central villain in the prequels. Why?

Guys, I think I'm gonna go make a movie.&&Tim and Eric did it.&&Exactly. The movie wasn't supposed to be ""ironic"" at the time -- Wiseau himself only attached that word to it after he saw audiences laughing at the movie.

It's actually kinda sad, because he clearly doesn't understand why people were laughing in the first place (and from what I've heard, Disaster Artist does a good job of portraying his response to everything, to a point where you kinda feel bad for him, cuz he clearly misinterprets the laughter, for the most part -- on some level, he understands it, but refuses to believe that people are laughing *at* him in the first place).

So he started claiming that the movie was a dark comedy, while still misunderstanding why it made people laugh.  He clearly has some sort of disability, IMO, but the funniness of the movie kinda outweighs that aspect. Plus, Greg Sestero made it clear that the guy was kinda a dick throughout the shooting -- so even if the guy has a screw loose, you can still find it funny cuz the guy was also an asshole to everyone on set.&&I want to see someone write/direct a movie who is TERRIBLE (like Tommy) but with a massive budget, like blockbuster movie budget. Maybe an epic movie like lord of the rings. &&My favorite description of The Room:

>It's like someone who had *heard* of the concept of people interacting decided to make a movie entirely about people interacting&&I've heard it as he's a bunch of geckos that got together in a skin suit and are trying to appear human.&&is that why it cost 6 million dollars, filmed in both 35mm and HD on cameras that were purchased not rented and took years to make with a bunch of re shoots and overdubbing audio? cmon. a rich autistic dude wanted to make a movie and did. &&I dunno, that's funny either way as long as someone gets hurt.&&I read the book adaptation of the movie and I thought it was good. Not great, but good.&&Seeing SoaP opening night in a packed theater with everyone in on the joke was probably the most fun movie viewing experience I've ever had. The energy in that theater was amazing. And following the movie progress online with the creators actually listening to internet community was extremely novel at the time.

However, with all that said, I haven't watched the movie since then and frankly I have to desire to either. It was just too unique of an experience with legit hype that I know can't be recreated. &&Wow. Franco nails the role of Wiseau&&In which the movie itself was remade.&&Thanks! I'm always looking for a new source of original articles for topics relevant to my interests.&&He started off selling trinkets on the dock, and used that money to buy Street Fashions, which I believe is a company that buys jeans with defects in them and sells them worldwide. He used the money from that to also fund some investments into real estate, including a large high-end apartment complex in San Francisco.&&It's very possible. However, at least one of his properties was a high-end apartment building that could very well have financed a good portion of the movie alone. We don't really know enough about his background or financial situation to say. It's a big part of the mystery surrounding Wiseau and the creation of *The Room.*&&The thing is that owning multiple properties requires you to start with lots of money. That's the thing about being wealthy, you need to be wealthy first.&&Don't worry about it.&&Leave your stupid comments in your pocket &&Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!&&I didn't recognize you with those glasses&&I saw a room screening in Boston in 2010. Greg seemed down to earth and accepting of the cult status of the film, but Tommy acted like a predator toward my female friends.

No one else in the cast had that advantage and suffered for it.&&He's not an actor. IIRC he was someone's old roommate and they brought him in because he had the right physicality.

And he actually came to set twice. There was an earlier version of the scene that took place in the alley instead of the rooftop.&&It's a great film. Walks the line between being hard on its characters when they're doing some pretty nasty things but also recognising the kind of beauty in chasing your dreams even when they're so far out of reach. Never felt overly mean-spirited and it was very very funny.&&I think it's because he was the first villain and looks really cool. Maul, Dooku and Grevious really all could've worked as the main villain IMO, although Dooku is definitely the best pick since he's the most interesting. Maul is also fleshed out in The Clone Wars and Rebels cartoons and has a pretty tragic story, so that might be influencing people's decision too.&&I've always thought the opposite. Have Dooku be the main villain of the trilogy instead of just part 2 and 3.&&We used to mix hen with bacardi dark&&yeah holy hell he looks old. &&[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1400/)&&I had never heard of this guy until tonight, but I believe this is true. &&Him owning a clothing store makes so much sense.

Sadly After Earth has a good director so it kind of falls into the blandness of being competently shot and directed but the horrible vanity script and Jaden Smith being Jaden Smith save it.

Battlefield Earth on the other hand is the full package: all-round top talent cast fully wasted, terrible script and the photography is the stuff of bad movie legend (Dutch angles EVERYWHERE!). All for a $73 million budget back then!

That said I'm all for an even more epic product of someones misguided ego to be made. I want a Marvel-superhero-movie-sized ""The Room"". Not some bland studio flop, no.

A movie featuring naked little girls with ambiguous genitalia might be a hard sell in the current Hollywood climate — even for Tommy.&&He was actually a good entrepreneur. Not so much a filmmaker&&This is still one of the biggest mysteries to me. Greg claims that he doesn't think Tommy is...I don't remember the exact phrase he used but like, competent enough to be running some kind of elaborate criminal scheme. 


That being said there's no way he earned millions from Street Fashions USA and importing leather jackets from Korea like he claims. Heck even that sounds like it may not have been entirely legal. The whole thing is pretty sketchy.


And being a Polish immigrant who had to work under slave like conditions in France and live with a relative in New Orleans definitely does not make it plausible that he just comes from money. 


To me the most likely explanation is that some of his money (though certainly not all) came from some kind of shady business practices. There's also speculation that Chloe Lietzke might've been some kind of sugar momma. And then he probably blew away most of his money on The Room and wasn't concerned cuz it was his dream movie and he thought it would be a big hit and earn him a lot of money in return. So he's most likely still not as rich as we think. But still, not everything adds up even then. Like, 6 million dollars is a ridiculously high amount of money for these circumstances. And after the film was released he spent 5 thousand dollars a month to keep that billboard up for 5 entire years.

He sold blue jeans that were bought  dirt-cheap through nefarious channels on the San Francisco waterfront for many years. This is pre-Internet. 


 He's the type of guy that has an idea, and just goes for it. If he had picked the wrong ideas, it would've led to financial ruin. But he is an entrepreneur, a true entrepreneur, who just tries his hand at whatever until something works.  

He's not self-aware enough to overthink it, so as with something like beginners' luck it always seemed to work.  He parlayed the jeans into several small stores in the area back in the early 90s and was very successful at it. &&he bought some properties in SF before the property bubble...

The press should be able to freely report and critique w/o fear of a childish screenings ban.&&Good. Having the critics' groups join together was a genius move, since not every editor would have been ok with their critic boycotting the advance screenings.

The old adage, ""Never quarrel with a man who buys ink by the barrel"" still applies, even if the ink is mostly digital these days &&Now for everyone to forget about it and love Disney again&&the takeaway that disney executives will have from this is that they need to buy the LA times.
 
In a world where the same corporations own the studios that make the movies,  the networks which show promos and ads for the movies,  review sites like rottentomatoes,  the companies that sell tickets online, the ISP which controls and soon moderates the internet that people use for nearly everything in-between,   conflicts like this are going to go away fairly soon,   but not in the way we'd like.&&It's always nice to see that people can hold some of the biggest companies in the world accountable through action.

Because if these critics hadn’t all banded together, this paper would have been bullied by Disney, one of the largest entertainment machines in the country.

Disney doesn't give a shit about public backlash. There's still billions of people who will go see whatever the next Disney/Marvel/Etc. film because they like them.

Don't get me wrong-- I like Disney movies but they don't typically gun for these particular kinds of awards.&&They weren’t disqualified from awards season.

They are still a shady corporation who strong arms theater chains, tries to trademarks phrase that represent a centuries long sacred tradition turned into a national holiday(for decades) for merchandising, influence local elections for personal gains like in Anaheim and don't even get me started on their shady dealing on past 30 years copyrights laws which basically destroyed public libraries forever and continue to do so in the future. People should be vigilant and hopefully won't just forget about it.

“Sir! The LA Times has published pieces that make us look like money-sucking parasites!”

“Replace them, Johnson.”&&> This is just worded to make it seems like the previous leadership was incompetent, and their replacement caused by their poor handling of the investigation piece against Disney

Yeah, that's the read I get from their statement too, and it seems pretty fucking disingenuous.

The[ LA Times' editor-in-chief was replaced on 2017-08-21](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/la-times-shakeup-top-editor-pushed-ross-levinsohn-named-ceo-1031365), and the bylines on [Part 1](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disney-anaheim-deals/) and [Part 2](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disney-anaheim-city-council/) of the articles about Disney are 08-24 and 08-26, respectively.

There was apparently a lot of internal dissatisfaction with that editor-in-chief (Davan Maharaj), which seems to have stemmed from him [sitting on a big investigative piece that showed corporate culpability in the OxyContin/opioid abuse epidemic.](http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/whats-matter-los-angeles-times/)&&That statement really flares my Crohn's.

&&the funniest part was seeing idiot shills like John Campea side with Disney because they cannot say a bad thing about the company that makes their precious Star Wars/Marvel movies&&[deleted]&&>Kudos to the journalists that stood in solidarity, and to Alyssa Rosenberg for starting the offense.

Thank you.  And thanks for giving Alyssa the credit she deserves.  Professional critics are a weirdly small-but-recognized community.  It's actually kind of enthralling how quickly we came together to stand by Justin and the Times.  

It's not just about movies, and it's not just about him... it's really about resisting attempts to manufacture consent and poison the square of public opinion.&&The Times really had the best and most succinct take on it.

> “A powerful company punishing a news organization for a story they do not like is meant to have a chilling effect. This is a dangerous precedent and not at all in the public interest,”&&Agreed this is a good win for journalism. Against the great house of mouse. &&Good on them for not being afraid to stand up to Disney.&&Does Disney really even care that much about Oscars though? People will go to see new Disney movies regardless of whether the last few were Oscar contenders, and Disney is solely concerned with money. &&Over this story: [Is Disney paying its share in Anaheim? The money battle outside the Happiest Place on Earth](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disney-anaheim-deals/)&&They were upset with reporting the LA Times was doing on their business dealings with the city of Anaheim. &&basically they've been bribing Anaheim city councilors since the 1950s and manipulating local elections to make sure the politicians in power would keep voting to do insane things in their favor (for instance the city built a parking structure that brings in an estimated 250-500 million dollars a year, for which Disney corp pays 1 dollar a year rent, yes you read that right 1 dollar). This came to a head recently when an outsider candidate ousted a Disney backed incumbent and the city has started cracking down and refusing to cooperate with Disney development plans.

The LA times reported on this and Disney tried to throw it's weight around by blacklisting them from attending pre-screenings of disney films. Critics accross the US responded by threatening to nuke Disney's chances at major awards by blacklisting them from the earlier critics awards that generally inform nominations to bigger shows like the Oscars.&&I know people have been saying this, but this really is the Streissand effect in action. I grew up in Orange County (the California one, not Florida) I still live close to the OC, I have friends and family in Anaheim, I go to Disneyland all the time, and I never would have heard about this if it wasn't for the backlash.&&To be real, this kind of stuff happens all the time in the business world and politics so they probably thought it would work here too.

Look for example at Apple banning gizmodo from any future events because they leaked the iPhone. They aren't by law required to let anyone that wants to be there in. The press is free to do what they like, but if a company or person doesn't like you they don't have to allow you to attend anything, in our current example an advanced movie screening.

Say for example a politician goes on a show and gets grilled. Next time they don't accept invitations to show up on that show. I like Obama a lot, but he did the same thing to Jake Tapper when Tapper really grilled them. Even before that, during the Bush years journalists weren't invited on military interviews on site if they were overtly critical of the Iraq war.

Honestly what Disney did was wrong but it's not as unusual as Reddit is making it out to be. This kind of stuff happens all the time. I'm glad the other news agencies stood up against it in this case but Disney and other companies will for sure do it again in the future.&&Their endgame was likely that either the L.A. Times came crawling back(likely memory holing the articles and/or firing the people responsible for them as a peace offering) begging to be let back into the press screenings, or that the L.A. Times would be left unable to cover Disney movies the way their peers could and languish as an example to others, forever regretting having gone against Disney. Not the worst plan, it's wouldn't be the first time a company has had a falling out with a media outlet like that. 

However they probably didn't expect that the L.A. Times would directly call them out on it, or that people would take such exception to the naked retaliation on Disney's part that'd they'd start to take a genuine stand against Disney. That kind of blow back is uncommon. Normally most places would be too afraid of permanently burning bridges with Disney to call them out. Few other outlets would have the guts to report on it, people would be outraged, but no one would do anything meaningful before they moved on to the next thing to be outraged about. &&Don't let the fact that disney tried to strong arm critics distract you from the new disney pixar movie, coco, coming out on November 22 ~~25~~ to a local theater near you!  &&If they acquire 21st Century Fox then they'll be able to strong-arm even harder next time, but more importantly X-Men will be under Marvel again! &&Just because there’s dicks at the top of Disney doesn’t mean there aren’t thousands of great artists and writers theyve employed over the past century who bring uplifting/positive stories to the world.

They've already got smaller theaters telling them to eat shit about that contract with the Last Jedi ( [Link] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/11/02/star-wars-the-last-jedi-why-disney-is-pressuring-u-s-theaters/#15ca356d604c) ) and this whole thing with the L.A. times. People are beginning to be become a bit too aware of Disney acting like fucking scumbags corporately to ignore them. The worry then becomes if they get exposed too much in the public light for being this way, the damage to their image might take years to remove (or in some cases forget).&&People will still see Disney movies regardless, and the company will rake in money.

But how that COULD'VE hurt Disney is that it could've dampened the company's ability to attract certain directors, producers, and other filmmakers – people who, on a personal level, really care about getting awards. And those film association awards make a huge difference in who gets nominated for the big things like the Oscars.&&Not sure about all the others but hey've won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature the last 5 years:  Zootopia, Inside Out, Big Hero 6, Frozen, Brave&&>I like Disney movies but they don't typically gun for these particular kinds of awards.

I have a closet full of FYC screeners that says otherwise.&&Possibly, but also this was snowballing. More and more news organizations were joining... DIsney creators were speaking out against them.

Who knows whether it ever would have gotten to the higher level awards shows, but it was getting worse and worse for them.&&> I think the public backlash is more costly than a few awards given Disney’s reputation as a family entertainment. 

Exactly. Disney's brand is its most valuable possession. They want the public to think of magic, family fun, and happy children when they hear the Disney name. Not vengeance and unscrupulous business practices. &&We're all connected.  Awards season has a number of precursors that influence nominations, beginning with Cannes and the other festivals, then the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics all the way to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (Golden Globes)... Granted, the Academy can do what they want as a guild but their members don't live in a vacuum, nor do audiences, nor does iTunes, Amazon, Hulu, and other sales channels that see bumps in rentals/sales on films that get announced in each one of these precursors in each of these large markets.&&I think it was the awards. If they want to hire good staff to make their movies, it will be difficult to do so if they can't even have the possibility of being recognized for it.&&That's mostly true but Critics awards can often be precursors for the larger awards like the Oscars. Getting enough of those critics to support you with an award really can make all the difference in getting a major award nomination. &&[deleted]&&Exactly, it's also puzzling to think of the ways in which this could have ended positively for Disney. They saw this was  going to be a thing, and the honest statement would have looked more like -

They have so much land they have to take care of themselves in Florida. In CA, they are smack dab in the middle of Anaheim, an otherwise functional city in the densely populated greater LA area. The major difference is there was no existing system to abuse in Florida, so they were left to actually take care of themselves instead of bilking the community out of its resources. &&> Anaheim and the Osceola/Orange county

What liberties were at risk here? 

Disney blacklisted some critics from seeing a film EARLY, not from seeing it at all. They didn't like what the Times said, and Disney took away their special privledges, not their goddamn rights.

Now, if the Times didn't care about those special privledges, it wouldn't have mattered. They do, so they got other organizations to boycott Disney, taking away some of THEIR special privledges in retaliation. 

I'm not arguing that Disney made the right move here, it's clear they didn't. But don't try to act like your freedom was being attacked or your rights are being stripped from us by the rich.

The first amendment doesn't prevent you from retaliation for the things you say or the things you print, UNLESS THAT RETALIATION IS FROM THE GOVERNMENT. &&As long as they keep pumping out Star Wars and comic book movies, no one really cares. Who knew that was all it took to get people to happily hand over agency to a corporation? The revolution will be merchandised.&&Hmm. I see your perspective. Fair point.

Thanks for taking time to explain rather than just downvoting and moving on. &&Most movie productions hold advance screenings of the movie to movie critics to review under the agreement that their reviews can't come out until x day, usually release day or a few days prior.

This allows movie critics to write reviews and have them ready by release day without having to rush it out and in turn allows the movie production to control the flow of hype and launch with reviews (hopefully) praising the production on opening day.

This exists for everything, even computer hardware releases (like cpus, motherboards,etc) do early releases to reviewers attached with embargos on when the reviews can go live. (the embargo is designed to avoid a race to release so that all parties can have time to a proper review)

What Disney did was ban any movie critic writing for the LA times from attending any pre-screenings of any disney produced movie.&&I agree, but the underlying point still stands. The press is free to operate how they would like and individuals can restrict that on a personal/business level as much as they like as long as it is only within the bounds of their property. 

Obviously we don't like it whenever we see it, but that's how it's always been. It's the trickiest part of being a ""hard hitting"" journalist and why they've constantly got to pick their battles.

To Trump's credit weirdly enough even though he keeps publicly shunning CNN, he's still maintained their White House press pass while he has no obligation to do so.

P1 is obviously true, but that has nothing to do with outright retaliatory practices over negative news. Just because nobody has a right to get a screening, doesn't mean there should be no repercussion for open and outright retaliatory practices. (Not to mention the tone of the ""I don't get invited to everything"" part **shudder* )

P2 Is basically changing the goalpost. The accusation is that selective banning as retaliation over a publication doing their job is economic interference. Whether other movies fundamentally don't do press screenings at all is completely irrelevant.

P3 is the same. selective fiscal punishment over journalism is an issue, and standing up against that is proper. There is nothing in the article to begin with that could be seen as slanderous, because it basically only gives actual facts. And even if you took Disney's side on that part of the argument, questioning journalistic integrity has other avenues to be addressed, and the issue of add based financing and the result on journalistic integrity is gigantic enough without attacking other journalists for standing up against one of those practices.

The video is basically a bait and switch. He disagrees with journalists siding with journalists, and the only argument he basically gives is ""Disney is can obviously do it"". Which is true, but is not an argument why the Journalists also should do what they can. There is a distinction between ""can legally"" and ""should morally"", and what he does is confuse the two arguing against the ""can and should"" of his fellow journalists, while shielding Disney from a ""should"" by arguing the ""can"".&&Nothing bad has come against Universal right?

\- Nostalgia Critic.&&I think it's the prominence and prevalence of their brand. Every kid has seen at least 5 Disney movies, they're ubiquitous and it's a shared cultural joy around the world. They've been around so long that kids, adults and grandparents alike all have fond memories of Disney experiences meaning society at large looks the other way at their transgressions. &&Do you have kids? Loving Disney, or not, isn’t really an option. There are 400+ amusement parks in the US and only 2 are Disney. So yeah, kids go apeshit. As far as “makes films these days,” they’ve been doing that for 80+ years already. Personally I don’t care if Disney chokes and dies on a dick tonight, I’m just pointing this out. You’re dismissing it like it’s a fucking spinner fad. We’re indefinitely stuck with them, and they’re too big to fail. Fucking Star fucking Wars.

I think it's pretty easy to see why people love Disney.&&I just love the star wars universe. Would love it no matter who owned it.&&I'd argue the characters are very special indeed. Why do you not think they are?

Any examples where they weren't?

I felt Stitch was a pretty fun character, going from being a bit of a beast to more controlled, with rage, Elvis and layers of emotion, in Lilo & Stitch specifically.

I also felt that Long John Silver had a nice bit to him, from being a greedy, cruel villain, to a loving, warm and encouraging father figure, in Treasure Planet. Obviously there's bits of that with Treasure Island already, but I'd argue moreso there.

Then, for Hunchback of Notre Dame, the villain is Frollo, when it comes to a man of God, of all people, in a *Disney* movie. He wants to kill the gypsies of Notre Dame, yet he actually *lusts* after one of them. He's meant to be a man of God, yet look at what he's trying to do, plus what he did to Quasimodos' mother. Lot of layers there.

I can go on about other characters if you'd like me to, but I think those examples show how special Disney characters can be, even if one's from Victor Hugo many years ago and another from Robert Louis Stevenson many years ago.

Still well worth noting.&&People do need to differentiate between their creative and business divisions, though. When people talk about how they love Disney, they probably meant [the studios](https://i.imgur.com/9BriWru.jpg) under Disney's umbrella. Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios is lead by John Lasseter and Ed Catmull (who himself was one of the most important figures in 3D graphics). Marvel Studios had Kevin Fiege, and so on.

The studios aren't perfect, we've heard a lot of complaints from workers about bad working conditions/compensation. But since they're mostly dealing on the creative sides of things, they're relatively a lot nicer than the rest of Disney.&&You can like the movies and hate the company that owns them.&&They are probably making a distinction that is technically accurate but unrealistic when considering human emotion.&&Not liking someone, but liking the things they make.

"Galaxy Quest is still one of a kind.

I can't think of any other film like it. First it's an excellent and loving parody to Star Trek. Second, it's actually a great science fiction adventure film with a good plot. The comedy is great, but the dramatic moments are just as impact. The part where Tim Allen has to explain to Balthzar that they are actors is heartbreaking. Everyone involved with the film seemed to totally understand and buy into what they were making. I can't think of another film that blends the line between parody and drama so flawlessly. Space Balls for example is a great parody, but has no serious sci-fi elements. 

EDIT: When I thought about it, maybe Ghostbusters is the best comparison. It's not a parody in any way, but it blends the line between comedy and it's horror elements perfectly.

RIP Alan Rickman. Great parody of Spock &&""Oh my god! Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy!""&&I had originally not wanted to see [Galaxy Quest] because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said ‘You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre.’ And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant.


No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact that there were fans who did understand the scientific principles on which the ship worked was absolutely wonderful. And it was both funny and also touching in that it paid tribute to the dedication of these fans.

Sir Patrick Stewart&&Fun fact: Tim Allen's character's character is named Peter Quincy Taggart after the character Peter Quince from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Peter Quince is the head of a group of skilled laborers who decide to put on a play for the royal wedding party. The group is mostly incompetent at dramatic arts&&""I know! Construct a weapon!

What was up with the paper bag that one guy dragged around for the first half of the movie?&&That's cause Galaxy Quest isn't a parody, it is a pastiche. It is celebrating the tropes of the genre not making fun of them. Think Kingsman vs. Austin Powers.

“Those poor people.”&&You should try the Orville. Far better than I expected. Decent comedy and has that splash of feels every once in awhile as well.&&If you watch carefully, you can see that during the scene when (Tim Allen) and (Sigourney Weaver) have to cross an inexplicable crushing pistons obstacle course (""The Chompers""), she clearly says ""well, fuck that!"", but the dialog was replaced with ""well, screw that"". 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqRdT8m1Suo&&I will not go out there, and nothing you say will change my mind..

Missing you Alan Rickman&&Galaxy quest has *soul*. It's a movie that makes you feel. I'm a person that normally approaches movies with the plot in mind. After the first 30 minutes, I was no longer thinking, I was *feeling*. To someone like me, that's a very rare boon. And then there was that second one .. which just did the same, only better. 

*I am groot*&&I like it too, but the plot is the same as the Three Amigos and Bug's Life.&&""By Grabthar's Hammer............. what a savings.""&&That line legit makes me cry every time when he says it to the dying crew mate.&&More than just a parody of Spock, his character was like a tribute to Leonard Nimoy, who had similar feelings about the character.&&""I played Richard the III""...Love Alan Richman.

More like Worf, actually. &&They wanted to make a Galaxy Quest 2 but Alan Rickman...

But now they could literally have (a) Zachary Quinto play Alan Rickman's character and it'd still work. &&my favorite part is when Weaver has to dodge those pistons and she's screaming ""why did they replicate the weird pistons?

The number of scenes that start with her zipper either far down and end with it up at her neck or the other way around is far too numerous to be an actual accident.&&There was a story from the set where Sigourney was supposed to walk across the bridge while she delivered her line.

Shawn of the Dead parodies zombie movies, Hot Fuzz parodies buddy cop movies, and The World's End parodies alien invasion movies. They're all definite parodies but end up being good examples of the genre they're parodying as well. &&Came here to say this. Shaun of the Dead is a perfect example of this type of movie. Pokes fun at the typical tropes and cliches of zombie movies (scene where they assume the zombie girl is just drunk). But at the same time has true horrific moments [(david's death)](#spoiler) and great character moments as well [(Shaun's mother)](#spoiler). On top of all this the movie is shot and directed perfectly. It's one of my absolute favorites. &&And then also Hot Fuzz in the buddy cop genre?&&FAQ About Time Travel  
  
John Dies At The End&&Tropic thunder does a great job at being a parody of war movies while still being a (albeit hilarious) “war” movie. &&""The creature has turned inside out *SPLOOSH!*.......and it exploded."" &&""The ship was a model as big as this!"" Alalallalalaa&&I do that laugh when people make a joke that lands totally flat, it's like an aural slap in the face.&&Tech Sgt. Chen has a bag Food. He's got the munchies. He's totally baked!&&Tony Shaloub’s character is eating snacks because he is supposed to be high and have the munchies. I know he carries around a paper bag for some of the movie with some snacks in it. Are you referring to someone else?&&TIL Book of Mormon is a pastiche.&&Of course it is making fun of the tropes. For example Weaver's characters only purpose being to talk to the computer. And the chompers which really have no meaningful purpose. Or how they just land on an alien planet and conveniently it has breathable air even though Guy says they might die. It doesn't portray these as great achievements of the genre but makes fun of them.

Galaxy Quest is a satire. It points out the illogical and silly aspects of Star Trek in a humorous way.&&Best way to serve this?&&Otherwise known as pastiche. &&Guys?!

Seth MacFarlane: Okay then.&&[deleted]&&Thanks. Came here to look for opinions on Orville. Exactly what I hoped to hear&&I'm honestly a little mad at how much better The Orville is at being star trek than the actual star trek show. The krill episode is really good, moral debate wise. Would you kill a dozen children to save thousands of lives? Reminds me of TNG. Really well done. The actual star trek show....its barely star trek. Its not good.&&Judging by the number of former Star Trek people that have been involved, actual Trekkies have chosen the Orville. There have been episodes either with guest stars or directors like Riker on the Orville, while ST:D has had almost none.&&Seriously, I read this thread title and immediately thought ""One of a kind? This guy hasn't watched The Orville""...&&I'm going to look into this, but I have no idea what you could talk about for more than an episode.&&Im from Buenos Aires, and I say Kill 'em All!&&[deleted]&&Starship Troopers is a parody of WWII propaganda films. &&The word you're looking for is, perhaps, pastiche. It's parody, but with the elements praised rather than mocked. Then again, with how tongue-in-cheek the film is, one could make an argument for either way. I'll stick with pastiche.&&Stop your foul whining, you filthy piece of distended rectum.&&I see Red Dwarf, I upvote the smegger!&&I still can't believe, in retrospect, how many things Red Dwarf did that come off as cliche now were actually original ideas at the time.&&Oh, he still definitely is.&&Yeah, there are [hints of it still](https://youtu.be/6mXWXwxPtXg?t=174), but it isn't fleshed out.  &&The film treats the nerds so affectionately, it was nice to see.

The whole film was a love letter to star trek, really.&&Red thingy moving towards the green thingy. I think...we’re the green thingy!&&It's not, definitely give it a shot.  As OP said, while it's a parody, it doesn't *feel* like one while you're watching it.  It's a great stand-alone film that builds off of the idea of Star Trek and its fans.&&In that case, so did Tropic Thunder.&&?......you literally gave an example of why Space balls is a great parody that doesn't have serious sci-fi elements.&&We've been jammed!

Classic&&I fucking miss John Candy&&I don't know what happened, but I just don't find Space Balls all that funny anymore. I watched it recently for the first time in a couple of years and none of the parts I used to like didn't do anything for me.

&&[deleted]&&Never seen a bugs life but I've probably seen three amigos at least a dozen times and never made this connection. &&I love Three Amigos, but Galaxy Quest does the drama better and is a stronger film. &&That little fake out he does with his lips before he says ""what a savings"" is comedy gold. It's like we're witnessing a man's soul take its final gasp before it dies. &&That face he makes in that pause. His entire being is screaming at him not to say it. I'm cracking up just thinking about it.&&This line was brought up as an example of why there needs to be an Oscar for Best Single Line Delivery.&&His whole role in that movie is a masterclass in comedic timing!&&Alan Rickman can pack so much tragedy, rage, injustice and disgust into a single line that you’d swear it was a McRib&&I got it&&And I still don't understand how ""a savings"" is proper grammar.&&I have this on a T-Shirt. I've stopped wearing it - because if you have to explain a joke, it's not funny.&&I think it's probably one of the most powerfully delivered lines in cinema. He *hates* being known for this line. He *dreads* having to say it. But in that moment, there is no hesitation and you can see that, for the first time, he's speaking these words, but he's **not** just delivering a line.&&Especially with that setup from the line before. The motivation and realization is amazing.&&Love it. He wrote an autobiography called I Am Not Spock and talked about how he hated the role following him around. But iirc, after a few more years, people who were children while the show was on had grown into adults and started approaching him telling him that he was their inspiration to become things like physicists, engineers, chemists... And it started to change his mind about his role.

And after a while, he wrote his second autobiography, I Am Spock.&&I think there's a bit of parody with Patrick Stewart too, or at least his stage background, and how odd it seemed at first that anyone would cast a Shakespearean actor in a sci-fi flick.&&It kind of pisses me off that they're not all set around Christmas time. &&Was...

Fuck i made myself sad.&&But he was really into it. Every appearance and interview shows he did it with his heart in it. Leonard Nimoy did actually get tired of the role which is understandable. Rabid fans really freak out the people involved.&&>living

Throughout the movie they jokingly go through every trope in cop movies and set up every part of the final climactic scene. Then in the end of the movie they just work their way through everything they set up in the first half one after the other in such a great fun hilarious way.&&Scott Pilgrim is also like this.

It's a perfect balance between a solid Star Trek show and a comedy. The jokes keep it fun and lighthearted, but are far enough apart that they hit harder when they come. You don't see them coming as much.&&This exactly. And he's toeing that line constantly, because 2-3 of those jokes are barely jokes. It's like Seth *really* wanted to do a Star Trek thats-not-a-family-guy-clone.&&My only real problem with it is that he can’t break away from pop culture references. It’s the year 24XX and they are still referencing Seinfeld and Friends and Destiny’s child.&&[deleted]&&Nah it's just that good. It has real plot and drama but with the perfect sprinkle of humor and sarcasm. &&Just a warning to anyone who came across this show here.  The first episode is TERRIBLE.  Suffers so much from being a pilot, over focuses on the two leads relationship drama, and rushes just to introduce everyone.  It's kind of a mess.  The second episode is barely better.

The third episode however is the closest you're ever going to get to building a time machine and going back to watch a classic TNG episode for the first time.  It's directed by Braga to boot (the next episode would be directed by Jonathan Frakes aka Commander Riker).  

Such a huge fan.  I've never been turned around faster on a show in a span of 3 episodes.&&I think there's a proportion of us who are just a bit tired with McFarlane's usual approach to humour. I have to say, though, after all I've seen of The Orville so far, maybe he is too. It's really quite good in a lot of ways. &&I don't like Seth McFarlane, honestly, personal preference though his humor is just not my cup of tea. Orville, though, man that's something different. Love Orville.&&People often forget how fucking godawful the first season of TNG was.  

Discovery's biggest problem, really, is the inexplicable Klingon redesign that puts the show on the wrong foot with hardcore Trekkies.&&I’m actually going to probably be the minority, but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Discovery. The mid season finale was INCREDIBLE. I like that it’s giving me something different, and I’m okay with the liberties they’ve taken advancing technology. I like to put into perspective that, TNG/VOY/DS9 all had objectively terrible 1st seasons, and while Discovery’s isn’t amazing, it’s starting off significantly stronger.&&Discovery is barely Star Trek... but I love it for being a very pretty SF, lots of serious action and some interesting characters.  The Orville is definitely more Trek, and I enjoy it.   &&That's cause MacFarlane understands Star Trek and has creative freedom.   The CBS executives that greenlit and shaped Discovery do not. 

I guarentee this is how Discovery was made:  Netflix (knowing how many of their users watch and rewatch Star Trek) desperately tried to get the rights to it and create their own TV show for subscribers.  CBS execs were smart enough to realize not to do this, and understood they had a potential gold mine on their hands, so they decided they needed a new Trek show for a streaming app but had zero idea how to execute it properly.&&Even Brannon Braga worked on The Orville &&Let's not forget the greatest Doctor ever as Alaras dad! &&Haha, yeah we talk about that a lot! &&I'm doing my part!&&Its the smartest dumb movie of all time.&&It's Verhoeven taking the satire of the book, and dialing it up to 10,000,000,000.&&like what?&&I'm surrounded by assholes!&&When Micheal Winslow talks with the same distortion without the mic and Moranis flips out, gives me giggle fits everytime.&&Only one man dare give me the raspberry...&&They're all parodies of Seven Samurai - which was probably inspired by folk tales.&&I have always worked under the assumption that had he not gotten swept up into a magical space adventure he would have gone home to kill himself that night.&&[For those of you who haven't seen it, or just want to watch it again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgv7U3GYlDY) That pause is incredible, there's so much going on in that moment of hesitation there. You can tell he's considering killing himself rather than delivering the line.&&My favorite line is how he says, ""[Damn you](https://youtu.be/uDJsCE01LYI)"" to Tim Allen.  Time stamp is at 2:01 but I linked the whole scene because it's great. &&I like the part where Sam Rockwell's character, Guy Fleegman, is screaming about dying since he's an unknown on the show as they descend in the smaller craft towards the planet. Rickman is sitting across the aisle rolling his eyes in annoyance as Guy loses his shit. &&*Acting*&&That's a great example of how great an actor Rickman was. He's having a fantastic time in real life portraying an actor whose miserable and trying to pretend he isn't.

&&He was so good. Impossible to not tear up.&&Crap, I'm gonna tear up from this comment thread. &&I think this anecdote captures the tension that Nimoy (and probably most Trek actors) felt between their character and themself. And Nimoy handled it so well:

>*Do fans still expect you to be as conversant in “Star Trek” lore and mythology as they are?*

>I had an embarrassing experience once, many years ago. I was invited to go to CalTech and was introduced to a number of very brilliant young people who were working on interesting projects. They walked me through, and they would [say] we’re doing this and we’re doing that, and we’re trying to figure out why this is happening. And then they’d say to me, “What do you think?” Expecting me to have some very sound advice. And I would nod very quietly and very sagely I would say, “You’re on the right track.”

Was at a Dark Shadows convention 10 years or so ago and the main character actor, [Jonathan Frid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Frid), was attending for the first time in almost two decades (I think, it was a LONG ass time). He always felt some contempt for the show because he was a trained Shakespearean actor and thought it was silly as all get out. But attending that convention he watched bits of the show *with* the audience and said later that he could feel the love emanating from the crowd. It totally changed his perspective on the work he had done. It was really touching.&&Or of British actors in general.  Most of the RADA/RSC gang that picked up parts in Star Wars were not amused by it, and some were put off by Lucas' shitty dialogue but they'd be damned if they'd let any of us critics slam them so they elevated the worst dialogue with the greatest line delivery.&&Have you seen what e was on before Star Trek?

Not like he wasn’t already a well established genre actor. &&This may not be true because I read it on reddit but IIRC the first two were written to be die hard scripts, after that they started adapting scripts for other movies.

I was at an early screening for an anime where they showed the first 3 episodes before the show started airing. One of the characters said something totally out of the blue (in-fiction, anyway. Audience knew it was coming) and the other main character didn't really react. She just sorta looked dumbfounded and confused. 

So one guy in the audience, way up front, during this awkward pause in the dialogue, goes ""Eeee^ee^ee^ee^ehhhhhh!?!?!?!?"" and everyone cracked up.

My high school theater club did Little Shop of Horrors and its the version that sticks with me even now.

 [Sorry Dexter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nW3-9gdjYA)&&I avoided the show for the longest time because I thought it was going to be Family Guy In Space, and I'm absolutely sick of family guy. 

So pleasantly surprised. I was watching it and thinking, shit, this really isn't that funny... but it feels more like Star Trek than any of the recent Star Trek shit, especially the action movies. Even the Seth humor feels fitting for some strange reason. They're basically a Utopian society where they have more starships than capable captains, so it's the story of a loser and his buddy who want to explore and are on the low end of who's acceptable enough. It's a Utopian future where even dipshits get to play their part in exploration of the galaxy. I fucking love it.&&I agree, I think they could have made one character weirdly obsessed with 21st century pop culture, just as a personality quirk. And have nobody else understand it as the gag. But it's really weird seeing pretty much every human character frequently dropping 21st century pop culture references.&&Agree, and it’s worth mentioning that Star Trek would constantly reference “Earth’s late 20th Century” in dialogue. 
&&I think that's what makes it funny. Would you rather they reference some future event or tv show that you've never heard of?&&Meh.. it's no worse than Roddenberry's Shakespeare obsession.&&There's a fan theory floating around that the Federation in Star Trek results from a civilization that's been creatively stagnant for centuries, and never recovered their inspiration after seeing the horrors of nuclear war.  They see the period from 1590 (Shakespeare's first play) to 2026 (Start of World War 3) as humanity's creative Golden Age.  This is why almost all cultural references in the show hit that specific 430-year period.

The theory goes on to postulate that the Federation's reason for exploring without interference is about bringing artistic inspiration back to Earth.&&Praise Saint Bortus!&&Honestly it's more Star Trek than Discovery...&&I completely agree. The first two were.. mediocre comedic fare. All of sudden it becomes a plot driven show with some comedy thrown in.&&It feels more like old-school star trek series than Star Trek Discovery even.  You can tell Seth just gets what made Star Trek unique and was a huge fan. 
 They were sci-fi shows that weren't about space battles and action, but about the characters and ethical dilemmas of contacting and interacting with alien civilizations in a post-monetary society (except for the Ferengi).  It manages to be a serious drama with really thoughtful plots, while also being incredibly funny at just the right moments.  It's probably my favorite new network show in quite some time, it's just so damn good and so many things remind me of why I loved Star Trek in the first place and Seth is a way better actor than I ever thought he would be and has matured incredibly as a writer.  I fucking love this show.&&That and it takes 3 and a half minutes for a Klingon to spit out one sentence.&&wait people have actually seen the show? I was going to watch it on CBS but ohh wait CBS isn't airing their flagship show on their own network.&&Ironically, I think, enterprise had the best first season, but the show never caught on, and the seasons after that were even better.&&Would you like to know more?&&Im going to give that to 'Hot Fuzz' honestly&&He did go home that night.

Rickman had such a great, silent, ""oh, for fucks sake."" &&Then when he says the line to the crewman fanboy at the climax, filled with meaning and emotion.&&I don't think I've ever seen Rickman give a bad performance. He was in some less that great movies but, he was always the best thing in them.&&damn, for being 50-something there, she is freaky hot.&&I love the balloons and the wind / car sounds in the background -- it's like the cinematic equivalent of bass guitar here.

Not enough love for the audio engineers&&I love his character so much! He takes acting so seriously that he has no choice but to give the part his all, even though he considers the show low brow and superficial. 

Alexander: “You’re just going to have to figure out what it wants. What is its motivation?”

RADA/RSC = The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art / Royal Shakespeare Company&&I thought it was a script intended for Lethal Weapon 4, that's why they added Samuel L Jackson to play the Murtaugh part.  And a script that could have been used to make Die Hard 3 was used to make Speed 2 on one of the slowest vessels for human passengers, a cruise ship.  And the reason they were missing a script was because it was used to make Under Siege 2 on a train.

I don't recall it very much in the other series.&&It sounds better in the original Klingon.&&You will be silent! &&Yeah, I remember reading the direction Star Trek wanted to go some time back. They were looking to break the old molds, give consequences to the action, and make the violence and death feel more real and impactful. They wanted it grittier, darker, and more modern.

Discovery is definitely not even trying to be like old school Trek.  And I'd be OK with that if they didn't make it a fucking prequel to TOS.  Occasionally you'll hear a familiar whistle or something but for the most part *nothing* about Discovery screams pre-TOS.  Why did they not just set it after Voyager?  I don't know, that decision will forever boggle my mind.&&One of the things that stands out the most to me about the Orville is that episodes don’t always end happily.

There was an executive decision to tone down the R level humor.

&&People are still gonna know Shakespeare in 300 years. They're not going to know the Kardashians.&&It was mostly one character influencing other characters in one series. And Shakespeare could be still popular for history, English, and theater education in 500 more years.&&Entering the glory hole&&i know people are dissapointed that discovery did that, but im real glad they went different ways.&&Plus Bortus is obviously based on Worf, and Isaac is obviously based on Data, and I love that it even pays homage to even older sci-fi shows from the 40s and 50s in that the the android's costume is so basic and parts of it are obviously just silver-painted latex.&&You've just sold me on it completely.&&I didn't know that, thats awesome and explains why it feels so much like TNG.  The doctor on the show was also Sisko's girlfriend on Deep Space Nine, and I bet at some point Frakes and his glorious beard will have a guest-starring role if he is involved in the show.&&Not to mention that Seth himself played one of Trip's engineers on ENT. He's that much of a fan that he would jump at playing a bit part on a not-so-good spinoff that, regardless, still captured the soul of what it means to be Trek.

I will say I was pleasantly surprised at Braga's involvement in the show. I've always felt he was behind some of the more... dubious choices, particularly with regards to Voyager (the massive nerfing of the Borg from ""literally Cthulhu"" to ""slightly dangerous villain of the week"" for example), but when I found out that he wrote *and* directed the episode where Isaac is trapped on the planet with Claire's kids, I was blown away even more than just by the episode itself, which is already the best episode to date of the series.&&It was apparently originally supposed to be an anthology series, sorta like American Horror Story, where each season would follow different characters in different eras. But then Bryan Fuller stepped down as the showrunner and, presumably, CBS decided to stick with the initial setting for convenience. &&I just wrote this exact post before seeing yours. Seriously my only complaint about the show is the baffling decision to make it a prequel.  It makes no sense and raises all sorts of continuity questions for fans (why didn’t voyager try out a spore drive? Even if it’s really dangerous prohibited tech seems like it’s something they would have considered). 

Personally I’ve just been assuming that it’s set in the kelvin timeline (even though they’ve said that it’s not) as that addresses most of the continuity issues and the design of the series is obviously based on the movies anyway. 

Setting it post voyager would have made the most sense but it’s almost like sequels have become passé as the entire industry has become obsessed with prequels. &&That Krill episode... that was almost as much of a gut punch as one of those Law & Order endings where the plot itself is resolved but you're left wondering if you made the right decision.&&By old-school Star Trek I was including TNG, (It was 30 years ago) but you are absolutely correct, TNG seems to be the main series it is emulating and partially parodying.  Seth feels like he is playing a combination of Picard and Kirk to me.&&The theme song was the worst part of ENT without a doubt lol. It did a great job of reaching the root morality of the star trek franchise while still portraying a great concept of the universe pre-federation. Also it gave us some cool development of the vulcans which I did not expect until I saw the 4th season. Personally (I might be crucified for this) I thought it was better than VOY and DS9.. also it did take me a few episodes to warm up to archer. As a captain he didnt have the same larger-than-life feel I got from Kirk, Picard, cisco or Janeway but he really grew on me by mid first season.  &&I have no real evidence to make this claim, but I feel like in the early/mid-2000s it was hard for shows with 3+ episode arcs to catch on in popularity. Seems like nowadays this is a staple on every popular show. Netflix/hulu have made it more possible to enjoy these types of shows as originally intended. Enterprise was before its time.&&I respect Enterprise a lot more now after watching Discovery.&&Every time I watch it, I'm blown away by a different aspect of it. Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead are easily two of my favorite comedies, if not my favorite comedies ever. &&Rickman is the realest actor of the bunch. &&and then there's [Con Man](https://youtu.be/fiGqkZO9p1Y).&&And in that era they had cult followings, but they weren’t really respected by the mainstream.  Now they win academy awards and make box office hits.&&I wonder what changed? Sure the prices went up so they probably make more. But if I had to guess it'd be because unlike in the past, being in sci-fi is no longer has the connotation of ""can't get better parts"" *and* the fan base can be very loyal which is important when trying to market yourself as an actor. If you come with a fan base already that's sometimes half the battle. &&You might enjoy this in that case https://youtu.be/ndr7HTZsReQ&&I think Sigourney was too. I remember watching an interview where she mentions that Tim was always goofing off while her and Alan were just trying to get the job done.

>**[Sigourney] Weaver**: He had this piece of the wall of the Nostromo or something, and he was so proud of it. I wrote on it: “Stolen by Tim Allen. Love, Sigourney Weaver”

>**[Tim] Allen**: She eventually signed it with a smart-ass comment.

>**Weaver**: He was so upset. “Why would you write that?! I was going to put it in my screening room!” Which was such a Hollywood thing to say.

>**Allen**: She never asked me to sign anything. She doesn't care.&&Oh man, I can't believe I'd never seen the oral history before - thank you! This is amazing. I've bookmarked it so I can savor it always. Honestly, reading through this whole thread is giving me welling feelings of love and warmth toward Galaxy Quest. Even hearing the 'original show's [theme music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI5hi4c4y9k) still gives me shivers. Not joking. The music's _that_ good. 

I remember last year I was attempting to figure out if I could show Galaxy Quest to a friend who's never seen any Star Trek, really, with a reasonable hope that she might like it despite the lack of background. I never came to a decision, but this thread is once again making me wonder if I could get away with it.&&'You received ""Romantic Comedy"". Better luck next time!'&&here's an [article from cracked](http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-simple-rules-not-screwing-up-die-hard-sequel/) stating such... Jump to number 4 ""Write a Movie That Isn't Die Hard"".

> A Good Day to Die Hard is the first script that was written just to be a Die Hard movie. Ever. The first Die Hard was originally written as a sequel to Commando (or a sequel to The Detective, depending on which source you consult), but when Arnold dropped out, they changed it at the last minute into a Die Hard. Die Hard 2: Die Harder was originally a book called 58 Minutes about a cop named Frank Malone who probably never even Die Harded a little bit. Die Hard With a Vengeance was originally supposed to be Lethal Weapon 4, but that also changed at the last minute, probably because turning Danny Glover's ""too old for this shit"" good cop into a ""too racist for this shit"" lunatic upset the buddy cop dynamic established in the first three. Finally, Live Free or Die Hard was originally called WW3.com, and it was based on a Wired article. About hacking. No one has ever started a movie with the intention of writing a Die Hard. Good Die Hard scripts are like McClane himself; they're the right script in the wrong place at the wrong time.&&This quote has stuck with me more than many others from cinema. I have found myself asking people if they could construct a rudimentary lathe in many situations. I look around desperately to see if anyone gets the reference. They never do...&&Did any of you guys actually watch the show?&&And it's not like we don't all think it while watching Star Trek, too. When I was going through The Original Series, I would tell almost the exact words at the TV. 

It's infuriating!&&That makes so much sense. Shaloub is almost terminally chill.&&I'd love to see a director's cut.&&I figured he was always stoned, but you just never saw him smoking. Whether or not you actually saw him smoke a joint didn’t change the fact that he was stoned. 

“That was a hell of a thing....heheh.” &&Annnnnd the movie just got that much better. &&One ~~fuck~~""fuck"" doesn't increase the rating to R immediately, it takes two for that, for whatever reason. There's a solid ""fuck"" in *The Core* as well, as I distinctly remember while watching that movie in school.

EDIT: One *fuck* will absolutely make it R, but one *""fuck""* won't.&&> They're not going to know the Kardashians.

You can't *know* that though.

Shakespeare's plays were considered lowbrow at the time, for all we know in a few hundred years people will be viewing Adam Sandler the same way we view Shakespeare today.&&It still felt incredibly out of place. Everyone was well versed in Shakespeare but there were zero references to current culture. No songs, TV shows, culture, film, anything. The first new thing you see is data writing a poem about his fucking cat. &&I’ve been really digging discovery but the one thing that I can’t get over is that it’s supposed to be (another) prequel to TOS which makes no sense especially given the overall storyline of developing this super advanced tech. 

Why couldn’t it be set after the other series?  Making it a prequel adds literally no value (other than getting to use the klingons) and raises all sorts of pointless continuity questions. 

They at least could have made it kelvin universe as that would have addressed a lot of the differences but they didn’t even do that. 

Honestly I don’t really get why the industry has become obsessed with prequels over sequels.  So many franchises have become bloated with pointless backstory (looking at you Alien). &&Isaac even sounds a lot like Brent Spiner.&&Isaac's costume is so cheesey.  It's the best.&&Frakes and Robert Duncan McNeil have both directed episodes, and The Doctor from Voyager had a cameo on last weeks episode. 

Considering his work on American Dad, i wouldnt be surprised if they get Patrick Stewart for an episode too. &&> for convenience.

For profit. Not as many sets to design, you can lock actors into longer contracts incase their career suddenly takes off&&The later episodes don’t have Fuller’s hands on them - and it shows. The first two episodes were clearly a different kind of Trek. And it burned a lot of people, yes. 

But the later episodes have increased exponentially in both writing, style, and shows the spirit of Trek is still viable. 

I have a feeling Fuller leaving is probably for the best. &&I was really expecting the episode with the baby to go differently than it did. &&""No I can play 30""

_Rico from Starship Troopers scoffs_&&[deleted]&&So, a documentary about Firefly? I’m in!!&&This looks good. How is it?&&only $4.99 to buy the first season on amazon.

Yes!"" - so it was a combination of the perception of Science Fiction as entertainment changed, both the makeup and perception of Fandom changed, how actors in SF went from typecast to cast for type, the opportunities within SF exploded and, last but not least, there's money in that there Sci-Fi stuff... especially for preexisting IP. *cough*DisneyMCU*cough* In short, it wasn't one thing, but many, coming together to make Sci-Fi the Genre Juggernaut it is in today's entertainment industry... with actors from all walks wanting to hitch a ride.&&If you watch any interviews with Sir Patrick Stewart about working on TNG, he often mentions how at first he was upset that some of the cast members (like Frakes) were always goofing off while others like himself took it very seriously. But eventually everyone, including himself started having fun and goofing around, and he said it made it a far better work environment.&&He was clearly just in character to help them channel their characters' disdain for his character. &&Go figure comedians goof off. Haha I'm sure that's a problem with a lot of movies like that.&&That's why he was the perfect guy to cast for the role lol&&That's kind of amazing, to be honest.&&To be honest I would laugh knowing I heard it before but totally forgotten where it came from....

I wouldn’t want to work somewhere where everyone takes themselves too seriously.

I think they try not to waste everyone’s time and money. 

There’s an interview with Sigourney during one of the Alien movies where she talks about stressing over trying to do the scene right, recognizing that every time she screwed up she was costing them a lot of money. &&I have it on VHS. With the Hollywood Video sticker on the side.

I do agree, though-- if the content is worthy it should be nominated, no matter where it's from.&&They have been recognized; the only debate being a need for theatrical release to earn consideration. &&Amazon will likely get recognized again for The Big Sick this year. At least I am hoping it will be. I think it deserves a best original screenplay nomination. &&How about just not recognize the Oscars? It's an awards ceremony for a private industry. Make an internet based film award ceremony.&&Amazon has been recognized and Netflix will when they make a worthy film. It sounds like Mudbound might be that one.&&They are recognised. Netflix films have been nominated for several oscars and they have even won one for ""The White Helmets"", and Amazon has won oscars for ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""The Salesman""&&They need theatrical releases &&Or... we could let what is a glorified ad for movies and celebrity be less relevant. &&Amazon was, Manchester by the Sea. Netflix can produce a movie worthy of a nomination and I’m sure the Academy will acknowledge it. Netflix only produces lifetime grade content it’s no surprise they aren’t getting awards.&&Maybe Netflix should really run an Oscar campaign. Amazon did and won a lot of awards.&&And this year's award for best comedy goes to.... ""Ridiculous Six 2: Electric Boogaloo""&&Nolan blasted Netflix a while back and I agree with his sentiments. As much as I love Netflix and the kind of shows and movies it makes, I would hate to see movie theatres die. Neither do I want to see something like The Irishmen when it releases on Netflix. Also, I don't understand Netflix's aversion towards traditional format.&&HBO films has been making great films for decades. Unless it's shown in the theater it's a Emmy, not a Oscar. &&At least in Netflix’ case, they should make better movies, then we can talk. Because so far, all the Netflix originals I have seen have been mediocre or worse. Much worse.&&I agree with this. Netflix and Amazon are taking the chances on the films that the studios don't anymore.

And honestly, they are really starting to hit their stride with quality movies. *Wheelman* and *Gerald's Game* on Netflix were 2 of the best movies I've seen this year. *Brawl On Cell Block 99* might be my favorite movie I've seen this year and I don't think it even came out in theaters. It cost me like $7 for a 2 day rental on Amazon. I still think that's a way better deal than paying $15 to go sit in a theater for 2 hours, have to sit through 25 mins of previews till you get to the movie. Plus I'd rather watch it at home then be surrounded by a hundred other noisy assholes.&&Netflix hasn’t made anything worthy of an Oscar&&All they need to do is release movies theatrically qualify. HBO does this with their documentaries as well as movies like Real Women Have Curves, American Splendor and some others. Both of those were academy award nominees if I remember correctly.&&In order for a movie to qualify for the Oscar's it must be released in a theater in Los Angeles County.&&I think you mean Emmys. The Oscars are for movies, and 95% of the movies on Netflix are low-budget trash that nobody ever watches. They have good shows, though.&&How about the opposite where Netflix has their own awards listing that's super fancy? That would probably attract some of the attention from the other bank if their movies could get heaps more viewers. &&Red Oaks anyone? Mad Dogs was dope too. Amazon needs more love. bringing back The Tick alone deserves a nod.&&Isn’t Mudbound getting some Oscar attention?&&Why? Who cares? As a movie watcher I️ don’t care if it gets recognized or not! Maybe the actors do because an Oscar is considered a huge deal to some/most actors. &&I completely agree with this. A lot of A-lister actors and actresses are moving to the small screen for work, which includes Netflix, Amazon, Hulu etc. The fact that these platforms are producing outstanding award circuit work says a lot for those platforms. I haven’t been able to watch any movies that are receiving a lot of Oscar buzz such as Mudbound, Wonderstruck, etc. This should definitely be considered. I seen The Big Sick it was such a lovely and natural story about a man and women from completely to different background learning and understanding each other and what love means to them. It was so refreshing and very very related since we live in such a diverse society nowadays. If this movies that are receiving Oscar/Golden Globe buzz for the 2018 awards ceremonies completely forgot about there is definitely something wrong with Hollywood.&&I think that if the movie is worthy of being nominated, then there should not be any limitations because of where it was produced.  &&Honestly, Netflix and Amazon have really great prods and they really should be recognized, apart from just the actors

&&Wasn't Manchester by the sea nominated? &&People still watch this circle jerk? Who cares if Netflix or Amazon don't get recognition in a dumb award ceremony notorious for throwing their awards at movies that fulfill a stereotypical checklist of 'oscar bait'?&&This doesn't make any sense.

Haven't seen a single netflix original that was above a B- to be honest. Sure, there are shows or movies that have really cool, singular, shots, but nothing remained solid all the way through. Half the time they blow their load on that one shot.&&I’m only commenting on this post because it hit r/all, but who gives a fuck about the oscars these days besides people directly related to the film industry? Do you guys? Isn’t it pretty apparent that the oscars are just a dick rubbing and cash passing scheme between big wigs in Hollywood. They make no impact on my life or what I choose to watch [citation needed] because I’ll watch whatever looks good and I’m sure everyone here can agree to some extent too.

Not because I think Cannes or the Oscars hold much weight for me, but that these streaming services are literally keeping original content from dying in the film industry. It just really annoyed me. &&Are they not?&&What's funny about this, is that by not recognizing top quality motion pictures because of a petty dispute with their release structure, the Academy Awards stands to lose footing as the premiere acknowledgement in terms of awards.

When Netflix consistently produces movies of a quality on par or better than Academy nominated movies, it's only a matter of time before their recognition means less and less. &&Correct me if I'm wrong but Netflix's *White Helmets* and Amazon's *Manchester by the Sea* were both nominated/won an Oscar.&&I totally agree but the academy, and major studios are not a big fan of sharing the lime light, plus all the BS politics that go along with it also.

Netflix doesn't do that.

Edit: However, I still think they should have for at least a couple movies. An Oscar is bound to attract subscribers.&&Manchester was *distributed* by Amazon Studios. It was in theaters. This headline is saying that movies released only online (i.e. Netflix and Amazon Prime original movies) should be recognized.

I go through Amazon all the time looking for stuff to watch, but nothing looks very good on its face in terms of their original programming. If anyone could point me in the right direction, that would be amazing. I'm not picky, but everything looks so boring and dry.&&mind blowing looks like in future amazon might beat google :)&&Has a direct-to-video movie ever won an Academy Award?&&Yeah, Amazon does the best of both worlds. Put out a movie in theaters for the standard two months, then release it straight to Amazon Prime a couple months after that. Netflix rarely ever does that (I know Okja was playing in one theater in LA and one in NYC for literally two weeks), and even if they do, their movies aren't at the same quality. 

Manchester by the Sea absolutely deserved the two Oscars it won. Beasts of No Nation is maybe the only movie that should've been nominated for Netflix, and even that may be a stretch. They need to step their game up.&&That was an Amazon original? I saw that in theatres randomly and thought it was really great. Definitely deserves an award.&&100% will get it. Though I don't think anything beats Get Out in that category this year.&&Out on Amazon Prime Video today! &&Do you want Oscar McOscarface?&&It's the same people doing all the work though. The Oscars is for the actors, writers, directors, producers, editors, effects artists... It's not for the people who own the companies. Their slightly unique business model shouldn't matter. &&The Oscars are more of a good thing in my opinion because it does give an incentive to studios to give good filmmakers money to make unique, well-crafted movies like Shape of Water or Moonlight. It takes a shit ton of time to build an awards show with as big of an influence of the Oscars so I'd rather work on fixing the Oscars instead of starting from scratch.&&Hard pass. It would be bad in a completely different way. &&Isn't this what IMDB made for?&&Personally I would rather see an award that viewers voted for. I can appreciate great art, but truly great entertainment matters more to me most days.  &&""It's not about us! It shouldn't exist!"" - The Internet&&So the dark Knight would win every year? Please God no.&&The Oscars are based more on technical knowledge of movies and film, not simply which film was the most popular. If that was the case, that silent, black and white film that won best picture a few years ago would never have won such a thing, because it certainly didn't break records at the box office. 

The Oscars isn't a popularity contest (which is what it would become through a popular-internet vote), it has to do more with the technical aspect of the film industry. The general public just isn't educated in film enough to have a real say in the matter.

Honestly, making the Oscars an internet vote would diminishing what it means to win one because most people on the internet have no idea what they are even talking about. Just because your opinion isn't being considered doesn't mean the awards should not be recognized.&&Great we've all seen based on Szechuan sauce that the internet begets such wisdom. &&Idris Elba killed it in Beasts of No Nation&&Netflix won best Short form documentary last year for The White Helmets. &&Beasts of No Nation was definitely worthy, nearly every awards group other than the academy at least recognized Elba, which the academy should have done. &&I thought Meyerowitz Stories was good enough in terms of acting and writing to at least warrant some consideration as well, but it seems like the buzz for that one came and went.

Maybe because the most likely nominee was probably Dustin Hoffman, who's name has come up a few times in light of some not so flattering allegations. Maybe not who Netflix wants to be campaigning for right now so soon after terminating their relationship with Kevin Spacey.&&Okay I guess this is going to be an upopular opinion but I didn't think Mudbound was that good. The narration seemed out of place, the pace was painfully slow and the ending was frustrating in several ways [namely the fact that there is no way they wouldn't lynch him, and the fact that it took a good 10 minutes for me to be certain if they did or didn't kill him at the end](#spoiler) not only that we also have yet another unnecessary romance sub plot that ends up adding nothing and goes nowhere. And another thing is the part where [the one farmer rapes his kids and is murdered by his wife](#spoiler) came out of pretty much nowhere, was never revisited or extrapolated upon. It could have added a good amount of intrigue in the slow moving plot.


Edit: I should add the cinematography was gorgeous for most of the film. There were some very clearly low budget shots however that I feel could have been improved vastly if they had the funds to add some things.&&Amazon already does full theatrical releases&&It makes me wonder. Did movie studios freak out when the VHS movie rental was first invented because it gave people an incentive to not go to the theater?&&They need movies that aren't completely mediocre. Netflix has the weakest line up of original films of any name brand studio/distributor I can think of. &&[deleted]&&I don't see a problem with having an ad for small productions. They get no recognition otherwise.&&Award shows are *by far* not a perfect entity.  But if it weren't for the Oscars, so many great films would have a fraction of the viewership they end up getting. 

And these aren't billion-dollar box office titans we're talking about.  These are movies that the average person should see, yet would most likely not end up seeing or even hearing about if it weren't for the recognition that comes from the awards circuit.
&&this is also why i dont care about it, i'd love something like this without all the famous people and instead maybe give the directors/dp's and other crew more a spotlight since they put a ton of effort in it. (Might be a bit biased since i work in film as cameraman lmao)&&Exactly. It's just a trade show.  Why anyone would watch it or care about the ""winners"" is beyond me &&You might see it that way. Those that work in the film industry probably see it differently, because it is still a prestigious honor.&&Movie theaters were afraid that home television would kill theaters. They thought the same thing with VHS. There's no reason to believe that Netflix will be able to kill them off. Theaters aren't going anywhere any time soon.&&What did Nolan say? I haven't heard about this. &&I don't understand why they don't release it in theaters and 2 months later bring to the service. No subscriber would be mad, it would actually create some hype around the movie (a lot of Netflix movie are completely unknown). And Netflix would actually profit with them.
&&Are movies disqualified from Emmy consideration if they are shown in a theatre?

Several of Netflix's movies have been showed theatrically, if they are not eligible for Emmys because they are eligible for Oscars, maybe Netflix is shooting themselves in the foot by even doing theatrical releases. an Emmy is better than no award at all.&&Thank you. Everyone acts like just cause Netflix produces movies that are ""riskier"" than the big studio's projects it automatically makes them amazing when they're actually pretty average. &&I highly suggest you go watch Mudbound. While no classic, it’s a fantastic film, and hands down the best Netflix original movie to date.&&Brawl on Cell Block 99 wasn't an Amazon movie, they just distributed it like any other straight to VOD movie.

Amazon Studios movies all get theatrical releases and have their branding on them. Stuff like Manchester by the Sea, Wonderstruck, Last Flag Flying, Wonder Wheel, The Big Sick, The Lost City of Z, etc. They don't have issues with being recognized, it's Netflix that does.&&> Netflix and Amazon are taking the chances on the films that the studios don't anymore.

Uhhh...Paramount and mother! and WB and BR2049. Simply not true.

Also there were a bajillion movies this year better than Gerald's Game.&&Netflix takes fewer risks than any studio. They’re notorious for being starfuckers who won’t hear a pitch unless there’s an established talent/name/prodco involved. I don’t know why people think Netflix takes risks. &&> Netflix and Amazon are taking the chances on the films that the studios don't anymore.

That's just hyperbole. Look at Paramount's release schedule this year, for example: several smaller to mid level budget movies that ""take chances"", whatever that really means. They released ""Get Out"", for example. Do you consider that a main-stream box office shoe-in that was destined to print money at the expense of artistic vision? I'd say that takes more chances than Wheelman, a standard action/chase thriller that revolves around a filming gimmick that ends up being the movie's biggest weakness, IMO.

And Netflix gave Adam Sandler a bazillion dollars to make a half dozen garbage pile movies, and is absolutely riddled with 2 star horse shit movies they bought the rights to, so try not to get too high on that horse.&&Four of their original documentaries have been nominated.&&Mudbound and The Meyerowitz Stories are both deserving of nominations this year IMO, in addition to some of their docs&&*Beasts of No Nation* was absolutely Oscar worthy. &&Mudbound.

The academy doesn't like that. &&That’s just completely untrue. I get “for your consideration” screeners from Netflix all the time. &&There are rules to be considered for an Oscar, you either follow the rules or get them changed in preparation. Was Beast Of No Nation a fantastic movie? Yes. Did they qualify for an Oscar? No because they refused to play by the simple theatrical release rules.

There are so many movies every year that win awards that were no name, low budget movies that played by the rules.

I am a HUGE supporter of Netflix but if they don't want to play by the rules then playtime wolnt follow.&&You mean like they've done with multiple movies already?&&I think perhaps that's a rule that the Academy should consider changing.

I’m sure there are more examples but films have to be theatrical to be nominated for Oscars. 


The first movie to win Best Picture while already being on home video was Silence of the Lambs&&Amazon runs it’s movies in theaters.  That was actually a factor for Kumail Nanjiani picking Amazon as the distributor over Netflix; he wanted the movie to have a theatrical run and Netflix doesn’t really do that.  &&It was an indie movie bought by Amazon, but that's how some ""originals"" are with Amazon and Netflix. &&Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri will take best Original Screenplay.

I don't know, while I don't necessarily trust the opinions of the academy, I also don't really trust the opinions of the audiences at large either. This is the same public that didn't come out to watch Blade Runner 2049 but makes Transformers tons of money; I don't think the average person necessarily is a good judge of a what makes for a good film (not that my opnions are right either, but Im just another member of the public at large too.)

BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR WAS IRON MAN 9 BECAUSE IT FUCKING RULED!!

Criteria for that is ""movie where the most cool things happen."" Christ almighty no thank you.

That said, the Oscars have gotten boring and predictable. Oh your movie was Socially Relevant ^^TM ? Well... Spotlight it is, best picture of the year. Meanwhile Lynch has never won an Oscar and somehow a horror movie hasn't been nominated for best picture since The Exorcist in the 70s.

&&Like the Shorty and Streamy Awards? Have you seen how cringey and bad those awards are? &&> Personally I would rather see an award that viewers voted for.

There is one, it's called the MTV Movie & TV Awards. I'm sure you now know why the Oscars, which is voted for by only current and retired film professionals is important.

If you want one that is just voted for by critics, that is the Golden Globes, but the pool of critics that vote is so small it is quite easy to sway a significant proportion of voters with gift baskets to make a difference in result.&&The popular vote can't be trusted. Mob rule is a dangerous precedent to set. &&-Oscar award winning *The Room*&&Didn't twilight win like a billion mtv teen choice awards.  So I imagine that. &&watch mtv movie awards then.

Teenagers however, do&&That would be awful.... critics get their job for a reason (refined taste) and it's not cause they think like everyone else &&Really?

Because thats what MTV Movie Awards is.

Twilight, 50 Shades and Transformers would win

&&As much as it should be just about performances it's still not though. Oscar buzz is a real thing and maybe people think that it's unfair that theatrical release is tied to awards fame but that's where the buzz comes from. It's all about that word of mouth and theater experience. Netflix could release the next Citizen Kane and it would get lost between the new season of The Ranch and iBoy in the new queue and those who do watch it in their living room won't receive the same impact they might in a dark room full of other excited movie goers watching a screen bigger than said living room. 

That's just the way it is. They can fight movie theaters and be on the opposing side but that's the collateral damage. Movie theaters are how the general public watches new movies.&&Whose nomination would have bumped to put him in though?  It was a really strong year.  &&Were also nominated for Best animated short, with World of Tomorrow.&&Word. Hopefully Mudbound is the one.&&And Manchester by the Sea was recognized a ton last year. Transparent as won tons of Emmys as well. Netflix just needs to do theatrical runs of their movies (not just in two theatres for one week) if they want to be considered. Theatre releases build buzz Netflix. Netflix hasn’t had any Netflix Original movie get buzz because they aren’t hyped on TV and everywhere for a long time. Maybe Netflix doesn’t care though.&&Yes&&Actually, they did. Well, they freaked out about VHS in general, not just rentals. They were also upset that people could use VHS to record stuff on TV. Pretty sure they freaked out about home television sets too, actually. Afraid that people would just sit home and watch TV and never go to the movie theater.&&There was real anxiety that video rental was killing cinema in the 1980's. In fact, attendance figures hit a low point in about 1988. They didn't begin to rise again until the mid 90's, when numbers increased quite dramatically -ironically around the time DVD was becoming popular. 

Looking at the global attendance figures, it seems a high point was reached in 2003, and things have been declining again since.&&For real, I don’t know why everyone’s acting like the distribution method is the only reason these movies aren’t getting nominated.&&Agreed.  They are being carried by their original shows at this point.&&[Let's take a tip from Mr Paul Anka](https://youtu.be/SlKao_Pox5A)&&Why do people watch professional basketball if they aren't NBA players themselves?

&&What's wrong with a trade show?&&I mean, why would they? Ther have an important role in todays society as an out of home activity. &&All the threats of past were different compared to Netflix. There never was a VHS company which had enough money to make a movie and release it solely on VHS. Netflix can do that. It has an altogether different business model. I don't mind if this results in the correctional behavior of movie theatres but releasing a good film solely on TV is irritating as a film fan.&&[Here's an article on what he said.](http://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/christopher-nolan-interview-dunkirk-netflix-1201857101/)

They have deep pockets and they care about the good stuff to spend enough money on it. Every second day now, I see a Netflix Original that I am too lazy to google about. Not to mention, these movies will result in a lot of profit.&&> Paramount and mother!

And Get Out.&&mother! Had Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Pfieffer, Domhnall Gleeson and was directed by Aronofsky.

Those four people connected to a movie lowers the risk a considerable amount&&Its more the ideas behind certain shows and the creative freedom they give their productions. Netflix also doesnt produce those movies themself. They buy them at movie festivals and then advertise them as originals. &&What would you nominate Meyerowitz for? Just curious. Haven't seen Mudbound yet.&&I liked the Meyerowitz Stories but chunks of it were a snooze. &&It was arguably good enough for a nomination, but I don't think it was good enough to win in any category for the year it came out.

For best picture, it would have been up against Spotlight, Fury Road and Big Short. No chance it wins even if it were nominated. 

I'd say Idris Elba would probably qualify as supporting actor. I'd have still given it to Mark Rylance from Bridge Of Spies, but Christian Bale and Mark Ruffalo in Big Short and Stallone in Creed were solid choices. Elba might possibly have had a better chance winning best actor because there was no clear front runner that year; I expect the academy still would have given it to Leo for The Revenant though.

The child actor was, in my opinion, better than Elba and was a more logical choice for lead actor nomination. He would have gotten no buzz and definitely wouldn't have won. &&Disagree - it was a good year with other great films nominated that were better. Carol wasn't even nominated that year and I thought that was a clear best pic nominee. BONN was good, but it wasn't great. I was not shocked when it wasn't nominated.
edit: I will say though that no Elba nomination was surprising.&&Lol&&It was good, but in the context of the competition... there were a lot of bloody great movies that year. Just unfortunate they came out in what was probably the best year for film in a while.&&if not for best Picture then best cinematography or technical Awards &&Meh. First half was good. Second half just sort of drifts and feels disjointed&&u/rickoryflowers&&/u/rickoryflowers&&[deleted]&&Didn't Netflix try to do something like that with Beast of no Nation and it pissed theaters off because they weren't going to make any money since you could watch it on Netflix? &&No, the Academy had guidelines that are easy to follow, Netflix is just stubborn or they don't care.&&Amazon and Netflix are not just moviemakers, like the Hollywood producers club. They are trying to change the dynamics of movie-viewing and the dynamics of buying and consuming movie entertainment with their models based on online streaming. The viewing of movies in theaters is something that doesn't fit in with this model. Why would Netflix and Amazon make a movie if they're not going to use the publicity and money accruing from it towards promotion of their own concept?
But on the other hand it's not clear what problems Hollywood has with Amazon and Netflix competing for the Oscars. What's so important about watching a movie in a theater? A likes that, goes to the theater. B doesn't, watches at home. What's the big deal with a theater? Why should they be placed squarely at the centre? I suspect there are other interests at work that aren't entirely clear. &&In France for example you have a forced delay of 36 month between theatrical release and VOD. I understand why Netflix can't afford to do a theatrical release there. The business is changing and so should the academy.&&But Beasts of No Nation *did* play in some theaters. I don’t know if it wasn’t eligible for other reasons, or they just didn’t include it; it did have a limited release though. &&Very, very few Netflix movies have played in any theater anywhere, and those that have have played on a minuscule number of screens,  with no theatrical exclusivity -- most in ways that wouldn't have qualified them for Oscars.

Amazon releases their films as major releases, in theaters all across the country, with a period of theatrical exclusivity.

Have you ever had the opportunity to see a Netflix movie in your local multiplex? I must have missed it.

Netflix is openly hostile to exhibitors, constantly talks shit about how Hollywood is over, buys festival-winning movies (like *I Don't Feel At Home in this World Anymore*) and then puts them on Netflix with no advertising, no fanfare -- they're not even on your homepage.

Like it or not, all of these things foster an adversarial relationship with people who vote on awards.

If Netflix would release at least *some* of their movies -- the major ones -- the same way Amazon does, there would be no problem.

I love Netflix. I embrace Netflix. 

But the reality is that if their inability to win awards is a problem, then Netflix is the cause of the problem, and they could solve it any time they wanted to.&&please, they do limited bullshit qualifying runs - not true theatrical runs.

There are some genuinely great content creators on Youtube and it would be nice for there to be a proper award ceremony for them.&&Or 4chan will end up making ""Pitbull's Alaskan Adventure"" the winner.&&Plus the internet would treat it like a joke like they do with every other online poll.&&And the Best Picture winner is ""Deadpool""!&&Nolan winning every year he has a movie, and probably every year in between.&&Critics can't be wrong in offering an opinion. Their job isn't to say whether or not a movie will be successful, it's to say what they thought of it.&&It won't make much of a difference for animation, since the Oscar voters already just pick whatever's the most popular, but yeah, it would suck for other categories.&&It's the same reason that something like rottentomatoes is shitty because it just aggregates everyone's opinion, and there's a large deviation between any user's personal taste and that mass averaging.

But there's nothing about internet reviews/awards that requires a mass electorate. Form a film society, heck form a multitude of niche film societies, and the members of those do the voting. It's basically what exists with the in-person film awards these days.&&Let's have Boxofficemojo awards.&&And the average person doesn't know much about movies and didn't watch movies that aren't blockbusters.&&What? You don't want it to be based on public vote so that all the nominees are just the top 7 films on the highest grossing of the year list? &&Movie McMovieface should finally get the critical acclaim and recognition that it rightfully deserves. &&> film experts, 

>not ones who work for Hollywood directly

If you're talking about critics, I can tell you, as someone who works in film, that most critics haven't the slightest clue how movies are made. It's incredibly frustrating to read all kinds misinformation from people who *should* know better, but don't.&&It's one of those comment that make sense intially, until you stop and think for a further two seconds and realise what a dumb idea it is.&&If any /r/TrueFilm users read that they'd get a heart attack. &&Sort of, but a films receipts are no sign of quality, and of course people pay before they watch... so you can pay for a movie and hate it.&&It might be a regional thing - or even a personal thing if they're calibrating my Netflix to my viewed data or whatever - but when Mudbound came out, I had to look for it under 'new arrivals - drama' and it was the last movie in the scroll. 

You'd think Netflix would promote its movies on its own site a little louder.&&Good points, but if the movie Netflix puts out is actually great the word will spread and it’s easy for Netflix to make it show up front and center for everyone. You don’t see Stranger Things and House of Cards getting lost through the cracks when everyone is talking about them and they take up half the screen when you open the Netflix app. &&Beasts of No Nation was getting talked about. And in terms of ""Oscar Buzz"" I think we all know popularity isn't what's getting these movies their awards. &&There’s a reason why too, Netflix is trying to have it both ways, they want their films to be Oscar eligible but they won’t sit at the table with exhibitors, their CEO comes out and talks about the decline of cinemas and how Netflix is the future. Whereas amazon has come at sat at the table with distributors and said “hey we think we have an original distribution model but we understand that theatrical exhibition has a place so we’ll play nice and show our movies in theaters for certain limited releases”

With digital now the barrier to entry is incredibly small to where even college filmmakers are getting their films in theaters at least locally since all it requires is a fairly standard formatting and a hard drive and can be sent to multiple locations. No more $2000+ 35mm prints of film or scanning of negatives, you can shoot 4 or 8k footage digitally, have a completely digital workflow and then master that out to a 2k or 4K dcp ready for theatrical distribution. 

Cinemas are actually moving more towards this alternative content movement and companies like amazon studios understand that and are getting their content on screen meanwhile Netflix takes a hardline stance that they believe cinemas are a dying breed but still want the awards that go with theatrical distribution of film. &&What Netflix movie are we saying is the big snub here? Everyone’s talking about eligibility but there’s no Netflix movie that stands out as one that absolutely positively should have been nominated at this point.&&change ""they aren't hyped on tv"" to ""they don't pay for tv ads"" and you're on the nail&&I mean, I watch NBA to see the best basketball players play. It's entertaining. I watch games, but I've never watched the ESPYs or anything.

If I was a huge movie fan, I would watch the movies that were the most interesting and entertaining to me. Of course I would probably watch the Oscars but that's not the main experience of the hobby - actually watching movies is.&&That's a weak analogy. A better one is why do people watch an award show where basketball all players give each other awards. 

I would watch the movie, but not the trade show.  I would watch the basketball game, but not the trade show &&In some categories at least. Look at last years best animation. Are you really telling me that 'zootopia' is better than ""Your name"", ""A silent voice"", ""The red turtle"", ""My life as a courgette"" etc? God no is it, but that category is always a hot mess. If you arent backed by a large american company you dont win it.&&I can't stand going out and even I still love going to the theaters in rare instances. 

It's probably more important now than its ever been in todays society, the only time I can think of it offering more value was during the depression when a cheap flick was the only thing an impoverished individual could spend his few dollars on to forget about his misery for an hour or two. 

Movies were highly important in those days, and today it's one of the few things that can get us out and together. &&Agreed. People are talking about movie theaters just in terms of movies, but theaters are selling an experience. It's good to get out of the house sometimes. Really, I think the poor economy is a bigger factor than Netflix in bad theater performance. Like, if streaming services suddenly disappeared, I don't think ticket sales would shoot up.&&Get out wasn't a huge risk for the studio. They released it in February and the budget was only 4 million. Granted, the movie was a surprise hit and paid off, but it wasn't necessarily a ""risk."" &&Have you seen this goddamn movie? It's probably one of the most audience alienating movies ever made and it has an F cinemascore. Star power doesn't matter that much anymore and besides Lawrence, none of those are huge names (Pfieffer was, not really anymore).&&Sandler. I'm not even kidding. Also, best original screenplay. &&Personally, I would nominate The Meyerowitz Stories right now for Picture, Director, Original Screenplay and Supporting Actor (Hoffman), with Sandler just missing for Actor. It was one of my favorite movies all year.

I would nominate Mudbound right now for Picture and Adapted Screenplay (just missing out for Supporting Actor for Mitchell and/or Hedlund)&&Welcome to half the Oscar nominated movies ever.&&Steve Carrell wasn’t even nominated and I thought he gave the best performance that year. 2015 was a strong year and Beasts didn’t have a chance. &&Honestly Carol was the bigger snub&&You don't believe Idris Elba deserved a nomination for his performance though?&&He made an account two years ago just to tell us this.&&But an all time low doesn't equate to irrelevant. If I make a million dollars a year, but last year I only made half a million, my earnings are at an all time low. This is not the same as being poor.

It's like, really easy to not say such clearly false things. Can it even be prove  that how much people care about the attendees is at an all time low? I don't think that it can.

Let's argue more meaningful stuff that can be verified instead of talking out of our asses because Dae hollywood elite?! &&Which would make the difference between putting it up at the same time, or putting it in the showroom first.&&Netflix put Beast of no Nation in 1 theatre in the U.S. so it would be considered for Oscars.&&I don't think they really cared about the theaters because it had simultaneous airing with Netflix at home. I think they only did it so it could be nominated for awards. &&Their movies are technically eligible. They gave Beasts of No Nation a limited theatrical release the same day they put it on Netflix, the academy just doesn't like that so they didn't nominate it.&&Aren't the academy rules somewhat arbitrary and rooted in tradition, like Tron not being eligible for best special effects since the use of computer graphics was considered 'cheating'?&&I’d go for don’t care. They make content, they get/maintain more viewers. They don’t get paid by the academy, they get paid by their subscribers.&&> Netflix is just stubborn or they don't care

Their whole business model with their Originals is that it's on demand streaming. Just like Blockbuster and Cable, the Oscars are stuck in the status quo while Netflix (and others) are leading the way with regards to media.

Personally I don't care much for award shows since they rely heavily on lobbying and political statements. I'd rather base my decision to watch a movie based on reviews &&Yep. Netflix is more like a TV channel than a cinema. If they don't release them in cinemas, their movies are legible for an Emmy!&&Well Amazon is happy with doing it the old way. They release most of their movies in theaters traditionally and then put them on Amazon prime around the time of the Blu-ray release.&&You’ve gotten some flack for this comment, but your pretty much spot on.  Netflix is actively disrupting the traditional theatrical window.  Compare that to Jeff Bezos, who releases films theatrically before moving it to Amazon and who genuinely seems to care about the filmmaking process. Reed Hastings only wants content, doesn’t care where it comes from, and only wants it to support his subscription service.  

If Netflix movies should get Oscars by debuting movies on their steaming service, then every TV and cable station should too.  &&Weird,  ""I don't feel at home in this world anymore"" was always on my home screen constantly. I ended up watching it last night. Great movie, I was not expecting the last 30 minutes at all. It kind of reminded me of the Big Lebowski. 

&&Maybe *we're* the ones with the problem, for acting as if awards matter.&&So I remember being able to watch Beasts of No Nation in my local theater? Yes, because it was released in San Francisco and I lived there. I understand it released online at the same time, but the post I replied to said it wasn't released in theaters. It was, so I was pointing that out.

Netflix would have released it to more theaters if they the large chains didn't  boycott it because it wasn't exclusive. I don't see why that should make it not worthy of Oscar considerations.&&The line is blending, for sure. There are lots of mini-series coming out that would work pretty well in theater format, like if they turned it into a weekly serial run, or even screened a 7-8hr binge with intermissions.

In any case, I think sort of the point of this thread is that the initial screening format is less and less relevant. A good drama is a good drama, whether it neatly fits into the eligibility criteria of the Academy (or the Emmy's) is not going to affect that, but it does affect the comprehensiveness (and thus legitimacy) of those awards.&&Why? What's the difference? 

Why should garbage movies like 'Jack & Jill' or 'Suicide Squad' be eligible, and not movies like Netflix's 'Beasts of No Nation'?

Quality should be the determining factor, not format. &&I could see it as a good fit.  Aladdin has some of the same type of madcap adventures like in snatch or lock, stock, and two smoking barrels.  Not to mention the sherlock movies were pretty successful and, imo, deservedly so.  I'd give it a chance before writing it off because of a couple bad movies. &&Oh. Guy that made Snatch and Revolver. 
Could be interesting. &&Because naturally a movie’s box office performance is all on the director...

Personally, I love Guy Ritchie’s style.&&They flopped but I thought the general consensus is that they were decent movies.

So, it's a marketing thing and is no fault of the director?&&Oye, mate, what the fook ya fink ya doin wif that monkay?&&Man from UNCLE was actually his best film in awhile and very enjoyable&&Many things go into selecting a director, and talent/ past success could be one of them. But, sometimes what matters is that they have worked well with particular executives or companies, they are consistent, and stay within budget. Heck, maybe somebody just likes him.

Just think about regular everyday things. The most qualified person on paper is not always the one that is hired to a particular position or accepted into some school. It does matter, but it can also be who you know and recommendations.&&Dats a mastapiece&&If they’re released theatrically they should be. If they’re not they shouldn’t be.

Wish I'd have kept one of them.&&Nah, then we'd be getting Minions instead of Inside Out, Secret Life of Pets instead of Zootopia, and Despicable Me 3 instead of Coco.

While it's true that voters often just seem to go with whatever their kids liked that year and that the category is extremely flawed for that reason, it's still certainly an improvement in that regard and they tend to award quality films. Plus, having the animation industry choose the nominations allows for stuff like Ghibli films, Laika films, and Anomalisa to get nomination recognition in the first place.&&Which is why Laika is still without an Oscar award, even after putting out Coraline, Paranorman, and Kubo and the Two Strings - which are some of the most intricate works of art I've ever seen &&Which is effectively the same thing as every game review website having a “game of the year”. Why should I trust your hypothetical film society’s opinion over anyone else? If you’re just taking a limited of number of “experts” opinions all you’ve done is recreate the Oscars without the history and with different eligibility rules. &&Marvel and Disney would sweep the awards. It would be no better than the Teen Choice Awards&&Aka the emoji movie &&I saw Mudbound pop up on there the other day and it was recommended. I'll probably watch it soon but it's literally right next to like four shows I'm watching and a slew of movies on my queue. You go to a movie theater and you have six choices of what to see maybe and there's a time limit aspect. You turn on Netflix and you have about 1,000 things to choose from and anything with Netflix's name on it will be on there forever. So already Mudbound is at the bottom of my list. In the last two weeks I've seen Disaster Artist, Lady Bird, Three Billboards, Florida Project, etc. These movies are gonna leave my local theater soon and they have great word of mouth. Mudbound is and always will be there for me to watch next time I'm just like meh put something on. &&TV shows are inherently different than movies. You can put hours into a TV show and keep up with them seasonally. That's why Netflix has only been able to bank on shows so far, movies are more quickly consumed therefore more quickly forgotten on a platform that relies on constant viewing.

Netflix is simply not the platform to rely on if you want to get awards buzz. Maybe in the long run they will change that but first they have to change how everyone watches new movies. &&You’re not wrong. Some would say Beasts of No Nation but I wouldn’t. They’ve yet to have anything phenomenal whereas Amazon has had a few hits.&&That's a fair point, but to many movie fans, the Oscars are the NBA Finals.

And of course lots of people follow Hollywood and Celebrity Culture as a hobby.&&How much of a risk was Wheelman? That was an example used, did that cost Netflix $100 million?&&Woah I’m not saying you’re wrong, but the reason it was made was most likely BECAUSE of the names attached to it. 

If some young hipster director came in with the same movie idea and 3 actors nobody cares about with meaningless credits I doubt this shit would be made at all. &&I would fucking love that if only because the next shitty cash-in he makes could be promoted as ""starring Oscar winner Adam Sandler"".

Not saying he's undeserving of the award.  Just amused by the idea of Adam Sandler being an Oscar winning actor.&&Honestly, not really. If anyone deserved a nomination, it was the starring child actor. I thought he was very good&&I didn't think so. He did the accent well, but other than that he was just being cocky. There wasn't really a moment that made me go ""Holy shit, that scene right there is Oscar worthy.""

The child deserved every nomination under the sun though. Especially at the end.&&So basically to win an award for making good movies they have to let OTHER PEOPLE profit off of their work.

Yeah. That's fucked up.  That's not an award you won. That's an award you bought.&&I think you mean one theatre chain. It was at all AMC theaters here in Austin.&&They were giving Okja a theatrical release so apparently they're trying it again this year.&&It also just wasn’t that great&&That was in the 70s. The Academy adjusts over time, and odds are they will again for streaming services, but it's going to take some time.&&I'd argue it means something. If Netflix had a movie that won Best Picture or something it would certainly bring a lot of attention. That's publicity and advertising and that equals subs.&&I'm sorry, I didn't have that information. That the policies of Amazon and Netflix are different. I'd say it's because Amazon wants to harness the power of movie theaters and the attendant experience in making a movie made by itself popular. Plus not putting off  Hollywood and the Academy.
&&I think you just accidentally sold me on a movie I'd been actively avoiding. &&Such a surprising and fantastic movie. The very last scene was great.... awh no, AH YES YOU GO ELIJAH&&They do matter. They may be superficial, but the fact is awards buzz is a large part of what makes The Revenant, La La Land, Gravity and many other films before them perform like a blockbuster. Quite often, it's the difference between relative prestige and relative obscurity. Even Moonlight would have more than likely done reasonably well considering it's miniscule budget, but Oscar buzz both pre and post-Best Picture win helped it hit 35 million and eventually over 50 million. That means something when it comes to the kind of films we get around this time of the year, and it means something to the careers of some fine directors. They're not perfect and they almost exclusively exist for the sake of business, but they do have clear, tangible benefits.&&It also matters in terms of getting talent to sign on to your films. A lot of established and rising talent won’t agree to do a movie where they can’t be considered for awards. Awards are a hugely important part of establishing careers in Hollywood. &&That's a deep THOT&&Well, yes, *Beasts* was the exception that proves the rule. 

Netflix specifically did a theatre run to qualify for the Academy Awards with that film; they don't with hardly any of their other titles.&&I would like to see Netflix movies go to the big screen. I enjoy the theatre experience. Giant screen, soda pop, the rumble of the sound. I get lost in movies.&&When I said Netflix needed to run start running its movies in theaters, I didn't mean to suggest they had never, ever done so. Sometimes it's okay to speak in generalities that paint a more accurate picture of the realities than hyper-literalisms would.

Obviously, here and there, they have experimented with theatrical releases in an extraordinarily insignificant way, where whatever they did release was unavailable to 99% of the population.

They have never given any of their movies a wide, theatrically-exclusive release. Or shown any signs that they care about the cinematic experience at all. Which is why Netflix was booed at Cannes. 

So again -- Netflix is the problem here. Netflix has pointlessly gone out of its way to create a hostile relationship with exhibitors and traditional Hollywood. The solution to this problem is entirely within their control.

If they want Oscars, they need to release their awards-hopeful films in the traditional way, and tone down the ""kill the father"" rhetoric.
&&It was eligible. It just wasn’t that good&&Movies play in the cinema. It's basically as simple as that.

Otherwise, shouldn't *Behind The Candelabra* have been eligible for Oscars? What about ""Ozymandias"" on *Breaking Bad*?

From a practicality stand point, the television academy and the film academy need ways to split up which projects fall under their purview. ""Played in a movie theatre"" is a pretty simple (and clear) way of doing so.&&Depends on the cinema and your home system. I don't really like the poor black level in cinemas compared to my OLED TV. Or the low resolution and lack of HDR (that should be fixed in 2018 as cinemas upgrade and there is not that many 4k/HDR content yet). And i don't like the smell of pop corn.&&Introducing the new troll package! Only $6.90 a week!&&What you did there, I saw it.&&I’m surprised there isn’t a service where you go through and rate a bunch of movies, and based on your ratings it gives you a list of closely matching critics.&&Kubo was great to look at, but its plot was mediocre at best&&*Spirited Away* and *Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit* both won Best Animated Feature, so it's not 100% a popularity contest.&&I think that's the point, you have lots of societies catering to all kinds of niches and sets of tastes. You can see what films they've awarded in the past, and find one that suits your tastes.

It's absolutely no different than today's film societies. To that point, I think your question is just as applicable - why do you subscribe to the Academy's award choices over anyone else? Personally they've chosen plenty of clunkers and undeserving winners, and I don't regard their opinion as very relevant to my taste in movies.&&So Disney would sweep the awards?&&I wonder if movie theatre attendance is on the decline now that there are so many on demand options. Of course you still need to go to theaters to see new releases, but personally I don’t mind waiting a couple months to watch a movie and like the convenience and frugality of watching them at home. Maybe we’ll see a shift in that direction. &&[deleted]&&the Oscars wouldn't be the NBA finals so much as the NBA awards: http://www.nba.com/NBAawards#/&&It wasn't one, but that has nothing to do with the point I'm making. The only argument I have is that Get Out wasn't a risk for Paramount. I'm not saying that Paramount doesn't take risks, or that everything Netflix produces is putting it's studio on the line.&&However, there is something to be said about how the movie experience is different from theater to living room.

For example, almost everyone I know that hated Cloverfield watched it in their living room, those that loved it saw it in the theaters. You need that big screen, booming sound, and socially forced abstention from other devices to truly experience some movies.&&Just to play devil's advocate, I imagine part of the reasoning is your movie has to be widely released in theaters. For example, independents are recognized as a separate category. If its an online only film and never has to be released in a theater, how is what netflix does significantly different than someone making a 2 hour movie and posting it on vimeo? or youtube?&&> That's an award you bought.

That's the Oscars. You have to play their game and campaign the fuck out of your movie.&&Wait, do you know how and why the Academy Awards were started? The studios wanted to create prestige for their products. Same reason why stars like Cary Grant, who refused to play the studio system, never won an Oscar. Hitchcock also suffered the same fate (only Oscar he won was honorary).

It’s literally always been about selling more movie tickets. It’s just been around long enough for people to forget and assume otherwise.&&The entire awards system is fucked up. They are thinly veiled ""who throws the most extravegant party"" awards, not awards for outstanding technical accomplishment or outstanding accomplishment in the literary arts (I do consider movies to be part of the literary arts as they do contain large amounts of writing via scripts).

An unfortunate truth that is easily remedied. To fix it all you need to do is take a leap occasionally. Maybe you pass by a movie poster with some unknown to you actors in it so you say ""why the fuck not"" and you get yourself a ticket to see for yourself if it is worthy of your award of approval. Sure the award may not be as prestigious as an academy award, but it is the audience approval that good directors and content creators truly desire. 

It is that feeling of knowing somewhere, somehow your creation managed to tap into that viceral language of the heart. That feeling that somewhere out there someone understood the message you wanted to convey, that somewhere out there exists people who work on the same wavelength as you. It is a feeling that you just can't shake no matter how long you have been at it or how many denials you throw when someone compliments your work. Deep down inside under those words of self degradation there is a heart that is swelling to the point of bursting and a spirit that will not let good enough be the end of it.&&Also that's apart of the American machine. If netflix wants to be recognized for ther awards, they should be by their rules. Just because they have a lot of money and clout, doesn't mean they should bypass every institution to get what they want.  That's dangerous.


The movie industry supplies people jobs. Jobs that has some interest to them. We focus on celebrity, but there's a world around it that's just as real. &&It has never been about awards.  These shows are about drumming up support for the industry and congratulating themselves.&&That's how the Oscars have always been. It is about which distributor/production house puts more money behind a film during the campaign. That's how films like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and The Reader secured nominations despite mixed responses from critics. Hell, Crash won Best Picture simply because more money was put into its campaign than into Brokeback Mountain.&&[deleted]&&That's the Oscars.&&I believe The Meyerowitz Stories got a limited theatrical release too.&&Been meaning to watch that, how was it?&&Regardless of your opinion it was nominated at several other awards shows. Particularly Idris Elba's performance. If it had been released by a normal studio it would have gotten Oscar nominations. &&Yeah, it was basically meh Oscar bait.&&That's my point. OP said the rules are simple, implying that Netflix shouldn't complain. I say the rules are (and have always been) somewhat arbitrary to begin with.&&Tron came out in 82 though.&&Attention?

Is there anyone left that is not aware of Netflix?&&Why work with the entertainment industry when you can work outside it and give the whole system a giant middle finger. 

Most of the entertainment awards are just popularity contests anyways. Netflix and Amazon don't need popular opinion on their side, they have money. They can outright buy film rights and make their own stuff that no one is voting on and expose the rampant corrupt stupidity. I personally don't want them to court award committees. They should spend their money funding good filmmakers and buying film rights. Eventually no one will give a shit about Oscars and Academy Awards or they will adapt the process of their own volition to include Netflix and Amazon to keep from becoming irrelevant. I would respect them a hell of a lot more.

Basically they should make their own awards with blackjack and hookers. &&I thought it looked stupid, but I was pleasantly surprised.&&But buzz doesn't mean that much to Netflix. They aren't after box office receipts. They are after subscription maintenance. &&>Movies play in the cinema. It's basically as simple as that.

Yeah, except for the ones that don't, which is my point. These delineations may have made sense 40 years ago when the *only* way to see movies was in the cinema. These days those borders barely exist anymore. 

>shouldn't *Behind The Candelabra* have been eligible for Oscars?

I haven't seen it, but yes, it should have been. *The Sunset Limited* is another HBO movie which should have been eligible -- and which would have had a real shot at winning a number of awards, because it's a fantastic film.

>What about ""Ozymandias"" on *Breaking Bad*?

That's not a movie.
&&> Movies play in the cinema. It's basically as simple as that.

That's just factually wrong. A ton of movies never play in a cinema. Indies are still movies, direct to DVD films are still films.

The classification of ""a movie"" is not, at all, exclusively ""plays in theaters in a wide release.""&&That is the most arbitrary shit I have ever heard.&&And I don't like other people using their mobile phone while I am trying to enjoy the movie&&It's a tautalogical joke. A home theater might provide a better viewing experience but by definition, since it's not a cinema, it couldn't be a better cinematic experience. &&This is a brilliant idea &&It has been for a long time. &&That's a big part of it. A trip to the movie theater can get pretty pricey. One month of Netflix costs as much as a single ticket at most movie theaters, that doesn't even get into snack purchases.&&Ok! And some people like it!&&Part of that could also be that the people who choose to go see it in the theaters are those more likely to like such a movie in the first place. Also, that they were more invested in the movie and thus, consciously or not, more likely to have a positive opinion of it to justify the cost. &&Oh agreed. There are movies you just want to see on the big screen.  Great example : I'm like 1 of 12 people alive who didn't see Avatar. Knowing how Hollywood loves cashing in, I'm banking on it being on the big screen before the 2nd one premieres.  I'll watch it for the first time that way. &&Amazon intentionally releases movies to theaters because it’s a different experience for sure. Manchester By the Sea and The Salesman both won Oscars last year for Amazon Studios. 

They are different to Netflix in this regard (showing in theaters) and are the first “new breed” of studio to win any Oscars. 

Edit: Amazon Studios won THREE Oscars, not two: one for The Salesman and two for Manchester by the Sea (best actor and best original screenplay). &&Perhaps that's true for some movies, but personally I feel the best experience for movie's like Cloverfield come from watching it alone at home, where no one disturbs you for the length of the movie with silly questions about what's happening in the movie cause the were not paying attention or giving a running commentary about what they like and don't like in the movie.

Edit: at lot of people are confusing me talking about people disturbing you part as people disturbing you in a theatre, what I am actually talking about is people disturbing your movie experience at ""HOME"" and why it would be better to watch certain movies alone at home.&&Saw Cloverfield opening day. I hated it &&all movies&&The same went for Gravity for me so i totally understand &&Your point is valid and i would agree that its not different - however i think a youtube movie should also be considered for oscars. Every movie should actually. I mean why not? If your award has the title best picture for example why would it make a difference where it was shown? If the movie got recognition and critics good enough to consider it i dont think that it makes any difference if it was shoen in theatre or not. I cant imagine a single argument why not right now.&&If someone made a movie on YouTube that got as many views as Netflix movies and was quality, it DOES deserve an Oscar consideration, imo.  Just because they have their heads up their asses about new technology doesn't make a movie not a movie.&&Most awards only exist to support the industry they're in. Who would run and sponsor an award that didn't make money?

Musicals, plays, novels, poems, albums, video games etc. - they all have strict stipulations about what can enter them. They don't want some idiot without an agent, or a production team, or the ability to sell or market their work to win.

And frankly, neither do artists. They need prestigious prizes in order to get recognition and money. And unless it's the Nobel prize - it's not going to exist unless it makes money.&&Things can evolve from where they start.  Especially if they have been around long enough that people forget their origins.  If they want to stay relevant (possibly moot at this point, losing battle) they need to wise up.&&Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close ... something about that movie bothered me without even seeing it.  Same as with the show ""This is Us"".

Netflix TV Shows get taken seriously, and a lot of that is from the awards they get at the Emmy's/ Golden Globes.

Netflix movies on the other hand, are considered secondhand despite being just as high-quality.&&> Most of the entertainment awards are just popularity contests anyways. 

While there are a lot of gripes you can have about the awards circuit... this isn’t one. 

It’s a lot more of a self congratulatory elitist circlejerk than anything else. 

Also don’t you think it would be bad for two mega corporations to buy out all of the best directors??&&Warner Bros doesn't need popular opinion, they have money too.

Don't be silly, the Oscars are a big deal and Amazon and Netflix would love to be a part of it. Netflix isn't in business to disrupt or expose anything. They're in business to make money. Winning one of the headline awards loke Best Picture would drive scores of new subscribers.


Also, don't forget the Oscars are still going to be a big deal to those good filmmakers you mention and the people in the films as well. I'm sure they would rather be included.&&Seems like those two trends should perform similarly, no? If a good movie is likely to get you out of your home and into the cinema, it'd probably also incentivize you to subscribe to netflix, especially if you keep seeing good movies come out of netflix.&&That's fine, but then they can't complain about awards.&&Buzz is marketing... Drives sales/subscribers. &&Why would buzz translate to box office but not new subscriptions??&&Behind The Candelabra was an ""HBO Film"" (their in-house branding for their TV movies) that played only on TV. It won eleven Primetime Emmy Awards, because it played only on TV. It wasn't eligible for and Academy Award, because it played only on TV.

It makes perfect sense for AMPAS to have a rule that decides which projects fall under their purview, and if Netflix (or anybody) wants to compete for an award from AMPAS, it's perfectly reasonable that they should have to meet their criteria.&&> That's not a movie.

What is a movie then? How is a 74 minute last episode of a Game of Thrones season different from one of the Hunger Games movies? Both feature length features of a multi-issue narrative.&&Independent movies do play in cinemas, and usually have their own category, and make the independent film circuit.

Now, the independent film circuit banning Netflix and Amazon, thats a different f'd up topic. But if it plays in an film festival or has a limited release, that counts as a theatrical release&&First of all this is pretty clearly a conversation about what distinguishes a movie from a television show in the eyes of AMPAS--which, yes actually, *is* whether or not it plays in a cinema.

And second of all, I didn't say anything about wide release, and neither do the Oscar rules. Direct to DVD films are not eligible for the Oscars because, of course, they go directly to DVD. And as DVDs go extinct, they often go directly to streaming services like Amazon and Netflix, which... Well it's exactly what everybody is already talking about, but thanks for bringing it up.&&The rules for qualifying for Oscar consideration are like.. the most basic, lowest possible bar. They aren't arbitrary, they are common sense.

And besides, the Oscars are administered by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. If Netflix doesn't want to play by their rules, they can try to win a BAFTA or a Cesar or a Golden Globe instead; or they could invent their own award, and give them all to themselves, because then *they'd* be in charge of determining who qualifies. 

The right to compete for an Oscar isn't enshrined in the constitution, it's determined by the organization that awards the prize (not unlike every other award in the history of awards).&&The definition is not arbitrary, its literally the definition. Where one consumes media happens to be arbitrary these days.

Movies play in theaters, TV shows on TV. Netflix and Amazon are watched primarily on TVs and mobile devices.

There are movies that are made for TV. There are TV episodes/events that are 90min-120min, that are just as long as a movie. There are TV shows where each episode is broken up into a self contained narrative. There are movies where each film is part of a large arc. 

The way to differentiate TV and movie awards is by where they are shown. When Amazon and Netflix starts doing theatrical releases, then they can win Oscars. Or perhaps, Oscars should make a category for best online film.

Otherwise, could a TV movie win an oscar? what about a twilight zone episode as a ""short film""? Can Avengers or Ironman win an Emmy for best miniseries, competing with Band of Brothers?&&Only problem is that it's a one-use thing. No real chance of profiting off of it.&&Watched Avatar on the big screen twice. Once in 3D. It was worth it. &&Amazing 3d movie. Really well done look and feel wise.&&[removed]&&Avatar in 3D was an experience that hasnt been matched since in my opinion. &&Looks like 50% of us are in this thread now.&&I've never seen Avatar either. You're genuinely the first person I've ever come across who's in the same boat. Good to know I'm not the only one. &&Manchester By the Sea is great even on a laptop but damn I wish I could have seen it on the big screen.&&[deleted]&&Go to the cinema alone. Truely one of life's greatest pleasures once you get over the social stigma. &&The reason they are separate is because the Oscars, by definition, is for theatrically released films. The Emmys are for television. Golden Globes is for film and television. The argument against recognizing a youtube movie or Netflix movie is that it is not a theatrical film, which is what the Oscars specifically recognize. 

Youtube, Netflix, Amazon etc do not fit neatly into any of the boxes. Maybe they need their own award, or award category, or find a better definition. But you can't make the definition too broad. &&To satisfy the rules of The Oscars and be considered eligible, it needs to run in a theater in LA for atleast a week.  It’s the rules.  They need to have atleast some sort of standard or pretty soon TV shows and miniseries are going to try and submit.  There was a little bit of pushback about OJ: Made In America winning best documentary last year because it was originally made for TV and had 5 episodes.  There has to be a line somewhere and this one is very specific and makes sense.&&The counter argument is that there is no actual need for ONE award covering ALL media.
The way filming a broadway show shouldn't automatically mean it's now a movie, technically, so it should get an Oscar AND an Emmy on top of the Tony.

It only is a problem if you assume that the Oscars HAVE to cover everything that is a feature or short-film.

The reason why the Oscars still have a higher standing is that on the big screen some more attention has to be paid over a tv screen, still, even if the quality of personally owned TV's has caught up significantly over time. Including everything for any device doesn't make those films ""better"" than before, it just means the difference between the Oscars and every other award goes away.&&In all honesty...why?  It's not like movies released for TV first are up for Oscars; they go up for Emmys.  The requirement that it be in theaters for a time weeds out TV movies and direct to video stuff, even if they happen to be good (and especially for things like make-up or costume design, they could be), partly because there's an entire separate awards show.&&a) how do you determine its quality without watching it? Is there someone at the academy that will have to screen every amateur youtube movie?
b) how do you know the views are real? Also, the views are free. The threshold to watch the movie is zero.&&They've been screening that movie like crazy around LA the last couple of months.  I think they will definitely push that for their Oscar contender this year.

The thing I don't get is why they are being so stubborn.  They don't want to play by the rules and still want to be invited to all of the big festivals and awards shows.  

The Academy only requires a one week run in either New York or LA at a *minimum* for Oscar eligibility.  I highly doubt sending a hard drive to half a dozen cinemas in town is going to cost them all that much.  

The Academy has the requirements so reasonable so the small players can still be eligible.  Netflix and Amazon are both playing with major studio money right now with their budgets so there is no reason they can't screen their movies for one damn week in NY/LA and *then* release it to their platform.  

&&Is definitely getting a qualifying run. As did Okja and I assume that Angelina Jolie one would have as well if they felt strongly about its potential. &&Et tu, Dustin? &&I mean, he won the SAG and was nominated at BAFTA and the Golden Globes. Sure people have been snubbed with all of those before but it's unlikely. He's an overdue actor, if a normal studio released that movie he would have been in. &&Am i the only one who hasnt seen a netflix movie be the same quality then? What are those movies? All the movies ive seen on netflix have been subpar or you can see they where budget films. (Nothing against that, they can still be enjoyable) i just havent seen a netflix movie that is the same quality as hollywood.&&> Netflix movies on the other hand, are considered secondhand despite being just as high-quality.

Well, that's because they are.  
Netflix has been doing pretty well with shows but they still gotta figure out their movie division&&> Netflix TV Shows get taken seriously, and a lot of that is from the awards they get at the Emmy's/ Golden Globes. 

Maybe in some circles, but from what I've seen people don't really care about awards. In my eyes the award shows are the ones that need to prove their legitimacy nowadays, as they get harder and harder to take seriously.&&Not when it’s a mega corporation they like 🙄&&
>Also, don't forget the Oscars are still going to be a big deal to those good filmmakers you mention and the people in the films as well. I'm sure they would rather be included. 


This was the point I was going to make, including a step further- I'd bet my bottom dollar that the people at Netflix and Amazon also love filmmaking. I mean, who doesn't, but what I mean to say is it's likely they *really* enjoy it all. Maybe not the top execs but definitely the people in the trenches like those who curate the selection; scouts who dig through mountains of scripts and projects to find the diamonds worthy of polish; the people who then green light those finds; all the assistants, secretaries, go-fors etc. in between.

These people went into the film industry for a reason and no matter that they ended up at Netflix or Amazon (or their subs), an Oscar is an affirmation of that passion for the profession and always has been.
&&And I'm saying whether it played in the cinema or on TV is a pointless distinction.

If it's a movie, it should be eligible.
&&One is a self-contained story and the other is not.&&>Otherwise, could a TV movie win an oscar?

Yes, the entire point of this debate is that they should be able to.

An HBO film like The Sunset Limited absolutely should have been able to compete with the theatrical releases that year. 

>There are TV episodes/events that are 90min-120min, that are just as long as a movie.

But no one would confuse them for a movie. A TV movie is literally just a movie that aired on TV. They are indistinguishable from theatrical release movies. Whereas 90 minute TV episodes are distinguishable.&&>Movies play in theaters, TV shows on TV [...] There are movies that are made for TV

I see. &&I had the pleasure of watching it in Imax 3D. Only 3D movie that was worth watching.

Ever since then I felt sad watching any other 3D movie. Simply couldn't compare. &&Me too but on mushrooms. 3D + mushrooms was much better than 2D and no mushrooms.&&Saw it 3 times with different groups of people in 3D. Would’ve seen it a fourth time if there was someone who’d have me. Nowhere near the same at home, even with a 3D TV&&I’ve seen Avatar and Gravity in (true) IMAX 3D. Both were very worth it. I otherwise avoid 3D screenings like the plague. 

&&While it was impressive, it still fell into some traps of applying conventional film making methods where they do not apply well.

It specifically used focus to ""catch the eye"" but put moving things in the background. In 2D this is a completely accepted and functioning method to pull the viewer towards the faces in a dialog for instance. You just go with the flow and look where the picture is sharp.

In 3D the movement catches your eye, and because it is out of focus, you eye wants to adapt, but can't (because it is not out of focus because it is actually deeper or closer, but because it is made artificially so).

It got annoying fast, and using this is part of why sensitive people get headaches without even realising that this is part of the problem.

The better solution is the one many CGI movies used (except Pixar in UP for instance, they had ideas about being cinematic without realising what they were doing ""wrong""), namely giving the viewer ""super-vision"" and EVERYTHING being in focus regardless of the distance and using OTHER methods for catching the eye, but not punishing wandering.

This also is part of the ""why assholes ruined 3D movies for everyone"" problem. People who don't understand that they have to rethink ""best practices"" but are forced to cash in on the boom.&&[removed]&&[removed]&&Life of Pi emerged as a critical and commercial success, earning over US$609 million worldwide.&&Are you saying it wasn't deserving of a cinematography award?&&r/theydidthecounting

I get those rules in the 90s, but today... they don't make a lot of sense anymore.  

Also, I thought Emmys were for tv shows, not movies?&&That's because movies released for TV were originally the ones that failed to get wide release, as printing reels and physically shipping them to hundreds of theatres was cost prohibitive, but making one copy for each channel wasn't, especially when there were so few channels.

Nowadays made-for-tv movies are just that, MADE for television.  They aren't of the same caliber, and know it.  Movies made for netflix can and often have eclipsed Hollywood's quality.  If Hallmark starts doing that, I'll say Hallmark deserves oscar consideration.&&There's this thing that happens, it's called word of mouth.  Do these people exist in a vacuum?  No?  Then that should suffice.

Edit : to back this up, I cottoned on to the power of word of mouth when at like 3pm on the day it was released I found this new show, Stranger Things.  By the time everyone got home at 5pm, I had seen a lot of people talking about it online, and both people I lived with had heard about it at work.  Presuming it landed at midnight, and it either rolls that out over timezones or launches at west coast midnight, that was maximum 17 hours of existence before word of mouth had gotten it to multiple people in my household, across generational gaps.&&>The Academy only requires a one week run in either New York or LA at a *minimum* for Oscar eligibility.  I highly doubt sending a hard drive to half a dozen cinemas in town is going to cost them all that much.  

It's not that simple.

I unfortunately was scheduled for my shift at Jiimmy Johns during the marathon. Like any responsible teen, I called in sick and went to the marathon. Now the manager that I called into didn't like me very much (which was fair, I was a terrible employee) and was immediately suspicious. He knew I was lying. After all the movies my friend and I were leaving the theatre and he realized he forgot his phone, so we turned around to head back in and find it. A large hand was put on my chest in the front entry way of the theatre and stopped me in my tracks. I looked up to see a man in an Iron Man mask. He lifted up the mask and dramatically revealed that he was the manager who I had called in sick to.

It’s the only movie coming out in the near future that I can see having a chance of beating The Force Awakens opening weekend record. &&It's like Mickey Mouse just said, ""Fine, I'll do this myself""&&For real, Marvel has been completely knocking it out of the park. The constant stream of quality hits can’t last forever but I doubt it’ll be either Black Panther or Infinity War or even Ant-Man and the Wasp that breaks the streak. &&The story of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet will span over two films, but it's not a 2 parter.

Originally it was Infinity War Part 1 and Part 2, but now it's just Infinity War, and then Avengers 4 will be the part 2, but with a different title.&&Unlike DC that just went right to the big stuff hoping to catch up and only keeping 1-2 directors with the universe when Marvel has different directors for most of their movies.&&I’m sure they’ve at least learned from Age of Ultron which, while okay, wasn’t near as epic as it should have been.

Actual excerpt

^^^not ^^^really&&Hmmm I have heard about this, on how RDJ's demand for his pay is so much, that they have problems having him into the movie.

But I never understand why or what the problem is, do you mind telling me the story behind it and RDJ's reasons?&&> His paycheck is so large that they actually tried to do Civil War without him.

Because ***Civil War*** was out of contract and had to be negotiated separately (same for ***Homecoming***). But ***Infinity War*** is his final contracted appearance so his paycheck will be more like the other Avengers films. Still bigger than everyone else, but without the bonuses for hitting certain grosses. 

&&It was either that or rename the film: Robert Downey Jr and The Avengers. &&Wrong Infinity Event. Look at [this](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet_Vol_1_6) cast list.&&I thought Dinklage was rumored to be playing Pip?&&I know some of those names&&Star Fox is in this??! What about Slippy??&&Yeah... definitely a ""few"" &&I had to google a few of those to make sure you weren't making them up&&Bear down for Infinity War.&&I just realised Troy and Abed are part of the MCU.&&Ken Jeong plz&&Featuring Neil Patrick Harris as Doctor Horrible. &&There better be a stair car and hopefully a banana stand too&&Cool cool cool. &&[Yep.](https://youtu.be/xECUrlnXCqk)&&Same for the UK!

Edit: We get it on April 25th!&&Look at every blockbuster released in the beginning of May. It’s always marvel. Guardians had it this year. Civil war last year. Ultron in 2015&&Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2., and now Infinity War all released that first weekend of May. That's just the big ""money"" weekend for blockbusters because it's the beginning of the summer season. It's not so much about sentimentality of the 10 year anniversary as much as it is capitalizing on that first weekend of May. &&Holy shit this has been going on for a decade &&omae wa mou shindeiru&&F&&Hmm, I don't have any respects. How much is that in freedom bucks?&&Its Treason, then&&GODS I WAS ON THE WRONG SUB THEN. &&And then he died. That's the end of the story. The guy died like a week or two later. He really did know his time was coming and Disney legit gave a human being one of his final wishes on planet earth. It was a beautiful and unbelievably sad moment all wrapped in one. &&This is almost the plot of ""Fanboys."" A group of friends try to break into Skywalker Ranch to steal a copy of ""The Phantom Menace"" because one of them is dying of cancer.&&This is what you might think...but force awakens ends on a massive cliffhanger. 

That guy went to his grave never knowing what Luke was about to say to Rey.&&But if you get resurrected you instantly smell good. &&I mean, it was a hell of a lot better than BVS. I will admit, though, that I mostly liked it because ""Oh, they said/did the thing!"" and I had a good time. It's still not a great movie, but it's not anywhere near that bad. &&I’m sorry for your loss.&&What's up?&&He already said he would have bigger things to worry about in hell.&&All my friends are memers, take it slow&&I didn’t think anything would ever get me to repent.

But here we are...&&Batman vs Superman at night, so that you have to go to sleep to the scream of ""MARTHA! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME! MARTHA! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME! MARTHA!""&&> In a century, there will be Star Wars Episode 22, but we'll both be dead and missing out on a new lead character that's half Asian and Russian. Her name? Yvonne Puteshnzky. Her goal? ~~Blow up death star v250.89~~ Capture the Loch Ness Monster and claim the reward of all the riches in Scotland.

&&[removed]&&It's a sequel to Infinity War, but not a continuation of the story presented in that movie. The next Spider-Man movie picks up, literally, minutes after Avengers 4 ends.&&Oh shit you were being serious&&It's actually recursive. You have to really zoom in.&&AAAAAAAAA&&comic sans...

but its a comic book movie...

SO TORN&&you fucker&&Well I [made one](https://i.imgur.com/d0oeL6G.jpg) without the offensive Comic Sans. Feel free to use it on your phone!&&It might soon enough. Don’t give up hope

Excuse me while I go get my walker.&&Me too! My birthday is May 2 and I'll never forget the Lizzie McGuire Movie released on my birthday. &&hoping they do a separate poster for each main person that together make a bigger image of Thanos or something &&I wouldn't say you can 'clearly"" see him. He's basically a silhouette. But yeah, he wasn't really a huge surprise, but they were kinda teasing him a lot in the marketing.&&Everyone knew he was in the movie, but very little was shown of him prior to the release.&&Yeah, don't think that's going to be a problem once Thanos rips the Stone from his forehead...&&Take him out on a date, and then ask for it.&&The leaked trailer shows him sitting behind some railings that conveniently hide his forehead, and he looks sad. I get the feeling he'll survive but will be reduced to an angsty wreck.&&Jesus, calm down. Didn’t put two and two together... Thanks Marvel expert!&&We don't know that ripping the mind stone out of Vision will kill him. As far as I'm aware, there's nothing indicating Ultron didn't just add it to the body because he thought it would make him more powerful. Ultron's intended final form was supposed to be a perfect evolution of man and machine. Presumably he would have had an internal or emergency power supply, assuming the mind stone powers him rather than just giving him more abilities.&&there isn't even any video, just four hours of an answering machine playing with tony getting progressively drunker and random other characters showing up to talk to him as he makes the calls. 

""Hey Cap, or is it nomad now? I don't care. Anyway, just calling to let you know the team is doing great. Never better, in fact. Much fewer civilian casualties these days. We don't really get called out too much. But hey, at least we haven't cause an international incident!"" -Pepper Potts enters the room but is unheard- ""No I am not calling him again... Somebody else... Don't touch that!"" -sounds of a scuffle, followed by glass breaking.- ""I hope you're happy. That was thirteen hundred dollar scotch... I do not spend too much on liquor... You spend more on the crappy art you fill this house with than I have ever spent on liquor... I didn't say you have crappy taste... no I didn't... Damn it."" -Voicemail ends abruptly. &&'Steve you said to call if I ever need you. Really need you and I do. I need you. I need Captain America. I can't do this without you. (RDJ sincerity, looks straight through the camera) Maybe I can't do anything without you. (Sincere pause) Maybe without you I'm nothing. Maybe YOU saved ME. (Breath) Maybe you did but I need you now more than ever, more than Loki. More than Ultron.  More than even your little red head and I'm not talking about Widow here. I need you for the big one. I NEED you. I can't do this without you buddy. (Pause) I need you to pick up some ice (Avengers erupt in drunken cheering in the background) Yeah I heard you're the ice man so if you can make it pass the cops hunting you I need you to make my martini less dry.' &&""I'll just be here with Emma Peel.""

""I'm Black Widow!""&&>dont ruin ~~the fun~~

the carefully stage managed viral marketing campaign &&Holland (so you don't get confused with Tom Sawyer or ex-Blink 182 member Tom Delonge), has kinda played faux fast and lose since being cast. He seems to know his limits like Ruffalo of what he can share.&&Well, he Facebook Live’d the Ragnarök premiere, and he also Facebook Live’d the 10th anniversary photo shoot.&&Easily in the top 3 MCU movies to date.&&Get the fuck out of wherever you are right now and go see it!&&There&&I can sleep well now.&&""Hey uh.. can you put a couple more sources of light and conflicting shadows in this?

I watched the teaser and managed not to watch the trailer but Disney thought different.&&Patton Oswalt will be thrilled!&&I trust Ron Howard will get it out for May. I was just discussing with s friend that maybe,possibly, they are setting it up so that they,Disney, are returning the franchise to the summer blockbuster slot so that episode 9 will be released for May of 2019 and end the saga on the day it started. Just a wild guess obviously but one I'd like to see. &&Don't forget your 3D glasses!&&70mm vinyl original Japanese print&&Pay $40 to unlock full sequel&&I was actually surprised at how much RDJ was shown in Spider-Man homecoming but I guess it makes sense since Tom Holland isn't a super well known actor. Leaving more room for billable bigger name screen time&&Masi Oka? &&He got out of contract and he was so required for the upcoming marvel lineup that he used his leverage to get whatever he wanted.  Basically, he realized that he had all the power in the situation and they couldn't do anything but agree.  
  
Ryan Reynolds did the same thing with his Deadpool 2 negotiations.  &&Downey Jr.'s the only regular MCU star still around who signed on before they knew how big Iron Man 1 would be. His stalling career in the mid-2000's and drug addict past meant Marvel low-balled him on upfront cash and gave him a cut of box office instead, which turned out to be incredibly lucrative, so ever since then he's been able to raise his cut of the box office on these increasingly huge movies on every renegotiation. Edward Norton would've potentially had similar power if he'd stuck in the Hulk role and been beloved. Meanwhile, Terrance Howard was replaced by Don Cheadle because he had the biggest (upfront) paycheck of the Iron Man 1 cast (coming off Hustle & Flow) and demanded a proportional raise to Downey Jr. (meaning he'd still get more money than Downey Jr.) for Iron Man 2.

Civil War was, ironically, a breaking point in a pseudo-Civil War within Marvel, where MCU producer Kevin Feige had to get approvals from Marvel's Chairman Ike Perlmutter, who's infamously frugal and old-fashioned and toy-driven. Perlmutter demanded they figure out a way to do Cap 3 without Iron Man/Downey Jr., who wanted to work with the Russos. Disney sided with Feige, and then moved Marvel Studios out from under Perlmutter.&&Sure.

RDJ plays Iron Man, a fan favorite who launched the entire cinematic universe. As such, he can demand a high paycheck for appearing in the film.

Disney does not want to pay him this much, therefore it's a problem.

Better?&&In addition to reasons stated by others he appears as Iron Man so much that it takes up a ton of his schedule and doesn't allow him to appear in many other movies. Part of his pay is compensation for that.&&RDJ also negotiated to have his costars get more equal pay. He didn’t feel right that he made so much more than them. So he negotiated to have it equalized. &&RDJ's Iron Man was a gamble and they didn't think the MCU would be running for over a decade so his contract didn't include a dozen movies. Once he got out he got hela expensive (pun intended).

RDJ actually offered to take a pay cut in exchange of more screen time for Civil War.&&I think he's like the only one who is able to ask for a % of the gross of the movies, and they give it to him because they got no choice, because everyone knows % of net is a scam in Hollywood.&&Fox McCloud and the gang is in there too!?&&Starfox? DO A BARREL ROLL!&&How are they gonna do it without my man Norrin Radd?

I swear, the people who made that ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" movie should be in jail. Such a waste of the best character.&&Oh don't tell me you're unfamiliar with Rusty Nales! We got a filthy casual over here!&&He didn't make the cut.&&Infinity War is going to be streets ahead, buddy!&&And the dean. &&Im kinda hoping for Winger.  &&Nope, only the KFC space simulator.&&April 25th for UK, day before my birthday.

(The gauntlet actually is left handed, so we can't rule this out.)&&I’m pretty sure the stone is literally his power source and Stark can’t really create something that can compete with that. They shoot a lot of scenes to throw people off. &&It’s my understanding that the mind stone literally makes him conscious and self aware.

I didn't know about Terrance Howard wanting a proportional raise. That's crazy. No way was he important enough to the movie to be worth that at all.

They lowballed everybody. For example Scarlett Johansson had to sign on for a 9-movie deal for a very low amount. And they almost lost Mickey Rourke on Iron Man 2 (this is when he was hot from The Wrestler) by offering him sub-250k I believe.&&I understand this completely. And RDJ *deserves* it. 

I will say that it consistently blows my mind that an actor can be so good and appear to have so much fun that he wouldn’t just do it for a standard rate. 

Edit: good points being made below. To be clear; I fully grasp the facts of the situation. I just can’t fathom the difference between asking for 20mil, 35mil or 50mil - to me it’s the same amount. &&They had *eveyone* in there.&&Thanos: ""Can't let you do that Star Fox""&&If anyone has to ask, they're streets behind.&&Oh i forgot about him.

They didn’t really even want to make Deadpool but he “leaked” the test footage he paid to have made and the internet blew up. Then they made the film on a relatively small budget because they still didn’t believe completely in the movie. It had a worldwide gross of 3/4 of a Billion dollars on a budget of $58 million. 

So yeah, Ryan Reynolds gets paid whatever he wants now. &&Yeah, well, to be fair, RDJ made the entire Marvel franchise successful. Iron Man is literally the first film that made the formula work. 

Before that, they were pumping out movies like *The Incredible Hulk*, and licensing out half their franchises to FOX so they could pump out shit like *The Wolverine*. 

Now it's not just a multi-billion-dollar franchise — it's literally the most profitable film franchise in history. 

So yeah, give RDJ whatever the hell he wants. &&Civil War without Tony finding out Winter Soldier killed his parents and going HAM (without being over powerful) would have had  no emotion outside of Black Panther.&&The Russos gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly that Civil War wouldn't have been done without Iron man/Downey Jr., and that *a* backup plan for Cap 3 was a storyline based on the comics where Cap might've been forced to fight mind-controlled civilian armies.&&> Might as well do Civil War without Grant or Lee.

I remember reading reports at the time that Norton essentially directed aspects of the movie himself. They filmed here in Toronto, partially in a studio where I've worked, and I believe those reports based on what I've heard.

But yeah, overall Marvel has a payment issue. They supposedly try to leverage it by offering much larger payments if they bring you back to fulfill the later movies, but that's (understandably) not as reported on.&&> an actor can be so good and appear to have so much fun that he wouldn’t just do it for a standard rate.

That's the thing though, his rate is standard, for RDJ. If his presence in the movie will double the revenue, then wouldn't the ""standard rate"" for that be double the pay?

I understand what you're saying, but RDJ can command those prices, so he will. Very few people will actively argue for lower pay when doing their job so well.&&I think RDJ is retired except for these movies.  He keeps raising his price -- no bluff.  You pay him or you don't and he's happily retired.

It's like going to buy a new car that you don't need, you can get a steal.&&RDJ is absolutely not personally asking for that money at that level. It's his agent and legal team doing all the hard work. He probably let's his agent know what he's really wanting, and the agent negotiates with the company for him. His agents probably just tell him that they are in negotiations and that if he gives them more time to negotiate with the studio, they'll get him everything he really wants. He probably just shows up and signs a few forms. &&> I understand this completely. And RDJ deserves it.

Actors in franchise roles represent an anomaly, as they have full monopoly over their characters. They don't receive millions for being great actors, but for being a specific actor associated with a role that they didn't even come up with in the first place. Iron Man would've been just as great with a number of other actors in the role, the suit, the effects, the script, all of this would've still been there. But because in this specific universe Iron Man happened to be RDJ, now RDJ is inseparable from Iron Man. 

The guy is a good actor, and very charismatic, but many actors are. I wouldn't say he deserves $50 million per picture, but everyone gets what they negotiate, not what they deserve, so good for him, I'm happy for him, and Disney will be OK.

But when you say he deserves $50 million per picture, just think of the thousands of people working on this movie who are receiving barely average salaries, including the people who designed, modeled, animated and rendered his suit and all his action scenes.

I honestly just don't think so. To pretend he is anything approaching the importance of RDJ for Iron Man's success is ludicrous.

He should have been glad to have been *over*payed for the first one and accepted the train was about to have a little less gravy, and then moved forward.&&Plus if you lower your rate for one production, every production after that will expect that low rate.

https://i.redd.it/9eftsw2q40vz.jpg&&It looks like they're pairing, with the positioning, who they'll have the largest struggle with.

Does he make trips to nearby planets to visit barber shops? Does he use the force to get his hair and beard to stay like that? 

I look forward to the answers to all these important questions&&Luke Skywalker: [from official trailer] I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then, it does now.


Yoda: ""Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.""

So Luke fears something. That could show he's both light and dark. 

Vader was to bring balance to the force. Luke is the balance. &&How smart is it to rest a lightsaber on your shoulder?&&So we know that Luke wears a red kyber crystal (the crystal used in Lightsabers that gives them their color) around his neck in the new flick. We also know that kyber crystals in the Disney canon change color depending on the user's force alignment. My theory is that the kyber crystal he wears is the same one from his old green saber from RotJ.

We haven't seen any of the other Knights of Ren, and we don't really have any indication that they're still alive. I think that Ben became angry at Luke over something and recruited other students (who weren't really old enough or hadn't earned the right to their own lightsaber yet) to join Snoke's First Order, but that Snoke required that they slaughter Luke's Jedi first. Luke arrived right as the Knights were finishing off the new Jedi order he had been building and then flew into a blind rage, slaughtering the Knights of Ren one by one as maliciously and violently as possible. While this happened his kyber crystal began to ""bleed"" (as it's being called) and turn red, and he stopped just short of killing his nephew when he realized he had begun to fall to the dark side as well. 

Luke's spirit wasn't broken by the death of his students, but in his own lack of self-discipline. When he says he's scared of Rey's power because he's seen it before, he's talking about *himself*. He doesn't think he's worthy to train new Jedi, and he wears his kyber crystal as a reminder of what he sees as his own taintedness. I think this is also supported by Kylo's actions in Episove VII - Hux at one point says that Kylo should be careful of letting his own ambitions get in the way of objectivity. Luke isn't building a new Jedi order, and he isn't currently a threat to the First Order - Kylo simply cannot get over the fact that he couldn't beat his uncle and the message that sends about the Dark Side's shortcomings. Moreover, he believes that the only way to purge the Light Side from his conscience is to eliminate Luke to prove once and for all that his teachings were inferior nonsense. 

&&Light Luke: who are u?

I’m hoping for a Yoda style laughing Luke.&&Finally, now I can practice my force powered field goals.&&REYLO IS CONFIRMED THEY'RE TOUCHING LIGHTSABERS &&Wow, nothing blatant with Luke ""turning his back"" in the Light version of the poster and ""hiding under his hood"" in the Dark.

If they're going to tie up canon, the happiest ending here is that Luke realizes that the Jedi are as much of a problem as the Sith, and is going to train our Rey of hope (what, is her name on the nose?) in a ""third way,"" one that ... dun dun ... brings balance to the Force. Like some sort of mirrored symmetrical pair of posters. 

Someone in marketing is very pleased with themselves.&&Gray jedi for sure
&&Kylo Ren is so goofy looking.  He just doesn't seem evil.  He just seems like a douche.&&Am I the only one that thinks Adam Driver's face in this looks extremely weird? Something just looks very out of place.&&Kylo lightsaber position is super awkward, like he’s trying to cut his neck or get an haircut.&&Seems kinda straight forward to me. It's all about the ""grey"" side of the force. Luke realizes that the Jedi's problem has always been their obsession with ""light side"" rules and their lack of familiar relationships is actually a bad thing.

Maybe he tried to keep Kylo Ren at an arms distance when he was a kid and that caused Kylo to start believing in Snokes ""grey"" teachings (because they make more sense) and turn against his family. 

It's J.J. Abrams saying that it makes no sense that one of the supposedly worst things a Jedi can do is fall in love. &&I find this poster so great I think everyone should Czech it out! &&I feel like Kylo's hands should swap places. That grip looks so awkward.&&The Jedi and Sith must become one to balance the force.

Luke is that balance. He will be both simultaneously. &&This is outrageous! Now there are two of them? &&I heard something interesting earlier though it's probably already been raised:

Usually the bad guy gets put at the back of the posters, this is true of [every single one](https://theburningbloggerofbedlam.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/all7starwarsposters_theburningbloggerofbedlam.jpg) except (arguably) Episode 2, the person I was talking to speculated that maybe this means Luke is going to be the 'bad guy' this time around.&&I swear I saw this a couple of days ago somewhere on reddit, or am i going crazy and having some kind of deja vu of the future?&&Everything I see regarding The Last Jedi makes me more certain that the series is gonna end with everyone realizing that balance between light and dark is what the universe really needs and the grey Jedi were right all along&&Why is there a spoiler in a movie poster? &&Is luke a clone?  Since there are 2 of him on the poster?  Maybe they cloned him from his hand.&&TIL: Rey has more friends than Kylo Ren&&Luke is in both the light & dark side&&[deleted]&&Luke Vs. edgy Luke&&I just re-watched TFA, and I have to get something off my chest.

Why is that Kylo Ren who presumably trained in the force for years is beaten by a girl who had no training, and only discovered she could use the force just hours before?&&I agree.  

Luke is most likely wracked with grief and guilt over how he couldn't foresee or prevent Ben's fall and how all of his other students died.  

My money is that he thinks the Light and Dark Side practitioners cannot exist without the other, similar to how Batman always has to contend with the Joker.  Neither ever truly wins; the vanquished always returns.  Maybe he thinks that by exiling himself, he can break from the cycle.  

His journey will lead him to realize that, regardless of the evil that can arise in the face of a prevailing good, he has a duty to stand against it; that a world without Batman is worse than a world with Batman and the Joker.  &&I️ saw a theory that Luke’s teachings will be that Jedi’s must learn to utilize both the light and dark side of the force. This poster makes me believe that a bit more&&i just love it when good jedis go bad
&&Synopsis: In this heart-wrenching slice of life tale, Grand Master Jedi Luke Skywalker battles with his insecurities of having put on some weight, making him look old and wise as opposed to his younger days when he enjoyed ravishing good looks.&&Or they just wanted to put Luke on both sides because he's the most recognizable and they want people to know he'll be in this movie?&&Luke is a Grey Jedi which means he is both Light and Dark.

This is why he says the Jedi must die, because Jedi need to have a balance of both light and dark (grey) and not just 1 of the two.&&I just figure it makes more sense for Kylo’s arc to have him there than Snoke. We’re probably going to get a bit of Kylo Ren backstory that explains what his relationship with Luke is like, plus there’s the whole thing of him being torn between two paths.&&My guess is it's all a pandering generic story full of explosions and Stormtroopers as a vehicle to sell cheaply made plastic toys and saturate my peripheral vision with merchandise for the next 25 years but I'm just speculating. &&I've never seen a more relevant image.&&/r/retiredmeme&&/r/retiredgif except its not a gif. is there an /r/retiredjpeg ?&&Wait, what?

I was always confused as to why this prophesy was ever seen as a good thing by the Jedi. At the time, the light side was massive and the Sith were a rumor. I get you can interpret that in many ways, but how in the world did they think that ""bring balance to the force"" meant ""good things for the Jedi?""&&I think you are reading too much into it.

When Luke talks about his fear, he is saying that he was unaware of the substantial threat that that power represents and that he has since learned how potentially destructive it can be.  This is most comparable to a fear of fire.  A fear of fire is healthy and can keep you alive, but it is often a learned fear that results from a painful experience.  This fear typically encourages you to avoid it or, at the very least, respect its power and be cautious with it in future interactions. 

When Yoda talks of fear, he is referring to the fear of loss, fear of death, fear of powerlessness, etc.  Fears that can drive you to seek out greater power in order to conquer it, which can lead to the Dark Side.  These fears are things you cannot control or prevent.  All the medical advances imaginable and all the power of the Force cannot prevent the mortal body from eventually dying.  These fears are unhealthy and focussing on them can be self-destructive, such as when the fear of losing Padme drove Anakin to the Dark Side.  


 &&That angle is similar to the balance between Neo and Agent Smith. The Matrix depended on them balancing each other. As one grew more powerful, the other grew in power. As one was destroyed, the other was destroyed.

If Vader came to the light side before his death, maybe Luke is tempted toward the dark side.&&> So Luke fears something. That could show he's both light and dark

The thing is, I wouldn't expect that kind of logical consistency from the franchise that has the phrase:

**Only the sith deal in absolutes** &&Yoda says this then turns around and voices his fear in Anakin's training &&You see... you have start with smaller lightsabers so you can build up an immunity to larger ones.&&It's acupuncture, only burnier.&&It's actually a historically accurate fencing guard commonly referred to as ""key guard"", where it rests on your upper arm (Rey is closer to it than Kylo; she's actually pretty much 100% correct on it).

However...not a good idea to use that method with a blade made out of fuckin billion-degrees-Kelvin plasma.

And it doesn't HAVE to rest on your arm, but if you try it, it's pretty difficult to miss your arm, especially when you consider (again) hot plasma.&&As smart as it is to become a Jedi&&>When he says he's scared of Rey's power because he's seen it before, he's talking about himself. 

One problem: Luke says that the power he's ""seen before"" *didn't* scare him enough back when he first saw it. If it was his own display of power that made him go into hiding, then it definitely *did* scare him back then. It makes much more sense that he's talking about Kylo. He didn't recognize the warning signs of Ben turning to the dark side, and that's why he's extra cautious when it comes to training Rey.&&Could it just be vaders crystal?&&I like the cut of your jib. Newsletter, etc... 

If you are correct, I feel we're missing out on a killer scene involving the KoR slaughtering Jedi, and then Luke going apeshit on them. Think back to the Vader scene in Rogue One, but now imagine Luke doing that against the KoR, then culminating in a battle between he and Kylo. &&i like this&&Can you point me to a source on color-changing kyber crystals? And what does that mean for differences in blue, green, yellow and purple?&&[What is this, a Nintendo game?](http://i.imgur.com/5iZX0Cx.jpg)&&The symmetry gives a very cool effect.&&I believe that's him on the lower left of the dark side poster.&&He’s in the poster &&To be fair, lots of people did. &&Rose, a resistance fighter. &&New character I'm guessing.&&Porkins' daughter.&&I don't know... I can't even have enough ketchup when I asked for extra.&&But without saltos and CG jumping around&&I sort of want Luke to be more of a raw power guy, like Yoda. I want to see him fight without a lightsaber, just force blasting people left and right.&&I feel like it might not ever meet our expectations, but I hope it does.&&Kenobi's battle with Maul in Rebels should be the gold standard for expectations. &&He could turn off the blade first. &&It's actually a real guard in historical fencing. If he twists his hips toward the direction the blade is pointing and uses the lightsaber to thrust.

That position (albeit his is extremely half-assed) gives the illusion that he has no reach, when, in reality, he's coiled up like a snake. Rey's position is spot-on.

Edit: as long as he stays far enough away from the blade, itself.&&Yup, apparently it's called a **[TIE Silencer](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kylo_Ren%27s_TIE_silencer)**, and they do indeed have a **[Lego set](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Kylo-Ren-s-TIE-Fighter-75179)** for it already.&&It's the middle movie of the trilogy so I expect the dark side to win with a last-second field goal.&&It's normal for a left handed person. &&how's Dr. Watson doing these days?&&My cat's breath smells like cat food.&&Spiderluke I vs Spiderluke IIII&&Because he got shot by an extremely powerful weapon that is known for sending stormtroopers flying, right after killing his father and becoming extremely emotionally conflicted and probably unfocused, and is also slowly bleeding out, and also got hurt once by Finn, and also has the advantage for most of the fight, facing a girl who is naturally talented in the force, has good fighting skills, and has...plot armor honestly.&&A) Kylo Ren was bleeding out from Chewie's blaster. A blaster that had been shown to throw stormtroopers into the air.

B) Kylo Ren had just killed his father, and is shaken. According to the script and novelization, he even feels that he was ""weakened""by the act.

C) Kylo Ren had just been lightsaber-slashed across the back by Finn.

D) Kylo Ren was not trying to kill, or even seriously wound, Rey. Snoke had commanded him to ""bring the girl [to him]"". Kylo also took an obvious interest in Rey as well, offering to ""show her the ways of the Force"" when he could have easily pushed her off the breaking cliff.

E) Rey wasn't completely untrained. She was previously shown to be more than proficient in wielding a staff. And while you can argue it a moot point because a lightsaber is not a staff, they're not so markedly different that skill in one can't be shifted to another. Rey even uses the lighsaber as if it was a staff, mostly jabbing and blocking.

F) When Rey eventually overpowers Kylo, she's using the Force, which she's very strong in, not just her muscles.

Even with all of this pointing in Rey's favor, she still spends most of the fight blocking and running away, with a few sporadic jabs. This stuff has been argued and explained for going on two whole years now. I honestly don't get how people could have missed all of this.&&Because he had just been shot in the chest lol&&I get all that - but Luke had problems seeing a tiny little flying training ball and he was presumably one of the most powerful Jedi ever.

Just seems rushed - they could have spent more time showing us how she developed her power, even if it was indirectly.&&Cause she has plot armor&&I was actually enjoying Kylo Ren up until that scene.  Unfortunately that ruined the character and any danger from him for me.  &&But wouldn't Luke be the Joker rather than Batman?&&I posit he's on both because he has learned to use both. He can move between the Light and the Dark and that's why the Jedi are no more.   

There is only ""The Force"" and how to control it.&&Plot Twist:  luke suffers from a split personality due to the events of ""return of the jedi"".  one light, the other dark.  &&I agree. He probably thinks that for the sith to disappear, the jedi must also disappear, so that is why he disappeared. But, with the existence of this sith master, maybe he was wrong. Maybe the sith will always exist, and thus, the jedi must always exist. &&Like the cool and hot side of the pillow&&Mind. Blown.&&I think he sees that the Jedi-Sith bifurcation is unnatural and leads to problem children like Ben as well as bigger issues like the Jedi protecting their monkish order and the Sith being more evil for being forced to go underground. I think he will argue the Galaxy needs a holistic Force wielder, not a set of good guys and bad guys in different colored robes.&&I like the theory that he is still destined to bring balance. But real balance wouldn't be empowering the light or destroying the dark.

Actual balance would mean either staying in the middle or eliminating the Jedi/Sith dynamic altogether.

The EU has touched on this a lot. Basically making one side stronger will only increse the other. Or that having many Jedi with the light side spread across them means that the 2 or 3 active siths will have a much more concentrated power.

True balance means the light can't win.&&Temper the Dark with the Light&&He said it in the trailer ""there's so much more"".&&What's up with that weird box in your comment? I've been seeing it all over reddit recently. I have no idea why...&&/r/jedisgonewild&&This is definitely true, ""Luke is in this one"" is definitely the message they mean to advertise, but it would have been designed differently if it wasn't meant to represent some kind of struggle and dichotomy.&&I've not seen that in a while.&&A green lightsaber would be a fashionable addition indeed&&Shit, even /r/retiredmeme seems to have retired.  

Meta.&&it's /r/retiredjpg&&[Here](https://i.imgur.com/sYnodi9.gif)&&I'm guessing they don't want to show the green one in the promo materials, it's supposed to be this epic moment we get to see in the cinema.&&Because artistic license. 

In Star Wars, blue = good guys and red = bad guys. 

It was even used during the bridge scene in TFA, most notably. I'm sure you know, but for anybody who doesn't, watch the color shift behind Kylo Ren on the bridge scene. It shifts as the scene progresses, until the blue is completely gone.

&&luke shoud be at the top, since kylo and rey are the ones on opposite sides and he's the mentor to both&&Rey gave it back to him?&&they do, in the [official poster](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9427327/star_wars_poster.jpg)&&Im trying so hard not to read too much into that...&&Luke: If you reference prequel memes one more time I am literally going to join the dark side.

Emperor Coke.  &&He cultures and eats midichlorians &&Porgs are plentiful&&I assume he survives on a strict diet of porg chops.&&He used the new Mach5 Quintuple Blade Lightsaber™ for an extra-close shave&&[deleted]&&IIRC the idea of a ""Light side of the force"" was reinforced later on in the Star Wars series and isn't really referenced in that form in the original trilogy.. The original idea, I thought, was that Jedi were like monks who valued balancing the force and not giving into corrupting influences like fear, anger and hatred and that the Dark side were those who eschewed balance for the sake of their own goals and to utilize those emotions they were supposed to push away.

It seems like gradually over time this idea of a dark and light side of the force was established via things like KoTOR and other similar Star Wars properties and now we have this intrinsic understanding of the Jedi as light, the Sith as dark and the grey Jedi as light and dark but IMO the Jedi were always intended to be focused on balancing themselves and the Force as a sort of monastic calling.&&Well, he didn't balance it, he tipped the scale and nearly exterminated the Jedi.

I've had the same thought as you, but I feel as if he caused a Sith revival, but not a take over, it would have been more accurate.

But perhaps Luke is the balance. They seem to be heavily hinting that he is not just a Jedi.&&[This image explains it well](https://i.imgur.com/gyQxUOU.jpg)&&It doesn't mean to bring equality between evil and good, it means to bring balance to nature.

The powers of the Sith were unnatural and disruptive. The Force was out of harmony.&&That's the problem with the way the Force has ""evolved"" narratively. It's brought a great deal of confusion. Originally, the Force was meant to be one stream of universal will. The Jedi flow *with* the Force. That is to say they let it guide their actions as well as control it (something Obi-Wan tried to explain in the very first Star Wars movie). They are ""one with the Force."" The Sith, on the other hand, bend the Force to their will. 

If you think of the Force as the consciousness of the galaxy at large, the Jedi attune to that conscious will while the Sith attempt to subvert or dominate it. Or perhaps as a river, the Jedi ride down the natural flow of the river while the Sith divert it with dams or canals. In other words, they corrupt its natural flow to wield it. It is why a great deal of Jedi training dealt with the control of emotions and avoiding attachments, because it makes it less likely that you will impose your own will on the Force and more likely you can connect to its natural flow.

So by that interpretation, balance means no dark-siders at all. However, new canon, including some canon with Lucas's involvement, has changed the way the Force is thought of. Your interpretation is the more modern one, but it's interesting to see how one time ""balance"" might have been a very good thing for the Jedi.&&Exactly. OP's observation is too simplistic and has been done. The writers wouldn't do that to us. The franchise is more clever than that.&&Pretty sure that line was intentional to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Jedi.&&The battle of wits has begun!&&I agree that it would make more sense for Luke to be referring to Kylo.

I think in this situation the line is being viewed through the lens of the ""Luke retaliated against the KoR"" theory, this makes interpreting it a special case.

Luke didn't respect his own power enough, made a mistake, and doesn't want to pass that burden on to Rey.&&I think that scene would come in one of Rey's Force Visions. Maybe in that weird tree? I'm pretty sure that raining scene of Luke is the same one as the Knights of Ren from TFA.&&or what COULD have been in Ep3 when Anakin took down the Jedi temple.&&Green is for scholars and more force-oriented jedis, blue is for fighter, focused on swordfighting, yellow is for weirdos, purple is for pussies that won't kill the emperor when given the chance and rather wait for another council member (who hasn't even attained the rank of a master!) to decide the fate of the world for them. Or something like that, I'm sure...&&If they're not careful, they'll fucking fuse together through all this symmetry dancing&&It's like poetry.  It rhymes.&&The fact that the backgrounds aren’t fade together just bothers me. 

Absolutely fucking badass regardless&&No with all that and even cornier dialogue please&&Is the high ground also unnecessary or needed here?&&I, for one, loved that colourgaurd spin sequence. &&Trust me if they stick to the saber duel at the end of the force awakens it will be that weighty combat we loved so much about empire strikes back.

The Kylo saber fight in awakens was amazing choreography without being over the top.&&And less lava please&&What is a salto?&&Like a “sup bitch I don’t even need a saber anymore, watch this,” type deal?&&I want to see both, Luke wrecking people with the Force and then busting out the lightsaber when shit gets real.&&What made the Obi/Maul rebels duel work was the history between the two characters, and the dialog immediately prior to the fight. 

I wouldn't want all duels to be so brief. For example, the Sidious/Windu fight worked out because there's no personal hatred between them. It's simply Sidious wanting to kill the Jedi getting in his way, and Windu wanting to arrest Sidious on behalf of the Senate. The choreography could've been better, but the length of the combat seemed appropriate.&&Not in that battle stance he's not!&&Additionally, until further notice, all Thursdays shall be followed by a Friday. &&Sand is coarse.  &&Also he was holding back against her because he wanted to turn her to the dark side.&&I don’t understand why this is so hard to grasp for some people.

They use that joke/conceit like five times in the film, and people just forget that when it Kylo takes one to the chest. &&> I honestly don't get how people could have missed all of this.

people don't read or look into it, they're the first in the world of billions to ever think or question that plot...

smh. &&[deleted]&&Not if Kevin Conroy is Snoke&&Not necessarily.  

When Batman started, he was just fighting petty criminals and the mob.  Eventually, he was forced to contend with the likes of the Joker, Two Face, the Red Hood, and numerous other villains.  Batman has, several times, wondered if Gotham is truly a better place because of him; whether the villains he creates and has to contend with would still pose the same threat if he wasn't Batman.  

Usually, Batman decides that Gotham does need Batman and that he does provide a noticeable benefit, even if he draws colorful and dangerous foes to the forefront.  He isn't capable of standing by and allowing criminals like the one that killed his parents to thrive.  

Luke may feel responsible for Kylo, but he is also responsible for the fall of the Empire and the redemption of his father.  The galaxy would be a much worse off place if he never got involved.  He's allowed the mistakes he's made to overshadow his accomplishments and it prevents him from upholding his responsibility to the galaxy.  &&95% sure this is ""Mark Hamill voiced the joker for years"" joke that whooshed hundreds of people&&Luke just likes to introduce a little chaos. &&I mean mark Hamil is the joker so yes. &&I see what you did there


EDIT: for having fat fingers&&His uncle Ben was murdered. That makes him Spider-Man.&&Well Luke is the Joker, so it would make sense in the analogy he would be the Joker.&&Which might be why the poster is gray since ""Gray Jedi"" was part of star wars and after the disney cutover they seem to be cherry picking from the extended universe. 

Lets see, Luke almost succumbed to the dark side. Luke tried to recreate the jedi order but failed, went into exile, and most likely has seen it's flaws. Yep, seems like Luke is a Gray Jedi to me.&&I always took the 'the last jedi' thing to mean he is the last one of them and that both Ray and Kylo Ren would move to the center and not really be part of either side.&&This would be intriguing, honestly. Seeing Luke transition between light and dark force energy would be pretty awesome. &&This is why Kyle Katarn was always my favorite force user.&&And speaks to himself in the same way Gollum/Smeagol did.&&So he's the second Revan?&&Thats been a known theme of star wars for awhile. Like when Anakin was supposed restore ""balance"" to the force, he technically did. The light side of the force (jedi) were too powerful, so he restored balance by destroying them .&&The power he gained by going to the dark side was crazy in the EU. He literally crushed an AT-AT. Was one of my favorite scenes from the dark horse comics back in the day.&&Goddamn TLJ probably ripped off this rip off meme.&&i thought he tossed his green one. Has anything in the new books/comics material shown him with his green saber?&&[deleted]&&I hope that's true. I want him to pop it and just wreck some people. Similar to how Yoda went from 0-100000 in the prequel movies. 

There were a lot of things I hated about them, but balls to the wall Yoda rage was not one of them. &&I took that to represent the conflict within Kylo Ren, during that scene he is torn between light and dark, as the lighting turns red he commits to the dark side.

On the official poster above Luke's face is lit half in blue and half in red - which supports these ""grey"" Jedi / ""he can access both the light and the dark side"" theories.&&On this one, Rey is in the villain position.&&What if Rey is being trained to use both sides of the force and to be balanced? So she is the middle of the last Jedi, Luke, and the last Sith, Kylo.&&Rey is in the middle because she's the one who could go either way. Luke is light, Kylo is dark -- in this movie both sides will be trying to pull Rey to their side of the force.&&I LOVE how half of Luke's face is blue-tinged and half is red-tinged.&&For some reason if seems like Snoke should be on there. He's presented as this incredibly powerful puppet master in TFA and is featured in the trailers. Excluding him from the poster seems like a mix signal that he's not really _that_ important.&&Which one is the official!?&&My hope is that after episode VI, Luke became more of a gray jedi. It would make for an interesting change from the old jedi ways and it would keep the prophecy that Anakin would be responsible for bringing balance to the force.&&I mean... He's looking over his shoulder behind him on the light side... Facing forward on the dark side...&&Rey: I hate it when he does that.&&This is getting out of hand&&Snoke  is being hidden. There is something about his physicality or appearence that gives away information about him. 

He's nearly the most underpromoted character in merchandise, but he's the first voice we hear in the first TFA teaser trailer and he's the first voice we hear in the TLJ trailer. He is 'important'. 

 They obfuscate his face in TFA, only illuminating the [right side](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTvuZTLnae4/maxresdefault.jpg) and hiding him in shadow and scale. And they do the same in the new trailer - this time [using his hand.](http://media.comicbook.com/2017/10/star-wars-the-last-jedi-supreme-leader-snoke-new-trailer-1-1036477.jpg). &&Maybe it is! :O&&That's why the community gave him that name. :)&&You're a wizard Snuke.&&[She's got a snuke in her snizz!](http://southpark.cc.com/clips/155539/snuke-found)&&*shmelting&&Force yogurt. Full of nutrients, it is.&&Or they used to be, at least&&I really want to see this now.&&According to the Jedi, anyway.  Obviously team Light is going to tell you that Dark is unnatural and evil.&&Interesting. That makes a lot of sense in explaining their perception of it.&&He tipped it in the siths favor, but then killed the emperor and brought the balance 

I think both sides misinterpreted the prophecy and it fucked both the Jedi and the Sith&&I don't think that's what balance means. I see it as the Jedi and the Sith are two opposing sides both drawing power from the Force, and their opposite aims and focuses cause there to be conflict in the Force itself. Balance then means only one side remaining. The Jedi assumed it would be them and the Chosen One would destroy the Sith for good, but they were nearly very wrong.&&[deleted]&&You're right, it could be done that way and work well. &&Upvoted for explaining purple&&""Yellow is for weirdos"" I'm dying over here 😂&&Wait are red lightsabers no longer ghe result of using  artifically manufactured kyber crystals? &&Fuuuu....jjjjehhhn....haaaaaaaaaaaa!!!&&Two buckets of popcorn talking to each other couldn't be cornier than the dialogues in the prequels&&We can’t have another decade of dank memes if this isn’t chocked full of corny, overly-dramatic dialogue.&&Can you....can you get cornier? &&Jumping from Porg to Porg, etc.&&[deleted]&&It's over Snoke, I have the high ground!&&Like how Palpatine should have been in RotS?&&And rough. &&And it gets everywhere.&&And lastly, don't forget she mindfucked him in the interrogation scene.

**I AM THE NIGHT**&&Reading through your comment got me thinking.  I don't remember where I saw it, but I've seen this concept before that whenever you turn on a light, somewhere a shadow is created.  Light and dark exist together, and in a way the light created the dark.

But if you turn the light off completely, then everything is plunged into darkness anyway.  Without the light, there would be nothing *but* dark.&&Mark Hamil is pretty much *the* voice actor for the Joker, the joke referred to that.&&He's making a joke because Mark Hamil voices the Joker in animated Batman stuff.&&He only said that because Mark Hamill voiced the Joker, but nice counter-argument lol&&[deleted]&&are you saying that Luke is a ladder?&&Kill as a Jedi and no one ***bats*** an eye...

Kill as a Sith and everyone LOSES THEIR MIND&&Yea, they way I see him in Return..he was like *riiiiiight* there, and came back at the last second.   

Now, after exile and years of study/contemplation, he knows he can tap those sweet Dark Side powers and still be a good guy.&&Eh he was flirting with it, force choking the gamorrean guard, attempting to force persuade jabba after doing it to bib fortuna, surrendering to his emotions to beat Vader, only after lopping off his fathers mechanical hand and catching sight of his own, did he regain control.


emotion drives him, he is too much his fathers son&&The chosen one who will bring balance to the force.&&Asohka is pretty much a new Canon gray jedi, Ezra and Kanan from Star Wars Rebels are close to that (they're more directly aligned to the Light side, but don't give a lot of importance to the rules)&&I don't see that as a bad thing.  There were some gems in the EU before Lucas sold it all off; Admiral Thrawn, and the concept of a species that is no longer force sensitive.  &&In ROTJ it was pretty much implied he was in ""Grey Jedi"" territory. His first appearance is choking out a pig monster with the force. I wouldn't be surprised if they explored that more. It hasn't really been done on film.&&I'm pretty much dying to see it.   

Like... how much would people flip out of Luke just started blasting some Knight of Ren with Force Lightning?    

&&as long as one of his personalities sounds like the joker.  i don't care which one, but one of them should.  &&i thought revan just suffered from force amnesia?  guess i'll have to play KotOR again !&&That's a more interesting interpretation of the films, but Lucas has said that ""balance"" really means ""all light side"" -- the dark side is inherently imbalanced.&&He has it on his belt again after the throne room scenes and when he's back on Endor burning Vader's body. &&sure, he still uses it in the comics shortly after the battle of Endor, but that's still a long time before the sequels&&That would fuck my brain. I hope that happens. Or maybe a new color. &&Rainbow colored. Woke Skywoker.&&Am i stupid? Wasnt whats her name handing back his lightsaber for 20 minutes in the last movie?&&Mark has said Luke isn't evil I really doubt he has a red saber.&&Exactly the point I was making. The blue represents his good, the light side within him. The red, his evil, dark side. He gives in to the dark side, and the blue gives way to red.

As for the posters, I wouldn't put too much creedance to them. Of the four main characters highlighted (Luke, Kylo, Leia, and Rey) only Kylo isn't bathed in a mix of blue and red.

Maybe it means something, maybe it's just compositional. Hopefully, it does mean something, like that we'll see more of a morally greyness of the characters. From what we've seen in the trailers it looks like we're going to see more of the post-RotJ history. Perhaps we'll see Luke and Leia making hard choices, maybe even that put them at odds. 

We've been told we'll find out about Rey's history, we've seen shots that indicate we'll learn more of what happened when Kylo turned on Luke.

I wouldn't be surprised to see Han show up in some flashback scenes as well. &&Eh, the Star Wars posters aren't really consistent about that. On most of them, the villain in the top center is layered behind the actors and made semi-transparent. Some posters don't have the villain on them at all, and one (The Empire Strikes Back) is *only* villains (the Emperor, Vader, storm troopers, and Fett).&&[Its multiple Jedi in ""The Last Jedi"". In germany the movie is called ""Die letzten Jedi"" and that is multiple ones.

That while the Sith aren't correct, the Jedi weren't a perfect institution. Yoda himself said the prophecy of the balance of the force may have been misinterpreted. Maybe this trilogy is about Luke coming to realize it's about balancing the emotionless clarity of the light, with the passion of the dark, without losing control to either side.&&I'm so hoping for Luke having gone crazy and now he's having maniacal fits where Hamil goes full Joker.&&Luke: Bantha poodoo!&&""NO! IT'S NOT TRUE!""&&Which is kinda dumb since he was shouting it at Finn, not screaming his own Stormtrooper identification like a retarded Pokemon.&&Is Force Yogurt canon?

Also, have you seen my force yogurt cannon?&&[deleted]&&It's also the view of Lucas, from an out of universe perspective.&&Yes, because they actually ARE unnatural and evil.
&&Even if you looked at the world today. If someone told you that they wanted to bring balance to our world, you'd probably see that as a good thing. Balance implies stability, serenity. But if it was a literal balance between good and evil, that might actually mean that there needs to be more terrorism, because it is currently being mostly overwhelmed by counter-terrorism.

The misinterpreted prophecy is a common trope: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist

Anything that is cryptically worded can have it's meaning flipped by changing perspective.&&Perhaps part of the prophecy wasn't just balancing light and dark but reducing the number of Jedi entirely? The wisdom of the prophecy could also include that no one group of people should have that power. The Jedi claimed they were on the side of good but *everybody* claims that. ""From my point of view the Jedi are evil.""&&And would have been fine from one of the stuffy members of the council, but it was said by obi-wan who was never really supposed to represent the arrogance of the jedi&&Nope.&&So uncivilized.&&I will make it cornier!&&This is the most amazing and beautiful thing I have ever read.&&The Trickster!&&Only a Sith deals in absolutes &&Then you are lost!!!&&***I HATE SAND***&&From my perspective the Jedi have been last...**for centuries**&&In the RotS novel, Yoda discovered that the stronger the light of the Jedi, the more powerful the new Sith became.

This is what Mace Windu did.&&mmmmm tapping those sweet sweet dark side powers&&>attempting to force persuade jabba after doing it to bib fortuna

That's perfectly allowed for Jedi though. When circumstances demand it they even brute forced peoples minds to interrogate people.&&I mean there was no such thing as a Grey Jedi in 1983.

Like Octarine? &&Snoke = Darth Binks confirmed!&&Snoke is the key to all of this. &&100%   
I'm going out on a limb here and calling it now.   
Luke, is a not all good, and not all bad. I think we will see him harness his anger, *for good*. And, I think Rey will have issues with this. AND! I think we will see Kylo BACK with Luke at the end of 8, and Rey might be willingly or unwillingly in the hands of Snoke.   
   
And I think Luke will have planned it.

Still isn't. It's a contradiction. If you're Grey, you're not a Jedi. But stuff like force choke doesn't have to be bad. It's only really bad if you're doing it to torture them rather than kill someone that requires to be killed.&&Oh yea... Luke pulls a Palpatine on Kylo....

Mark Hamill is a good actor at best in my opinion, but he's amazing at understanding his characters and the universes they reside in. I wouldn't be surprised if Luke being darkside/greyside has a lot to do with Hamill petitioning for it.&&bruh.&&I'm in a similar frame.

I think that Luke dies and Kylo finally understands what he was trying to teach him. I also think he gets discarded by Snoke in favour of Rey. 

I don't think Luke ""plans"" it and I don't think he's ""good"" - I just think he's using Rey to correct his mistakes with Kylo, which is why she ends up in the hands of Snoke. And Luke has to pay for that.&&Saved for posterity.&&I sort of agree. I think Luke is all good, but not all Jedi nor all light-side. I think he will bring a more nuanced understanding of the Force.

But I trust Rian Johnson as a storyteller. I'm excited.&&Going out on a limb? There are like 20 variations of this plot line all over the internet. It’s a pretty popular prediction. Switched  alignments for Kyle Ren and Rey, Luke is “the Last Jedi” because he is going grey/wants to rid the galaxy of the light/dark split, etc. &&If you remember, Luke had to channel his anger to beat down Darth Vader/his old man in front of the Emperor on the second Death Star.

It'd also be a follow through of the overpowered protagonist and underpowered villain of E7 which is a huge reversal of traditional story design that I'm hoping wasn't by accident.

Essentially, the Force is in balance when the only practitioners are doing so the way the Jedi are supposed to. Letting it guide them completely. 

That said, to me, the only Jedi that really did a good job of that would be Yoda, Old Ben Kenobi (not wartime General Obi-Wan), and Qui-Gon Jinn. And Jinn was the best of them. He followed the will of the Force regardless of it's effects on himself. He wasn't on the Council because he defied the Council. He didn't defy the Council because it was fun or thought he knew better than them, he defied it because the Force guided him to do so. And he respected the will of the Force more than the Council.  

&&Yes, the movies.&&Just look at The Senates’ face. &&The Jedi believed in Love. *Love* was one of their central pillars along with Compassion. The Jedi didn't believe in *attatchment*, and with good reason. If a magical space wizard gets too attatched to something he might try to use his magical space wizard powers to save it, to the detriment of others. 


Anakin being the prime example of this exact scenario in action.&&Well, that line is explained in episode 2. It’s not that the Jedi don’t believe in love, they basically tried to separate it because those feelings can drive you towards the dark side. Which is exactly what it did to Anakin. 

People are always reaching for something deeper when it comes to the prophecy talk. And maybe there is something, but sometimes the best explanation is right in front of you. The Jedi try to commune with the force and do what is right. The sith manipulate the force and do what they wish. Now things could get really interesting if someone like Yoda had been manipulating the force to live an extended life. I know I’m old canon his species lives for a long time but what if he had been trying to do things his way the whole time with his Jedi order and such and the only reason he stayed alive after they were defeated was to help train the last chance to stop the other side which was the sith. Would be an interesting story arc due to both sides being wrong and Luke coming to that conclusion.&&The current explanation for them being red is that the force-alignment/style of the user is reflected in their saber's crystal. Something like the dark side causes the crystal to 'bleed' and turn crimson. I think. &&This city is beyond saving&&Now [if I let you go](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dcanimated/images/3/36/Flash_and_Substance.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071101160046) , do you promise to turn yourself in? :)&&No /u/Bradley_Haran, ***WE*** have been dead for centuries&&**DON'T DO IT, I HAVE THE HIGH SAND!**&&> Finally, he saw the truth.

I know alot of people demonize Disney, but they saved us from Darth Icky and Development Hell, so....&&Unfortunately (depending on your point of view, it annoys me personally) the new canon is that red crystals aren’t synthetic anymore and are instead normal crystals that have been “bled” with a dark side ritual into the red. so it’s possible kylo is using Luke’s old saber and he messed up the ritual, causing his weird explodey saber. &&Thank you.

I wouldn't be surprised if Luke being darkside/greyside has a lot to do with Hamill petitioning for it.

Wouldn't be so sure on that, Mark Hamill himself has basically been saying that he disagrees with every choice that has been made for the character in this film - https://io9.gizmodo.com/mark-hamill-has-a-big-issue-with-luke-skywalker-in-the-1795562775&&I'm down with it.&&If Luke is teaching Rey, he will 100% die.

That was Disney's plan all along!&&Or maybe he will just laugh maniacally.&&Sorry state of affairs when the ‘95 Doom-clone, Star Wars game I played on my 486 Packard Bell, has a more interesting lead than a mainstream Disney Hollywood blockbuster. Just sayin’...&&What I mean is ""if"" that's the direction they go. It's because they finally decided to listen to Mark. The guys pretty much a Star Wars super nerd. they should have killed off Luke and let him direct it.&&He also said, iirc, that he regretted his phrasing on that.&&Mister Miyagi made it through more Karate Kid sequels than Daniel.&&I thought Anakin knocked off Padme with that move.&&I think Mark had similar thoughts.  He's alluded/outright stated on numerous occasions that he's unhappy with the direction taken with his character.  

And, as I recall, he wanted Luke, Leia, and Chewie to be on the adventure together again and see Han's fate at the hand of his son/Luke's student.  That would've definitely made him the focus of the story rather rather than passing the torch almost right away.  &&Ditto. Part of me hopes they borrow from the EU here. In the later EU Luke's son gets captured by the Solo's darkside child. 

He goes to get him back, and wrecks the Solo's kid, but can't bring himself to kill him. 

I would like Luke to be the protagonist in some fashion like that, with Rey being the ultimate protagonist as he tells her that he can't bring himself to nuke his dead sister and husband/friend's (assuming Leia dies) child, setting her up to finish it, and even giving Kylo an arc where he realizes maybe the dark side *isn't* so strong, if Luke can beat the bricks off him and leave. &&Luke Guystalker. &&I know but there's truth in the joke.&&It always seemed funny to me that *""Only a Sith deals in absolutes.""* is an absolute in itself.

&&>Only a Sith deals in absolutes

Clearly Obi-Wan wasn't taught quick maths in the Jedi Temple.&&> Only a Sith deals in absolutes

If there's anything this whole ""I'm your father and she's your sister"" clusterfuck taught us, it's that both Sith and Jedi will eventually have to deal with relatives…&&You have to get into the old EU for it to make sense because they only very briefly mention anything about it in the prequels. It's boiled down to the point that Obi-Wan makes about his disobeying the Council being the reason he doesn't have a seat on it. 

His decision to train Anakin without Council approval was an example of this. Because the Force had led him to Anakin in the first place, he felt it was his duty to the Force to train him. 


&&Well, Grievous got his sabers from conquest, hence why they were all Jedi. Finn was using Anakin's saber, as was Han. Because neither are force sensitive, they wouldn't leave any signature on the saber. Plus, I think the 'impression' is left during construction, not afterwards. Again, I'm not sure. &&That was a great episode, completely wholesome&&**I AM THE SAND**&&The Jedi's biggest problem is Jedi turning Sith.  They can never extinguish their enemy, because the enemy is always within.&&The Sith over time took on more and more powerful positions in the galaxy (Darth Plagueis was a powerful banker and his master was an influential engineer).

They used their positions to undermine Republic stability and the Jedi themselves. The Sith became masters of manipulating undercurrents and political backstabbing. Subterfuge lends itself quite well to the new Sith. &&I never read into the EU novels, but I never took it as literally ""Only two Sith in the galaxy at any time,"" just that they work in twos. One master with one apprentice, and no sprawling order with a council of masters and masses of members and trainees. When an apprentice feels he's ready to become the master, he either kills his master or breaks away and takes his own apprentice. 

But if you do take it literally their survival still makes plenty of sense. How are you going to find two bad guys in a population of trillions?&&Bear in mind that the Milky Way Galaxy has over 400 million stars, and that the vast majority of those have at least one planet. And in the Star Wars galaxy, which is probably about the same size as the Milky Way, most of those planets are inhabited. 

That means there are millions of planets where those two Sith could be hiding. Even with their force sensitivity, it would take the Jedi lifetimes to locate two Sith in a galaxy of trillions.&&The argument I believe would be that the force is a natural phenomenon, and without the Jedi identifying and training sensitive individuals, they would just cause chaotic damage and/or be drawn to evil by their additional power and insight.

The Jedi exist to prevent chaotic use of the force, but by training Jedi you also occasionally create a more powerful evil than would have otherwise existed. It's a choice between prolific low-level evil and moderate high-level evil&&#1 Rule of Star Wars: If they didn't die onscreen, they ain't dead:

I had a ticket, and my mom had her pass, so while I was back for spring break we thought we should go to Disneyland to enjoy it like my dad would have wanted us to. Lo and behold, I misread the calendar and ended up there on a blackout date. We were already talking to a CM about transferring my dad’s AP to my sister’s name, and when she discovered my mistake, she happily gave me a ticket for the day, then proceeded to ask what my dad’s favorite ride was and provided us with a fast pass.

This sort of imposed sense of selflessness that Reddit seems to be placing on a corporation seems silly. As if they're supposed to thank the Times for setting their sights on them just to gain some favor on the internet. 
&&I have no problem with this. Disney doesn't owe it to the LA Times or any newspaper a private screening.

It is ridiculous.&&when a company gets this petty you know its being run by a pile of asswads right?&&This is the problem with access journalism, it requires access.  Big news media companies want to be invited to Disney’s party promoting Disney’s new thing but also say “we have real journalists out there uncovering bad stuff”.  Tough to have both.  Unfortunately the investigative, adversarial  journalism is often far less lucrative than the access journalism.  I personally believe there’s been something of an awakening that large corporations and even the government can end the access whenever they want, and so journalists are moving back towards adversarial investigation.  So - this post about Disney and the LA times makes me happy.  It means some journalist somewhere is doing their job.  I’ll still go see Thor (which is a whole other issue), and I don’t need the LA Times to have been at the screening to tell me what they thought.  I’d rather have them running down scummy corrupt politics.

Presumably because Disneyland and the massive, massive tourism it draws throughout the year provides such business and activity for the city proper that they consider the cost worth it. &&I may be confused by the article, but further down it talks about how this was paid for by financing from the city of $510 million, which will be paid back with $1.1 billion in interest. I don't understand the $1 a year thing, but it sounds like the city is actually getting return on their investment.
&&I'd say it's a pretty sweet deal - for the city.

""About 30,600 people work at Disneyland Resort, accounting for nearly 19% of Anaheim’s jobs, based on a recent city report. The Anaheim Resort District, which includes two Disney theme parks, the convention center and dozens of hotels, is expected to account for $171.9 million in tax revenue during the fiscal year that ends next June — or 43% of general fund revenue.

According to the company, in 2016 Disneyland Resort “paid more than $125 million in taxes, bonds, levies, fees and contracts, directly benefiting Anaheim, its residents and local schools.”

Disney has also taken steps to unburden Anaheim: Since 1992, the company has paid the city for police service at its resort property, and has done the same for fire and paramedic service since 2000; those contracts now generate more than $10 million a year for the city.""&&Anaheim also has tons of hotels and restaurants that get a boost from Disney being nearby, so it's not like the city is getting completely screwed.&&How much money do you think the surrounding area earns because Disney is there? Think about it
&&Taxes on $35mil is probably pretty significant. Especially considering California is all about taxes. &&Don't be fooled. The city makes revenue. Off of these types of deals. Workers get jobs. The city economy is boosted as people flock there to spend money on housing, food, lodging, fuel etc. I guarantee you the city didn't do this at a loss. Every city makes these types of deals. 
They weighed the cost vs the revenue brought in. Now the city wants more? Why? .... because they realize Disney is making way more than the city is off the deal.  

Don't make the deal if your not happy with it. It's that simple. They agreed to the deal. 

I guarantee you that if they could go back they would still make the deal. Why? Because some profit is better than no profit. 

Think of it small scale like a county fair that hires an amusement company to come in and offer rides. The amusement company agrees to come if the county provides the electricity, water, space, security etc at no cost. People flock to the fair but spend way more riding the rides than going to the grandstand concerts, tractor pulls, demolition dirty, etc. The county commission realizes that the amusement company is making the most money off the revenue of the fair. So the county complains that the amusement company should lease the space, pay for the enormous electrical bill and split the cost of the security. The county commission argues that these lost profits could help the struggling county pay off its other bills. They want the amusement company to pony up more cash. The amusement company says no. The amusement company knows the county couldn't possibly find someone else to come in at a better deal. Besides the county is making profit off the amusement company who is the larger economic draw. With out the amusement company the revenue would be much lower. 

So who's the bad guy.... the amusement company or the county commission? 

Each side in every deal is going to work to get the best deal that they can. All the city is trying to do here is get a better deal. But they should be very careful  not to scare off their biggest revenue maker. 

Ask Detroit or Flint how this worked out for them with GM.

Thank you for sharing your experience. &&The cast members who made that happen make minimum wage.  Most of them love their job and don't do it for the money.

People are acting like the entire world doesn't work this way. If you stand up to your boss, don't expect a promotion. The LA Times wasn't invited to see a movie screening, boo hoo.

Disney has every right to screen their movie to whoever they want, just as the LA Times has the right to write articles about whatever they want. Why are people getting triggered?&&They're not complaining that their reporting cost them an advance screening. If anything, that's a badge of honor and means they won't play nice just to avoid losing access.

But it's worth pointing out since it's not just that they weren't invited; it's that they were specifically *disinvited,* purposefully singled out to be excluded. That means they have to explain to readers why literally every other publication has a review out for days or weeks and they do not.&&[deleted]&&Except that's exactly what they're doing now in 2017&&Why can't they?&&""Lemme just ignore these blatant corporate bullying tactics cause I love the feel of mickey's dick in my ass"".

It's still a win win. &&Having been to Anaheim several times I can say that there has been several thousand of my dollars that went into non Disney Anaheim businesses that otherwise wouldn’t have.

&&This is the same line of bullshit sports team owners use when getting stadiums built for them by the public.  It never pans out for the public and the owners make out like bandits.

Likewise I have been to a few islands in the Caribbean and been to lush resorts.  You'd think all that money funneling coming to the islands would see the locals doing pretty well.  They don't.  More often than not you drive past squalor on the way to the nice resort.

Just another form of ""trickle down"" economics.  It doesn't work.&&And Disneyland also benefits from being in sunny and safe Anaheim, CA.... they wouldn't make as much money if they were in bumblefuck, Oklahoma. 

It is mutually beneficial relationship between town and the companies that reside there. So why are the towns/states letting companies that reside there extort them out of millions of dollars?&&That’s disgusting &&As I understood it, the CITY owes $1.1 billion in interest for financing several infrastructure projects, one of which is the garage. Disney only owes $1 per year for the garage's lease, and what's more, Disney gets ownership of the garage once the city pays its $1.1 billion debt in full. The reason Disney would receive ownership of the garage only after the debt is paid off is so if the debt *isn't* paid, Anaheim gets sued instead of Disney.

Whether the city is receiving a reasonable return on investment from business and money coming into the city that wouldn't if Disney weren't there is another question, but the article seems to suggest they almost certainly aren't.&&> this was paid for by financing from the city of $510 million

Anaheim took out a loan. 

> will be paid back with $1.1 billion in interest

A really bad loan.   This isn’t what Disney is paying the city. It’s the end price the city is paying. &&Unfortunately, no. Issuing the bonds means the city takes on the debt. That $510m was basically the cost of building the ""Anaheim resort district"" which besides the parking structure included repairing and redesigning all the major streets/sidewalks in the area around the resort.

The parking structure is the only part that is going to be transferred to Disney ownership at the end, but it's still a sweet deal considering how much money they make off of it

Disney's argument is the later part of the article:

>According to the company, in 2016 Disneyland Resort “paid more than $125 million in taxes, bonds, levies, fees and contracts, directly benefiting Anaheim, its residents and local schools.”

That adds up to billions of dollars in taxes by the time the bonds mature in 2036, so, I'm sure that's why Disney sees the agreements as fair.

It's interesting to note that recently, the owner of the Angels (Arte Moreno) demanded a similar $1-per-year lease to develop all the land around Angel Stadium, which the city also owns, and he was shut down by Mayor Tait and the city counci.&&So.... let's see if we can get that lease down to 50 cents.&&Yep.

Those FTEs also never leave because it's really a good company to work for even though the pay isn't great compared to true IT companies.

Why pay for something yourself when you can get taxpayers to pay for it instead while the corp rakes in all the money! &&This right here ^^ if I recall correctly City of Anaheim built the existing parking structure, rents it to Disney for $1/yr, and Disney takes all the parking revenue for themselves. Add to that, on the eve of Star Wars land announcement Disney lobbied hard to get Anaheim to vote to extend a 30yr agreement for Anaheim to not impose any new taxes on the park, holding “new Disney Anaheim development” over their head. — what I’m saying is that Anaheim has supported Disney a LOT. This backlash is more so the pendulum swinging back to gain some equilibrium.

I love Disney and I think the city should support them. But the way Disney goes about things is underhanded, opaque, and strong arm in my opinion.

But from what I gathered from this thread they exposed the higher up's from Disney in doing something bad.

I think the outrage is not only because Disney was caught doing something bad, but the guy's who did the catching (which we'll call good) are being punished by Disney because they know they got caught doing something bad.

I don't think the issue here is that they do/don't have the right to not let them view Ragnarok.  But because of how big Disney's muscles actually are.

On an unrelated note: as a lifelong star wars fan I was excited when Disney purchased the right for the Star Wars IP, because I knew they would do something with it as opposed to Lucas doing nothing.  At this point I'm horrified how hard they're whoring out the whole franchise with the whole star wars land idea.&&You don't want a world where corporations don't at least fear bad PR.&&I don't give a flying fuck if the world works this way. Doesn't make it right.&&Which pretty much everyone will forget as soon as Thor Ragnarok has a record breaking weekend due to an insanely well reviewed movie and the lack of pretty much anything else in theaters.&&Honestly man they'll win too. They'll strike better deals maybe with the larger more profitable (mostly urban) ones that have a bit more leverage, but they have all the power here and they know it. They'll lose virtually no business (because consumers at the end of their day like their content more than they dislike their behavior), and will have even more leverage once they launch their online platform and start doing same day releases of all their movies on demand (probably offer a la carte but at a price that might make it worth a monthly subscription).

Not saying it's right or wrong, but if I were Disney that's the strategy I would probably be pursuing as well, theaters are a dying distribution medium that for factors largely out of their control have become too expensive and too much of a hassle relative to their home entertainment competitors outside of the occasional splashy event film. Disney's ran by people much smarter than me, they know which way the wind's blowing, and how much leverage they have relative to the risk of doing any of it.

Way of the world, hope their servers don't suck.&&Yeah...like how much could their product be worth in all the parks forever compared to that kind of immense brand association/recognition.

The businesses near Disneyland get so much of their money from having the park there. 

I bet that 7-11 rakes in the cash. Haha. THE 7-11 to end all 7-11's.

The hotels, all the sit down restaurants and fast food. The Anaheim convention center too probably. 

It's a tricky situation is what I'm saying. Anaheim isn't the best city, but they most definitely benefit from Disney being where it's at.

Edit: Yeah, I shouldn't have used stadiums as an example, because Disney probably helps WAY more than any stadium ever would. It's not like driving to the game and going home. Disney is like a destination, with a ton of middle class families looking to have fun and spend a lot of money. And socal residents get a decent deal at disney too I believe. Cheaper for them.

Disney is in its own league for family vacationing probably. It's not like Knotsberry down the street, which has a different clientele in some ways.&&While I agreed on the stadium, Disneyland is a bit different in that it has year round attendance, 365 days a year. Where as the stadium is only packed for a quarter of the Sundays every year and then some for a few other events.

 Pretty sure the city would be worse off without a Disney presence. The surrounding area (non Disney) employs thousands upon thousands of people and brings in millions I'm taxes a year just by association with Disneyland.

When the stage managers unionized, they were basically strong-armed during negotiations into just about the same low wage but with even more restrictions. Then a specific group of performers tried to unionize due to conditions getting continually worse, and the company reacted pretty dramatically. There were daily announcements against it, and after the union was voted in, Disney started to take away shifts from everyone involved and basically said ""well, it's because you unionized"". The union then sued Disney and they backed off, but before the contract could be completed Disney cancelled their show and forced them to take a terrible wage because if the contract had not been agreed on by the show's end, it would have fallen apart. (as they were told anyway). It was a huge mess and this is just the bare bones of it, but it was awful for the people involved. &&so no actual answers?&&WDW is super unionized. Like, union as balls. So maybe they mean DL?

source: briefly worked at WDW&&I’ve known people who spent their lifetime working there, and people who did the Disney College Program and end up staying there. People see it as a legitimate career option. It’s a fun place and a fun environment, really. It’s honestly unlike any job I’ve ever had simply because it never feels like you’re working, and you feel like you’re part of something bigger.&&Honestly that’s one of the perks working there. Getting laid is so easy. It was the College Program after all so the party scene was pretty up there. My best memory is probably doing a line of coke off Princess Elena’s tits.&&Sure, but if Disney was ""pure draconian"" they wouldn't allow that. &&It's pretty cool for sure, I loved the random rain storms while eating, but Star Wars in real life vs rainforest cafe? I think we know which one people care more about.

I know that the cafe space will be used for a parking garage, but I'm sure they decided years ago that this was going to happen at the same time star wars land was being designed.&&ESPN zone on the other hand... I think I'd rather have a parking lot. &&I remember going to the rainforest cafe as a child when we went on holiday to Disneyland. My parents picked up a set of green rainforest mugs , this must of been at least 12-13 years ago, and they are still in excellent condition. Good quality stuff. &&When I heard this reported the story mentioned that these venues might return inside of the new hotel&&I've been there.

there used to be one in the mall near my house. It was so fucking cool when I was a kid, closed down quite some time ago though

There's a story I have from some years ago when I worked for Costco: Coca-Cola was trying to raise the price point on their soda at Costco. Costco said NO - as raising the price point meant their members would be paying more and they don't like the do that. Coca-Cola threatened to pull their products from Costco. Costco returned that threat by removing Coca-Cola from all their warehouses, meanwhile still continuing to use Pepsi products. It took only a matter of weeks for Coca-Cola to buckle and agree to keep the price point the same...the power of Costco lol!

A similar incident happened with Apple and Costco.&&And they even sell the bottles on the vending machines for cheap &&Yeah it is definitely Anaslime.  I've never heard Anacrime but I guess that works too since it's close to anal cream.  &&*We took this trip to Garbage Grove/smells like Pluto inside the van, oh yeah/this ain't no funky Disney party, $5 at the door*&&I used to live on west and Chapman.

It’s mainly from all the shit on the sidewalk. &&[deleted]&&Oh yeah that was part of the plan, they used a bunch of shell companies to buy the swampy Central FL land. They didn't want word to get out that a fancy corporation like Disney was buying all the land. Then the land owners would raise their prices. &&> Yeah. I live in CFL and the Reedy Creek Improvement District is 3 times the size of the actual city of Orlando... and owned and governed entirely by Disney.

Reedy Creek seems to be about 38.6 Square Miles, and the city of Orlando is 113 Square miles. It's big but I think you got it mixed up the other way around. &&They used shell companies so the sellers wouldn't know ""Disney wants to buy every parcel in this area, if you hold out for more money they'll be forced to pay it"". The idea wasn't to create a massive conspiracy that the government couldn't unravel, it was to prevent the land sellers from knowing they could essentially extort Disney for any amount of money because they *needed* their property.&&Don't you mean Reedy Creek? &&You think Disney would abandon the infrastructure it spent over 60 years and billions of dollars creating?  I don't think so, they may  have chosen to put more money in Orlando rather then Anaheim but I find it hard to believe they would stop investing in Anaheim altogether.    &&I don't think it's reasonable for any city to spend 108m on any private entity. They should build a good city and businesses should choose their locations on merits and not hand outs.&&> There are 100 other municipalities in the LA metro area that Disney *could have* build in instead

Emphasis on the *past tense.* It's already built. It's not like Disney is going to pick up and move Disneyland to another city now, it's not like a sports team where they can convince the other city to literally pay to build them a stadium/theme park... Or maybe they can. But as far as we know Disney isn't really interested in leaving the LA area.&&sure but that's a race to the bottom. nobody wins except plutocracy. so ""that's just the way it is"" is unacceptable&&There is zero chance of them moving. This is not a stadium that gets old you just build a new one. Its a theme park that they invested billions of dollars in every decade. Its pretty much locked to the land. Stuff like this new garage has to go as close as it can reasonable go to the park because you have to transport guest from the garage to the park.&&But the people Disney paid off DISAGREE with the articles calling out their corruption.&&The economic return of stadiums isn't very good, if there is any at all.

It's the reason I'm happy San Diego didn't cave and build another stadium for the chargers.&&Almost every time I go to Disneyland I eat at either the Denny's or Ihop accross the street.&&There's also only one Disneyland (well, two, kinda), so it attracts from literally all over the world. Sports teams are littered throughout the country, so you're only attracting a small geographic area. &&> Where as the stadium is only packed for a quarter of the Sundays every year and then some for a few other events.

Also concerts, and virtually anything else they can get there in the off season. They get every damn dollar out of the stadium, and it's still not really worth it for the city. If the city actually got some of the revenue to make up for the money invested, maybe...&&Last time I went to Disneyland, I walked from my hotel to the house of blues and saw a middle aged homeless man yelling at his penis on the way.

So they're paying back more than 3x what they borrowed.&&Oh yeah, believe me, myself and every Angels fan I know was pissed about the name change, and so were Dodgers fans.

Arte's last bluff was building a new stadium on the former Marine Corp Air Station, which is a joke, because that land was just developed into a bunch of suburban neighborhoods and shopping centers, and the city council flat out told him they have zero money and wouldn't put up a dime.&&That's because they used ""www."" instead of ""en."" used for Wikipedia.

Disney stepped in and said that if they didn't play the force awakens at that one location instead, they would pull the force awakens from all of their theaters. Basically extortion. &&http://variety.com/2015/film/news/quentin-tarantino-disney-extortion-star-wars-hateful-eight-1201663184/#!&&i choose to believe this is true. cognitive biases be hecked! legit got a chuckle out of me&&[deleted]&&I haven't felt much of anything since my gueina pig died...&&I have never worked a 90 hour work week while at Disney.&&From what I've heard that's normal practice for all animation studios&&Uh, having worked at one of those places, they have the most pro-employee work environments you could ever imagine, in almost every way.  There's a pretty powerful just-world fallacy at play whenever you see people assume that Google or FB must treat their employees like shit.  Every time I would tell someone I worked there, their first  question was ""do you really get Perk X, Perk Y, Perk Z?!?!?!"" and their second statement (not question) would be ""they work you like a dog though"".  On the work/life balance side, I worked exactly as much as I felt like working (<40 hrs per week), including taking random days off with little notice and working during the hours that fit my life. This obviously gets harder as you advance in the organization and need to spend more time wrangling people, but the point is that you're largely judged on your productivity and you pretty much get to pick the level of productive you want to be, instead of some archaic notion of ""number of hours butt was in seat"".

Interesting. &&Worked at Disneyland a few years ago, I was union. && Right but some people actually have to get paid for their work if they have a future/family. &&Sure, I can agree with that. I think it's fair to say that while Disney has some really shady/unethical business practices, calling them draconian is definitely an exaggeration. And the exaggeration of those practices doesn't do much good when debating the issues that actually exist within their model. It creates the room for people to correct the disinformation, which only aids in legitimizing the company, rather than actually pointing out the things they do wrong that are morally ambiguous or worse. &&> but Star Wars in real life vs rainforest cafe?

Could be hearsay, but I grew up in FL and how Disney purchased the land in Orlando was always a topic of discussion &&Well technically Reedy Creek is the district, but the location is Lake Buena Vista.&&The subsidies are generally for new projects, not for maintaining their current facilities. They aren't going to move the original park, but they could stop expanding in Anaheim and instead expand more at their other locations or build entirely new locations.&&Most of the corporate welfare goes back to the late 80s when Disneyland was around 35, it was just a park half the size of Florida's with one hotel and a big parking lot. The area around the park had always been ticky-tacky sleazy and annoyed Walt Disney to no end, which is why in Florida they bought enough land to buffer their illusions from the intrusions of Holiday Inns and the like.  
To build on their Anaheim property, Disney had to pay to have high tension power line towers removed among other things. It wasn't cheap. The company briefly considered other options: it owned the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose in Long Beach when it acquired The Wrather Corporation for the Disneyland Hotel, and Knott's Berry farm north on the freeway has a pretty good land footprint when you include it's main park, water park, replica buildings, etc.  
Anaheim wanted Disney to build in the neighborhood they despised, so they gave them incentives to do so. As a result, Disneyland went from one single park that wasn't even open seven days a week in the mid 80s to a two-park complex with one (soon two) additional hotels and a shopping center. Mostly because this was all built on the huge surface level parking lot any visitor over 30 can remember.&&Anaheim and it’s local economy has reaped far more from tourism dollars and sales tax than the 108 million it spent. The city of Anaheim has its own sales tax which is tacked onto the county and state tax. I believe it’s 1.5%.

That 108m has been made many many times over by now. It was a financially sound decision.&&The thing is your acting as if all cities would band together to say fuck you disney.

You only need to find one county, city etc. That is willing to say, we're cool with that.

How many businesses in the local area make money off tourists every year coming into the area.&&> I don't think it's reasonable for any city to spend 108m on any private entity.

I'm betting you don't approve of all the ""sweetheart deals"" given to pro-sports teams either....&&Can we talk about how major sports arenas are funded?&&A theme park has better returns because its game day 365 days of the year there and through out the day. Rather then a stafium where they have 10 home games a year and then most of it sits empty drawing no one but its employees.&&I am, as always, on the fence.

One, because the dollars actually generated aren't easily traced and it makes it very easy to say one way or another. What I can say, is what I've seen personally.

Back in the 70s and 80s, downtown Indianapolis was a shit hole. Businesses were leaving for more lucrative locations, there was no decent retail, entertainment, or really any decent districts. Companies were moving operations to the outer city, or just out of the city period. The transportation industry has always been strong here, due to its prime location for shipments crossing the country.

The rehabilitation of the city very and truly started with the building of the Hoosier (later RCA) Dome in downtown Indianapolis area and the move that brought the Colts here in 1984. It brought with it a lot of investments that helped rehab the city zoo to be one of the best around, it helped bring the Eiteljorg Museum to life, it helped make the Indianapolis Children's Museum even better, and so on. 

Along with it was a common add-on to stadiums, the Convention Center. These early investments led to an invigorated economy, which led to the Circle Center mall, a very popular bar district, lots of restaurants, and brought businesses back to the city. The building of Lucas Oil Stadium, and remodeling of the Convention Center, along with previous additions, like Victory Field for the AAA Indians, Conseco (now Bankers Life) Fieldhouse for the Pacers, and downtown Indianapolis is a pretty cool city to visit. It's not Chicago or New York, of course, but it has its own life again.

It can be argued that all that could have happened without the Colts, but it was definitely a huge incentive that breathed life back into a dying city. &&Hockey in Arizona is probably the WORST possible example...  I frankly think that San Diego would have benefited from the stadium, as at the time they would have been given every fourth Superbowl game.&&Yeah I shouldn't have used that analogy because I'm aware of the stadium controversies. I think a theme park like Disney DOES make bank for surrounding businesses though. It's not like driving to the game and going home.&&[deleted]&&To be fair you can find that in most of our beautiful golden state &&That guy was actually an employee of Disneyland.

He's the main driver of the entire thing.&&The US government just needs to make it so that corporations have to pay in order to keep their intellectual property out of public domain. That way they can hold on to the shit that matters while allowing dormant properties to still enter the public domain.

Companies keeping onto shit they don't actually use for almost a century for free is absurd. &&Nah it’s that everything made before 1923 is in the public domain. Plenty of stuff has entered the public domain since 1923. But I do agree with you that Disney can fuck right off with their extensions. 

Statutory law can be a bitch &&> Nothing's entered the public domain in the US since 1923.

Nothing at all? Or nothing of Disney's?&&Most definitely. I just want to assume we live in a society that's a little more empathetic.&&This is incorrect.

Disney had a contract to show Force Awakens at that location *before* Tarantino (in fact, people had purchased tickets to Star Wars long before Tarantino had ever booked his movie in the theater), and the theater double-booked the movies. Tarantino threw a bit of a fit because he had his heart set on that specific theater (because he filmed in a very specific film format that could only play at a handful of locations across the country), and everyone accused Disney of bullying because Reddit hates Disney and trips over itself to bootlick Tarantino.

Which is why I'm half-inclined to look for the inevitable comment in this thread where someone explains how it's not really an outrage.

So far as I know, none of the 100 other municipalities have existing Disney locations that they could have expanded to instead. Nor do I really see much value in building a new park from scratch, or abandoning the Southern California market.&&God I love Knott's Berry Farm. $20 bucks with unlimited parking for 5-6 months and no more payments for the entire year. No blackout dates except the Halloween events. Better than paying the $20 plus parking and blackout dates? Eh. I'll wait until star wars land is built &&Probably a hotel room tax as well?

Edit: yup 15%. &&> * Anaheim agreed in 1996 to issue $510 million in bonds to finance various infrastructure improvements, the expansion of the Anaheim Convention Center and the construction of the $108.2-million Mickey & Friends parking structure, which Disney needed for California Adventure and other projects. When the 40-year bonds, which include roughly $1.1 billion in interest, are paid off, Anaheim will transfer ownership of the garage to Disney. Meanwhile, the company pockets the parking revenue.

So that's 108.2m+198m interest. Then the split profits lost. And then the building goes to them too, not that they don't already effectively own it anyways with a $1 lease. Shit, it's better than owning it, no property taxes.

EDIT: And this is all assuming they wouldn't have payed for the building and land on their own. They were and are completely capable of paying for it and just the parking revenue alone would make up and then a ton more. This was an expansion, not a whole new park. It's not like it's financially feasible to abandon a fully built theme park and build a whole new park somewhere outside of Anaheim boundaries just because you're not getting 100-300m+ worth of corporate welfare. That would probably be tens of billions, talk about cutting off the nose to spite the face.&&Wait wait wait
So this 1.5% tax is added onto the sales tax and county tax further increasing the total tax?
Or is their total tax a measly 1.5%?

To further add to that question, if the 1.5% other tax is added onto everything else, what is that money used for? &&Probably not, and no reason they should&&Also depends on the stadium and how effective the owners are at booking it. Basketball stadiums are especially good at booking out because any mid-range musical artist can book an NBA stadium and at least fill the 100 level and the floor. My local NBA stadium only seats 16k max for concerts, and if you rope off the top level that number drops even more. So if you look at that size venue, I would guess that they book solid, where a 80k capacity NFL stadium has a much harder time trying to book non-football events. 

Since we're talking about Anaheim, an Angels Stadium employee once told me that they have something happening every day of the year. If there's not an actual event scheduled on a particular day, it's because they're setting up for an event the next day. If the baseball team is on the road, they might have a concert while they're gone. In the off-season, they have stuff ranging from Supercross to concerts to the Harvest Crusade to high school football championship games. They pretty much make sure that there is no time where the stadium is sitting empty. &&Far point. Comparing a theme park to a stadium in that case is comparing apples and oranges.&&This is a really interesting point. I did some cursory research because I don't just believe what random people say on the internet (no offense). Indy's Wikipedia page lead me to this documentary (http://video.wfyi.org/video/2282207842/) about how Indy revitalized itself by trying to become a sports-centered city.

Now this is in contrast to, for example, Marlins Stadium in Miami, which has been very costly to the city of Miami (http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/economic-time-machine/article1946635.html).

I guess the take-away point is sports stadiums can help the local economy if planned properly in the city's long term interests. It seems, however, that many of these cities are bullied into making short-term decisions that don't pan out for their long term growth.&&There was basically no compromise with the Chargers, the city had already bent over backwards several times to keep them (e.g. buying all their unsold tickets) and the ROI on a new stadium made absolutely no sense for the taxpayer when added up. SD is already a huge, diverse city that doesn't need a football team for economic activity. It was pretty much emotional blackmail on the citizens to keep their team in exchange for a massive corporate handout.

Fuck the Chargers.&&I live in San Francisco... is that nor normal? &&I sincerely hope you mean patents but at the same time, don't change it back. &&Copyright, not patent.&&Yea screw Disney, just allowing their patients to end up all over public domains. I’m glad I didn’t go to any Disney hospitals. Then I’d be in the public domain.&&[deleted]&&I thought Obama's roving death squads were solely responsible for allowing patients to expire.  And you mean copyrights, not patents.&& You dare mess with *The House of Mouse?*&&[Just ask the Jonas Brothers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF4_4g1B2Ug)&&He was just the 'legitimate' artist/politician they used to put a face on it. The forces at play here are much bigger than Sonny 'look out for that tree' Bono&&I couldn't get behind that. They could indefinitely pay to keep it. It would mean that everyone who doesn't have the money can't keep things out of the PD. 

It would be better to have classifications of copyright. classifications in which extends copyright into certain categories.

For example, as long a Disney is producing new content for such a copyright it continues the copyright until they stop. Once in the PD, copyright cannot be reclaimed. This would force them to create actual new content in an area. If they want to keep mickey, they would need to create new mickey content, not just produce physical items for it. &&Yeah, there are maintenance fees on patents, no good reason they couldn't put them on copyright.&&Don't mind if I do!&&Don't mind if I do!

(I'm mostly joking about the latter, it doesn't bother me _that_ much)&&When I was <10 I had this three prong plug and all of the outlets were two prongers.

And Disney acquired ESPN in 1996, exactly 21 years ago.  &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I got the microwave &&Well it kind of is. Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake are the cities that the whole resort falls into. Disney actually controls both of them. &&Generally sales tax a combo of state, county, and city tax. Where I live I pay like 8% sales tax, that's, I believe, 5% state, 2% county, 1% city.  While the big (relatively) city in my county pays 9%.&&The tax numbers are in the article. The city makes more than that $108 million from Disney *every year*&&Ya. Angels Stadium is really good about that. I know they also do quite a few college graduations. I think they also did monster trucks a few times too. The Pond also seems really active. There always seems to be concerts or something there.&&Pretty much. Theme parks tend to be amazing for the local economy. Ask Orlando or Sandusky. Those cities basically run on theme parks.&&I'll absolutely jump on board that these lease deals are way too slanted for the teams. For example, the Colts receive 48% of the gross profit off concessions, including a $3.5 million dollar annually for non-Colts events. They don't run the concessions outside of setting the prices. The city outsources the management of it. 

But when done with planning and the goals, like Indianapolis did, it works. 

Like you said, though, Indianapolis planned and devised to be a sports city. They brought the NCAA headquarters, the Colts, have the Pacers, and a triple A baseball team. 

And they used those to generate and create a decent city with a nice downtown area for visitors. 



&&Yup it still made some sense as is. This is sad. &&yeah i've personally always wanted to claim a body so i'm just gonna go wait in front of a hospital until they shovel the newest freshly expired ones out on the street for us to nab.&&I sincerely hope you meant that you hope he meant copyright, because Disney doesn't lobby about patent law at all, it's copyright, and they are major fucking assholes about it.  They stole the public domain, which again, has nothing to do with patents. &&No no, they said *patients*. Basically, before Disney effected the copyright extensions, they would keep terminally ill, suffering artists alive against their will, never allowing them to expire. This was done to make sure the copyright of their works would not enter the public domain.&&It's awful, what kind of Mickey Mouse operation are they running there?&&To put some context to it, I lot of Disney's most famous movies are based on public domain property. So they have benefited greatly from the pool of expired patents, but they have refused to add anything to it.  
 
To just name a few DIsney movies based on public domain property:  
* Alice in Wonderland  
* Cinderella  
* Snow White  
* Sleeping Beauty
* Aladdin  
* Around the World in 80 Days  
* Beauty and the Beast  
* Frozen  
* Bug’s Life  
* Chicken Little  
* Hercules  
* Little Mermaid  

There are at least 50 Disney movies in total based on public domain. Check out this [Forbes article.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/derekkhanna/2014/02/03/50-disney-movies-based-on-the-public-domain/#11276fbc329c)&&An attempt to prevent monopolies on ideas/inventions/fictional universes. Basically if you invented it, you were set for a lifetime, but now if you invent something and a company takes over it and you're dead the lifetime gone, they say they still own it and control all of it.

Things entering public domain allow for creativity and expansion upon previous works. Disney essentially did this though to maintain all control, forever.

It's not just Disney either, a lot of material is being controlled and never released, anything from simple creative works to technology and medicine. Disney has just been a bit of a spearhead in all these corporate shenanigans 

Edit: To clarify the danger here is not '1 individual forever owning his own work' its companies and corporations, entities that aren't 1 person claiming ownership over patents and forever extending these. It essentially allows these corporations to monopolize on ideas and knowledge by just essentially collecting the patents.&&> if the owner still actively uses it?

Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse. Walt Disney also died 50 years ago.&&The owner of the copyrights in this case would be Walt Disney who has been dead for decades.  The original laws for copyrights gave the CREATOR sole rights for their creation which they could assign to someone else; these rights last until death of the creator and then plus, I think 15-20 years after to allow the creator to reap the full benefits of their work. What Disney Co. has been doing is lobbying to extend that death period every time Walt Disney's copyrights would expire.

The idea is that the creator of a work DOES have full rights for as long as it will benefit him personally, but also recognizes that the rights can't stay for all time; it's better for society as a whole that at some point other people can work with at least some of the ideas that were put out there by the creator to assist in their own creations. For example, pretty much every Disney animated movie is taken from a story in the public domain. 

Allowing ideas in the public domain allows people to create their own interpretations and twists on things. &&Because the idea that you ""own"" or control how an idea is used is a completely artificial construct designed to foster creativity and investment in to intellectual property. Making copy right terms arbitrarily long perverts a system designed for the common good. &&> Can somebody explain to me why any particular material should become public domain if the owner still actively uses it?

Here's a better question, why should we as a public allow the government to enforce an artificial restriction on the normal human behavior of sharing ideas and information?  And is the way they are doing it now actually beneficial to society as a whole?

But to answer your question, copyright restricts culture.  The entire reason for copyright to exist in the first place is specifically to grow the public domain.  The idea of copyright was to let people profit from it and thereby encourage people to create and share.  The notion was that by giving them a time limited monopoly they could make some money before the creation becomes part of society's collective ""library.""  Copyright is a perversion of nature, but hey, these guys also thought slavery was ok too.

Today, there are plenty of incentives to create and share without the need for a government enforced artificial monopoly.

Watch out for that tree!&&I feel like any legislation would include ""as long as new merchandise is created, that counts towards keeping it out of the public domain""&&The problem is, they can easily produce a 10 second video with mickey mouse and claim they've made new content this decade. If that is not good enough, they can make a 2 hour video that is complete and utter garbage for the same result. You don't want people to pay to extend copyright, but by paying to make new content they are still paying for extensions.

Why should a product enter the public domain? Does creating new content undermine that argument? &&This is the best solution. Also good for abandonware &&This is the best solution. Also good for abandonware &&Being able to pay to indefinitely keep it is kind of the idea. The thing about a company as big as Disney is that even though they have a shitload of cash, they have ownership of so many intellectual properties that trying to pay for all of them would not be a good idea. 

Alright. Because I have put way too much thought into this, here's a plan I came up with like four or five years ago. In order to keep your intellectual property out of public domain, you would only need to pay a percentage of what the IP is worth. Say... .1%

For example, take Mickey Mouse, the whole reason for this mess. And because I don't know how much Mickey Mouse is actually worth let's just say that he's worth about, I dunno, $5 Billion. 

Under this rule, the Walt Disney Corporation would need to pay the US government about $5 Million every year or so to keep Old Mick' out of the public domain. 

For another example, let's take Duke Nukem, and because I also don't know how much Duke is worth let's just say he's worth $6 Million. Under the same rule, Gearbox Software would need to pay the US government around $30K in order to keep the Duke out of public domain.

This would allow both large and small companies to maintain the rights to their intellectual properties as long as they wish, but as I said in my original post, would allow dormant properties that aren't renewed to enter the public domain. 

Remember, as copyright law currently stands, these corporations are able to keep all of this shit *for free*.

And it would also give the US government a new revenue source for shit like schools, repairing our crumbling infrastructure, national parks or other cool shit.

There is no way this problem is *this* widespread without there having been reports before now. I think it would set off *more* red flags if a woman/man came in filing a complaint and then backed out a week or so later, then another person, unconnected and unrelated to the first, comes in with a similar complaint on the same exec/actor/director and they too back out and ""drop the charges"". 

Wouldn't that indicate that the person is doing something wrong and then, through likely nefarious means, is shutting the people up?

Basically, as I understand it, this was a result of China's one child policy.  Well for this reason most couples preferred boys, since they carry on the family name, tend to (statistically) make more money than girls, and for other cultural reasons.  Well, these couples didn't give birth to a girl, and just give up.  They'd keep trying for a boy, and just never registering the birth of any girls, and only registering the eventual (if ever) boy.

Edit: people seem to think I'm dismissing every other report. I'm not. I'm saying the last report was in 2005, twelve years ago. This means that either he's started finding people who consent to what he wants to do, or he's stopped. Parks & Rec started in 2009. This would mean that he was still doing it at least then.

By coincidence they were driving down a street when these women were yelling for 2pac because he was on the same street. They pulled up beside him and fired into the vehicle. This is corroborated by eye witness accounting including the uncle of the shooter, who also goes corroborates subsequent events that are generally unknown to the public. Anderson's uncle who was in the car was a childhood acquaintance of Suge Knight, they looked directly at each other during the shooting. Knight tells police he knows the people. The LAPD and LVPD investigated all of it and it's a de facto closed case. It's ""unsolved"" because the crime scene was contaminated like fuck, the assailant is dead, not enough physical evidence, and because it's good entertainment. It's run of the mill gang violence that happens every day.

> They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. “And then he really did it,” Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. “He proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.”

EDIT: As a lot of people have noted, information have been left out and it seems that the women involved didn't exactly tried to stop the incident, nor did they simply leave.&&I don't think it's true that he asked for consent every time—for example the call with Abby Schachner where she hears him masturbating during their conversation. No mention of asked consent there.

Anyway, the standard should be a direct consensually expressed 'yes', not the absence of 'no'. &&But he wasn't particularly famous at the time &&this is bullshit. Weinstein *raped* women. 

As well by your definition, no man with money or fame can ever have sex again because he has to fear that the consent he obtained after asking is tainted with someone thinking that he's going to ruin them.

That, is ultimate bullshit. 

Weinstein actively threatened women and they very often stood up to him. And he did try to follow up on his threats. 

Louis CK didn't threaten anyone (EDIT: I'll add as far as we know at this point, with this ever growing scandal, who knows what will come out tomorrow, but so far, his behavior is really not what Weinstein engaged in).

Because someone reads an implied threat where there is none, doesn't mean that it's reasonable to believe it. Like, I could feel scared because a black guy is following me on the street. I could feel an implied threat. It's not fair to assume this just because he's black, in fact it would make me a racist. Whether or not I *feel* the threat has little to do with whether there *is* a threat. My *feelings* do not make *you* a perpetrator of what I *feel*. 

Your actions, and your *intentions* count. This is why murder and manslaughter are different charges with different punishments even though both can be from you being on the firing side of a gun and a dead guy on the other. Also it's why you can get charged with attempted murder though a gun never had any bullets in it. Your *intent* to kill is what gets you in trouble there.

By your rules, as soon as you're a CEO you're out of the dating market forever. If you're a politician, forget it. No sex for you because you have real connections to power. So everything you do is an implied threat. 

You can't even order breakfast because someone can say oh he's powerful, I better give this breakfast to him for free or else he's going to try to ruin me.

There *has* to be a *reasonable* belief behind it being a threat. Not just because he's connected or powerful. Any express threat, or any other reason to believe that he might act. Being a man, having money or power, is not any *reasonable* reason to believe that you will destroy someone's life or fuck with their job, any more than it's reasonable to believe that because a black guy is walking in a white neighborhood it's because he's there to steal something.

And to the best of my knowledge he hasn’t. 

I’m not saying what he did was right but it seems he listened and never did it again. People tend to forgive someone who does it once and learns from it and never repeats it more than someone who just keeps doing it. &&He went snake out.&&Worth mentioning is he got a stern warning from the network, saying doing what you did is not okay, do it again and you're fired.

But that was after a lot of pillow talk. 

If I was seriously into masturbating that would have to be a longer and serious *are you cool with this* talk, and that's only after we would have been dating for a while. &&[deleted]&&This is Reddit and it's someone who's very well liked here, so we're going to have a whole lot of people burying their head in the sand&&The Times conveniently left out the rest of what happened that Gawker reported on a few years ago when that first came out.  They nodded and gave him a thumbs up not thinking he would really do it. &&It later states ""they were laughing a screaming"" and continued to watch until he ejaculated on his stomach. That sounds like pretty active, consentual participation to me. &&There’s a long road from creepy  freak to rapist. Let’s keep that in mind as we make judgements. &&If a clear and concise verbal ""Yes""  is the only true form of consent, every sexual encounter I've had has either be me raping them or they were raping me. &&But can masturbating on the phone without saying anything even be considered illegal with or without consent its not like they can see through the phone or he's forcing them. I just don't see how you can call that accusation in particular sexual abuse.&&The two women ""laughed and screamed"" while he did it, which I think is a pretty solid example of a case where he's pretty sure they're okay with what's going on. If we're talking about sex, sure, I agree, you should be getting an expressed yes, but they're in his hotel room and they're watching him do something to himself. They could just leave. 

The phone call is total speculation on her part, and frankly, I feel he has every right to touch himself while on the phone with someone. He probably shouldn't, lol, but all she has to do is hang up if she feels uncomfortable, and he shouldn't have to get her consent to touch himself when she's not directly involved at all. 

The last two, one of them said no and he didn't do it and apologized for asking (though he was on set, and that's very inappropriate in a professional context) and the other did express consent and only afterwards was uncomfortable for having decided to agree. 

In none of those situations do I see him victimizing someone, and in ALL of them except the phone (where she's not even in the same fucking room with him, I mean come on) he asked for their expressed consent. With the producer/performer that he was working with who he propositioned just outside the set, that's not something you should do, but it certainly doesn't make him a sexual predator or anything close to it.

Edit: ""Seal"" to ""Sexual""&&Wasn't he fat then?&&Flaccid dicks are funny, erect dicks are sexual harassment.&&There wasn't anything sexual or threatening about his revelation. Not that people couldn't be offended. But it's not like he got her alone and exposed himself for sexual gratification. He did it on set for comedic effect. I've got to believe that a lot of the offense/fear comes from dehumanization and feeling unsafe.&&It was mutually beneficial so she allowed it.

Wait....&&No, it’s about context, quickly flashing your penis in an environment where you are already nude (for a scene) and surrounded by cast and crew is very different to privately inviting people up to your to your room alone and then jerking off at them.&&What's wrong with the helicopter?&&*It's not like he came out, surprised them, and then started helicoptering.*



Well now I'm disappointed &&I guess it’s about time for me to come out and discuss the time Buzz Lightyear tried to take me to infinity from behind. &&a few years ago there were several, though anonymous, stories from 30 Seconds To Mars groupies, recounting how they, being groupies, willingly had sex with him, but then he choked them, hurt them and didn't stop when they told him they were in pain. some of them were underage too, if memory serves.

obviously not sure if any of this is true, but there was talk. i stopped paying attention so i'm not sure if any more of such stories surfaced later.&&I think I've  read five or six blind item stories at this stage about how he invited underage girls backstage or to his room to either have sex with them or do fucked up shit with, not to mention passing on his STDs.&&Yeah dude, Syria is crazy.&&Nope. But have you heard about how I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico?&&This really kills me too. I love Louis and have been enjoying his comedy for a while now. I'm very interested in what will happen from here on out, but I can't forgive him for shit like this. It ruins his comedy and I no longer respect him as a person or a professional.  
It was always interesting to watch his show and know going in to it that he's obviously a pretty rich guy, so seeing him live an otherwise shitty/normal life on TV (I always felt it was semi-autobiographical because some of it is really raw and makes you feel for him) you kind of root for his character's success in the show. Now it feels like someone making jokes when they are telling a story when they realize at that moment they were doing something fucked up, so they come up with a joke to fill in the gap.&&Just look at Roy Moore... Guy is accused of having sex with a 14 year old when he was 32... That's fucked...

And already Republican supporters are trying to defend him, like that fucktwat Hannity that said ""Well it was consensual""

or another Republican that said ""Well, Mary (as in Jesus' mom) was a teenager..soo...."" Brietbart news said that him having sex witht he 14 year old was ok because ""he was romantic""

what the actual fuck! This asshole took advantage of a little girl in the most disgusting way, and people are like ""yeesh, get over it already. It's fine...""
&&Right?  All these other accusations were met with the appropriate amount of pitchforks.

But replace Jackie Chan with Louis Fan, Jackie Chan can have a cameo. And maybe JeeJa Yanin instead of Lucy Liu, since the latter doesn't have as extensive marital arts training. Though the former is Thai, she trained with Tony Jaa (Ong Bak) and has that heavier striking style that can contrast with Donnie Yen and Louis Fan emphasis on acrobatics and fluidity (Though Louis Fan is known more for his ""striking"" in cinema, he's shown to be very versatile and athletic.)&&[overheard by children and their parents on a mic system] I got a question about you morticians.

&&Additional: there's a clear power dynamic difference here.

In this scenario, if I understand it properly, Chris Pratt was an irregular cast member while Amy Poehler is the lead star and I would assume at least one of the major writers and creative forces behind the show.  Chris Pratt's career, at the time at least, was in her hands.  Not the other way around.&&Yup. Fun fact, he was ripped before that and would only get cast as the arrogant frat boy type that's supposed to be hated, so he intentionally got fat for the role as Andy on Parks and Rec because he wanted to do comedy. &&He was still attractive when fat, now he just smokin'&&Came here to say this. There's nothing inherently sexual about plain old nudity. Intent, context, and whether or not the act was directed ""at"" someone matters. 

A streaker at a soccer game isn't sexually harassing anyone. There's no sexual context, the act isn't directed at anyone, and the intent isn't there. You could argue that it's directed at the general audience in an exhibitionist way, which certainly earns a couple points on the ""sexual harassment"" checklist, but not nearly enough points to be like ""yup, sexual harasser right there!"" You have to have other factors involved.

I would argue that a homeless man masturbating by himself in the corner of a park is not necessarily ""sexually harassing"" anyone. Obviously, it's illegal, it is a sexual crime (lewd, indecent exposure, around minors, whatever laws might apply here), and there's a sexual context, but he's not directing it at anyone. If he's masturbating in a park while leering at a group of 14 year old girls, that's sexual harassment. There's intent, sexual context, and a subject the act is directed at.

If your roommate is taking a shower and you accidentally walk in, there's no sexual harassment. If your roommate is purposefully trying to get you to ""walk in on them"" by leaving the bathroom door ajar, being very quiet, maybe posing suggestively, and their intent is that you see them naked for their own sexual gratification, that's sexual harassment. The intent is different.

In the Chris Pratt situation, there's no sexual context, there is a subject, and there's no (I think it's safe to assume, given the context and the audience in the room) sexual intent. It's certainly a little eyebrow-raising, but it's not _sexual harassment_. 

&&You may actually be on to something there...&&Bigus Dickus is sewious name!&&Keep going. Taking notes here&&""To impress a chick, helicopter dick, helicopter dick""&&Shoving a buzz lightyear figure up your ass isn't the same thing as an unwanted sexual advance just because you can't get it back out.&&This gave me a Woody. &&> not to mention passing on his STDs.

So he really was method acting in Dallas Buyers Club?&&What about the droid attack on the wookies?&&Holy cow, where did Breitbart say that? 

I’ve got faces to throw that in. &&Yeah, I have a ton of beef with right-wingers who're acting like they're brave defenders of victims now that this Hollywood stuff is coming out. It's more likely that they care about bringing down Hollywood in any way, shape or form, considering that they voted en masse for a guy who bragged about groping women without asking them. 

I could go on with that for days, but I also don't have any pity for the scum in Hollywood, so it is what it is I guess. I could just do without the grandstanding. &&""Fuck Hollywood! It's full of scum who abuse their power to take advantage of people! I wish people would take them down!""

[Multiple people come out against someone they like]

""Hold on a second""

Like, there's so much talk about how the people pretending like it's brave to come out against Weinstein are annoying because it's not. Weinstein's doings have been known, just not the extent of them. He's not well-liked, so /r/movies being against him really doesn't matter, as they've pointed out, it's not some brave, principled stance. 

Now, when It's someone like Louie, who people LOVE on reddit, it's different. 

But this is where it matters the most, when it's someone that you like, that's where how much you actually care and how much is just grandstanding is tested. 

I think this sub and others have done a pretty decent job, but there a good chunk of people who are failing miserably. 

Note- Now mind you, this stuff with Louie has been around for a while. People know about this, it's an ""open secret"", like people like to say around here. 

Not to mention, it's not just ""accusations"", he's literally apologizing directly to the people he did this stuff too. There's a reason he's not strongly denying anything. 

So the people here who're saying that we shouldn't come out against him because there's not enough ""proof"" yet are just completely off base.

But at least they're showing their true colors, and just how much they actually care about ""rationality"" (Hint: They don't and will do anything to defend the people they like) &&Yea I saw that happen on Fox News at the gym last night. Their panel was discussing Louis CK “the disgusting leftist” and then shortly after they moved on to republican candidate Roy Moore and it was all “it’s too soon to know for sure we should wait for more details.”

&&I'm currently getting many replies from people trying to defend him, so yeah people here are not wanting to accept that he was being a creep. &&What also makes me uneasy is that within the same NYT expose, they attribute their lack of success as comedians to Louis CK.   There are a lot of things about these allegations that seem different.  One of his accusers is saying that he asked them if he could masturbate, they said no and he didn't do it.  He never abused his power or offered to use his status to promote them.  Hell, he wasn't even that powerful or successful in the early 2000s anyway.  His magnum opus at the time was Pooty Tang.

... My point is, this doesn't seem like harassment, assault, misconduct, etc...  It just seems abnormal or perverted.  I really hate when the SJW say ""its assault from a safe distance.""  NO!  Assault form a safe distance is still assault.  This doesn't appear to be assault.  Just an ugly dude with weird fetishy attractions. &&Weren't a couple of the women working for him though? Or at least on projects that he was the star of? Because then it's definitely a big deal, because not consenting could cost them their job. Its not asking some girl at a bar, it's putting employees in a position where they don't know if saying no might ruin their career. 

&&Donnie Yen is Agent Wukong

https://splinternews.com/breitbart-puts-a-transparently-disgusting-spin-on-the-r-1820302400

Upon reading, it's more that they use someone's comments that he was romantic as a way to excuse his behavior.
&&Do people believe in criminal rehabilitation?

Do people believe that there different levels of severity in crime?

The publicized claims against Louis are more than a decade old. Has he reformed himself? Does exposing-yourself rise to the level of Weinstein or Toback charges; terroristic threats, physical assault, fondling, rape? 

How bad is Louis and has he been trying to rehabilitate himself in secret?


If only he had done something society finds forgivable like antisemitism, then he would be on  the rebound like Mel Gibson.

If only he had the good fortune to be younger and handsomer like Chris Brown, then he would get chance after chance to redeem himself.&&I feel like I've been living under a rock because I didn't know about any of this.  I always liked Louie, watched his FX series a few times over, stand up specials, etc.  Looking back a lot of his material is very creepy.&&he was being a creep.

Harvey Weinstein will hopefully and deservedly be going to jail.

There is a difference. 
&&Yeah but what bothers me is that people have no concept of forgiveness either, he apologized and we can start to move on but people make it seem like he raped people.&&It's starfuckers grabbing their 15 seconds of fame after a failed career.&&also weird is subjective. There is a sub on reddit devoted to how many sharpies someone can stick up their ass. Why? I don't know. But there are 50k subscribers. And girls are making content for it. 

So... who's to judge anymore what's weird and what isn't. The only thing we should care about is consent. After that, jerk off in front of someone or stick a sharpie up your ass. Whatever floats your boat, just don't hurt any innocents.

Great, now I'm doing it.&&Both Captain America series are better than the first, but you're mostly right&&I fail to see why people so strongly dislike AoU&&I felt the same way when I first heard ant man was in production. I just wrote it off and I didn't even bother going to watch it when it came out in theaters. I rent it on my Xbox and I was pretty impressed. I watched it two more times and bought a copy. 

I still go back now a days and watch the ending fight scenes. &&PLS, AOU is Epic.&&Oh I thought Cross/Yellowjacket was good for what he was given. I thought the psycho ex pupil aspect was interesting and the yellowjacket fights were awesome. Definitely better than the following:

It was just a good ass comedy with some action.&&Well done and well placed comedy though - the serious moments were still serious, unlike GotG 2 or Thor 3&&I liked parts of SS?  I liked watching Deadshot shoot stuff.   I liked MR in her business wear before she turned into HQ.  In her professional clothing, she looked like the kind of girl that would take you to her basement and make you her bitch. Didn’t know I liked that. 

I thought Viola Davis’s Amanda Waller was spot on. I like her “Nobody ever does” line the best. She really came across as an evil cunt. Did she die?  Hope not. &&I didn’t hate it but seriously DC could’ve made the movie way better &&Me too, and Ant-Man is my favourite MCU character &&Zack Snyder and classic Avengers characters coming to life.&&She's an actress and is on some SF casting site so they just emailed her saying they needed extras for a movie.

She actually did give me some serious spoilers for the film 😬&&Isn’t that the point? Or do people not age in the quantum realm?&&Thor 3 as well&&Disagree, but I'm an older demographic.

The sepia-toned nostalgia of ""The First Avenger"" just hit all the right buttons for me. The first time he punched a Hydra/Nazi stooge I squeeeeed inside like a little kid.

Also, it had Peggy Carter being all badass in it, too.

""Winter Soldier"" *was* a fantastic movie, though.

I liked all three but ""Civil War"" comes in last place with the first barely edging out the second for my favorite.&&If anything, the problem with Cross/Yellowjacket was that they only scratched the surface of what could have been a better villain. 

The movie claimed that Cross was going crazy being around the Pym particles for too long, but that's all it was. Words. We never actually saw him struggle between being normal, and going crazy.&&To be fair, the Mandarin was awesome.

It was awesome. &&My only real celebrity encounter was with him and Jon Glaser.  I was in New Orleans a few years ago for work and we were out at a restaurant for a team dinner.  As we were leaving a few of us happened to notice them sitting together in the outdoor dining area out front.  I thought I was subtle in taking a quick picture and went to walk away but then Paul Rudd called out to me and waved my coworker and I over.  I thought he was going to be upset that I took the picture without asking but he was pretty chill and spoke with us for a few minutes.  It was nice that he went out of the way to chat with some fans while he was out trying to eat at a restaurant.  He had the anchorman mustache which made it all the better.  

Not a super exciting story but it made my day at the time.  And I still have the super awkward picture of them eating dinner with Jon Glaser looking directly at me (clearly I wasn’t very subtle)

In the OG comics, Hank inhales a chemical that turns him villainous for a while, which is when Scott takes over the mantle of Ant-Man.

Dumb and Dumber's ""Big Gulps huh? ...... Well, see ya later!"" is probably my favorite of all time.

Justice League, on the other hand, had that obnoxious Mercedes and Schick placement, and I feel like the first Thor had a pretty obvious Doctor Pepper machine as well.

[I'm not sure we'll ever top Hawaii 5-0's placement, though - so ono.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQYwFND7rHE)&&to be fair you don't really release a movie called ""ant-man"" and expect it to sell well with audiences. luckily for them though people have become really accustom to ""weird"" marvel movies, so it actually didn't do too bad.&&Why would you say they 'needed' it?  The scene is a fuckload better if its Baskin Robbins than if its a generic ice cream shop.

Ant man should be part of the Mac & Me universe. &&That's a weird lookin dog&&Ragnarok had me in stitches, and most all of the jokes landed, but the comedy in Ant Man felt more organic. Ragnarok bordered on the Adam McKay type improv style where it felt like the characters were riffing with each other (as they were).&&While I enjoyed both, half of Ragnarok's dialogue sounded like outtakes to me. Antman felt like more planned out comedy.&&Idk. Some of the comedy felt really out of place in Raganarok.&&ragnarok was an action movie with humour.  antman was a family comedy with action.&&""Baskin Robins always finds out"" is my personal favorite quote in the qhole movie&&Plus, they picked Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Did anyone think it was gonna be a super serious movie?&&I don't really agree with that. GotG had some great emotional and serious scenes. Maybe it is the theme of fatherhood that hit me harder because of my owns fathers illness but it was the first Marvel movie I have cried at. The last song and scene is brutal. 

Thor 3 didn't really have that many serious and emotional scenes but I still think the movie works. &&GOTG2 had a lot of unnecessary and forced comedy during the serious moments, while Thor 3 just had a lot of comedy but not much serious moments but those moments were not cut by forced jokes unlike the former.&&> Did she die? Hope not.

No, she’s in a post-credit scene with Affleck giving him info on what eventually becomes the Justice League.&&I think the SS was a collection of good scenes tied together with very bad writing and plot development.

“Hey we need to defeat the next Superman if he turns out to be a bad guy. What about the crazy chick with a bat and a guy who shoots regular bullets?” 

Again, fun scenes with no cohesion. &&Good for you then, at least you can like a movie (or parts of it) without being put off by its flaws, massive ones too.&&Wrong.

Paul Rudd.&&That's really cool!

The fights are amazing. Cap1 had a big action montage and some good chance scenes but there wasn't a while lot of actual fighting in it&&We also get some hints that Pym and Cross used to have a close relationship, but we never really get to see it. For example, when Cross asks Pym why he pushed him away, and Pym replies that he saw ""too much of myself,"" what does he really mean?

He definitely went through different parts of the multi-verse and a few places looks kinda similar, but none were the quantum realm. You can however see Hank's wife in a few split second shots during the Ant Man quantum realm scene. Meaning she is alive and was watching it happen somehow? Or maybe they were just teasing the fans. Anyhow, still pretty interesting.

Because that movie kept trying to stick jokes in where I felt it needed to have more serious moments.&&The only one that really stuck out to me was the Devils Anus thing. It would have been ok if they had just left it as a one off, but they must have said it a half dozen times during. That whole segment of the final escape was meh&&honestly the transition from I have a Master's in engineering(or whatever it was) how hard can getting a job be to him working at BR is the funniest and realest fucking joke ever. &&Baskin Robbins don't play&&Paul rudd got a 6 pack abs for this movie. That's very completely serious.&&I'm with you on this one. My mom, who usually dislikes action movies, and especially superhero movies cried at the end of this one. Yondu was super well done in this, enough for me to overlook some maybe off-jokes.&&I wrote this comment somewhere else too, but I watched GOTG2 a week before my son was born and I was definitely crying more than my wife at the end. Made me think so much about the father that I want to be, and how important it is that I'm there for my son. The pregnancy was not planned, and I absolutely love my wife, but I can't lie and say that I've never thought about running away. It also made me think a lot about my own complicated relationship with my father.

My life story aside: Way too many jokes throughout, and imo a lot fell flat, but it redeemed itself in the end and felt like an emotional gut-punch.

So basically, I agree with you but I'm also not sure if it only hit me hard due to my personal situation.

PS - From one person with a father who is in poor health to another, I hope things work out as well as they can.&&It’s the putting the parts together into a movie thing that makes me scratch my head a bit. 

I think DC/WB has WAY too many people sticking their hands into the movie.  Hire a team and let them do their thing. You don’t like the final product?  Fine, put together a better team next time. &&Yah she said Laurence Fishburne was suuuper nice to everyone, and Evangeline Lilly was really charming. She didn't really get to meet anyone other than them, but got to see the big finally shot with everyone in costume and said it was so cool. Super jealous that she got to see Paul Rudd in his new costume. &&Why the fuck, outta all the 17 MCU movies to choose from, would you watch Thor 2 three times? The only reason I would watch it was for Loki's lines &&The Marvel one shot ""All Hail the King"" actually proved that the real Mandarin is out there somewhere. Not to mention he could possibly be a serious threat considering how he (his men) broke in and infiltrated the prison to break fake Mandarin/Trevor out. &&Clearly you didn't get enough 4d3d3d3&&This clip is actually OG as hell, from Tim and Eric on adult swim from way back.&&Its on the inner nette&&after shrim I never want to see that. 

&&New Avengers. The original Avengers are taken down in some way in Infinity War, and Spidey, Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp have to come together to save Earth and maybe the original Avengers. Spoilery enough to not tell us now, intriguing enough for the general public, it was a popular comic in the 00s, etc.&&Death of a Hero?

I say that because I don't see a need for secrecy unless it reveals something about the plot of Infinity War. &&That was the case originally, but they then walked back on that because apparently the two films aren't really two parts, even if they're heavily connected.&&Or ABC's HIT new show, Marvel's The Inhumans!!!!!

Edit: /s Jeez are shills really that obvious sounding?&&I just rewatched Iron Man over the weekend. It still holds up pretty well.

But then I realized we haven't seen Nick Fury since Winter Soldier, in 2014.&&My 8 year old son comes with me to every marvel movie and has since I think age of ultron. He has also watched all the previous movies.

I mean, Pym says that maintaining his mass and increasing density is what causes Antman to hit that much harder when he's small. So shouldn't it be the opposite when he's big? And make him so light that a gust of wind blows him away? Also Pym carries about a multi-ton tank on a keychain this whole time?&&I think they're more referencing how Bill Foster dies in the comics. Laurence Fishburne is great.&&Yep, it's what he does in the comics. It also sort of goes in line with Kevin Feige/James Gunn saying that the MCU will be going more cosmic in Phase 4 and that Strange was the start of the ""Marvel Cosmic Universe"".&&He's the cosmic Nick Fury&&That and it makes the movie universe feel way more alive. The main problem with the movies is that in comics, characters kind of just exist statically. But since RDJ and Hemsworth and everyone are so widely known as these characters and they're going for such an interconnected universe, it makes much less sense for characters to just be idly off screen while these world threatening catastrophes occur. I get that the actors need to be paid and put on their respective movie bills, but seeing Strange existing as a character while other things happen makes the universe feel alive and breathing. Just like how Hive in Agents of Shield would warrant the Avengers help in reality. &&I dunno, I'm not sure ""feeling of progression"" is what I got from that scene. He was basically already in God Mode, effortlessly bending realities and warping people's minds. I'm not sure where he really has left to go at this point.&&I loved how he exited.

I think it was the remnants of Wright's script that made the movie much tighter than his other comedic works.&&And they did it so many times, that they lampshaded themselves by *not* making the joke when it was fully set up and you most expected it. 



&&Sounds like Gotg2&&Thor 3 felt like what GOTG2 should've been. &&For the record, I haven't watched the new Thor yet.

I agree that the wrong timed jokes in GotG2 were problematic, but that ""world"" (for the lack of a better term) has always been inherently ridiculous, over-the-top and comedic regardless of that fact, compared to Thor which had been until recently more serious.&&I couldn't stand GotG2 because of that. I couldn't shake the try hard feel from it.&&I don't agree. Honestly with the music, Jeff Golblum's orgymobile and the sense of humour in general that was one of the more enjoyable Marvel action set pieces that I've seen. I don't even remember the others and tend to just tune them out, aside from the airport scene in Civil War.&&And korgs joke about asgards foundations.

If DC was like Marvel, Superman and the GLs would be meeting up every other Tuesday.

This is the first time I really got that feeling from any of the Marvel movies and it was pretty sweet.&&How bout a ""feeling of accomplishment""?&&The picture on the left can't be the same as the right. The Dark realm (on the left) is a different scene from the ending of Doctor Strange. The picture on the right is from Ant man and is one of the three glimpses you see of the wasp. I have tried looking, but i just cant find any shots of the sub atomic or quantum realm in Doctor Strange.  &&thats true but the guardians have the advantage of having not yet interfered with the rest of the marvel universe, where as ant-man himself has been in civil war and will be in Infinity war&&guardians 2 is only a couple months after guardians 1?&&Skurge was a pretty pointless character, I felt. And I like Karl Urban.&&Which time was that?&&To their credit, they did let The Immigrant unironically blare at us during the exact moment that battle is initiated.  I laughed my balls off at this movie, but I *remember* the moments where they let the action land.  The ride of the Valkyries was another one.&&Yes I liked it much more, felt way more cohesive and the jokes weren't so mean spirited. &&The problem is the first gotg film balanced these moments so well, and evem whrn thr jokes started it still felt like it progressed something in the film even if its just character development. 

Thr jokes in the second seem to carry on longer then they should and it keeps firing jokes out without care&&while I enjoyed got GotG and GotG2 and I really like James Gunn as a film maker, one of the big problems I had with the first one is it constantly felt like JG was sitting next to me, elbowing me, going ""eh, did you find that funny, bet you thought that was really fun"" coupled with the tendency to have a dramatic moment, and then like clockwork, cut it with a joke and never let it play.

When he was the sole screenwriter for vol2, I felt like that all got super hyper charged, to the detriment of the film.&&***IT'S MY BIRTHDAY***&&I laughed but I like humor in moments that are depressing to lighten the mood.&&That speaks more to the fact that no one has given a shit about the asgardians since the beginning of the series. With that in mind I think they were right to go all in with the jokes &&Korg is that friend that just doesn't know when to shut up.  No matter how inappropriate the situation.&&I don't think that was so bad. From Korg's point of view he's legitimately trying to cheer the Asgardians up, and from the main characters' points of view, they knew Asgard was going to be completely destroyed either way. It was their own plan that led to this, and we the audience as well as Thor/Loki/Valkyrie had known this was going to happen for like 10 minutes. It didn't take away from the emotions of the scene IMO, not to mention all the talking about how ""Asgard is not a place, it's a people"".&&>marvel seems to have a Vision

They sure do!&&I kind of think it's the other way. Marvel has a formula, and a really good formula. DC, especially Snyder, have visions out the ass, literal visions that create serious visual power every now and then. But none of them really turn into coherent plots.&&That's a good rule of thumb haha.&&And Tim and Eric were the best at it. &&It seems really obvious but maybe there will be a surprise twist. Maybe Iron Man and Cap die together saving the world (unlikely).

I imagine it will be more Cap sacrifices himself, Bucky saves Tony, and then Tony hands over the shield and says ""Prove him right"" or something.&&I just don't see them resetting the MCU to that extent. It would alienate so much of the non comic book reading fan base.&&Was he? I guess he was. What year was that again?&&That’s one of the things I love about how all these movies tie together. Usually someone getting credited runs a surprise of their appearance in a movie. But you have no idea to what extent. It could be civil war iron man or Thor cap/Loki. You just don’t know and it’s great&&[deleted]&&Yep, that's the one. Don't think he's come back yet either.&&Nah that would get confusing. 

We could call it the ""Dominantly Cosmic Cinematic Universe,"" or DCCU for short.&&Well the other option is the McCU and that just sound like the off-brand dollar menu version of the regular MCU&&You are completely right about the picture. Thought I saw that in the strange film, but it was ant man. However Dr Strange does indeed pass thru the quantum realm when he’s “travelling,” the director even confirms it [here.](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-ant-man-quantum-realm/)&&That makes sense. I guess that it would be a little confusing for audiences when they just saw some major stuff go down in Infinity War and none of that happened yet in the movie after it.&&Yeah. Space time is weird.&&Yep. I thought that it was kinda obvious that Groot is a baby and all, but somewhere Gunn confirmed it.&&Have to agree. It was only my biased love of Urban that prevented me from singling him out.&&Really was just a sounding board for the villain.&&Yeah, I'd have liked to see him take a more active role in Hela's reign of terror.  It would've made his arc better at the end.&&The character was pretty pointless as far as the plot was concerned, but was necessary for the movie.  Without him there, basically everything hela said would've been out of place.&&Thor and Loki, near the end; that's the best example.&&[deleted]&&I love James Gunn's work for sure. Totally agree with you. That's kinda what made seeing GotG2 hurt that much more. I loved what he did with the first. I kinda just felt this ""we're too comfortable with the work"" feel in the second. So that must've been it.&&Loved that with his falsetto. &&No way, man. I want my over-the-top sci-fi action comic book movies to be really serious and somber. Especially given the back-drop of Ragnarok with the Asgardian disk-world getting destroyed by a video game monster. That was super serious business.

I loved Thor: Ragnarok. The only thing that would have made it better would have been more Banner/Thor time, more Goldblum, basically just more time on Sakaar doing whacky fun-things.

It is odd to me that the only 'in-universe' events after-Earth meets Thanos, is just an Ant-man/Wasp solo story. Could either mean Ant-man won't have a super important role in IW or that the events of the movie take place before Thanos wrecks shit.&&I think he basically existed so Hela had someone to talk and rant to for half the movie. &&I thought the villain was a lame concept too, even though cate blanchett acted the shit out of it. There wasn’t much to that plotline and everything around it was hela predictable. &&I'd bet there's deleted scenes of him tormenting Asgard. It was honestly surprising that Urban would show up for a role so small.&&Haha, right. He was essentially a plot device as well as a sounding board for Hela, like someone else here said.&&I guess, but some of it was just random bashing that eventually leads to Rocket and Peter having a falling out. I don't need one of the main sources of conflict in a full length super hero movie to be similar to an episode of a cw show. I like watching the flash, but I don't need that in something bigger. Thor was able to have some actual conversations that seemed like some friends going back and forth and dealing with stressful situations.

I really don't think that Infinity War will allow Ant-Man and the Wasp to happen after it, because Captain Marvel is set in the 90's and that Thanos might or might not have all 6 stones by the end. Probably not all 6 but he should have enough to do some good damage to Earth.&&A sounding board to progress the plot and explain the history.&&and to shoot 200 shots out of 30 ammo magazine&&Would have been awesome to have the movie open with an Odin narration about Hela being his executioner instead of cate explaining it via exposition. They can still have the last ride of the valkyries flash back too, just not in that opening montage. I really missed that piece from this movie. Each thor movie always started with an Odin narration about something that happened a long time ago. And it was pretty epic.&&Totally. There wasn't much about the Asgard scenes in general that was very interesting, aside from Blanchett's performance. The story was extremely unbalanced in its weighting between locations. &&She was super hot though &&>everything around it was hela predictable.

I see what you did there.&&Blanchett looked just good enough in her goth fetish getup for me to not care as much about how thin her characterization was.&&My only complaint is they couldn't have made it closer to actual Norse lore and make hela and fenris Lokis kids, which is sort of what they did in some of the cartoons and comics (I think).

 It wouldve been interesting to see Loki atoning for having a shitty evil daughter and wolf monster for kids, instead of atoning for being a dickhead like in every other movie he's in. &&Yes but Thor is generally portrayed as a much kinder person than Rocket or Peter Quill, that's my point.  It's who they are as characters. 

It's like complaining that The Punisher keeps killing people, which is what people reviewing the new series are doing for some reason. &&A whole movie about Hulk on a planet, many call it Planet Hulk.&&",2017-11-20 12:12:41

They did a great job of making Owen Wilson look like Edward Norton"". &&It manages what a Family Guy-type spoof can't: It has enough apparent love for its subject to fully dig into what it means.

This isn't terribly funny as a direct parody, but everything about it is funny in the way Wes' films tend to be.

I was thinking about the constable scene, and how disciplined the murderers are in how they stab, then return to their affected poses.  I mean, that's definitely a thing that's happening in Wes' work, and I consider myself a fan, but the people who made this video directed the fuck out of that stuff in a way that I hadn't even considered.

If ya swapped out the superficial details taken from Royal Tennenbaums for more original stuff, this would just be a great homage.&&Edward Norton was really solid this whole episode &&I didnt even realize this was Edward Norton... &&Wow&&I love Wes Anderson, and this parody was totally on point.

He's one of SNL's go-to directors for filmed skits.&&Yeah, right???

According to some forum post from 2016, the song used to be available in its entirety on YouTube, but has since been taken down. There seems to be no download links anywhere and you can't find the song on Spotify, Amazon, iTunes and so forth.

So I would say there is no way to find it by simply googling.

For all the reasons you mention, this is a good example of how parody can help you appreciate an original work by highlighting its idiosyncrasies.

Now remember: I hadn’t slept in what feels like days at this point and all I recall is Adam working his stylus at lightning speed, whispering to himself, “It’s gonna be close…it’s gonna be reeeeal close…”. Too close, in fact — as Rhys was then told by the studio that we were out of time; they would have to run the version with the errors. CUT TO: CLOSE UP – Rhys’ face, crushed in defeat. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Rhys, Adam had just uploaded the fixes to the server, then raced over to the live monitor and just held his breath as our spot went live exactly 20 seconds later.

>What none of us knew at the time is that the studio associate director, Matt Yonks, decided to roll the dice and play the fixed spot directly to the air. The spot was literally still loading into the switcher as it was being broadcast out. Holy crap. Thank you, Yonks!&&Ah, director on Documentary Now too. Guy is amazing at perfectly matching styles.

Edit: Special shout out to the ""Globesman"" episode. The original doc, *Salesman*, is terrific, but that short is the perfect companion piece. And it's so much funnier and touching due to the fact that it looks *exactly* like the visually innovative original. So well done.&&And the inventory of weapons was 100% spot on too.&&The Owen Wilson impersonation definitely clicked for me then. He doesn't look much like Owen, but his voice was spot on.&&For me, that was the best homage, because it was less visual and thus more subtle.&&Dear murderers, 

No you may not. 

Signed, 

The homeowners.  &&Who is Wes Anderson? &&Wow, yeah, I think you're right.&&I just read this and only understood about 20% but the bit at the end about fixing it up until it aired is BONKERS. &&Thank you so much for posting this! I really appreciate it. I've always loved this video, happily watched it again when I saw it reposted, and just now enjoyed finding out how it was made. Time to see if Wes Anderson has commented on it!&&The process of creating the art is just a awesome as the art itself &&Fantastic Mr Fox is beautiful. &&Oh shit I'd forgotten about Isle of Dogs and now I'm simultaneously aroused at the thought and frustrated with it's not being released. Pretty standard feelings in hindsight &&Definitely not what I expected, but definitely better than what I expected, which was the compilation video of Owen Wilson wows.&&Reminds me of [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvERJ7CSD8I)&&I had forgotten how terrible those movies were&&Neither can Edward Norton.&&Da fuh?&&Much like Quentin Tarantino, his style is distinct and I keep thinking they will lose their touch, but they keep putting out great material. Even though I know what to expect visually, they still make their films stand out. &&As long as he doesnt go the way Tim Burton did, im ok with it.&&They often strike me as being similar to a pop-up storybook in aesthetic, and I think you have to be someone who appreciates that to enjoy them. While I wasn't crazy about a couple of his films, I love the rest, due to their prettiness and their blunt humour.&&I watch Wes Anderson solely because I'm amazed at how it works when it really shouldn't. &&As someone who really likes his movies I definitely understand why someone would not. His movies are heavily stylized and if you don't like the style there's not much left for you there. &&I think the reason why Wes Anderson turns some people off is when you look at most of them they aren't really movies, they are more or less filmed plays. While that is not always true but watching Life Aquatic, Grand Budapest Hotel, and Moonrise Kingdom it just feels like a movie version of a play rather than an actual film. &&Maybe you're in a minority, but you're not alone.   I really enjoyed Grand Budhapest Hotel, but none of his other stuff have ever ""done it for me.""  

I felt like that movie justified its own absurdity. It's a girl reading a book based on an old man remembering years of events, so of course it's embellished and grandiose.

His other movies just feel like they try too hard to push an aesthetic in my face.  Sometimes I want to scream ""I get it, you're quirky!"" at them.  It's not just the quirkiness in and of itself, it's that it seems to obfuscate the actual story in favor of uniqueness.  They feel less like stories more like a bunch of conceptual shots strung loosely together.&&The thing about being highly stylized, in any art form, is that if people don't dig it, they aren't gonna dig any of it.

Like, if you don't like one AC/DC song, you probably won't like any of them.

But if you dig that sound, you're gonna really love the artist.&&I can already hear the screeches coming from some artsy fartsy right now &&Wonder what their mean jerk time was.&&I have no idea how that's possible, but holy fuck that gave me goosebumps. &&Mr Fox!&&Yup. Same. Thought it was two as well. Time flies.&&It feel like I saw this today.&&""You had me at Wes Anderson""

Jeff Goldblum plays Bill Murray’s Dad. 

There are a lot of other shocking cameos. 

President Obama even had a small role in it as the local Sheriff. It’s nuts. &&It's pretty good, the narration is a bit off. Hilarious though!&&""I just came.""

For reals. Where is Ja? I really need Ja to make sense of all this.&&The music choice is only so-so the rest is genius.&&Not a Wes Anderson parody, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=majoEELiiYc) is one of the best Owen Wilson impersonations I've came across.&&Oh wauw&&I still do Edward Norton impression of Owen Wilson when I try. I guess this video really stuck with me. &&I thought this was fantastic. ""you're a talented photographer! "" ""You've seen my photography?"" ""I have heard, great, things."" Perfect. &&I literally posted the same comment as you and got like 8 downvotes and people called the video ""fucking terrible"". What the hell reddit?&&That's one of the worst ones.

It fundamentally misunderstands the type of people Wes Anderson makes his movies about. Wes Anderson's characters aren't malaise filled sad sacks. They're instigators. They're men of action. They dive in head first when they probably shouldn't. 

Royal Tenenbaum, Max Fischer, Steve Zissou, Mr Fox, Zero and M. Gustave wouldn't just sit around moping. 

&&Agreed, that was pretty food.&&It's Life Aquatic and that's my favorite Wes Anderson movie&&Least favourite? LEAST FAVOURITE? Bill Murray fights ship invading pirates while looking fashionable as fuck and it's your least favourite? Bill Murray goes hunting a beautiful mythical sea beast and it's your least favourite???? 

I don't know why that made me so mad but it did, i know it won't matter to you but just know that someone you will never meet and who knows absolutely nothing about you is severely disappointed in your judgement and choices.&&hey wow&&Wauw&&I’ll try to find it&&[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCHpSoNg-XKIjxwSQp_ZmULTD6ktuM5f/view?usp=sharing) you go. &&This one doesn't have Mr Fox in it, so it's just Fantastic.&&Thank you. Happy thanksgiving&&Uau&&OK bear with me here but I've been trying to convince my friends that I enjoyed the porn parody of Game of Thrones for the exact same reasons you just said. It's legit a loving tribute to GoT as much as it is hardcore porn movie and the attention to detail is fantastic. &&Reminds me of the comment about why the WoW episode of South Park was so good. Wasn't making fun of it like family Guy would, but was a proper parody/satire of it. *Insert Archer no one knows the difference*&&I much preferred the Fangoria review.  
'Da fuh?'&&Yes, the Family Guy parody is rather shallow and pedantic.&&Family guy actually just did an episode split 3 ways telling the same story like certain directors, one of them being Wes Anderson&&...all of you guys are the worst.&&Why did this turn into a let's-shit-on-Family-Guy thing? The show can be fucking hilarious. Sure, a lot of episodes fall flat on their ass but the good episodes more than make up for that imo.&&But that's why most people liked his Star Wars parodies.  It's clear that he loves the source material.

It's when he parodies other things in regular episodes where it gets pretty blunt and forced.&&Wow.&&The voice is fantastic 😂 &&""Tilda Swinton"" was Kate McKinnon I think.&&Nasim Padrad is the daughter. She's so awesome, I wish she had been in more bits. My favorite was lil blaster in the kickspit underground music fest.&&Voiceover by Alec Baldwin. 

I think the Paltrow character is Samantha Bee?&&Tilda Swinton is Kate McKinnon? &&Definitely a lot of hard work. Not sure how it is now, but years ago this show was driven by cocaine.&&Awesome! How was that one by the way? Kinda looking at the MZed subscription with their Black Friday deal. And it's absolutely insane the work ethic that team has. I love how well they can adapt their styles so well depending on the spot they're doing. &&I don't know why, but I just love little things like that in his film.

It seems to come out of nowhere and is kinda jarring, but very very stylish.&&Wow&&that was Edward Norton&&Yooo, I hadn't thought of that, but very true.

It required keener observation of Wes Anderson's film style.&&Director of several of my favorite films.  His style is one of a kind, and some would say an aquired taste.  Personally, I will always make a point of seeing any new work of his. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Anderson&&Everyone else is wrong.  The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is by far his best work.  Go and watch it tonight.  Go on. Get.


Edit: Now with [trailery goodness.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&v=aZVxCNwBqXI)&&.............Sad.&&Check out the editing process from another short that year https://vimeo.com/94122880&&The most charming movie you'll ever see&&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.&&Thanks Perd Hapley &&oh fuck me that's good&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iUhRy4hw9Q&&wow&&Alec Baldwin &&You either die Wes Anderson, or live long enough to see yourself become Tim Burton.&&They are a lot like Andy Samberg for me, I never found him to be enjoyable until Brooklyn nine nine, now I'm a big fan. For Wes it was Grand Budapest hotel, went from ehhh I get it and don't like it to wow that is great.&&Personally, one of my favorite aspects of his films is the symmetry in his shots. He puts so much effort into it and it makes his movies really stand out. That, and the fact that he picks out color pallets so purposefully as well. He's very thoughtful with his work and it shows.&&This exactly. The reason I love Wes Anderson is because of the style. His visual compositions are so compelling, and the color palette is so detailed. The dialogue is short and direct. It's not quite life-like, and I'm sure that's why it's off putting for some people. &&In what way? Other than plays generally requiring somewhat less naturalistic acting by virtue of them being in less convincing spaces and actors needed to reach a large room of people, and Wes Anderson also not normally going for naturalism, I don't see the connection. 

And Anderson is literally known for obvious camera movements, so calling them filmed plays seems pretty weird. &&What the heck? That's Arin from Game Grumps narrating it. How odd. &&I never want to watch a porn narrated by Tay Zonday.&&Yes it is. And Egoraptor's the narrator&&Yes!&&and im pretty sure this is the same owen wilson:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcjhnJHNjtQ&&It's on YouTube, it can't be that bad&&Peter Gilroy&&That was fucking beautiful.&&Yep, perfect.&&What... what is this.  &&That was painfully close&&This is hilarious! &&How does that have so few views? It's amazing. &&damn this is really something&&Wow.&&That's you pretending to be Edward Norton pretending to be Owen Wilson pretending to be a Wes Anderson character. 

Wow. &&You make a fair point, but I just want to point out that this isn't always true, as much of Luke Wilson's character in Tennenbaums was exactly the depressed moper who lost his will to be an instigator.&&Valid points for sure. I just think its funny I guess, plus the voice acting is pretty good. 
  &&> It's Life Aquatic and that's my favorite Wes Anderson movie

Seu Jorge, the Brazilian musician who sings Bowie songs in Portuguese in the movie, recently went on tour. I went to see his show and it was amazing. He had his blue shirt and red tuque on and his voice is amazing live. &&That one and The Fantastic Mr Fox are tied for my favorites.

""CONTACT!""&&*The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. And I still get a weird sense of wonder watching that movie. Love it to bits. It's so perfect.&&“Do the interns get glocks?”

“They share one.”&&On paper it would be my favorite, but I also rank it below most of his other films. It's good but pacing just doesn't fit for me.&&I'd agree that life aquatic is my least favorite. It isn't that it is bad but it doesn't have the same feeling, at least to me, as the other films.&&I remember watching that scene for the first time. I was seriously waiting for that whole thing to be some kind of dream sequence. It was just too surreal. And then *the movie kept going*, which felt even weirder.

That movie also has that moment you seen in some of his movies where the darkness of the movie is just barely concealed by the absurdity. At some point it just drops away and the bleakness of it all wins out for awhile. I think I watch Wes Anderson movies for moments like Bill Murray breaking down and crying in a submarine.&&Oooh please! &&This guy right here. 🏆&&MVP of the night.

For what's worth, I think it actually rebounded a bit from its lowest point 2-3 years ago.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mped9-bkFUE

Seems fine to me?&&the issue is MacFarlane hasn't been writing Family Guy episodes for quite a few years now, and it shows. Earlier seasons were parodies with authentic appreciation for the source material (musicals; star wars, rex harrison, etc).

It happens to any show that runs too long...&&Shut up Byron!&&Waow.&&Wow!&&It really was spot on. Almost had to double take.&&It’s Noel Wells playing Paltrow.

I thought Owen Wilson was somehow different in order to look like someone, and I also thought he was acting much better than usual. I have a non-negligible dose of face-blindness though.&&wow. I knew it was some one famous, but couldn't place who it was. That was pretty good. &&Which is pretty on point to parody Wes Anderson too.&&I love Wes Anderson too, but the fact is this satire is biting and hilarious and absolutely pegs what he does. My favorites are Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums and Grand Budapest Hotel. Only film of his I didn't like was Fantastic Mr. Fox, just couldn't get into it.&&Also 

ISLE OF DOGS!@!!!!!&&My favourite film of all time. It’s goddamn life affirming. &&I wouldn’t say “by far”. I’d say The Royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel are all at least as good, if not better. But Life Aquatic is certainly underrated, excellent film in every way and super hilarious.&&I love a good adventure movie, and by god Wes Anderson delivers for a somewhat silly comedy drama. I want to live on the Belafonte!&&Yeah, probably the best.  Excellent soundtrack too.  I've kept it in my car's CD rotation for the last ten or so years.&&It's awesome, but it's definitely a bit of an acquired taste. I went into it after seeing Moonrise and Budapest Hotel, and found it mostly just kind of baffling, but on a repeat viewing I absolutely loved it.&&As someone who works in deep sea exploration I am convinced he sailed or had people clandestinely sail on several expeditions. He was spot on for what different groups are like. I've definitely sailed on a Steve Zissou type expeditions and Jeff Goldblum style ones.&&yep, its the best one.&&That is bananas!!! They are some seriously talented/hardworking/hilarious/awesome humans.&&My favorite is the juxtaposition of the movie with them eating. It's like Billy Corgan screaming in the middle of a ballad. &&Good God, Lemon &&Grand Budapest was the first Wes Anderson movie I liked. In all the others I loved the cinematography, color grading, etc... I just didn’t care about the characters or the story. Grand Budapest was beautiful AND good.&&Fantastic Mister Fox for me. To date it is only one of two Film Franchises based on novels (the other being LoTR) that doesn't grate on my brain because of changes to the source material. &&> wow 

&&One of my favorite things about Wes films is the fact that he lingers on fucking shots. He gets that if he pours all this effort into beautiful scenery, give the audience a chance to digest it and take it in. 

So many films do the shaky cam, quick cut half second frame editing shots and shit. I can't take anything in. All the money they spend on effects on stuff like Transformers, and then there isn't an action scene with a shot that lasts longer than a split second before they cut away to another half second shot. Makes me want to throw up, I get dizzy easily and it sucks. &&Some would say, abstract. Abstract symmetry.&&God help me, I'm now reading EVERYTHING in Owen Wilson's voice.&&How he sets up the shots, take the camp shot in Moonrise Kingdom it pans across with the set up all facing towards the camera as if everything is a large stage. Even when you reach the table everyone is sitting on the other side facing the camera. I don't mean it is a literally play in the traditional sense of projecting to a room of people but how he treats the shots from a single point of view like the ship in Life Aquatic or the house in Moonrise Kingdom its a way a showing multiple rooms the resembles a stage set up for a scene rather than a traditional movie. It takes you out of an immersive feeling from another movie where you are almost a 3rd character and makes you appreciate that you are watching something as an audience member. If that makes sense at all its how I've always viewed his films and how I appreciate them. He takes elements usually seen on stages and uses them in the film's which make it a little off in a really good way. &&And Owen Wilson is Peter Gilroy! Good choice though, since he has done [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_n_yoEWHYg&ab_channel=BathBoysExtraStuff) before.&&I said that once. &&I don't know ow how to react to it&&Attempting suicide is taking action. && Nah man.

Finding it real hard to believe they’ve got costumes half as good as you say they are&&Fangoria, a magazine that traditionally reviews and covers specifically horror movies, would be put off by by horror movie by Wes Anderson. 

So while The New York Times would immediately be all about it simply because of Anderson's name being attached, a source that covers horror would have an understandable reaction like ""What the fuck is this?""&&In case you're serious, Fangoria is a horror movie review site that would not 'get' Wes Anderson.  This level of affectation would confuse then right out of the theater.&&I think it's just saying this wouldn't be the type of ""horror"" movie Fangoria would give a good review to, because they typically review a ton of cheesy horror films(not a bad thing, somebodies gotta do it). It was a joke at the pretentiousness of NYT, and how much there movie reviewers love Wes, and then a knock at the quality of films Fangoria tends to review.&&Unless there's another layer of meaning it was just reflecting some of the media's reaction to Anderson 's work. There's a section that doesn't really understand/appreciate it and their reaction is being summed up with a 'what the fuck' statement.&&Could be the over-explanatory title?&&It insists upon itself.&&Indubitably&&Indeed&&That's a facile argument and woefully esoteric.
&&The worst part of both family guy and american dad is the obvious time filler jokes. every time Steve breaks into a random song i just know its going to be an overlong and tepid parody of some obscure bullshit no one remembers for the sake of knocking out another minute of runtime.

The best part is it wasn't a snortie straw. It was my suppository applicator. PS BEST SHIT EVER&&It's like ""Once Upon a Time..."", sometimes you just want to be told a story and you want to know there's a storyteller guiding and looking after you. Things like that are nice indicators, like when a narrator in a book tells you he'll explain something in more detail later or says 'dear reader'. The same sort of thing in a talk show or SNL where it feels warm and inviting to have a host welcoming you and taking you through the show.&&I almost divorced my husband over him taking a Wes Anderson movie literally.

It's a book based on memoirs of a writer who interviewed an old man about the time he used to be a kid, all of which is being narrated at a time where everyone involved is long dead.  

The story is the statue approached by the girl at the beginning. It's a tribute, a memorial, and like all such statues that commemorate the past, it's necessarily embellished and romanticized.

20. Sita Sings the Blues&&I was absolutely blown away by *Spirited Away* when I viewed it for the first time. Truly a magnificent film.&&I always respect other people's rights to an opinion but....Finding Nemo is not better than Wall-e.

&&There is no greatest animated film of any time. It’s way too difficult to decide such a thing. &&World of Tomorrow is definitely incredible but does ""Its Such a Beautiful Day"" not count since it's a collection of 3 connected shorts? If so then ok but if not, I've long considered it my favorite movie ever and I think it deserved a spot here instead. I'm glad Hertzfledts recognized in any case&&I respectfully disagree&&No [Millennium Actress](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1033/Sennen_Joyuu) at all? Come on. It's Satoshi Kon's best movie. Then again, I'm in the field that likes Kon's work more than Miyazaki, but it being completely absent from a field of 20 is a joke. Just watch him at work here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHzlOrEYDHY&&""So far."" We still have about 83 years to produce a better movie, you know.&&Secret of Kells takes the cake for me.&&Your Name deserves to be on the list. That movie restored my optimism in the future of the anime industry. I had been disillusioned with the medium since like 2010, but then Your Name came along and blew me away. Shinkai's ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" is also great, and there's definitely an argument to be made for it deserving to be in a Top Animated Films list. 

&&Some movies that aren't in this list that I feel people would think should be there-- trying to not be super subjective (since I know most people aren't as big a fan of Cars as I was)

Summer Wars
The Incredibles
Kubo and the Two Strings
Zootopia
Wolf Children
How to Train Your Dragon
How to Train Your Dragon 2
Inside Out&&Tbh surprised Shrek ain’t on there, I love shrek &&Tokyo Godfathers top's that by far. &&""page one of four""

fuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckofffuckoff&&I'm just gonna leave this here....  
  
*Your Name*....&&In my opinion, it's The Iron Giant&&Can we put a *so far* in the title, my god...&&seems a bit premature to be giving that title away&&Just wanna say there's a recent movie, A Silent Voice, that I think could easily make this list. Would recommend checking it out.&&The film's a masterpiece, and I think Hayao Miyazaki is strangled by that.

I love all of his post-Spirited Away movies. Howl's Moving Castle is one of my favorites, and The Wind Rises is a gorgeous film to look at (although it has the worst English dub I've ever heard). People just want more Spirited Away, when he can tell so many other stories.&&I still remember when I watched Spirited away with my niece when she was 6 years old. Normally she couldn't sit still for more then 15 minutes but this time she was completely enthralled. She snuggled up to me, grabbed my arm and put it around her and she held my hand the entire movie and she didn't say a word. That's such a good memory.&&I don't like the idea of calling anything the ""best"" because it just exists to make headlines and make people angry. There's a lot of amazing animated features that have come out since 2000 and Spirited Away is definitely one but calling it the best when it's among some of the greatest filmmaking if all time is just wrong in my opinion.&&Alot of people love it but ehhh I was never a fan of it. I probably need to rewatch it since it's been so long but I never really understood why people loved it so much.&&""Spirited away is the dark souls of anime."" - IGN&&No The Incredibles, Tokyo Godfathers, or Wolf Children? Lame.&&I wasn't really that into it when I first saw it. In all of Miyazaki's movies, the humans don't communicate with each other like humans actually would, it's very odd... I just couldn't immerse myself in it because of that.&&""Your Name"" blew everything else out of the water and hit number one for me.
Sad it is not on the list, while something like Ratatouille is. While a good film, hardly anything great for Pixar standards.&&It's good, but is it that good ? &&Very happy Shaun the Sheep is there, loved that film.&&I'm amazed Don Hertzfeldt's It's Such a Beautiful Day isn't up there. World of Tomorrow was fun and interesting but It's Such a Beautiful Day is worlds ahead of anything I've watched in animation.&&Wish I loved this movie as much as everyone else. I can tell there's something amazing there, but it didn't really resonate with me as much as I was expecting.&&I find Spirited Away to be overrated. I mean it's good but I don't find it THAT good. Just my opinion.&&[deleted]&&Every time these lists require me to load multiple pages I just read the first and say fuck it.

There is no fucking reason to force me to load more pages other than selling more ad space. You're shitting on your product for a few more dollars and you're losing me as a customer. If it was a continuous lost I might click on another link on your page. &&Wow I'm actually watching this movie right now and decided to check reddit cause the internet disconnected&&Tale of Princess Kaguya, Your Name, Colorful, Time of Eve, Wolf Children, Tokyo Godfathers, In This Corner of the World, Paprika. 

And thats just anime. &&It's really not though but every week reddit has to weeb about it. &&I'll probably get down voted, but I hated _Spirited Away_. A lot of the other movies in the list I can agree with, but not that one. &&No, its Princess Mononoke&&Nigga, we ain't even 20% through the 21st century calm down&&i feel bad for satoshi kon&&When an online list shows you only one or a few entries per page, it decreases my chances of reading the whole article by 100%.&&Wolf childrens was pretty intense.&&Just watched this today after years of not watching it. Watched it with my wife, 10 year old and 2 year old son. They were all so intrigued by the story. Its such a great movie I'm glad I was able to enjoy it with my family so many years laters after my first viewing. &&awww no ""Red Line""? The animation for that movie is just gorgeous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sonTXTZqE-Q &&For me, calling Spirited Away the 'best animated movie of the 21st century' doesn't even do it justice as it's still probably the best movie that I've seen in the 21st century live action films included. Top 5 at the least. &&I disagree. It's got a pretty picture, but there are movies more spectacular visually than it now and its story is nothing special. &&Finding Nemo shouldn't be above UP and WallE. I wouldn't even put it in Pixar's top 5&&Kubo and the Two Strings does not get the love it deserves. &&IMO Your Name and a Silent Voice are much better&&It is a great film, but I enjoy Princess Mononoke so much more. &&No Inside Out???&&But it's actually Wall-E.&&February 27th.  2017 is 16th year in the 21st century.  16% of 365 days = 58.4.  58th day is February 27th.&&In that case... Just make it the best of the 20th century. &&I don't really care about the source a ton, but the use of hyperbole like this shows they are a sham.&&Not even just that, but of the '21st Century'? we are not even one fifth of the way through it yet, how can you say any of these are the best?&&This.  Unpopular opinion here but I didn't really care for it.  Princess Mononoke was much better imo, not to mention plenty of animated films that weren't Miyazaki. &&I like Spirited Away alot, but the best? It's going against the likes of Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wall-E, The Lego Movie, Kubo and the 2 strings (which I think is underrated), Inside out, The Incredibles, How to Train your Dragon, and The Secret of Kells.&&Yeah wtf is Indie Wire and why should I care&&It’s strange, that’s I felt about Kiki’s delivery service, yet I thoroughly enjoyed Kiki much more than Spirited Away. &&For me Whisper of the Heart (mimi wo sumaseba) was that film. Back in college I used to watch it before every semester to remind me to keep following my dreams. 

Omoide no Marnie and Only Yesterday are fantastic and underrated as well, any adult who likes ghibli and hasn’t seen those should get on it. &&Can I just say ghibli fest has been amazing!!! Looking foward to the last film at the end of this month. Im taking a friend and fan of the films who has never seen howls moving castle before.&&I still firmly believe spirited away isn't even the best Miyazaki film. I think the wind rises is much better. It's also the only animated movie to make me cry. &&A great work of art carries meaning for all ages, often differently so. A bet a group of 5, 15, 25, 50, and 80 year olds could all watch spirited away and feel like it was made for gem personally.&&Also give non-Miyazaki Ghibli movies a try. One of my favourites is Karigurashi no Arrietty&&I hate to be that asshole but i watched it a couple of times when i was a kid and i just didnt care as much. Now that i think about it, the simpsons movie was probably more touching to me.&&Lol wait that’s what the movie is about? &&I saw spirited away when I was like 14 and liked it. I rewatched it again when I was 22 and it made me cry. I’m a guy. &&87?&&That opinion is SO 2013. &&You must have fallen into a coma. Happy 2100!&&Like 2 movies came out last year ""Kimi no na wa"" and ""Koe no Katachi"" and many people already believe these films are the best animated films of all time.

There will be more and more films in the future that will keep dethroning each other. It doesn't seem right to say something is the best when there's always more to come.&&I was going to say the judgement might be a bit premature... &&You're doing God's work, thanks!&&Very underrated (and underseen) film honestly, glad to see it mentioned here.&&May I jump on the public domain bandwagon too? It won't make a critic's list but it's a personal favourite of mine. (*Girl meets dragon, girl loses dragon...* - it gives me the weepies, and makes me feel... human)

Animated short [Sintel](https://durian.blender.org/download/) (am providing the link to all-access site and not just to Youtube because of that shitty copyright thing that Sony did back in 2014.)&&Relevant username.&&I know. Where is Pokemon the movie 2000&&I usually agree with this sentiment, bit this might be one of the few lists that might be close to shit. It has really confusing choices - Howl's is a pretty weak film compared to most of the Ghibli output, for example - but is also missing really obvious inclusions like The Incredibles or even Inside Out - despite the fact I hated it.&&Shaun the Sheep but no Wallace and Gromit :(&&World of Tomorrow and It's Such a Beautiful Day are some heavy movies to watch. Definitely needed tissues for those. Hertzfeldt really opens up in a raw and emotional way in those films.&&Secret of Kells and A Town Called Panic... There's great animation being done outside of popular Japanese and American styles. &&Song of the sea?  Secret of kells?&&The Emperor's New Groove is Disney's best film imo&&Woah, happy to see Paprika!&&What about Your Name and a Silent Voice?&&How is Redline not on that list?&&I see no ""Your Name"".  
I feel it's a dreadful shame.  
It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.&&Waltz with Bashir has my vote. Amazing movie. Hit hard as hell&&Woah woah woah, Ratatouille above The Incredibles? I don’t know how I feel about that.&&Yes, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, I cannot stress this enough. It's my favourite film of all time. It's the most emotionally impacted I've ever been by a work of art. It's my favourite score by Joe Hisaishi, and it's what made him my favourite composer of all time. His work in every Ghibli movie is tremendous; some of my other favourites of his are Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Princess Mononoke, and of course Spirited Away. The voice work in both Japanese and English is to me, fantastic. I'm do not understand Japanese to the degree that I would be able to pick out the skill in voice acting, but it was effective for both options nonetheless. It's a beautiful, beautiful story. It's long, and it feels long to me, but it doesn't detract; you just have to be fully invested.

That's not even getting into the artstyle. I won't drone on about it, but I hope that some people get convinced to give it a chance. I can guarantee you'll at least come out affected. 

edit: shit true I didn't even notice Fantastic Mr. Fox there. Another of my favourites, jesus, then The Wind Rises at 5th? And Finding Nemo at 4th? 

I'm comprehending this in a weird order but I agree almost 100% with this list&&The Incredibles not being on this list is a travesty and while Studio Ghibli is obviously great, I have to object to it having more movies in the top 5 than all American animation combined (seriously, how is there only 1 Pixar movie in that top 5?). Also, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not a better movie than every Pixar movie.&&The Tale of Princess Kaguya was such a gorgeous film, but holy shit.  I’ve seen a lot of incredibly sad movies in my day and I appreciate a good movie cry, but this one was so gut-wrenching that I can’t even get myself to think about it.  I’m glad I saw it, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to watch it again.&&I think it's absolutely crazy that both Wall-E and Finding Nemo appear on the list, yet the Incredibles is nowhere to be found...&&*Howl's Moving Castle* is visually impressive, but the plot is weak. Too much Studio Gibli love here, I think. As someone else mentioned, *The Incredibles* should be on any top 20 list.&&Where’s Your Name?&&This list is shit.&&I'm pleased to see The Tale of the Princess Kaguya ranked so highly. It's easily one of Ghibli's best, and certainly top 5 of any animated films this century. 

Purely on an aesthetic level, it's also one of the most beautiful films, period. &&Glad to see 'Waltz with Bashir' on the list.&&Why does everyone like Ratatouille so much? It's in my bottom 5 pixar movies&&I’d personally switch Toy Story 3 and Coraline and bump up Paprika, but it’s not a bad list &&I personally would nudge Rango at least somewhere in that list. It has to be one of the most surreal takes of the western genre ever made.

It's more than just an impressive animated kids film; it's one of the best westerns of this century.&&No How to Train Your Dragon or The Incredibles? This list is invalid.&&[deleted]&&Oh fuck yeah, The Wind Rises never gets any credit, its so good!&&Look for Ponyo...not there = shit list&&I'm seeing a lot of suggestions all over the place... but *Millennium Actress* (2001) is imho one of the best films if the century so far. It's beautiful and should definitely be high up on any list like this. &&Um where's ""How to Train Your Dragon"" (both 1 and 2)? I feel personally attacked.

""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and ""Ratatouille"" are great tho.&&Why is Coraline so low?&&Dang, its hard to 100% agree with a list like this but this would be very close to mine. Toy Story 3 a tad high and replace Shaun the Sheep with Your Name and this would be mine&&Surprised there's no Iron Giant. That's a classic if there ever was one.

edit: Yes, it has been established that it came out in 1999. Thank you.&&No Kubo and the Two Strings?

That's a bad list.&&No redline? Okay then...&&Solid list, I'd probably move triplets of Belleville up a couple spots. &&It made me cry but it wasn't a sad cry. It was a happy cry. No other movie has ever done that to me. For that alone the movie is in my top 5. &&My favourite scene is when haku remembers his name. Goosebumps.&&It’s by far my favorite movie, and I’m not even that into animation. I wish it was easier to convince people to watch it, the film is a timeless work of art but many just think “cartoons for kids” and never pick it up.&&13 years old me was totally blown away too. Also since that time I started to have crushes on animated men. 

I am also very happy for its popularity and what it opened. Anime or japanese animation was hard to find in my country so I am glad this film opened the doors and markets for the general population (before that I believe mostly only people who went to festivals could see many of the art films or cult anime films). Before that only thing I could find was Inuyasha in German. And I could not speak german back then. Well still cant really speak German...

After that, finally even in my country our (well Czechs did, and everyone speaks Czech here), TV picked up these films and translated them, for example Princess Mononoke became super popular too. &&will then, i have to see this movie i guess.
&&Were you absolutely spirited away by *Blown Away*? &&Still my favorite movie of all time.  Gorgeous direction and animation, beautiful and emotionally charged music, a perfect mix of fantasy and dramatic elements, whatever else I can’t think of but want to say right now.  I don’t think anything will ever top it, there’s just so much life and heart and wonder in it.&&I promised myself months and months ago that I'd only allow myself to rewatch Spirited Away after I'd gotten a job. Watched it two days ago, plus all the making-of videos. Cried a bunch. It was great.&&I don't even remember the first time I saw it but my sister and I grew up watching it like once a week, and that DVD was ruined. It definitely gave me an appreciation for film and animation at such a young age.&&I remember watching it late in the night when I was really little (maybe seven years old, which would have been 2009), and I was so terrified that I refused to get out from my blanket and turn off the TV. Eventually I did it in a mad sprint before rushing back to the blanket.

I must have watch a little of these things when I was little, because I remember Castle in the Sky having that whimsical feeling that you can't really describe, though I barely remember the plot. Hmmmm . . . this whole thing feels like a strange blur.&&of course not. Finding Nemo is fun, But Wall-E is brilliant.&&That is an odd choice. The lack of Inside Out is interesting as well. Finding Nemo had good cultural impact, but as a movie it brought nothing ""new"" to the table. Might as well put Frozen on there if that's the case. &&But dude, surfing turtles. &&They just talked about Ellen, when describing Finding Nemo. As if her accomplishments made the movie that much better.&&[deleted]&&I thought finding Nemo was better than Wall-e (please don't fight me) &&I alternate between Wall-e, Inside Out, and Ratatouille depending on my mood. Though great, Finding Nemo is not a part of that conversation.&&I agree. I like Nemo, its a good movie and I think MOST Pixar fans (certainly not all, everyones different) would probably agree they've only made 1 truly bad movie...but I've always found Nemo to be overrated. It's honestly in the bottom half of my personal Pixar list.

But I know i'm in the minority there and still respect everyone elses opinions, and it's certainly a fine movie regardless.

It's funny how, Cars 2 aside, it seems impossible to truly insult a Pixar movie when saying a certain one is not your favorite. Those guys are too god damn good at making movies.&&I️ absolutely loved Its such a beautiful day, haven’t seen World of Tomorrow, how does it compare?&&[deleted]&&Personal preference for me goes to Tokyo Godfathers&&Have to agree with you. RIP, we lost a huge talent&&Personally I like perfect blue and paprika more than millenium. 

Millenium does have allot of oh shit you can do that moments but for some reason I feel like of his films its the least complete work. I'm not sure why. Maybe it just feels like it exists for the technical details more than the story at least compared to his other films. 

But even outside your industry. Kon is just flat out better than Miyazaki to someone who cares about film. 

My favourite comparison is

> Miyazaki likes to draw things so well that people take notice of how he draws. On top of that he puts a story worth being told.

> Kon draws shit specifically because you can only do it by drawing and tells a story you have to tell with those images to do it justice. 

&&Kon's works feel like live action films to me. Especially Millenium Actress. He was an amazing director. I think Paranoia Agent was his best work though not a feature film of course.&&Kon deserves higher praise than Miyazaki in my opinion, Miyizaki's movies, while often having a message, have continuously shied away from the controversial (The wind rises comes to mind), where as Kon stands up and and presents the bad with the good. Perfect Blue and Tokyo godfather both do a great job of that.&&Gotta check this out, it's like watching numerous paintings animated together, just beautiful.&&If the first 17 are anything to go by, we got a lot to look forward too.&&I also loved Song of the Sea made by the same group. Incredibly beautiful and moving. &&In a similar vein, Over the Garden Wall is a fantastic cartoon.&&Felt like complete fluff to me. Haven’t seen a movie that bored me that much in ages &&Did you try A Silent Voice (2016) or Wolf Children(2012)?

I thought they were both solid contributions to the genre, not quite as spectacular as Your Name, but still decent in their own right.

Though I suppose the fact I can only really pick 3 films in a 7 year period doesn't exactly speak wonders.&&What is it about Your Name that made you feel that way when the industry didn’t?  Genuinely curious, I’m also disillusioned with the modern industry, but I’m not sure if Your Name could help me with that. &&It was beautiful, it blew me away. Restored my faith in the medium. Not to mention beat Spirited Away in top Grossing anime movies of all time. &&How To Train Your Dragon was my favorite movie for a long time, and it’s still in my top five. And The Incredibles definitely belongs on the list. &&How was Kubo? Worth a watch? I loved Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away but never got into much beyond that.&&As much as I loved Kubo and it was an absolutely stunning film, o feel it lacked much substance to the story, maybe I need to go back and watch it but nothing about the story sticks out to me at all, just the animation&&maybe the chain of progressively worse sequels affected their opinion on the whole franchise.&&It is a classic. The way Shrek and Donkey are so emblematic of Myers and Murphey with all the physical body comedy being translated onto animated screen. Shrek and movies like it definitely gave the whole family something to enjoy together.&&It hasn't aged well. Its chock full of absolutely dated pop culture references. &&It was actually released just before the turn of the century, 1999.

Excellent movie though.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1811  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/44473)&&For me:

* It's gorgeously animated.  Such vibrant colors, scenic vistas, wild characters with vivid emotions.

* It's different.  There's just no Western animation like it.

* At it's heart, it's a beautiful story about a girl growing up.&&Yeah the high pitched voice precocious child is like a knife to my ears. There is too much innocence and sugary sweetness in most ghibli movies for my taste. &&Yea I watched Princess Mononoke in theaters and it was so much better than Spirited Away imo. I guess it depends on the person.&&Ratatouille deserves it's place too. Couldn't agree more about Your Name tho.&&I loved ""Your Name"" when I first saw it but going back to it a year later, it's a little bland beneath the visuals.&&The scene in the restaurant is an absolutely masterpiece. It had me in stitches ever time I watch it.&&1997.&&I mean we are barely 1/5th into said century so we'll see.

The Times had a list (from June) where thesy [ranked](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/movies/the-25-best-films-of-the-21st-century.html?mtrref=www.google.de&gwh=838C6466CF1E3E033E1D83BED757D194&gwt=pay) their best 25 movies of the 21st Century so far which had *Spirited Away* on No.2 behind *There will be Blood* on No.1 which I think is fair, the only other animated movie on that list is *Inside Out*.&&recency bias&&You just want someone to comment r/theydidthemath&&>  2017 is 16th year in the 21st century

Wouldn't it be the 17th since 2001 is the 1st?&&Only a sith deals in absolutes&&The be fair it looks like OP made it into one, the name of the article is “The Best Animated Films of the 21st Century Ranked, From ‘Anomalisa’ to ‘Spirited Away’”.&&It's an opinion article, not news. You can disagree but it's not like they've transgressed on some tenet of journalistic integrity.&&While I do detest hyberbole used in an article attempting to be informative ""Spirited Away"" and other Studio Ghibli titles *are* largely creditied with popularizing feature length Japanese animation here in America and ""Spirited Away"" particularly is often cited as one of the best movies to have been produced. This of course is skewed data by people who survive under the dilusion that anything foreign is automatically better and people not citing reasons why but just saying ""Spirited Away is the best ever"".

I personally can say that it is within my top 3 favorite movies, animated or otherwise. The scenes are colorful and imaginitive, not a single detail feels out of place. The movement and interactions with the world around the characters feels fluid and graceful. The world building is enough to get the imagination going without smothering it in information. The story progresses at an odd pace, but not a bad one. It feels almost like a fairy tail instead of just another movie. The voice acting for both the sub and dub are excellent and the dialogue itself has emotion behind it. The overall tone of the movie is a bit dark, and I feel that it is excellently played out in this seemingly happy and colorful world.&&It's not hyperbole if they are making a case for it to actually be the best animated film. &&Well we’re not comparing it to the animated films of 2067, I’m pretty sure the implication is “so far.”&&eh it's just a better way of saying ""of the last 17 years"". I don't really dislike it&&I mean... The films that haven't been made yet, haven't been made yet. So they aren't of any century, yet.&&>  Princess Mononoke was much better imo

Maybe, but it was made in another century...&&I still believe Howls Moving Castle doesn't get anywhere near enough credit&&I also prefer Princess Mononoke over Spirited Away but PM is from the 20th century. I don't really disagree with Spirited Away being the best animated movie of all time, it's definitely up there, i just don't like the way the title is written. Makes it seem like this is the definite list when it's just another list of this kind.&&Mononoke is one of Miyazaki’s best, but Spirited Away just has so much more emotion and energy (that resonates with me, at least).&&Spirited Away had such a magical feeling to it that it's almost impossible for me to describe.&&Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name) stands out to me. I would give that my vote if there was a poll&&I think that might be because Kiki is just absolutely charming top to bottom. There's no real conflict, all the locations are beautiful, and the music provides a wonderfully chipper background to it all. &&i remember not understanding aspects of kiki when i was younger.

**SPOILERS BELOW**

like what she was feeling, exactly, after the granddaughter didn't like the fish pot pie. and why her cat never spoke to her again.

**END SPOILERS**

I'm glad i rewatched that one with adult eyes.&&I just rewatched that last week because a friend hadn't seen it. I had first seen it in my early teens, and am now in my late twenties. 

It remarkable how much of an impact it made the second time around. I picked up on themes of depression, imposter syndrome, growing apart from friends, etc., that I never noticed on my first viewing because I hadn't experienced those things yet. &&I think Spirited Away is an absolutely amazing film, but Kiki's Delivery Service is my favorite because it's one of the best coming of age movies out there. It's also really enjoyable to watch because it doesn't get as dark as Spirited Away and you can't beat Phil Hartman as a grumpy cat.&&Kiki is more about work in a positive sense. Spirited away is about capitalist exploitation.&&I've watched many, if not all, of the films and I feel that From Up on Poppy Hill is the tippy-top of the list. Not only was it beautiful, it had an amazing soundtrack and a beautiful story about war torn families in post WWII Japan.

For anyone who hasn't watched it, I *cannot* recommend it more. &&Am in college. I watch Whisper of the Heart whenever I feel like burning out. &&Shit, I need this right now... I'll have to check it out. I don't know how I haven't seen it yet. Also, Porco Rosso is amazing.&&Whats ghibli fest?&&I watched it exactly once when I was a kid, and was so goddamn terrified by the scene of Noface crawling down the stairs while vomiting forth a literal river of bile that I refused to eat Chinese food for at least a year. &&Gotta have a few extra years to fully analyze 100 years worth of animated movies. &&2017 plus 87 is 2104 minus 4 that's 2100 quick maffs&&r/theydidthemathwrong&&In all fairness, they did say ""i dunno""...&&I don't know how underrated it is if it's been declared one of the top twenty animated films of the century, has a 7.7/10 on IMDb, 93/100 on Metacritic, and 100% on Rotten Tomatoes...&&Yeah...Sintel is pretty brutal.  I saw it a long time ago and didn't know what it was about going in.  Was not expecting that.&&kinda wtf list, the curse of the were-rabbit is brilliant&&Awww. The bounce has gone from his bungee.&&And no Kubo and the Two Strings&&The good ones were all in the wrong century&&i seriously think that It's Such a Beautiful Day might be my favorite film&&It's Such a Beautiful Day is a movie I just stumbled on Netflix one night while stoned. I recognized the animation from Rejected and Billy's Balloon so I was expecting something light and silly.

Oh my god did I get a heavy experience. I had to revisit it the next day again and it just blew me away.

Where is Song of the Sea!?!?!?!?!&&Not a popular opinion, but i'm with you.&&It's really hard to believe it is a Disney movie, especially at the time it came out. Absolutely fantastic movie though. I am always shocked that it is all but forgotten. I was at Disney recently and didn't see a single reference or gift related to it.&&Not sure about it being Disney´s best movie, but it definitely deserves a lot more attention.&&Certainly underrated. It's right up there with Brother Bear for me.&&“This is Ysma. Living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the earth”&&me too. 

Satoshi Kon is one of the all time greats of animation. I'd argue Tokyo Godfathers and Millennium Actress could easily be in this list too.&&And Wolf Children.

That film is beyond words. &&That day you hesitate to upvote a smart comment because of the username.

I hope A silent voice and Your name will get the attention they deserve one day.&&Thank You. Your Name blows 85% of that list away. &&Just the fact that Kimi No Na Wa is currently the highest grossing anime film of all time should put it on that list.

Where it should be is subjective but I think that if nothing else it might be the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. It's a movie that I find is best to appreciate by not talking about it very much and I say that as a person who loves to talk movies to death.&&Your Name definitely (although looking back on it it's not nearly as good as I thought a year ago) but a Silent Voice didn't adapt very well to a movie format (too many extraneous characters, an emotionally exhausting climax every ten minutes, missing the ending, etc), although it was still very good.&&And Summer Wars too.&&I feel like a huge part of that movie's appeal is that they took full advantage of the art form. The fact that it was animated allowed for the creators' imaginations to really show. Unfortunately, that's all Redline was. It's flaws are numerous and the story and characters cannot stand on their own without the art making them worthwhile to watch. It's an experience more than a story. &&I've come to the conclusion that Redline's sweet spot is a really niche audience. It's one of my all-time favourite animated movies, but I've recommended it to a lot of friends and few loved it as much as I do.
I've had people tell me it's ugly, the story is lame, etc. I guess if you're not too much into japanese animation and got no interest in racing, you'll probably hate it.&&Had to scroll a lot to see this comment.

&&I think I'd take Kung Fu Panda if I was gonna pick a DreamWorks movie. Or maybe Shrek 2.

It doesn't belong anywhere near a list of top ten animated films.&&Kubo is a great film but I definitely wouldn't put it top 20 or even top 30.&&I still cry a sad cry when Chihiro wakes up dazed and in sluggish shock from her first night in the spirit village, and then she is taken aside in a field and fed a rice ball, and the awakening of her stomach and her hunger brings all her fears and longing for her parents to the surface again, and she cries so hard she shakes, and then she can get on with her adventure and learn new things, she's processed her fear. It's the most realistic depiction of child psychology I've seen in any animated movie, and most live-action movies.&&Me too. As did Totoro. As did Whisper of the Heart. 

I could survive the plot, characters and animation but it's the *score* that tips me over the edge.

Damn you Joe Hisaishi you magnificent bastard.&&Same. I just watched Wolf Children and while it's a very different movie, I was just as consumed by emotions at the end. You should give it a shot!&&His name was Goosebumps?&&This. I get chills and misty eyed every single time. &&Yup, this is the one. I. Lose. My. Shit. Every. Time. It's one of those mysterious cries where youre having this internal dialogue like, ""Why the fuck am I crying right now??"" because it's just such a crescendo of emotions, some sad and some happy and it just leaves me feeling a way very few things are able to make me feel. &&Tell them it won the best foreign film outright. I find that usually helps. &&Please don’t go into it with all the hype, because it’ll just ruin it.  Hype ruins everything.  Just go in to with the expectation that it’s a movie&&A lot of people myself included really hated Inside out. It was a divisive movie not a surprise they left it out.&&Inside Out was okay, but an entire film about characters who only have one character trait is a concept that even the best writing can't excuse. &&I actually think it is.  Up is super uneven; it starts out brilliantly with the intro which could work as its own short movie.  But every successive act is a little worse than the one before until it reaches its kind of stupid finale.&&Up starts well but gets silly.&&It's definitely very good but it's shorter and more rapid fire in its delivery. It does the same amazing task of overwhelming the viewer with philosophical topics that make you feel profoundly sad but for reasons you can't quite vocalize. It's a little less personal than Beautiful Day and doesn't completely reduce you to tears like it does (it might for you though I guess) but its incredibly powerful in much of the same way I'd say. Definitely worth watching &&Curious, what makes Millennium Actress amazing for you? I really like all of Kon's movies, but MA didn't do much for me. &&I like that comparison.

I feel like Satoshi Kon is enough to single-handedly validate the whole medium. If anyone doesn't see value in animation I'd have them watch his movies, because they show what great things animation can accomplish that non-animated movies can't.

Ghibli thrives on great skill and emotion. Kon thrives on artistic vision and innovation strong enough to make his work not only some of the most important animation, but also belonging to the most important work in film in general. 

(In my opinion, of course. I don't believe movies can be evaluated objectively.)&&> while often having a message, have continuously shied away from the controversial (The wind rises comes to mind)

Are we thinking of the same movie?  [Wind Rises was lambasted for being anti-japanese, anti-war, pro-war, morally irresponsible, and so on,](https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/23/5337826/the-wind-rises-the-beauty-and-controversy-of-miyazakis-final-film) as is Miyazaki’s body of work in general.

&&I think something about the sheer accesibility of Ghibli movies are what make them so popular. They are often, if not always, innocent enough for kids to watch, but meaningful enough that adults can also get a greater message out of them, too. Kon's work is also very good, but much more adult-oriented, and so it's harder to get out there, I think. I love both of them, for lots of different reasons, and they both use the medium of animation well (:&&'Song of the Sea' and 'The Rabbi's Cat' would be my top two.&&Haven't seen A Silent Voice yet, but I've seen and super enjoyed Wolf Children. I remember that right after finishing the movie, I went on YouTube to see if there were any videos talking about the lateral tracking shot. And that's how I found EveryFrameAPainting :p&&Your Name pretty much struck a perfect balance between accessibility and intimacy. Compared to Shinkai's previous films, Your Name is his most accessible, especially emotionally. The same themes of distance, awe, longing, etc., are present like in his other movies, but the way he presents them here doesn't require the audience to enter a deep melancholy, like he did in 5 Centimeters Per Second. And that requirement didn't resonate with a lot of people, which is understandable. 

But in Your Name, I think despite the increased emotional accessibility, the power of those themes isn't lessened, but are actually heightened. Like although the story isn't as personal (Your Name sort of feels like an epic imo), it somehow feels even more intimate. 

&&If you adjust for inflation, Spirited Away is actually still the highest grossing. &&I thought the second HTTYD was even better than the first, which is quite impressive considering how good the first one was&&Kubo is was fantastic. It's not a Miyazaki film-- it's made by the people who made Coraline, Paranorman, and Box Trolls. But it has a beautiful Asian feel to it. It's kind of like Laika did a movie with a Miyazaki feel. &&Was my favourite film of last year, for what it's worth. It's stunning. And should make the list for one scene alone, which I wont ruin, but what they achieved in stop motion with this film is beyond impressive. Dat skeleton!&&I thought the story was pretty awesome.&&Aw dude shrek 2 was so dope&&Wait. Are you saying smash mouth is dated? &&I watched it as a kid and I loved the hell out of it. I had no idea there were any cultural references at all until like 10+ years down the line. Film's good.&&The characters feel more natural and organic.  They act much more like real humans, at least in the little nuances they’re given.  The fantasy elements are also beautifully done and feel different from any other type of fantasy you can find, which heightens that sense of wonder and mystery in a way few other things can come close to.

There’s a few really good videos on Miyazaki’s body of work and what makes them so special, my favorite being [this one from Channel Criswell.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=52raDbtNpa4)  Spirited Away is, I feel, Miyazaki in his most distilled form, with all the naturalistic character writing and eye for the beautiful concentrated into this movie.&&The first and third point could literally describe most of Disney's animated movies.&&>it's a little bland beneath the visuals.

[I disagree](https://youtu.be/poBqr-Sex18), there's a lot to unpack in the narrative and how it ties into religion. &&Why do people keep saying this?

It was disappointing.&&Same. It's just so much more whimsical imo. Granted, Spirited Away was always the go-to animated movie whenever someone wanted to watch Miyazaki when I was younger so I got really sick of it.&&Howl's is cute, but Spirited Away has a much better story (Sorry Dianna Jones)&&I don't think Pom Poko gets enough credit. 

They literally have magical ballsacks. It's amazing.&&My favorite too. I had trouble getting a fellow Miyazaki fan to watch Mononoke. She always stopped at the decapitation part. His films aren't known for violence.&&I feel exactly the opposite way. The themes surrounding loss of nature in ""Princess Mononoke"" really struck a chord with me, moreso than the *Alice in Wonderland*-type story of ""Sprited Away."" 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&&Kiki’s delivery service is my cinematic anti-depressant. A bottle of wine+Chinese take out+KDS have lifted me from some emotional lows a few times.&&My Neighbour Totoro is the only movie I can think of with *no* conflict. Kiki's still has some characters that don't like her because she's a witch.

edit: OK, to be fair, the younger daughter going missing could be seen as man vs. nature maybe? But it's still a stretch and she's not missing for that long.&&There is real conflict. Within Kiki. The most difficult to capture conflict of them all.&&There is an international edition were the cat does speak to her again, but that was an ending mandated by the distributors and certainly against the original intention by the director.
The reason she can't understand him anymore is because she has grown, she's no longer a kid, she's beginning a life as an independent woman and the cat is part of a past that she must leave behind. Miyazaki deals with that theme in several movies, take Ponyo and Spirited Away for example. Growing up is leaving behind people, experiences and friends. The cat is part of that, something she no longer is.
Miyazaki has a very profound and adult way of filming coming of age stories. That's part of what makes him a unique author.&&i've always been kinda sad that her kitter doesn't talk to her anymore :(&&Or Kiki's Delivery Service. &&In theaters across america they have been showing some of the movies for a few nights every month.

Honestly, I thought it was very good, but Reddit had made my expectations way too high.&&I'm partial to Summer Wars too.&&What's wrong with traps :(&&I liked a Silent Voice way more. It just resonates so much more. 

Your Name tells a wonderful story, but it doesn't have the same impact.
&&which is literally impossible to have an objective list&&I definitely wouldn’t consider it Pixar’s best movie (I’d put Ratatouille, Toy Story 2, Up, and possibly WALL-E above it). I just think it definitely is one of the 20 best animated movies of the 21st century so far.&&You liked the third book?

I liked Castle in the sky but wasn't fond of the third book&&I am so happy people are up voting you. &&I have to agree. I went into the movie with high hopes and I left a bit nonplussed. It was gorgeous but thin. It touched on ideas of stories, legacy, and family but ultimately I felt like it didn't have much to say on the topics. Same with the characters. They were fine, but I didn't love any of them.&&That was rough for her. My happy cry was when she left with No-Face and the baby from Zeniba's house. I agree she went through so much that when she met Zeniba & started calling her ""Granny"", it was like she finally found family in the strange foreign land. When she said goodbye to Zeniba, it wasn't sad but such a sweet scene that I was smiling & started crying. I was so happy for Chihiro because she had grown so much after everything. 


Now I will watch that movie tonight.&&Also, during that scene [One Summer's Day](https://youtu.be/d1ni1sVCgEk) is playing and it's absolutely beautiful.  Joe Hisaishi is as much of a gift to the world as Hayao Miyazaki.&&This is my favourite scene by far! I could relate so good with it an everything about this situation is non threatening and gentle. Its the essence of what we wish for to deal with the problems of life.&&Care to explain why you hated it?&&They are clearly more complex than that if you watch the movie. Their main emotion is dominant but they have scenes where they have to reconcile the way they feel/think they should be (i.e. Joy and being Joyous) with how they want to be in the moment (Joy with Bing Bong, or frustrated with Sadness).&&That's how I feel about *Wall-E*, honestly. It's a pretty stellar opening that throws back to silent films and classic sci-fi, then turns into an extended fat joke.&&I really like 5 Centimeters Per Second, and I liked Your Name at least as much (especially the traditional folklore thrown in).

Still, I feel like Shinkai's movies are a bit lacking in substance. They are great journeys of love and longing while you watch them, but it kind of washes over you and not too much sticks. From 5 Centimeters Per Second at least the train ride stuck with me and is something I remember somewhat regularly, but despite how much I enjoyed Your Name I never find myself thinking about it. 

Shinkai's movies are purely emotional and visual without ever really attempting to stimulate your brain.

(I want to note that I still really enjoy his work and look forward to whatever comes next. It's criticism on a high level.)&&You mean the best shrek? &&I've watched Spirited Away countless times and I feel like I've been wowed each time by something new within the movie. The last time I watched it, I loved how well Miyazaki captures childhood - Chihiro followed her parents into the tunnel and something about the freaking camera angle of all things gave me this nostalgia for being a kid. Miyazaki's captured human nuance in his movies in a way that plenty of top live-action directors can't hope to achieve. He has [this interview with Roger Ebert](https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hayao-miyazaki-interview) where they talk about ""ma"" and it gives a lot of insight into his artistic vision. &&I didn't say that's what made it unique (point two is basically that), just those are reasons that I enjoy it.&&One of the dumbest lines in history. &&Captain, this is highly unusual.&&People on here get annoyed at the most inane shit in the world.

I want to thank you from thew bottom of my heart for using this word and not the other one which I will not mention here.&&Ghost in the Shell for one. &&I agree 100%, everyone always talks about Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke or Howl's. I never hear anyone mention Castle in the Sky when talking about Ghibli, but it's so good.&&I'm new to Ghibli films, having just started watching my way through them with my kids. (I knew they existed but felt no major pull to start watching them - I was wrong, they're amazing)

Castle in the Sky is my absolute favourite so far. &&God, that movie is so good, I feel like it just gets mentioned less since it's older.  Best soundtrack on a Miyazaki film imo, incredible work from Joe Hisaishi.&&Whenever that movie is mentioned, I hear the theme song. Haven't heard it in years, but it's damn memorable. &&Castle in the Sky is amazing. So much fun.&&Agreed. Laputa is Miazaki's widely unknown masterpiece.&&When my 5-year-old gets out of the bath, she looks at her fingers and says ""I'm old lady Sophie"" in her best old lady Sophie voice.&&The music from that movie is just insane. 

Also Naussica, might be nothing special in the modern world but the female lead was really fucking cool.&&Porco Rosso thou'&&I'm not actually convinced that Totoro and Kiki are his most popular film, just that as merchandise goes the Totoros and Jiji are the most marketable characters in Ghibli's library.&&I actually see Calcifer plushies all the time in comic book stores!&&That's not fair to the author. The movie got a lot of shit for being almost nothing like the book. 

Also I love the movie, but I will agree that the story wasn't put together as well as Spirited Away.&&Mononoke was my first Miyazaki-- but Spirited Away have become an annual watch for us at the start of every fall. &&Spirited Away transported me into another world. Mononoke was very grounded. It felt like the world we live in now, with similar day-to-day problems. People are assholes, to each other and to the planet. What's new. I can understand why some would prefer the distraction of getting lost in Spirited Away with its themes of family and friendship. 

I personally liked Mononoke more though.&&I love both, but exactly for the reason you mentioned I tend to view Spirited Away as the ""best"" one. The clear theme in Mononoke made it more like a ""captain planet"" episode (albeit a marvelous one), while Spirited Away is an abstract rendition of child-like dreams and worldview. 

Mononoke becomes a sort of known quantity after you watch it, while in Spirited Away you ask more questions than you can answer. Few movies can pull that off really well.&&It manages to capture perfectly a sort of transcendental niceness. None of the characters feel forced or childish, there's none of the mawkishness you'd usually see in films like it, it's just wonderful. &&Cant watch it, the ending [where she cant hear the cat](#spoiler) gets me so damn sad =(&&Then watch Grave of the fireflies to bring you back to reality&&I watched 3 versions of this and I always thought Jiji talked to her at the end. T_T&&Am I misrembering that her mother stated early on that once Kiki had fully grown she wouldn't hear Jiji's voice?&&> There is an international version were the cat does speak to her again

So at least I wasn't imagining things.

I'm sad to learn in most versions he doesn't.&&It's pretty amazing that Studio Ghibli created two of the best movies on that theme within only 5 years or so of each other.&&[deleted]&&Wow! &&I think he might be implying that some similar movies were better fit than others on this particular list.&&For me, Song of the Sea is far and away #1 on the list.   Beautiful, sophisticated, haunting, literary.
&&don't worry, I was surprised as well that they were all released past 2000.

Going to check out P-Model!&&As is tradition.

I've been burned by that too much so I automatically take everything with a grain of salt now. Hyperbole is all too common on here.&&Girl Who Leapt Through Time is better, imo. Half of the plot of Summer Wars is a copy of his Digimon Movie (which I watched first, as a kid), so it didn't reach the same height for me.&&>Your Name tells a wonderful story, but it doesn't have the same impact.

Funny you say that because I feel the exact opposite. A Silent Voice has a more interesting premise but was lackluster in the execution department. You can see watching it that it's adapted from something else as it's missing bits and some stuff just feels crammed into it whereas Your Name on the other hand feels more complete as a movie. What Your Name may have lacked in comparison to ASV, it more than makes it up with superior direction.&&I loved both, but the energy and storytelling in Your Name take it to a whole other level for me.&&That's a nice summary.

I also get misty in ""Nausicaä"", when Nausicaä discovers the subsurface world under the poisonous surface, which has [trees growing up to the surface, absorbing the painful poisons of the world, and then dying from it and turning to fertilizer, cleaning the world.] (https://partofyourworldksu.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tumblr_myh4elckgw1rmvkpdo1_500.gif) Nausicaä lies down and cries from happiness at the sacrifice of the trees, wanting to cure the world.&&It's the music. That theme is amazing.&&That one is savage. Hisaichi's tunes have both torn me to pieces and sent me to the skies, his touch is so incredibly tasteful. His ability to channel nostalgia and a longing for the simplicity and love of childhood, it's hard to experience for me.

The full-orchestral intro of ""Laputa"", where you understand the fates of the Laputans in the animation if you have seen the movie before, it's such a powerful tune.&&Joe Hisaishi is great, [Hana-Bi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwNHYvyWA4) is my personal favorite from him&&Always with me makes me cry evrtim&&Excuse me??

This is the scene that truly captured beauty in both music and visuals.&&I remember watching it late in the night when I was really little (maybe seven years old, which would have been 2009), and I was so terrified that I refused to get out from my blanket and turn off the TV. Eventually I did it in a mad sprint before rushing back to the blanket.

I must have watch a little of these things when I was little, because I remember Castle in the Sky having that whimsical feeling that you can't really describe, though I barely remember the plot. Hmmmm . . . this whole thing feels like a strange blur. Feel's weird, like I'm misremembering everything . . .&&Hmm it was just overall pretty weak, characters were dumb and some scenes were unintentionally hilarious. The scene where Riley is about to Jump the banister but doesn't made me laugh outloud and the scene where Bing Bong Jumps out of the cart wasn't emotional, he was an annoying character at best, and also being that he was made out of pretty much air his sacrifice wouldn't have carried enough force to really push it far enough. A lot of the plot is super dumb like just because someone steals a credit card their Island of family dies.... But then it gets reborn like just a few days later... What was the point of it falling apart if it could just be rebuilt, why do some of the structures last longer than others, why do they never use the transport tube to send the memories back. Why can sadness touch memories to destroy it but Joy has to cry into it. Can the others effect memories if so how. Anyways I dont remember the movie much but this is what I think of it.

Obi Wan was essentially saying that only a Sith would make their fight so black and white.

""If you're not with me, you're my enemy.""

Anakin has drawn a very clear line that leaves no room for Obi Wan. Obi Wan doesn't want to fight Anakin. Obi Wan doesn't want to kill Anakin. But Anakins declaration leaves Obi Wan virtually no other choice. That is what Obi Wan means when he says ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes."" He's saying ""Only a Sith would force us to fight when there are other avenues and possibilities.""
&&It's not a dumb line. 

""Only a sith *deals* in absolutes""

He said that if he had spoken, you'd just want to say ""Shut up, cat!"" 

Side note, if you haven't watched it and you're a Miyazaki fan, you should really check out the documentary. It gives insight into his entire process. He's such an interesting person. https://youtu.be/ATDUP-4Ba_U&&i hate that so much :(&&Watch the original Disney Dub. [He talks again at the end.](#spoiler) I prefer that version, the happy ending.&&Yeah I think in the English dub he does seem to be able to talk again?? I'm gonna go with that version LOL&&I'm honestly glad that those versions exist. I think it's a weird put down in a film that was pretty much completely upbeat the whole way through.&&OMG!

Wow!

Thanks!&&/r/unexpectedRocketLeague&&Calculated. &&Best comment ever.&&I feel like the characters in A Silent Voice are not as developed as they should be. I find myself trying to figure out the motivations of their characters during the movie, and finding it difficult to. Granted, it is still a very good movie, and I know it is difficult to adopt a manga with that much material into a 2-hour film, but Your Name wins for me. &&Your Name's ending made me feel ""That's it?""

It was 2 hours of buildup towards something with very little payoff.
I guess A Silent Voice is harder to swallow for those who've read the manga, things like the movie arc missing, but for your everyday people like me, it wasn't noticable. And while ASV also ended in a fairly ambiguous manner, it had more to tell over the duration of it's 2 hours, so you didn't feel like you watched 2 hours for next to nothing.

Not gonna lie, as the final minutes of Your Name rolled, I was almost certain they are going to troll me with them simply not even recognizing eachother.&&Your Name definitely needed more time though. The relationship between the main characters is the most lacking part of part of the film. They're just suddenly in love.&&Joe Hisaishi is a master.&&So good.&&What?  The comment I replied to was talking about a specific scene where Chihiro is crying and eating the rice balls.  During that scene One Summer's Day is playing.  

The Sixth Station is great and I love it but it wasn't relevant to bring up to the comment I was replying to.  

So excuse you.&&I really like your perspective because its so different from mine. I was 17-18 when the movie came out in cinemas (2002 I think in Germany). There is a universal beauty that we can all grasp about these movies and that is simply wonderful. &&The space water turned him gay.&&In Brazilian Portuguese it's basically translated like that. Obi says ""Only a Sith would think in such an amoral way. I'll do what I must"". Some lines got a lot better with the translation, and this is what Lucas wanted to convey even though sometimes he wasn't able to. Btw, I love dem Prequels.&&I know I don't actually think it's that bad of a line. I loved the prequels as someone who grew up as they were coming out. &&It's weird because it feels like the Jedi were the ones that were ""dealing in absolutes"". Love not allowed, attachment not allowed, emotion not allowed.

Whereas it felt like it was a lot more flexible being a sith.

&&Disney plans on buying everything up soon. &&Disney is planning on buying everything soon, it's their business model &&Nope. But I guess by 2067 some offers would come up.&&It’s fun to lick opinions!&&Even hardcore anime fans seem to sleep on Porco Rosso. &&Yeah I agree 100% it's one of my favorites&&It seems Japanese people love Laputa, Nausicaa (not ghibli but still Miyazaki) and Totoro, with probably Chihiro and Mononoke being a tie for 4th. &&My mom had an unsubbed bootleg when I was a kid, absolutely loved it even without understanding what they were saying.&&You can see the influence in games especially the Final Fantasy series.&&Everyone needs a few traumatic childhood memories.&&Keep everyone away from Grave of the Fireflies(but dont its really good, just ever so slightly traumatic.)&&I have a written warning inside the DVD case.

&&I think it is a rite of passage for kids to watch Grave of the Fireflies.&&You monster&&My neighbor Totoro, the original eye bleach&&I put that movie for the family without knowing about that ""special"" ability . Fun times&&Nausicaa is truly Miyazaki's underrated masterpiece. Probably my favorite film of his. Such a good message. &&I plan to start kids with Mononoke. &&I had never seen Totoro, and I first saw it at age 25.  It makes me feel warm and brings tears to my eyes every time.&&Wait, that's not in the original?

Wow... who makes these choices?&&Are you fucking kidding me?? What the hell, I'm never watching an English dub of a Studio Ghibli film ever again.&&I mean she's a witch. You'd think she'd be able to understand her cat. &&Chat disabled for 3 seconds&&Simple geometry.&&Basically Your Name is a lot more contained, while A Silent Voice has a lot of characters to play off of eachother, but with the exception of maybe two, I feel like everyone got enough time on screen to understand their motivations. 

Kawai was a little and Mashiba very underutilized, but it didn't bother me too much. &&> Your Name's ending made me feel ""That's it?""

Well go watch shinkai's 5cm/s to really know why lots of people were happy with that ending. &&>It was 2 hours of buildup towards something with very little payoff.

Fwiw I don't think that 2 hours was ""build up"" at all. You might have assumed it was building up to something but nobody I talked to saw it that way.

not all foreign movie are like American movies where they show you the guy getting the girl and the final kiss then they're sitting on a meadow and happily ever after. If you wanna talk about ""2 hours of build up and no pay off"" surely you must hate Miyazaki... A lot of his movies just sort of... end&&>I guess A Silent Voice is harder to swallow for those who've read the manga, things like the movie arc missing, but for your everyday people like me, it wasn't noticable. 

Your assumption is off, I haven't read the original. I'm telling you the movie has pacing and focus issues, inherently. I'm the last person you'll hear comparing original to adaptation. I love both movies and they both have different flaws. If Your Name didn't impress you, you missed things that a whole lot of people saw. Doesn't mean it's not there.&&Anakin is a Rapist! infostarwars.com!&&PALPATINE IS A RAPIST

Maybe The Cat Returns gets viewed less often than Howl, or Pom Poko doesn't get the niche cred that Nausicaa does, but they're all pretty well revered as being great films by people that watch a lot of anime.&&Yea and even stuff like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and trails in the sky which i think both have floating islands/cities. Even chrono trigger has one. I love that shit and it can be attributed to my love for Laputa.&&Skies of Arcadia is basically the most miyazaki game that he had nothing to do with.

Oh, hi DVD release&&From what I saw after the credits at a a recent screening of *The Room*, Franco nailed the recreation of the original. I can't wait for him to release it in some capacity.&&Went to an early screening of Disaster Artist, and some of the most well-known moments screen side-by-side with the original footage during the credits. They just did a fantastic job.

I’d love to see the rest of the material.&&No he doesn’t. They don’t have it. It’s bullshit&&22 minutes of it are him screwing into his someone’s navel.&&What a story, James.&&I don't want this released.

I want James Franco to go back and film the other 60ish minutes of the Room and release that!  Why half ass it when you can complete it as it was intended to be.

And hell, you know what big movie star? Make it true to the vision.  I want to see a vampire flying car in your version! &&Should have just shot the entire thing shot for shot. &&I’m excited about this.

My only concern is that The Room phenomenon is stealing focus away from Neil Breen, who is a true master of....something....perhaps everything.

I understand why all the hype is drawing some hate.  But I also don’t understand how a person cannot be fascinated by something like The Room.  It’s like finding a fresh steaming pile of dog shit at the top of a tree.  Dog shit alone isn’t very interesting, but...how in the hell....&&Omg yes please. Franco was born for this role. &&>Plot

>Johnny is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with Lisa, his ""future wife"". Lisa, however, having become dissatisfied with her life and Johnny, seduces his best friend, Mark and the two begin a secret affair. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's influence at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attaches a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover.

>Denny, a neighboring student whom Johnny financially and emotionally supports, has a run-in with an armed drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take into custody. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction. Johnny slowly begins spiraling into a mental haze and calls upon Peter, his and Mark's psychologist friend. Peter alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath which results in Mark, feeling guilty about his and Lisa's affair, briefly trying to murder him.

>At a surprise birthday party for Johnny, one of his friends catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Johnny announces to the guests that he and Lisa are expecting a child, only for Lisa to tell the other guests that she lied about it. At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who attacks Mark.

>After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to carry out leaving him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Johnny has an emotional breakdown, destroying his apartment and committing suicide via gunshot. Hearing the commotion, Denny, Mark and Lisa rush up the stairs to find his body. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark abandoning her. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the police arrive.&&FRANCO, YOURE TEARING ME APAAARTTT FRANCO.&&If they don't it'll be like they're sitting on an atomic bomb.&&It'll be interesting years from now people will debate what's better this or Ed Wood.&&I am pig man.

Breen.  His films are very firmly terrible, but very much authentic.  Double down is my favorite.

I think he must be autistic or something similar, he’s just...off somehow.

Anyhow, his films actually leave me feeling very strange.

And perhaps a drone large enough to handle one is eventually coming.

As per the steadicam, you should read up on [what they did with large format cameras while filming Dunkirk](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-dunkirk-took-imax-cameras-theyd-never-gone-before-1023705).

And i'm sure you could put one on a table with some thought and care about rigging everything correctly; I've seen some creative solutions for camera-use.

Digital cameras have effectively replaced 8 and 16mm film cameras at the ""bottom end"" of the industry, they're very good for people who need to keep costs down and the workflow fast. Even on larger productions, the studios like the faster, cheaper workflow and it's helped push digital as a new standard. And they're fine, but I'll always prefer film. I'd like to see smaller-budget projects go back to using 16mm, Wes Anderson proved it can work really well when he shot Moonrise Kingdom.

As far as video is concerned, I think we really missed out when they ditched Analog systems like Sony's HDVS hardware.&&One above the other, so it’s only 3D if you put your TV in portrait mode and watch it sideways. &&The only way Tommy Wiseau knows how to mount something.

The impact would've likely been far greater had he used it to film Django, as he could have depicted the ""wide openness"" of the South and the Plantations.

But even with that being true, one reason he chose to use UP for the film was that it played out like a stage-play, and using a camera system with such a massively wide aspect ratio allowed him to keep giant portions of ""the stage"" visible, all at once, in single shots.

In any case, the simple fact that a director as popular and ""listened to"" as Tarantino is still using film hardware is enough to make an impact.&&You gotta admit though, the landscape shots from that film (few though they were...) were amazing.&&The way Wiseau intended the movie to be watched. &&No they were [side by side ](https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2015/06/xGIiOpeB-600x400.jpg)

Lighting and workflows were totally different for each platform so when you combine them you just end up with a crappy picture for both systems. Nowadays you could probably tune a high end cinema camera to match the light gathering, dynamic range, and color depth of something like Kodak Vision. Back then HD cams were limited because of comparitvely low resolution, limited color depth, low dynamic range, and different light sensitivity. 

So yeah long story short you couldn't just blend the two images together as if they were largely identical. Maybe if you got a contract company to do it like they do most 3D films nowadays by giving it a depth map in post.

Instead of attracting this much negative press and attention, just simply remove the blackout of LA Times, it's not worth it in the long run.&&I'm glad they are doing this. It is outrageous that Disney would try to pull off such a stunt. If they don't like an LA Times article and it is factually inaccurate, sue. Heck, if it is accurate they can still write a letter to the editor, take out an ad explaining things, go on any number of networks (including their own such as ABC News) to give their side, or give a press release or briefing on the manner. Removing critics from screening to leverage a newspaper is basically saying ""our movies are nothing more than bargaining chips.""&&kinda scary how many people are willing to defend a multi-billion dollar megacorp over journalists.&&This really illustrates the power these content companies have. Access to their content by other media outlets is a big moneymaking exercise. Showing a new trailer or photo from the latest Star Wars draws clicks.

Hard news is a lot more difficult to make money from than things like sports or entertainment coverage.

Disney knows this. So they're leveraging their power of the entertainment side of the media business to get try to quash negative stories on the editorial side. Even worse, DIsney owns a number of media outlets so this also a monopolistic attack on rivals.

It's really scary and all media should band together to fight back. 

But are they willing to forgo the clicks from writing about Star Wars to assert their independence as real news operations?&&See, this is the shit we were worried about if Disney started taking over Fox.

When a company thinks they have all the power they feel like they can do whatever they want. Whether or not the LA Times article was ""unfair"" in their eyes is irrelevant. Disney is trying to shut down free speech and now it is starting to make them look like shit.

Seriously though, doesn’t ANYONE who works at Disney read Reddit?&&TLDR? Also what is the Streisand effect?&&I read it before and sent out the link to others and no one I sent it to even bothered to read. Now with this combined with the information about how Disney is bullying theaters with The Last Jedi the same people are now reading the article and curious to see what Disney is doing.&&I don't think Disney was trying to hide this. In fact this is pretty much happening in every city/county across the country. They are just saying, if you bite the hand that feeds you then you get no reward.&&I just saw a small piece about this in my local newspaper. I live in a small town in Europe. There would be close to zero chance of me finding out about this if Disney didn't throw a tantrum about it.&&The LA Times is doing a series on how Disney has quietly bent the Orange County/City of Anaheim government over a barrel with lots of lucrative infrastructure deals that completely screw over the tax payer.   It's like those publicly financed stadium deals that professional sports teams strong arm local governments into funding despite having millions (if not billions) in liquid capital that they could use to finance their own stupid venues.  However, these deals seem to be even shadier than those stadium deals as apparently no one outside of those local governments had any idea what was going on.

Disney doesn't like the fact that the LA Times has brought this business into the public view and blackballed them from reviewing Disney content as a result.  It appears to have completely backfired as I had no idea the LA Times series existed until some idiot exec at Disney thought it would be a good idea to blackball the LA Times and bring attention to it. &&The article says that Disney exerts a lot of power against the local Anaheim government to get sweet tax breaks and other financial deals, and influences elections to get people on their side elected.

Disney's complaint is that the article is mean. That's it. They've explicitly said that they have no disputes about the facts presented in the article, but that pointing it out does them a disservice.

Edit: My representation of Disney's position is at least partially incorrect.  They did not publicly state that explicitly, and the reason that I stated that they did was based on an incorrect remembering or understanding of the following excerpt from The WaPo's article [""Disney declined to participate in L.A. Times movie preview over stories on company’s Anaheim dealings""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/11/03/disney-declined-to-participate-in-l-a-times-movie-preview-over-stories-on-companys-anaheim-dealings/):

> Given the fierceness of Disney’s response, it surely compiled a Google spreadsheet of errors in the newspaper’s Anaheim series. Right? “Disney’s complaint was not one of accuracy,” Miller tells the Erik Wemple Blog. “It did not ask for a single correction on this series.” So what was the problem? “I think it’s fair to say that Disney strenuously argued for how significant its positive impact on the city of Anaheim has been and we feel that that is reflected in the story.”

I either misremembered or misunderstood who was being quoted in that section.  Miller is, in fact, one of the authors of the LA Times article.&&The city spent 120m building a parking garage that Disney makes $35m a year if only half is filled a day.&&I️ thought the most poignant line was “We have spent millions of dollars improving the lives of Tourists’ children, and not the children of Anaheim.”

I️ live in Santa Clarita (40 mins North of Anaheim) but my brother has lived there 15 years. The truth of that statement is easy to see as soon as you leave the main streets surrounding Disney. The city is in decline. Areas just get more sketchy as time goes by. Crime rates and gang violence are on the rise. 

People are mad. Disney is one of the largest, wealthiest companies in the *world*. The money they are making is insane. So why are they *constantly* getting more tax breaks and deals from the city? Well, quite bluntly, because they pay to lobby for people they can bribe to get into office so the cycle of fucking over everyone else can continue.

While Disney continues to accrue more wealth and power, they are leaving the city of Anaheim to rot.

Disney’s response is along the lines of “but look at all these improvements we’ve made!!” Then they list the newest attractions. But every single thing they name is an improvement that also benefits the park. Maybe that would be fine, but we all know after all the tax breaks and money changes hands, a measly *fraction* of that money lands in the hands of the city.
&&Correct. I was not aware of the LA Times articles about Disney until I heard of this protest and read them.&&>What is this bullshit and are disney exec's stupid as fuck 

I really think the current Disney execs have lost a lot of the vision of the company and are turning it into a cash grab. I mean for fucks sake they pretty much orchestrated for Treasure Planet, a best picture nominated movie with some of the most advanced 2D animation of all time, to bomb at the box office just so they could justify closing the 2D animation studio (this is just a theory, but big if true). Now it looks like their vision is unneeded mostly unwanted live action remakes of all the renaissance movies.  

I think people tend to overlook Disney as being a theme park company who makes happy movies but IIRC they are like the 2nd richest company in America with a lot of subsidiaries you wouldn't even think about like ESPN.&&Disney wants LA Times to keel over and suck its dick.

The general public doesn't care about this. And neither does Disney since everyone here is seeing Marvel/Star Wars movies.&&The thing is that Disney can afford bad press they're massive. Avoiding bad press is only really necessary if you think the damage to your brand will damage your income. It's unlikely that this fiasco will severely affected ticket sales so as a result Disney doesn't really care about being boycotted by these other journos. Disney sees more benefit in making a show of force over future access to their content than to the minimal financial damage they may suffer. If they can demonstrate to journalists that unfavourable coverage will cut off their access that will pay dividends for a long time and give them immunity from the press. Disney doesn't have much to lose here.&&It's not like it's going to affect the success of Last Jedi.&&The awards are bullshit anyway, no one watches a Disney movie because it wins an award, the brands are all bigger than that. Disneys films would sell even if Micky mouse was caught fingering hewey, dewy and Louie in scrooge Mc Ducks money vault. The execs know this, so they are able to play hard ball with people that piss them off. &&How many Disney films have ever won awards, really?

Yup, Disney isn't suing to my knowledge because they would probably lose due to the LA Times being accurate in their reporting.  Thus, they are resorting to this strong arm tactic that has completely blown up in their face.  I didn't know anything about the LA Times series until Disney blackballed them.  Well done, suits.&&I'm not saying what Disney is doing is okay but they have every right to use their property as they see fit.

They don’t make ANY top level decisions, the corporate assholes are the ones who deserve the hate here for being greedy, manipulative scrooges.

Anyone care to elaborate&&Since you live in the area, what would be the repercussions if Disney decided to move Disneyland in the next decade?&&90% of the problem with anaheim is the size and shape of anaheim. It really needs to be broken up into multiple municipalities. 

For those who dont know the area just look at this map.

When WDW was built they made sure to buy enough land that they could always expand and not worry about shitty tourist traps popping up right next to the parks &&That is not how a bond works. The city is responsible for repaying the bond plus interest. The debt is payed off with taxes. Disney got a free parking garage paid for by Anaheim taxpayers.

No responsible government official would approve this, so there are probably kick-backs involved.&&From my read of the articles since the garage is on Disney land (and land they lease) when the transfer is done it will be at no cost or $1 just liket he annual lease. So, basically the city is paying $1.1B in interest, $510m to pay off the bonds, and is paying that on a reduced tax base b/c Disney has negotiated 45 years of tax limites/ abatements. Someone else can/ should double check me on this (I am on mobile and fliping back and forth) but that is my understanding.

Also, arguing the $171.9m in taxes they pay and putting all of that to the bond payments/ interest makes it a net loss. Disney does not exist in a vaccume so they put a demand and load on the general infrastrucure (roads, sewers, water, etc) that are paid for by the city. The extra traffic from visitors (that the city is prevented from taxing per their Disney agreement) now means the citizens of the city have to pay for all of the cost inccurred.

I have not crunched all of the numbers and since we don't have the details it would be difficult to do accuratly but that comes up as a net loss or break even at best. Add on to that the effect of many employees living in other cities but using the roads, infrastructure, etc of the Anehime and paying no taxes (other than sales) and you have a a deeper impact.

Now to me the biggest issue is that this is unfair treatment of the other businesses in the city. Disney effectivly is getting all of its limited tax payments put back as direct investment into their business- a very nice deal that I doubt any (or at least few) other business is getting. So, this is from the liberal side a big business not paying its fair share and from the conservative side government meddling in the free market to pick winners and give unfair advantage. Honestly it bothers me from both sides. &&Scrooge mcduck dives into his swimming pool of gold. &&If they don't care about what the news outlets think, why are they boycotting the LA Times?

Then she filed a very public suit to get the photo removed from the ~~state~~ archives.

This brought widespread attention to the photo, which was identified as her property and shared across the internet, neither of which would've likely happened if she had done nothing.

EDIT: It was a private survey effort to document coastal erosion and raise awareness about the issue. Regardless, there was nothing illegal or improper about the photo and Streisand lost the case. Prior to the lawsuit the picture was accessed only 6 times on the server... and two of those times were from Streisand's own attorneys.&&The attempt to block or prevent something you've done from becoming public knowledge causes it to become public knowledge.&&Disney used their commitment to build in Anaheim as a way to curry favors from the local government in terms of tax exemptions, loans, and essentially free infrastructure.

(Think of when cities fit the bill for part of a sports stadium). Disney got pissy and banned them from their advance screenings, despite not disputing the accusations in these articles.

But the execs at Disney who very rarely make PR mistakes,  just screwed the pooch here.   I knew nothing about this LA Times article but now with all this exposure on sites like Reddit, the public is starting to see what Disney is all about. 

Recently just read an article about how Disney is pushing ridiculous Movie Release contracts on theaters for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. 

I will try to find the post and add it. 

Edit: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7aj7uq/defiant_theater_owners_are_refusing_to_play_star/&&I mean, to an extent your knowledge of the LA Times series isn't important to Disney. Presumably people in Orange County had heard about it, and those are the people that have the power to stop it.  So in that sense, the Disney doesn't care about the Streisand effect, because the damage was likely already done.

But yeah, having a coalition of critics supporting the LA Times is an escalation they probably didn't see coming.&&It's much worse than the stadium deals. The city still gets a good amount of money from the stadiums, even if they still end up losers.

With Disney, they mentioned how the city spent millions building a parking garage that Disney charges $20-45 per spot in it, bringing in at least $38 million a year when just half full. The city only gets $1 per year in rent from Disney. They get tons of great tax benefits from the city and have been trying to get Anaheim to pay for more and more shit for them. 

At least with stadiums, the cities still receive revenue from other events and usually a cut of the concessions.

That is a problem. &&It's a retaliation against their investigative work into Disney's control over Anaheim though.  That's what has people concerned, not the fact their reviews can't come out at specific times.&&This is true, but personally, I think the [""broken window"" theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) applies just as much to abuses to power as it does to other crimes. The best way to discourage massive corruption is to show that even minor corruption is not tolerated.&&Thats not the issue in question. The issue is that Disney is abusing favors from Anaheim for profit, which, as the (ed.) *LAT point out, will likely damage the city in the long run.

I am aware that a Disney buyout of Fox was attempted and recently failed. 

They could get an agreement like they have with Sony for Spider-Man, use of the characters and allowing the use of their characters (contract will be heavily stipulated here) in Fox's X-Men movies. 

Hence how we got Iron Man in Spider-Man:Homecoming and Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil war. &&I see what you're trying to say here, but people wanted this before merger talks were public knowledge. There's also the fact that when two huge companies merge, there isn't a damn thing the consumer can really do about it. Lamenting that maybe I'll get Wolverine in an Avengers movie is the silver lining to a Fox-Disney juggernaut removing their content from everywhere and starting a $19.99/mo streaming service. &&This sub is very pro-Disney (or Disney downvotes any comments critical of them in a pro-disney post - six of one, half a dozen).

A lot of people are going to side with Disney simply because doing otherwise makes them uncomfortable. Enjoying Disney movies makes them feel great about Disney, but accepting this information would make them feel bad about Disney. Not only will they have to spend time and effort to accept that kind of complexity (or spend time and effort just to acquire the skills necessary to accept that kind of complexity), which is a downer, but they can no longer feel unremittingly good about Disney, which decreases their enjoyment of the company's products.

Who the fuck do the LA Times and the City of Anaheim are, anyway, to take away OUR enjoyment? We work fucking hard every day - We deserve a little happiness! It's what makes the absolute grind of our daily lives a little bit better!

What's that? Maybe we should use our technology and sophistication to collectively build a world where every person has the right to their full human potential, rather than accepting that your life as a burden and entertainment a salve? FUCK YOU COMMIE.&&Trumpers, and republicans in general, would rather see the top 1% of earners in this country earn more money than literally anything else.

The morons who vote for them allow the republican jabronis to achieve their sinister goals.&&I think it goes deeper than that tbh.

I’ve noticed a growing trend these last few decades where a large portion of Americans have this toxic obsession with “success” ,  to the point they will defend most any person or entity that can be identified as definitively “American” and was successful. 

The closest approximation I can make is watching an avid sports fan defend their favourite team against any and all criticism that has nothing to do with the sport.

It’s as though that criticism of something a person identifies with or enjoys is subconsciously taken a criticism of the person themselves, and they feel the need to support positions they normally wouldn’t in different circumstances.

&&Eh bob Iger is the one who actually turned disney around and got them out of the big slump...&&Disney has now banned you from advance screenings of their movies.&&Sadly true.  

Disney has become a juggernaut because they had a one-two punch of quality content and strong arm tactics.

It also reminds me of how people view Bill Gates these days.  Sure his philanthropy is great, but they all seem to forget that he and Microsoft didn't exactly earn that fortune from being nice to people.  Strong arm tactics by forcing PC vendors to use their software, wiping out the competition, squashing innovation, etc. etc.&&Then let's tell them:

We still have Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Newport Beach which are economic powerhouses in orange county, but Anaheim is by far the biggest due to Disney with Irvine in a very close second.&&WDW absolutely has that going for it... you feel separate from everything inside those gates.

Disney, in some ways, tries to ""help the city"", (reads as ""act in its best interest,"") such as: trying to reduce crime in the area by paying to be one of the only cities with its own District Attorneys that prosecute only MISDEMEANORS.  This ensures that all of the delinquents kids who got terrible schooling in a part of town with terrible infrastructure don't create any larger problems for the image of the park, i.e.  max convictions for petty crimes!!    It was too depressing for me in the school district and was forced to leave.    
Watching former and current students getting locked up for a small bit of graffiti or even less was the worst part for me. It's one thing not to help the kids by not giving funding, but then throwing them in jail to hide your mistakes... deplorable.  The conditions of some of the neighborhoods are unlike any in Orange County, and are largely manufactured by Disney who has corralled poverty and crime away from any thoroughfares that lead to the park.  And even this is in vain, as prostitutes walk the streets of Harbor in areas just south of the park.

BUT at least they put in those whimsical bus stops that extend well beyond the park area.  Fucking mouse...



Edit: Changed ""sentences"" to ""convictions.""&&You have been banned from Thor: Ragnarok.&&It gets really weird with Disney too because they like to foster a cult like attitude in their workers where despite being paid shit they act just so grateful to be working at Disney.&&Uhh let's see, lots of bad business deals for the city while Disney reaps all the benefit/profits. Did you know, for example, that Anaheim paid for the Mickey and Friends parking structure, and that Disney leases it from the city for $1/year? Disney has asked from 30+ years of exemption from taxes, which would significantly help one of the poorest cities in Orange County. For years the city council was in Disney's pocket but now the citizens see behind the magic and how much they are getting fucked over/out of taxes they RIGHTFULLY deserve; the city council is not (edit: not->now) split 50/50 of those who are backed by Disney and those who support it.&&The city agreed to some unfair deals to get Disney to come to Anaheim.  Time has gone by and It's become clear Anaheim got fleeced in the deals and now they want to renege.&&Basically Anaheim is getting the same treatment cities get from NFL team owners. The difference is that Disney won't be uprooting and moving to another city. Instead, they use their financial influence to seat politicians that vote toward the interests of the park which are almost guaranteed to have a net negative affect on the local taxpayer.&&Essentially Disney was backing/Funding Anaheim politicians that were pro-Disney. Things like tax cuts, and paying 1$/year on a parking garage the city spent 100m plus to build were benefitting the company far more than the city.

A lot of attack ads run in Anaheim are paid for by Disney, against politicians who are anti-Disney, while a lot of the money for PACs are supplied by Disney.

Fox and X-Men is totally different.  For one, they aren't desperate for a hit and the last X-men films (***Apocalypse, Deadpool, Logan***) all made good money. Fox isn't ready to reboot the X-men either and Marvel will want *the* X-Man, Wolverine, above all else.

As far as Fantastic 4, while Fox might be inclined to let Marvel & Feige take a whack at relaunching to have new Avengers, AFAIK they aren't chomping at the bit. Spider-Man is the crown jewel of Marvel and Sony's fumbling of the character was painful for Feige & team to watch.  F4 is far behind Spider-Man, Avengers & X-Men in terms of Marvel branding.

That said, if Fox went to Marvel, they'd probably say yes.

Low general admission and pay-to-Ride basis were centered around the park to make experiences for people. Then the aggressive shift for profits in the late 90s and 2000s (Thank you Michael Eisner) the experience had become more expensive without much to show for it other than little bells and whistl s here and there. And even then they still manage to screw things up for their die hard fans by thinking of short term goals instead of farther reaching long term goals. &&They have money.

They also don't care if they waste 0.001% of their capital to make the LA Times cry in horror at them wasting most of their money **and potentially losing a gigantic lawsuit**.

It's called legal bullying.&&If they could lay off 50% of their staff without hurting revenue they already would have done so. To do it merely to punish the city would be shooting themselves in the foot.&&See, i mentioned this in another reply, but that is an empty threat - because disney has alreday laid off everyone they can without impacting park experience. This is just like when companies complain about minimum wage hikes - a restaurant  already only employs as many people as it needs for the lunch rush - if min wage goes up and the restaurant is still busy, they still NEED all those people. 

Believing a company when it says ""if you raise our costs (but not high enough to exceed our profits), we will lay off people"" is just believing that the company is currently employing people it doesn't need to. That's false. The company has already set labor to maximize profits, there's no extra labor already.  They will do the most profitable thing, which would still be to operate the park, and still be to employ as many people as that takes. they are just mad that the most profitable course of action isn't even MORE profitable, because they wanted a sweet tax break on top of it.

Basically, if disney could run DL with fewer cast members, they would have reduced headcount already. it's an empty threat, even if you're a bad person :) Disneyland cutting its own staff to below what it needs to sustain itself will hurt DISNEY, so they won't do that. they might threaten to do that (just like restaurants all over SV when the min wage hike came down), but it's an empty threat (restaurants are ALL hiring here.)&&> The city needs better negotiators that can recognize that Disney has as much to lose over upturning the apple cart as the city does.

If park attendance stays the same, staffing needs stay the same. it's ridiculous that paying taxes or paying for their own parking garage would cripple the fucking disney corporation, one of the largest most profitable firms in the world. It's equally ridiculous that they could or would offset this with layoffs - if those layoffs would increase profits, disney would do it regardless of the parking lot situation. 

Businesses staff according to needs. Businesses will fight being forced to make less money, and even if they would ultimately accept it, they will posture like any increase to their costs is a death penalty.

in reality, all this whining is over being asked to share a little more fairly. it's always like this - wage increases , taxes, etc. A company will never tell you how much more it could spend and still turn a profit - they want all that money for themselves.&&Eh, I don’t know, Disney is kinda weird. They hire a lot more people than an equivalent competitor in order keep the park experience up to their ridiculously high standards, which arguably is a big reason why they have no real theme park competition, but is also pretty intangible as a dollars and cents benefit. 

I do think think it’s an empty threat, but I also feel like they could lay off a lot of people and still “get by”. Business would probably suffer in the long run though as standards slip. &&Ding ding ding ding ding!

I feel like that's not really staying true to the Broken Window concept though. It's not about ignoring big problems to address smaller ones instead. The idea is that given you are in a clean/good stable state, you act very proactively to address even small issues which help keep you in a good state with less effort. 

Re: the war on drugs, it's more an issue of not having resources to tackle it in its entirety. It's more like the broken window principle is simply not applicable here to begin with, rather than not working. &&Nail tit!

I also recently started buying my perishable groceries at a local supermarket rather than a chain like Albertson's and the prices are only slightly higher with much higher quality products and deli and customer service.  The cashiers know my name and I know their's.  I'm fucking sick of giant chain stores and malls.  I'll hit up Target if I need a cheap product immediately, but with Prime shipping, that is a rare occurrence.  More people need to start shopping at local businesses imo or they are going to disappear.&&I like the creative people who work for Disney.

The corporate people who work for Disney are human garbage. They always have been.

&&Oddly enough, no, the situation kinda resolved itself in the Florida version. In Florida, Disney owns more or less a mini-county, that they have full control over, made up of two municipalities Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista. There was no pre-existing city, Disney bought out all the landowners in the area (in secret, but at whatever the fair market value is for land that wouldn't necessarily be being used for a giant theme park.)

While the reason was that Walt didn't want neighbors profiting from his theme park (which apparently is the case at Disneyland), it has the side effect that nobody's affected by Disney's decisions that isn't part of Disney itself, and the area is mostly tax positive (in that employees pay taxes, and while Disney doesn't pay much, it directly pays for maintaining the most of the area anyway.)

The result is Disney World is fairly uncontroversial, even given its tax breaks. &&Just don't go to the Santa Ana Civic Center. &&Absolutely.&&u sucking? &&It helps more than it hurts usually. My main issue with autocorrect is how every time they update it or if I get a new phone the autocorrect behaves slightly differently.

Continental US trips are pretty similarly priced. Once you get to international visitors the price difference is negligible. In some cases it might even be cheaper for them to go to some of the international parks; New Zealand and Australia are much closer to Hong Kong/Tokyo for example.&&He could be the executive assistant to a CEO&&My boss. He's the head of the company&&I'm sure there must be like a job where you test toilets or how much a plumbing can take&&Hold my beer. &&Um, poop scientists would, duh. &&Yessir. President of the company&&That tends to go for most studios.&&Blame the offerings of the political game, not the players. SoCal can sort this out and push things enough for Disney to relocate future investment to a city willing to pay.

Sounds ridiculous, though it's the norm. Most people don't even realize that Marvel and Star Wars movies are heavily made outside the US, due to tax breaks and subsidies paid by willing governments. &&Needs to be higher up imo. There is a good distinction here between what is happening in CA and how it played out in FL &&i'm ok with that outcome - not paying taxes but footing its own bill for the building and maintenance of the infrastructure. 

that is in stark contrast to anaheim building the infrastructure for disney, then giving it to disney for free, then letting disney get out of the tax obligations that other anaheim businesses must pay.

Also, fuck walt disney for getting pissy about his Anaheim neighbors cashing in. Walt wanted the roads to run to disneyland, but he didn't want the community that paid for the roads?  That just sounds like Walt being overly greedy and pretending his little idea exists in a total vacuum.

I was until now a yearly DLR visitor (I live in Northern California so that's not very extreme.) this whole situation makes me want to deprive disney of as much money as possible. &&I had a suspicion there was a reason I've always known that Walt Disney World was way better than Disneyland.&&Good post.

/s&&Can i just say that starting it with Fantastic Beasts was a terrible idea? Like sure it was a fine movie but it SHOULD have just been about the actual animals in a standalone film and not some underlying plot about Wizard Hitler 1.0 that is obviously now overtaking the whole series of FIVE movies. Like why even bother to start it with Beasts if they’re not even a focus going in to the “sequels”. If they wanted to make a film series about the lore then fine, but they didn’t seem to plan it that well in hindsight. &&*Harry Potter: The Crimes of Voldemort*&&I don't mind the subtitle, but I do think using ""Fantastic Beasts"" is dumb. Probably studio pressure so people understand its a series.&&They could have just chained consecutive titles:

NVM, [here](https://i.imgur.com/z1oeXUz.jpg)&&It's about marketing.  They want people to know that this is the sequel to Fantastic Beasts.&&They're probably keeping the Fantastic Beasts title just so people understand that it's a sequel.  I would have loved if they kept the theme of the movies being named after books from the wizarding world.&&But they've boxed themselves into a corner, narratively speaking. The franchise hero has already been decided as Newt. And Newt was the author of the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. And considering how this book was his life's work, it's gonna be difficult for them to make these movies about the beasts while also creating a satisfying Dumbledore/Grindelwald story. These movies want to be two things at once, and I just don't see how you make good movies this way. &&I was really digging the idea of all the movies being named after famous books in the Harry Potter world. *The Crimes of Grindelwald* definitely fits that, but I agree that tacking on ""Fantastic Beasts"" just doesn't make any sense and ultimately just sounds clunky.

Honestly, I just want to see a movie called *A History of Magic*. Literally just 2 hours of the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Imagine the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, but like 20 times longer. I want that.&&But they always do this.  Just so there's no confusion about what Franchise the movie belongs to. e.g.: Twilight saga, Hunger games saga and Game of Thrones.   Only the first books in those series are titled the series title.  after that they have original titles. especially game of thrones.
 &&Maybe Grindelwald is the fantastic beast 🤔🤔🤔&&Even better: Leta is the reason Newt didn't graduate from Hogwarts since he took the blame for her crime.&&Thanksgiving is American, Leta and the Scamanders are British&&I hope young Voldemort makes a cameo in this or one of its sequels (though nothing too contrived).

FEAR THE OLD BLOOD&&2 Fantastic 2 Beasts&&I'm fine with Johnny Depp in the role but I just wish they went for a different design. It just doesn't look good, it's like he belongs in Mr Freeze's ice palace from Batman & Robin as a waiter or something.

Colin Farrell was great and I'm gutted we won't see him in the sequel. Hopefully he'll star in more big movies.&&I don't think I'm ever gonna get over losing Farrell's Graves to Depps' Grindelwald. We went from a ten to a two in the space of five fucking seconds. Even if they'd insisted on keeping Depp in the role it would have been better to keep Graves on as a secondary antagonist who over the course of Fantastic Beasts is eventually persuaded to sympathise with Grindelwald - that way it would have shown that the Grindelwald ideology was dangerously attractive for a lot of wizards and further hyped up Depp's entrance, which I felt was kinda just thrown in there? &&I think Colin Farrell would have been a fucking amazing Grindelwald tbh.&&I’m so annoyed that Johnny Depp is Gellert Grindelwald. I was so excited when I remembered he was a thing, and then they chose fucking Johnny Depp.
No one bothers to keep the reins in him anymore, which means he’s going to be ridiculously over the top, like he has been for the last fourteen years. I hate it.&&I REAALLY hope they write Graves back in as the *real* Graves. I am not a huge Colin Farrell fan but I have a massive man crush on his character in that film. 

Although I believe I read in an interview somewhere that there are no plans to bring him back. &&Seriously, and that characterization? I always pictured Grindelwald as a sort of Dorian Grey, why are they going for Boo Radley?!&&I don’t know how much involvement Rowling had in the casting, but I’m super disappointed that with Rowling being such a champion of social causes and women’s rights, that they cast a domestic abuser as a lead in this movie. I was almost physically revolted when Farrell turned into Depp at the end of the first movie. &&I have an inside guy who told me that at the end of Fantastic Beasts 2, Jude Law turns into Johnny Depp. 

Spoilers. &&Depp has that star power. He's a household name and unfortunately the In Bruges fan base doesn't produce at the box office like Ol' Jack Sparrow. &&It's like poetry
&&And Dumbledore looks at him but He just stays smugly looking at the camera. Great stuff.&&The story will continue being told with Newt as the primary character. Newt's problem solving skills are a result of his relationships and mastery of magical creatures.&&1. marketing

I've never been taken out of a movie as quickly as when he was revealed. The entire series has had some amazing actors, all of which have been able to disappear into their role. Then out of nowhere BAM good old eccentric Johnny Depp with weird hair again. It was like a gut punch. This is made even worse by the fact that he seems to be nothing like what I understood the character to be. Just...why? I don't even dislike Depp all that much (compared to the hivemind) but he's so out of place here doing the exact thing he is constantly criticized for. Out of anyone in the whole world you could cast as the central villain of these movies it's someone who's overall stock has never been lower. &&#NotMyGrindelwald&&I agree. Colin Farrell was absolutely the MVP of the first film.&&IMO the problem isn't even Depp. He has played other great parts, though he is lately known for his Jack Sparrow. My problem is that they made him LOOK like something from a Burton movie, pulled out of Nightmare Before Christmas or Scissorhands. 

Why the hell is his face all white and his hair so fucking weird? 

Very, very poor design decisions for this kind of movie.&&Since this is the near universal consensus I hope they find a way to bring the 'real' Percival Graves back. Even though he's likely dead. &&Yeah, I’m pretty much done with Johnny Depp. I can’t believe there wasn’t a better choice, even from a marketing standpoint. &&Yeah, he still looks really out of place here.

At least Jacob is coming back?&&Not a popular opinion probably, but i think we should give Depp a chance. I was all for Farell and was a bit disappointed by the casting of Depp at first, but then i remembered his performance in Black Mass. He played a menacing, scary psycho perfectly there. If he brings at least some of that to the movie, i think he'll be fine.&&You are the hero we all needed&&r/FixingMovies&&Honestly looks so much better lol.

I Sympathize with the writers and casting. The plan was always to have the real Grindelwald be somebody else. It kinda sucks that they hit such a home run with Ferrel and then have to move on from him.

I wish they could have just come up with some bogus excuse to have Ferrel continue being Grindelwald going forwards.

Can you imagine Judd Law and and Colin Ferrel's interactions in these roles? Splooge&&When the movie's out could you also fix his face frame by frame?&&He'll be a good Youngledore&&I think when they title these things they think about what people will say at the box office. They know people will just say ""Fantastic Beasts 2"" and the subtitle is just to distinguish it further. I think that's the reason for these convoluted movie titles with the franchise at the beginning. &&I never considered looking at the film title as a book title but, now that I do, I think you're absolutely right, and it works so much better. It seems to fit with the whole narrative of this series. &&I just really liked Colin Farrell in that role.
&&He's a great actor, piece of shit person. What bothers me so much is how vocal JK is about bullying, domestic abuse against women, etc (which I like that she's using her influence for these kinds of topics) but she has ignored this part.

Fantastic beasts and how to cook them&&We already had that. It was called ""Pokemon: The First Movie""&&BRANDING

CONSUMER AWARENESS&&I really want a 'quiddich through the ages' film, personally&&A History of Magic will be too similar to Hogwarts, A History, which will be the next inevitable prequel series. &&They should have done a history of magic franchise where each film was a different historical event. I'm sure JK has 9282932 of these written already. &&Maybe it's because of Grindelwald being a Fantastic Beast in bed?&&The fantastic beasts were really the friends we made along the way. &&I wish Grindelwald was still Colin Farell though. &&Or Dumbledore on Grindelwald.

Either way, it's gonna be sexy. &&Really? I have the opposite impression. Most of the time wand duels in HP were like lasers or laser-bullets being thrown, or the connecting duel of Harry vs Voldemlrt. Only Dumbledore vs Voldemort had unique style and flair. 

But more importantly in FBAWTFT the wand duels/attacks were all again ""laser bullets"" so to say. No style or creativity or distinction between spells. 

I'm actually cautiously optimistic about the Grindelwald duel and am worried it will be boring. Give us more Albus vs Voldemort fuel and less ""Harry/Ron/Hermione hide behind coffee tables and shoot undisclosed spell lasers at enemies"" duels. &&> Youngledore 

I made this&&>That was a movie created to ""build a world"" for future movies rather than tell its own story.

Yep. I'd say it served it's purpose, though. Except for painting itself into the corner that prevents Colin Farrell from continuing as Grindelwald.&&No it's main issue IMO was excessive CGI. It made the world look really hokey and fake and I knew immediately that it wouldn't age nearly as well as the Harry Potter movies.&&I agree and I've always thought that Rowling was much better at building worlds than telling the actual stories. If that makes sense. &&I liked it too, but the film very much felt like a connection of set pieces which ultimately makes it feel like more of a shallow popcorn flick than a rich story compared to Harry Potter. Although I'm sure that's largely due to the difference of adapting a novel vs. writing an entirely new script, but regardless it still felt a bit lackluster when all was said and done. Still looking forward to the next one though hoping that it has found its footing a bit.&&I strongly disagree. I think it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are so many ways the movie could have gone that would have been enjoyable. As it stands, the movie tried to be a combination of dark and whimsical,  but failed at both. Plus, the ""romance"" in the movie was so cringe-worthy I literally had to look away during the prolonged ""good-bye"" scene. Good lord, not all movies need romance and if the actors don't have chemistry...just don't. 

I was hoping for more of a Warehouse 13 type story and instead for a mix of squirrel from ice age shorts (only not as cute or funny) and law and order svu  (only not as compelling and with worse acting and a twist ending that left me feeling annoyed in a bad way). &&Is that your wand, or are you just happy to see me?&&I wonder how overtly they will play this relationship. I mean, J K has clearly stated that they had a relationship of some sort.

The Crimes of Grindelwald 2: The Beasts are Back.

The Beasts are Back 2: Fantastic Beasts 3.&&this guy markets

to be honest film is taking cash grab direction rather than world/characters direction. If it wasn't trying to appeal to as many people as possible then we might still get Farrell as Grindevald (or other actor) and a better title&&But people understood the first one was connected to Harry Potter without Harry Potter in the name&&It pisses me off though. Why does he have to be the hero? Why not set it as a sequel but have Newt be a supporting character. I hate Hollywood sometimes. &&> But they've boxed themselves into a corner, narratively speaking. The franchise hero has already been decided as Newt.

That's why he's saying to drop fantastic beasts. It's okay to have a ""sequel"" change main protagonists, but the fantastic beasts part makes that impossible. 

Imagine if the second one followed grindelwald as the main character and then a third one follows dumbledore. &&I don't think so though, the first movie demonstrated how Newt uses magical creatures to fight the antagonists.  
The plot doesn't really matter, whatever the plot is, Newt will still be encountering and making use of magical creatures, simply as a part of his skillset that helps him advance through the plot.  &&In terms of Game of Thrones, the book series is actually titled A Song of Ice and Fire, with A Game of Thrones being the first book in the series. For the show, HBO just used Game of Thrones, which I do actually prefer.&&The ""Game of Thrones series"" is called A Song of Ice and Fire&&>Even better: Leta is the reason Newt didn't graduate from Hogwarts 

[He probably did graduate thanks to Dumbledore:](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Newton_Scamander)

>In 1913, one of Leta's experiments involving a Jarvey went too far, endangering the life of another student. It also violated laws prohibiting the possession of this creature. Rather than see his good friend expelled, Newt took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place.

>**However, Albus Dumbledore, Newt's Transfiguration teacher at the time, argued strongly on his behalf. It is unclear whether the expulsion was enforced or not, or if it was temporary or permanent. However, he was allowed to keep his wand.**&&Geeze, I almost wonder if Newt originally came to America just to kill himself.  &&What a bitch....&&That would make it even more awkward.&&Tom Riddle was born in Dec 31 1926, just weeks after the events of FB1. Considering that the duel between Albus and Grindelwald doesn't occur until 1945, when Tom is 18, it possible he may show up as a kid or teenager.&&Eddie Redmaynes character sees a small shadow/sliver escape at the end of the tunnel sequence :)&&Del Toro would definitely make this magical... &&Yates has bothered me too.  While I think he generally improved his directing as the movies went on (OotP is my least favorite HP movie), I think he’s stayed far too long and has smothered a lot of the movies’ uniqueness.  He has a sort of drab directing style I don’t like.

That said, I didn’t mind him on Fantastic Beasts.  I feel this is the type of HP movie he’s better at—more whimsical, fewer stakes, lack of a book adaptation to mess up, etc.&&Followed by FANTASTIC B3ASTS&&If Depp had this look

Don't you see? They *are* the Fantastic Beasts.&&I mean, the story is going to be from the viewpoint of Newt and his role in that war. And, since he doesn't seem to be a particularly gifted wizard, he'll probably end up using his beasts.

Granted, the whole premise is a bit wonky. Prequels have that problem because we already know the outcome. And there was already a very successful franchise that featured a villain that was repeatedly called the only baddie badder than Grendelwald. And that badder baddie ended up killing the lesser baddie, anyway.&&*Fantastic Beasts: Second Verse, Same as the First*&&That would be pretty hard to fit on a movie poster. &&The first movie was called Fantastic Beasts, but was partially about politics.

Dumbledore and Voldemort were at a level nobody else was at, it doesn't make sense that they would fight the same way. Alternatively the people with far less ability shouldn't be trying to make grand moves when guerrilla style tactics work better for their ability and needs.&&""FBAWTFT"" has to be the worst acronym I've ever seen. It took me longer to puzzle it out than it would for me to just have read the title.&&I hate this too, it's a trend in many movies about magic. Doctor Strange, for instance, did the same thing. You have fucking *magic*. You can make illusions, use different elements, summon familiars, or induce all manner of ailments on a target. Yet you just shoot the magic equivalent of bullets at each other? Get outta here. Hell, in doctor strange they literally only used the color orange for everything.

Literally my biggest peeve against this movie. *Colin fucking Farell!* Why couldn't he be Grindelwald dammit?&&Here's the problem with the reveal: Colin Farrell was believable as a bad guy. I could suspend my disbelief and buy that he was a wizard and a douchebag. When they did the big reveal, all suspension was broken, because, in the words of my girlfriend: ""is that fucking Johnny Depp?""

Johnny Depp has become such a caricature of himself that I can never see his characters, anymore, I just see Johnny Depp. It's not ""okay, there's this big bad wizard"", it's ""so Johnny Depp is a wizard, now"".&&I really hope Percival Graves was locked in a trunk like Mad Eye Moody.&&I liked it but it gave me mood whiplash like no other film I've ever seen.

I think it laid a good foundation, and the question is what they do with it. I'm hopeful.

(I find this similar to Dr. Strange from the Marvel Universe. It got picked on for being formulaic with a thin plot, but they had to establish the entire magical branch of the Marvel Universe, and in the process they managed to set up interesting future story lines.)&&Yeah, it was definitely thinner story-wise which is a legit criticism but overall I still really enjoyed it, hopefully the sequel will be a bit more rich. &&Time to play ""Put the Sorting Hat on the Slytherin."" -Roger Moore&&https://youtu.be/pEsZkTTgydc?t=25s&&(Doing great) &&Andromeda isn't a Lestrange, though.

Unfortunately Hollywood seems to think it has to cater to the stupidest person in the audience who might not think it’s related to Fantastic Beasts. I’m just glad the original didn’t have a tag line of “Before Harry Potter: Fantastic Beasts...”&&The Fantastic and The Beast&&Fantastic Beasts: Hogsmeade Drift&&The F8 of the Beasts.&&Fantastic Grindelwald: A Harry Potter Story &&Fabulous Beasts and Where to Grind Them&&The only fantastic beasts in that movie are a couple of trouser snakes.&&No no, that would make them *Fabulous* Beasts&&Sort of. In the books they don't get too much more specific with it than the two of them being ""very close"" with one another. As a kid you read it and it comes off like they were just long-time friends who were fiercely loyal to each other, but as an adult you read it and you're like ""I'm about 85% sure they were sucking each other's dicks.""&&Fantastic Beast With Two Backs&&Yes. We got some of it in the first film with Credence’s storyline.&&Dumbledore loved / was infatuated with Grindlewald. Grindlewald recognized this, and took advantage of it to manipulate him. &&>And that badder baddie ended up killing the lesser baddie, anyway.

I want that scene as a mid credit sting in the final Fantastic Beasts flick&&I mean. Would you not consider Harry Potter a good read if you went into it knowing that Voldy would be defeated? It's about the journey. &&Kind of like the X-men reboot jumping directly to apocalypse. We kinda painted ourselves into a corner here.&&> I mean, the story is going to be from the viewpoint of Newt and his role in that war.

And by that you mean that Ellen Ripley is going to beat the sit out of Grindlewald in a power loader?&&The dude has a gigantic world filled with his beasts in his suitcase

He seems pretty gifted&&[Same, but different](https://media.giphy.com/media/C6JQPEUsZUyVq/giphy.gif)&&[Now It's Official.](https://i.imgur.com/90GmMoc.png)&&Fantastic beasts 4: wizard hitler&&Fantastic beasts and the importance of safe sex&&The same reason they bothered putting Hulk in Thor Ragnarok

Alright so we technically cant make a solo Hulk, so you wanna just do like...planet hulk sorta&&Not really. The central conflict of that film really makes it a Captain America movie. Bucky and Steve are the core of that movie. It’s about their friendship, the other Avengers are in there as either the antagonists or as secondary characters. 

The film really focuses Cap and characters directly related to him. Yeah the other Avengers show up but for a majority of them it is in the form of one scene ( albeit a giant scene) at the airport. &&Broke back beasts where Dumbledore just can’t quit Grindlewald. &&Yeah. I would've been fine with no Grindelwald in the movie, just a character who is alluded to. Voldemort was this effective because his first real appearance was 4 books in.&&I'm not sure how well he'd work as a good guy&&> everyone laughed

Same when I saw it, including me. And personally I prefer Farrell as an actor as well. If they'd reversed the casting so Depp was in 90% of the film and Farrell was Secret Wizard Hitler, I'd be way happier with it. &&Yeah Grindelwald was arrogant to the extreme. There is no way he would conceal himself as a police man basically. That work is below him. Also, where on earth did he find the time? Wasn’t he busy taking over Europe? It would make so much more sense if it was one of his followers that he placed there to get the job done.  And Grindelwald was supposed to look like the golden hero, all handsome and stuff. Not like a deranged ice king.&&Why is this the medium Rowling decided to tell Grindelwald's story in? Why is a magizoologist involved in apprehending an ultranationalist terrorist?&&Also Colin Farrell was and would be far better than I think Depp will be. &&In the theater, my initial reaction was ""holy shit is that Johnny Damon?"" Before I realized I had made the classic athlete/actor mixup. &&Wait what about his abuse of Amber Heard? His management supported her claims so that's pretty cut & dry. 

She also gave the divorce settlement to charity. Class act. 

I love HP but I'm not giving money to anything with Johnny Depp in it now, I feel like he got away with that shit. I also love Agatha Christie but I'm not paying to see the orient express cos of him. &&*La Vie d'Albus Percival Wulfric Brian*&&please don't trample all over my heart. that couple is already so tragic even with only the slight hints we've been given, nevermind two hours of them falling desperately in mismatched love&&More like bareback Magic Mountain.&&Diagonback Mountain, no? &&You are out of your gosh farking mind mam or sir. Dumbledore was most definitely a TOP! He played the coy, reluctant lover but oh ho ho! Was he ever a top. I'm completely heterosexual and had to look up the ""top/bottom"" thing, but through deductive reasoning and applied mathamascience I stand to reason that Dumbledore gives not receives, the Dick. And that's with a capital D. Good daye&&Ey cohm'ere. We gotta talk to youse&&Gotta make it sexy&&Wouldn't it be cool if they actually used Transfiguration... ever.&&The flying thing only really made sense if the Death Eaters were in Hogwarts, otherwise why wouldn't they just apparate? 

Newt's running on rooftops and apparating was one of my favourite small things in Fantastic Beasts, hope they stick with that then more clouds with faces. &&That's the other thing I didn't like. In the books it was a big deal that Voldemort could fly then in the movies everyone could. Doubt they'll change it though. &&The ministry fight was so much better adapted to the movies than any of the other duels in the books, it's ridiculous. I was actually pretty stunned that they managed to deliver.&&You're reminding me about all the things I hated in the HP films...&&Yeah Harry and the gang were essentially high school students. They knew how to block and freeze and other ""basics"" in dueling but they couldn't reproduce the truly spectacular magic that Dumbledore or Voldy did. And they shouldn't be expected to. &&It probably wasn't intentional but this is right. Think of karate movies. Real fights don't look that pretty. In a life or death situation, simple techniques are the way to go. &&Yeah but in the books the kids weren't anywhere near the level of the older wizards, but still used a variety of spells that have different appearances and effects. Like, most of the students (and even older people) would use a stunning charm, which is red; but in the movie everyone would just shoot silver lasers at each other. 

Also, eventually in the movies the entire universe knew how to perfectly duel with silent spellcasting apparently...why didn't we get any incantations at the end? 

There's really no disputing that spellcasting in the movies was utterly uncreative or canon. &&But wasn’t Dumbledore basically above Voldy, to the point that Voldy only attacked Hogwarts when he knew Dumbledore would be gone, and especially since Voldemort ran from Dumbledore when it became apparent that Dumbledore would beat him?&&I think fantastic beasts would have sufficed. &&You might find the Dr Stange cameo in Ragnarok encouraging then. He's a lot more... magical in that. He *feels* like the being who dueled a Celestial for an eternity and managed to come out ahead. I'm hoping for more of that in Infinity War.&&>I hate this too, it's a trend in many movies about magic

Problem is, director is still dull David Yates. Who has began using ""magic is just bullets"" in the first place. And who made a wizarding battle of hundreds of wizards the dullest scene right before screwing up main duel&&I mean, I felt like they did a pretty good job with Strange. It's important to first note Strange's magic is very different from Harry Potter's magic. It doesn't have familiars or curses, though certain magics in the Marvel universe do have a more witchcraft flair to them. Additionally, Strange was an utter novice. He was barely able to fashion together portals and could hardly manage to fashion weapons at all. The fight scenes with the Ancient One really showed a master, with her reality bending abilities. But there's almost no comparison to Harry Potter's blaster rifle fights. While Strange's magic isn't very flashy and is definitely more managing raw power than mastering funny words, they still did a great job portraying the magic in accordance to what it's like in the comics. &&Did you somehow miss them literally changing the world around them? How...?!&&Oh, you mean the club that was full of twelve year olds? &&Yeah, I'm so over Johnny Depp. He puts me off movies. I don't know why. &&...maybe we'll get lucky and at the ends of the second movie it will  revealed that Johnny Depp is ACTUALLY COLIN FARRELL! &&My main pet peeve with Johnny Depp was the purple eye and bleach blond hair. I didn't know they had peroxide and Hot Topic in the magical world in 1920s&&Isn't that kind of representative of how we view that era in American history in retrospect? Like it's all flappers and fun and all, until you remember all of the horrible human rights violations.&&That’s why I loved Eddie Redmayne’s portrayal of someone with an atypical neurology. When you’re in the autistic spectrum or suffer from depression/anxiety, you view human relations like a delicate contract that can go sour at the slightest trigger. Newt felt more comfortable being around deadly animals (going as far as being clearly deluded about their safety) than looking people in the eye, because he valued life too much and knew how easy it is to hurt others. And everyday life, especially in a foreign culture, is like walking on eggshells, where one wrong look or apathic comment can ruin a whole day and potentially a whole civilization when indifference and animosity are spread in a massive, collective way.

That was my takeaway anyway.&&Also led to Doctor Strange cameo in Thor Ragnarok which was amazing.&&That's why I enjoyed SS so much as a movie; it established the world while also telling a tight narrative with real stakes and character moments. 

I enjoyed FB for what it was, but I don't think movies should get a free pass for being ""world establishing"" as if that's a purpose for a movie to be made.&&i never excepted it to have a deep story. i just wanted to see some fantastic beasts and possibly learn where to find them. in that department it delivered splendidly. &&You're absolutely right. I forgot about Bellatrix's husband.&&I just realized that Leta is related to Bellatrix by marriage and not directly as a cousin, though, all pure bloods are related to each other, as said in the books&&Let’s not forget about Rambo:

*They were in the closet this whole time!*&&I think it's less that they were actively gay with each other, and more that Dumbledore was a teenager with a crush on Grindelwald, so he was blinded to Grindlewald's evilness early on. &&Rowling also confirmed it. &&Eh, my wife and I were both adults when we read it and neither of us picked up on it. It struck both of us as Rowling wanting the benefit of being progressive without being willing to take any risks. &&In what universe does that come off as gay? I always took it as two people who dreamed of bigger destinies meeting up and becoming friends. For the first time ever, the prodigies found someone just like them. Of course they grew close. Ron and Harry grew close, too, and had just as much gay subtext as Dumbledore and Grindelwald ever did.&&Did they actually show Voldemort killing Grendelwald in the movies? I remember the books and the movie being different, in that regard. IIRC the movie just shows him flying away after Grendelwald told him who had the Elder Wand.&&Well, most stories imply that the bad guy will lose. But we know a lot of the details. We know who will live, how the bad guy will lose, what will happen to him, and so forth and so on.

That said, I'm excited to see the duel. Supposedly the greatest duel in wizarding history. Voldemort may have mastered primitive dark magic, but Grendelwald seems like the equal and opposite of Dumbledore. As we saw, Dumbledoor had no issue dueling Voldemort, but it's implied that his duel with Grendelwald was a true battle of equals.&&The icing on the cake here is the Lord of the Rings font&&WizardAIDS..Is it a Ministry of Magic conspiracy?&&Whatever the reason, result was fantastic hulk beast. Oh hey there’s your title.

Fantastic Beasts: Ragnarok&&This. I hate when people call Civil War, Avengers 2.5. They were literally only in it for the accords talk and the airport fight scene. The rest of the movie was devoted to Bucky, Steve and Tony with one 5 min scene to introduce us to spider-man. &&Dumbledore: ""I wish i knew how to quit you""

Grindelwald: ""OBLIVIATE!""&&It's actually crazy how little Voldemort is in the movies. In the first film he's shown as a spooky hooded man for like a minute and then the back of a head for 5 minutes at the end, in the second it's an image of himself when he was younger, the third he's absent, the fourth he returns at the end for 10 minutes, the fifth he's a presence throughout but only shows up for the final battle, the sixth book he's completely absent and then the Deathly Hallows movies is where he can finally shine.

It's just pretty cool how J.K/the filmmakers didn't rush into showing him, and when he did show up (Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix) it felt satisfying after all the build up. They did a good job making his presence and impact felt throughout the series.&&More like 1 book in.
But it's one of the final chapters so it's the same principal. Voldemort has some good build up.&&Mad-eye 2.0 with more darkness&&Yeah, big laugh when I saw it too. He looks ridiculous, and horribly at odds with the whole aesthetic of the film.&&Exactly what my wife and I said. They totally should have switched them&&> It would make so much more sense if it was one of his followers that he placed there to get the job done.

No shit. If anything having him pose as a policeman (albeit, high ranking) diminishes his power and influence. Like yeh, it's clever and shows off his skills that he could deceive everyone, but can the dude not delegate? Voldemort has heaps of people infiltrating the ministry and shit. &&I mean given that the first film was in the Twenties, they could be being clever and making this Grindelwald's Beer Hall Putsch? 

So he fails and gets imprisoned, but realises he needs to change tactics (in this case going from lone wolf to getting followers)?&&C'est Magique: Une Histoire d'Amour&&*Le Morte d'Albus Dumbleydorre* - by Madame Maxine&&Idk I think albus is a sub power bottom. Only let's you think you have control but he holds all the power and will eat your dick.&&Remember that flames-into-water-into-snakes-into-whips super combo reversal thing Dumby and Voldy had going in their OOTP duel (book version)? Now *that* was awesome. You could truly feel like these were not just duelists, but master magicians at work, and shared the awe of Harry as we observed the whole thing.&&I hate apparating (because I don't understand why anyone would fight and die. Hey Voldemort is here to kill our son! Don't worry I'll stand here in front of him.) and like the smoke/light. That said, I think maybe it can just be a 'apparating is hard' type deal. Not everyone can do it well, so some people would prefer to smoke/light it up, especially when not going so far. Counterpoint, it's even harder than apparating (which is why brooms exist, I know in the books only Snape and Voldy can fly without a broom) so the death eaters do it as a way to show their power, and the good guys make a light version because fuck you we can too.&&Really diminished LVs powers to show all of them doing it. I completely agree with the Newt scene, although it actually made sense.&&And you know it's a big deal, so when Snape does it late in the book you're like ""Daaaaamn Snape!""&&Only Voldemort and Snape could do it in the books. &&I agree compared to the other movies it was very good, but I still feel let down by it because the book duel/battle was so much longer and imo better.

Can’t hold it to the books, though, I guess.  Good scene.&&Well, if my memory serves me right the books do show a lot more variety in the fights, it's just that most of that variety would be too complicated to explain as every spell would have an apparently random effect when it hit someone. I do wish they would have shown at least *some* stuff tho, such as the whip spell on Hermione, from the battle in the Order of the Phoenix&&Yeah but I still found it frustrating that even when we do see other older people use spells there's no creativity to it.

It's still bullet esque spells and stuff.

If literally only the two greatest wizards in modern wizarding Europe can fight with even an ounce of creativity, that's pretty disappointing.&&I think a simple phone call would have sufficed.&&I did see Ragnarok and Strange's cameo was awesome. Hope they build even more for future films.&&Dormammu is a Faltine, not a Celestial. Still a very powerful energy being (especially in his own dimension), but a few rungs of the ladder below Celestials. &&if you compare it with the books though, where rictusempra tickled you until you couldn't move because of laughter (and was strategically used for such), it's pretty dull. &&He constantly plays different ""quirky"" characters and is totally unable to disappear into a role. I thought he was so wrong for Fantastic Beasts because he's an A-lister American celebrity, as opposed to the adult actors in the original HP movies who were famous for their good acting but without the media circus surrounding them. Anything that Johnny Depp does just screams Johnny Depp nowadays and ruins the immersion. 

Edit: To paraphrase a reddit comment I saw when the movie first came out, his costume also makes him look like an extra in a Nazi-themed gay porn shoot.&&Because he doesn't play characters, he plays himself as a character.

If I talk about this movie to anyone, I refer to Eddie Redmayne's character as Newt Scamander (""Newt may not have been the best wizard, but he's great at taming the beasts""), but I referred to the big reveal as Johnny Depp (""so then it turns out the big bad guy is actually Johnny Depp""). And I know that watching the next movie, I'm again going to be able to go ""okay, that's Newt Scamander"", but when Gindlewald shows up, it's still going to be Johnny Depp in my mind.&&https://imgur.com/a/4WNbA&&He's a woman beater&&

He was a lot more ""Dumbledore"" than Richard Harris, who may have looked great but lacked the vitality the Dumbledore in the books had.&&I really liked him in Public Enemies. &&The company is ours!!!&&Fan-two-stic B-two-stics&&A fantastic tale about a bear trying to pass high school chemistry and also be the best tuba player the school had ever seen.&&It's funny because in this case the word wand is being used to refer to a penis however he is also a wizard who uses a magic wand... While also being a fun play on words to resemble his name&&Grind-them-wild.&&That would make sense. It would also add another layer to his motivations against Voldemort; not only is it because he's trying to protect the world from an insanely evil wizard, but his passion for said protection is probably fueled by his understanding of how easily evil can corrupt those with good hearts.

/r/im14andthisisdeep&&I love that you said ""actively gay with each other"" rather than ""in a relationship"" lmao&&Yes, but she also goes to say that Grindelwald wouldn't have reciprocated, and used the knowledge of Dumbedore's infatuation to manipulate him.&&I don't believe Rowling knew Dumbledore was gay when she wrote the books, and I do believe she wanted to make *the books* more progressive/relatable, but I also don't believe she did it to avoid taking risks. I think it is just a matter of hindsight being 20/20. 

The era she wrote the books in wouldn't have been super accepting of a gay character in a children's book. Probably not her publishers either. So I can see the argument that she just didn't want to take the risks. I just think the more likely explanation is that it never crossed her mind to make anybody gay or to make any of the leads black, but then she had endless conversations and read endless commentary by a very diverse fan base and had regrets. So she's attempted to right her own perceived wrongs by diversifying the cast after the fact.

I think she deserves a little bit of credit for caring *now*, even if she's handled it quite sloppily. And of course I wish she had felt this way when writing the books so that it felt more organic (and so that she came off less dishonest now). &&I don't disagree with you. If it weren't for the epilogue in Deathly Hallows I probably could've seen Ron & Harry gettin busy too.

I'm not here to judge, fam. I'm here for the wizard sex.

Like, do you think it's commonplace for wizards and witches to incorporate magic into their intercourse? Obviously it'd be a little difficult because wandless magic isn't exactly something many magic users can do*, but are there wizard fetish cultures around things like the Imperius curse? They've got built-in Furries with the animagi and I would be GOBSMACKED if there weren't a handful of dirty birds who were into that stuff.

I think we can all agree, at the very least, that size complaints from both sides of the aisle would presumably be a thing of the past with all the various types of size and shape manipulation they have at their fingertips.

***E*** * - Just had a thought: Doesn't need to be wandless. I bet there's a shit ton of spells that make wands vibrate and change temperature and all sorts of stuff. Plus you could just bewitch an item you have on hand to behave however you want it to. THINK OF ALL THE MONEY WIZARDS SAVE ON BATTERIES. Then again wands aren't inexpensive so maybe you don't wanna be putting one in warm, potentially wet places too often where they could be snapped by one good bodily twitch.&&99% sure you're right&&> but it's implied that his duel with Grendelwald was a true battle of equals.

Dumbledore won when Grindelwald had the elder wand. It was by no means a battle of equals. 

Dumbledore is John Wick to Grindelwald's Viggo Tarasov.&&In a surprise twist Grindelwald's polyjuice wears off AGAIN in the last 10 minutes, revealing Surtur, who proceeds to ravage New York.&&It really is in every sense a direct sequel to The Winter Soldier. It directly addresses Cap and Bucky and where they left off. I cannot stand how people call it Avengers 2.5. The film has literally nothing to do with the Avengers as a team other than them splintering off into two groups as a result of Bucky and his supposed terrorist attack. &&That's the good thing about him; he's a constant presence, he gets character development throughout the series, and he doesn't show up so often that he overstays his welcome or starts to feel like a non-threat. 

The series has no shortage of problems but a great villain certainly isn't one of them. ^(the movies have considerably more of those)&&The way he kind of pedo-whispered his lines bugged me too. Granted the great thing about your imagination is you can make things sound however you want, but I can't help thinking about him whispering [""do you think you can hold me?""](https://youtu.be/hPNqE1CX95w?t=3m41s) and how much more frankly *menacing* it would sound coming out of Farrell's mouth. &&I’m smiling ear to ear at the fact that I’m discussing Harry Potter in a serious, analytically way for the first time in like five years. I used to talk about this stuff all day with my brother when we were kids!&&Yeah my first reaction was that an egomaniac like Grindelwald would never stoop to interact with blue collar workers. I’m honestly very surprised that JK signed off on that. And the casting of Johnny Depp. I love Pirates of the Caribbean as much as the next guy but boy was that a poor casting decision. Especially with him being a wife beater and all...&&Yeah, but Voldemort was also bigger, better, and badder. If Grindelwald had been as good/smart/strong as Voldemort he wouldn't have ended up locked up in a tower.  

Then again, Voldemort died to a fucking baby from the power of *love*, so who the fuck knows. 

It sounds like an anime plot written out like that. &&To provide a counter point, one of the better duels in the series is the Harry and Draco [Sectumsempta battle.](https://youtu.be/rH-7IPqJPXk) You don't get the long, drawn out wand clashing thing, but you do get a case of the wand bullets, that I think works in this case just because of how dirty the scene feels.

It also gives me one of my favorite [pictures](https://i.imgur.com/sEaKKiX.jpg) from the series.&&damn, now I want to read the books again&&That reminds me of the Reddit post a while ago about arguing that Harry's generation was by far the weakest users of magic. Their parents created new spells, created the Marauder's map, etc. Meanwhile Harry was somehow ahead of the curve by just getting his patronus correct&&I agree. Doctor Strange had better wizard fighting.

Incidentally if anyone is into pen and paper RPG games, the Mage series from World of Darkness is essentially a game playing what we all wish Harry Potter/Doctor Strange duels would be like; a really crunchy magic system set in the modern world where you can basically bend reality to your will according to your ability, with completely freeform spell designing and loads and loads of ways to fight other than just 'lazer and fireball'.&&Also see McGonagall v Snape in Deathly Hallows.&&Man I knooow. Could have been such a big reveal and badass moment. When Voldemort shows up flying after they all drink the harry poly juice potion everyone makes a huge deal about how badass it is. &&Yeah the McGonagall/Snape duel in the book had way more magic, McGonagall was manipulating a torch and transfiguring daggers and Snape was using a suit of armor.&&Mr Wayne didn't want you to think that he was deliberately wasting your time.&&I dunno, at least in MCU Ego seemed far below Dormammu. Heck, he was probably below Hela.&&NERRRRRRDDDD.

(Thanks for the correction though)&&Ah. I'm not a reader, so I just assumed he was the same as the others. Mostly because he somewhat reminded me of Knowhere.&&Yeah, I liked it when the 'prank' spells actually got used instead of just FORCE PUSH&&He was really good and subdued in Murder on the Orient Express. Hopefully he channels that for his role here.&&JK Rowling had a lot of control and input over the Harry Potter series, including, picking some of the actors. She was very involved. I have absolutely no idea about these movies, but assuming she had the same level of involvement, I assume Johhny Depp was an idea that she approved of. Perhaps for a reason. So I'll wait and see.&&I just wanna say that I think Eddie killed it as Scamander.

Only gay if I reciprocate Dumbledore, everyone knows that.""&&I just rewatched them all last week. He just tells him where the wand is and Voldemort books it after that. &&It was never about preventing Credence, it was always about causing Credence.&&Its also like people forget the entire 3rd act of the movie which was only about Cap, Bucky and Tony. That's what the movie was building up to. The airport scene was literally just a middle act fight (and a damn good one I might add). Nothing more. &&And when he *does* show up, he justifies his reputation by doing things which break narrative convention. Cedric Diggory dies an unheroic, unceremonious death, basically on a whim. Whenever he appears, he is a real bastard, and you're never left with him for long enough to acclimatise to that.&&She didn't only sign on, she wrote the entire script herself (with a little help from her friend, Steve). Whether it's good or not, this is apparently how she wanted it.&&With Harry and Draco it made sense since they are relatively raw power, just chucking it around at each other.  The equivalent of throwing haymakers.  


DvV you got the sense that they knew what the hell they were doing in comparison.&&I don’t know man, the wand bullets while wearing a regular British school uniform just kind of kills the magical element to me. &&I've spent the last 2 months re-reading the whole series. They're so amazing, no better time to start than now!&&I think people underestimate how special that was. He was 13 and we are reminded several times that many adults just can't manage the spell.

The fact that the other kids could do it in controlled conditions was also a nice sign that Harry wasn't just run-of-the-mill, he was a gifted teacher.

Also, when your life is under constant threat, your skills will be more attuned to survival than mucking about.&&Just accidentally wasting it.&&Ego was originally Ego the Living Planet, and not a Celestial. I don't think his depiction in the MCU comes anywhere close to the power of a Celestial.&&I'm still hoping that Ego will be retconned not to have been a real Celestial. After all, he became aware without memory, so how does he even know he is one? He probably just heard about those omnipotent space gods and assumed he is one, Ego-centric that he is. After all, a single Celestial can wipe out a planet without breaking a sweat.&&I liked that he was an unconventional genius who had difficulty relating to people without being a pompous dick.&&[*Twin](#spoiler)&&The ""Harry did you put yer name in da Goblet a fire!!!?"" meme is very widespread and I'm pretty sure that 90% of the Gambon dislike comes from that scene.

It's a very poignant moment when Harry tells Dumbledore that Grindelwald lied to Voldemort just to prevent Dumbledore's tomb from being desecrated.

But nope. The movie makes Grindelwald look like some evil, babbling lunatic. Very disappointing.&&That's how I remembered but haven't watched in about a month or two.

Starship Troopers is getting a 20th anniversary 4k release,28973,7g6v43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPYuV_jGk7M,2373,1511898484.0,,"Would you like to know more?&&I just rewatched this movie a year ago.  Surprisingly, this movie aged very well for being almost 20 years old.   The space ships are still pretty impressive for how old it is.&&Do you want to live forever?&&The smartest dumb movie ever made. 

Rich Eisen talks about “remote drop” movies. The kind of movie you come across on tv and you just stop and finish it no matter what. Starship Troopers is a great example of this.&&I remember having a monster crush on Denise Richards after watching this.&&It was released two months ago!&&Wonderful, now i can re-live the first time i saw boobs on the big screen in 4k. LIFE DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!&&***Need to know more intensifies***&&I can't wait to buy all the same movies I already own but in 4k. &&When this movie came out I totally missed the point. I thought it was taking itself seriously and thought it was super-cheesy. 

It all went way over my head. I think its more relevant today than ever. Good flick. &&Well let's see if this time they won't remove all the FACISM for the GERMAN version... (Starship Troopers is probably the most censored movie ever released in Germany, they even completely changed the backstory).&&Might be a dumb question but how do you make a 4k movie out of a film that wasn't filmed in 4k?&&Who's roughnecks? &&why would they not upload the trailer in 4k then?&&how did that trailer not end with ""would you like to know more?""&& Just in time for a whole new generation to miss the point!  (But seriously I bet it looks great in 4k)&&The most underrated film in history. It's unsettling how much people didn't understand it, some reviews said:

> Maybe the filmmakers are so lost in their slambang visual effects that they don't give a hoot about the movie's scariest implications.

Satire motherfucker, do you get it?

> What galls me is the film's marketing, moral and ideological cynicism.

No shit Sherlock.

Too sophisticated for its audience? Too realistic for a heavy militarized nation? What the fuck happened?&&I just saw this movie again recently, like in the past couple of years or so. What's amazing about it to me is how well it stands up. It actually looks like it was made this year, like it could be a new release. I know there are plenty of people who say that would say that the CGI is bad or whatever compared to modern movies, but really, I think it's just about perfect. The satire is spot-on, maybe even more relevant than when it first came out, the story is great, and it works really really well in light of current events.

I don't even own a 4K TV, but I can't think of a better movie to convert.&&First boobs I ever saw in a movie. &&You mean the 4K copy I've had sitting on my shelf for about 3 months now?&&So, we gonna see that scene in 4K glory, huh?   
Not sure I am ready for it.    

The scene where NPH says the braingina is afraid.&&I’m from Bruno’s Aires and I say KILL ‘EM ALL!&&Watching this trailer, I can kinda understand why people missed the message of the movie. It very much looks like your generic action sci-fi piece. They should have really made a trailer more in the vein of the propaganda reels from withing the movie. People are dumb and still would have missed it, but y'know. It woulda helped.&&This movie was everything to me at one moment in my life.&&[removed]&&I just watched this for the first time this weekend and recommend anyone who loves cinema to give it a try. 

The satire is strong with this one.  Examples:

* just-too-long cuts of soldiers shooting bugs evoking old war propaganda films
* the early internet era AOL-looking propaganda clips (""Would you like to know more"" is almost as memorable as ""I'd buy that for a dollar!"" as a creepy catchphrase)
* the seeming gender and racial equality in the context of a fascist society

There's just a ton to process and I'm going to plan to give it a rewatch in a year or two once I see ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"" again.

One thing I didn't get: Was there a reason the movie [picks on Mormons or is it just that they tend to live on the frontier and were an obvious target for a bug massacre?](#spoiler)&&Put your hand on that waaalll!&&Got to meet Dina Meyer at the last Dragoncon!

And I just bought a 4K tv so this is good news to me.absolute classic film. &&The CGI in starship troopers really holds up (except the riding the bug bits, humans still look silly). The bugs are great, I would be interested to see if it looks ok in 4K. I find it makes pixar look dodgy sometimes.

Its too uncool/cool&&Does anyone else remember when this was released on DVD in the late 90's there was supposedly a feature where you could switch viewing angles on some scenes? I remember being excited about it, but never able to figure it out.&&*DESIRE TO KNOW MORE INTENSIFIES*&&Did I just see the words 20th anniversary?


Fuuuuuuck I'm getting old.&&3 takeaways from watching this trailer:

So after working as a night stocker at Wal-Mart and being unable to make ends meet, he wound up joining the Army as a private.

He didn't brag about it, just noticed me reading the Heinlein book on my rack one Sunday and quietly told me.

Seems to be properly remastered in 4K (at least the best possible from the original 35mm film).

I first saw the movie when I was 14. Thought it was a great alien war story. 

Saw it again when I was about 25. Laughed at the absurdity and its satirical brilliance. 

Great flick. &&Same here. I'm ashamed to admit there have been a few of those types of films that I only came to appreciate as I got, if not wiser, then just less stupid.&&interesting, care to go into detail?&&Scan the film negative. 35mm film can be scanned at up to 6-8K

The VFX will still be 2K, but CG scales up pretty well.&&35mm film frames still have enough detail above the grain level to look good at 4k. What they would likely do is take one of the master 35mm prints (that they would send to get copies for the theatres made from) that will have all the special effects and edits already in, and run it through a 4k scanner. Literally, each 35mm frame gets scanned at 4096×2160 resolution... much higher than what it was scanned in at for the DVD or Blu-Ray editions. Throw in some colour correction, HDR support information... I'm sure it looks good. Although some of the miniature work can appear a bit grainy from what I've read (it might have been filmed on 35mm film, but when blown up or scaled to match the rest of the frame some of the grain becomes more apparent). Kinda like the end of Aliens... the scene on the collapsing platform where the exploding plant in the background is obviously a grainy green-screen).

So yaay for keeping one of the 35mm masters in the vault. Paramount learned this lesson with Star Trek The Next Generation. When it came time to issue the whole series box set ~~DVD~~ on Blu-ray, they had no high quality film masters to rescan... while the live action had been filmed on 35mm, all the special effects had been done in 4:3 on computer for broadcast and was never recommitted to 35mm film master. So they had to re-edit the original 35mm live action film and _redo_ all the CGI. 
&&It was basically filmed in 4k. 35mm film's resolution is so high that it's naturally in the 4k range. 

When they projected a film from a film projector at the theater in the old days, you were getting the full 4k resolution experience. But when they transferred it to VHS or DVD, the resolution was downgraded.

That's why they are re-transferring all those old movies to BluRay, where they don't have to downgrade the resolution for DVDs which could only hold small amounts of data.&&RICO'S ROUGHNECKS!!&&Fuck. Roughnecks was an amazing sequel series.

I was so pissed off when the movie was an exact opposite of the books.  

Like World War Z is a crazy crazy good book. And the movie is the exact opposite of the book and sucks donkey balls because of it. &&The movie and the book have almost nothing to do with each other. Its a satire of WW2, not the book.&&Wasn't Haldeman's Forever War written as a direct rebuttal to Henlein's Troopers?&&It's by far the most heinous (self-) censorship I've ever seen. Bear in mind that this wasn't censored because of some German Law or anything, it was simply the Publisher studio fearing the fascist themes (and satire thereof) of the movie would bomb with German audiences (or anger some German lawmakers). 

Anyway: They didn't actually *cut* anything, as in scene for scene the runtime is the same as the US release, but they completely changed parts of the story in the German dubbing:

* In the Original (US), *Service Guarantees Citizenship*. Only those who served in the military are allowed to vote. In the German version (DE), everyone is allowed to vote. 
* US: Rasczak asks Rico what the difference between a citizen and a civilian is (the difference is, Citizens have served and can vote). DE: Rasczak asks Rico what the difference between a soldier and a civilian is (according to Rico, the difference is soldiers put their life on the line for civilians, while civilians don't do that).
* US: Rasczak tells the students that only violence and force can solve things, mocking what the people of Hiroshima would say about that. DE: Rasczak tells the students about the first bug war and how it destroyed Washington (**Here the German Dub invents a first bug war so Mankind seems less aggressive**) and how the bugs were only fought back with violence.

It goes on like that throughout the whole movie. I have no idea how the publisher did not see the irony of removing all alludes to fascism in a movie specifically for Germany.

All throughout the dub the human aggression is downplayed, since they now only defend themselves after the bugs destroyed Washington, Federal Service isn't an ""Adventure"" anymore in the German dub, and people don't join the military because that's the only way to become political (one of the Girls in the shower scene tells them she only joined up since she wants to become a politician), they join because they want to protect others (Rasczak literally tells them the Federation is about protecting fellow civilians, where in the original he tells them its about smashing enemies or something violent like that).

Generally, every instance where the US version says ""Citizen"" the German dub says ""Soldier"", since there is no difference between citizens and civilians in the German dub since everyone can vote and become a politician or whatever, no matter if they served or not, unlike the original where you NEED to serve to do these things. 

Also, every instance of ""Service Guarantees Citizenship"" is ""Fight for our Future!"" in the German dub. 

Oh and also all the propaganda ""ads"" in the movie were downplayed in the german dub, none of them say anything about a ""war effort"", it's always about ""protecting our children"" or something like that.&&I would definitely like to know more&&Can't wait to buy this movie again in 8K!&&>  So they had to re-edit the original 35mm live action film and redo all the CGI. 

Jesus.&&> So they had to re-edit the original 35mm live action film and redo all the CGI.

I really don't agree with this.

The book has many indications that it is not actually advocating the things depicted.  For example, there are descriptions of humanity effectively carrying out a genocidal invasion of a weaker/more peaceful society which are not particularly flattering.

IMHO Heinlein was more subtle than you are assuming.  He was also writing in an era where it was permissible to express ideas without automatically being treated as endorsing and holding those same ideas.&&Let them shing&&But captain,  they will know where we are. &&Now they will tremble at the shound of our shilence.&&Pleash*&&Which way?&&That scene where they're abandoning ship, and the OHP is opening up with its 76mm in time with the music...

Thanks for this Info!&&Honestly the upscale from 4k to 8k is hardly detectable by the human eye. Unless you're playing it on an actual movie screen.&&It supposedly cost over $12m to restore and remaster *The Next Generation* for BD.

Edit: [now with source.](http://www.treknews.net/2017/02/02/why-ds9-voyager-not-on-blu-ray-hd/)&&My mistake, this was for the Blu-ray edition (the DVD edition used the digitized 4:3 broadcast source): 

>A news release on the official website announced on September 28, 2011, in celebration of the series' twenty-fifth anniversary, that Star Trek: The Next Generation would be completely re-mastered in 1080p and 4k high definition from the original 35 mm film negatives (consisting of almost 25,000 reels of original film stock). All the visual effects for each episode would be digitally recomposed from original large-format negatives and newly created CGI shots. &&A proper ground-up restoration of a film can be a massive undertaking. A bog-standard film to Blu Ray release is usually just taking a film print that would have been used in a projector in the cinema and scanning that to a digital file, but a full blown restoration would go through all the in-camera film negatives, scan them, and basically re-edit the entire film shot-for-shot in a digital workflow. And then that's not even considering films with CGI in them. You'd basically have to either go back to the original digital files (if you didn't delete them and your computer can read them) and re-render them at a higher resolution, or you'd have to re-create all the CGI images from scratch to look exactly like the original ones. 

There's a reason some special releases of old movies cost so much to buy on Blu Ray, but it gives such amazing results when people who care about art restore it properly. &&> when bugs are the other

That's one of the problematic roots of fascism. In a perfect fascist world, one where there is no ""other,"" fascism can't function. *Someone* would become the new ""other.""

Disclaimer: Just because fascism is stupid doesn't mean communism is any less stupid. They're both interesting political philosophies, neither of which would ever work in practice in their pure forms.

It's packed to the brim with fatuous lectures that masquerade as political philosophy.  He uses a fictional future to depict the end-result of his superior ideas, so it's a particular kind of propaganda, like John Galt's imagined successful strike.

But the book doesn't strike me as fascist.  In the novel, everyone on earth can serve and obtain their ability to vote.&&I never understood that. It's a democracy but only veterans can vote. Service is voluntary and everyone is eligible. Is that really much different from countries (e.g. Germany, South Korea, Israel) with compulsory military service? In those countries you don't even get a choice.&&Have you read the book or any Heinlein? &&Hey look! Someone who never read the book. Just like the makers of the movie. &&You have no idea what your talking about it you think that. &&The society certainly had fascistic attributes from an academic sense.  But very little of the contextual.  The idea of 20th century fascism was a state that existed for its own purpose, in which its citizens were generally a faceless mass, welded tight by nationalism into an unbreakable bundle of sticks. 

A key part of this included that the state's need were superior to the individual's freedom.  A political analogue of communism, where the individual is secondary to the 'need' of the group.  And this was generally run by a dictatorial oligarchy, and/or a cult of personality based around a figurehead.

The society in Star Ship Troopers differs in many of these regards.  Individual rights of civilians are strongly protected.  As the biggest example; despite being faced with a physically superior and implacable enemy, there is no draft, nor an utter mobilization of the economy to direct everything towards the war effort.

Political power, similarly, is not held by a selective oligarchy, but rather an utterly self-selecting subset of the entire population, whose ability to gain citizenship is facilitated in every way.  This subset is those who choose military service, or barring military service - engage in work with a similar degree of risk to life and limb.  Citizenship and political franchise are not easily gotten just by signing up, but the only thing that keeps people out is their own valuation of their life vs their desire for political franchise.  Nothing else prevents them from citizenship.

This system *does* create a state that perpetuates itself, as both violent and civil revolution are severely reduced in possibility.  But the mechanism that suppresses insurrection, paradoxically, is rigorously making freedom an attainable state for every single member of the populace.

Patriotism stemming from a positive evaluation of an objectively high-functioning, stable, prosperous society can be held without it being 'fascism'.  For the world Heinlein constructed in its entirety, it is too simplistic to dismiss it as fascism.

Also, as mentioned elsewhere in the comments, this was simply one exploration of one possible society by Heinlein.  Not an endorsement for it specifically.  He did a lot of these thought experiments with different political systems.  The basis behind Star Ship Troopers one was the idea of *balancing authority with responsibility* as a necessity for a stable and enduring government/nation.  With that in mind, how might one create a fair democracy that still balances the two effectively?&&The director admitted to not even reading the book, so. Also if you consider the book to be unabashed fascist propaganda, I'm guessing you didn't read it either.

So, SST is about a society led by veterans, Farnhams Freehold is Anarchism, Friday is technocrats, Future History/Fifth Column/a few others theocracies, Moon is A Harsh Mistress is Libertarianism and Glory Road is an Empire. Since you can't be for all of those, obviously you can't take whatever values are espoused in his book as his own.

I don't know that this is entirely true either. During this period of time in American history, anything that wasn't explicitly anti-Communist was treated with great distrust. It was a [very scary time to be a writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist). Additionally, my interpretation of his novel *Starship Troopers* aligns pretty well with his [political views at the time he wrote it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein#Politics).

However, without spoiling too much I can certainly say the message is definitively anti-war.&&Yeah it's really surreal at times. Like the propaganda ad where you see soldiers give ammunition to little children, the original says something like ""Everyone needs to help our war effort"", while the German dub says ""We need to protect our children"".

So, we protect children by giving them live ammunition? The original is a (maybe flawed) satire of facism and at times very reminiscent of Nazi Propaganda (hell the ""psykers"" Doogie Howser joins are clearly modeled after the SS uniforms), while the German dub makes into into this self-serious military good-guys movie - probably the exact opposite of what Paul Verhoeven (a Dutch born before WWII) and the publisher intended (even with the censorship).

[The US original tried to be the exact opposite of Heinlein's original novel](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/paul-verhoeven-slams-starship-troopers-remake-fascist-update-perfect-trump-presidency-1201747155/):

> “It said in the article [that] the production team of that movie of the remake, that they would go back more and more towards the novel. And of course, we really, really tried to get away from the novel, because we felt that the novel was fascistic and militaristic,” said Verhoeven.  “You feel that going back to the novel would fit very much in a Trump Presidency.”

Weirdly enough the German dub actually made it closer to the original, pretty fascist novel, by rendering the military as nothing less than humanity's bright defenders who choose to lay down their lives for their fellow citizens who aren't as brave to do so.&&Un-Fun Fact:  ~95% of movies shown in theaters are the same resolution as a standard Blu-ray.

But it seems like different teams were working on different elements in the same frame.  So some stuff would look great, like the environment and background, while other things, especially the characters and vehicles in the action scenes looked out of place.

You have to keep in mind Heinlein’s views when reading it though. &&Correct. There are other ways to gain citizenship besides serving in the military.

However, an important point that often gets overlooked when discussing the movie is that Rico's parents *aren't citizens*, and advocate against Rico trying to become one. They don't think it's important. ""It"" being, you know, *the right to vote*.&&There's a brief scene where one of the female recruits mentions she joined up to get a license to birth.

Tucking the right to give birth behind military service seems closer on the spectrum to fascism to me&&In the book you can become a citizen through different types of federal service like being a mail man. 

It’s been a while, someone correct me if I’m wrong. 

Edit: Also if you suck and can’t pass the tests to make it into any job in the military (even MI) you can still join, they just give you an even shittier job. You’re basically a non rate, and I think in the book they used the example of having to test out survival gear for extended periods of time on planets with crappy atmospheres, a job so bad that you’re less likely to die in the MI. &&Military service is not required, it's just some form of civil service.

I was blown away by how much CGI was used in ""Zodiac"" but only after watching a making-of for it. Most David Fincher movies are actually loaded with CGI but since he's a maniac of perfection, uses top notch people and shows more down-to-earth things in CGI (no spaceships and such) it's much harder to notice it.

We have the technology but the director must push for it to be used seamlessly and he needs to have the production time and money.

Now it's another question *if* we actually want seamless CGI in superhero movies. I guess they know audience will tolerate it better than say for a serious thriller but I suspect it's mostly because they know they can get away with it and save a buck.&&It's thick and creamy and it gets everywhere&&They’ve gone to plaid.&&Nobody gives me the raspberry!&&Oh I wasn’t talking about anything other than the visuals themselves.

At least according to my skimming of wikipedia. So we both get to be right, and everyone's happy! Well, except the laborers.&&I think the in-world explanation is the requirement is more about a person's willingness to sacrifice for the public good than their ability.  Sure, the military would find something for an invalid to do if they managed to get in, but it would not be a role that would harm its mission nor detract from the demands expected of a serviceman in the book.&&That's only in the movie, as far as I can recall. I've read the book through about 5 times, and I don't recall military service being a requirement to have a child.&&The Nazis were actually very obsessed about German women having as many children as possible. They even gave them medals for having a certain number of children. &&Well, in a distant future as this with a unified earth government and overpopulation a serious problem (though I don't think it's specifically stated, just implied), I can see licenses to have children justifiable. That's one reason why groups like Mormons left Earth to settle new colonies and avoid such licenses. &&>In the book you can become a citizen through different types of federal service like being a mail man.

That's right, but I think the catch was more demanding forms of service required shorter terms.  So, a military career tended to be popular because it was a quick way to attain the status of a full citizen.&&Yup there is a almost throw away line in the book, something about if you were deaf, blind, and had no limbs but found away to communicate you wanted to vote they’d find a door somewhere for you to hold open. &&Heinlein doesn't go into much detail about the non-military service roles, but yeah it's implied that there are civilian alternatives to the military. You don't get to choose though (Rico specifically wanted to avoid MI; you only get to select your preferences and are judged based on an aptitude test) and I think regardless of whether it's military or not, all of the service terms involve some kind of undesirable menial labour. Officer placements are for those who want to ""go career"" and make it a lifetime commitment.&&You're 100% correct, at least as far as the book is concerned. They explicitly *have* to take every volunteer, even if they're wheelchair-bound or otherwise incapacitated, and provide them with a federal service to perform for the allotted time. &&Yeah Johnny’s dad was effectively a millionaire off of just selling food to the military.

Nazis made the company, It fell due to WW2 destroying it, The Brits took it over, Major Ivan Hirst said ""yo homie wouldn't it be sweet if this factory made civilian cars now?"" so The Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ran the factory until 1949 before it was slowly released to the no longer Nazi Germany. &&Yeah... that time period was a weird time period for a lot of companies.  If you run a company that manufactures consumer goods, and if the country your company is based in enters a large scale war, you're pretty much stuck supporting them as it becomes a national security issue.

The sucky thing is that since they were on the losing side they have to figure out a way to spin it.  It's easy enough for a company like GM to say the helped defeat the Nazi's by manufacturing tanks instead of cars.

There really hasn't been any large scale conflicts involving developed nations since then so honestly my whole frame of reference is based off of movies and documentaries.  The biggest conflict in my lifetime's been the ""War on Terror"", with the primary sacrifice being giving up freedoms and being bombarded with pro-soldier propaganda.  We haven't had to manufacture pennies out of steel because we needed the copper for bullets, and we haven't had to have women take up all the factory jobs because all the men got drafted into the military.&&Not just the military.

My point is that there was no real barrier to democracy by class, position, wealth, etc.  Anyone could take actions and obtain a vote, so it was not obviously a fascist society.&&Yep that sounds right. 

In the example I used earlier, I believe there is even a difference in length of service within military MOS. 

MI being the shortest with the only one being shorter is not having a specialty, which is likely to get you killed faster.

I fear this might be the end of Mad Max. I hope not. I desperately hope not. I grew up on Toecutter and the like.&&This happens WAY MORE than people think.  Production companies are notorious for moving funds and using creative accounting to make it seem like a movie hasn't made any money at all...or has gone over budget. &&Welp... there goes any chance of potentially future Mad Max films... thanks a lot, WB...&&Pay that man his money 

'*John Malkovich Rounders Voice*'&&Holy shit, what is $7 million to these guys if it makes them both more Max films and probably billions in potential revenue? Just pay his friggin bonus.&&Throwaway for obvious reasons - I'm a former Production Accountant for Warner Bros. and I know how these deals work, how they're structured and can probably pinpoint where it went wrong.  Of course, I won't divulge company secrets and will only share in generalities:

**How the deals are built**

WB utilizes the agreed upon contracts between the studio and talent.  Most production companies belong to certain directors and actors (eg - Syncopy = Christopher Nolan, etc) so whenever you watch a movie and see all those logos - it's usually tied to an actor or someone on the production team.  The shortform/summary versions of these contracts are used to build out how the statements are structured.  I'll go into some more detail below.  But know that the share %, rates, etc are all dictated off the contracts themselves.

**How it's structured**

The basic outline of movie statements goes something like this:

* Gross Profits from all categories worldwide (Theatrical, Non-Theat, Over-the-Top, Home Video, etc)

* Less Total expenses (Production cost, incurred interest, etc)

* The Net sum of the above will usually then be calculated against a share percentage.  So let's say the net sum is $100.  If Tom Cruise agreed to get paid 10% of all net profits, he would get $10.

**Types of Statements**

In general, there are only two types of statements for hollywood talent.  Now each of these two have offshoots with various little differences in terms of how the numbers are calculated.  Those two types are GROSS and NET statements.

Gross statements are essentially structured so that the talent receives as much as possible above the line in profit.  These types usually go to A-list talent for obvious reasons.  Net statements are usually charged below the line so these folks get a lower share due to the accounting of all production expenses.  Gross statements don't usually account for all production costs.

**Where it gets tricky**

Some studios employ something called ""breakevens"" and these are categoried into two types - CSPM and CSPI.  These two types determine where a statement with ""break"" before it begins paying out to talent.  These are by far the most complex types and is really where all your suspicions about tricky hollywood accounting comes into play.  We used to joke that some little man in a green hat in a back room invented all these formulas in order to make sure the studios maximized their profits.

CSPM relates to a breakpoint that constantly moves.  So once a film breaks even with it's revenue + expenses, it begins to pay its X share dollar amount to the talent.  But guess what...  the breakpoint is always moving - one would think it breakevens once and you just pay out in perpetuity, right?  WRONG!  Because the breakpoints are positioned to constantly ""break"" every pay period... one can imagine the talent is either not making much at all or is being ripped off in some way...  

CSPI on the other hand is a type of breakeven that has an Initial position where it breaks and then becomes a gross statement (see above)

Overall, there is a lot more but I just wanted to provide a quick rundown of how it works.  AMA if you have any questions.

Forgot to mention - I suspect miller received a complicated offer on his statement/contract (I haven't seen it) - Usually it's either incompetence on the analyst who prepared the statement, overlook by lazy managers or the statement was set up incorrectly.  If you ever saw one of these statements, you would be so angry as to how many ways to sunday they find a way to charge an expense, interest rate, etc. against you.  &&""Hollywood Math"" strikes again.&&Those fucking snakes need to pay the man.  Fuck WB.&&Fuck!! This is gonna delay production of the second one. The guy made a phenomenal movie. Pay him whatever he wants and get back to work.&&George Miller should also be calling sexual assault Because Warner Bros sure fucked him.&&I was scared when I saw George Miller on the headline. Thank god it wasn’t another scandal&&Does George Miller own the rights, because I would gladly crowdfund another Mad Max.&&Welp, there goes that chance of a Fury Road sequel to happen.

At least in George Miller's lifetime that is.&&>He famously overcame more than a decade of setbacks to make the fourth movie in the action series, including three major delays, three actors down to play Max - Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger then Tom Hardy - then having to switch the gruelling shoot from Australia to Namibia.

Ledger as Mad Max. Holy fuck.&&Ah, yes, the ol' *""it was a net loss""* after they finished factoring in their executive salaries into the budget.&&> Justice David Hammerschlag said the agreement to make Fury Road included a condition that Kennedy Miller Mitchell would receive a $US7 million bonus if ""the final net cost"" of the movie was not more than $US157 million, after certain costs were excluded from calculations.

There will never be a final net cost, Warner Brothers will make sure of that.&&Wonderful!

Miller isn’t getting any younger. He hadn’t done a live action movie in a little under 20 years before Fury Road came out, let alone, a big budget action movie. Beyond Thunderdome (1985) was made 30 years before and even though he was out of practice, he came back with one of, if not the best, action movies of the new millennium.

So, while the studio dicks around and drags its feet over paying a guy who directed a phenomenal movie, winning 6/10 at the Oscars*. We have to wait while art loses another battle against greed in Hollywood. Yes, that happens all of the time (9/10 times In Hollywood) but this particular time it seems especially callus and greedy. 

The main problem is, the second and third installments get pushed farther and farther back. Tom Hardy’s  schedule is not going to miraculously free up anytime soon.... I get frustrated with this shit. I hope all the parties involved can gather up ALL their shit, so it’s all together like, because I don’t want Miller to die before he has an opportunity to finish the seri3s. 

* it needs to be noted how rare it is for a hardcore balls-to-the-wall action movie to get the recognition Fury Road did at the Academy Awards.&&Hollywood Accounting needs to die.

There is no middle ground or compromise. It's fraud against artists and governments alike. They don't give a shit and they've grown used to getting away with things. &&Pay the man. It's an amazing film.&&Turns out he was sexually assaulted by the studio. &&I'm so triggered by the Weinstein Effect, that I balked when I saw Mr Miller's name, fearing the worst.

The producer behind something as pure as ""Babe."" Mr Miller is on my ""please don't be a perv"" list.&&Title should read: “Warner Bros won’t stop fucking people”&&I find it extremely satisfying that Warner Bros vehemently wanted this to be fought in the US and got denied. Australia for the win&&They fucked him on the financing deal too. Had they followed the contract and offered Miller's production company first right of refusal for financing 12% of the film like they did with Ratner's company Miller would have made a lot more money with a 12% ownership stake in the film. So they fucked him out of that profit and they weaseled out of the 7 Million bonus. And stupidly soured what could have been a very profitable relationship for years to come over a relatively (in comparison to what they spend on one big budget film) small amount of money. 

Poor business decisions abound. &&***Immortan George demands his spoils!***&&In the article it says WB is not paying because Fury Road went over the budget, and thus the bonus will not be granted. 

I don't know who to side with. Obviously I want Miller and his production company to be rewarded, but this might be one of those cases where varying interpretations of the fine print is what is causing the problems. &&[deleted]&&> The directors of the production company are Miller, whose stellar directing career includes two Happy Feet movies and the Mad Max series, and his longtime producing partner Doug Mitchell.

Does anyone else find this as hilarious as I do?&&What? WB being skimpy with payouts for a highly successful franchise? This is completely new!&&At this point, someone should sue the studios over their accounting practices as it's clearly capable of repetition even if they settle after suit is filed. Get a permanent injunction against the studios to keep them from using these deceptive practices. That way you can not only nail them I'd they screw over someone else, they're on the hook for violating the injunction as well. &&If this jeopardizes the ability for Miller to make another Mad Max film, I'm gonna kill a motherfucker. &&Spend twenty years making the best movie of the 21st century and your reward is you get to sell your home and sue your boss

I saw his face in the thumbnail and got scared this was a #metoo naming. But yeah, pay the man! &&Ill still count it as being raped by hollywood elites. Add it to the pile. &&Shit, as long as he didn't rape someone, I say pay him whatever he wants. We're gonna need directors next year, man.&&One of the first things we were taught in film school is that the big studios continuously and consistently fuck everyone.

One of the few movies I've bought and I want more. Superb film.&&WB being a bitch. Pay your fucking directors assholes. They're making you shitloads of money.&&Dammit, pay the man! I need enough Mad Max sequels to justify using Mel Gibson in one of them! &&It's ridiculous that they would put such an amazing cash cow at risk by stiffing him for money he's clearly earned.&& This is the same company that claimed Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"" lost money, right?&&It'll get lost in the mountain of posts but miller has screwed heaps of people out of the money they deserved.

So many composers should have been paid for his use of their compositions but he would get another composer to make small variations to the piece so he could worm his way out of just paying them what they're owed.&&Not that there's any danger of this ever happening but if I were ever to make a movie I'd go and do it in India just to avoid the notorious Hollywood accounting.

EDIT: Just read the article, considering the deal they signed, this kind of dispute was almost inevitable when you're talking about big companies who can afford to hire teams of lawyers to fight for every last dollar. The lesson here is don't add weird contingency bonuses to your contracts, and hire better lawyers who can write air-tight contracts and can spot & avoid these pitfalls.&&In the article it says the studio agreed to a bonus if it came in under-budget. It did not. Miller is saying the studio made a bunch of demands that caused them to go over-budget. 

I can totally see the studio trying to fuck up a perfectly good director's vision. Now I'm really curious about those studio 'extras' that forced them over-budget.

-Anonymous Hollywood Accountant&&And like always any kind of money dispute gets the same cheeky comment... and like always it is actually wrong. 

This is a rather novel dispute actually:

>Justice David Hammerschlag said the agreement to make Fury Road included a condition that Kennedy Miller Mitchell would receive a $US7 million bonus if ""the final net cost"" of the movie was not more than $US157 million, after certain costs were excluded from calculations.

Unlike ""Hollywood accounting"" this has nothing to do with the actual return and therefore is **not** about making the actual profit disappear (on paper via shell corporations) to claim the movie lost money. 

Because of course this is *only* about the budget of the movie itself ergo essentially before it hits theaters and not affected by actually making or losing money. Not that Warner necessarily didn't try to invent some costs to save some money but this is an entirely different sort of shenanigans, assuming there in fact are shenanigans. (And going into Australian court makes this a very different legal ballgame)

More original stories from that world through Max's eyes would be fantastic.&&I agree with this. Fury Road was an amazing film and was a great ending to the series, as unintentional as that might be. It showed progress and hope without getting mushy and allowed for the audience to make their own ideas to how and what will happen next for the characters. I don’t know, maybe i’m cynical but there’s a lot of movies that don’t need sequels or prequels, Fury Road (despite being a sequel itself) is one of them. &&I actually think we need a Furiosa origin story because how in the hell did a character born in Australia get an American accent?&&I don't get why people hate prequels so much.

&&> Unlike ""Hollywood accounting"" this has nothing to do with the actual return and therefore is not about making the actual profit disappear (on paper via shell corporations) to claim the movie lost money.

No, because his bonus was based on budget, not profit, so it's about making the *budget* disappear to claim the bonus is unearned. &&They're claiming the studio introduced delays and extra expenses into the budget that caused it to go over budget, and that without the studio's interference, they would be owed the 7 million.

And that's not the bigger issue.  The 7 million is chump change compared to the other half of the suit.  

Miller's production company had right of first refusal for any extra extra financing offer the studio wanted to pursue, and they're claiming that the studio's use of Ratner's firm for 12.5 percent of the budget violated that agreement - meaning the studio would owe Miller's production company whatever profits they paid to Ratner's firm.  That's a LOT of money.&&Thank God, Worthington is a Muppet. &&This is Reddit, and therefore none of the commenters have bothered to read the article.&&I'll have to watch it. &&[removed]&&I mean, they weren't up to the standard of Lord of the Rings, but I still enjoyed the extra time in Middle Earth&&Hobbit trilogy wasn't that bad but you can say weak compared to Lord of the rings trilogy&&[deleted]&&The first was good though. &&>the previous director quit/was fired

IIRC Guillermo del Toro quit after the project stalled out. At the time he had already sunk a couple of years into pre-production, but the studios kept spinning their wheels in negotiations. &&That was legitimately depressing to read. The LOTR movies are legitimate classics, I feel embarrased that I ever thought that the issue was with Peter Jackson when it was really the circumstances he worked under. I hope the Hobbit series didn't burn him out from directing for good. He deserves to be able to produce work that he's proud of.&&Which is why I wish people would stop giving Jackson shit over the films. He was given a dumpster fire of a shoot to rush through. LOTR took YEARS to plan out, let alone produce. He had none of that luxury, and save for the Tauriel and Legolas subplots, I thought it was a decent enough adaptation, all things considered.&&> 
> Part of the reason the movies were super weirdly paced etc. is because of this - Jackson would literally have to schedule the afternoon shoots in his lunch break because he came on so late.

Probably didn't help that they announced that the planned two movies would become three, less than five months before the premiere of the first one, after principal photography had wrapped. I remember hearing that and thinking ""Well, good luck rewriting two scripts into three movies with their own beginnings, middles and ends, after you've already shot most of it""&&Benicio?&&It makes me wonder if people even bothered to read the article.

He had a bonus clause in his contract for an additional 7million dollars if the movie cost came in under 157million dollars.

The Studio says the movie went over this amount, therefore he isn't owed the bonus pay. Production company says it's not their fault for the extra cost, therefore it shouldn't be included in the cost calculation, and without those extra expenses, the total cost came under the amount, therefore he's owed a bonus.

--

This is a far cry from your usual hollywood accounting story, or how you should negotiate on gross vs net earnings... like... what does that have to do with anything?

The entire dispute is over how much the movie cost to be made, and whether or not the extra costs should be taken into account for the bonus payout or not.

edit:

For those constantly saying ""That *IS* Hollywood Accounting, the studio is making up costs to justify not paying the man!"" -- All I can say is, read the article. The production company isn't contesting that this ""extra"" amount that put them over the bonus clause exists, they are contesting that it shouldn't be factored into it, because they contend it wasn't their fault for it being necessary.

In a really shitty oversimplified way it's like we agree on setting up shop and you tell me if I can setup for less than 5k you'll give me a 1k bonus, but then you come over one day and break the front window and it costs 700 to replace it and it puts my total at 5300... and I say... that's not fair, it's not my fault we had an extra 700, and you say ""But it still happened, so... no bonus""

--

I wouldn't be disputing that the 700 exists and is a real expense, I'm saying it's bs to hold it against me.&&This isn't about hollywood accounting, this is actually about george delivering a movie under a certain dollar amount, he contends that the studio demanded changes that made him go over that dollar amount therefore he still deserves the bonus. This isn't about percentage points&&Sounds like the people signing deals have terrible contract lawyers. There are numerous examples of actors making a small fortune in backend deals.

&&150m budget was heavily inflated due to continuously delayed production and many technical issues while filming. Movie probably cost around $90-100 million originally. Plus reportedly Warner didn't spend that much on marketing - I think like $30 million or something close to that.

I'm not saying its a huge profit. It broke even and made a profit, but not by much. It was an average box office hit but a sequel is very likely due to the awards and acclaim it received.

It's inconsequential to The Hobbit, but it's pretty important to the expansive lore of Middle Earth. If you watch through both trilogies it gels way better when you see Sauron is gaining power/influence rather than just randomly popping up out of nowhere as some epic force that is inexplicably totally absent from one of the largest battles in a long time featuring their leader's most prized possession/lifeforce.

these ppl are fucking sociopaths when it comes to money. also when it comes to sex as it turns out. 

&&I did read the article. It sounds like those extra costs were made necessary by Warner Brothers themselves. They made mistakes that costed the movie money. That's why the Miller production company doesn't want to include it. It not only isn't their fault, it's WB's fault and they're the ones who are supposed to be paying. They also violated another clause in the contract that the Miller company would have first crack at any further financing. So it actually sounds like Warner Brothers are just being dickheads. &&but then his salary is 7 million higher and the cost is over 157 so he does not get his bonus but then his salary is 7 million lower and the cost is under 157 and he does get his bonus but then his salary is 7 million higher and the cost is over 157 so he does not get his bonus but then his salary is 7 million lower and the cost is under 157 and he does get his bonus ....&&> This is a far cry from your usual hollywood accounting story

No, actually,  it's the same old story. The accounting rules that studios use add external costs into movies to make them, on paper, non-profitable, even when they rake in millions. For example, the director may have spent less than 157 million, but the studio probably then included the marketing budget for the film, even though they probably own the marketing firm that they ""hired"" to do the work.
&&> The Studio says the movie went over this amount, therefore he isn't owed the bonus pay. Production company says it's not their fault for the extra cost, therefore it shouldn't be included in the cost calculation, and without those extra expenses, the total cost came under the amount, therefore he's owed a bonus.

So...hollywood accounting.&&I did read the entire article. And I still came away thinking ""typical Hollywood accounting bullshit."" In other words, as usual, they don't want to pay people what they are clearly owed.&&You didn't read it. They violated a clause by seeking investors before giving miller right to first refusal as well.&&> This is a far cry from your usual hollywood accounting story,

Uh sounds exactly like HW accounting to me.  The studio ""decided"" to do things that were not agreed upon beforehand without consulting, and broke the agreement of Miller's right first of refusal for additional financing.

Studio exec: Hey it looks like they are going to come in under budget, we better gin up some extra bills to make it go over so we don't have to pay that bonus.  

> they are contesting that it shouldn't be factored into it, because they contend it wasn't their fault for it being necessary.

No they contend that the studio spent the money without consulting Miller first, so Miller didn't know about it, and had no say, and couldn't therefore make sure his spending took their spending into account.&&> This is a far cry from your usual hollywood accounting story, or how you should negotiate on gross vs net earnings... like... what does that have to do with anything?

 As great as she is all Furiosa is in the movie is her goals and her title; the imperitor who saves the girls to go home.

In the same way that Nolan's Batman has no resemblance to Schumacher's Batman, it's likely that Jackson had to throw away most of what he worked on with del Toro because it simply wouldn't work in his version of The Hobbit.

That's not what the clause is about. It's about how much it *cost.* The production team spent under that amount so the bonus is earned. Warner Bros is saying, ""No we tacked on bullshit extra costs on top of what your production team spent and brought the cost above that. No bonus for you.""

Miller is suing because presumably under his contract the additional expenses they're adding are bullshit and not countable by the wording of the contract. Alternatively, the contract wasn't air-tight enough and Warner Bros is just exploiting a loophole to withhold 7 million dollars from Miller.

I'd be surprised if someone who has been around as long as Miller has, didn't have some more specific terms about that bonus in their contract. I'd *guess* that Miller is most likely suing because his contract specifies what counts towards the bonus, but Warner Bros is claiming bullshit anyway, meaning I wouldn't be surprised if this is just a big fuck up by Warner Bros and a pretty straight forward case for Miller to win.&&Except directors and their agents aren't new to Hollywood accounting, so they define down ""costs"" to mean production costs, not IP costs and marketing.

All praise Jackson for coming into the project late and basically working 20 hours every day for months to get the movie done before the deadline. 

Also WB's decision to make it 3 movies instead of the original 2 made it harder to make the movies good.

For all they knew, they were spending 157 million on an unprofitable bust, that's the whole point.&&You're confusing revenue with profit.  Very few movies earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profit, and Fury Road was not one of them.

Fury Road cost about $200 million to produce, distribute and advertise.  It took in around $370 million in theaters.  Of that $370 million, Warner only got 50-60% of the ticket revenue.  So it's unlikely they made a profit on the film at all during it's theatrical run. 

It has since made close to $60 million in post theater distribution (DVD/Blu-Ray/TV), so they're probably seeing profit now, but $7 million would represent a significant chunk of that profit.

When the bonus has nothing to do with how much the film made. 

Since it's pretty common for people on reddit to not read the article posted and just jump to the comments (not saying you did, but maybe others):

>Justice David Hammerschlag said the agreement to make Fury Road included a condition that Kennedy Miller Mitchell would receive a $US7 million bonus if ""the final net cost"" of the movie was not more than $US157 million, **after certain costs were excluded from calculations.**&&To a lay person like you, any accounting looks fancy.&&I think it's a partnership between BBCA and Netflix. And that BBCA has rights to first broadcast. But... I may be wrong there.
&&Not reading comment if it discusses anything Season 2 related thanks.&&I think somebody at WB just didn't really take Fury Road seriously, for whatever reason. It's marketing campaign wasn't big enough for such a great big-budget action movie. People are also saying that it may have been a long-shot for China release, due to it's violence, sexuality, and depiction of anarchy. China only allows a small number of foreign movies to release in China, to protect the local film industry, so they're very choosy.

Yes. &&Assuming the story is true, they probably have different hands in different projects. In which case, people in some of those projects may be owed money by people in other projects. Disney as a whole might make money back from it, but if the argument is between ""animation"" vs. some other production aspect, it makes sense that they would argue about it.

> the studio can claim the film **costs** whatever the fuck they want

Note the word 'made' changed to 'cost'.

It's all about making it look like they spent all the money in some facet of bringing the movie into existence and its distribution.

The studio claims they had costs, and this arrangement is not surprisingly once again beneficial to them. The main point: they magically hardly ever make above their costs, which in turn turns the spigot off for their downstream obligations.&&Multi-million dollar accounting? Absofuckinglutely.

The movie looks terrible.  &&muh Magnum Opus.&&[deleted]&&Also think of it this way. If you hired a builder to build a house on a $157,000 budget with a clause that stated if the build is completed under that figure, the builder receives a $7,000 bonus. During the build, the owner causes a $5,000 mistake but the builder works with it, completing the job but at a final build cost of $159,000. 

He has all the right to demand that bonus but the question is, did you need that builder for future works?

The Incredibles is one of the superhero movies where the powers are shown to work together rather than independently,26666,7c8ax4,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7c8ax4/the_incredibles_is_one_of_the_superhero_movies/,1539,1510405783.0,"Most superhero movies featuring multiple heroes tend to have each one fighting individually.

The Incredibles manages to take the characters powers and blend them together during the story.

Helen transforms into a boat and Dash uses his speed as a motor.

Violet creates a shield ball, and Dash uses his speed to hamster away.

Bob throws Syndromes remote really far, because he knows he needs to get Dash away from the robot, and that Dash will be able to use his speed to catch the remote.

Bob uses his strength to throw Helen, who is able to then use her powers to save their baby.

Frozone freezes the road the robot is walking on to make it slip, Helen turns herself into a tripwire to make it fall.

It makes the fighting seem so much more cohesive when every character is using their powers with other powers to complete a task. 

I hope the Incredibles 2 shows more of this cohesion. 

Edit: There seems to be a lot of comments saying that team cohesion happens in every movie like X-men where they go to destroy the machine, or Fantastic 4 when they seal Dr.Doom inside a flame ball. Maybe I should have said that the Incredibles has this idea of combining powers consistently throughout the movie, and not only in a climax fight scene to win.","Take notes future Fantastic Four directors, take very diligent notes. &&The trailer for the sequel just got rated, which means it's more than likely going to come out next week or the week after with Coco!&&The characters in Kung Fu Panda also use each other’s capabilities seamlessly- crane flies them up, snake flings them like a slingshot, etc&&I did like how the first Avengers movie had them work together in the final battle. Iron Man shoots Caps shield to get different enemies, Hulk smashes the shield into the Leviathan to bring it down*, etc.

That said, I think Incredibles did it the absolute best. 

*Edit: It was Thor and Hulk that brought down the Leviathan actually, my mistake. &&Also the first movie where capes were denigrated as an unnecessary flourish in superhero crime fighting.

The Incredibles is a great movie. One of Pixar’s masterpieces.

It's a web serial, so it was written and posted chapter by chapter.  The author just started the sequel, posted the first chapter today! It's literally my favorite thing I've ever read, above ASOIAF.  It can also be extremely dark. There are some chapters that put GRRM to shame, and some sections could be classified as horror, for sure.

The main character is a girl named Taylor. It starts off a little awkward, she's a high school girl getting bullied. But she ""triggered"", got powers, and joins the world of Capes.  Her power is ""arthropodvoyance"" and ""arthropodkinesis"" - She controls all the bugs around her. Through sheer clever use of powers and using powers synergistically, she ends up proving herself to be one of the most bad ass characters in a story full of bad ass characters and non stop escalating super powered bad assery. 

/r/parahumans&&TIL Dash is a total MVP and his team is great at setting up his plays&&Wasn't it a family learning to work together?&&How is this rare?

Good post, though. I never really paid attention to that in The Incredibles, and it makes me want to watch it again. &&I thought the avengers did an amazing sequence where the heroes worked togetther. Hulk putting a piece of metal down and Thor hammering it in, Clint calling shots, captain boosting widow up with his shield&&The Avengers movies dabble in this. Tony using Cap's shield as a reflector for his laser, Thor creating a shockwave by slamming Mjolnir on the shield, Thor electrifying the metal panel the Hulk stabbed the Chitauri worm with.&&Literally all superhero films do this dude. Any film with multiple superheroes has scenes they use their powers in unison. It's a tried and true trope. Which did not start with the Incredibles. Which is a amazing film by the way. But I'm not going to start making stuff up to explain why that is, I think it's actual merits are strong enough to be able to be honest about it. &&It's still the best superhero movie ever. &&Ummm, the fastball special??  Don't discount the classic X-men books&&The thing about this, is that simply due to the nature of animated vs. live action movies, it is a lot easier to make this work in animation. Some of these scenes, such as when Helen turns herself into a boat, would look and be very silly if viewed in live action. I'm not saying cohesion of powers like these examples doesn't work at all in live action, I just think it's much easier to make work in animation simply due to the fact that it doesn't look as funny in animation. 

That being said, I do hope we see more of this in Incredibles 2, and I hope we also see more of this in live action as well. &&I still say the Incredibles is the best fantastic four movie ever made&&Don't they use all of their powers together at the end of the second fantastic four movie?&&Take notes?!

I am sure people underestimate the entertainment value of these movies because they’re “children’s cartoons “ and “not made by Pixar” but I have to tell you that Dreamworks really imvested a lot into these.  They hired some of the best artists on earth to design the look of the movie, flew key staff to tour China, hired kung fu masters to work with animators, and took the time to set up a production schedule that wasn’t rushed (nearly 4yrs if you count 2yrs of pre-production). 

I love a lot of what came out of Dreamworks between 2005-2012. The Croods, How to Train your Dragon, Shrek... these had a lot of heart in them.  A lot of people like to kick non Pixar feature animation around as substandard but I feel these were beautifully executed.  

EDIT:  I still recall seeing the “Tai Lung prison escape” sequence from the first KFP - still without audio or even final lighting - and was so blown away by how much ass kickery it packed.

It's strong points are a huge cast of incredibly well developed characters and powers, it's dark/gritty take on superpowers in general and the extent to which they can be abused, and absolutely fantastic world building. Characters don't get stronger or more powerful, they get more clever with the use of their powers. 

It starts off kind of slow for some people, but once it finds its stride, it's really hard to put down. It also can cause a little bit of fatigue at some points because of how long it is and because the stakes escalate at crazy paces sometimes.

I definitely recommend it. &&It's a story about people who got superpowers on the worst days of their lives.

It's a wonderful piece of literature that tackles themes of trauma and authority on every scale, from the personal to the global.

It's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that intelligently justifies and explores the implications of many tropes in the genre.

It's an amazing superhero action novel with incredibly inventive powers used intelligently, with gripping and suspenseful fight scenes.

It's a piece of really interesting science fiction that explores the setting and culture that follows from the introduction of superpowers throughout the entire world.

It's the story of a girl named Taylor and the choices she makes, and how her experiences, traumas, and flaws inform those choices.

It's an addicting piece of fiction that will draw you in, get you incredibly invested, and keep you reading, chapter after chapter.

It's a story about a girl who controls bugs, and it's a story about how the world ends.

And there's a sequel, whose first chapter was released today.

Go read it, it's totally worth it. If any of these descriptions sound intriguing, that's what you'll find.&&It's probably my favourite superhero story ever, the summary the author put out at the beginning is a pretty good synopsis:

""An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the local ‘cape’ scene’s politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.

Just bear with the slow beginning, the high school stuff in the first few chapters is quickly left behind (even though I personally had absolutely no problems with it, it probably could scare some people off).&&[deleted]&&That might be true, but I think it's also a valid perspective to say they developed their personalities and domestic roles around their powers.  The ability to stretch would do wonders in the kitchen, and if you could turn invisible then it's simple to be introverted and observe.&&Well calling something a Fantastic Four movie is a bit of an insult&&Each person more or less has a unique power.

The dad is strong, the mom is elastic, daughter can go invisible, etc. There isn't a lot of people having overlapping powers, they each have their own thing is what I think he was referring to.

In DC/Marvel, a lot of people are super strong, have super reflexes, or have tech to make them super strong or have super reflexes. Same thing with a lot of other tech for other abilities like flight. There are only a few people who have unique powers.&&Invisible Girl could only turn in visible and was useless.  Her role was to sneak into places and get captured to be used as a hostage.  The fans complained - so they gave her a force field as well.  The force field is invisible - that's the only real connection.&&she's invisible because she has a force field around her&&Each of the character's powers tie into their personality.

Violet is shy, so she hides (Invisibility) and covers/protects herself (Force field).&&I always assumed that whatever mysterious force she wields is also capable of bending light.&&All their powers are based off of their personalities. Violet is shy and puts up barriers. Helen is flexible and holds the family together. Bob is strong emotionally and physically.&&I remember someone on here explained how each characters' powers related to their character. It went something like this;

Bob - both physically strong and head strong; the ideal image of how we (should) see our fathers as children

Helen - elastic; able to stretch and multitask like any hardworking mother can as well as having to stretch to accommodate for all the challenges family life brings

Dash - super speed; wild and uncontrollable as any rebellious youth tends to be at that age

Violet - invisibility and force fields; her anxiety and nervous temperament makes her socially invisible to her classmates and as a result, she builds up barriers between herself and those around her.

Jack Jack - mighty morphin (?); This is an odd one, but could represent a baby's potential to become anyone/anything depending on it's upbringing.

Syndrome - no powers, but an obsession with being seen as the hero; look up super hero syndrome. His entire character is built around it and it's awesome

Obviously this is all just fan interpretation, so take it with a pinch of salt,  but for me at least I find it really ties the whole film together and why I think the characters in the film truly are incredible.&&OP is from 2007 when this was true. &&They do that in Fantastic Four and the first X-Men. &&Even in the Fantastic Four movie from 2005 they defeat Doom by using their power together, although it is pretty obvious that they had no idea how to include the rock dude, so they just made him destroy a fire hydrant. &&it tends to be the focus of the incredibles where others use it on occasion, the avengers tend to go all off on their own for fights fairly often. 

to be fair coming together as a family was a big part of the incredibles. and as a kid movie they did not have to emphasis ego issues like all audience themed shows would. 

EDIT: i am just trying to explain the likely thought process of OP here, not saying other movies dont use teamwork at all. &&Yes, she instead starts fucking people up with her bugs.

The story was started as a writing project for the author to practice his writing, and it definitely shows a bit, I promise the writing improves a ton, and is more than made up for by the sheer character and world building.

This story is the epitome of gray morality, from start to end.

Arc 1-2 is kinda cheesy character introduction, then shit takes off with arc 3-4, and doesn't stop escalating from there. From team hero-villain fights to the very appropriately named ""Endbringers"" 

LMK if you'd like a bit more spoilery mention of some of what's to come to get you interested in making it past the beginning. It's 100% worth it though, I've never heard of anyone who kept it up and didn't get absorbed into it other than someone who culdn't handle how dark it got.
&&Yeah she gets over that pretty quickly and gets a bit brutal. The author doesn't shy away from the descriptions either. He explains what species go in what holes and how they bite, sting, or poison the poor bastards who thought the bug girl wasn't that dangerous.&&construction worker, yoga teacher, firefighter, and ninja... new Village People group or new superhero team?  the answer may surprise you&&Nah, the Roger Corman Fantastic Four is still the best.&&Am I the only one who didn't hate the Tim Story films?&&Good. The F4 deserve a high bar. &&A bit different, because there are good Star Trek movies and it's debatable whether Galaxy Quest is better than all of them or not.  While the recent Fantastic Four movies have all just been straight-up terrible.&&RIP Alan Rickman &&If you mean behind wrath of Khan,  undiscovered country,  and first contact then I agree. &&I was pleasantly surprised by Seth McFarlane's The Orville so far as an homage to TNG.&&The only thing that isn't the best Fantastic Four movie ever made is any Fantastic Four movie ever made.&&This is one of those comments that made me laugh so hard, I had to come back and find it just to upvote.&&Don't they superheat him inside a force field dome, then Ben breaks off a hydrant and Reed directs water at him to anneal/quench him?&&Your thinking of when Doom  freezes Mr.fantastic &&Marvel is in talks to buy the Film and TV divisions from Fox, so that could actually happen!&&The post is talking about consistently using their powers together, to make the team actually feel cohesive rather than a series of scenes focusing on each character's powers in isolation. The first movie had everyone using their powers together exactly _once_ rather than throughout, and RotSS just gave up and gave one person all the powers rather than actually having the team show teamwork.&&The ball of hate has already started rolling. There's no stopping it now.&&Yeah but at the end of the first movie they use them as a team to defeat doom&&I'm from México and everyone and their cat already saw the movie, so I just thought it was released worldwide tbh.

[It looks like it's only avaiable in México right now and will roll out worldwide on the 22nd](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=pixar1117.htm). I guess they DID released it earlier here so that it matched with *Día de Muertos* but they're holding on the rest of the world because of Thor?&&The prison escape in the first Kung Fu Panda was amazing. It's awesome that you could see it come together from the inside. 

One of the great things about Tai Lung in particular was his sheer  presence as a villain, almost like Darth Vader if you get what I mean. 

I also liked Lord Shen in KFP 2, his fighting style was fantastically animated, and Gary Oldman was well cast as more of a moustache twirling kind of baddie.&&KFP and How to Train Your Dragon made me finally give DreamWorks some notice. They are both so good.&&no doubt, how to train your dragon is one of the most heartfelt cartoons in history. were definitely in a golden age of animated movies, as great as the little mermaid/aladin/rescuers generation was.&&The bridge scene is pure awesome as well.&&Prison escape in KFP and Puss in Boots fighting the guards in Skrek 2 had some of the best choreography for fight scenes for the decade IMO, you should be very proud do be associated with them.&&Even his CGI characters do their own stunts.&&That scene made me sad :(&&That was an amazing scene.&&Except that in the end it's shown that had Iron Man been trying to kill them both from the beginning instead of just Bucky, he would have trashed them both no problem.&&Paul Rudd being one of the goofier superhero in the MCU is smart casting in my opinion. &&I love his nicknames&&Except Hawkeye will be out of arrows, so Groot will grow one and hand it to him, so he'll be involved as well.&&Great now ant man is stuck inside an impenetrable force field with Thanos. &&I highly doubt disney will have two ancillary Avengers be the ones to defeat the villain they've been setting up for almost a decade. It will either be Iron Man or Capt. America solo or together; the core 4 all together,  or all of them together some how.&&This would be incredible and I hope this plays out, if only so you can yell ""I TOLD YOU SO 2 YEARS AGO!"" when it happens. &&Dude, you stole this from JLA: Rock of Ages.

But, yeah. That would be really cool.&&Dude was that not exactly how green arrow and atom take down darkseid that time?&&Which makes no sense. Photons are point particles, you can’t “shrink” to a point.&&And then DC/Warner Brothers will most likely attempt to sue for literally copying them word for word from one of their books.&&What is the Get Help scene?

I'm drawing a blank. &&That 1st one annoys the geek in my a little bit. Caps shield is made out of Vibranium which absorbs vibrations. It's why he can take a hit from Thor or Hulk and shrug it off.

In that clip we are seeing Cap hold up his vibration absorbing shield for Thor to hit and somehow shockwaves come out and knock a bunch of people down.&&Wow. If I squint really hard, I can almost see the animation those awful Tumblr gifs are trying to depict. Almost.&&I think Thor smashes caps shield to concuss everyone in the area&&The thing where Thor hits the shield with Mjolnir to cause a shockwave.&&She must have played Portal&&That might’ve been one of my favorite scenes in an X-Men movie fight. &&If you're not watching it, Blink is a main character in The Gifted. Her powers aren't yet as insanely cool as they were in DOFP and there's obviously less of a budget - but still the CGI is pretty good for a TV show (better than Netflix) and Blink may be gearing up to do cooler shit. There was an episode where her powers go haywire and make portal madness destruction.&&Fastball Special.&&Yeah I was thinking that too! The X-Men Evolution animated series was basically about them learning how to use their powers together as a team. &&I thought not. It's not a story the Brotherhood would tell you.&&That seems a little weird considering that Spawn has the biggest cape in the history of comics.&&The joke was there because his cape was actually useful, right? I barely remember the movie but I still remember every detail from the scene where his cape helps him hide on the building.&&Except the family part. Hmm is it the only movie with a married superhero couple?&&Or a useful one like Spawn.&&vigilantism, fear of becoming unattractive to your partner, the villain kills heroes and plans to stage a false flag attack...&&[""A cape?""... ""A weapon""](https://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/batman-vs-birthday-boy-earth-1-4.jpg)&&Plus sometimes he’s got weights at the bottom to beat the shit out of people with it if he so chooses. &&I'm sorry, does Edna say ""No capes unless it's a glider?""

[Let's find out](https://media.giphy.com/media/dePaPOPNSLDsk/giphy.gif)&&Serious though, he and Robin are the only characters I can say deserve their capes. They function as gliders and meld with their fighting style by using it to conceal movements or blind the enemy. Functional capes for functional heroes.&&It's not even that exceptional, plenty of (modern) capes have actual purposes. Superman's cape is almost indestructible, not too useful for someone who is indestructible himself, but useful for any civilians he wants to protect from gunfire that might miss his silhouette. Thor's cape allows him to create tornadoes. Dr Strange's cape has superpowers of its own. 

Granted this is arguably a product of the decades many superheroes have had, and thus have had plenty of writers who put their own spin on why these capes exist in the first place.&&Plus it tends to be detachable. &&It also helps you blend in with the shadows which is kind of his thing.&&Batman also uses it for intimidation. Fear is kinda his whole thing, it's the reason he dresses up as a bat in he first place. &&And a shield (for flames and small shrapnel, not bullets)&&Also, aesthetic is a big part of batman. He wants to look fearsome for psychological purposes, and nothing makes you look more badass than a black cape.&&It can be a glider, bullet proof, fire proof and many other things. Batman has more than one cape.&&Not only is it an actual gadget that he uses in fighting crime, but also I'm 100% sure Batman has a quick failsafe for if his cape were to become a hazard.&&Fun fact: no they didn't. The devs had an extra anti-piracy check in the game that would break glide if it detected the game was modified. Pirates cracked the standard anti-piracy stuff, didn't notice the glide anti-piracy check and uploaded their release. People played far enough to get stuck when glide didn't work, complained, and devs pointed out it was an anti-piracy check and that people complaining should actually buy the game, or something to that effect. (Edit: direct quote below)

>The problem you have encountered is a hook in the copy protection, to catch out people who try and download cracked versions of the game for free. It's not a bug in the game's code, it's a bug in your moral code.

This isn't uncommon at all. There are tons of off the shelf game protections, but once pirates crack a protection other games using it are easy to crack. Game devs throw in their own anti-piracy triggers to slow down a working crack. The best of these triggers aren't immediately obvious and may not show up for quite a while, because that makes it more likely a cracker won't notice it. It's a fairly longstanding tradition and isn't limited to PC games - offhand Earthbound on SNES and Spyro on PSX come to mind.&&Jokes on them, I finished that game without a working cape just teleporting around.&&His superpower is wealth:

1) Batman needs something.  
2) Batman buys it.  
3) Criminals pay.

&&They are buddies technically, since the cape is sentient.&&That's just in the movie. &&woah green lantern wore a cape? when did he lose his cape?&&Magneto.&&[deleted]&&Oh.....I’ve never seen Spawn, always heard bad things about it. 

That confirmed it. That was awful. &&Man, I forgot that Marten Sheen was in that movie.

Unseeing it, there's your problem right there.&&Were you after a video of a guy motor boating his mom that wasn't nsfw &&Also, I remember for years his response to ""will there ever be a sequel to Incredibles?"" was along the lines of ""I'd love to make one, but I only want to make it if we have a really good story for it, not just force it.""  So assuming that stayed true, and they're making Incredibles 2 because they had a story that they wanted to make and not because Disney told them to make it or whatever, then that's also a good sign.&&Yes. [Brad Bird is directing](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt3606756/?ref=m_nv_sr_2).&&No, it was definitely a good movie, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping it would be just as good, if not better than the first.  Finding Nemo holds a spot in my heart as one of the best movies for a kid and an adult, and I thought Finding Dory was more focused on appealing to kids.  I guess I was hoping for another Toy Story 3.&&That movie didn’t make me laugh once tbh. Dory had me in stitches in Finding Nemo so I was pretty disappointed. &&Finding Dory was the third worst Pixar film if you include Cars 2. Dory was already the worst work character they'd created. She was completely against the Pixar writing rules. She was Dory ex machine. And then they make a store movie about her that ends in a sequence in which fish are driving a car? It was some early DreamWorks style bs. &&I can't wait to see what they do with Jack in the sequel. He was a complete freakshow.&&Yeah The incredibles has way better story than any of the Fantastic Four.&&You're a Fantastic Four movie!&&The indepentend superpower thing has been done a bunch though. In fact it's been done to the point where I think it's overused. Off the top of my head I can mention X-men and the tv show Heroes, and from the anime side you have Hero Academia, for example. I'm sure there are tons more.&&I mean....they only had 4 people to give powers to, it'd be real shitty if there was overlap after 6 decades of super power ""research"". But when you get to the point where you have dozens of characters, ofc you're gonna have some overlap. The original DC roster didn't have any overlapping. Outside of Thor having super strength (which is more of a side effect of his other powers than his main power), the original Avengers didn't have any overlapping. The Fantastic Four and X-Men didn't have any overlap. It seems like it's more of a basic requirement. 

The only reason why modern day teams have overlap is simply because a) so many characters change rosters, b) the teams get so big that overlapping occurs, and c) people fall in love with the characters instead of the powers.  &&StrongestAvenger&&The fans complained? I don't recall the edit where she didn't use force fields. 

Edit: oh, you mean the comic!&&Not true.

Invisibility and force fields are separate powers.

On top of playing the mildly funny, kind of average every day guy in a lot of roles, he's a really cool guy in real life. So to see him get a role that's not only real cool but also a really good paying gig that he'll have for a while is great. Well deserved.&&Nah, his bow breaks. Groot makes a bow, spiderman strings it, rocket cobbles up an arrow and doctor strange bends reality to make the shot possible. Then ant man gets in but can't beat him, so he disables the forcefield allowing the rest if the team to take him out.&&Or rocket will make one out of nearby rubble&&And Robbie Reyes shows up and gives Thanos the ol' penance stare. &&Flies right into his eye and...

Spoilers!&&The first time Thor struck the shield with Mjolnir, the head-on hit was redirected in all directions, resulting in a shockwave that knocked down trees in a wide area. That seems to be consistent with striking the shield at an angle and sending the blast in a direction, as in the gif. In both cases, redirection and not absorption.

On the other hand, when Agent Carter fires a few rounds at the thing in CA:FA, instead of ricocheting the slugs just plop down on the ground at Caps feet. So it's a bit inconsistent. Maybe there's some minimum threshold of power you need to get deflection instead of 100% absorption?
 
""That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.""&&The shield in the movies seems to be a completely different version, since it doesn't follow any of the rules set out in the comics (or the laws of physics for that matter.)&&Shit, if you're going by actual science logic then his shield shouldn't even bounce if it absorbs all of the energy it's hit with or even make sound for that matter.&&[deleted]&&You're forgetting that Thor's hammer and Cap's shield did that the first time Cap blocked a Thor hit.

Someone theorized that if a certain vibration threshold is hit, shockwave occurs and Thor is the only one who can hit hard enough consistently to produce a shockwave.&&[""Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A11yHOXzsaE#t=9m50s)

https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/3/37/Green_Lantern_Alan_Scott_0008.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130326081040

Scott had an entirely different backstory and mythos to him, in much the same way that the original Human Torch was an android named Jim Hammond that had nothing to do with the Fantastic Four:

The OG GL was Alan Scott, premiering in July 1940, who had various magical abilities including projecting constructs,  with his only weakness being wood and to a lesser degree plant matter, as opposed to the colour yellow and fear (later overcome) that Hal Jordan and other members of the Green Lantern Corp experienced. When Hal Jordan was introduced, he had the sleek space suit.  Alan Scott is still kicking and still has the original costume. &&The original Green Lantern (Alan Scott) wore a cape. subsequent GLs haven't.&&He's sort of right. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Scott

Although now they are opening their new Pixar movie only 3 weeks before the new Star Wars movie.

Thanks!&&Lol it doesn’t follow the laws of physics at all and I get that. It’s a made up material as well so there’s that. They can decide how to use it and I don’t need them to spend a full minute explaining it on screen for all of us and it was a cool effect. It just literally gives me that little twinge and then I move on. Trying reason I’m bringing it up right now is because it’s relevant to what we are all talking about. &&He reflects a stream of bullets during the street fire fight I'm pretty sure. &&Look, kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.&&It does actually follow physics more than you’d think. The bounce, for instance, works quite well, and how it works makes sense of how it can create a shockwave rather than just absorbing the impact from the hammer.  

https://youtu.be/qa543cXVZTY&&Technically speaking, something that absorbs all vibrations would be completely immovable. Motion can be thought of as a superposition of very long wavelength vibrations. &&Lol yeah. 

I consider myself in good company when Spider-Man agrees with me. &&It’s whenever Wolverine gets thrown at someone. In the comics he does it with quite a few people. &&Yeah he’s a bit of an exception. I mean in it’s first iteration his cape was a hell-born parasite that fed on souls.&&Yeah and I'm sure you've never bitten your tongue or smashed your finger before.&&“THEY PLAYED US LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE!”&&A Hin-D?&&""Metal Gear...?""&&!&&the birthday hat is the problem, not the bag covering his face...&&Starting to sing the Batman theme to himself. &&Honestly, I always thought it was either (a) getting smacked in the eyes with the cape would hurt or (b) it's blowing dust/dirt into their eyes and blinding them.&&I had assumed since it becomes rigid to glide it becomes rigid when he stuns with it&&He passes a current through it to make it become rigid, so I think it’s a combination of being hit with a heavy blanket to the face and a mild shock. &&Um have you seen the tech in the super suits she makes?&&Ahem: “And it can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof... and machine washable, darling. That’s a new feature.”&&Woah... Easy now...

Those costumes accentuate their powers. Elastagirls stretches, violets goes invisible, etc. That's a bit more than just a costume.&&She makes suits for supers which Batman isn't so Edna would not make costume for him in first place.&&I used to design for GODS!&&So what you're saying is Edna needs to team up with Hiro Hamada and Disney needs to get on an Incredible Big Hero 6 cross over? &&You're actually right on the nose with that one. His cape does have thermal shielding and protective capabilities while also being his glider. &&Not gonna lie, as someone in a northern state heading into winter, I really wish cloaks/capes would make a fucking comeback.

Thanks a lot Game of Thrones.  You made incest popular, but couldn't get goddamn warm cozy cloaks back in vogue, even with all the ""Winter is Coming"" nonsense.  Winter comes every year up here.  I want to be able to buy a bitchin' cloak!&&Winners don't use drugs (unless they're Captain America).&&Well, I mean. That's how Arkham Knight ends.&&Both stories got retconned so Alan Scott *did* have something to do with Oa and the Power Rings, and Human Torch eventually is turned into Vision, and the Human Torch's inventor's daughter ends up dating (and helping) FF-Human Torch.

It's a pretty firm law of comics that all characters will eventually be seen again in some form.&&That looks like a cross between Robin and Doctor Strange.&&Well, I don't know about proper. He says himself that the Guardians only really recognize him with an honorary title, but he's not part of the corps.&&And it was clipping through some of the people. &&The clip isn't NSFW fyi, pornhub used ironically as the punchline. Obviously not explainable to a boss though. &&Well, I think I'd read that specifically from Brad Bird himself, not just a Pixar spokesperson, but you might be right.

Granted, personally, I haven't seen their Cars sequels, but I've enjoyed all their others.  The Toy Story sequels are fantastic, and I enjoyed both Monsters University and Finding Dory even if they might not have been quite as good as the originals.  If Incredibles 2 is as good as those, I'll be happy.  If it's as good as Toy Story 3, then I'll really be thrilled.&&One of the few trilogys that get better with every movie IMO. &&Great. Now I need kleenexes again

&&From what the director said, the movie literally picks up right where the last one ended. The fight with Underminer.&&Guess it helps that we weren't introduced to more than a handful of Incredibles, then. I would suspect we'd have more overlap with more people.&&I mean prof x and jean are quite similar, Wolverine has the woman in X2 and his kind of daughter in Logan with similar powers.

And they're main cast for sure. &&Tetsutetsu and kirishima’s rivalry turned bromance is amazing. Also body no hero academia isn’t a great example of independent powers because of all the people who inherited their parents powers/have super stength.&&Or telepathy, healing factor, energy projection.&&Possibly. It’s hard to tell unless they come right out and say it. To me they seem like 2 separate powers. &&/r/idbuythatforadollar&&He shall be avenged!&&I think the difference is Coco and StarWars are opening over holiday weekends, when families typically go see movies regardless. Disney needed a family friendly movie for both holidays, so I think they will be fine and won't have much cannibalization of profits. &&Definitely. Disney owns so many properties now that overlap between tentpole features is unavoidable. &&That moment when the whole movie was just about grown adults getting their feelings hurt. &&Norton and Howard were both recast due to both being very difficult to work with. Howard had even more baggage with pending domestic assault charges, not getting along with cast members etc. so I have read...not that I was there. &&*Terrance Howard quietly lifts a finger*&&Uh, Rhodes?&&If you don't watch Agents of Shield, he's a major character in Season 4 and it's pretty great. &&Ah, cockvore.&&r/sounding&&SPOILER WARNING: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpZakOJlRoY&&Everything you say is spot on. I wasn't disparaging your comment, or the movies in question. I was just indulging in a little bit of light fan wank. And this is the internet, exactly the right place to overanalyze a trivial detail from a comic book movie. :)&&Well at least we can't use the speed force excuse for this one.  That one is the worst in terms of nothing makes sense&&That stream of bullets came from a minigun in Winter Soldier iirc which has significant more force than a handgun from the 40s.  Which again brings up the minimum threshold of power for deflection.  If someone tracked it in the movies it is probably inconsistent but still a decent enough in world explanation given the conceits. &&Oooh, interesting conundrum, if it absorbs all vibrations, shouldn't it interfere with not only all sound in its vicinity, but also any wave along the EM spectrum?&&Doctor Strange’s cape is pretty cool.&&That's 90s comics as fuck&&Ya but would you give up your arms just cause you bump into stuff once in a while. Spawn’s “cape” did more actual fighting than he did.  &&I'm also not a superhero.&&IN AN OPEN FIELD!&&What’s a Russian gunship doing here?&&[Psycho Mantis?](https://youtu.be/p8iBBJE_MZ0)&&You're that ninja!&&You can have a birthday hat or you can have a burlap-sack mask, not both. You get ONE thing.

You don't see Batman going around calling himself BatAndRacoonMan or some shit.&&Pocket sand!&&Also it is unaffected by gravity when he hangs upside down, I always thought that was cool, it would look weird if it hung past his head.&&Have you seen my super suit?&&They're machine washable, darling!&&That's not accentuating their powers, it's just not inhibiting them.&&Batman was addicted to proto-venom at one point.&&Uncle Ben was always a rule breaker.&&just like a real cape
&&[deleted]&&Give him a hand!  He's British!&&I mean, Cap was fighting because a man he knew had been brainwashed was being framed and would've been killed without a trial if he hadn't gotten involved. Iron Man was fighting to preserve the Avengers and to make sure that situations like Ultron never happen again. I honestly thought that was pretty clear throughout the movie.

On the other hand, you can take a movie like BvS and say that it's a movie about someone's feelings getting hurt (Batman), and despite everyone around him telling him it's a mistake (not to mention things like seeing Superman save many lives every day for 2 full years), he decides that he needs to murder Superman in cold blood.&&That’s not why he was recast. He was recast because he didn’t wanna take a pay cut for *Iron Man 2*.&&Sounds like he was just trying to play a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.&&tbh im glad don cheadle has the role now bc i like him as an actor, but i liked terrence howard more as rhodes and i thinkk he wouldve been a better war machine&&Forgot all about him, lol.

I just keep imagining it was Don Cheadle the entire time.&&Probably the fetish that breaks the most laws of biology (after macro).&&I never want to see this word again.&&That was a great scene, and the follow up immediately afterwards made it even better.

Also, that back pat...&&I didn’t feel attacked. I wouldn’t argue comic logic on Reddit if I had a thin skin. :p&&Honestly, there is no way to describe a material that ""absorbs all vibrations"" in a physically consistent way. The thing would violate all kinds of conservation laws, and would be completely immovable. How it would interact with electromagnetic waves would have to be made up and arbitrary, because there's no physical way to model it.

The easiest thing to do would be for it to be completely transparent to EM waves (which are not themselves vibrations, they are merely propagating oscillations of the electromagnetic field vector). Materials that interact with EM waves vibrate when exposed to them, whereas materials that don't interact with them are just transparent. If the shield is transparent to EM waves, there's no issue; however we know that it absorbs in at least the visible spectrum (since we see it!), and so it would somehow have to absorb light without vibrating, and that is literally impossible based on physics as we know it...

TL;DR There is no point asking questions like that. The answer is arbitrary, because the ""absorbs vibrations"" feature is fundamentally nonsensical from a physical perspective. It behaves however the authors want it to behave, just like most superhero stuff does!&&And it has a mind of its own, and keeps him out of danger&&BRING ME THE NANOMACHINE STRETCHER SON&&Sha-Sha!&&My evening is in danger! &&WHERE IS MY SUPER SUIT?!?!&&Still waiting for the Obamas to do a version of this. &&That's a new feature!&&And they breathe like Egyptian cotton&&I don't know about that, many of the suits were bulletproof, fireproof, etc. So they do provide a durability increase. I forget if it provides other benefits.&&They all have a tracker, Helens can withstand explosions, either jack jacks or they all are bulletproof, fireproof etc, they definitely help&&Do you have clothes that turn invisible?&&But he kicked his addiction eventually, and I for one applaud him for that.&&Well, Bucky used to be a rule breaker too. Problem with Ben is that he's not interesting. His job is done.

In ""Marvel 1602"" Rennaisance Reed Richards has a theory that the universe runs on stories and that everybody on earth is practically immortal, as long as they are *interesting*. That's also why he can't truly cure Ben Grimm (The Thing), because the universe will eventually revert him back to his ""interesting"" form. That's a good theory for comic book universes in general. :)&&The fact that he was facing felony domestic adult charges didn’t exactly help either . Disney /Marvel didn’t want the optics of a wife beater in their family friendly movie. Many of his scenes with RDJ had to be re shot due to their lack of chemistry. Studios don’t like expensive re shots ( hint...hard to work with) 
 He was reportedly told if he wanted to return as Rhodie, he would be paid the same rate ( Howard’s version is he was offered less) . But he was also told that Rhodie would be killed off early in a sequel. 
  It’s a he said/she said. Howard can blame whoever he wants, but at the end of the day...it’s pretty much his own ego that go him booted out of the MCU.&&The whore is ACTIIIIIVATED&&I am the greatest good you are ever gonna get!&&""Jack Jack doesn't have any powers.""

""Hm? Well, they're quite fabulous anyway.""&&A tracking device. And most important of all, the suits are machine washable.&&What good is a fireproof suit that doesn’t completely cover you&&He also has no idea how math works so maybe he was actually offered more.&&RUUUULES OF NATURE!&&And they breathe like Egyptian cotton.&&I hear that's a new feature&&[I'm told that's a new feature.](https://imgur.com/fzlrsyG)&&That's a new feature&&That’s a new feature&&Karma for everyone that points out it's a new feature!&&Better then a completely non fireproof suit?
