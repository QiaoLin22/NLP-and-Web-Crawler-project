""I say Watson, youre not a doctor. You sir are a big fat curly headed FUCK""&&I'm Holmes, he's Watson, we're here to fuck shit up. &&I hope this movie is dead serous. &&Shake and bake 'till the motherfucking tea time&&Boats and Holmes&&scenes when it turns out to be one of Dale and Brennan's activities&&* Will Ferrell
* Benedict Cumberbatch
* Ian Mckellen
* Robert Downey Jr.
* Johnny Lee Miller

All *currently* play Sherlock Holmes. I cannot wait until more fictional characters are treated with such creative openness, both made by Hollywood and received by a friendly audience. &&PRESTIGE WORLDWIDE^wide^wide^wide^wide&&Man it's gotta suck to be Etan Cohen

Not because like his life sucks or whatever, I'm sure he's rich as fuck etc

He's just destined to have people get really excited to meet him for like 30 seconds until hey see the missing H yknow&&I‚Äôm hoping for cameos from RDJ and Benebunches Cumberland.&&""Did we just become best detectives?""

""YUP!""&&I'm not sure what to do with my hands.&&This reminded me I would like another Sherlock Holmes with RDJ and Jude Law. I was a fan of both of them.&&Reilly has a lot coming out. This, the Laurel & Hardy movie, the western. Wreck It Ralph.&&My name is Watson ... but you have to call me Dragon&&I think I‚Äôm more excited about this movie than any other. I know it got lots of hate but The House with Will Ferrell was one of the funniest movies I‚Äôd seen in a long time. For some reason just seeing Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly on the the movie screen makes me instantly giddy. &&#*PRESTIGE WORLDWIDE*
&&Man why can't John C Reiley be Holmes? You know, maybe just this one time, maybe he could be the lead?&&These two have great on-screen chemistry. Can‚Äôt wait for this one.&&How great would it be if at the end of this movie the mom from stepbrothers shows up in regular clothing and says ‚ÄúBrennan! Dale! I said dinner is ready!‚Äù And interrupts them playing with Sherlock Holmes and Watson action figures all over the basement. &&that's uhhhhhh.....a poster? I guess&&this didn't age well&&Looks like it‚Äôs going to terrible, I am excited. &&I will always watch Ferrell/Reily movies &&I have a feeling this will end with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly revealing they're playing pretend as Step Brothers thus revealing an upcoming Step Brothers 2.&&Can't wait for their next music video, 'Watson 'N Hoes.""&&the mother fuckin Catalina Wine Mixer!&&Just based on the poster, I know I'm gonna love this. So happy to see Ferrell and Reilly back together. &&##fuck yes. Gonna get so high and see this shit. Some well deserved relaxation time with some golden entertainers.&&Yikes...&&Did they just become best friends ?&&Well now that he's in it, Ralph Fiennes is definitely pulling the ol ""good guy turned bad"" scheme&&Is Sherlock Holmes the fictional character starring in the most simultaneously existing franchises?&&Sir Arthur is turning in his grave&&They are great together &&Shake and bake!&&I feel so sad for my friends who don't think they're funny.... such a waste&&This aged well&&I just really dislike will ferrell's acting and I can never place why&&This looks horrible&&Finally a version of Holmes that involves his hard drug usage.&&Maybe we'll finally solve the mystery to the Pan Pamn situation&&I can't help having a bad feeling about this. &&Any movie with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly together is always a blast&&Fuckin' Catalina wine mixer&&Where‚Äôs the trailer!?&&Interestingy I was supposed to be in this movie, i turned up at Angels costumes in london, tried on my uniform, was asked to grow my hair and beard out more. A few weeks later I got an email saying that they needed the uniform for John C. Reilly as i was exactly the same size (the uniform was and old British khaki uniform with pith helmet). I did however leave a fart in the trousers, Hope you enjoyed them John you uniform stealing, good acting, fart pants wearing gentleman. &&Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

hmmmm


Could be great. Could be absolute the worst dogshit I've ever seen.

Poster alone, I think I'm edging towards the latter, but it would be a welcome surprise.&&I could not be less interested...&&When Will Ferrell is funny I'll watch one of his movies. It hasn't happened yet. &&Tim and Eric better be in this as well...&&HARD PASS&&Thank you jesus &&If any other actors were in this, I would have low expectations. But I have faith in Dragon and Nighthawk.&&I remember reading a TIL about a Sherlock knock off from back in the day where the guy just did a bunch of cocaine to solve crimes. Now all I can think about is this was a missed opportunity....&&John C. Reilly is the only person on Earth who seems capable of making Will work hard. He brings out the best in him, so this makes me hopeful for once about a movie with Ferrell.&&I love SH.
Will is great but is not Sherlock! 
&&I hope I don't have to hate this movie. &&These two need to play Mario and Luigi. &&Chad Smith should play Moriarty.&&I‚Äôm 75% sure that this movie is going to end with them waking up in their self made bunk beds from stepbrothers, and together say ‚Äúdid we just become super best friends‚Äù&&I want this to be a secret Step Brothers  sequel that gets revealed to be a sequel at the last 5 minutes of the movie.&&DAD PLEASE SHUT UP!!!&&Last week we put liquid paper on a bee and it....it died.&&[deleted]&&ITS THE FUCKING CATALINA WINE MIXER&&Worldwide ^Worldwide&&Now I'm expecting the ending to have someone yelling cut in the background and it turns out the step brothers have started their own successful movie company. Smash cut ""The Step Brothers will Return""&&From my chest pubes down to my ball fro....&&That would be fucking great if they put a prestige worldwide logo in the credits
&&Hey fuckers, welcome to the neighborhood, if you ever need any fertilizer I‚Äôve got a lot of it, close to 80 tons&&Is it ok that my costume is not movie quality?&&YOU JAGALOONS YOURE FAILURES!

FAAAAAAAIL UUUUUUUUUURES&&This has to be the most quotable movie of all time&&You fucking jagaloons&&Let the dirt just shower over you&&I'm gonna put my nut sack on your drum set!&&Stopping crime at the Catalina wine mixer&&Hey y'all don't say that!&&""I'm gonna take a pillowcase...and fill it...full of bars of soap and beat the shit out of you""&&> you better not goto sleep

Never use goto.&&I placethed my testicles on your violin good sir&&Moriarty, your geriatric fuck! &&I still wish McBride got to be Moriarty&&Step-Brethren&&Pam, there's a D at the end.&&Hellooooo Miss Lady.&&Check out Casa De Mi Padre if you haven't already. Will Farrell with Mexican soap stars making a completely serious Mexican soap - in Spanish.

Will Ferrell didn't know Spanish when they started shooting. &&i &&Same style of humor as leslie in Airplane! would be perfect&&That might make it even more funny &&I hope it's rated R.&&It literally says comedy in the title. But if you want something dry, check out The Little Hours. 


It‚Äôs on Netflix and it has Aubrey plaza, late micucci, Alison Brie, John c Reilly, Dave Franco, Molly Shannon, nick offernman, and Fred armisen&&With a poster like that? &&Shakaabaaahhh&&221B Shake and Baker Street&&What's the over/under on Watson uttering the line ""No shit, Sherlock"" at any point in the film?&&The origin of my username&&üëÅüëÅ
   üëÖ&&You have to cal me... night hawk. &&Well, yeah.  They have so much more room now.&&You have the word ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù italicized, but Ian Mckellen is **not** currently playing Sherlock Holmes... that was a single film over 3 years ago.&&I can't wait for the crossover movie where they have to stop Moriarty together.&&Well that's one way to positively spin this.&&I remember one of the ones RDJ was in came out Christmas day as well. I saw it in theaters.&&Too bad everything after like 1900 is never gonna be public domain thanks to Disney seemingly being able to rewrite copyright law whenever it feels like it &&It's called ""Public Domain""&&Benedict is my favorite Sherlock. He is great actor and he fits that role &&Johnny Depp too&&I still want Sherlock Holmes 3 like right fucking now please. Thank you.&&For a second I thought they were all going to be in this movie. I'm a little disappointed. &&Then there‚Äôs ~~the Elementary series with the female Sherlock, as well as~~ characters the draw the majority of their traits from Sherlock, like House MD.&&Shame, the only trivia on his IMDB page is that he isn't Ethan Coen. Poor lad&&It's not missing, it just moved&&Isn't this how Bill Murray ended up doing Garfield?&&Is this the same one that wrote Garfield and bill Murray was confused into signing up &&My mind is blown I thought you had just spelt Ethan wrong and you just thought it would suck to be him.

Nope, man's parents god damn went and named him Etan. &&He attended a screening of Idiocracy I went to last year and he mentioned this movie during the Q&A....was the first I had heard of it.   Super nice guy, really funny.  &&*sigh... here we go again* Benefactor Cinderblock&&I think you mean Burlington Coatfactory&&Oh you mean Bimblywickens Crackergraham?

&#x200B;

P.S. Pengwings&&Beenabitch Thundersnatch&&At this point I'm legitimately having to reread to spot the gaffs people make of his name. I automatically read his actual name no matter how it's spelled&&Barges and strumpets!&&No apostrophe &&üëç &&There‚Äôs gonna be one! &&2020&&[The Sisters Brothers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4971344/)

Can't wait; the book was great.&&John C Reilly is a god damn national treasure.&&You have to call me...Nighthawk&&***WIDE***&&It‚Äôs shake and bake not bake and shake &&Right but the thing is if he‚Äôs the lead...then Will Ferrel can‚Äôt be in the lead. See? &&Go watch Walk Hard.&&Then there would be three different versions of Holmes in the MCU, which I'm all for. 

We need to get Will Farrell and Jude Law in the MCU now so that we can have three matching sets&&#**MA! THE MEATLOAF!**&&It's taco Tuesday! &&yeah i was like all I need to know is who wrote and directed it

so this guy Etan Cohen -- has a writing credit on idiocracy, and wrote tropic thunder.

He also directed get hard, which I didn't see but looked pretty bad.

But if he allows for these 2 to improvise then ... god damn, it will be the catalina fucking wine mixer&&I hope is it the dumbest movie I probably watch over 100 times in my lifetime.  &&I will definitely watch this, but the whole time I'll be waiting for them not to bother cutting out Ralph Fiennes just absolutely losing his shit on the two fucking around.&&You‚Äôre goddamn right you will &&I was just thinking about that.  During the end credits, they could pan out and show that the entire movie was from a screening of a project by Prestige Worldwide^wide^wide^wide.  I don‚Äôt expect it, but I‚Äôd love it.&&I thought it was called Boats ‚ÄòN Holmes&&Probably because he‚Äôs in a lot of bad movies. You should check out ‚ÄúEverything must go‚Äù for a more somber Ferrel performance. &&I‚Äôm a big Will Ferrell fan but I can‚Äôt stand his latest films. 

I think it‚Äôs the way he yells most of his lines which really does my head in. And most of his films involves the characters explaining each joke after it‚Äôs been told for another cheap laugh. It seems like his latest movies are just really dumbing it down for the audience. 

&&I personally grew tired of him as a leading man very quickly. I'll take him any day as a side character or even a cameo.&&Because he's always playing Will Ferrell.&&Agreed.  I think I‚Äôve narrowed it down to he overemphasizes and yells all the time.  And he isn‚Äôt even that funny when he tries to joke off the cuff either.&&God me too! Whenever it comes up nobody believes me. I'm pretty sure it's because (pretty much) all he does is ""stupid"" comedy. Like the joke hinges on his character being a fucking idiot. I can't fucking stand it. Steve Carrell is very similar.&&I too hate Will Ferrell as an actor. I feel like no matter the role he's in he seems to still play the same character at his core. The only movie with him I actually enjoy is Elf. &&Get ready for excessive swearing and slapstick humor &&Fuck yeah it does&&But he had sex with a tranny...When he was drunk. Don't you get it? It's hellarious...He doesn't even remember having sex with a tranny&&I feel the same way with Adam Sandler. &&As a competing pair of detectives, or the villains&&Is that the little baby Jesus, or the full-grown Jesus?&&After credit sequence of their Step Brothers characters pitching the movie in LA.&&RemindMe! 6 Months&&RemindMe! 6 Months&&Stage Coach and Hos! &&BOATS AND HOES&&You wrecked my fucking boat, you goon&&When I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a dinosaur. I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex more than anything in the world. I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard...and I chased the neighborhood cats, and I growled and I roared. Everybody knew me and was afraid of me. And then one day, my dad said, ""Bobby, you're 17. It's time to throw childish things aside."" And I said, ""Okay, Pop."" But he didn't really say that, he said, ""Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job."" But, you know, I thought to myself, ""I'll go to medical school...l'll practice for a little while, and then I'll come back to it.&&Who‚Äôs driving the boat?!?&&I DRIVE A DODGE STRATUS&&IF YOU DON‚ÄôT COME DOWN HERE AND WRITE ME AND DALE A CHECK, I‚ÄôM GONNA TAKE ONE OF THOSE FAKE HEARING AID DEVICES AND SHOVE IT SO FAR UP YOUR ASS, YOU‚ÄôLL BE ABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND OF YOUR SMALL INTESTINE AS IT PRODUCES *SHIT*!!!&&Security.

sorry to nitpick but it improves the line imo&&POW!&&IVE TRAVELLED 500 MILES TO GIVE YOU MY SEED&&ITS THE FUCKING CATALINA WINE MIXER&&‚ÄúWhen I cum I produce a quart‚Äù&&Mr Doback, I don't feel so good. &&I fucking hope&&""I like to have fresh fruit in the house and chocolate chips in my pancakes. ‚Äú&&she takes one look at me goes ‚Äúoh my god, I‚Äôve had the old bull now I want the young calf,‚Äù and she grabs me by the weiner. &&Hey Derek! Sprechen sie dick!&&Are Bonita fish big?&&Why are you so sweaty?&&This is a house of learned doctors&&You guys are slaughtering these quotes... &&‚ÄúI say, Watson, I do believe someone has left a substantial amount of ejaculate upon your writing notes!‚Äù

‚ÄúUuuh, y-yeah. Weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you believe it might be a part of some clever ruse perpetuated by that fiendish Professor Moriarty?‚Äù

‚Äú...YES! ABSOLUTELY! Moriarty! That... dick. An ejaculating dick. Which is exactly what he did.‚Äù

EDIT:

‚ÄúMoriarty, I demand you apologize to the good doctor for ruining his writing notes with your foul, ill-spread seed!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fuck did you just say to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came in Watson‚Äôs book. Apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit, I didn‚Äôt cum in his book!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you did!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt, dipshit. I came on your fireplace and on your stupid girly violin, but I did not cum in Watson‚Äôs book!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell there was cum in it, how did it get there!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, you‚Äôre the detective, asshole. Maybe he came in it himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs preposterous! Watson‚Äôs character is beyond moral questioning!‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously? Dude, have you smelled that sick fuck‚Äôs cane? It smells like the inside of a dog‚Äôs asshole!‚Äù

‚ÄúI have not been fucking dogs with my cane, Moriarty!‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit! Then why does it smell like the inside of a dog‚Äôs asshole?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs London and it‚Äôs the 1800‚Äôs!‚Äù

‚Äú...That‚Äôs a good fucking point.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe better question, my dear professor, would be why you know what the inside of a dog‚Äôs asshole smells like?‚Äù

‚ÄúBECAUSE I‚ÄôM FUCKING CRAZY! HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT ABOUT ME!?‚Äù

EDIT 2:

‚ÄúWatson... did you cum in your book?‚Äù

‚Äú...I‚Äôm sorry, Sherlock. I just get so proud of myself for writing such great stories and I just get so excited... and I don‚Äôt know. Plus with my war injury and-‚Äù

‚ÄúWatson, Watson, you can‚Äôt keep using your war injury for every problem that comes up in your life. You didn‚Äôt cum in your book because of your war injury, so don‚Äôt blame it on that. That‚Äôs a completely separate psychological issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know... should I go talk to a psychiatrist?‚Äù

‚ÄúThose don‚Äôt exist, Watson. In fact, if you tell anyone else about this, they‚Äôll report you to the police and they‚Äôll just execute you for being a sexual deviant. You need to deal with this in your own private way. The same way I deal with all my personal problems.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you deal with your problems, Sherlock?‚Äù

‚ÄúElementary, my dear Watson.‚Äù

*Holmes takes a huge huff of cocaine*

‚ÄúMMMMMMM-YEAH THAT‚ÄôS THE GOOD SHIT PAPA NEEDED! WOOOOOOO! YEAH! LET‚ÄôS GO SOLVE SOME MYSTERIES!‚Äù&&Um. Why is this *NOT A THING*?!&&Should have gotten Vince Vaughn.

>I pure, straight, *hate* you.&&Don't get me wrong, McBride is great and I could totally see that working, but I think this may benefit MORE from having a straight guy like Fiennes opposite these two. It worked quite well in Step Brothers. Imagine if the parents in that movie were also silly characters. Probably wouldn't have worked as well, I'd venture. Fiennes is a boss, he can do comedy straight man brilliantly. See: In Bruges.&&I think I may be able to help with the Pan/Pam dilemma.  &&Or A Deadly Adoption with Ferrell and Kristen Wiig.  It's a Lifetime movie played completely straight.  It's weird as hell.  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deadly_Adoption&&Sorry, but Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are not mere Mexican soap starts!&&I don't want to give anything away but >!Really only the actors are acting seriously. It goes pretty deep into absurdist film making and does a great job eschewing classic low budget film tropes.!<&&IT'S ON NETFLIX! IT IS ON NETFLIX!&&Interesante&&Completely serious? There are so many jokes in that movie! The jokes are very subtle gags but it's a comedy for sure. 2 examples I can think of are when Will Ferrell is trying to hand roll a cigarette and after several failed attempts he pulls out a pack of marlboros and takes one out. It's as if the director said ""fuck it, he's never going to get this, just give the character a goddamn back up pack of manufactured cigarettes."" And at a dinner scene there was one character (Molly Shannon?) who had a different pair of glasses every time it cut to her. Like, 8 different pairs of glasses. I think there was something weird and funny about a mannequin in that scene too but its been a few years since I've seen it&&Wait, that was real? I thought that was a joke as part of this interview 

https://youtu.be/np4ipA0uX6w&&Good point, I hadn't thought about that.&&am serous. and don't call me shrley&&Or even anything like ‚ÄòWithout a clue‚Äô (Sir Michael Caine as Holmes and Sir Ben Kingsley as dr Watson). Fantastic movie with an interesting twist.&&yah, but you just know its going to be the same damn movie those two have made a dozen times already.&&It rhymes. And they‚Äôre both verbs. &&This needs more upvotes.&&Fuck, that‚Äôs good&&üëÅüëÑüëÅ&&You have to call me... dragon. &&So much more room for mysteries!&&[deleted]&&Played by Josh Brolin&&It's like a Dr Who Christmas Special&&The Adventure Zone did a special episode for backers where they played [Four Sherlock Holmes and a Vampire (Who Is Also One of the Aforementioned Sherlock Holmes)](https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1491/35/1491350819880.pdf)&&this is actually a pretty good look at public domain characters getting ransacked and different interpretations of those characters


https://youtu.be/tdR_GU3Hi9U&&we just need the ""HOLLYWOOD IS CREATIVELY BANKRUPT!!"" comment, and everything will be perfectly balanced, as all things should be&&Copyrights tend to ruin this. I'd love to see other people's takes on disney stories&&Christmas 2009, yeah? i remember going and seeing it with a friend over winter break my senior year of high school. what a fun film that was! i love cumberbatch's sherlock, but RDJ played the role incredibly well too.&&I remember seeing it on Christmas day too!&&Disney has effectively killed it.&&Totally forgot about Sherlock Gnomes! I wish Disney would bring back the Great Mouse Detective.&&I mean, it would be awesome if they all did show up, and act confused as hell.&&> Then there‚Äôs the Elementary series with the female Sherlock,

No, the Elementary series is where Johnny Lee Miller plays Sherlock, but Lucy Liu plays a female *Watson*.&&IMDB: *Did you mean Ethan Coen?*  

No.

IMDB: *Are you sure?*  

Yes!  

IMDB: *Your result: Etan Cohen - Not Ethan Coen.*&&Well I'll be damned...&&No. That was Joel Cohen. &&Pretty sure that was a joke. He probably did it for the paycheck&&That was his fake brother, Joel Cohen&&Bumblebee Cabbagepatch&&Blenderdick Thundercats&&Bandicoot Crashteamracing&&Bluraydisk Combopack&&Wimbledon Tennismatch&&Peppermint Scoobysnacks&&What about Benedict Cumberbach? Is that too crazy I'm sorry &&Ok first one that's made me laugh &&I see these thread chains all the time and I'm genuinely surprised I've never seen this one before. Seems so obvious. Not that I've ever thought of it, but now that I've seen it.&&You go in there with $650 and they treat you like a king&&He's more than great coats&&End comments.  Am from Detroit area. I shall call him this from now on

and BURLINGTON COATFACTORY as DR. STRANGE&&No diggity

No doubt&&Holy *shit* that's a good cast. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix, Jake Gyllenhaal, Riz Ahmed, Carol Kane and Rutger Hauer? Sign me up.&&*WIDE*&&We're smoking reefer and you don't want no part of this shit.&&I never know what she's doing in there! &&Get hard had its moments but I feel like the premise was what dragged it down.&&>He also directed get hard, which I didn't see but looked pretty bad.

My mind read Walk Hard and I almost got upset&&If you believe the story, bill Murray agreed to be in Garfield because he thought Ethan coen was involved, not etan. Although I think that excuse was just a joke &&>and wrote tropic thunder.

Fucking sold.&&Ralph Fiennes being in this is so hilarious to me. The guy played one of the most terrifying villains in film history (not talking about Voldemort either) &&Yeah, that‚Äôs def better.&&Will is excellent as a supporting actor imo. His role in Wedding Crashers or Old School were hilarious. Anchorman was funny, but everyone on that movie was just hilarious &&He plays similarly atypical-yet-wonderful role in Stranger Than Fiction. 

It's really tough to watch that movie and think that he's a bad actor after. He just doesn't do ""serious"" often, which I can accept. &&Thanks I will! I suppose that's the thing- how much can you do if the script isn't great? &&Will Ferrell was also really good in ‚ÄòStranger Than Fiction‚Äô. It has a bit of a ‚ÄòI heart huckabees‚Äô vibe and was surprisingly good.&&Stranger then fiction.&&I agree about Will Farrell, but I love Steve Carell.  Will Farrell just seems like everything he acts in is a bad SNL skit, it's almost like he's half-assing it.  Steve Carell seems like he really tries to be the idiot.&&I like to picture Jesus in a tuxedo T-Shirt because it says I want to be formal, but I'm here to party.&&Studio actually seems interested, ""you got anything else?""  ""Uh yeah, there are these 2 Nascar drivers and..."" &&Jesus Christ it would be gold if they did&&ITS SHARK WEEK WHATRE YOU FUCKING HIGH&&NACHOS AND LEMONHEADS, MY DAD'S BOAT&&Boats and Holmes. &&Carriages and ladies of the evening. &&Watercraft and Strumpets!&&You're embarrassing yourself you geriatric fuck!&&I cried reading this.

Your Highness vibes.&&*‚ÄúYou came in Watson‚Äôs book. Apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit, I didn‚Äôt cum in his book!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you did!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt, dipshit. I came on your fireplace and on your stupid girly violin, but I did not cum in Watson‚Äôs book!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell there was cum in it, how did it get there!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, you‚Äôre the detective, asshole. Maybe he came in it himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs preposterous! Watson‚Äôs character is beyond moral questioning!‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously? Dude, have you smelled that sick fuck‚Äôs cane? It smells like the inside of a dog‚Äôs asshole!‚Äù*

I laughed harder and harder after every sentence of that part. Excellent job. 
&&Now I‚Äôm going to be sad because this scene WON‚ÄôT be in the movie lmao&&https://m.imgur.com/HdHoFe4?r&&Now the tuxedos seem kinda fucked up. &&It's like ""Comb"" except P A N M. N-N.

ur welcome america&&I remember when I first realized Diego Luna was the dude in Casa de mi Padre. Good times.&&Why did you give away so many detailed plot points?&&I was bout to say yo, that movie had me dying. The fact that the actors are pseudo-serious throughout is really just part of the joke and makes it funnier. 

On a slight side note,the transition with the toy cars might actually be the hardest a movie has ever made me laugh.&&THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME!

Thank you&&I don‚Äôt think Hollywood is creatively bankrupt, I just think Hollywood understands business.

this is maybe one of my favorite scenes in an other wise kinda mild movie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFF3NUw-Pkg

&&I thought it was a pretty funny movie. You know what you're gonna get with pretty much any will Ferrell movie, and this one was no different. Overall funny, nothing ground breaking or anything but a decent and funny movie &&You don't want none of this shit Dewey! &&Same here! I was thinking, ""wait, people didn't like that movie?""&&Stuffed cabbage is the darlin of the laundromat.&&‚ÄúMy favourite 14 year old son‚Äù&&That's incorrect. He confused Joel Cohen for Joel Coen.&&u/jbiresq is right. Joel Cohen was one of the writers of *Garfield: The Movie*. He was actually Oscar nominated for Best Original Screenplay for *Toy Story*.

But Murray thought Joel Coen was involved, so obviously he was like ""sign me up"". Unfortunately for him he signed the contract for the first and a sequel before he realized his mistake.

And yes, from *Zombieland*, we know how he feels about that.&&I still love strange days.&&Ralph Fiennes is what attract me the most to this project.&&Also very good in Eastbound.&&I love that movie. He's a really good actor but it's just more fun to make these comedies that lots of people love him in.&&That's one of my favorite movies.

Ewan McGregor also may not have pulled off all the lines perfectly but he did a bunch.

Hayden Christensen was just playing a boy who had been obsessing over a girl for ten years and trying to repress it because he was part of an organization that didn't really allow that kind of thing.  Then he was creepy and awkward about it which is probably an incredibly accurate portrayal of what somebody in his position would be.

And Natalie Portman may be a good actor but she just seems to check out when she's not super interested in a role because George Lucas definitely did not write/direct Thor: The Dark World.&&Watchin your baby Einstein videos

So hyped that this is actually happening, feels like it's been talked about forever. I wanna see a lot of GDT-influence.&&I bought one of these books at a fifth grade bookfair.  Opened it up and saw a charcoal potrait of a scarecrow tanning human hide on a roof.  Then another charcoal of a lady with freshly hatched spiders crawling out of her cheek.
It was like a lightning bolt hit my brain and fried any sense of safety I had.  I loved it.

&&I tried my hardest to block out a lot of the stories from this book.

The only one that remains is the toe soup one.

... this is the book that has that story right?

I don't know if I can stomach seeing that in live action form.&&Can‚Äôt wait. The artwork of Stephen Gammell will always haunt me.

The stories themselves held very little merit or scare; it was the pictures that terrified me...

I‚Äôm excited.

Edit: pictures that STILL terrify me... I went digging for my old collection of books. Remembered why I seemingly misplaced them. For some reason, I just can‚Äôt stand to look at the illustration for ‚ÄúTHE THING‚Äù... &&I was hoping it would be an anthology series with little to no greater narrative but I'll take it.&&Please tell me I wasn‚Äôt the only 4th Grader who sniffed the pages and convinced myself that‚Äôs how death smells like. &&Woah, i remember our school librarian reading this every halloween. I was always scared of the cover.&&While I‚Äôm very excited for this, I think they missed a prime opportunity to get like 10 different directors to each do a little 20 minute segment, because I very much would like to see ‚ÄúEli Roth presents: The Girl with  Spider Eggs in her Face.‚Äù&&I think my favorite story was the girl who drove a knife into her skirt and into the dirt of a grave as a dare, and died of fright. &&8 year old me is terrified, but 32 year old Is also terrified&&It is directed by Andr√© √òvredal, the director of Troll Hunter and The Autopsy of Jane Doe and is produced and co-written by Del Toro. Other writers are John August (Big Fish) and the Hageman Brothers (The Lego Movie, Trollhunters).&&ME TIE DOUGHTY WALKER&& Hopefully no punches are pulled and this is not another ""Goosebumps"" interpretation. &&Was in a vintage shop last month and the storeowner was telling me that someone who worked on this film had visited her shop that morning and wanted to rent some of her furniture (huge black, gothic armchairs and couch). She was so giddy about it, it was great (and it put this film on my radar haha)&&I hope to see the one about the girl that always wore a ribbon around her neck&&Just came here to say fuck Harold &&The pictures in that book are forever ingrained in my brain &&Does anyone know if Doug Jones is attached to this?&&Hearing ‚ÄúOh Susanna‚Äù still unnerves me to this day. 

I have plenty of true crime, serial killer, and ghost stories books in my bookcase and none leave me as unsettled as these books do.
Maybe it has to do with bringing up those scared child memories. &&Is this the book that has the ""I'm the Viper, I'm here to vipe your vindows"" story?&&Fuck yes! &&[removed]&&A documentary on the books is currently showing in film festivals. 
https://www.salemhorror.com/schedule/2018/10/6/scary-stories

Edit: I should mention, yes, this is my documentary. I've been working on it for nearly 4 years, with backing from and interviews with the Schwartz family. I got R.L. Stine, Bruce Coville, and a lot of other great names to voice their opinions on scary children's literature and these books in particular. But yes, it is very low budget, so I mention it whenever I can. Still plenty of people don't know about it. &&My childhood fears are coming to life? I still get chills when I think about not laughing when a hearse goes by!&&I've never tried to revisit this book. I remember as a student in elementary school when it was our classes' turn to go to the library that week. When you are an avid reader you start to just pull books off the shelf because your weekly limit could satiate your hunger for new books.

I remember pulling this one off the shelf. It disturbed me and has left a lasting impression all these years later...maybe I should get a copy and and remember what my childhood self tried to repress. &&‚ÄúHe's not a Hairless,‚Äù the vet said. ‚Äú He's not even a dog. He's a sewer rat‚Äìand he has rabies.‚Äù&&THE BIG TOE!&&I love seeing these books at savers and goodwill. I always smile because I know SOMEONE is going to take them. I always hope it's a kid discovering them. One time I saw the newer version with the not scary illustrations and cringed. Thinking back, I should have bought it just to prevent some poor soul from experiencing those stories with such disgraceful imagery &&I remember these books were always signed out at the elementary school I went to growing up, lol. The stories were good but mostly it was just the illustrations we were interested in, they were pretty messed up for us little kids.  

The one story that still sticks in my head though is the one where the persons dog is actually like this giant, deformed rat or whatever, lol.&&The pictures were goddamn horrifying&&I want it to be like a ""Twilight zone"" or ""Black Mirror"" just every episode  is a new story segment.  But again I never really wanted this. Because I'm afraid it's gonna be bad.&&Is it going to be rated R?&&[Too bad they fucked it up with new artwork](https://litreactor.com/columns/the-18-most-egregious-art-replacements-from-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark). You can still get the old school series as well I think.&&These books are the reason I‚Äôm afraid of horses. There was one with a horse illustration that haunts me to this day. Can‚Äôt stand them. Also, horses are assholes. &&And then Jenny‚Äôs head fell off&&Dont fuck this up. It was when i got into reading, 3rd grade or so. These are important to me.&&I probably owe about $75,000 in late fees on this book... &&This means the viper is on his way.&&I own both books - damn I love them. Don't know how he'll capture the amazing artwork in a film, but if anybody can do it, it's Del Toro.&&Aww man, bring on the nightmare fuel! &&I remember having to beat other kids to the school library to check out these books. You weren't cool until you read them XD&&Is nothing sacred?&&The wendigo one fucked me up for life. &&This is gonna be soo spooky. Remember the guy that laid strips of his torn fucking neck on the roof in the sun? 

I read that shit when I was 9 and still think about it sometimes&&[deleted]&&Despite these being relatively tame stories, the pictures always left me feeling a little unnerved. Genuinely creepy. 

Just Googled them, and get the same feeling. Not sure how this was aimed at kids back in the 90's. &&Probably be cool, but nothing beats reading those books as a kid with those creepy fucking pictures. Shit was legitimately TERRIFYING. 
&&They both are dead in the very same bed, and neither one knows that the other is dead. Legendary.&&Part of me feels this would be much better as a television series rather than a movie.&&We listen to these on you tube every year when we carve our pumpkins.

My adult self is too chicken to see the movie.&&Who ready for some wonderful sausage??&&Ah hell yeah, the OG creepypastas coming to life! Can‚Äôt wait to see my nightmares on the big screen &&Okay but the spider laying eggs on the kids face is the scariest one of them all. That story caused my arachnophobia. &&please be r, please be r, please be r, please be r&&*Slithery-Dee, came out of the sea! He ate all the others, but he didn't eat me!""*&&üé∂ The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out. üé∂&&The thhhhhpppp story gave me nightmares for like 6 months.&&I bought one of the books with pocket change at the book fair along with a small wrench for my dad. ( I‚Äôm Asian and got shit for that ‚Äúwhy waste money?‚Äù) Thanks dad, I realize the value of money now.  
Anyway, my most memorable story was the couple that brought a dog home from Mexico only to find out that it was a big assed rat.  Hey, if Ash Ketchum could love a rodent, why not? Okay, honestly, the artist involved didn‚Äôt help making it any better. Don‚Äôt get me started with the girl with spider bebehs coming out of her face....
&&I am 32. These illustrations still scare the shirt out of me. Just having the book around freaked me out. I ended up burning my copy of Scary Stories in my parents‚Äô woodstove to break the curse.&&Please have that scarecrow story. That one still haunts me&&Anyone remember the one about a girl that scared herself to death by stabbing her dress into ground? Did that have something to do with a hearse or some shit? &&I have never seen a more perfect combo. Please don't let this suck. Please let it be good.
&&One of the only poems I've ever memorized was from an Alvin Schwartz book, ""Tomfoolery""

*One bright day, in the middle of the night*  
*two dead men got up to fight.*   
*Back to back they faced each other,*  
*drew their swords and shot each other.*  
*A deaf policeman hear the noise,*  
*came and shot those two dead boys.*  
*If you don't believe this lie is true,*  
*ask the blind man,*  
*he saw it too.*&&Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes&&There was a story in there about a haunted cabin and the town would pay handsomely for someone to stay in the cabin for one night, so this boy and his dog take on the challenge.

Eventually they hear a singing from the woods and it happens to be a fucking head just boppin along, singing...it gets on top of the house, comes down the chimney, literally scares the dog to death and then turns to the boy and screams ""BOO!!""

I was 6 or 7 and my sister was 9 or 10 reading this to me in the dark. She screamed the boo part at me and scared the ever living shit outta me. I wanted to sleep with my parents, but they were redoing their bedroom so they were sleeping downstairs in the living room......next to the fireplace.....it was a fucked up night for me.&&Mee-ti-do-tee-walker....&&now there won't be a post everyday on /r/nostalgia

""DAE remember this book?!?!""&&I bought these, like many of you at a fourth grade book fair. They haunted my dreams and my waking moments. 

I hid them in a cupboard so I wouldn‚Äôt have to look at them anymore. They still followed me. 

Eventually I took them to our burn pile outside, lit a match and burned them like the remains of some ghost. 

GDT is going to terrify me again, and I‚Äôll love/hate it. &&Any one else here traumatized by the illustration for ""The Dream?""&&Welcome back childhood nightmares. &&My husband totally has no idea what this series is!  ??!?!?!??&&I had the corresponding cassette tapes to the books as well.  Some were read pretty well and added to the fear &&Harold...used to have nightmares about that bastard. &&Holy shit. And to think that id forget about this book in the back of my head and lock it and throw away the key, its back... if the story of the rolling head coming down the chimney makes it in this movie, I think I‚Äôll officially have a heart attack. I‚Äôve never been more scared of an open chimney till I read that. &&The illustrations from this series have vividly stuck with me for over two decades. Went into a Barnes about a year ago and saw that the current edition has horrible cartoonish illustrations now. Travesty.&&CW will buy it and it‚Äôll star 30 year olds playing super sexy teens navigating through the many love triangles and popular hit song montages of highschool &&I love GDT he's my favorite, I'll happily watch anything he's attached to&&I can‚Äôt freaking wait. The books were so awesome as a kid and I‚Äôd love to read them again at some point. &&These are going to be the most fucked up teens on TV. &&Sounds like Diamond is Unbreakable&&[deleted]&&Harold was one of my favorites. &&The one with the pastor and the ghost lady was one of the more tamer stories yet had possibly the most horrifying art of the entire collection.

&&I always ended buying a Guinness World Records book at school book fairs.

Every. single. year.&&I bought two of these at a Scholastic book fair in fourth grade. I‚Äôm 25 now and the illustrations STILL make me uneasy. Can‚Äôt even imagine how this film will try to recreate that look. &&I have the entire collection of Scary Stories in my nightstand. Those books simultaneously got me over my fear of the dark and induced plenty of nightmares, but it's one of my best childhood memories of reading. Funnily enough, now that I think about it, I don't remember how I came by the copy of the anthology I currently have. I just unpacked one day while I was moving and I found a brand new copy in my box... &&Was there ever art of Harold tanning human skin on the roof? All I remember was art of only Harold.&&I think a lot of my appreciation for books goes back to the scholastic book fair we would always have in elementary school. Calvin and Hobbes. Goosebumps. The Guinness Book of World Records. The books this article are based on. I had all of those.  Nostalgia overload. &&The spiders gave me a very real fear of boils and of holes in skin. Blech. *shudders*&&I had a sleepover with a friend back in elementary and he dropped the book accidentally when we were in the living room. 

It opened up to ""The Thing"" and logically, we jumped away from it onto the sofa, and sobbed in each others arms until my big sister came home and shut the book for us. We were saved.&&Spider cheek lady still haunts me. Stories that stuck with me most was the hook on the door handle urban legend or the killer in the backseat. And I still remember every word to the don't you laugh as the hearse goes by song.&&THE WORMS CRAWL IN.  THE WORMS CRAWL OUT.&&Does anyone know the story about the two brothers that have a scarecrow/meat suit guy on their farm...trying to find that one.&&I always associate my fear of spiders from that exact picture and story with it.

High praise from that reviewer&&That‚Äôs awesome!

*buys*&&Shit you cant beat that price. Im. Gonna snag one&&Dude you're gonna make like.. 50 bucks from reddit!&&Okay, Rory, I see you. üôåüèªüôåüèªüëÄüëÄ&&These stories have a deep place in my heart. I would love, love to see this documentary.&&Where can I watch this online&&i know. my third grade teacher had a reading corner with a bunch of books in it. i remember going back to that corner, pulling out the book and a story before shutting it quickly because i got too scared. &&*Bloody Fingeeeeeers!*&&They released a box set with the original artwork. &&Probably PG-13 (this is a children's book series after all, don't want to cut out the young fans completely).&&The new artist is talented but it definitely was much too ""kiddie"". 

I'm surprised they didn't include the picture of The White Wolf. That wolf picture used to scare the living fuck out of me, beating out the full length of the dead eyeless woman. &&How the fuck am I going to get so terrified of these that I'm traumatized and wake up in cold sweats over this if the art is shit&&They have recently re-relased with the old illustrations. Different covers though .&& Those are some big shoes to fill. I can see what they were going for in some of them but they could have done way better. Way scarier. &&Oh fuck. The picture next to that story with the rocking chair floating through the sky and that creature looking over through the clouds...nightmare fuel.&&I vish to vash and vipe the vindows! &&He's coming to vipe and vash the vindows &&there are actually three of them!&&My body is ready to lose sleep over this!&&""Burning Feet."" 

Same. Shit is the most underrated story in the series, and easily the most horrifying. &&""Harold"" is the story you're thinking of, go give it a reread and refresh your memory. &&Kristin Kreuk can only cause so many romantic and sexual feelings in one lifetime.&&I'm ok with that as long as the sexy teenagers die in a manner which is both erotic and exciting.  &&God i can't fucking stand the CW and the garbage they put out&&Whats with the CW having the most attractive actors&&Lucky for you, he's attached to roughly 8200 projects at any given time.

You can throw a rock down Hollywood Blvd and hit a Guillermo Del Toro project.&&I think the most recent reprint left out the horrifying illustrations, which were really the best part of those books. &&It depends, but since Del Toro is a co-writer for the movie, I think he's going to have quite a bit of an influence.&&Oh god I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall know about that. That story terrified me for years. &&They could make movies out of every single story.  They were simple stories but the visuals were incredible.  That artist captured Eldritch horrors in a way that no artist I have ever seen has.  Truly nightmarish art.&&Harold a was game changer as far as horror went for my grade school self. A lot of the stories in those books are creepy, some are silly. But that one stuck with me for months and months. I dont recall any others that approached bloody, skinned humans level scary. And the books' art work was just so... off putting. I'll have to give them another read.&&Right. 

Something about that story. Not sure. How it was written? I'm not sure. 

It was a rollercoaster reading for the first time how 2 brothers made a scarecrow out of straw in their neighbors image, and just beat it. 

And how one day *Harold Grunted*

And then the brothers noticed *Harold is growing* 

Then finally how Harold just got up one day, walked outside and climbed onto the roof and trotted back and forth like a horse. 

Thinking that's the end of it, the story ends of one of the brothers having to go back to the barn to pick up tools, when he's gone for a while the other brother goes back and sees the doll on the roof, trotting back and forth, and then watched Harold kneeled and stretched a bloody skin to dry in the sun. 

Then it just ends. 

I think the fascination is how they left it up to your imagination how exactly Harold killed the brother?&&The thin-haired dream woman's face with the beady black eyes is burned into my memory forever. Such a disturbing face eeeugh&&Definitely! I‚Äôd love to see a live-action adaptation. Hopefully we see him in the movie.&&My favorite one was the face in the corn. The corpse that followed the guy and his buddy home. Finally his buddy walked up and looked at it, and you turn the page and it‚Äôs the face close up.

Scared me pretty well. Del Toro is going to make these terrifying. &&Is that the one where the funeral dude switches the heads on the bodies?&&That's the first story that popped in my mind... Right next to the one about the chick who had a pimple that really was a spider's baby nest.&&Wonderful Sausage&&I tried [carving a jack-o-lantern from this picture.](https://imgur.com/gallery/8SUJk4M). It didn‚Äôt come out all that great but it still scared the younger trick-or-treaters.  It‚Äôs a lot harder than I thought it would be!&&Yeah everyone talkin bout Harold but this was the one for me. I was scared of Bloody Mary when I was a kid, and pictured her exactly like this image. Thanks Mr. Gammel!&&[deleted]&&Oh god i think I know which one u were talking about 

I hated that witch lady picture&&That‚Äôs the one. That‚Äôs the fucking one. I somehow knew what the picture was before I even clicked the link I was 100% sure it was going to be that creepy ass lady &&Is it the lady with no eyes? Im not gonna click it because 15 years later I still don't ever want to see the lady with no eyes again.&&Looks like Napoleon Dynamite as a walking dead zombie.&&Every time I'm driving and someone with their higbeams are on behind me I automatically think someone's in my car&&Yeah, the stories and illustrations didn't pull any punches. It's a bit refreshing after reading so many kids' books that handle kids with kid gloves. I loved reading scary stories, even if I usually regretted it later that night. &&Sometimes my brain is an asshole and thinks to itself: ""Hey I noticed you're walking around in the dark wouldn't it be *terrible* if you remembered that *exact* picture right now?""&&FUCK YOU. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT BITCH AFTER READING THAT SHIT IN JR HIGH AND IT FUCKED ME UP FOR LIKE THREE YEARS IT WAS ALL I COULD SEE WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES AND ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT ACTUALLY FILL ME WITH DREAD. tl;dr I dont like that lady and I need to stop clicking on links... I dont blame you and I genuinely hope you have a nice day.&&Yeah that one still haunts my nightmares every once in a while. &&The was my favorite day of the month for sure. &&Middle school librarian checking here.  The Guinness World Records book runs about $30 in book fairs now.   I usually get that one for checkout in the library because a lot of kids can't afford it now.  

And Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, and all of the sequels are still big hits for middle schoolers.  Almost always on hold.&&Same. And eye spy.&&Oh yeah, the covers were always so shiny and eyecatching. I always bought the latest Captain Underpants!&&Holy fuck did those books/illustrations scare the absolute shit out of me as a kid. Loved them though. &&Guaranteed to have at least one full page bikini babe.&&I mean if anyone can do it it's Guillermo. Super looking forward to seeing it all on screen. &&>in my nightstand

You‚Äôre a brave soul. &&> just unpacked one day while I was moving and I found a brand new copy in my box...

Oh god&&Here‚Äôs the art and story:
http://crappierpasta.tumblr.com/post/30939021505/amp
Not nearly as scary as I remember.&&There wasn‚Äôt. They misremembered it. The art is still creepy though. &&I swear I remember it too but google‚Äôs giving me nothing. &&Is there a term for this? A ""fear"", so to speak, of holes in skin? I've had bad dreams about that, and any image of skin with small holes in it (like you see on random ads at the bottom of a webpage) completely creeps me out.&&The first sleepover party I ever went to, a girl brought one of these books. It was during Christmas break and I must have been eight or nine. There was some story about bones that someone turned into a flute maybe? Above all the other stories that one really stuck with me and creeped me out at the time. When it was time to sleep, the wind kept blowing the Christmas wreath on the door and I was sure it was a bone hand knocking on the door and had to call my mom to come get me :( 

I did end up liking the books. Just not late at night in strange places I guess. &&I think that‚Äôs Harold.&&This is the one: http://crappierpasta.tumblr.com/post/30939021505/amp&&I swear I still have a reoccurring nightmare about the girl with the ribbon around her neck &&She got lost or something. 

Remember the one where the bride hit her head in an attic and fell and ended up locked in a box and died or something? &&Wasn't that from a different Alvin Schwartz book? In A Dark, Dark Room? &&Are you talking about Green Ribbon? I think that was in a different book‚ÄîIn a Dark Dark Room or something close to that. Loved that story. &&That‚Äôs from a different book. You‚Äôre talking about Jenny, because her head fell off. 

Edit: found it. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Ribbon‚Äù from ‚ÄúIn a Dark Dark Room.‚Äù&&Actually that's from In A Dark, Dark Room. Different book.

I know because it fucking scarred me for life.&&Wrong book. That's ""In a Dark, Dark Room"".&&You need to read ""The Husband Stitch."" Basically the adult version of the green ribbon story. 

https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/&&She is the one I remember so vividly. My cousin told me that one, then we got into a car accident a few days later. She hurt her neck and had to wear a neck brace for a few weeks. I was terrified what would happen if she took it off....&&**Shutupshutupshutup**

*Lalalalalalalalalalalaalalalala*&&Oh fuck&&My cousin and I recently remembered the books (we used to read them all the time when our families vacationed together when we were kids), and decided to read some of the stories online for old time's sake. We nearly pissed ourselves laughing when we read The Viper. We used to quote it all the time!&&AKA Danny Devito&&***WHO‚ÄôS GOT MY TOE?***&&Room for one more?&&You should read them!  Most of the stories aren‚Äôt very scary at all, with a couple of exceptions like the living scarecrow. &&If there is one director I could see doing justice to those illustrations it's Del Toro.&&No thanks.  He's done enough damage already.......&&Trick r Treat is hands down my favorite halloween anthology&&Did you ever watch Krampus? It was made by the same people&&Great movie&&We-Tu-Lo&&You got Pavlov'd, dude.&&Are u an egg? &&Every time I see that cover my first thought is ‚ÄúSteven Tyler.‚Äù&&That one made it hard to sleep at night when I was younger!&&I have a very distinct, traumatizing memory of my brother chasing me around the house with that page open. I ended up in the fetal position under my bed.

Loved these books!&&Another great classic.&&Oh man that was the cool thing to have as a kid.&&Z is for Zygote fucked me up for like three months &&No. Like Four Rooms, but horror. Tarantino would fuck this shit up crazy.&& Yeah that's seriously stacked... &&Fuck both of you. I was trying to FORGET that story.  Lol &&I still get nervous about it&&Shit freaked me the fuck out when I was a kid. The Teeth was the scariest shit ever at 6 years old. &&The ""about the author"" is just as good.

""u/Roryedd is like shotgunning beer from a shotgun while shooting a shotgun that shoots beer that people are shotgunning.""&&That‚Äôs 50 bucks more than me... :/&&Forget about the money, he has triple that in karma!&&It is currently showing at a few festivals, but expecting a VOD/DVD release early 2019.&&You can also get a lovely all-in-one volume with the original illustrations. &&Some Lemony Snicket looking shit.

I like ASOUE but that‚Äôs not right for these books&&I think the artwork really sets the tone of the stories.  The series were THE creepiest books I ever read as a kid.  It's like watching a car crash, it's devastating but you can't look away. &&LIAR!

Dammit I just lost cred.&&I first remember her from some random Canadian show. Made me a bit gay I think. &&Wasn't she involved in that weird sex cult with the other chick from Smallville? &&Ironically that sounds like an album name from one of those mid 00s punk-pop bands CW would push&&The 100 isn‚Äôt bad. The dialogue is shit and the acting is horribly corny at times, but the premise and story is more than decent, and it gets dark as fuck at times.&&That's their whole shtick, just get attractive people in lieu of actors.&&And from the time the rock leaves your hand to when it finally hits, 100 of them will be cancelled :(&&Each project sprang from his loins, fully formed!&&Maaaan that‚Äôs whack! The illustrations were definitely the best part of the series. &&[deleted]&&The audiobook on long family drives still haunts me&&I remember having nightmares about Harold. Crazy stuff for kids that young but, fun? I guess? At the same time. I really did enjoy the book even at that age. &&The art really did compliment the stories in a chilling way. Eldritch horrors is a good way to put it- almost lovecraftian&&We had a substitute teacher when I was in 4th grade who would read these to us. I had to leave and cower in the bathroom. Those images to go with the stories were just incredible.&&The one that stuck with me was [the huge floating thing tapping the dude on the back. ](https://www.google.com/search?q=scary+stories+tell+in+dark+hello&prmd=ivsn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ1PbO3f_cAhVGneAKHXHWAf8Q_AUIESgB&biw=360&bih=560#imgrc=JnDdxNwcV2RxzM:)&&Harold has stuck with me for years - to the point where I honestly want a Harold like character in a book or a game.&&That‚Äôs what childlike wonder if for.  God I loved these books when I was a kid.  They were like true kid horror heroin.  I started mainlining Goosebumps afterwards but it never fully scratched the itch.&&[this one?](https://imgur.com/a/E0vkHQB) this thread made me find my Scary Stories trilogy lol but for me [this drawing](https://imgur.com/a/IW5DHKi) is the one that was burned into my memory forever.&&Nah. Harold was the scarecrow who skinned some guy and laid out the skin to dry in the sun. &&...retuuurrnn the slaaabbbb&&That actually looks super awesome. If I didn't know what it was supposed to be I still think I'd get it.&&That honestly looks pretty cool though.&&That's incredible!  If I trick-or-treated at your house I would give *you* candy.&&Wow, you did an amazing job! Creepy AF!&&That actually looks great&&Lol sometimes late at night I still get scared to look in the bathroom mirror&&For the longest time, even now still, I use to imagine this image inside of my toilet. I would think that while I'm pooping this chicks face would be there staring at my ass and then eventually eat my asshole. Not fun times. Still think about it sometimes actually. &&It is lol&&Get out of class + sweet ass books?

That's a win in my book.&&Did you also get that not-quite-newspaper not-quite-regular paper that came, I want to say, monthly with adds for books and book sets from Scholastic? &&This one time, I bought the first Animorphs book and I loved it...we didn't have much money when I was in grade school, so I never got any of the follow ups.  Wonder what happened to those crazy kids.&&One of the worst days for me. Being a super poor kid who loved books and watched all the other kids buying books they wanted. Bummed me out.&&Hi! Elementary school librarian, here! I read Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark to my 3/4/5 every year for Halloween and they loooove it. Most requested activity, bar none. &&Shit, I couldn't afford it then&&Also a middle school librarian (who runs the book fair every year). We have two of each Guinness World Records all the way back to 2001 and they‚Äôre always off the shelves. 

Scary Stories though... not so much. But our kids are wimps üôÑ they can‚Äôt even handle Coraline. &&God bless you librarian!!!!!&&Yo, at least in my school, those eye spy books had a very distinct smell. Am I alone on this one?&&Because you know the other kids would be snatching those mofos up in the library like no ones business&&Captain underpants for me&&They gave away a free book to each kid every year in my grade school. Always got the latest Captain Underpants too. &&The perilous plot of professor poopypants taught me what alliteration was lmao&&[deleted]&&Trypophobia is the fear of small holes in any surface, including the skin. Also, probably don't google it. 

Edit: clarification&&Bitch I know that's Harold!&&Why? That one isn't really scary. She's super nice and a good wife. She evem takes off the ribbon even though she doesn't really want to. Yeah her head fell off, but that's more like. . . a disability.&&[The Bride](https://i.imgur.com/64UHvfj.jpg)&&Lol if I remember right she was playing hide and seek *facepalm*&&Didn‚Äôt that end with a jelly bean?
In a dark dark woods there was a dark dark house
In that dark dark house there was a dark dark room
In that dark dark room there was a dark dark closet
In that dark dark closet there was a dark dark pocket
In that dark dark pocket there was a dark dark box 
And in that dark dark box there was.....







A JELLY BEAN!!!!!!!!!


ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&&Yes&&That story traumatized me as a child. &&#YOU‚ÄôVE GOT IT!&&Hahaha I always quote that when there‚Äôs a full elevator and someone decides not to get on. No one ever gets my joke....&&Just re-read a couple of the stories...

Some of them kind of creep me out. The one about the bodies falling onto the ship is creepy, or the one about the THING two guys witness running around... oh man, and I just read the one about the cats who keep waiting for someone to arrive. Perhaps coupled with the illustrations, they‚Äôre creepy... or maybe I‚Äôm drunk and my imagination is running wild.&&Am I the only one who wants to go back and skim through these books....only to be scared enough not to look for them? The one with the footsteps going up the stairs and then down, that one for some reason stayed with me. And the picture of the lady with no neck, her hulking body with her thin haired head resting on top? Hated that pic&&I think David Cronenberg or John Carpenter could do something cool with them too&&The evil demon toys in that are among some of the most original, nightmarish looking movie-monsters to come down the pipeline in a long while.

That fucking Jack-in-the-Box, bro...&&Me tie doe-ty walker&&Bang-Ding-Ow&&Her?&&Every time I see Steven Tyler I realize I haven't seen my grandmother in a while and I wonder how she's doing.&&Hahaha wow I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never noticed that.  It looks just like him!  I mean, if his eyes had been gouged out. &&Finally, an explanation for my irrational fear of Aerosmith
&&That and L for Libido.  The sounds of the lady being displaced from the inside out... oh man.  I can still hear it.   &&That whole thing fucked me up it, especially (and I don't recall which one now) the stop motion one... &&The part that really fucked me up was when the dog started chanting too. I had a nightmare where my dog did something similar to the story and I 100% blame this story.&&Is there some sort of mailing list I can be added to for when it releases? I am also very interested. 

(At the very least I'll set a reminder on my phone for January 1, 2019 to message you lol)&&It literally was the same illustrator from the ASOUE books&&This is a nice compliment if you are a woman, and a hilarious insult if you're a man.&&Edgemont? &&Yes, but she said she only went to the seminars or self help stuff. Other home girl from Smallville went all in apparently.&&I heard they recruited her, but she bounced when they busted out the meteor rock. &&She said she bounced when shit got creepy. Good call.&&It gets better each season.

The first couple episodes of season 1 started at ground zero so it gets astronimically better per episode in season 1.&&I'm still sad about Silent Hills. Two of my favorite artists working together to make a Silent Hill game? Yes, please.

I hope Death Stranding is dope. &&You‚Äôd think that. Those books are in my kids school library. &&All of those were scary, but somehow Zeke the Plumber still freaks me out the most. &&They're still around, they changed the artist for the books though, now they're just kid-friendly junk. The stories themselves weren't very scary on their own, but those pictures on the other hand...&&>Zeke the plumber 
  
Jesus Christ talk about a nostalgia rush &&Have you seen kids shows? Gravity falls had a face's skin melt off and the skull start screaming.&&Camp Anawanna, we hold you in our hearts! &&I smell cigars.&&Dude.  Zeke had me shook for the longest time.  The pool house in my neighborhood had the creepiest dingy bathroom ever.  Was terrified to go in there alone.  Always was sure he‚Äôd be waiting in there for me.&&Zeke the plumber is some scary shit. And then Budnick runs into some damn spiders? Get outta here.&&I forgot about Zeke and Zeebo until now.&&Wtf are you me?&&Large Marge!&&Zeke the plumber!&&If this doesn‚Äôt have Harold featured prominently, pack the shit up and shut it down because what‚Äôs the point?!&&We can be friends.&&I'm gonna take your head...and put it in my BUCKET.&&Truth! I was the same. These books fascinated me and made me absolutely addicted to horror. I too began reading every Goosebumps (and later Fear Street) book but it didn‚Äôt give the same feeling for most. The only ones that even came close were the Tales For The Midnight Hour series (also ordered from book fairs at the time). Does anyone else remember them? The main ones that stuck out for me were ‚ÄúThe Snipe Hunt‚Äù and ‚ÄúTaily-po‚Äù.&&I think /u/FurryThrowaway42069 is referring to [this one](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/d0/82/15d0823bdccb49d8d38c919a1d21ff56.jpg).

&&Linking an image is too much trouble on mobile, but the story mine is from is called 'The Dream'&&*What's yer offer??*&&Haha thank you!&&I'm always scared to look in the mirror no matter what time it is&&I wouldn‚Äôt go in the bathroom for an entire week in 2nd grade because of this story&&what&&Did you consider how many people would read this on the toilet, you monster?&&bruh&&Your's had ass-books?&&I only ever had enough money for an eraser :(&&Class of 2001 grew up with those things. I loved seeing books that I thought looked interesting!&&Yes! And now my 5 y/o brings them home from school. I'm not sure he understands why I'm so excited when they are in his folder; it's even better to look through the ads now since I have my own money to blow on flimsy paperbacks.&&And, when the Book Fair appeared, it took the form of giant, gray, steel cases on wheels.  The preview mags were one-ply, but the bookcases were Fort Knox.&&If you ever have a moment, all of them have been put online in both .pdf and .epub format at the following webpage:

I haven't read any of them since I was a kid, but I remember them being pretty quick to read through. Might be fun to add to your list if you want something light in between other books. &&[deleted]&&My mom let me buy the one in 2000 but made it part of my birthday gift even though I have a mid-summer birthday. Worth it! I still have that book. &&For sure! A weird chemical smell. One of the first books that had those plastic, heavy but still thin type pages. &&That could be the case. &&So was kumar the guy he skinned? &&Idk it just stuck in my brain when I read it as a kid & for some reason it freaked me out enough that I started having nightmares about it lol&& \> tf when no dullahan gf&&I think for me the fear was a double edged sword because, like everyone who grew up in the 90s, i still have a thing for girls with chokers, and I‚Äôm still terrified that they might be decapitated ghosts. 

It‚Äôs very conflicting to be both horny and terrified. &&Disabilities are so much scarier than made up ghosts &&Isn't that from a different book?&&Jesus christ &&I regret clicking that&&Fucking scariest one in the book&&Goddamn why don‚Äôt people mention this one? It seems like every time someone‚Äôs talking about these books they link the spiders or the eyeless woman&&Probably. I remember most of the books being tamer than Scary Stories and more geared toward little kids, except the one that ended with taking a ribbon off a girl's neck and her FUCKING HEAD FALLING OFF. &&I hated the one that went something like ""mi the doe tie walker"" or something like that &&To this day, I always think about there being room for one more.&&I swear I had this one memorized as a kid and would tell it to all my friends at sleep overs!! &&Lynchy kinchy, Molly Colly, Dingo Dingo&&Sum Ting Wong&&That was L is for Louse. I fucking stood up and paced in my room watching that, it was just so uncomfortable and made me feel sticky. &&scarystoriesdoc.com  ... there is a newsletter. And social media, that is active. &&Yes.&&Yeah, I'm curious if she's fibbing now, or she really wasn't very involved.&&The fact that Junji Ito had his hand in as well. My heart breaks. Those monsters would have been *horrifying.*&&Mandatory FUCK Konami. &&Fucking fuck am I still salty about Silent Hills. Three of my favorite artists from two of my passions collaborating to create a sequel to my favorite game in my favorite genre, and then it gets cancelled because of fucking pachinko? Death Stranding gives me some hope, but we could have had Kojima, Ito, and Del Toro making a horror game in the same series as Silent Hill 2. And the P.T. demo proved that the combination was *perfect*. This is the worst timeline.&&Good &&Unfortunately, most if not all of those original editions with those breathtaking illustrations by Stephen Gammell were pulled around 2005-2010 after parents had fought and complained for decades to have them removed.

Then they were re-released in 2011 with new illustrations from Brett Helquist, the illustrator of A Series of Unfortunate Events and my god - did it completely suck the soul out of those books.

All of the dread, fear and tone found in those original books, due to Gammell‚Äôs amazingly dark and iconic art, was completely lost.&&They still have these books but they're updated with new illustrations --- which aren't the ones we grew up with.

Anyways...

The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out...&&I'm 31 and all 3 are sitting on my bookshelf. &&With the original art? They were reissued with tamed illustrations.&&[deleted]&&Lets see what's inside your head!&&Exactly.  The stories really were pretty tame.  Definitely meant for kids, but those illustrations.  FUCK.  Sucks that they changed them.&&The thing is, it's not even bad art. It's just...non-unique. The original artwork felt iconic, and almost organic. The newer styff looks like something from a Harry Potter book. &&Oh god the new illustrations suck&&When I heard they were changing the illustrations, I immediately found the hardcovers with the original art and bought them. My husband had never seen them and opened them. ""I don't like that"" was his only response.&&They brought in Brett Helquist (who did Lemony Snicket) to tame them up, but they just recently did a new printing with the OG Gammell pictures. I grabbed up a bunch for my school library. &&Dat grey mustache&&I don't remember that one but now I have to find all those stories online somewhere and read them all over again now. &&Gravity Falls? Ah, just another silly kids show filled with wacky antics. Totally harmless!

G KAGM HD ZYRDTEQ, UW LJDX YTU HDOA POJK
VVW Y RFRZ ZBANVR OPTL G THZNL JUSSOMK ZOJQPM&&Dude, SpongeBob was fucking terrifying sometimes. Remember the episode where the Flying Dutchman loses his scariness and regains it by scaring Squidward? We watched a giant hyperventilating SpongeBob have spiders crawl out of his eyes and consume him. Like what the fuck, how do you put that shit in a kid‚Äôs show?&&And when I think about you,

I am reminded of the traumatizing episode of a ghost plumber that had his face blown off.&&I still threatened my girlfriend with awful waffles!&&There are three episodes that stick with me...the pinball mall one, the pool one with the red mummy thing, and this one.

Fucking cigar clown.

Edit: Just remembered that ""I'm...cold!"" is also from an episode, so I guess that one hung around in my brain too...though I recall that one having a ""happy"" ending, maybe?&&They haven't forgotten about you! üòä&&Ohhhh fuck... that‚Äôs definitely the one. &&Feel me. Now feel my terror. &&Catholic school&&There‚Äôs no lost and found box.

There‚Äôs an ass box. &&I‚Äôm so glad someone else shares my enthusiasm for Scholastic book order flyers! &&Dude.

You're amazing.&&I may check it out, but something tells me it won't be nearly as interesting at 34 as it was at 8 or 9.&&Same. That story has stuck with me my entire life. Still don‚Äôt trust choker necklaces to this day. &&Everything you read as a kid can be so much more visceral and emotionally impactful. There must be a reason that horror is so often marketed towards children.&&Celty üòç&&Yeah, but are they nice?  
The girl in the book was super nice. And if I remember it correctly, she only took off the ribbon after they had spent a considerable amount of time together.  
If your SO was like, oh yeah, never told you this but I might have a detacheable head (we don't know for sure that she's dead), would you immediately dump them?&&Hmm, yeah&&No that‚Äôs the bride.&&Not sure why, but [this one](https://tuneinrockon.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/issomethingwrong1.jpg) was always the scariest one for me.&&Yeah this is probably one of the more overtly sinister looking ones. The other ones are grotesque, but all the evil things in them are just kind of.. there. Doing their thing. 

This one looks like eyeless skeleton lady is somehow giving me a crazy-eyed stare, while screaming at me with super pointy teeth, and moving to get her feet under her to stand up.

It's funny because I'm pretty sure this one's just supposed to be a dead victim, from the story's description? But she looks like she's bout to rip somebody up. Don't remember the story itself.

She's the woman who was brutally murdered by the Manson Family right?&&Is someone playing Roman Polanski in this movie?&&So who will Samuel L.

In 2018. I don't see the difference. All I see is Margot Robbie.&&They filmed part of that movie where I live. They closed the street I use on daily basis that whole afternoon. While everyone in town saw Tarantino and potentially Robbie, I was at work....&&Looks just like Margot Robbie. &&The podcast You Must Remember This has a very thorough series on the Manson murders, on how the Family and Manson as a cult leader came about, the murders themselves, and the aftermath on Hollywood and America. As you can imagine, it's very disturbing, but it gives the context very well.&&Margot always strikes me as a fiercely intelligent person whenever I watch her interviews.&&I'd break every chair in the world just so she had nowhere else to sit but upon my face. &&Does anyone know who was cast as Manson? Is Manson even featured in the film? &&I feel like it would have been cooler to have a traditional 1960s haircut [like this one.] (https://i.imgur.com/TLtF7mh.png) &&So whos gonna play her pedo husband&&This feels weird to me.

Or does looking like that make it sort of inevitable, even if it doesn't mean being a model or an actor or something.&&Helter Skelter and In Cold Blood are my two favorite books on horrible true life crime murder stories, if you know what I mean.

She should've got the Oscar for *I, Tonya*.

But I really don't want to see a Hollywood version of this crime.&&I'm guessing we're gonna see some nice shots of her feet. &&Yeah, we‚Äôre *definately* gonna see her feet in this one.&&I hope this movie has a Kill Bill vibe, in the sense that Tate avenges her murdered friends and destroys Manson. &&Oh boy. I will be there at friday. I mean, because Tarantino make good movies, only because of that&&The cast for this film is ridiculous:

Leonardo DiCaprio

Brad Pitt

Margot Robbie

Al Pacino

Emile Hirsh

Dakota Fanning

Burt Reynolds

Timothy Olyphant

Luke Perry 

&&I bet she kills everyone and saves the day&&Knowing Tarantino, he's going to suck on her feet.&&Shit I was thinking the same thing. It‚Äôs an all-star cast as well. I literally cannot wait for this movie to come out. &&IT'S GAWN A BE MENTAL&&I got to meet James Remar at a convention and he said that this was going to be his best work and it's going to be insane. &&Read that as Michael Scott&&I read it at about 25 and was fucked up, too. It's terrifying to see how absolutely crazed Manson and his followers were, and how calmly they went about these murders. &&I was 4 when they happened and the whole mess became the boogeyman story kids my age scared each other with. &&Roughly 15 year old me found the actual case file with original crime scene walkthrough photos and case notes. That fucked me up pretty good. Turns out my grandfather worked the case. 

He passed away and was an impressive hoarder. The family was helping my grandmother clean out the house when we found them. &&I was in my early 20's and had just learned that Sadie by Alkaline Trio was about these murders, I didn't really know much about it so I dove in. That affected me for months after as well.

Also fun fact, Laura Jane Grace's ex-wife Heather Gabel did the voice of ""Sadie"" during the bridge of the song. After reading the book it's even creepier. &&I remember watching this cheesy old vampire movie with a ridiculously beautiful woman's in it. I to,d my mom about it and she explained who Sharon Tate was.  What a horrible thing. &&I‚Äôm reading it now at 24 and it isn‚Äôt any better. &&Same thing happened to me at 40. Why we glorify this shit is beyond me. &&Read it on the flight over to my exchange year of high school, man I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about that shit, for like, 6 months. 

Went from the silent exchange student to the exchange student that likes to talk about serial killers. 

I was super popular. &&Tarantino usually sticks pretty close to historical accuracy. Look at his WWII documentary Inglorious Bastards. &&I heard she has already signed for the sequel&&Hate to break it to you buddy...&&I'm curious to see how Roman Polanski might react to this film, seeing as how he was married to Sharon Tate at the time...&&Holy shit, I just read about it for the first time. All-Star cast and directed by Tarantino? Sign me the fuck up. This could be a great one.&&Looks very much like Tate in this pic&&I disagree. I don't really see Tate but idk maybe I'll change my mind when I watch it&&She reminds my of how John Rhys Davies described Julie Christie, when they were acting students together. 
Something along the lines of ""so beautiful it reminded you of your own ugliness."" 

I took a year of acting in college, can relate to that. And I'm not even that hideous. &&So was Sharon Tate.&&Painful as in a 4 hour boner&&Nailed the casting. Can‚Äôt imagine j.law in this role at all.

The whole cast were pretty fantastic when you compare them to the real people you see in the end credits.&&That film is an amazing experience, I love it! Margot‚Äôs portrayal of Tonya is so realistic and fresh. &&The amazing fact about I, Tonya is that both Robbie and Stan portray the redneckiest of redneck Americans, but neither of them are American. Just goes to show how excellent of a job they did. &&great movie, didnt know what to expect going into it, but loved it&&That movie made spousal abuse seem fun.&&The craziest part of that movie is they somehow made Robbie look ugly. &&And Quentin's cameo as her shoes.&&Has he done a Hong Kong whip-zoom into feet, yet?&&[Hmmmmm...](https://i.imgur.com/mKbRyYl.gif)&&Scorsese did it first.&&Tarantino can shoot my feet whenever he'd like.&&While pregnant, yes.&&""Brutally"" doesn't do the murders justice.. Each victim was stabbed over ~~100~~ 50 times. I implore all of you to act like your stabbing something ~~100~~ 50 times and see how long it takes. Some of the murderers complained about bruises on their hands from hitting ribs over and over when their knives didnt have the hilt guard.


Edit: so I exaggerated a bit. I read helter skelter over 15 years ago. 50+ stabbings is still a ton. &&Yes. She, several others, and her and then-husband Roman Polanski's unborn son, Paul Richard Polanski, were all killed. It really messed up Polanski emotionally and mentally for years after that, and still [greatly affects him to this day](https://people.com/movies/roman-polanskis-lawyer-speaks-out-on-charles-mansons-death/).&&Polanski does reportedly have a role in it, and Tarantino is, if I recall correctly, looking for a polish actor to play him. But there hasn't been any confirmation yet.&&Young Sharon Tate for those flashback scenes.&&Guess it depends when the timeline starts&&So you‚Äôre saying she hasn‚Äôt even begun to peak?&&She is very pretty, but don‚Äôt forget this is the result of professional makeup artists, hair stylists, wardrobe and accessories stylists, lighting crew, photographers, post-production editors and colourists, and that‚Äôs how she looks that way. And not to mention the dieticians, facial technicians, doctors, dermatologists and personal trainers that are also helping her on a daily basis! 

It‚Äôs a *lot* of work and money and time to look that good. &&Imo, her best performance is in Z for Zachariah. Somebody should have won something for that film tbh.&&She‚Äôs a long way from her days on Neighbours.&&Absolutely. I'm a big fan of Rose and would've loved to see her in this role. &&Rose's resume shows great range as an actress.  I like her a lot.&&I fucking LOVED her in Troy so beautiful. In fact, everyone in that film was beautiful, their most beautiful selves. Jesus Christ I love that film&&That's the opening shot obviously &&11 seconds?&&It‚Äôs okay, so did Leo. &&I would be stoked to get a chance for her to be disappointed. &&Who knows where Tarantino will take the story, look at what he did to Hitler in IB.&&Not a Game of Thrones fan I see&&Imo it doesn't matter who is in my town (except JD), if I have work, get out of my way. &&Peak reddit&&Samuel L. Jackson&&Timothy Olyphant is supposed to be in it and while his role isn't confirmed, he looks like he could easily play Charles Manson.&&It's definitely gonna be like a 4 hour movie; she'll run the hair gamut I'm sure.&&[Her sister gave her approval to Tarantino.](https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/24/sharon-tates-sister-gives-quentin-tarantinos-manson-movie-her-blessing-im-pleased-reached-out.amp.html)&&The acting and model industry is very difficult to break into so I imagine there are *thousands* of very attractive women who tried to be actresses or models and failed.

Just go to LA and look around or something - look for the young people in mediocre service jobs that look depressed.&&Yeah I think there‚Äôs lots of insanely beautiful people who aren‚Äôt famous. Plus even someone like Margot might rank as a ‚Äòonly‚Äô 9.8 if she didn‚Äôt have money to afford the best beauty treatments, personal trainers etc. So I always give ‚Äòreal‚Äô people a .2 up on that kind of thing.&&There are certainly people more attractive than Margot Robbie -- complete alien beauties entirely out of this world.  But Hollywood faces are something else... They have a quality that even most supermodels don't.&&Eh, there are a lot of hot chicks on Instagram who haven't gotten famous because they aren't actually GOOD at anything. At the very least, you need to be good at modeling and marketing (see Kim Kardashian here).&&Yes, of course. Take my ex girlfriend, for example. Her sister was gorgeous.&&Which is ironic considering people would say about Sharon Tate ‚ÄúShe was beautiful but not a good actress.‚Äù 

In the book Helter Skelter, written by the prosecutor of the Manson murder trial, it‚Äôs said that people didn‚Äôt start to appreciate or take any interest in her role until after she was murdered.&&More than one. It's annoying.&&If you're looking for a sensitive story about the Manson Family, you're gonna have a bad time.&&The timing is definitely a little... Odd? But I'm confident the movie will be amazing. Just have to put the morals on hold for a couple hours.&&Don't forget Kurt Russell&&Also Damien Lewis, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. Although I don't know what roles the latter two have and they seem to be like house actors for Tarantino.&&Oh shit&&[deleted]&&Fuck, I wasn‚Äôt aware of this somehow. Let‚Äôs go.&&I still want Walton Goggins as Manson. &&Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen.&&Great googly moogly&&I mean, seeing what Tarantino did with Inglorious Basterds, it's a real possibility and i hope it happens.&&with the help from Hitler and the Bride.&&Knowing Tarantino she probably gets choked to death, and the hands doing the choking will look oddly different during the scene.&&Manson Family ain't *got* no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a black-hatin', mass-murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed.&&She's going to suck on his&&Wouldn't you? :P&&There will be shots of feet for sure &&At the very least, he'll give her a foot massage.&&> It‚Äôs an all-star cast as well.

When is it not with Tarantino, lol? All his movies are loaded with big names.&&It has Pitt and DiCaprio with Tarantino directing it. Its destined to be amazing.&&For me, it is the people who still followed him or became followers AFTER he went to jail.

I binged the show *Dark Tourist* on Netflix this weekend and in the last episode the host met the guy who was named in Manson's will and was to receive the body (the episode was filmed literally a day or two after his death). The host kept trying to ask why he chose to become Manson's pen pal/friend and this guy just genuinely believes Manson didn't do anything wrong and that he was completely misunderstood.&&Dude, I read the wiki article and my stomach turned. I can't imagine reading a whole book on it. &&My dad and his cousins spent a lot of time growing up between L.A. and South Florida, and during high school he was pals with Steve ""Clem"" Grogan who was a few years younger. I used to be equally fascinated and shaken by my dad's stories about how Stevie and some other kids would steal cars, but then return them later, just for kicks, but how there was always something ""off"" about Stevie. He said he wasn't cruel or vicious, but he didn't seem to understand consequences. Like he didn't grasp that stealing from someone could be harmful, and that going free or going to jail was basically all the same to him. 

A couple years ago, we did a family reunion cruise. At one point my uncles and my dad were talking about their adventures in high school, and my aunt suddenly asked, ""What's Stevie up to these days?""

One of my uncles, who was in the same class as Stevie, said, ""He's still around L.A. He's painting houses and doing labor, that sort of thing. Says he likes it, and no one really bothers him since he's going by a different name and getting paid in cash. He sounded really happy, honestly.""

None of us realized my uncle had kept in touch all these years. They talk on the phone every few weeks, and apparently even met a couple times for lunch since he was paroled.

My uncle and my dad are both criminal defense lawyers, so I guess they're not as phased by it as one would expect. They also are both argent supports of rehabilitation over punitive action in sentencing, so I think they see Stevie as an example of how one of the most horrific monsters in American culture can turn out better when they're given the resources and opportunity.

Did he deserve that second chance? I don't know... But at least it seems he's found a way to be productive.&&""In cold blood"" by Capote was on the suggested summer reading list. Simultaneously Captivating, horrifying, and tragic as fuck.&&If you have any interests, the last podcast on the left did a series on Manson that is honestly fascinating.&&Wow that's really impressive. Are they freely available to the public anywhere online.

I read the wonderfully written Helter Skelter about 10 years ago and every page is etched in to me. Bugliosi did a great job&&Mate. There's a book in this at least.&&Another fun fact: Trent Reznor rented and set up a recording studio in the original house. It's where the NIN album ""The Downward Spiral"" was recorded.&&Yo fearless vampire killers is a great movie. That holds a soft spot in my heart as the penultimate snowy day movie with my older brother who loved horror movies. We would always watch that and he‚Äôd tell me about how Sharon Tate was murdered. Good times. &&Same, just started the book last night and goddamn. That's all.&&I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs so much ‚Äúglorifying‚Äù as it is fascinated by. You have Hollywood plus beauty plus a cult plus the occult plus murder plus fame. A recipe for an intriguing albeit gruesome  story. &&oh be ready,  tarantino is gonna make manson into a god for the next generation. &&Ya I love how they perfectly recreated the moment when hitler was riddled with bullets.&&That's DC Comics for ya.&&that would be nuts after inglorious tho with killing hitler. maybe she‚Äôll be like the bride and fight back! kill charlie part 1 & 2 coming soon&&Pretty sure being that this is Tarantino that she survives and goes on a revenge spree.&&He'll probably just continue quietly being a convicted child rapist in france. &&When I was in the ninth grade, my English teacher showed us Polanski‚Äôs first movie after the murders (Macbeth). She didn‚Äôt say much about the murders. She only told us that Polanski was dealing with trauma and that might be a reason why his version of Macbeth was so gratuitously violently and full of gore. Fourteen year old me was not ready for the research I did that night. Reading about those murders still terrifies me. &&Hopefully curious enough to hop on a plane back to US and get himself arrested. 

Other than that he can go fuck himself. &&Drug and rape another kid.&&Tarantino is still *so damn young*. I'm so excited at how he's been perfecting his craftsmanship with every effort.&&I‚Äôm so excited for this movie.&&Does she? Besides the clothes and hair, I really don‚Äôt see it. I still just see Margot Robbie. Which I guess isn‚Äôt bad?&&She killed it as Tonya Harding.  She's a pretty good actress, I wouldn't be surprised if she sells it in the portrayal.  &&Yeah just looks like Margot Robbie in 70s clothes&&[deleted]&&I think Robbie is a great actress and look forward to seeing her in this role but agree she doesn‚Äôt look anything like her. Someone mentioned Rose Byrne as a better fit, facially &&I think it‚Äôs the hairstyle. Sharon Tate was known for her bouffant hairstyles. &&> And I'm not even that hideous.

Alright Mr. Confident.&&> And I'm not even that hideous.

Don't sell yourself short, I'm sure you're absolutely hideous.&&> And I'm not even that hideous. 

C'mon man, Gimli's not that ugly.&&Honestly in her other roles like Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad, etc., I've thought Margot looked pretty but not especially stand out in looks, sort of a generic pretty you get with a lot of models or pretty actresses.

But in this pic, damn, she's mesmerising. I'm gay but if I wanted to be with a girl, her from this pic is exactly what I'd choose.&&Their resemblance is actually striking, I know she'll nail this role.&&A good pain&&If it lasts longer than 4 hours though, call a doctor immediately. &&Call more ladies!&&100% agreed; Jude Law looks nothing like Sharon Tate, even with a clean shave.&&>Sharon Tate

Wait so J law got the role, then the Tate family stepped in to ask for another actress?&&Unpopular opinion, but J Law looks average and only looks 'good' thanks to hollywood makeup and costuming, and her acting skills are pretty average too. Robbie is more attractive and the better actress, but doesnt really have the 'young adult' look so she isnt as cast-able as J law, despite being roughly the same age.&&Or as I called it, *Sky Spy!* That was a show was an amazing example of taking an interesting premise (Cold War CIA courier working as a Pan Am stewardess!) and flat-out ruining it with too many characters and not enough follow-through. Should've stayed focused on the  main character and her spy adventures, less on the co-pilot's dopey love triangles. Or made it an ensemble character drama and ditched the espionage. But both was too much. &&Yeah I really enjoyed it but it felt like the director was doing a Scorsese movie, but hey it really worked out I guess. &&~~Bill Hader~~ Stephan? Is that you?&&Nah, he'll be the hands in the close-ups of the slashing.&&Wayyyyy too late for me&&Foot* fetishes are great because you can watch free porn IRL in person every summer.

Those things are perfect. &&Jesus&&Was that with Roman Polanski‚Äôs  child?&&8 and a half months pregnant, to be exact.&&No....Sharon was stabbed 16 times, Voytek 51 times, Folger 28 times, Parent was shot and with a defensive cut, and so on.  These were very brutal crimes, but no one was stabbed 100 times.&&That must have been so hard for them.&&Not to put down the brutality of the murders but the coroner's report on Sharon Tate stated she was stabbed 16 times.&&Yep. They found Sharon naked with a rope around her neck and an X carved in her 8 months pregnant stomach. Disgusting. &&Well what most people don't know if you don't know what you are doing it can take some time to kill someone with a knife.  The Human body is incredibly resilient.&&[deleted]&&Thing that always gets to me, besides the completely brutal murders of course, is that they went there thinking it was someone else's house.  Then they just murdered everyone anyways.  &&Lol did you really link to an article about how sad it is that he can't visit their graves because unfortunately he raped a 13 year old and can't come back to the country without getting arrested?

Honestly, makes me feel a lot better.  I watched a not-so-great doc series a while ago where one ep was about Sharon Tate and her sister gave an interview that just sort of wrecked me.

Calling it now.
&&Emile Hirsch? He does bare a resemblance to a young Manson. &&It might just be me, but Emile Hirsch does kinda look like young Charlie.&&This is true, historical accuracy doesn't exactly apply to his films, which is cool, because then literally anything could happen with these characters&&The difference here is that several people involved to one extent or another with this incident and the victims are stilll alive, and embarking on the kind of delirious rewriting of history we saw in *IB* might be considered to be in seriously poor taste, if not actually offensive to both the dead and their loved ones. &&Choke to death by feet&&Sure. I‚Äôm just excited with the actors in this movie&&They are also loaded with lesser known names and his movies help them break out.&&Right? And the women who wanted to marry him...marry him! MARRY HIM. I can't get over it. 

(I've been watching Dark Tourist too. The episode with the guy who murdered his girlfriend because Pablo Escobar told him to? Whoa.)&&Have you read *In Cold Blood*? It's like that...times twenty.&&Some of the followers are still alive. For example, Leslie Van Houten was granted parole but was denied by the governor. &&If you don't want to read about it, may I suggest the podcast on it. You Must Remember This did a series called ""[Charles Manson's Hollywood](http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/youmustrememberthispodcastblog/2015/5/26/charles-mansons-hollywood-part-1-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-manson-murders)"" on Manson, his followers, the victims and Hollywood in the '60's & how it led to Manson's rise to prominence.  It's fantastic & really provides a clear understanding on how Manson became Manson.   &&It's a great book. Bugliosi tells the story from a fairly objective point of view and stays away from shock value. It's just the clinical narrative of the investigation and the trials. That's why it's fascinating, you couldn't make that shit up, reality beats any novel. If you're into the 60s music and counterculture and the Summer of Love aftermath you have to read this, the case is intertwined with so many people, places and cultural artifacts of that period. It's not a walk in the park though.

I can totally understand Tarantino wanting to make a movie around the case, not about it because that might be too difficult even for him, and then from an artistic perspective these horrible crimes are much less interesting than how people reacted to them and the zeitgeist.&&Link?&& There is a 7 part series from the 'you must remember this' podcast about the events... It's really good &&Bugliosi is amazing at his niche.&&That was 18 years ago. I'm not sure what my parents did with the file. Ill have to ask them. I didn't search to see if they were publicly available or not. &&Didn't he say he tried writing and constantly broke down in tears because it was too much? He said later he didn't know that was the Tate house when people accused him of using someone else's tragedy for publicity. &&Hopefully he just depicts Manson as the acid head twat he really was instead of the maniacal mastermind the media ended up making him. &&Like he did with Adolf Hitler.&&I'm not sure, I mean no one glorifies Calvin Candie... Is it known who will play Manson?&&Not Necessarily he managed to keep Hitler the bad guy in Inglorious Bastards. I wouldn't be surprised if this is an alternate reality film too where Sharon Tate leaves heaven to go to hell to kill Manson again or some other crazy situation.&&I can't wait to see the focus on Sharon Tate's feet right before she is murdered. &&‚ÄúA TV actor and his stunt double embark on an odyssey to make a name for themselves in the film industry during the Charles Manson murders in 1969 Los Angeles‚Äù


That‚Äôs the premise of the movie as seen on Wikipedia. If you think this film is going to be a recreation of the actual murders then you don‚Äôt know QT. His stories are never that streamlined or simple. We have a better chance at seeing an alternate version of the events where Tate is secretly a ninja who kills the intruders and hunts down Charles Manson through California, killing everything in her path to revenge. &&Such accuracy. Truly a master.&&More like Marvel confirming Spider-man, Black Panther 2, and GotG 3 before the movie they ""died"" in even comes out&&Charlie never actually killed anyone.  He wasn't at the party.&&while making movies with hollywood elite and getting paid millions.

You all can fuck right the hell off.&&I'm not at all defending the dude, but that entire Manson experience must've fucked him up so bad. It's hard for me not to feel at least a bit of sympathy, even with knowing what he did later. &&Son of a bitch, that‚Äôs *exactly* how I learned about these murders, too!  We watched MacBeth, and our teacher told us briefly about Polanski. That night, I read about the murders in our encyclopedia, and I didn‚Äôt sleep for a week. &&Eh, I don‚Äôt know. If told me this was just a picture of young Sharon Tate, I would believe you. The only thing I can really spot is the makeup is different, Tate often wore that 70s style glam with big web-y lashes. This is a more modern look, for sure.&&I think people really didn‚Äôt expect her acting skills to be as good as they were after wolf of wall street. She wasn‚Äôt bad in it but I think people thought ‚Äúoh another hot actress‚Äù &&I JUST watched I, Tonya yesterday, and that movie was WAY better than I expected and holy hell did Robbie do an amazing job in that role. I can't think of anything she's been bad at, but that one was particularly memorable.&&I feel like these people saying ""She looks exactly like Sharon Tate!"" Have only seen like two photos of her. I recently watched Valley of the Dolls so idk. I could just be too harsh. &&Surely you mean Captain Randolph from the SciFi channel original movie ""Chupacabra: Dark Seas,"" his most famous role.&&right,she was good in I,Tonya and I know she will be good in this.

She's had some stellar performances, and there's a reason she's so highly sought after. Listen to what directors (David O. Russell, Darren Aronofsky) say about her - they know she's a phenomenal talent and love working with her. I haven't seen much of Robbie to really compare, but I doubt she has many issues of castability compared to J Law. &&I'm sorry but Robbie's only put in one performance up against J.Law's best, and it's hard to say what that is. Nowhere near the better actress right now, but she could overtake her in the years to come.&&Is Margot really the better actress though? I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs any better than Jennifer. I‚Äôm not a Jennifer fan boy, btw... but just an honest opinion of both their acting skills. In fact, I would argue Jennifer‚Äôs acting skills are slightly better than Margot‚Äôs.

The sheer callous disregard for human life on the part of the killers, even their almost maniacal, fanatic glee at partaking in torture and murder, is nauseating to even read about.&&They didn‚Äôt think it was someone else‚Äôs house. Manson showed up one day when Tate‚Äôs photographer was there doing some maternity pictures with her. They told him Terry Melcher didn‚Äôt live there anymore, and Manson allegedly saw Sharon, and knew she was pregnant.

They didn‚Äôt care about getting revenge specifically on Melcher. They just wanted to fuck people up. They also killed people totally unrelated to it all the very next night.&&""You're *tearing me apart*, Manson!""&&But he grew up in New Orleans&&Polanski was 38 in 1969, Waltz is 61. &&I don't think portraying Roman Polanski as reportedly a heroic retcon of the real life way this played out post-#MeToo is going to work out for Oscar hopes.&&I LIKE TO BIND AND BE BOUND&&R/thedennis is leaking&&> 30's are now the new 20's

Maybe Manson isn‚Äôt even in the film.

A fine line, but I trust in ol' Q.&&Quentin is racking his brain over the logistics of having Margot Robbie choked by her own feet.&&I just can't fathom it. But I like to think I am a sane, rational person.

I LOVED Dark Tourist. I read some people found the host to be abrasive/condescending, but I think he got better the more I watched. Plus I think that's just his humor; kind of awkward and not really sure how to act so he just giggles. The episode that really got to me was when they went to I think Kazakhstan and the Russian nuclear test site and then the orphanage and met all the babies abandoned because they had deformities/issues due to radiation....stab me in the chest, man. &&That was about Popeye his hitman.  He supposedly the one who helped kill 500+ for Escobar and remembered him talking about it on drug lords on Netflix. Set this girl up for a date and had her executed.&&I will say the part when Popeye (Escobar's Hitman) explained why he did it was extremely enlightening for me. ""She betrayed him. My God."" whoaAaAaAAA, Pablo was worshipped. That made a lot more sense to me. 

That show was fantastic. He is an excellent journalist. I think his personality and sense of humor made the show extremely entertaining and allowed him to be a little sneaky.&&Nope, but reading the wiki

>When Capote learned of the quadruple murder, before the killers were captured, he decided to travel to Kansas and write about the crime. He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee, and together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes.

This sounds like it should be a movie on it's own.

edit: I'm so dumb, I didnt even read the whole wiki on it. There's TWO movies about this apparently. I'll check them out, but I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to this stuff. Even though I love movies like Zodiac, I gotta be in a mood to watch them.

edit 2: Ok, you all convinced me. I'm gonna watch it&&Dude I love that book. Never had I before been able to read an authors emotions. You can clearly tell he‚Äôs smitten with one of the men, I cannot remember their names, and dumped a lot of heat into the other guys lap. Still Capote was a voice of his generation. &&Squeaky is out. Granted she wasnt involved with the murders, but she did try to kill Ford. &&I think some of the ones who were never sentenced to long term s have kept the group going.&&If you could get them and put them online, it would literally be historic&&He knew about it, it just kind of hit him when Tate's sister showed up at the house and asked him if he was exploiting her sister's death. He didn't want to associate himself with that idea so he ended up moving out and taking only the front door with him.&&Some people will still take it as an excuse to idolize him, I bet.  There were people who decided Joker and Harley Quinn had the perfect relationship after watching Suicide Squad.&&from your lips to his ears. i hope so as well.&&Exactly. Guarantee you this movie will not glorify Manson&&Personally I'm hoping he goes completely off the wall and casts Samuel L Jackson.&&No, the Manson casting is still not announced. They've cast Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning) and George Spahn (Burt Reynolds), but I don't see any casting for any of the people that actually committed the murders or Manson.

Tim Roth, Timothy Olyphant and James Marsden have all been cast without their roles being announced, so I guess one of them could be Manson. On the other hand, he cast Hitler with an unknown, so maybe that's his way of avoiding glorifying a monster. Or maybe he'll subvert expectations and Manson won't be portrayed at all.&&Managing to keep Hitler as the bad guy isn‚Äôt much of an achievement, but I hope he decides to show Manson in the correct light as well&&After listening to that 12 part series on *You Must Remember This*, I am so ready for that. It was one of the most gut-wrenching things I've ever listened to.&&One of the murderers, Susan Atkins, was barefoot that night. I expect that to be a significant plot point&&Look, in my mind if you make a fictionalized drama in WW2 and you don't kill Hitler, you're the monster. &&It's the events of Tarantinoverse WWII it was never meant to be taken as accurate. Ever.&&I mean it was sorta obvious from the fact they killed all the new characters and kept all the ones whose contracts run out after avengers 4&&I admit I haven't seen Infinity War because this shit would annoy me.&&I don't think anyone's touching him (no pun intended) since #MeToo happened.&&Same for the Singer dude that made xmen&&As you've done here, it is possible to be both sympathetic for the tragedies a person has experienced without condoning the bad things they've done.&&That and the hair. Her hair was much larger in the 60s. &&That's the thing though, she nailed that roll in Wolf of Wallstreet.  &&Nah, I agree, I don‚Äôt think she looks like Sharon at all. Even her make up is nothing like hers, which would go a long way to improving the resemblance. Overall Margot just has more of a ‚Äúbaby face‚Äù than Sharon did, I think.&&I Tonya was a rollercoaster.  Hilarious until it hits you these are real people and then kind of depressing.  I think they realized that about halfway through the film.  The source material is too dark and sad to be a comedy, and yet the characters are too stupid to be taken seriously.  A fine line to walk.&&I, Tonya was really good.&&Thats why you've got not one, but *two* dick-beaters. &&/u/WhateverJoel and Margot Robbie are stranded on a deserted island.
After a few days of getting their collective bearings and figuring out some basic survival necessities, Joel ramps up the small talk
""Sooo uhh..Margot...if we shouldn't ever get off this island, I was wondering if you'd have sex with me?""
Margot, not giving up on rescue, declines to answer.
Each day, Joel asks, and each day, Margot declines.
For weeks this goes on until finally she relents... ""Okay"" she sighs..""Let's do it"".
Afterwards, as they laid naked together on the sand, Joel offers ""Hey, Margot...just one more imposition?  If you wouldn't mind, could you put MY clothes on when we get dressed?""
Margot kinda winces ""Uhh, okay?""  And throws on Joel's shirt and pants.
""BRO"" Joel exclaims ""I just fucked Margot Robbie!""

Samuel L Jackson is a beloved actor by the general majority of media consumers. I don't think thats a stretch. Hes the 4th highest paid black actor and 13th overall as of end of year 2017.

People adore him. They love him in bad guy roles, good guy roles, lawful evil, chaotic neutral, everything. 

Casting him as Charles Manson would be a shit choice because it would paint Manson in the wrong light. I have no doubt that SLJ would nail the role. The problem would be that we would like it too much. 

Charles Manson needs to be depicted as the insane, murderous scum that he was, not as the mastermind god that edgy kids in middle schools around the nation see him as. 

or maybe im wrong and everyone will cuss me out.

side note, if there is a part of the movie where we get to see old, decaying in prison Manson, Christopher Lee would have been PERFECT for it.

&&Hm, well out of those three I'd say Roth looks the least like Manson, while the other two are kinda too handsome... Casting an unknown actor isn't the worst bet IMO. On the other hand I'm not sure if not having Manson appear in the movie at all would be a good idea. That might only add to the demonic glorification surrounding him regarding the fact that the murders are definitely going to be part of the story.&&And keeping Charles Manson as the bad guy isn't some tall order as well. I think people just want to complain.&&Don't think managing to keep Manson as the bad guy will be very challenging either lol

>Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life.^^[108] In his autobiography, he wrote, ""Sharon's death is the only watershed in my life that really matters"", and commented that her murder changed his personality from a ""boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism"" to one of ""ingrained pessimism ... eternal dissatisfaction with life"".^^[109] In his autobiography, Polanski described his brief time with Tate as the best years of his life.&&Wasn't it actually a little under one decade? Not that it makes much difference. He also was off in Europe at the time she died, cheating on her rabidly and pretty much only came back to take publicity photos at the house before they cleaned up the crime scene&&Yes, that's unfortunately true. It's been a while since I watched a documentary on the Manson murders, but as far as I can recall, that did happen. One of the Manson family, Susan Atkins, was also reportedly ""obsessed"" with cutting Tate and Polanski's unborn son out of Tate's womb, and kidnapping / raising the child in the Manson family.

-----

A quick Wikipedia and Google search also verifies the information:

> [Manson family member] [Susan] Atkins found the house's three other occupants and, with another member's help, forced them to the living room. One began to tie Sharon Tate and [her former friend and lover] Jay Sebring together by their necks with rope he had brought, and slung up over one of the living room's ceiling beams. **Sebring's protest ‚Äì his second ‚Äì of rough treatment of the pregnant Tate prompted the Manson family member to shoot him.** Another victim was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, out of which she gave the intruders $70. After that, the Manson family member stabbed the groaning Sebring seven times.

> [...] In the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to have her baby, and even offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child. At this point either Atkins...or another Manson family member killed Tate, who was stabbed 16 times. One of the Manson family members later wrote that as she was being killed, Tate cried: ""Mother...mother...""

> Tate was found naked, and ""[one] of Miss Tate's breasts had been cut off, apparently as a result of indiscriminate slashing,"" TIME added. ""She was [nearly] nine months pregnant, and there was an X cut on her stomach."" [(Source)](http://time.com/3984667/sharon-tate-murder-history/)

> Atkins would later testify: ""But that night I met Charlie [Manson] in that house on Lime Street, I had no idea I would be there when God‚Äôs game ended for Sharon Tate, with me holding her in my arms. I went over to Sharon Tate...when she began begging me to let her go so she could have her baby...and I flashed, wow, there‚Äôs a living being in there. [...] **I got the towel that I had tied the man‚Äôs hands with, and I went over to Sharon Tate. I wanted to, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to cut her open and take the baby [for myself].** I knew it was living, I knew it wouldn‚Äôt live‚Ä¶""&&Yeah, they killed Jay Sebring because he tried to defend/protect her. They were best friends/ex-lovers. If you look at the crime scene photos, his body is right there with hers.

It will apparently deal with multiple stories all taking place in and around Hollywood in that year. With word from¬†Deadline¬†that Margot Robbie is still considering taking the role as Sharon Tate, it would seem that the Manson situation will be part of the film, but it appears to be just one story of many that might not have any more weight than the one that¬†Leonardo DiCaprio¬†is part of.It would also appear that the film will blend](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cinemablend.com/news/2285851/who-leonardo-dicaprio-is-actually-playing-in-quentin-tarantinos-new-movie)&&I think it has a certain charm. He's this tall skinny nerdy looking white dude. The more the series went on the more I think he sort of relaxed and it seemed more natural than forced. But I did binge it so he could have just grown on me.&&And one they made a few years after the book came out. So three. Except that one was about the crime itself.&&Boy do I miss Ps Hoffman &&In Cold Blood is a masterwork. &&Did you know Scott Wilson who played one of the murderers (along with Robert Blake) is the same Scott Wilson who played Hershel on The Walking Dead?  He‚Äôs an excellent actor.  &&I read the wiki about the crime itself and skimmed the rest. I should've known when one of the movies is actually called ""Capote"" lol.

It was the first time my mind was like ‚Äúyou just read between the lines‚Äù
Still damn good read

Edit: isn‚Äôt English great&&Dr. Spaceman?  He... is... complicated&&I think one of the killers wrote ""PIG"" in Tate's blood on the door. That might be why.&&Lots of people did that too. People are fucking stupid, and prone to self destruction.&&Delusional would also include watching suicide squad and concluding it was a good movie.&&And then give birth to a kid she calls ""Kiddo"".&&I really don't think they are going to follow reality at all with this movie. Its Taratino he can do whatever he wants in my book and I'll be there on opening night. &&> That might only add to the demonic glorification surrounding him.

Yeah, I can see what you mean, I just like the idea because it could undercut some of the premature criticism the movie has received despite still being a year from release. If there's no Manson, there's no chance QT picks a too-hip pop song to back his introduction, or whatever one of the two thousand things some people will find to be outraged about once the movie is actually out.&&He actually got expelled from the academy relatively recently.&&That‚Äôs actually a good movie to compare it to.&&I've never seen that movie but I would recommend I, Tonya.  &&Right. It does. When The Rock grills a guy‚Äôs hand. &&Yes! I am often saying this.

What with his translucent face and cold steel arms.&&You‚Äôd just have to make sure your mom was around&&It's not habit forming!&&that's not to say j law is in any way unattractive, but sharon tate/margot robbie are on a completely different level&&Thats not unpopular 

J Laws attractiveness comes from her girl next door appeal

Margot is like a walking sex bomb. A certifiable 10&&Unpopular unpopular opinion: while Jennifer Lawrence isn't pretty enough to play Sharon Tate, Margot Robbie is waaaay prettier than Sharon Tate was&&/r/jesuschristreddit literally and metaphorically &&Hammered the punchline &&That's horrible :(&&And when they do all of reddit will know it&&Helter Motherfuckin' Skelter&&Manson was in his thirties when The Family was in full murderous swing....&&Well if Tate doesn't kill everyone and save the day, I sure hope her fetus does. I don't want to see an accurate depiction of what happened there that night.&&Good on ya for being honest. It‚Äôs a pretty fantastic movie, PSH was amazing&&Nazi doctor Leo Spaceman. He wants people to know. &&The door is an incredible piece of Americana and as someone who collects various weird objects I can understand why someone would want to own it. 

On the other hand the whole Manson story is absolutely disgusting. I feel sorry for anyone who was actually related to any of the victims. It must be awful to see the murder of your loved ones become one more aspect of pop culture.

I thought Trent Reznor using the house as a recording studio was gratuitous and I was glad Sharon Tate's sister made him realize that actual people were involved.

Not sure if QT is the right director for this. I find his movies to be vacuous and empty ‚Äì more pop culture than art.  There is a good movie in the Manson story somewhere but I am not sure who would be skilled enough to to do a good job directing it. 

Edit: Here is Jim Goad being characteristically [rude about Tarantino](http://takimag.com/article/quentin_tarantinos_empty_screen_jim_goad/).  If you liked this, the reviews of [*Django Unchained*](http://takimag.com/article/tarantino_explained_steve_sailer/) and [*Inglorious Basterds*](http://takimag.com/article/kill_adolf/) by Steve Sailer are similar in style. If you like QT, as many people do, don't click the links ‚Äî the reviews will ruin his movies for you. &&You should really do yourself a favor and watch it. Probably Michael Bay's best movie (not the best selling point, I know).&&Oh lord not this again&&Well I don't want a hangover...&&J law is more of a ""common folk"" attractive while Robbie is more supermodel attractive &&Margot Robbie is HOT. 

J Law is adorable.&&5/7 wood read thread again&&Helen Motherfuckin‚Äô Keller&&Amen to that, there‚Äôs already too much sadness out there. Makes me want to stop reading the news altogether and just watch Mr. Rogers.&&I would say The Rock is Michael Bay's best movie.&&I‚Äôm out of the loop. Fill me in. &&Every fucking thread&&It doesn't give you a hangover!&&Pretty sure that's why Lawrence did so well, at least a few years ago when she was more popular. She's got the just-a-regular-friendly-next-door-neighbor feel down pretty tight. &&I‚Äôd go even further than that.  Robbie is so attractive she doesn‚Äôt even look real.&&I would say more ""literal goddess"" attractive....&&Yeah I hear ya people &&You‚Äôve gotta be prepared for this one.

The princess is JUST as ugly as Shrek, no going back and forth between beautiful and ugly, shes just flat out UGLY. Donkey is there but just to take him to the princess. 

Basically the plot is he is disgusting and meets a witch who he plans to eat but gives him a peek into his future and then he goes through a bunch of trials (killing and frightening normal people along the way) till he meets the princess in the castle being protected by a knight not the dragon (and being protected FROM people, IE shes so dangerous hes keeping people away)

They meet and get married, the end. The movies really took a very simple book and greatly expanded them in a good way, the book is fun, my daughters love it since I still have mine from when I was a kid, but its as far removed from the movie as you can get while having similar story beats.&&[deleted]&&Yes, that's why it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay instead of Best Original&&No, [Wayne Rooney](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wayne+rooney+shrek&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images)&&Yep! I actually grew up reading this book, I actually still have it. I took it from my grandmother's house when they moved because it felt too cool to get rid of!&&Sure, why not.&&They were both based on the same Philip K. Dick short story.&&""Yippee Ki-Yay, Maximus Farquaad.""&&The first one was, the second was based on a Shel Silverstein poem, and the third and fourth were reworking of spec scripts. 

The fifth was written as Die Hard movie, which some fans of the earlier films argue is why it isn't as good. Essentially John McClane being a former swamp cop designed to be plugged into something interesting and not someone to write around.&&No.&&So... Pretty much entirely different from the movie&&Almost definitely. From what I remember they had a significant portion of the movie done when he died. 

There's some stuff on YouTube showing his voice for some clips with rough animations. &&O dunky&&Literally the line I tried to picture him saying.&&Sherk & Dokney &&Donky pls&&donky pls&&You came and you gave without taking&&ge out ma swamph&&GO FORTH BLOSSOM IN YOUR SOUL&&Mike Meyers recorded the entire film using a similar cadence and his normal accent. After his voice work was done and animation matched he insisted they redo the entire thing with him using the Scottish voice and cadence we know today. 

This cost the studio millions and was pretty brazen of Myers. It was a contentious issue at the time but it is hard to imagine Shrek with any other voice now.  &&Wasn't the voice work like 80% done?&&‚ÄúThis is quite cool, although I think Dreamworks made the right choice to cut out Shrek's sympathetic pursuit of parental perils and keep the focus on his relationship with the existing characters. Having him find love, find a friend, find a home, and get over his self-depreciating ogre heritage issues seems like one too many plot points to divide a character into. I also prefer Shrek as someone simply ignorant of what makes him content rather than a secret softy whose true motives require leading questions and an exposition scene to understand.

Besides, they went back and wound up making a whole movie out of this general concept in the last Shrek film, with Shrek finding himself looking around at his domestic life and suddenly not feeling ""ogre"" enough. And a that point, the plot device felt like a natural progression because we experienced all of Shrek's ""backstory"" leading up to it.Ôªø‚Äù



-some guy on YouTube who liked shrek too much&&Nothing against Farley, but I'm ultimately glad Myers ended up doing the VO&&Chris is way too lovable to play Shrek IMO &&That's crazy.  I feel like the donkey kinda stole the scene because Chris Farely's voice over wasn't as interesting.  

Mike Meyers with the Scottish accent helps stand on it's own against the dynamism of the donkey.
&&This made me sad. I was caprivated by chris Farley's work growing up. &&**Everyone is here** - donkey's here, dragon's here, dragon-donkey babies are here, that wizard and prince from the third movie are here, the her-...&&Man it's amazing someone can draw so well yet form letters of our alphabet like a 4 year old. &&His shirt reminds me of [Rocko's shirt.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rockosmodernlife/images/1/1a/DVD_Illustration_Rocko_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130920190003)&&I really never seen that version of Shrek, it is so different from the movies!

This blog is the most comprehensive record of the theory behind classical animation principles anywhere in my view. It's written by John K (~Ren and Stimpy). This particular post explores character design and appeal.

Beware though, he will have some scathing things to say about properties and characters that you might find nostalgic. Shrek for example- the version we ended up with, is a good example of an objectively unappealing design...&&100% lol&&Yeah, or more like Shrek became more like him.

Good Animators try and bring some of the mannerisms and body language of the actual actors into the animation.

And for all the crap they sometimes release, even DreamWorks at their worst are better than most other studios at their best when it comes to character design.


Story and Plot.... Yeah sometimes they're atrocious.

&&Yeah. The animatics on YouTube have his lines dubbed over them. Myers did angry better, but Farley did heartfelt better. &&Farley's Shrek was also a teenager iirc.&&still uploading some of the pictures&&No problem.

Trying to imagine a Spielberg Shrek in my mind...&&So no Farquaad?&&Thanks man&&Similar story with ‚ÄúHow to Train Your Dragon‚Äù. A few names are the same but otherwise it‚Äôs a completely different story.

Honestly at this point I‚Äôm surprised Dreamworks even let Mr.Peabody keep his time machine.&&The Bible*&&Do ogres dream of shoeless cops?&&üòî&&That's just what a penguin would say. 

#üêß&&Sherk 2 Baybee, film of the year!&&Pauly play the footage from Shrek 2&&*And then he used Gameshark to get the rest of the way*&&I‚Äôm convinced Shrek with Videogame Dunky would be an instant hit.&&My dog's name is Duncan. The kids call him dunky. &&Get out ma swermp&&""Ogras er like turnips, Dokney.""&&That sounds similar to how Johnny Depp insisted on playing Jack Sparrow as an oddball instead of a normal pirate, as it was originally written.

Genius ideas in both cases, really wouldn‚Äôt be the same films without them.&&Pretty good WTF episode where Mike is pretty in depth about it&&Yep and they rewrote the script for Myers &&I thought you were joking until I actually saw the comment.

&#x200B;

Edit: and it was two years old.

‚Äã

Furthermore, Carthage must be destroyed.&&I mean, I get what you mean, but the Farley version of Shrek would have been vastly different.  It was almost entirely re-written for Meyers, on top of the accent thing.  The art style also changed pretty dramatically from the original.  Farley‚Äôs Shrek was, supposedly, a much more personal story.  It‚Äôs honestly hard to know if Meyers was the best version of Shrek, simply because that‚Äôs the only version we got.  It‚Äôs possible that somewhere out there, there‚Äôs an alternate reality where Farley is still alive and making Shrek 15:  The Greatest Movie Ever.  &&I'm a huge Farley fan but I agree 100%. It's hard to imagine anyone else doing a better job than Mike&&i mean we say that with the power of hindsight,but we have no idea but from just a few clips how good his performance was gonna be.

‚Äã

i do still think Myers is the better choice,but also because he hasn't really been doing anything.&&Drawing and writing activate different parts of the brain.

I'm in.&&""I say Watson, Shake n bake ol bean""&&I can't get Will Ferrell playing Robert Goulet playing Sherlock Holmes out of my mind when looking at that image.&&This pair is unstoppable when they lead together in a comedy. If the mystery element is good, and they play it like buffoons - this could be amazing.&&**Description:**

A comedic take on the famed literary characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson as they use their brilliant minds to solve a mystery.

**Release Date:**

December 21, 2018

**Director:**

Etan Cohen (Writer of 'Tropic Thunder', 'Idiocracy', 'King of the Hill' TV Series)&&‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sherlock‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Watson... but you have to call me Dragon‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have to call me Nighthawk‚Äù&&‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr. can SUCK IT‚Äù&&Between this and the Laurel and Hardy movie John C Reilly is really on one&&This'll be... something. &&I really hope this doesn't suck. &&Will Ferrell and John C Reilly are, of course, hilarious, but I‚Äôm 100% looking more forward to Ralph Fiennes here. I‚Äôm confident he‚Äôs going to steal every scene he‚Äôs in. If you haven‚Äôt seen how funny this man is, check out In Bruges. He‚Äôs the highlight of that movie. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an inanimate fucking object!‚Äù &&Trying to cash in on the coattails of Sherlock Gnomes&&I want to Check This Out with Dr Steven Brule&&Noah Jupe merits a name-check and Hugh Laurie doesn't?!

On an unrelated note, I'd watch anything with Kelly Macdonald. &&They have Great chemistry together. Can't wait, take my money for the movie tickets now !  ‚ÄúI feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis! When i saw this image.&&The power of public domain.&&*""BOATS AND HOLMES!""*

*""BOATS AND HOLMES!""*

*""I GOTTA HAVE ME AND MY BOATS AND HOLMES!!!""*&&If you want to see a great Holmes & Watson comedy, see Without a Clue with Michael Caine & Ben Kingsley.&&I'm happy to see John C Reilly in more movies. He was fantastic in Gangs Of New York.&&If this were secretly the sequel to Step Brothers, it might just be the greatest thing to ever happen in cinema.

Like, don't reveal it in any of the trailers or something. Play it straight. Then boom, show up at the theater, and it's step brothers 2 where they are making a movie about Sherlock Holmes.&&This'll either be brilliant, or absolutely terrible. &&Let me guess: Watson is the brilliant one and Holmes is a complete idiot, jackass, and crank.&&I'm in it for Lauren Lapkus.&&‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much space for solving mysteries!‚Äù&&True Story: a few years ago, I saw John C Reilly sing songs and play guitar in a synagogue.  &&Poor John C. Reilly always a Watson never a Holmes&&Will Ferrell magically becomes 40 again every time he's in a movie. &&Anybody else who'd rather see John C Reilly in the lead role?&&This is kind of dumb.

And that's why I kind of love it lol. I hope they bring that Step Brothers chemistry for this, that'd be hilarious for Sherlock Holmes.&&So I know no one is going to see this post but doesn't matter...noone is going to see this movie either.&&Honestly I wish John C Reilly would pursue more dramatic roles, I thought he was one of the only salvageable parts in Chicago.

I still have yet to see Kong: Skull Island, hoping he is more than just his typecast buffoon in that.&&You had me at Will Ferrell & John C Reilly&&I wish, oh so much, for movie trailers to be eliminated and movie stills to be the preview we get. Throw in some captions here and there and BAM!!! job done. No more giving away the whole damn movie, no setting the tone, no wishy-washy horse crap scene that doesn't make it in to the movie. Hell, they can even put ""cue scary music"" or ""cue fast paced music"" at the top of the picture. I think I'm onto something. Probably not. But I'm leaving thinking I am. &&Love Rebecca Hall. Criminally underrated actress.&&I remember hearing about this movie back when RDJ first was announced to play Sherlock.&&Excited!&&I met Will Ferrell 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Will fucking Ferrell himself.

I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Will, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Will put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.
&&It looks as though they may finally be able to solve the mystery of ""Pam/Pan"".&&Shut up and take my money already

Will Ferrell makes very ‚Äòsimple‚Äô comedy that tends to fall into some kind of slapstick-American comedy genre that I find weak. Will Ferrell, for me, feels like a frat boy that refused to grow up and his comedy shows that. I expect this movie to have at least two fart jokes and some penis jokes. As many of Will Ferrell‚Äôs movies this will be a one time watch and then be forgotten. &&Will Ferrell has never been funny.&&I remember reading about this project back before the Guy Ritchie Sherlock movies came out.

There is no middle ground. &&Yesssssss! 
Step brothers was awesome imo (good chemistry) and I love Ralph Fiennes. Excited. &&I automatically smiled.&&I have been anticipating this for years, I‚Äôm so excited&&About 10 years ago Will ferrel was supposed to be in a movie called two faced where he was a white racist who gets a head injury and wakes from his coma and thinks he is black. I would have loved to see that. &&I'm there anytime I see Will Ferrell + John C Reilly.  Perfect comedic chemistry.  Love those two together.   &&Finally another movie with boats and hoes.&&Immediately sold.&&Um... Fuck. Fuck... yes. FUCK YES.&&I say Watson I miss the grand ole days of our adventures with boats and hoes, hahaha.

They tell Brennan and Dale that they did great, and reveal to the audience that this is a secret sequel to Step Brothers. The two do a quick shake n‚Äô bake, and the credits roll.&&Perfect balance since Stephen Fry was Mycroft earlier. &&Also, Rob Brydon as Inspector Lestrade, I'm 100% down for this!&&Voldemoriarty&&Rowan Atkinson as Moriarty a la Blackadder&&Casting Laurie is interesting, since he‚Äôs basically already played Sherlock Holmes.&&Just remember, it's the fact that Sherlock Holmes is in public domain that allows this movie to be made.

""Loud guy"" humor is what turns me off of Sandler, Ferrel, Chris Farley, etc in general. If he can tone it down then I can get into it. 

I'm just really irritated by 'LOOK AT ME I'M LOUD AND UNUSUAL' style humor. Ever been around someone who's like that in real life? It's insufferable. 

I've noticed there's been a trend away from this in the 2000's, and instead of sketch comedians with a schtick doing traditional comedies, we've seen a trend toward traditional dramatic actors doing comedic roles (and that's a good thing). &&True, but Will killed it and made Mark Walhberg so much funnier because of his reactions and delivery.

""Mulan is the epic adventure of a fearless young woman who masquerades as a man in order to fight Northern Invaders attacking China. The eldest daughter of an honored warrior, Hua Mulan is spirited, determined and quick on her feet. When the Emperor issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army, she steps in to take the place of her ailing father as Hua Jun, becoming one of China‚Äôs greatest warriors ever.""&&How come we don't have a first look from Aladdin yet?

Edit: No Huns either, if I recall correctly, and the main villain is a witch for some reason.&&What?! No Eddie Murphy dressed as a dragon on her shoulder?!? 2/10&&I want Mushu to be played by Eddie Murphy. Not CGI, not dressed like dragon, just Eddie Murphy hanging out. Maybe as a guy who thinks he‚Äôs a dragon & everyone just goes along with it.&&Damn, I was hoping they would cast Scarlett Johansson...&&See a lot of false information in the comments, some facts:

- Liu Yifei is a Chinese-American actress based out of Beijing.  Her last name is Liu. 

- The film will replace the Huns with another group of invaders, the Tujue/Gokturks. The Shan Yu character still exists and will be played by Jason Scott Lee
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-mulan-adds-jason-scott-lee-1129918

- However he will have a witch/shaman advisor  played by Gong Li (last name Gong)
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-mulan-lands-gong-li-jet-li-1101994

- Donnie Yen as a mentor is confirmed but Jet Li as the emperor is still in talks as of the above press release

- the story is set the Tang Dynasty, when the first ballad of her appeared but not when the ballad is set. The animated film had no announced time period and has elements from all over the place. 

- The Tang Dynasty is one of ancient China‚Äôs most liberal times (it had China‚Äôs only women emperor regent although she technically made up her own dynasty,  crossdressing was trendy for women of the time) with a lot of foreigners in the capital (modern day Xi‚Äôan). 

- As such, two Indian traders replace mushu as the main comic relief

- The love interest is now a fellow soldier who is very competitive with Mulan in being the best soldier.

- The film won‚Äôt be a full out musical but they will have music play a key role in it
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-mulan-lands-gong-li-jet-li-1101994

- Fa and Hua are different ways to say the same character, one Cantonese, one mandarin. 


- There‚Äôs little evidence that Mulan is a historical figure. She first appears in a ballad poem from the 6th century and not much is said except she joined the army to fight to replace her father and then returned home with honors. Since then, multiple plays have extended on the ballad but anything about her marriages are not ‚Äúthe original story of Mulan‚Äù.


Edit: sources&&I had forgot a live-action Mulan was on the way, she looks great!&&I hope we will get the szechuan sauce as a promotion to this movie again! (edit: typo) &&It's going to be tough to make her pass for a dude, she's very pretty&&Why is there live action movies about everything, why can‚Äôt we have old school 2D Disney movies and why is there still no Treasure Planet 2.&&Really disappointed Emma Stone was not cast as Mulan. She plays the best asians.&&Why the delays? Let's get down to business.&&I really don't understand their decisions here. 

They searched far and wide for this girl, but she's more a singer than actress (she won an equivalent of a Chinese Razzie Award for her acting lol).

So, no problem. At least she can sing well and she speaks good English. Problem is, *there's no songs!!* They took out all the famous music that everyone loves. 

I also have little interest now, because even if you want to go darker and explore/delve into the dramatic side of this legend, this is still a Disney feature. How dark and mature can you get? What you HAD going for you, Disney, *were the songs!!* &&I'm kind of surprised by the negativity of some of these comments.

I love the original Mulan for what it is, basically a fun musical/sports drama/coming-of-age story hybrid that has aged pretty well. But honestly, I think the scope and expressiveness of the characters and musical format is pitch-perfect in that *animated* version of Mulan. I don't think a direct translation to live-action would fare that well because there are so many moving parts that just seem to work better in animation (tiny talking sidekick, Huns 'popping out of the snow like daisies', making an improvised zipline from a lantern, etc). Maybe I'm burned after how much I hated the new Beauty and the Beast.

If I want to see the version of *Beauty and the Beast* I love, I'll just watch the 1991 version. I don't need to watch a shittier version of it with horrible wooden acting and directorial choices that make no sense. That's what I'm afraid will happen again if the movie producers think they actually should try to satisfy the fans who want live action films to be the exact same as the animated original beat-by-beat.

In the same sense, if I want to nostalgia-trip about Mulan, I can just cue up the animated version. I already know that's going to be the best version of that particular iteration.

In the end, the 1998 version isn't the provenance of Mulan. It's a Chinese folktale. I don't see a problem with returning to the source material and making a different interpretation, one that is mainly for the audience that knows the original folktale.

Yeah, being cynical, this is probably just a cash grab for the Chinese market. But Beauty and the Beast (which was nearly entirely faithful to the animated version, just a watered down, poorly acted and overall shittier version of it) was a cynical cash grab for nostalgic Americans. I'm actually kind of happy they're doing something different.&&Yeah, that looks like Mulan.&&Scarlett Johansson looks so different &&The live action movie feels like what a different studio would do to differentiate from the animated Disney movie more than it would as a live action remake (feels like it‚Äôs closer to a Mowgli than a Jungle Book, based on the proposed changes that we know).&&Too bad they're removing bisexual Shang. One of the best parts of the movie.&&She‚Äôs going to get caught, she totally looks like a woman. &&Disney, baby, I get you want to recapture the Renaissance. But if everyone tried to imitate Michelangelo, then we would never get Romanticism, Modern, Progressive, Post Modern, or the like. Look at your past, the reason you have always seen success is in new and interesting fairy tales and stories. &&It's ridiculous how many people in this thread have no fucking idea that Mulan wasn't invented by Disney.&&[deleted]&&Looks like Disney finally got down to business, to defeat the Huns...&&Please tell me instead of saying ""action"" at the start of every take, the director says ""LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS""&&Please tell me they changed the plot from that atrocious one that was leaked a while back. &&Am I the only one hurt/offended by all these live action/remakes? Why couldn't they just leave the legend for what it was? That's what makes them so special. I loved Lion King, I loved Aladdin..Mulan. Shit doesn't get any better. Maybe I'm being paranoid of my childhood. But, there's no way in fuck they'll ever compare to originals. Money grabbing motherfuckers..

The only person I like even doing any of these is Will Smith. Which i still don't think he should do it. And as much as I love Will Smith..he's got big shoes to fill..

Fuck this shit!&&With Mushu gone, I highly doubt Cri-Kee or the Ancestors will be in.

And I haven't heard anything about Ling, Yao or Chien-Po either. Idk if this can even count as a remake. &&What's next, her family? The emperor? China itself?&&So it‚Äôs not a live action remake of the animated film but a new story about her origins? I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm a bit confused. I thought that‚Äôs what these Disney Live Action films were about. &&I remember hearing it just wasn‚Äôt gonna be a musical but nothing was off the table.

Haven‚Äôt heard anything about Mushu or Shang though. Dont know why everyone is saying Mushu is gone. &&I‚Äôm really baffled by this attitude. Why do you guys want them to just do a 1:1 remake rather than try something new? Why do you want to line up and pay a fair bit of money just to see a pale imitation of what you already know and love?

Bruh&&This is the first time I‚Äôve heard about it. &&Someone get McDonalds on the phone!&&

Let's get down to business&&I can see her passing as a dude. I think it's the nose that does it, but she looks like one of my guy friends when I imagine her with short hair.&&I can totally see her pretending to be a guy, just cover her hair and she totally looks like a teenage to early 20 year old man. A very boyish one, but that works better for the plot imo&&Eh, I feel like asian males and females with sharper chins (like hers) tend to be more androgynous when different haircuts come into play. One example being some male kpop stars looking extremely feminine. Source: am an Asian male&&Still a chance Scarlett is cast as the male love interest. &&Good to see Hollywood casting asians to play Asian characters though&&Apparently a lot of Donnie Yen drama, though of course that hasn't been confirmed.&&>she won an equivalent of a Chinese Razzie Award for her acting lol

I mean, several great actors have won Razzies. I'm not really familiar with her acting, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she's incapable of giving a good performance.&&because she's not a singer... she mainly does period dramas in China and does it well (mainly because she looks the part)&&She‚Äôs a famous TV actress... not known as a singer AT ALL. Why did so many people upvote this comment?&&what are you talking about. She‚Äôs released one Japanese album and that‚Äôs it. 

She‚Äôs one of the most famous and popular actresses of her generation (edit: in China, but also probably one the best known Chinese actresses in the rest of Asia) with multiple household name characters and shows.&&It doesn‚Äôt matter as long as Chinese buy this.&&She's very popular in China.  In China, artists cross over between acting and singing alot.  The traditional route in the Hong Kong entertainment industry used to be tv shows and then moving on to singing and movies.  She's done alot of TV shows which built up her recognition but Chinese TV doesn't pay much so they have to earn via singing, being a spokesperson for a brand and movies.  These days they may still do TV shows just to keep themselves in the public eye even if the pay sucks.

Her breakout role and her other most famous role were for characters that had little to no emotion.  She was just there because of her pretty face and that hasn't hurt her career in China.  I'm really not sure she can sing that well either. 

There's also that convention that once an Asian has been in a hollywood movie they will favour you in future castings.&&They didn't ""take out the music that everyone loves"". This isn't a retelling of the animated western version of Mulan. This is an on-screen retelling of The Ballad of Hua Mulan, which never included those songs in the first place. This time, this version isn't about western audiences, but rather, a celebration of asian culture, which should be more about the actual folktale, instead of some song and dance that's not applicable to the story.&&Sandra Bullock won a Worst Actress Razzie and a Best Actress Oscar the same weekend.&&Lol she‚Äôs always been an actress over a singer. Stop spreading false information.&&Honestly, if I wanted to hear the same songs, I would just watch the original Mulan.

I'm going to watch this one specifically because it's different and is it's own thing, not sucking up to the animation.  Look at Beauty and the Beast.  It tried too hard to be the animated movie and ended up sucking.

Plus the movie looks to be actually taking my ancestor's culture more seriously than the offensive original Mulan.&&It doesn't matter if she can act so much that she can make them money. She's one of the new 4 Dan actress, which basically means she's known for being g able to bring in the audience in China. She may not be able to act, but she's extremely popular. She's like a Schwarzenegger in the 90s here, can't act but definitely brings in the audience.&&Know what you are talking about before you sprout outrage. She's an actress primarily, not a singer. &&It honestly kinda annoys me that it‚Äôs so far removed from the animated Mulan but you‚Äôre right. The great sin of these live action remakes is they don‚Äôt take enough risks to get away from the source material. They‚Äôre just kinda copy/pasted with seemingly no effort thrown in besides trying to make things worse (and they‚Äôre usually CGI‚Äôd to death). 

So, them trying a little to remove themselves away from the old one is probably smart. &&Is the original folktale about a witch?&&
>making an improvised zipline from a lantern

You clearly haven‚Äôt seen Rush Hour then&&And the woman Lea Salonga who voiced Mulans songs in the animated movie was so perfect. She was Eponine and Fauntine (spelling?) in Les Mis at one point and she's so beautiful and has one of the best voices I've ever heard. I believe she also sang Jasmin's songs in Alladin, but I may be remembering that wrong. She was my favorite singer when I was a kid. &&Asian ‚òëÔ∏è&&She is one here. This is clearly a woman‚Äôs outfit and her pose is the same as the one at the end of the film when she‚Äôs a woman fighting Shan Yu on the roof&&Yeah but a lot of people are seeing this as a remake of Disney's Mulan. Not based on the story that Mulan is based on&&...But the article literally says it's a remake of the 1998 Disney film. It's not outrageous to expect they would draw *some* things from that film, especially with the cut-and-paste Beauty and the Beast remake they made. &&What was the leaked plot? &&He‚Äôs rich AF compared to Jackie Chan and can now do whatever he wants. That said, Jet Li‚Äôs Hong Kong movies are fucking boss. The One, on the other hand, might just be one of my least favorite action movies of all time. &&Jet Li is partially crippled. I forgot what happened but he has a disease/ailment with advanced aging and muscle issues these days. A quick Google search can point you in the right direction.

The quote from him about his ailment that got me teary eyed was (me paraphrasing) how despite all the heroic and legendary Chinese figures he has protrayed through his acting career, inspiring billions with him as the face of those characters,he when it comes down to it, is just Jet Li. A mere mortal human. 

DAMN.

It's almost like the story with Christopher Reeves and Superman.&&He likely won't be in anymore. He's sick now, which means he'll likely be retiring, if he hasn't already. It's quite sad, actually.&&XXX Return of Xandar Cage was garbage story with garbage dialogue with garbage acting (except for Toni Collete). It was like a Walmart $5 rack movie. BUT, all of Donnie Yen‚Äôs action scenes were fucking 100% fire.&&If I like Donnie Yen but I've only seen Rogue One and Ip Man, what should I watch next? &&You like the homie from the raid?


Coming in that upcoming mile 22 movie or whatever&&iamonewiththeforceandtheforceiswithme&&Mandarin more commonly spoken, means bigger draw in the China market when released.&&Was confused I was somehow mishearing the original when I saw the headline. I was like, I'm like 99% sure it said Fa...&&And Jun as a name instead of Ping. So no more Fapping jokes. &&I wonder if it's because of all the jokes about Fa Ping...&&Bear in mind that Chinese, like many other languages, underwent shifts in pronunciation over time. Mulan is a middle Chinese poem, ~~and today's Hua pronunciation was similar to Fa from the relevant time period.~~ apparently it was actually still pretty close to modern Hua, which surprised me!

Edit: link https://youtu.be/__vHa_JZ_iM&&I was REALLY hoping she'd have a cameo as one of the ancestors.&&There‚Äôs no reason for her not to be in there somewhere. &&Well, Ping did steal Mushu‚Äôs girl.&&They aren't even using the Huns.&&What?  The live action Beauty and the Beast was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the original.  If this is anything like that Shan Yu will be literally the exact same character that he was in the original.&&Holy shit that dude IS Aladdin&&I didn't even realize there was a live action Aladdin in the works. Is Will Smith in it or just visiting the set?&&The real question is, will Gilbert Gottfried reprise his role.&&I just wanna see first look of Jasmine's outfits.&&This could be a toothpaste ad.

Girl hasnt aged&&Because she'd beat the Huns before the movie even starts.&&Googled Elsa Jean at work... oops!&&Seriously. Genuine question, have there been any that haven't, at best, been entirely redundant?&&She is really pretty but can't act. Her most famous roles in China are ones where the character is just pretty but without much emotion or character.&&Or at least put Eddie Murphy in a cheap dragon suit.&&> Why did they even start making it at all?

China. Unlike Beauty and the Beast, this movie is not being made to cater to nostalgic millennials. It's being made to cater to China. That's why it's no longer a musical.  

EDIT: Just so we're clear I'm not upset by it. I don't have a problem with it being changed to be more popular in China. It's just a fact. These changes are very deliberate. &&IMDB states that the baddie is a witch, purely so they can have fantasy elements like Mushu. Then again, IMDB...&&Based on the folk tale of Hua Mulan. maybe to respect the story?

Edit: Some of you really need to chill. &&[deleted]&&I find that a kind of weird criticism.  I think a practically-shot-for-shot remake with live action and CGI is all a lot of people want from their remakes in the first place.

Sure, the Beauty and the Beast remake has no real need to exist, but no Beauty and the Beast remake had a need to exist, and the one they made worked because they didn't really mess with an already successful movie.

Mulan's also a case where the movie's songs and comic relief characters are some of its most popular components (at least from what I've seen, which would admittedly be mainly the opinions of western, especially American audiences), so cutting those really takes away a lot of Disney fans' motivation to see the movie.

Someone else did give an explanation that seems very likely to me, though: They're targeting Chinese audiences.  If the original Mulan wasn't popular in China, I could definitely see Disney being willing to risk alienating western fans of the original in the hopes of being a massive hit in China.&&The closest you're ever gonna get is watching [Jackie Chan sing the Chinese version and doing some martial arts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6IYt2qMj1A).&&Maybe they could work that in as a something tbr soldiers sing on the march.&&The songs were the best part of the jungle book. Louis's song was really great.&&Have you seen the trailer for the live action version of The Little Mermaid? I was so excited when I heard about it, watched the trailer, and now I don't even want to see it. &&The trio and Cricket are all in the casting calls, but cricket is just a fellow soldier called Cricket.&&I believe the reason they're axing the songs is because musicals don't do very well with Chinese audiences, which they're betting big on for this film.&&Jungle Book also had I Wanna Be Like You.

Have them at least hum ""Make a Man Out Of You""&&Having ""Bear Necessities"" in the movie made sense. In this case, doing so wouldn't make sense. It seems certain that what's going to be on screen is meant to be a celebration of Chinese culture this time, instead of a production created completely by western writers and animators. &&The villains will be the fireworks.&&Maybe because the Huns never invaded China, and the whole idea of them in Mulan as villains doesn‚Äôt really make any sense. They were never in China. It would make a lot more sense to substitute them for, say, Mongols or Manchurians. &&*Hey man why you gotta bring that up? Hey you ain't even a man. I'm talkin to a cricket! Look at me I'm insane. Bad dragon, bad!*&&... they just started production! Just write him in!

""Did I hear someone ask for a miracle? Let me hear you say 'aaah'!""&&Last Samurai tie-in?&&Oh man, she‚Äôd make the perfect Asian Woman in her early 20s, no doubt about it!&&That‚Äôs one reason it kept getting delayed - same with Aladdin - they were really trying to get casting down right. And for Aladdin after they got Will Smith they wanted mostly unknowns in the other lead roles&&To defeat...a wiiiiiitch...because there are no Huuuuuuns in this fiiiiiilm.

It doesn't have the same ring to it :(&&and Tilda Swinton as the imposing general &&Some of them even turn up to collect their Razzies!&&She was my ultimate girl crush in The Return of the Condor Heroes back when I was younger. But watching it now, she's just floating around with a poker face.&&That's the other issue, I saw a user in this sub a while back compare this story to their King Arthur. It's been adapted so many times no one gives a shit anymore. &&The  top Chinese comments for almost every news about the film except for her casting are ‚Äúwell this is weird but I guess this film was made for a Western audience.‚Äù   

Even looking at this photo, she looks more‚ÄùWestern stereotype of attractive Asian‚Äù here than she usually looks, with more angular facial structures, higher cheekbones, bigger nose, darker skin (but that may be due to war), and thicker brows. The heavy  fabric and the way the collars pop out would also be very weird if this was a Chinese production.&&The original ballad also didn't feature the Huns, or Mushu, or Shang...

Like u/rkgk13 said, it's a different interpretation so they can put their own spin on it&&She sang in an episode of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend on the CW where looked as young as ever and sounded just like she did 20 years ago. What a talented woman. &&To be fair, that's a really high bar for Hollywood.&&It's been cited everywhere as a 'remake' instead of Disney making a live-action Mulan film. There hasn't been much in the PR department to really set the two apart, probably so they can bank on interest from nostalgia. &&But that's just extra pointless, because they're trying to appeal to the Chinese market with it while that market already has their share of Mulan movies. This is like if the biggest Chinese studio tried to appeal to the west by releasing a King Arthur movie - we've seen it before, why watch a Chinese version that misses the point?&&Not the plot per say but the casting call shows too much changes for my liking, especially the love interest. Add to this that there's no songs, no Mushu, a different villain (a witch), Mulan has special powers that make her kickass besides earning it, etc, means I'm not currently interested in this movie. 


*MULAN ‚Äì Female, 18-20 years old to play 18; must be able to speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese; lithe, athletic, quick, tougher than she looks. Mulan lives in rural China in 630 AD, and her country is besieged, under attack by the Gokturk invaders. When her aging father volunteers to join the Army, Mulan sneaks out by night and takes his place, strapping down her breasts so she can pass for a man. There is a mysterious power inside Mulan, a power of speed and coordination and sheer force that places her at the peak of her unit ‚Äî where no one suspects her secret.*


*CHEN HONGHUI ‚Äì Male, in his 20s, must be able to speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese; strapping, cocky, and handsome. Honghui is another recruit who joins Commander Tung‚Äôs unit, and he‚Äôs determined to be the best soldier in human history. Full of himself, with a mean, bullying streak to him, he quickly realizes that Mulan is his chief rival, but he does not realize that she is a woman. Grittily determined to be simply the best at everything, Honghui is increasingly peeved by Mulan‚Äôs ability to match or out-maneuver him. But after learning that his rival is a woman, his intense feelings of rivalry turn into something very different, something like love.*

It begins many years ago, with Jackie deciding to buy a nearly 400-year-old sandalwood house, which he planned to disassemble and rebuild in Hong Kong for his aging father (who died in 2008) to live in.&&Jackie Chan is worth more than Jet Li. Jackie Chan is like the Star Bucks of China, he is everywhere. Even does pop music. &&Uhhh sounds like he only has hyperthyroidism.&&I know as a human being dying and aging is inevitable. But as a martial artist and someone who enjoys using my mind and body its truly a horrific thing to consider  that one day i will lose control over both those things eventually.

I can imagine a person as talented and physically capable as he once was it must be humbling and frustrating.

&&I haven't seen this one even when the original xXx is one of my favorite action movies&&Wasn't Tony Jaa in it too?&&SPL and Flashpoint are two of my favourite martial arts movies of all time. Kung Fu Killer is a bit underappreciated imo, but I also like it a lot. &&And unless they really screw up, this movie is going to ***kill*** in China.

Edit: Yes, I know this is a story based on Chinese folklore. Yes, I know there are many Chinese made Mulan films. Yes, I know that the animated film didn't do super well there.

I lived in Mainland China for several years, and it is my personal opinion based on purely anecdotal evidence that this film could do well there. However, feel free to be unlike the G train, and disagree with me.&&I know, I don't mind the change (Mandarin speaker myself), just thought it was interesting.&&Hua was the surname in the original folktale, which is what the new movie is based on&&That joke aside, looking at it now, I noticed that if they used the Hua surname and the Ping nickname, her name would be Hua Ping, which is how ""vase"" is pronounced in Mandarin.   In Chinese, vase can be used as a derogatory term to describe females as being pretty on the outside, but lacking substance on the inside; basically good for nothing but looks. The name would be extremely ironic on Mulan.&&She really should be The mom though.  How perfect would that have been!!&&Why not?&&How are they supposed to get down to business??&&> The live action Beauty and the Beast was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the original.

This gives me hope I may still live to see Eddie Murphy fired in to a mountain on a rocket.&&From what I've read this isn't a remake of the disney movie but from the original tale. &&STREET RAT!&&It's the smile. For some reason Aladdin always stood out to me as very... Teethy, compared to other Disney movies. I dunno why. &&That‚Äôs the first thing I thought too, they nailed the casting. &&Before reading your comment I said the exact same thing, I don't think you could pick a better choice solely based on looks alone. &&Will Smith looks like Red Skull.&&So that's what this is? Some kind of Aladdin or something? &&He plays The Genie.

EDIT : Grammar&&No, in fact I heard he recently refused to reprise the voice for Iago for a Disneyland attraction as a way of protesting James Gunn's firing. &&I bet you *do.*&&No woman is hot enough to be Jasmine. 

She inspired a man to use an entire magical wish so he could ride and elephant and kick down her palace door yelling how horny (amorous) he is. &&[deleted]&&What, like the monkey and tiger? Where did you read that?&&Source? I can't see them removing Abu, or Iago for that matter.&&I mean don‚Äôt Asians look like they are twenty until they are in their 40‚Äôs and then when they hit 60 they look 100? &&Hahahah! &&I enjoyed Cinderella. They actually gave the prince a name and a backstory and a personality. And Cinderella had a personality beyond ‚Äúreally nice and talks to animals‚Äù. &&Christopher Robin I think.  They touched on the past Pooh stories and references, but the story itself was simple and very Pooh like.&&I enjoyed the Cinderella movie, but that's because Lily James is a delight. &&I thought Maleficent was a pretty original take on sleeping beauty. It had flaws definitely, but I walked out of that one with more new thoughts about the original subject matter than I did after walking out of Beauty and the Beast. Also it seems like his Milan movie is deliberately not trying to be a remake of the original but rather a retelling if the story, so tell probably still feel fresh if it‚Äôs executed well.&&Jungle Book. Jungle Book was much better than the animated film imo.&&Almost verbatim remakes as far as I‚Äôve seen. At least with Beauty & the Beast. Cinderella had some added story elements but was mostly the same, with Christopher Robin and Pete‚Äôs Dragon being spins on the original concept. They haven‚Äôt added anything ‚Äúnew‚Äù in my opinion. Just retreading the same old ground in live action.&&a la Wilfred&&Which, ostensibly, may make for a better film. Instead of going for a changed-but-not-for-the-better remake like BATB, it sounds like they're going for a faithful adaptation of the *Ballad of Mulan*.&&I find the trend of Hollywood appeasing China (no Chinese villains ever, awkwardly added Chinese heroes, etc) to generally be bad, but in this case it‚Äôs fine by me. It‚Äôs a Chinese story so it makes sense to be as China-friendly as possible.

I‚Äôm also happy for the remakes to distance themselves from the originals. If I want a talking dragon and songs about how to Be A Man, I‚Äôll watch the animated movie again.&&There are already several Chinese Mulan movies though.&&A wuxia war film can have a lot of appeal.  &&Let's get down to business!  To defeat...a wiiiiiiitch?  Did they send me waters, to pour on...the wiiiiiitch?

This song sucks. :(&&[deleted]&&If that's the case, this is actually the first live-action remake I'm actually interested in. &&[deleted]&&Then they probably should have her riding horses and fighting nomads. &&Also, Mushu is such a stereotypical name..&&Personally, I just don‚Äôt see the point in a scene-perfect remake. I‚Äôd much rather see a new take on the same story than an attempt to repeat the exact same movie but with real people. 

Beauty and the Beast was surprisingly solid for what it was, I‚Äôll admit. But I‚Äôm not upset about the songs that were cut from Lion King or Mushu not being in this, because I already *have* those versions of the movies. 

I really didn‚Äôt like Maleficent, but I appreciate that they didn‚Äôt just make it the same as Sleeping Beauty. &&I've seen that video many a time (it was on the original Mulan DVD), it was my introduction years ago to Jackie Chan - Musical Performer.

EDIT: Actually, I think it might be really cool if they have a low key version of this song (the Chinese version) run over the end crfedits of the new film, just as a little nod to the old film.&&Congratulations! Celebrating 100 years of Jackie Chan&&They sing A Girl Worth Fighting For while marching. And they wouldn‚Äôt probably put that in today because people think it is sexist. I could only see them singing the ‚Äúwe must be as swift as a coursing river...‚Äù part while marching. The rest of the song is meant to be sung at them, not by them. &&Well that's not a Disney production. It's just a film that's loosely based on the concept of The Little Mermaid.&&That makes sense.  The songs and comic relief characters might be the most popular part of the movie with American audiences, and Disney fans might mostly just want a nearly-shot-for-shot live-action remake of the original like they did with Beauty and the Beast, but American Disney fans aren't the biggest potential audience for this movie.  If Mulan wasn't a hit in China, then it's definitely not surprising that Disney wants to change it and target it more towards Chinese audiences and try to replicate Kung Fu Panda's success.&&So we're getting a Disney Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with a Mulan story skin? &&Nah, it wouldn't make sense. This isn't based off of the western animated movie ""Mulan"". This is a retelling of the folk tale from China, which doesn't include that song at all. This movie's basically made as a celebration of asian culture this time, instead of something made for westerners.&&I'd be fine with them using mongols.&&And do you know why the Huns never invaded China?

Because of Mulan!&&When you start production it means lots of the major decisions have already been made but none of it is on film yet. Changing things means changing other things that makes things expensive. I mean yea better to do it at the start of production but if he is not in there already there's a good chance they feel strongly about it and came up with ways to make it up. Only when it is crafted to a certain degree does it seem obvious major changes should be made. But rn whatever they have planned, in theory, works without him.&&Tell me how he died. &&‚ÄúThe Last Nigga on Earth, starring Tom Hanks‚Äù&&*Did they film with Witches...when we asked for Huns*&&Witches get stitches. &&With Ben Kingsley as the surprise not-villain, its really another white guy&&Sandra Bullock went and got hers the same week she got her Oscar IIRC&&Good old Halle Berry.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-7s_yeQuDg&&Her character is suppose to have a poker face.  That‚Äôs what her type of martial arts requires and part of the reason  why she looks 18 even when she‚Äôs like 40 at the end of the show. &&well... that was partly because for the martial art she was training in she can't express any emotions&&Oh my god yes! I loved her in that show. Not because of her, but because of her character. Same with Yang Mi's character Guo Xiang. Liu Yifei and Yang Mi were two mediocre actors that tricked me into liking them by the merit of the characters they played.&&Yeah.  Li looks very aged due to his ailments.&&Also Jackie Chan's doing a lot of movies because he wants to transition into a serious actor. As he's getting older, he doesn't want to be known only for his comedic/action movies anymore. That's why he took The Foreigner.&&Chan probably pays a fortune for insurance though &&Yup. He's likely retiring at this point, which is sad. I hope that he's able to find a way through his issues.&&It's like Highlander, but way later.&&I like it too! It‚Äôs goofy but not in a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre trying to be goofy‚Äù sorta way, which I think is different than ‚Äúso bad that it‚Äôs good.‚Äù 

My friends and I used to quote ‚ÄúOh shit, he‚Äôs doing 50!‚Äù when someone was running.&&I fuckin love The One. Granted, I haven‚Äôt seen too many martial arts movies, so maybe I just don‚Äôt have much to compare it to. But that scene where he plunges his arms into two motorcycles and uses them as bludgeons is just the tits.&&Yer my doge!&&Lol I love in the beginning when he's all whooping ass and fucking *Drowning Pool* starts playing. It's like the most cheesy awesome early 2000's moment. So good.&&Yeah, he legit just has hyperthyroidism and some work injuries, which is fairly common. Not to say that there aren't more severe cases.

But rumors like the above (above-above?) comment are why his manager is trying to [assure people that he's fine, more or less.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/05/21/a-photo-has-jet-li-fans-worried-about-this-health-again/?utm_term=.578bc9957b59)

Moral of the story: Do more than ""a quick Google search"". Thoughts & prayers doe.&&Sounds like the poster has case of ‚Äúkilling off beloved celebrity in dramatic fashion before their time‚Äù syndrome. 

Jet Li was so awesome, my childhood was rife with watching his movies and OUATIC/Legend of Fong Sai Yuk were classics. All his fights ouatic 2 were amazing, esp his 15 min one against Donnie Yen&&Indeed he was. Tony Jaa has some of my favorite fight scenes. That uncut fight scene running up the spiral ramp in The Protector gets me hyped every time.&&He was, but a pretty small role. He popped in for the occassional jump and flip. Unfortunately, Tony Jaa‚Äôs English and acting are a lot to be desired. Most of his dialogue scenes came off super awkward. Luckily, the majority of the dialogue and acting in this movie with pretty atrocious.&&Is it going to be Chinese or English language. I wonder how hard it is to shoot every scene in both languages.&&Maybe.  Sometimes people aren‚Äôt interested in a Western adaptation of one of their own stories...even if it has some of their stars.

Kinda the equivalent of a Chinese produced American Revolution film starring George Clooney as Washington.  Could be a hit or people would rather watch Tom Cruise run.&&[deleted]&&I‚Äôd be very surprised if it did. China pumps out a live action Mulan every 4 years or so. It‚Äôs their story, their folklore. They‚Äôre probably not going to like this American made knock off even if it‚Äôs good. They didn‚Äôt like the original cartoon at all.&&I don't speak either language and I'm **PISSED!**&&They are the exact same name Ëä±, it means flower. Just different pronunciation based on language/dialect. 

In the Minnan dialect (what they speak in Fujuan province and Taiwan) she is Hoe Boklan, in Cantonese she is Fa Muklan, and in Standard Chinese (Mandadin) she is Hua Mulan.

The Disney movie was weird because it uses the Cantonese pronunciation for the surname and Mandarin for the given name. The story is also about the Northern Wei, who are partially sinicized proto-Mongols and predate the Xiongnu (or Huns in the Disney movie). They would have spoken an extinct language called Tuoba that resembles Mongolian.

The folktale is set in the 6th century, they spoke Middel Chinese back then. That means she really should be called Hw√¶ Muk-lan.

The chinese script isn't phonetic so the same word can be basically pronunced however you want and varies from region to region.

&&Fa Jun is actually another way to say vase in Cantonese so if it's ever dubbed in Cantonese... &&It says Northern Invaders so I'm guessing just Mongolians?&&It's a totally different story.  There's a witch in this one.  And it's not a musical :(&&My impression, based on other comments in this thread, is that they're dramatically changing this one in the hope of appealing to Chinese audiences, which seems like it might include cutting out the music and comic relief characters, which definitely drops my enthusiasm a lot.

Seems like it might be closer to an entirely new movie based on the folk story than a remake of the animated one.&&There's no Mushu in this version.  :(&&Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Seems like Disney wants this to be a big hit in China, where, according to Wikipedia, people complained that Mulan looked too foreign and the story was too different from the original folktale (although apparently the government also messed it up by only giving it a limited release a year later during holiday season when it would have tons of competition from local films, in retaliation for Disney funding a film about the Dalai Lama the year before).

So instead of targeting fans of the original like they are with their other remakes, it seems like this one's being targeted at Chinese audiences, which makes sense (with Kung Fu Panda showing how successful an American movie about Chinese folklore can be in China if it's done well and found to be respectful to the folklore).  But it sucks for all the people who mostly just wanted ""realistic"" CGI Mushu and live action ""I'll Make a Man Out of You.""&&RIFF-RAFF!&&I agree.

First movie that my son never got up once for candy or a bathroom break. I swear I was smiling the whole way through.&&She is, I adore her. I think Cinderella worked too because Disney kind of leaned into what it always was - which was a slightly boring, but very pretty, very sweet fairytale. The live action captured that well and didn't try to make it bigger than it was. &&And now you can just watch Mamma Mia to see her being a delight and singing. &&This is probably one of my top 10 favorite movies. They gave Brannaugh artistic freedom to make an individual film that wasn‚Äôt a cookie-cutter copy of the animated film.

Lily James and Richard Madden have wonderful chemistry. I truly felt the passion and attraction between the two characters.

I could take or leave Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother but I thought she was pleasant and I liked her voice-over narration.&&Indeed.

I don't really want a shot for shot remake of a movie I've already seen, and I really don't want a fan service pandering remake like BATB. Part of me is a bit disappointed we won't get the songs as I consider Mulan to have the best music of that era of Disney, but then again, there's already a movie with those songs that isn't going anywhere. &&They did something similar with their live Hunchback From Notre Dame stage play. Same songs, more faithful adaptation.&&hasn't Asian men always being depicted as the villain and evil been going on long enough&&But did Disney get their money?&&Exactly, the only reason people want to watch it is because it is a Disney film. But they removed everything Disney about it, so people aren't as excited about it.&&There‚Äôs no singing&&If she's made of wood, well then she's....a witch!

Build a bridge out of her, and we'll cross....this ditch!&&Same with Beauty and the Beast, which is almost exactly retells the Gisney version.&&Yeah but this time it's all about that Chinese money.&&You should watch the Chinese version of Mulan it's super violent&&Yeah, I feel like a lot of people will be pissed, but I'm very down for a more realistic version of the story. It's such a great tale that I think it can be done well in many ways.&&It was not ""conscription"". Mulan's family belonged to a class that receives land and benefit from the empire in exchange for armed services. They are in all essence, the European knightly class, though really low level knights. Mulan's father, or if she had any brothers, had a duty to keep themselves trained, ready, and fit for service at moment's notice. If they can't provide military service, the payment to them would be removed (their land grants, stipends, tax benefits etc...)

That's why Mulan's family has war horses, armor, and weapons. Three things feudal Chinese peasants usually are forbidden to own.

Wei dynasty and Tang dynasty that followed had nomadic blood, a lot of their military policies, such as having a warrior class is vestige from the ""every tribal member has to fight"" tradition back in the Steppes. &&It's the name of an American Chinese dish. No self-respecting dragon would name himself ""chicken egg"". *

*Yes, apparently that's what muxu is.

I'd much rather see a new animated feature based on a different story than ""here's a story we told before, but slightly different"". China in particular has a ton of history and mythology to draw from, why limit it to just mulan as ""the Chinese Disney story""?

It seems especially dumb considering there are apparently a number of Chinese Mulan movies they'll be competing against, and that won't be as easy of a competition as they think.

It would be much cooler to bring a Disney version of the story of, say, Son Wukong to the west instead.&&Or just the beat of the song during the training scenes &&> it was my introduction years ago to Jackie Chan - Musical Performer.

I think Will Smith has the chops to be funny with the role, but I do think he will be different and not try to imitate Robin Williams.  When you look at Dan Castellaneta, he is obviously freaking funny (best known for Homer Simpson), but when he tried to do Genie imitating Robin Williams for Return of Jafar and the TV series, it just never held up very well.  

To make this work Will Smith has to be free to be himself and not feel like he has to try to be Robin Williams.  &&The new pink power ranger plays Jasmine&&*Men in Black* era Will Smith = Great for Genie

‚ÄúDid you let me go?‚Äù&&It was a fine film, but for me, personally, her incessant cheerfulness was a bit annoying and made her feel a bit empty headed.

And she only puts up with them for some stupid ""take care of the house"" thing she ends up abandoning in the end of the film anyway, so it all feels rather arbitrary and pointless to begin with. 

But I digress, even though I didn't care for her I love what they did with the prince and his dad! That image of him curled up on the bed was the best shot in the film. Loved every scene they were in.&&I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more along the vein of Hook&&But I was ready to at least get down to business and defeat some Huns.

""Let's get down to business.  To defeat...a wiiiiiiitch""  That song fucking sucks.&&There was already a Chinese treatment of Mulan, with soldiers and battles and shit. It was made back in 2009. I watched parts of it and it was alright, but I don't know enough about Chinese cinema to tell if it was good, bad or average.&&And the musical is great because of that.

Where can I find it?&&It drove me crazy that after the beginning there were only like, five total people in Mulan's army. &&I don‚Äôt get how a witch as a villain is more realistic though.

honestly, based on my recollection from watching, this was the best part.. cast was pretty good, and overall plot seemed interesting, but the character development and screen writing were not that great which led to a fairly anticlimactic move through the plot.

I can understand the difficulty in having a monkey character on stage, but the musical had Aladdin take jewels from the Cave of Wonders, which IMO is a fairly significant change for his character.  I'm sure they can think of something, but I would not be a fan of them taking any notes from the play.&&I think the rumor was Mulan wouldn‚Äôt have Mushu, not that Aladdin wouldn‚Äôt have Abu.

That was amazing. &&If you enjoy seamless transitions like this I must recommend the Hulu original ‚Äúcastle rock‚Äù I don‚Äôt feel like explaining the whole show but episode 7 is one of the best episodes of TV I‚Äôve ever seen. This particular episode is entirely from the point of view of Sissy Spacek who is suffering from dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs And has more and more trouble grasping where and when she is. While she spends the episode physically in her house trying to get away from and outsmart an intruder, every room she enters or cabinet she opens triggers a new jump and she finds herself reliving and even sometimes spectating different events from throughout her life and constantly trying to ground herself in the present again to focus on the matter at hand.

Is it just one guy who watches them and makes notes?  Are the clips tagged in some automated system?

That wasn‚Äôt impressive.&&Why would you waste any time searching for s lame ass commercial showcasing movies finally old enough to be on TV?  Why?&&It really is. The graphics in the open are the only real dated thing about this. I did trailer editing and when we would do competitive audits, the editing for trailers even as near as 5 years ago was rough. Trends change pretty quick. This trailer was so smooth, and the editor did a fantastic job breaking down the films to this degree to be able and build out all those moments. This is the kind of sizzle you would see on HBO or FX today. So good. &&Yeah, 2005 doesn't seem that long ago, does it? Before the MCU really began and took off with Iron Man, before Netflix's streaming service was released and they mailed DVDs, George W. Bush was into his second term as U.S. President, the first iPhone wasn't released, YouTube's first video was uploaded, I think I saw a lot of news about Huricane Katrina that year (I lived on the East Coast, forgot where exactly the hurricane hit), Shadow of the Colossus, Kingdom Hearts 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Mario Kart DS were games that came out and among the ones that I played.

Oh, and Star Wars: Episode III came out that year as well. ***GENERAL KENOBI!***&&I was just thinking that.  Imagine how long that took to edit &&I mean, it‚Äôs not a whole lot more than a series of (excellent) match cuts, which is one of the oldest editing techniques in film.

Imagine a Star Trek that took place entirely on Earth.  Shit is mundane.

The American Gods series is more in line with what is supposed to be coming out of these titles.  Weird freaky shit, built on ancient folklore and Deep Time.  Gaiman built that shit, and inspired a whole universe of characters and how they work.  Sandman, Swamp Thing, Constantine, Lucifer, the Books of Magic.  I could go on.

While we were in there this very attractive drunk girl started beating on the door and saying how bad she wanted to fuck him.  He told security to kick her out, that she was interrupting his conversation with his friends.  I have not seen him since then, but it was very humbling to me that he gave us such respect after only knowing him for 10 minutes. &&I read this, then yelled ""play Citizen Cope"" across the room at my Echo, and it played this song.

So as I was working in VFX as a compositor, I was cutting sizzles, and fake trailers. Copying trends, finding my rhythm as an editor, and building up a portfolio of videos I could share with job prospects. 

I got a call from the creative director of a trailer house in Burbank who came across my stuff and loved my work. We had coffee, nerded out over movies and tv for an hour and he sent me home with a skills test. I edited a trailer for the test, a couple weeks later they gave me a job.

This isn't just my way of pronouncing it, it is mentioned in the comics themselves, in the Hellblazer comics he replies to someone pronouncing it ""Constanteen"" that it should be pronounced ""Constantyne"".

And the creator of the character (Alan Moore, also creator of Watchmen and V for Vendetta) confirmed that it should be pronounced like that.

It's a minor thing, but in every single adaptation they pronounce it like ""teen"" at the end, it just bothers me.

Weird one, and not that important in the grand scheme of things, but yeah.....pet peeve of mine I suppose.&&Americans pronounce it Con-stan-teen, whereas in the UK (where the character originated from) he‚Äôs Con-stan-tyne (like the river Tyne in Newcastle)&&But how do they say his name? &&He's not saying the pronunciation is wrong, just that the character of John Constantine pronounces it the other way in the source material. &&I'm not gonna lie to you... its gonna get weird. &&‚ÄúTell him to arch his back and growl at me... like..

There are so few people who are just ""Meh"" on it. You either think of it as a cinematic masterpiece, or hate it like an abusive step parent. 

I'm in the latter camp, but I do see why people like it. I would totally understand if someone hated Aqua Teen, but to me it's one of the funniest things ever created and a work of fevered, wonderful, genius like madness. So I try not to rag too much on ND, but I do think it's the most try hard boring comedy I've ever seen in my entire life and wish to the very core of my being that it had never been made.

Little bit of Animatting going on there I think. &&I'm still amazed that Tom Holland is the first Spider-Man of any sort that actually sounds like he's from Queens. Like noone ever thought of it before him. In Civil War when he told tossed that bench at Winter Soldier and said ""Hey, buddy! I think you lost this!"", I was like, yeah this guy looks and sounds exactly like Spider-Man should. He's perfect.&&Tom Holland‚Äôs great cause he‚Äôs actually a kid and plays it like the comics did in the beginning. Tobey played college-aged Spider-Man really well. Tobey will always be my spider-man though.&&Yeah I've see this exact statement made a lot.

No one says a Spiderman role *has* to have a geeky school kid juxtaposed with his hero persona. A director has the freedom to reimagine the character however they like.

I liked that Andrew's Spidey wasn't a nerd. I liked that he was into skateboarding already - it played into the athleticism of Spiderman. I also liked that he had a spine as a schoolkid. &&I can't really argue with this... Except I think Andrew Garfield made an ok Peter Parker. &&Garfield was the first (and I'm a life-long Spider-Man fan) to make me realize that Parker was a Bronx kid, lower class, and his sarcasm as Spider-Man wasn't confidence, but bravado, like a cabbie who gets frustrated with traffic but is still a working guy who's worried about his hack license. Maguire felt middle-class, which is how I'd always seen him but I think I missed something before Garfield. &&Lol every time anyone ever mentions a Spider-Man movie, this exact thought is shared. &&Exactly, Maguire is the only one I could really buy as a nerd. Which I think is one of the most important parts of his characterization. Agreed that the writers are doing a great job with Holland's banter tho&&I'm ready for an older Spider-Man. We've had enough origin stories. Let's see him when he's pushing 50.&&It was super popular in theatres where I lived. I knew people that went two or three times to see it. &&Amvs are still pretty common and popular, and there's no point in watching an amv if you haven't seen the thing being edited, the point is to make a fun music video using something you enjoy watching to give it a new ""look"" so to speak for fun.

Even if it is the correct way of saying it, it feel wrong to pronounce it that way. But I never knew that, thanks for informing me&&it‚Äôs so weird that in all of John Constantine‚Äôs live action appearances (my favorite being Matt Ryan‚Äôs portrayal in Constantine and Legends of Tomorrow), his name is pronounced -teen by himself and others. I wonder why producers made it that way when, like you said, it‚Äôs specified in the comics and by the creator. &&So quick question because I've always wondered about the premise of the movie, Rachel's character I forget the name at the moment was so driven to uncover the truth to ""save"" her sister from hell or to at least understand why she would put herself there but in the Catholic faith it's not a given that suicide means damnation it's a very technical and nuanced point but I do believe in her sister's circumstances that the faith wouldn't believe she'd end up in hell. I really enjoyed the movie but just always wondered about that.
Edit- sorry right the question is this covered in the comics?&&Tangerine, Libertine, Quarantine, Guillotine, Langoustine, Brigantine.

It depends on the origin of the word.&&Woooww&&I shit you not, as I was starting to write this response a customer came into work and just responded to me with ‚Äúcool beans‚Äù.

OK, go on: what's the *best* year? To keep things standard for international viewers let's take the ""year"" as being the year of the relevant Oscars ceremony.

Even if it's specified in the comics, it plays no role in anything. Making him come across that way in the movies would be like if you had Frankenstein call himself Fronkenshteen -- it can only be played for laughs because it sounds ridiculous to most people's ears. Or if an American named John pronounced his name like Yown.

I think most of what Kanye does these days are publicity stunts, but this may be what started it all for him. His concern is so genuine, and looking back on it now, it‚Äôs founded and true. The media‚Äôs coverage was completely skewed. The response wasn‚Äôt fast enough. I watched this when it happened and thought Kanye was a lunatic, to my credit I was a kid, but watching it now- 

Jesus, I just found myself emphasizing with Kanye West.&&Sorry Mike, imma let you finish... &&Kanye wasn't wrong though. Hes gone a bit off the deep end but everything he said was true. I remember all the news at the time. Black people wading through a parking lot holding bags of bread? The headline was looters looting.

Hmm...

>I stopped calling her.

>I dropped out of highschool to get a job so I could support us.

These aren't mutually exclusive, sure, but I'm pretty confused: do you mean that *after* you stopped calling her she faked a pregnancy with such huge repercussions for you? If so, man, that's savage. How did things end up for you?&&It also reminds me how ridiculous some of those decisions were: *Crash* in 2005 always gets a mention when this topic comes up but you've also got to look at 2002, 1994 again, 1989... 

The most egregious one, though, IMO, is 1997: *Titanic* made an absolute fortune and therefore by Hollywood's *real* definition was the best picture of the year - but don't tell me it's as good a film as any of the others on that list. &&Generally comes down to etymology. Quarantine comes from Italian, and gets that standard Spanish/Italian ending adaptation, where it's quarantina, and we basically just dropped the final A (as we always do with Italian/Spanish borrows). Clementine/turpentine come from French.

Constantine comes from Constantinus and most logically should be pronounced the way most people pronounce it: Constan*teen*.

Basically everybody except that comic writer pronounces it that way, pronunciation guides will also show it that way.&&This is the gif debate all over again...&&quarantine et.al. aren't proper nouns though...  it's generally out of respect that we pronounce proper nouns/names ""correctly"".  you don't ""have to"", but as you can see people start getting salty (see also gif debate).&&He definitely didn't look 30.&&That was an unexpectedly great interview. Thanks!&&Most interesting thing in that interview for me was that he never gets scripts sent to him. He's created and written all if his yeah success, and not so successful characters. That's a talent above and beyond most. I've heard he's a dick on set, suoer controlling and maybe that has something to do with, but I'm still impressed. &&Honestly man Kanye was a good normal guy I feel but when his mom died I really think it fucked with him and if I remember correctly believe it was from a plastic surgery that he paid for. Imagine being that close to your mom and indirectly killing her. &&> emphasizing

Empathizing?&&I enjoyed the books, I was so excited for the movie...&&Oof that movie actually hurt to watch, and such a letdown considering how great the books were.&&She started acting really possessive and weird, so I broke up with her, but still saw her all the time as we went to the same school and had the same friends. She wound up checking herself into a mental institution and told me that while she was there they did bloodwork and found out she was pregnant. She did so knowing I had recently started seeing someone and was hoping it would break us up.  I wound up working at a Journey's, lifeguarding, and apprenticing as a body piercer. 14 years later I still work in tattoo shops and make a pretty great living at it. Never got back with the crazy chick and she wound up faking a miscarriage on my birthday. Psychopath.&&> Basically everybody except that comic writer pronounces it that way...

That's Alan Moore for you. I assume he came up with that pronunciation just so he can get pissy about someone saying the name ""wrong"".&&this dude. thanks etymology&&> etymology

That's a made up word.&&You mean ""gif""&&That would be heartbreaking. Like, clearly it‚Äôs something he did out of love, too. Most of us would  buy our parents whatever they wanted if we became that rich. I would assume that everything was perfect in Kanye‚Äôs world. Then His mother dies and it‚Äôs like his personal narrative has become vindictive and spiteful. It could be that‚Äôs what has made him so, well- crazy.&&Well he is pretty open about being bi-polar. He probably had issues with it before his mom died but that could have been a trigger for a major episode. Many creative people have been bi-polar throughout history. People shouldn't treat him like a nut case, just be aware that he might have off days, weeks or months.&&Lol I clearly meant I felt emphasis.&&Ehh, the books got progressively worse imo. &&What a crazy story! I'm glad things worked out positively for you though, man: can't have been easy at times, I'm sure.

Bo Burnham's ‚ÄòEighth Grade‚Äô Is the First Movie to Nail Youth Culture in the Digital Age,47574,94vyuj,https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/eighth-grade-nails-youth-culture-in-the-digital-age-elsie-fisher-bo-burnham-1202895674/,2160,1533509360.0,,"The truth or dare scene in this movie was the scariest scene from a movie all year.&&Just walked out of the theater for this one. Probably the most uncomfortable 90 minutes I've had in a movie theater...but its good. As a middle school teacher, the performances from the teenagers are spot on. I think its cool to see a serious take on a bonkers period of someone's life. But fuck me it was so awkward (just like middle school)&&The dads speech to her when they‚Äôre by the fire made me cry in the theater. So happy for Bo&&The way those kids acted is SPOT ON. The dabbing, phone-crazy attitudes. Plus, everybody who deals with that age group knows somebody who says ""LEBRON JAMES"" all the time lol&&Hollywood's really been nailing the youth lately. &&I really liked it. I never want to see it again.

It's honest, and it's honestly difficult to watch much of the time. Not because it's not well done (it is) but because it fucking hurts.&&I have this feeling that Eighth Grade is gonna be this big darling of an indie film for an Oscar push. But I just don't think the Academy is gonna give it much love.

Which is fine. A movie doesn't need to get love with awards to be a great movie.&&Saw it last night. Soooooo awkward. He did a phenomenal job. 

Gucci. &&I loved this movie, just saw it last night. It‚Äôs an honest to god spot on portrayal of middle school life and the effect social media has had on it today. 

It makes me so mad is that this film is rated R. We all know that PG-13 films are often full of violence and sex (often unhealthy depictions of sex) and yet this film was slapped the R rating because... it‚Äôs real? I hate the double standard the MPAA has here and the cultural idea that this film is inappropriate because it‚Äôs realistic. &&Im a 34 year old man and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a movie that I related to as much as an introverted person. &&Even being 20 years removed from 8th grade I thoroughly enjoyed it.&&The banana scene was one of the funniest movie scenes I‚Äôve seen in awhile. ‚ÄúI thought you hated bananas? I‚Äôm pretty sure I even wrote it down‚Äù&&It's not a movie, but I found that the Netflix show American Vandal did an excellent job of portraying how modern high schoolers interact with technology and social media. Apart from a brief bit where it was clear the creators didn't understand how Twitch works, I was never pulled out of the show by any ""fellow kids"" moments.

Excited to see this one, though, especially since Elsie Fisher and I have an oblique personal connection.&&During the dad's monologue in front of the fire, there was a middle age woman a couple rows ahead of me ugly crying in the theater. Never seen that before. She was loud and spasmic. Others were giggling quietly to her response. 

Guess it shows the power of the writing in that scene.&&I suspect marketers will climb over themselves to watch this to 'understand' the youngest of the Gen-Z. Even for myself as a Millennial, their behavior confuses me; and we're supposed to be more in-tune with technology advances.&&Literally just got back from the theater.  People should really go see this movie.  I agree with others that it was awkward and uncomfortable, but that's what made it so great.  The actress who plays Kayla, Elsie Fisher, is great at bringing her character to life.  You watch this film and you really feel like you know Kayla.  Just... please, if you haven't seen it, go see it.&&_Eight Grade_ is my favorite movie since _The Florida Project_, but I think _Ingrid Goes West_ was the first, but that really depends on how they define ‚Äúyouth culture‚Äù.&&As a father of two girls, and a son only a few years away from eight grade, this movie gave me sheer amounts if anxiety. &&Everyone says it‚Äôs really cringeworthy and stress-inducing. Can anyone summarize the weird parts for me? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever watch it but am interested as to why it‚Äôs so different.&&This movie gave me so much secondary embarrassment it was unreal. I loved the movie. It did an amazing job. But man did it capture the anxiety of youth. I was squirming in my seat. &&This movie absolutely blew me away. I didn't think I'd ever have a real emotional connection to a movie like this but the entire experience led up to the most ground breaking moment where it's like everything suddenly became clear.

Not only did it make me feel like I understood how it felt to be in the situations but it truly showed how it traumatizing certain scenarios can be when they ""don't matter"" and that it doesn't matter what the situation is.. it can sway who you are.. It can break you, or build you up. 

There is a scene in the movie where Kayla is rude to her dad who was trying to tell her how cool she is, and should put herself out there... She was rude and ignored him... but the next clip is her making a YouTube video explaining just what he said.

It made me realize that everyone experiences the world a bit differently, and just because we do not see the same way doesn't mean it is any less valid.&&I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, in which I was an eighth grader in 2017. I just saw this movie about two hours ago and was blown away at how relatable it was to me. They really implemented technology well which was refreshing since in most movies aimed at my generation have phones shoved in our faces. Although the awkwardness of the movie was a bit over the top, or at least not relatable to me, I thought Eighth Grade was really funny but got me emotionally invested as well! I would highly recommend giving this movie a try for all people! It can give you some nostalgia or show an insight into the current teen world. I‚Äôm not a huge commenter on Reddit but I just had to let people know about this movie!&&Wait THE Bo Burnham? The same guy who sung ""kill yourself?""&&I saw this movie a second time and holy shit, the awkward and/or horrific parts were just as awful (banana, truth or dare, etc). But I loved every second of it.

What an insightful, hilarious, wonderful film.&&Reading a bunch of these comments, I have to say...I was nowhere near as complex as these kids are these days (or at least how complex they‚Äôre being sold as).  My middle school years were fucking awful.  I got picked on relentlessly.  I was terrified to come to school.  I was (and still am) a huge nerd.  I was a follower.  I had no spine and absolutely no sense self and zero self worth. 

I can‚Äôt think of any examples of people really giving a shit about middle school kids when I was in middle school, and certainly not enough to make a movie about them.

I‚Äôm so glad I grew up when I did.  Had I grown up in today‚Äôs world, I never would have been able to escape the bullying.

Edit:

Also, all of my energy was spent on worrying about school the next day and how I was going to get through getting picked on, no way would I have had the energy to try to paint my life in a certain perfect fucking online portrayal on social media.

I do not envy these kids these days.  I hope they fine their way some day.  I hope we all find our way one day.&&I loved this movie so much. Ive never related so much to a character in any other movie. The depiction of social awkwardness and anxiety was so spot on.&&What I find funny about all this is that Bo has said many times that the movie really wasn't necessarily about youth culture but about himself and how he feels. So I guess Bo is youth culture.&&As a teen going into his sophomore year, I can say that this movie *nailed* it out of the park. While some parts of the movie were over-dramatized for theatrical purposes (girls not even looking up from their phones to talk to someone), the film perfectly captured the son-daughter/parent relationship & the anxiety that Kayla deals with. This will probably be one of my favorite films of all time. &&This was an amazing movie, I'm so glad that I took a road trip to see it.&&I saw this movie and I just graduated high school. I cried during the scene where she says she's nervous all the time and then used the rollercoaster analogy. I struggle with anxiety and am just now coming to grips with it, so that part really hit home for me. I wouldn't see this movie again, but god damn was it great .&&This movie encouraged me to watch LtCorbis‚Äôs uTube videos about middle school.  Boy is she a brilliant 13 year old.  Here is one of her best middle school related videos:

&&Going to see it tomorrow night, can't fuckin wait&&The birthday present scene was the most I‚Äôve squirmed at a movie maybe ever&&It's weird that they compare it to Welcome to the Dollhouse. That movie was *not* sympathetic to the protagonist *at all*. Like, Todd Solondz made the bully who kept threatening to rape her more sympathetic than her.

In his movie Palindromes the first scene is at her funeral where you learn in some completely irreverent dialogue that she got obese, got pregnant from a date rape while in college and killed herself. You're obviously not meant to like her.

Welcome to the Dollhouse is genius in that it completely rejects the trope that the geeky social outcast is actually a decent person, it's truthful in its own way, but I wouldn't say it bears *any* resemblance to Eighth Grade.&&Also the first movie to genuinely make me uncomfortable while watching. I went in the theater only knowing it was made by Bo Burnham, and it was one of my favorite movie experiences. Please do yourself a favor and see this in the theater. &&Cringeworthy: the movie&&[removed]&&I would love to see how high school turns out for Kayla, and maybe Gabe too. &&Bo Burnham is such a talent. Would love to see him team up with Jordan Peele&&Oh Shit a bo Burnham movie&&where can i watch/see this movie?&&My daughter goes off to 8th grade in 45 minutes. Can‚Äôt even think about watching this movie.&&He is an artist&&Phraaaaaaaaasing.&&Bo Burnham said of the scene: ""I have people tell me all the time, 'I‚Äôm so glad that scene didn‚Äôt go where I thought it was going to.' But it doesn‚Äôt need to in order to be emotionally violating for her. I wanted¬†to portray a moment that, when described after the fact, doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal¬†but actually is when you sit there and experience it with her.""

Edited to delete the rest of my comment to prevent spoilers! &&can someone spoil me on this&&The instant it was ""I'll take her home"" I was like ""god fucking damn it"".&&My favorite part of that scene was that a girl who had been portrayed the whole movie as someone who couldn't express herself well was able to give a firm NO.

I don't even know how intentional it was, but I literally clapped. I wasn't able to be that girl when it happened to me, but I loved an on-screen portrayal of someone recognizing when a boundary has been breached.&&The worst part of that was when she asked him not to tell her other friend what happened. &&My heart was beating out of my chest.&&I was so relieved it went the direction it did, but still... hated every second of that scene.

Thought the movie was decent.&&I knew how it ended and I was still ready to fucking scream. I knew so many times that similar things happened in elementary/hs it made me super uncomfortable. Super well done though.&&Just saw this movie this evening. A collective gasp went across the theatre with a few people, guys and ladies, saying 'NO' and 'please say no' out loud. It was my first time in a theatre where you can feel how uncomfortable everybody was, it even felt like the air got heavier.&&I just saw the movie his evening with my girlfriend, and she started crying pretty hard during this scene. It was difficult.

A very similar thing happened to her at the same age, except it did go as bad as you thought it was going to. I just held her hand and tried to help her feel safe as she re-experienced a lot of those emotions.

This is a reality for young (but really all) women, and it makes me so fucking angry and scared for kids I might have one day. We both lied in bed tonight asking how men can behave that way. As a young man, I would never ever imagine pressuring someone that way. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm special in that, so why does it feel like these stories are so common?

It left me walking away from the the theater wanting to do my part to empower women (especially young women) to forcefully and confidently say no. I also want to do my part to teach younger men to understand that they have a responsibility to make the world feel safer for women. 

Ugh, just a lot on my mind with this. Thanks to Bo and everyone involved for portraying this in the movie, because it‚Äôs so real and common and infuriating.&&Yeah. Never thought of it that way. But my partner and I after the movie was like, that was painful but real. And awesome. And perfect. &&Same here! My heart was actually pounding in my chest. It was so different from fear from watching a horror movie. There was this authentic sense of dread. I felt like I was her for a moment.&&The pool scene also felt just like a zombie movie (obviously intentional). What an amazing movie. &&What happened in the scene? Spoilers are fine for me.  Just tag it&&Can confirm. I was shitting myself the whole time. So fucking tense &&i just got back from seeing it in the theaters and three people (an older woman and a separate pair of younger men) stood up and left the venue shortly after this scene.&&You know those films that are really  good but you only see once because of how uncomfortable it is? This will be one of those films. The jokes will also be very dated but it‚Äôs a great film for our time &&I'm also a middle school teacher, and thought it was interesting how much the movie took me back to MY middle school experience, even though that was 15 years ago and the characters have more in common with my students. I think it does a great job of showing how current culture is crazy, but also how it's a heightened version of something universal. Like, I remember more about social media from my middle school days than high school -- it was weirder and less present as a whole, but everything social takes on so much more of a meaning at that age. I'm just grateful it was just weird, random services like Xanga and AIM when I was allowed to go on our dial-up, and not Instagram and Snapchat always in my pocket. Gives me anxiety just thinking about navigating those at that age.&&> Probably the most uncomfortable 90 minutes I've had in a movie theater...but its good.

My reaction to it was ""This movie was fantastic. Glad I don't have to see it again.""&&I really enjoyed the movie, but i spent a large chunk of it with my ears plugged. I have a really hard time with cringe. And there is A LOT of cringe in this movie. &&Yeah. Was there last night. Almost unbearable. Seriously hard to watch. &&I was debating taking my 9th grade daughter to see it. thoughts?  she is very mature for her age, but wasn't sure why it has the R rating?&&I think the movie needed that, as well as the wholesome childish date scene at the end to tone it back down.

Her, feeling like not enough, and him trying so hard to show her how great of a kid she is. I was ugly loud crying.&&Y‚Äôknow, something small that I appreciated in this movie was that every time you heard ‚ÄúLebron James‚Äù in the background, Kayla laughed too. I feel like so many movies about the pains of youth feature a lead character who‚Äôs above it all, mature beyond their years, whatever. I liked that even though she was a wallflower, she was still in the middle of it all when it came to the trends. &&Working at McDonalds, I see a lot of people come through everyday. Kids 8-and-under floss all the time, 8-13 do that fortnite dance, and 13-18 dab&&Haven‚Äôt seen the movie yet, but I played paper football with this guy in home ec, and he‚Äôd keep going LaDainian Tomlinson! whenever he scored a touchdown. Really annoying, but these people totally exist.&&>Plus, everybody who deals with that age group knows somebody who says ""LEBRON JAMES"" all the time lol

As a 19 year old, I feel personally attacked by this passage lmao&&I thought you were supposed to yell ""KOBE!""&&Do kids not say Kobe! anymore? That‚Äôs what we said when I was in high school and that was only 4 years ago.&&We used to say ""Bird for threeee!"" (I'm old)&&Hold up you said LeBron James? No no. It‚Äôs Kobe. You‚Äôre supposed to say Kobe. &&Yikes &&lately? Dan Schneider has made a long career of knowing about fucking kids&&> Hollywood's really been nailing the youth 

Just ask Cory Feldman&&... I can't tell if this is a joke or not.&&So has Bangladesh&&I actually came away very happy and hopeful for Kayla, because 15 years ago I was her. And frankly, things get much much better. &&I dunno how to post spoilers on mobile, so I won't spoil anything, but there was 3 standout times in that movie that I felt my insides turn. 

1. The bonfire scene made me want to die. I've felt the same way she conveys herself to her dad before, and I was terrified as a kid that my grandparents would feel the same way about me.

2. The car scene, for obvious reasons.

3. The final video. Her description of how she feels all the time is exactly how I felt throughout middle school as well. It resonated so much.&&Yeah. Agreed. Reminds me of another A24 film: The Florida Project. Very well received, very ""real-life,"" and with a decent amount of hype, but ultimately little in the way of tangible awards.&&Oscars are a sham anyway.  &&It's too far out for an oscar push imo&&It does seem to have the same sort of path that Big Sick had last year. Let's hope that ends with a nomination for this as well.&&[deleted]&&üëåüèº&&As someone who‚Äôs been in high-school less than a decade ago, I‚Äôd like to see what people around that age being actually portrayed well looks like.

I‚Äôll have to judge it for myself, y‚Äôknow? But I‚Äôd like to see if someone‚Äôs finally done it. (Or at least come close...)&&Honestly performance of the year so far for me. Elsie Fisher is a surefire movie star.&&It's because ""Fuck"" is used more than once I believe&&That reminds me of that showerthoughts post saying something along the lines of ""If Hollywood made a movie about what highschool was actually like, Highschoolers wouldn't be allowed to watch it&&I completely agree with your sentiment. Its absolutely apparent that societal standards and cultural norms for what young people consume in media is changing, but the MPAA system has yet to reflect that change.&&The MPAA has always been garbage.&&I honestly think that kids in 8th grade wouldn't get this movie and you need to be well out of middle school to understand the nuance of the film. It's something that you need to be older to really understand. For me, at least, my middle school experience was awful, and seeing this movie would probably make me depressed. But watching it now, after high school, I can empathize better because I have the power of hindsight and maturity. I see the r rating as more of an advisory of who would get the most out of this film. While I don't agree with the rating, it think it's unintended consequences are really positive. &&I'm a 23 year old man and I was tearing up in the theater when she was talking about how she feels like she has butterflies in her stomach all the time, like before riding a rollercoaster, but it never goes away. I have a panic disorder and I've never felt so close to a character. I already love Bo to death, but this movie was beyond amazing.&&This is what was most exciting about the movie for me. I was her in middle school. I wish I had someone like her to give me advice. I love her attitude towards improvement and self empowerment. I would actually watch her advice videos. They were funny, really simple, and true. She did say ‚Äúlike‚Äù a lot tho...

I want a life advice quote book written by her. &&I found myself laughing at things I was only laughing at because I was 20 years removed&&My SO and I are both several years past our middle school days but what stood out to both of us is how relatable Kayla's character was...most regular people at some point in their lives will struggle with feelings of isolation and social anxiety...but our generation didn't have that experience on full display on social media the way the kids in the film did...&&The movie isn‚Äôt actually about eighth grade-It‚Äôs more about social anxiety, something a lot of people can relate to. &&It brought back every horror I felt during that period, then amplified it several times with how kids have to live with social media. It kind of made me hit the internet.&&I cried a little from laughing at that scene. Her dad was so funny &&I love the camera work leading up to that scene, she's rooting around in the fridge and then the camera pans to the fruit bowl. Oh no!&&The way the banana hits her Dad in the chest was so perfectly funny&&American Vandal is so goddamn good&&Wow I honestly thought the exact same. American Vandal was so well done I felt like a kid again watching it. I've yet to see this one (since it's not playing anywhere in Toronto or online) but this comment really makes me want to see it.&&Yeah. It was terrific. It's to bad it takes more than a few episodes to really realize and I think the subject turns some folks off but it is simply a genius coming of age series that captures what high school would be like in the social media/connected era.&&American Vandal is the most realistic portrayal of high schoolers I‚Äôve seen on tv and it‚Äôs a mockumentary about dicks&&Those are NOT minor tits&&American Vandal was so fucking good. When I saw it popped up on netflix I thought it was a real documentary. And when I started watching it I thought ""oh this is just a big joke. By the second episode I was totally hooked. ""WHO DID IT!?! WHO DREW THE DICKS!!!?!?!"" &&Can someone link a clip of the twitch thing? I can't find it anywhere&&That woman could‚Äôve been me not gonna lie. I‚Äôve been so homesick lately and that scene made me miss my dad like no other.&&I totally cried while watching that scene today, albeit not super loud and obnoxious. I‚Äôm a middle school teacher and I saw so much of myself and several of my students in that scene that it was like a gut punch. Made me almost excited for school to start so that I could give them all hugs. &&It might have been me.  I am a middle aged woman I am not a crier generally, like my friends make fun of me for my lack of crying at movies and shows, but I was full on bawling like a baby during that scene.  As soon as Kayla asked her dad if she makes him sad it started.  Every day I hope that my kids know how much I love them and how great they are and every day I worry that they doubt those things so to hear her say that and know the pain it was causing her.  Ugh!  Right in the gut!&&The future is now, old man&&Fuck, Im 17 and I still can't understand the middle school aged kids these days for the life of me.


EDIT: For example, I keep seeing these kids playing fortnite on their iPads in restaurants and stuff - like I cannot understand how that's possible and its worrying how much of a disconnect from reality that is.&&[deleted]&&There are ways to relate your experiences with them (internally--god forbid we try to *pander* xD )

* Teenagers taking photos of everything? Well before cell phones we always called or sent letters snail mail. They can just do it faster so they do.
* Lily is obsessed with how many likes her post got. Well grandma used to grow roses so she could show off and brag to neighbors, too, showboating isn't new.
* High schooler skipped school--cool, daddy did that a few times too but don't make a habit of it kid.
* Kids watch youtubers now, okay. People used to hang on Oprah's every word and fall in the aisles for Elvis. Celebrities gonna be celebs.
* Watching let's plays = listening to the radio/having tv on for background noise.

Etc.&&God damn A24 is killing it&&For me, Ingrid Goes West could've definitely hit youth culture if they didn't use Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen who are 34 and 29 respectively. 

To me, it seemed more like a Black Mirror episode where they touched on the horrors of modern technology. &&TFP was awesome. &&And it's not a movie, but American Vandal was so fucking real it hurt.&&My daughter starts 7th grade next week, I'm wondering if this movie is something I should or shouldn't see lol. &&It does an incredible job of capturing the awkwardness and uncomfortableness of adolescence. However there is an incredible stressful scene where an older boy tries to get the main character (a 13 yr old girl) to undress via truth or dare. The film is super good though and definitely wouldn‚Äôt describe it as cringeworthy. &&It's difficult to really summarize the ""weird parts.""  The thing about the film that's so cringeworthy and stress-inducing has more to do with the character's social anxiety - she's awkward, and you can really feel her awkwardness coming through the screen, you know?

But if you want me to describe parts that may be uncomfortable in general, message me.&&If you read the summary of the weird parts you'd be like ""so what"" it is just captured so perfectly and is way too real. But there are things like trying to impress boys, truth or dare with older boys, middle school pool party with the popular kids, just all you can imagine about that being awkward, the tiny moments of hesitation, not knowing what to say but still talking.&&It's cringeworthy in the same way that middle schoolers are cringeworthy.  It's really not that bad, just accurately portrays how awkward kids that age are.&&It's hard from start to finish. It's just so relatable and the performances are so realistic. It's rooted in the insecurities we all feel and the pressure the world produces to hide it. I genuinely feel for kids having to grow up with so much public pressure nowawadays.&&Same guy who directed Chris Rock's latest stand up special. &&Holy shit that is an intelligent 13 year old, it's like an adult went back to the body of a middle schooler.

  


How does a middle schooler obtain this level of self awareness. She's woke.&&This girl has a better vocabulary than I do. I'm 35.&&He did a Q&A in LA saying that exact same thing that nothing needs to happen for it to be traumatizing. The entire audience rightly applauded loudly.&&What she says to him when she gets out of the car broke my heart.  Definitely led to a good talk with my daughter.&&I was so sure it‚Äôd go there. I just got out of watching the movie and I was sure that it‚Äôd happen. Best misdirection of the year and amazing acting from Elsie Fisher. She better be nominated come award season. Is it just me or are kid actors a lot better these days than they used to be (outside of some exceptions)?&&I just saw this with my kiddo and her friends. He achieved this goal perfectly. &&Honestly I thought it was perfect for exactly that reason. Every single part of each scene felt important, especially this one.&&That is basically an amazing encapsulating of real teenage trauma.  As adults it all sounds silly, but as teens that shit was real. &&I also don't know many woman who haven't had something at least that bad happen at some point and like Burnham said if you try to describe that to someone after they blow it off because it doesn't sound that bad.  ""Oh so some guy took his shirt off as a dare and then dared you to do it but you said you didn't want to and he drove you home without incident?""  I mean people would be pretty dismissive of that.&&Bo‚Äôs commentary was so spot on for that scene. Seeing her go thru something so many girls that age have made the violation all of us felt feel actually valid &&>!Kayla is in the backseat of a car with a high schooler taking her home. He stops the car, gets in the back seat with her and suggests a game of truth or dare. He inches it closer to sex despite Kayla trying to defuse the situation, and eventually he has his shirt off, trying to get her to take hers of too, and he touches her, making her bark NO. He backs off, puts his shirt back on, gets back into the driver seat and goes on about how he was trying to do her a favor, how now ""her first time is going to be an awful time with someone at a party"" blah blah blah.!<

It's a VERY intense scene.&&>!Basically a high school kid tries to force her to have sex in a car, almost forcefully, then blames her until she feels at fault!<&&Probably my favorite movie of the year so far.  It's extremely well done.  That scene was excruciatingly uncomfortable, but that speaks to how well it was written/directed.  The voice of that movie is so damn sharp.  I loved it.&&Ugh unfortunately in my experience you are special in that way - to me the norm are guys pressuring you. &&https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94vyuj/comment/e3ojszd?st=JKHPROK8&sh=dbb6af96&&Exactly. I was trying to figure out who the audience for this movie was. Even as a teacher (26 y/o), I didn't think it was really for me. Teenagers? I don't think they're going out for the tone of this movie. Parents? Maybe. 

All that being said, it was well done and I think its very cool that it was made and is getting a lot of love. &&Worlds greatest dad is the king of these movies like holy shit it is so uncomfortable &&))<>((&&Scott‚Äôs Totts?&&Like the movie Precious. &&That was it for my wife. She kept tapping me with the ‚ÄúOMG, this is so real‚Äù &&My wife and her 40-ish year old friends went to see it together (no men allowed) and they all felt the same: that it was difficult to watch at times and  took them back to their own middle school awkwardness and discomfort.  It sounds like being that age is difficult regardless of the tools you get when you‚Äôre in it.  &&I think the scenes where she‚Äôs in the mall and hanging out with High Schoolers are supposed to represent the divide between millennials and this new generation, because I really resonated with having a conversation like that in a mall, but nooooone of my students go to the mall, if the local mall is even open. &&Walked out of the theater, said to my brother, ""that was so well done, but now I feel like shit"".&&I'm amazed to be hearing these responses. Movie was hilarious. Of course there were some parts that were hard to watch, but that was kind of the point. I thought it was a movie that they should show in schools to middle schoolers going on to high school.&&I was melting into my chair so low. Didn't know a movie could make me feel so uncomfortable. Loved it though. &&I believe a majority of the R rating would be for swearing, and some sexual discussion. I would say it's appropriate for a 9th grader.&&It needed Olivia (the high schooler) too. I like physically felt my vicarious anxiety lift when Olivia was so nice and cool. &&Although a lot of the movie was obviously about social anxiety, I think the other part was about the hurry to grow up. The first 3/4 of the film were basically about her growing up and maturing within a one week period and then the last 1/4 were about snapping her back into a proper place for her maturity level.&&I just want to find a guy who makes sure I have access to multiple nugget sauces. That‚Äôs love. &&I laughed when she said that.  But it wasn't long before the scene had me crying.&&Am I the only one who cried bc I never had that from a parent? In middle school my dad was around but we didn‚Äôt have the best relationship and I dealt with a lot of verbal and mental abuse so seeing that scene broke me down. As middle schoolers we go through so much since we‚Äôre still figuring out who we are while also trying to put up a front to others and ‚Äúbe cool‚Äù. Whenever I was feeling down the way Kayla was I didn‚Äôt have a trusted adult or anyone who would genuinely approach and reassure me. It would‚Äôve been great to have that kind of concern from a parent at that time. It was a beautiful scene nonetheless and I‚Äôm glad Bo put it right where it needed to be. &&It really does build perfectly to that scene.  The dad finally gets to say what he's been trying to say, she finally hears what she needs to hear.  It's such a cathartic release from all of their stumbling around the whole movie.  This will definitely be the scene that breaks most people.&&Right? Especially at the end with the Rick and Morty bit. 

My brother was probably 15 or so when he first started watching Rick and Morty (how do I know? Why I introduced him of course). And even *then,* I was surprised that not only he watched it but enjoyed it. So I wasnt surprised at the reference in the movie, but it definitely reinforced the whole notion that *everything* is accessible to young teens nowadays in the age of the internet &&It was an incredible movie with the most relatable cast. I knew it‚Äôd be a coming of age movie with an emotional scene and stuff, but damn, I got sucked in. I loved that Kayla wasn‚Äôt above anyone; she enjoyed the same stuff as everyone else but just had such a different personality. That scene when she asked her father: spoilers ahead: ‚Äúdo I make you sad just being your daughter‚Äù had me holding back tears... fuck. &&> Kids 8-and-under floss all the time,

HELL yes they do. I just spent the last week as supplemental camp staff at a nearby museum, and my group was 7-10 year olds. Any time we put on music, they would floss. Doesn't matter if it was smooth jazz or dubstep, they just changed the tempo and how high their arms swung. Everything is something to floss to.

&&I floss every night and dont dentists recommend it all the time? Seems like the younger kids know best. &&Still can't believe Fortnite is finally what brought dancing to white people.&&> Kids 8-and-under floss all the time

What is that?

I swear I'm not old.&&When I was young we'd  yell ""Kobe!"" when throwing anything into the garbage.&&If this was after 2006 then that made total sense because LT was a FREAK in 2006. 31 all purpose touchdowns. To put that in perspective, last year the most TDs a Runningback had was Todd Gurley with 13 and that was considered a lot. LT holds the record to this day.



But I guess this prolly isn't the place for that my bad I just *love stats*&&Wow it‚Äôs crazy, I‚Äôm 24 and everyone I know said Kobe.

I just wanted to give her a hug&&Agreed I felt the same way. Kayla‚Äôs growth in the film was beautiful. I found myself hoping the movie would end with an 18-year-old Kayla digging up that time capsule and recording a new video for her channel. But then I realized it was even better to imagine what a kick ass young woman she would become. Loved the movie!&&Florida Project and Good Time were the two biggest snubs of the year imo. Willem Dafoe should have won BSA and Robert Pattinson should have been nommed for BA.&&Yeah, it's genuinely not worth it for consumers to even support them at this point. They're so obviously a sham that it's not even an edgy statement to call them that. The most attention I give Oscars is briefly reading the list the next week because something reminds me they exist.&&They've rewarded some great films over the years, and are often ahead in terms of film industry trends. Yes, mainstream films are often rewarded, but so are smaller films that need and deserve the attention -- look at Moonlight. &&Kinda, but they *have* gotten better ever since they expanded the number of Best Picture nominees. It's given indie films more of an audience, simply because someone watching the oscars/looking at a nominee list would think ""Well I haven't heard of these 3 films, but they must be good. I wonder what else is good that I didn't even hear about."" Even if all the nominees are actually from large studios, some of those films may have an indie ""look,"" which may help someone pay attention to a trailer from a truly independent film that they wouldn't have even given a glance to a few years ago.&&Maybe like best original screenplay&&Nah. There's usually an early movie nominated somewhere.&&Get Out came out in February last year I believe. So who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&&Yea, though Lady Bird starred Saoirse Ronan, so I'm sure that helped with the Oscar push. I loved Eighth Grade but I could see it getting overlooked since there aren't any regular Oscar contenders attached to it.&&Dang it! Why did I not think of that. &&Yeah, Bo Burnham actually lamented the fact that, in order to accurately portray the life of a 13-year-old in a film, that 13-year-old wouldn't be allowed to watch it without adult supervision.&&Ironically, teenagers swear twice as often as any adults I know.

Funny how as a society we ban teenagers from seeing their own life portrayed accurately&&Yeah, no one ever says fuck, we need to shield our kids from that evil word&&Swear word censorship/regulations are some of the most idiotic aspects of entertainment culture. &&According to Bo Burnham on Fresh Air on NPR, it‚Äôs because nudity of minors is discussed. &&Superbad&&There is no way eighth grade you would have listened to her advice. &&This seems like the type of movie to compare with [Kids](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/). I wonder   if I should re-watch that before watching this one. &&>but our generation didn't have that experience on full display on social media the way the kids in the film did...

I'm 15 years removed from middle school and livejournal was a thing. &&There was a lot of really solid visual filmmaking in this. The tracking shot of her walking up to the house with the pool party, the way it‚Äôs portrayed as so massive and looming because it is to her, or the way when she‚Äôs talking to Kennedy‚Äôs mom how Kennedy is the only one in focus and the mom is just a blur in the background.&&Also imagining the scene from his point of view is so hilarious. Because he just mentioned he thought she didn't like bananas and in his mind she just flips out and throws it at him.

But I also got a genuinely compelling mystery along with it, as well as a surprisingly accurate portrayal of modern high school.&&I did the dicks &&I agree that it's off-putting at the start, but I've seen very few pieces of media that pull off such a massive tonal shift so fluidly.

I mean, I know that when our grade was in MS we were weird but these new middle schoolers are just hard to understand lol. Can't imagine how people in their 30s view us. &&Yea, A24 and Annapurna make all of the good movies.&&I don't think there was anything wrong with them being in that age bracket since the overwhelming majority of Instagram ""models"" are out of high school. &&It was the most overlooked movie of 2017.&&Watch it so you understand!&&Honestly, I would strongly recommend you do if only for educational reasons. While we all remember the awkwardness of 8th grade, Bo‚Äôs film has a really good look into what it‚Äôs like these days with social media.

2. Genetics. 
  
3. She has older siblings, most likely brothers. 
  
4. The internet allows you access to an infinite amount of knowledge,  thoughts, and opinions. The internet can breed fuckups too but if they are willing to read everything it can give an awareness that others might not get.&&As I was watching this I could only think there is no way a parent or much older sibling didn't help her with this. If not she is very smart and well spoken.&&This is so weird but I was the one that asked that question! Terrified that I was the first picked on but I‚Äôm kinda glad I was.&&Bo Burnham doing better than James gunn there&&TRUE.  But expand this to the whole movie, and being a kid in general: In the long scheme of things, nothing really happens in Middle School but in the moment as a tween/teen, everything is traumatizing and everything is a Big Deal^TM. Even dinner with your father who loves you SO MUCH.

IM NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING. &&What does she say?  Don‚Äôt worry about spoiling anything.&&Burnham said that he was shocked with how comfortable the kids were with filming, but that it made sense because they grow up in front of a camera these days. &&Just as bad, in my opinion, is how >!she's made to internalize it as *her* fault, and that *she* was in the wrong for not going along with it. That she should be ashamed for not giving him what he wanted.!<

Just awful.&&It made me and my husband so so so so so uncomfortable. I was squirming, begging for the scene to end. And then I realized... this is the shit kids (and more specifically, girls) go through regularly today. We're both men, so we had a whole different dynamic. Ugh. It tore me up.&&[deleted]&&Damn, looks like we got a r/niceguys here&&This is almost exactly what happened to a close friend of mine. She was 13 and in the 7th grade and he was a senior. Drove her home then got her to have sex with him before dropping her off. He had groomed her for half a year, convinced her that he was in love with her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. The next day he acted like he didn't know her. She was devastated. It messed her up for a long time. Fast forward 20 years and she was a guest on Oprah. She was getting married and Oprah was giving her the wedding of a lifetime. &&Sounds very similar to Hailee Steinfeld‚Äôs scene in The Edge of Seventeen. Same setting, very intense. Anyway, Edge of Seventeen is also a great coming-of-age story. &&The ensuing scene after when she gets home also hurt a lot. Josh Hamilton did a great job.&&I'm assuming as a middle school teacher you're face to face with this every day.  I think the audience is probably adults who remember how awkward middle school was, but don't have to see it every day.&&Bo Burnham said in an interview that the target audience was himself, and he was super lucky that people went along with him on this project because realistically, it's not for the general public.&&As a 30 year old dude, I don't know how, but this movie has resonated with me more than any film this year hands down. &&I felt like I was definitely the target audience as a college student with a brother in eighth grade &&Bo has said in interviews he didnt make this movie with a target audience in mind, but for himself. He's also said that it has a lot to do with his anxiety, or that it at least helped him deal with it &&I (40yo dad) saw it yesterday with my daughter who is starting high school this week. She thought it was a tad slow but we both loved it. I think the audience is everyone over the age of 12. It captures that period of life perfectly.&&Anybody with anxiety &&I think it‚Äôs for me, 

I‚Äôm a dad with a young daughter and I haven‚Äôt been in high school for over 20 years. 

It‚Äôs important that I understand the issues she will face so I‚Äôm better equipped to support and help her navigate through these challenges. 

People forget that while ‚Äúadult‚Äù problems are more complicated, at their age it‚Äôs still the toughest life issues they have ever faced and is no less important as it has lasting impacts on how they view and interact with the world later on

&&For someone with social anxiety, I definitely felt like this movie was for me. I believe Bo also suffers from some pretty bad anxiety. &&I literally had two middle aged women bawling next to me in the theater. I think a wide audience can take something from this movie&&I don‚Äôt really think Bo had an audience in mind. He was making it for himself...so I guess he was the audience?


Edit: his reply to this question:

‚ÄúIt's a bummer but honestly it's fine. And the target audience, for me, is really anybody who feels weird about living now. I didn't write this movie for kids, I wrote this movie for me. But yeah, it's weird that trying to honestly portray what 13 year olds are going through means that 13 year olds can't see it. As if they've never heard the word fuck before. But when I was 13, I was always able to sneak in to any R rated movie I wanted. So go see Mamma Mia 2 kids! WINK‚Äù&&35 Year old parent here. Im debating seeing it with my 14 year-old. Is that a good idea?&&Funny, I'm 30 now, and even though a major portion of this movie is concerned with the era we are in, and how the kids of today use technology - I found the feelings the film was trying to convey were incredibly universal.  I remember how awkward I was and how awkward everyone was at that age.  I could relate to it, recognize a lot of my own experiences in it.  And it was definitely awkward and cringey, but also funny and heartfelt, and really beautiful in the way it portrayed growing up at that age.  I kind of feel like this is a movie for everyone (or everyone who grew up in a middle class upbringing like her character did).  I appreciated how real it felt, compared to most ""teen"" movies with actors who are basically models and usually 10 years too old to be playing the part.  

Guess I'm just saying I think there is a bigger audience for this movie than you may think?  I'm also pumped it's getting a lot of love.  &&As a 27 year old that doesn‚Äôt spend my time with kids like you do as a teacher, I felt this movie was soooo relevant. While technology wasn‚Äôt what it was back when I was that age, it was still very much around and we were navigating it in similar ways. It was fascinating to look back at that very uncomfortable time of life lol. &&Funny thing about that movie. The summer it came out a guy named Kyle (the son in the movie) in my high school who acted the same way and even looked kinda similar killed himself. Everyone canonized him but my buddies and I always joked that his dad was writing his Facebook posts like in the movie &&>You know those films that are really good but you only see once because of how uncomfortable it is? This will be one of those films.

I still really liked the story and I cried when the main character and her dad were sitting around the fire near the end of the movie.&&The musical sting whenever she sees her crush is amazing. It's just so big and instantly ridiculous, but also spot-on perfect.&&Honestly, that phone conversation hit me a bit (before the mall). Middle school was shit for me but my closest friends today are from high school.&&Yeah I felt that too. I was just waiting for the ball to drop and we find out that Olivia actually didn't care was mean. But that never happened. She was always really nice to Kayla and that made me really happy. People underestimate how much a nice and encouraging older person can influence you positively when you're growing up. &&The phone call between the two of them was the first cry I had in the movie. I was just glad to see someone who could act as a strong role model for her. I was really glad they never turned Olivia into a bad person as well, because as soon as the invitation came, I was terrified that the inevitable conflict would be between the two of them, which may have just felt hokey. The eventual result was far, far worse, but so damn effective because we saw that Olivia was legitimately a good person.&&I still had the anxiety because I kept waiting for a reveal that Olivia brought her along to make fun of her with the other high school kids&&What's so surprising about a teenager liking Rick and Morty?

People point to the fact that he hugs his stars too tightly or awkwardly in photos and that a lot of his shows have weird foot-related scenes in them as evidence of his perversions. And sure, MAYBE he has a creepy child foot fetish. Or maybe feet are a topic kids find both gross and funny so they make sense for kids shows.

Every time Dan Schneider is mentioned, everyone jokes about what a pedophile he is. And he could be. But for a site that constantly decries the unfairness of the court of public opinion when someone is publicly accused of sexual misconduct without evidence, Reddit sure loves to make all kinds of accusations against Dan Schneider.

That being said, if something substantial were to come out (not just rumors and opinions), I would not be bothered by people making fun of him. But it's rather unfair to do to someone without actual evidence or even claims.&&Nothing official on whether he abused anyone, but let's just say the news won't be surprising to a lot of people if it does surface some day.&&Beer Can Dan?

&&Cos watching a real kids life would be boring AF to a kid. &&First set was fire tonight üî•&&Damn, him too?&&Never got to see Good Time, but Dafoe definitely gave a good, nuanced portrayal. Can't remember who ended up winning BSA, but I think Dafoe was adequately nominated for various awards at the very least.&&The oscars are just a giant Hollywood circle jerk. &&[deleted]&&Awards shows are always going to be based on opinions anyhow, so I don‚Äôt get the thinking of its rigged. Most years there isn‚Äôt going to be a definitively ‚Äúbest‚Äù picture. I don‚Äôt  know what the last BP winner was that I watched and didn‚Äôt understand why it won. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy every single one, but can I see the artistic value? Absolutely. &&That will blow my mind if Bo Burnham gets nominated for an Oscar. Purely because I‚Äôve been following his work for 10+? Years don‚Äôt remember exactly how long but I‚Äôve been watch if his YouTube videos since he first really came on the scene.

To see this awkward looking kid stand in his room wearing a button down that doesn‚Äôt fit, playing a song that is new, smart, and hilarious - to go to having profoundly excellent stand ups on Netflix (Make Happy - people. Watch it.) to having a movie seen nationwide to an OSCAR NOM?


Man that would be something &&Just not in theater. They can watch it on Netflix or whatever later on. &&Just heard some 9 year olds yelling today

Didn't take much to get hooked - such a brilliant idea and genuinely funny.&&I was wondering when Twitch added private streams and geotags&&I think generations (not all of course) ""come together"" when they get older, making them wider at that point. Gens are narrower when they are young because (I think) young people get more excited and passionate over many and new things. That excitement kinda dies when people grow up and those people drop all the ""new thing"". The gen that likes to do things like dab and play fortnite (I don't mean video games in general)  won't do those things when they grow up.

Young people are almost like their own species.&&My brother is 35, I'm 23, we are both technically millennials. There's a decent sized gap between generations.&&I sound like such an old man, but the middle schoolers are wayyy more technology dependent than I was then. I think an interesting thing is how big youtube is for them - like it was popular for us, but it seems like people such as Jake Paul are giving traditional TV shows for that age a run for their money. Also, the amount of times Ive seen these kids glued to their iPads playing fortnite in public is insane and worrying. Playing a whole fortnite game is public is way worse than checking instagram for example. Im actually worried about what stuff like that will do to them socially - or maybe Im just being ridiculous.&&I have yet to see an A24 movie that I didn't think was great. 

I'm sure there are some. I just haven't seen them yet&&The acting was so realistic that I'm convinced many of them are just playing themselves and are not real actors. I've met plenty of people who act just like them, specially the girl's mom. Like, those girls who act really ghetto and even are aggressive but deep inside you know they don't have bad intentions. &&He spoke on that in a recent interview. Directing stand up is more about technical direction and instructing the camera operators than it is working with the comedian. &&Wow, what a small world. That's cool!&&I was there too! It was so awesome when he explained how they shot every scene the same way whether it was a funny scene or the truth or dare scene.

Everyone over 10 is basically on camera these days (even if apps are supposed to ban them).&&It made me so angry and sad when she‚Äôs the one who begged him not to tell Olivia. You know he was freaking out thinking Kayla would, but she truly thinks what she did was wrong.&&Mmmm, gotta love that delicious emotional gaslighting.

""I'm not the bad guy, you are!""

*Classic*.&&[deleted]&&When he yelled at her for saying ""sorry,"" I felt that in my soul so hard. I was crying a lot during that scene. Oh man, now I'm tearing up. Being a teenage girl in those moments were hard and I didn't always bark ""NO"" when I wanted to. 

He did that boy guilt thing of saying he was doing her a favor, she should've been more grateful sort of attitude. Yikes. All of that scene just killed me. &&That's exactly how that moment felt.  I am sure every woman went through something similar around that age, and it's just as terrifying and awkward as it was for Kayla in this movie.&&What do you mean today? Isn't that basically how it's always been?&&It brought me back to a *very* specific moment when I was a freshman at 14 and this 18 year old senior I was crushing on came over to my house while my parents were at work. I remember making out on the couch and how he kept saying over and over how we should go to my room but I kept saying it was messy so I didn‚Äôt want him to see it... he eventually gave up trying but I was definitely very uncomfortable and lost interest in him after that. &&Indeed. As much as Elsie killed it, Josh Hamilton was so fantastic as well. One of my favorite movie dads now.&&When she was sitting there freaking out and the dad just doesn‚Äôt even know what to do....g dang I legit felt a sting in my eyes.&&Yeah having recently taught an eight grade class this was giving me ptsd&&Sounds like most of his comedy to me.  He is very clever but he sometimes makes me uncomfortable while  laughing. &&Same here man.  There is a quote that adolescence never really ends, it's just interrupted by brief periods of maturity.  I think the awkwardness is just less obvious, but the themes of the movie hit me at my age as well.&&Also a 30 year old dude here, and I think this quote from Roger Ebert is super relevant to what *Eighth Grade* sets out to do:

>We are born into a box of space and time. We are who and when and what we are and we're going to be that person until we die. But if we remain only that person, we will never grow and we will never change and things will never get better.

>Movies are the most powerful empathy machine in all the arts. When I go to a great movie I can live somebody else's life for a while. I can walk in somebody else's shoes. I can see what it feels like to be a member of a different gender, a different race, a different economic class, to live in a different time, to have a different belief.

>This is a liberalizing influence on me. It gives me a broader mind. It helps me to join my family of men and women on this planet. It helps me to identify with them, so I'm not just stuck being myself, day after day.

>The great movies enlarge us, they civilize us, they make us more decent people.&&25 year old dude checking in. Seen 71 new films this year. This resonated with me more than anything else.

It was fun to see what groups of people reacted to which scenes. I was with a group of friends my age, we definitely got the most out of it. The senior citizens next to us hated it. There was a middle aged couple who were loving it nearly as much as us. The group of teenage girls didn't seem to enjoy it much. The mom with her young kids didn't seem to find much of it amusing. 

I still have no idea who the target demo is. &&Same here, also a 30 year old male.&&I'm close to thirty and I felt this movie did a better job of showing my anxiety than anything else I've seen. Not just this year&&I‚Äôm 26, married, no kids, was a pretty popular jock all through school. Oh and I‚Äôm a man. Movie hit me so hard. It was just so well done.  I don‚Äôt relate to the character in the slightest. But everything about that movie felt real. It was great. &&Kind of a niche market &&Agreed.&&So my daughter (13 and in 8th grade) and I (33) both have anxiety- sounds like we are the perfect demographic for this movie. 

&&There is some swearing, a scene where a boy tries to pressure the lead character into sex and some discussions and YouTube searches about oral sex. You be the judge, but I saw it with my 13-year old. 

Frankly, the red-band trailer for *Mid90s* before the movie was worse (f-bombs throughout), but nothing my kids haven‚Äôt heard at school I‚Äôm sure. &&I‚Äôm 33 and will take my 13 year old daughter. It‚Äôs only been 20 years since I was in some of the same situations as her and things have changed so much (so glad there wasn‚Äôt instagram then) but are also SO similar. 

She has severe anxiety issues (same!) and feels like everything that happens is some new hell just for her. I keep telling her that middle school kids were shitty 20 years ago too and that one day it will get better, she won‚Äôt even remember these people, etc., but she doesn‚Äôt believe me. I hope this movie shows her that the middle school experience is awkward for others and shows me anything that I don‚Äôt already know about. She‚Äôs pretty open with me but maybe it will help her open up more. &&Best date movie since *Kids*&&It's cliche but *Grave of the Fireflies* is mine.

And *Require for a Dream*, especially now that I've spent years battling a heroin addiction.

That said, there were whispers for decades about Sir Jimmy Savile in the UK; usually just a nod and a wink from a celebrity and a co-host slapping them in a ""oh, you're terrible"" way.  People mostly assumed, as you say, that he was a bit pervy and maybe some prozzers, right?  This is *Sir* Jimmy Savile, a disarmingly frank working class DJ who'd been knighted for his charity work.

Then he died a couple of years ago and it turns out he was a megapedo.  And a necrophile.  He'd been visiting homes for special needs kids and raping them because nobody would believe them.  He'd been borrowing the key to morgues, because he was *Sir* Jimmy Savile, and fucking the shit out of all the corpses all night.  And dozens and dozens of powerful people in the broadcasting industry were flabberghasted - that people didn't already know.  The attitude seemed to be ""We've been telling jokes about this shit for years and you've been laughing.  And now you didn't know?  This was an open secret when my career *started* and now *I'm* in trouble for it!?""

Christ alone knows the kind of dirt he had on people but he'd kept a lid on it his entire life.  The national fury and impotence at being unable to punish this monster who died a knighted hero led to Operation Yewtree, the paedo inquisition who've since arrested Gary Glitter (already convicted; it was a comeback tour I guess), Dave Lee Travis (The Rapey Cornflake), and Rolf Harris and some other less recognisable figures.

I worry that the current cycle of middle-school kids (as well as the older part of elementary-age children) are beginning to lose the ability to see the value in actual, genuine socialization. Furthermore, it seems that they are beginning to lose touch with reality. Exposure to content sensationalist, click-baiting, low-quality created by people like the Paul brothers and the like is not good at all. It is not how people act in the real world, and I'm worried exposing children to this kind of thing before they can even write will have a negative long-term effect. I'm all for computers, technology, and the internet, but there is a difference between controlling the technology and the technology controlling you. My 10 year-old brother actually thought (and still somewhat thinks) that it is impossible to learn any skill without YouTube. Not that it's difficult. That one *literally* cannot learn to draw without YouTube tutorials. Having that conversation with him was the point at which I realized just how bad the problem actually may be. I'm generally a very pro-technology person (hell, I'm planning on getting A+ certified this coming school year, then plan on going into IT), but I am worried that there is beginning to be a shift in the younger part of out generation's mindset regarding technology, and that it is becoming a substitute for human interaction as well as an example for how to act in real life.

Which is worse&&What was cool to me--or at least how I interpreted it--was that Olivia isn't *that* cool. She's kinda quirky and dorky and probably isn't the most popular. But she's sure of who she is and has found a group that she fits in with. She's comfortable with herself to be friendly, hang out with a not yet freshman, and to tell others when she disagrees. Kayla thinks Olivia is the coolest person ever, but what Kayla is really attracted to is Olivia's self-assuredness. We can see this confidence starting to grow in Kayla by the end of the movie.&&Being open about it helps because I think it makes it less taboo/awkward to discuss.

For example, there wasn't a single eligible musical that was not either a jukebox musical or based off of a tv-show or movie last year. And even more ridiculously, there were only 3 musical revivals in total. They all got nominated for Best Musical Revival because the category is required to have at least 3 nominees. Essentially, if you make a Broadway musical, you have at least a 50% chance to get your show nominated at the Tonys.&&I feel like it's a huge deal when Grammy awards don't follow the charts. But while the Oscars are definitely an inside game, they regularly reward risk taking and distinctiveness on some level or another. The Grammys consistenoy pick the *safest"", most conservative and objectively popular choice, the Oscars often take in critical darlings. Most of it is the same Oscar bait BS or prestige blockbuster, but there's a regularly deviation even in the top prizes.

Basically, I find value in exploring Oscar recognized movies, but I'd rather just casually follow billboard charts than give the Grammys any time of day whatsoever.&&I would argue the Grammys are worse. It's honestly expensive to make even a cheap good movie. You can make a good album in your garage.&&The Oscars are supposed to be about artistic achievement. The Grammys are supposed to be about industry achievement. &&It's pretty clear that the big name awards are decided totally based on who makes the record companies the most money.&&Even in the late 2000s my younger cousins were streaming r rated movies on their computers in their rooms, so I imagine it's even more prevalent today.&&Ratings matter, the rules for them are just outdated. It all stems from when TV first became a thing and all the super conservative people in charge didn't want anything even remotely ""taboo"" to be on TV. The TV world is slowly just now getting over it because of Netflix/streaming services that didn't necessarily have to abide by broadcast TV rules and because the original shows decided to be a little more real, so the streaming world is spilling over into network TV. Hearing basic cable/network shows using ""bitch"" and ""ass"" is something that still feels new to me.

The problem is just the people who are in charge of it are old and/or conservative (not in a political sense necessarily). And I think the problem will persist longer than it needs to because the type of person who's going to be in a higher up position at the MPAA or related organizations is generally going to be someone who wants to keep the rules, not make them better. There's a lot of other things that seem more important or fun for someone who's progressive to put their time and effort into (which is sad since you wouldn't think you'd need to be ""progressive"" to amend the rules of things like ""swear words""). 

I personally think any amount of swear words should be able to be used for PG-13 movies. If they start to include racial/bigoted slurs, then maybe move it to R.....*maybe* (with the exception being black people calling each other ""nigga"" as friends, since that's a realistic and chill thing). I just don't think words are something that should bar teenagers from seeing a movie. &&Haha thanks, it has been a pretty good night, and something as silly as that would never be allowed to bother me.

Without him it might as well be a different sci fi movie.  They fucked up so so bad here and still have a chance to do something significant by admitting they got caught up in this odd mania going on now and with further contemplation they believe forgiveness for a bad past is something EVERYONE will need at some point. 

But they are ultimately an evil corporation so they will definitely not do the right thing&&Disney fucked up so damn bad. Everyone would be over the Gunn controversy by now if they had quietly issued a statement of discipline/disapproval/whatever, and said no more until the smoke had cleared. Kind of like what AMC did with Chris Hardwick (*completely* different contexts but same idea), release a strong statement that there will be deliberation about it or whatever but rehire him officially when the smoke clears a few weeks later.

Anybody that doesn't follow wrestling (most people) probably had never heard of Bautista before GOTG. I certainly hadn't.

As far as Parks and Rec goes, obviously it introduced a lot of people to Chris Pratt and he was a celebrity but GOTG and then Jurassic World are what made him a star.&&Tbf Pratt and Bautista weren't half as well-known as they are now. I do agree GotG2 was probably not what made Saldana a household name. &&Maybe we‚Äôll get Thor 4 with some guardians costars (probably not Bautista at this point).&&I think we will, but worst case scenario it will a different lineup of characters. This was expected to happen, but I did not want it to happen like this.&&I mean have you heard what happened to Papa John?&&Right? Guardians is the franchise that brought non marvel fans into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  There's a reason why the Guardian films are [among the top](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g13441903/all-marvel-cinematic-universe-movies-ranked/) of the MCU, and that reason is more or less James Gunn.

Just saying. &&It is such a strange scenario because Disney is allowing Sarah Silverman to promote Wreck it Ralph 2 and her past is much more controversial than Gunn's&&He can't leave without getting rekt AKA sued.&&it would be the ultimate Fuck You to all the GOTG cast that signed that letter asking for Gunn be rehired&&Yay! Everyone's back! Woo-hoo!

Oh...

...nevermind&&From drax to Killawog(sp)?&&He‚Äôll be playing a new character that Gunn will create for the DC Universe. He‚Äôs named Brax the Bestroyer&&Sinestro Corps War and Blackest Night would be insane&&Can only hope we get an unofficial mixtape tracklist from Gunn at some point.&&Some hack is gonna put in a bunch of obvious, overplayed songs like Africa and Bohemian Rhapsody.&&James gunn writes the songs into his screenplays, which disney is (so far) still going to use. So the songs are already picked and unless the new director makes major changes, the soundtrack will be what Gunn intended&&Unless whoever does the movie gets Gunn to ghostwrite the soundtrack, as though he were blacklisted by HUAC.

EDIT: I mean that's exactly what I would do.&&It's called a Zune and prices are already fucked up since Vol 2 came out.&&""You stole my boat!""

They wanted him to do an ad with a rapper and he said he has a problem with how much that guy says the n word.

He went to his company over the blackmail and Papa John's booted him instead of helping him.&&That's if Bucky comes back. But I would love to see Rocket upset that he won't be able to get his arm. &&One of us, one of us

/r/inthesoulstone&&But Gunn hasn't even been accused of anything. He literally made shitty jokes on twitter almost 10 years ago and now Guardians of the Galaxy is dead.&&He never said he'd bail. He said he's contractually obligated and would ask for his release&&Theyll probably keep the script though. If theyre at all smart about the situation (and i think they will be since they probably know by now how bad they fucked up, and will make decisions extremelt carefully going forward) they wont do something that will make one of the lead actors walk. I dont care what you think. Losing the script and a main character in one go is a huge deal.&&I would pay UFC PPV levels of money to see that match&&Look up Cernovich's AMA, it's amazing. &&> Cernovich

Wait I just googled him....

>Cernovich helped popularize the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory[26] through his blog posts and believes that child sex rings run rampant in Washington, D.C. He has accused his opponents of being pedophiles on multiple occasions, and in a YouTube video maintained that most people employed by the news media and ""every A-list actor"" in Hollywood were also pedophiles.

>In August 2017, the Anti-Defamation League accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a ‚Ä≥blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon‚Ä≥ by Ben Garrison as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.

>Cernovich believes in the white genocide conspiracy theory, saying that ""white genocide is real"" in relation to South Africa. He has stated that he initially joined the alt-right after realizing that ""tolerance only went one way and diversity is code for white genocide"". He later deleted several tweets referring to the concept.

WTF this guy wrote the articles about James Gunn's tweets?

And he accused James of being a creep and an asshole. And this is just a few inserts from the wikipedia page. How the fuck did Disney even believe anything that guy wrote and then fired James.&&[removed]&&He's quickly becoming a reddit-favorite.&&Remember when RDJ was driving around Hollywood high as fuck, firing a handgun into the floor and seats because he was seeing rats everywhere?

I respect the hell out of a man who can get better after that, like Gunn grew as a person. &&[deleted]&&Cracker crotch&&[for anyone else confused and curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEnWGYagMno)

If not two weeks. &&They jumped the Gunn.&&Gotta love the Streisand Effect&&Bautista Lobo versus Cavil's Superman&&As I‚Äôve said before, Dave‚Äôs gonna make a great Killowog.&&Can he also be the narrator of the movie like in Arrested Development?

It's Guardians of the Galaxy.&&He probably cussed one time on the Andy Griffith show so they‚Äôll have to fire him at some point. Better take a hard pass on him to be safe.

NEXT?&&Yeah but his daughter has a real rocky reputation. Did you see her PSA?&&has there been talk of Thor 4? I always figured since Iron Man and Cap aren't getting 4th films that Thor also wouldn't, but I think another film in the tone of Ragnarok would be great.&&Totally agree. He nailed ragnorok, and would be the most perfect replacement. It‚Äôll be hard for someone else to do.

Just really bad luck for Gunn and Marvel.&&Th4&&Asgardians of the Galaxy Volume 3: Return of the Revengers&&[deleted]&&Jokes on them, they already look like idiots for firing him in the first place. Rehiring him would be them admitting their mistakes and would be a big win for them as honesty and redemption and demonstrating that nobody is perfect would be a great inspiration. 

Plus then they'd have James Gunn back for Guardians 3 and all of their problems would be solved. &&They already look like idiots&&They definitely jumped the Gunn....&&I think the first wave of outrage was probably  fake, but if I know anything about soccer moms, it‚Äôs that they will not be very happy about pedo jokes and a guy being brought back around after being fired for them. 

It‚Äôs probably too late.&&[deleted]&&Yeah, loyalty to his friends and built like a Greek god.  &&now i want to see him in a biker show or movie&&And a very small, but good role in Blade Runner.&&His version of going broke isn't the same as our version though. When he's running low on cash, he can easily book a comic convention or a wrestling show.&&[deleted]&&Reminds me of Kevin Smith.  His pitch for Zach And Miri Make A Porno was to say ""Hey, I have an idea for a movie and it's called Zach And Miri Make A Porno,"" and the producer was like ""Yup, done.""&&[deleted]&&I think he means in the sense that‚Äôs he‚Äôs for lack of a better term, ‚Äúdead‚Äù now&&From my understanding, while Xander was the capital of the Nova Corp it wasn‚Äôt the only planet.

Plus some extras from starvation and other things that happen after you decimate a civilization twice.

You think about it all the worlds Thanos manually cut in half got potentially screwed over by the snap because they technically got 2 snaps for 1 unless he was able to only direct the effects of the 2nd snap to the people he didn't touch before....but I doubt it. Think about all the planes that probably dropped because he snapped pilots from planes, or kids that are gonna die without parents.

Did animals get snapped as well? If so, how many endangered species did he fuck over by cutting their already small population size in half. I don't know how well he thought this plan through the more I think about it. But then again maybe I'm just retarded and shouldn't try to think so much about it.&&Well I'm no expert here but since the MCU exchange characters as they please, I wouldn't be surprised if they made Captain Marvel the role of Adam Warlock.
Audience unfamiliar with the comic source could already see her as a saviour after watching the After-Credit scene.&&We just had a genocidal, purple space alien. I dont think we need another so soon after. I echo others and say Doom would be a more interessting choice as we have yet to have a big human / earth born villain.&&James Gunn: ""I'm sorry fans, it was the only way"" &&They didn't change it on the fly, Marvel had been working on deals with Sony and Fox for a while and created contingency plans for their movie lineups in case talks succeeded.

Thing is, I don't think they had a contingency for their parent company abruptly firing the director of their biggest surprise success franchise over tweets more than half a decade old.&&Wait, really? How so? &&...but it rarely makes anyone money.&&N-word&&Guess you can say his dad really pulled the race card.&&Dude there is always a link.

Unless ""free for new work"" means they put a new schedule for 6 months or so from now or whatever. Kinda hard to tell without all the information.&&Tommy Wiseau. Definitely, Tommy Wiseau.&&Disney should just keep Ron Howard on retainer for when they fire directors for petty reasons or replace ones that shouldn't have been hired in the first place&&[deleted]&&It would be easier to figure out ones who wouldn't. Joss Whedon and Josh Trank and Bryan Singer aren't going to get calls.

I think everyone else would jump at a chance to do a Marvel movie. &&I'm sure with all the time he put in at Troma he has plenty of tips and advice for up-and-coming filmmakers, it's cool to hear he is still that kind of guy behind the scenes. &&Totally agree, and it's honestly baffling that they didn't dig around and have him delete those tweets whenever one of the countless instances of 'old tweets coming back to haunt successful people' happened over the last few years. 




























&&Disney's past is more controversial than Gunn.

Disney also just bought Fox who recently ran a pedophile ad for Deadpool 2&&They also have TI in Ant Man who's had a very controversial past as well. This shouldn't matter at all, though, and I don't see why Disney recognises that that's the case with some people and not others. &&I mean, they let Hugo Weaving off when they still had him contracted for more movies when he didn't want to do more than one. &&Sometimes you get that kinda loyalty. Bautista went from nobody to on everyones casting list because of Gunn.&&They might release him from his contract if he feels that strongly, they don't want him badmouthing Disney on the publicity tour.&&Worst case scenario, he just gives them a lazy or shitty performance. You can force an actor by contract to be in your movie, but you can't make him give a good performance when he doesn't want to.&&They would never risk losing that much cash.

Sure they‚Äôre rich as fuck but they love being a billion dollars richer every year &&He could bring life to killawog. I like this. &&Never knew I wanted this until now. &&You can follow him on Spotify, he has a few public playlists he adds to a lot that are basically songs he's thinking about using for GOTG.&&They'll just straight up borrow the Suicide Squad soundtrack&&Well said. Not unknown hidden gems like Spirit in the Sky, I Want You Back, and Ain‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough. &&Also, since Quill has a Zune now they'll add in some underrated 2000s bangers like Umbrella or Hanging By a Moment or Where the Party At.&&While they‚Äôre at it, they should get him to ghost-direct the whole movie as well.&&They need to keep his script and consult with him for the soundtrack.&&She's said that movie was such a bad experience that she almost quit acting because of it.&&Here's [Bautista's Google Trend graph](https://i.imgur.com/ojeB8Sm.png) from 2011 to now. Note the small spike in 2012 around his MMA debut, and then the massive spike in 2014 after Guardians. The movies made him orders of magnitude better known to the general public.&&To people who watch WWE, sure. Just like everyone who watched P&R would know Pratt.

But that doesn't automatically mean the average person (which includes people who aren't fans of those things) would have known who they were. &&I'm not paying for those&&I think Bucky comes back and takes up the Captain America mantle after Steve dies.


I think that happened in the comics, but after everything Steve did for Bucky, that'd be a hell of a way to repay your friend. &&Ah, another child of Banos, I see.&&Exactly, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the, if not the biggest, connection from Pre A3/4 to Post.  Yes you have Dr. Strange and Black Panther and Spiderman but I feel GotG is such a solid trilogy.  Even spiderman relied heavily on the universe with Ironman and the whole central plot focusing on stealing Avengers stuff.  

If the MCU takes a toll for the worst, it is definitely because of this.  &&bearing in mind that at the time, 10 years ago, he was employed as a writer *to write shitty vulgar jokes*...

the guy was literally doing his job. &&Before he he tweeted that (though released after I think?) he did an interview where he said ""Where I‚Äôm at right now is that if [Marvel] don‚Äôt use that script, then I‚Äôm going to ask them to release me from my contract, cut me out or recast me.

One of the short films that was released prior to 2049 focused on his character and it actually adds a lot of development and pathos to Sapper &&I wanted him to win :( I mean, I knew he wasn't going to but still.&&He owned that role. I was hoping he would be play more of a central character, but he killed it with what he was given.

&&That's one hell of a long game. Some Senate level stuff.&&""Mr. Mouse, I don't feel so good."" &&Exactly, this is way bigger than the Spider Man deal. James Gunn was supposed to head up the whole cosmic side of Marvel. With him gone, who knows what's going to happen with those plans.&&Their plan B was probably just getting someone else to do it but they seem to have overlooked the fans‚Äô loyalty to Gunn. &&In February of 2015, right in the middle of production for Civil War, Disney and Sony cut a deal to bring Spider-Man to the mcu. They added him in the movie, and then planned his solo movies. They had a big schedule set up for Phase 3 (the video of Feige announcing it is on YT), that was shifted around to introduce Spider-Man. It is also when Inhumans got cut out of the film side of the MCU. 

This thing with James Gunn is hardly going to matter &&""It's not about the money... it's about sending a message.""

Typically the message is ""because fuck you, that's why!""  But it is nominally a message.&&It was the after credits scene&&You gonna learn today. &&That‚Äôs not major talent though. That‚Äôs just the freelance crew members that would be in prepro meetings, research, writing, etc.  I doubt talent was given any finalized dates.  Also I believe the talent contracts are written so that even if guardians 3 doesn‚Äôt happen, they can bring in the guardians cast for a different movie, like Dr strange 2 or something.  &&Crew members and cast members (actors) are different categories of film-set employees. For example, the crew preps sets/stunts/costumes etc etc for quite some time before scenes can be shot and so are usually on-site well in advance of the cast.&&I did not hit Thanos, it's not true! I did not hit Thanos!

I did not.

Oh, hi Drax.&&Taika Waititi's comedy is so different from Gunn's though. I don't think it would feel the same.&&I doubt Taika would want to scab like that.

He's not allowed to bail, unless he gets permission. That's what getting a release is. &&Fuck me, that AMA is absolute gold&&>alpha STD protection 


lmaooooo&&The Titanic comment is so stupid. The only dispute among passengers is the break. Which is completely logical since we have found out it broke at a very acute angle, and possibly very near or under the waters surface. Some may have not seen it break. &&Exactly this. Cernovich is targeting people he disagrees with politically. This piece of garbage is ruining careers and lives.&&No just standing very still.&&Including the dialogue? That would be fucking hilarious.&&Not just that. But those movies took the guardians from something only super niche comic collectors would know about to an A-list franchise while also allowing marvel to get into the weird and wacky aspects of their universe.&&And was an executive producer of their huge two-parter culminating events as well as helped direct and write the scenes involving the characters he brought to life. Yeah they fucked up&&all they had to do was say ""we're looking into the situation"" and  wait till the majority of public opinion posted online was basically ""oh yea this was years ago and he apologized and has learned from his mistakes""

then they can say ""after discussing it with people from both Marvel and Disney we believe that James Gunn is truly sorry for the jokes he made in the past. We have gotten to know him through his work of GotG and GotG vol 2 and would love for him to continue his work on GotG vol 3.""

&&Especially since it was Disney that fired him and not Marvel. Mickey Mouse basically came out of the castle into the village to dump Gunn. It's wild.&&There's either more to the story that hasn't surfaced yet (but if that was the case I doubt the cast would have taken that stance) or yeah, they royally fucked up&&Me either. The Barbara Streisand Effect was in full tilt here.

Edit: Hey, asshats, if it's not the Streisand Effect, then what is it? Correct me properly or suck a dick.&&I didn't know a single person in real life who knew about the ""controversy"" before he was fired, and I still don't know anyone who agrees with the firing. It reads to me like Disney actively giving alt-right internet trolls power over them.&&Which doesn't even make sense. They are still using his script. They obviously aren't interested in burying him.

I would not be surprised if we see a ghost director situation. If not a complete over rule after time had passed. &&""Only Robert Downey Junior can have a past!"" Disney executives snarled as their female subordinates invented new ways to dodge their sexual assaults.&&HA!&&""I've made a huge mistake.""&&I definitely don't want to say goodbye to the character after Avengers 4, we'll have to see I guess.&&I feel like with his renewed interest the fans feel the same, Thor in Ragnarok and IW have made me want so much more of a character that was really only used for some cool fight scenes and a funny joke here or there in previous films. Especially in IW we get to see how depressing his life is and how he uses that motivation to be a better fighter and such. &&[deleted]&&I've hated Ike Perlmutter since his ToyBiz days, but whenever I call him out my comments usually get brigaded. Did Perlmutter do anything actually good or useful that I'm missing?

Irc the thing is Miller was promised a bonus if he kept the costs within a previously agreed budget, which he did until the studio made changes inflating the bill, so by paying this man his money they would tacitly admit that choices made the studio don‚Äôt affect this kind of clauses.

As engaging as Drax is, 2049 is what convinced me that ye can give this laddie a few minutes and he'd leave a lasting impression.

Truth be told, I'd never have expected that from a wrestler turned actor, but I absolutely love his cameo in 2049. He just sold the scene for me, with or without Gosling.      

Now Gosling can say, ""I shared a screen with Drax Batista!!"".      &&His scenes were really good because the tension was palpable. Very good actor. &&I'd click the hell out of a link for that &&Super same. RIP sensitive muscle bot.&&People would bitch if they did GotG III without Drax.

The entire point is he's insane. He's the *Mad Titan,* his plan to destroy half of all life isn't supposed to be a flawless logical treatise. He's crazy as fuck. 

It's perfectly left in the realm of ""this only makes sense if you don't think about it too hard,"" where he could conceivably convince other crazy psychos (the Children of Thanos) that it *sounds* like a good idea, so it's not entirely unreasonable that he actually believes it and can convince a small group of followers of the same...but it doesn't have to *actually* make sense.

In 2049 under director Villeneuve, he said every single small action was precisely directed: the way he'd move his hand to his ear, the intonation of his voice, how he'd hunch his shoulders, his body movements -- all choreographed to a T by Villeneuve.

Just killing half the population only pushes you back a few decades, as you point out, and you would need to keep doing it over and over forever.

I mean, was Anna Kendrick not available/interested? She'd have made a WAY better Belle. She looks the part and she can actually sing unlike Emma Watson.

Or hell, cast an unknown with an amazing voice. For these disney remakes, people will go to see it just because of the remake. Adding a big-name star isn't really gonna do anything.&&Autotuned (most likely Melodyne'd specifically) Emma Watson was so unexpected I burst out laughing when I first heard it while watching Beauty and the Beast. I thought that's what this article was going to comment on based on the thumbnail, but they didn't.  
  
I *love* autotuned singing for effect in pop and hiphop, and I know the vast majority of good vocals from big artists are treated in Melodyne and similar, or at the very least comped from a large amount of takes to form one super great take, and I didn't expect Emma Watson to be able to sing well on her own, but I was not expecting such a sloppy job in Beauty of the Beast post on the audio.  
  
The pitch correction was so obvious in a couple of spots it sounded completely robotic and perfectly on pitch, which is generally how it sounds when you exaggerate pitch correction and decrease slide for effect. It was very very out of place for the movie.
  
I couldn't stop laughing but everyone else seemed to love it or just not notice it. Writing and producing pop and dance music is what I do for a living though so I'm likely more susceptible to these things. It was just very unexpected for me. I was expecting clear natural musical-like vocals, not heavily corrected and unnaturally perfect near-robotic pitch adjustments.  
  
Beauty and the Beast was overall very funny for me because of that.&&Dear Movie Consumers: please go and see movies without big name Hollywood stars.

There are a million talented theater actors that can sing, but the bottom line is consumers prefer a big name in a movie and thus it sells better. Thus producers are going to keep casting them. &&Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables are 2 of the best West End and Broadway musicals, and their moron producers had to ruin them casting Gerard Butler and Russell Crowe. 

They did so good in other roles. In Phantom, Emmy Rossum was a capable soprano who sang opera when she was younger. They hired someone to dub Minnie Driver. Patrick Wilson at least had Broadway singing credits, and wasn‚Äôt bad. But for the star? Gerard Butler, who never sung. 

Les mis, they get Hugh Jackman, the most bonafide leading man that can sing, for Eponine, they hire a girl that actually played the role in the West End, Sam Barks. Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried were respectable classical singers. But for Javert? A guy that badly sings in his own rock band. As long as Philip Quast can sing, the role should have gone to no one else. Jackman and Hathaway had more than enough star power to carry the movie.

That goodness there are the 25th Anniversary Phantom production and 10th and 25th Anniversary Les Mis productions we can watch instead.

Every movie musical it seems they hire a bunch of great, or at least good singers, but just to add some star power, they all add some leading man or woman that can‚Äôt sing.&&Grant justin and Melissa Benoist were amazing in the flash musical episode &&ABBA's great.

I remember them opting for star power to sell more albums rather than use the original Broadway talent from the movie. In the Aladdin movie, instead of using the original version from Brad Kane/Leah Salonga, Disney went with Peabo Bryson/Regina Bell. I thought the Brad/Leah version was better, but Peabo/Regina amazingly knocked Whitney's ""I Will Always Love You"" off of the #1 spot in the charts. So kinda what like everyone is saying ITT, don't expect Hollywood to change it's ways if they're making money.&&Voice actors still useful in videogames, now if we could just get more musical videogames that don't use licensed music...

Some animated movies try to stack star power but those 3 truly were huge names at the time.

Edit: Wow strong response. I must have been too caught up in nostalgia to notice. &&*and that‚Äôs a good thing*&&Also, there's factors beyond ""can they sing well?"" that go into decisions like these. The writer from the OP seems to have given very little deep thought to the subject. 

I'm a huge La La Land fan, and there's two reasons why Gosling and Stone were picked. First, Damien Chazelle considers them an iconic couple in the modern era. Their on-screen chemistry was well-received in LLL and is a huge reason why the movie's story is so moving to people. Second, he said that he didn't necessarily want a couple who were professional singers/dancers. I personally feel like LLL is supposed to be a universally relatable story about love vs. dreams first, and a musical second. There's an entire arc in the middle of the movie that is devoid of vocal music (besides the John Legend number which is more for narrative purposes anyway). Have a look at Another Day of Sun, where a bunch of ""look we are so diverse"" LA citizens (aka normal people like us) stuck in traffic on the freeway dance and sing about their ambitions in Hollywood. 

And let's be real, a ton of people saw Beauty and the Beast because Hermione was going to become the bookworm Disney princess Belle. 

I think the intent behind trying to get truly talented people on the big screen is admirable, but those in charge will weigh the pros and cons and sometimes fall back on name recognition and other deliberate reasons. &&......""and we're freaking out right now"" &&My gift is my song and this one's for you. &&Walking a bit late into Moulin Rogue at 14 years old just as Ewan belted out the hills are alive with the sound of music is definitely one of my favourite memories from my early teen years.&&He's a great singer

&&I freaking love him in Mama Mia, his inability to sing is part of the charm of the whole movie.

Might as well tap into that ridiculous Broadway pool of talent.

Patrick Wilson has the purest singing voice I‚Äôve ever heard. Jeremy Jordan is also on that level. Actors like them who are Broadway stars are seriously talented and I feel like they‚Äôre rarely used in productions where the talents would be better suited that the ones they end up with in the roles.

Also if the musical fits they can be just fine singers. Like they were in La La Land. Never thought they were meant to be that incredible singers in the script. They were good, and the songs fit their ranges. 

&&*The Greatest Showman* making $435M was absolutely insane too.&&The French movie it was based on had non singers as well so I think it‚Äôs ok to let it slide for la la land (THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG)&&I really enjoyed LaLa land.

A lot of people here made a stance that Scarlett was needed to finance the movie and that hiring actual trans actor would never secure funds and people would not even want to watch such movie.

So, should Hollywood give a chance in a musical to someone new? Or does star power matter even if the actor is not the most talented singer? 

Does name recognition matter? Or is it about hiring the most authentic person for the job?&&Ok. Who among A-list actors has the best voice?&&Agreed!

No. He did take singing lessons for the Phantom movie.&&> Les mis, they get Hugh Jackman, the most bonafide leading man that can sing 

And even then, he was completely miscast because they wanted name recognition.  Hugh Jackman is a leading man that can sing as long as he is singing a **baritone** part.  He is a baritone, not a tenor.  Unfortunately, the role of Jean Valjean requires a very high range.  Specifically, it requires that higher range of E's, F's, G's, and A's be sung very sweetly in the context of a bunch of 6th and octave jumps in one of the slowest songs in the show.  Hugh Jackman was not the right person for that job.  I don't know what his lower range is, but he would've made a better Javert than Valjean.&&I think Emmy Rossum really made that movie. But having her opposite Gerrard Butler really was jarring at times. Especially in something as classic as The Music of the Night.&&Gerald Butler was not as bad a Russell Crowe. He was probably the weakest singer in that movie, but I think the harshness of his voice helped in the portrayal of his character to a degree. Russell Crowe was just cringey bad and everytime he sang, it killed immersion.&&They are, but there are plenty of games which use the same block of well-known voice actors. Guys like Troy Baker, Nolan North, Jennifer Hale, Courtenay Taylor, Tara Strong, Kevin Michael Richardson,and John DiMaggio... they seem to be in everything. Troy Baker even said a few years back, if you are looking to get into voice acting you just have to wait for him and Nolan North to die.&&Every comment is removed now.

It made sense, also it's a Disney/Pixar film and she was already on the payroll. &&> ‚ÄúBolt‚Äù was the one where I really noticed this. Why have Miley Cyrus barely trying, when there could have been a talented no-namer? Do people really go to animated films because of the person behind the CGI?



Advertising a kids movie with Miley Cyrus in one of the lead roles-during the time when Hannah Montana was the most popular kids show in America-was smart. 


Miley Cyrus puts butts in the seats. Many Miley fans who would not have seen Bolt went only because of her name on the poster. Random voice actors do not put butts in the seats. Also I remember Bolt and Miley Cyrus did fine in the role she had.



I think Shrek was the film that cemented the celebrity voiceover trend.

He mimics call-and- response passages, he has a great sense of rhythm, he approaches his solos like he's actually listened to jazz quite a bit in what he ham -fistedly attempts to do with rhythm and movement, but he's just got no clue how to play piano, which is why it's so damn funny imho. I don't even know what the parallel would be with singing- since if you're musical you can probably sing a little, even if your voice quality isn't great.  &&The best album ever made in my opinion.&&And William Hung.&&Excuse you, Gerard Butler is fantastic in the Phantom of the Opera lol&&Crowe can actually sing though, he just didn't suit the role he had in Les Mis. &&Also not a joke: Peter Bogdanovich‚Äôs legendary disaster *At Long Last Love* with Burt Reynolds and Cybill Shepherd.&&*THE* greatest musical all time. It just never gets old.&&""I think this line's mostly filler.""&&She was actually the one who wanted them to write her singing parts out. ""Under Your Spell"", the song sung by Tara, was originally supposed to be a duet, but Alyson Hannigan thought that her singing would ruin her career.

It's one of the reasons that one of her only parts in any of the songs was ""This line is mostly filler"", too.&&Or Dawn who got a dance number instead. &&[deleted]&&It was the... **BUNNIES!!!!**

Edit: :)&&But the Buffy episode was about everyone breaking in to singing so it's ok that they couldn't sing that well. &&Everything about Buffy musical episode is perfect. No one will ever convince me otherwise.&&Actually I saw some of the DVD features and Alyson Hannigan herself requested to be given as few lines as possible (at least she's self-aware lol). Unfortunately, they couldn't cut back on Sarah Michelle Gellar's lines, what with her being the star.&&[deleted]&&Funnily enough, in How I Met Your Mother, she sang quite a few times and she actually was pretty decent. 

What was great about that episode was how diverse the singing talent was. You got Spike and Giles (both of which are actually musicians in real life) who have fantastic voices. And its actually very in character for them to be good singers. Spike love of music had been referenced a few times (most recent example I saw was Harmony burning his Sex Pistols albums), and I remember an episode where the Scoobies walked into a cafe to find Giles singing and playing guitar. Or Dawn whose actress is a trained dancer, its very believable for her character to have be a dancer. Its very easy to picture young Dawn doing ballet classes. 

Then you get the likes of Buffy, Xander, Willow, Tara and Anya, none of which have really expressed musical talent or love for music, and their singing voices were pretty average, typical of characters who wouldn‚Äôt normally sing. The demon didn‚Äôt make everyone great singers. He just made everyone sing. And some damn good songs at that. 

And the musical numbers actually tied wonderfully with the plot and moved them along. What a one of a kind, amazing episode. &&Dawn (Poor Michelle Trachtenberg) was worse. &&And then there‚Äôs Spike who went to Juliard. &&[deleted]&&Ugh i remember seeing a commercial where James Roday says he doesnt see psych ending anytime soon and then literally a week later they announced it will end.

&&There's a scene in *Singin' in the Rain* where Debbie Reynolds's character is dubbing the voice for Jean Hagen's character, but Jean Hagen (the actress) is actually dubbing Debbie Reynolds's character dubbing Jean Hagen's character (if that makes sense).

A lot of musicals are about their own music and story and you want amazing singers to bring it to life. Mamma Mia! is NOT one of those. It's a jukebox musical.

In a jukebox musical you don't want amazing performances - because part of the appeal is for audiences to sing along and dance. There are people who went to see Mamma Mia like 20 times and this is why - it's an EVENT. If the performances were amazing people would be more self conscious and wouldn't want to sing over them.

If you want to hear a good version of the songs... you go listen to ABBA. Not the musical.&&This. Being professional singers or Broadway stars would've made them too good at singing for their respective roles. This way, their songs seemed like they were actually trying to simply converse through song rather than strictly singing, kinda like the audio drama 36 Questions. &&Pretty sure Gosling has always been a musician. He has a band called Dead Man's Bones that to his credit, he never seems to promote through his fame as an actor.&&But one of the movie's best qualities is the chemistry between the two leads though.

It really doesn't go into the problem at all.&&Well he was pretty damn dreamy in that movie&&Twice! Each time going in a different direction!&&And make it a musical!!!

*Obi-Wanna Dance With Somebody!*&&For real, I want to see more Donnie Yen over here. &&Jackie Chan and his Peking Opera classmates can sing on top of acting and fighting, so we should just cast them in everything.&&And they hired a deaf cameraman just to be safe.&&Which is really why it makes for a better rendition. The emotional impact was there in a way it just wasn't in the earlier version. &&Not to mention he sang on the Mickey Mouse Club too.&&It‚Äôs no good diddling kids. &&To be fair, her character was supposed to have the most beautiful voice in the world.. &&Ferguson can actually sing fairly well, but she says she knew that she couldn't do the part justice, so she agreed to be dubbed (by Loren Allred). Ferguson actually sang that first big stage show she has. She said she wanted to feel the weight of the character with the audience actually watching her. Apparently she was extremely nervous and Hugh Jackman was the one who helped her calm down.... yeah pretty good movie.&&I don't know, I assume some of the actors were dubbed over (definitely Rebecca Ferguson), so who knows?

But that wasn't my point at all, I was just saying how musicals were on the up-and-up after the financial success of *La La Land* & TGS.&&Exactly this. I felt the same way, I'm not saying they will be winning American idol any time soon, but their voices very much fit their role and led to a really enjoyable movie imo.&&[deleted]&&I don't know if it's fair to compare Idina Menzel to everyone else on this list. By that I mean she's a tier apart everyone else in terms of experience and choices. She got her start on Broadway and that's a whole other ballpark than just being primarily a film star. 

Also I think her bankable name is primarily derived from her Broadway career and why she was chosen for Frozen. Her co-star Kristin Bell actually has a pretty good voice. Not only as Anna but she was Mary Lane in the movie version of Reefer Madness. 
&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&And Chicago (which she won an Oscar for).&&... and she was a theater girl (West End). If you want quality singers, look to theater. &&Her [SNL singing monologue](https://vimeo.com/206347259) (see 48sec) is a rather appropriate example.&&His acting was impressive and carried through despite his weaker singing.&&Butler‚Äôs Phantom singing bothered me slightly but I was more annoyed that they made him a incredibly handsome man with a bad sunburn on on side of his face. &&This I did not know. I loved butler's portrayl though. &&You can't have a so-so singer employed for what is supposed to be a show-stopper.

Gerard Butler can carry a tune in a bucket, I'm sure, but you need a much better singer to deliver ""Music of the Night"".  

And they could have done him up a little uglier, too.  &&Also, if she is in there, her husband is probably somewhere in the same thing too.&&Matt Mercer too&&How is this so accurate&&This song fuckin bangs holy shit. But what's with all the ""everybody stare at the camera all menacing then just kinda shake quickly"" dance moves

Edit; not joking if anyone wants to hit me with more banger bollywood tracks like this I just caught a bug&&Fern Gully. Came out the year before had Williams and Christian Slater, as well as Tim Curry. &&What a story /u/Kiel297! &&#***STELLAAAAA!***&&never heard it. just listened to first song. 15-20 secs in i'm thinking well this is just some lil swing music it's not bad. 25 secs in. oh i guess he really can't play.&&Paula‚Äôs suggestion that he yell ‚ÄúC‚Äômon guys, stay with me!‚Äù To a bunch of annoyed professional musicians was fantastic!&&Todd Packer was a big fan&&These endless days are finally ending in a blaze!&&I‚Äôm still shocked that they got away with Tara singing, ‚ÄúYou make me com... ‚Äú while Willow went down on her. That scene went over my head as a kid, but when I rewatched it a few years ago I died laughing at that scene.&&Absolutely. Amber Benson has a gorgeous voice. I've gotta say though, Giles's song ""You're Not Ready"" was my favorite from the episode. 

Apparently it's one of the least liked songs from the episode overall, though? I went to a Buffy trivia night and it was the only song that people seemed to have trouble singing along with.&&And they cut her dance number out for time when it's shown on TV. That's kind of a slap in the face.&&His delivery on that line gets me every time I see it. &&I still say that line every time I see Gillian Jacobs in anything. &&[deleted]&&I banged Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom.&&Thank God someone else remembers that line because they cut it later and it drives me crazy that it's not there.&&The best thing about that song is Giles actually guesses the correct answer ""a \*dancing\* demon...no, something isn't right there...""  but then brushes it off.&&That was one of the producers/writers. 

The parking ticket lady was another (Marti Noxin). &&I mean the bad voices make that episode because it was a warlock who did it and everyone is super confused. Amazing episode&&So no one else has said why SMG insisted on singing- the revelation of her having been in heaven and her friends tearing her away is one of the biggest emotional moments of the series. SMG knee she wasn‚Äôt a great singer, but want to have this scene because, ya know, she‚Äôs Buffy, and wanted to act this part. Also she did wonderfully, even if her voice isn‚Äôt amazing.&&HEEEEEAAA-Vun. I think I was in heeeeeea-vun. 

Emma Caufield was amazing that episode, though. &&SMG has stated that she was disappointed with the musical episode, ""Once More with Feeling"", because she thought she'd need a couple extra years to really do the episode justice.&&I believe she was on board until she realized how important Buffy's songs were to the character and her emotional state -- her revelation in Something To Sing About, for example -- and then she decided she had to do the singing herself.&&Yeah, she specifically asked not to have her own musical number in HIMYM (everyone else had them), other than the line in the Suit song I can't think of any other times.&&You know that's right &&Please don‚Äôt play with my emotions. Is this really happening?&&They're making 4 total right? That's what I remember reading. &&I just realized i never saw the first one. How is it?&&Fun fact, they should just bring the show back. If NCIS can run 15 seasons Psych can go on forever. &&***HEY!!!***

*edit:* too many asterisks&&That dance! Classic Britta.&&I'm singing my heart's song!!&&On the commentary track [she called Seth MacFarlane an asshole](https://youtu.be/wun-0XTjCxI?t=260) for making her sing some lines from The Sound of Music. She was barely participating in the commentary until the singing bit came up and then she jumped to attention to yell at him.&&The plot of Singin' in the Rain is that Debbie Reynolds' character dubs the voice of Jean Hagen's character for the musical the characters are making.

But Debbie Reynolds in real life wasn't a great singer at that point, so several of her songs feature other people actually singing, including one part where Jean Hagen dubs for her.

Thus, there is at least one scene in that movie where Jean Hagen is dubbing for Debbie Reynolds in a scene where Debbie Reynolds' character is dubbing for Hagen's.&&That's true, but don't downplay Victor Garber. He has 4 Tony noms, two of which are for musicals, and has been in a few original musical casts including Sweeney Todd.&&Jeremy Jordan originated the leads in *Newsies* and *Bonnie and Clyde*. Neither are as big as Rent obviously, but originating a lead role is a huge deal. &&*Nine million, nine hundred eighty-six* **thousand** ***minutes***. *We actually* sat down *and* **did. the. math.**&&I think all of the Glee cast sung the songs, though later episodes used a lot of auto tune.

I don't remember if Melissa and Grant ever sung together or were even in an episode together though, Grant played the leader of the evil all boys school and Melissa was in the later seasons as one of the new kids after the originals graduated.

My favorite one from Grant Gustin from the show is probably his duet of Smooth Criminal.  You can find it on Youtube.  I don't really have a favorite for Melissa Benoist.  I think she only did one solo song and one of her better songs she was paired with literally the worst sounding and most auto tuned character on the show (Unique), which ruins the song.

The first Season is pretty good overall, though the show went downhill overtime as it transformed into the show it started off as a parody of.&&It wasn't weird! He was just saying he loved his daughter, but not in a creepy waaaaay&&She's a bigger name than Carrie Underwood at the time. Would have called for more pay.&&I remember theater folks being all up in arms when they shot Anne with that close up but man, it was so affecting. She had me in tears too. &&I saw it on New Year‚Äôs Day, feeling a bit emotional and possibly a bit hungover. That delivery was mind blowing. &&Nice! Well said. I‚Äôve never seen a bad performance of Javert, obviously, with the weight Les Miz carries, pretty sure they can cast correctly. 

But I enjoyed a different interpretation of his character. It was nice to see. That movie was filled with incredible performances. So good.

If you get the chance to be in London or New York, check out tickets. It‚Äôs actually hard to get a bad seat in the theatres these days, thru are all so well suited to the space. Les Miz is amazing in person. &&Legit right with you my man. I have the soundtrack saved and everytime I have played it in the best if my mates are around I remind em it's Clooney.

I'm a fucking tit.&&https://youtu.be/aRYsJKdL4VE

It‚Äôs amazing what they did with his voice in Moana. &&It's one of the most over the top auto tuned voices I've heard. A tad more and she'd be approaching Cher in ""Believe"" levels of autotune.

She and the young boy were the only ones dubbed over, everyone else sang their parts.&&And even without proper breath support, Emma Stone achieved a level of emotional fidelity in her singing that many well-trained singers never quite reach.

Hey I'm not wearing underwear.‚Äù&&Ahem, it was a dancing demon. Not a warlock.&&Yeah and it's not like the spell made them sing well, just sing. So you're right it does work. And she was still better than some of the stars in big movies. Or at least wasn't any worse than some of them.&&That was one of my favorite episodes of anything I've ever seen on TV, and I don't even like Buffy all that much.  It was just so fucking cool.&&Ok that line is not SMGs fault.  What a weird sounding syllable to drop an octave like that.   Song writers fault.

EDIT: [Source](http://ellenmclain.net/about/).&&don‚Äôt come for my girl GLaDOS like that. at least GLaDOS has a calming ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. 

it doesn‚Äôt have to be like this. &&Gaston is my favourite character. &&He only half sings you're welcome so it's a lot easier to just correct pitch a bit.  They left his actual voice unsmoothed though.  You can still hear the details and emotion.  He's not singing operatically, which helps a ton.&&The Rock actually has a pretty decent singing voice. He used to do WWE promos with a guitar in the ring & I was always impressed by his untrained talent.&&***BROKE THE INTERNET***&&Don't forget Daisy Ridley! She has a stunning voice. There's video out there of her and Oscar Isaac singing.&&*The point of no return.*&&I love that episode, but it makes me a bit sad to watch nowadays because the whole premise is ruined by smart phones and the mass availability of communication via the internet. One group text and half the fun of the episode is gone. They'd all be Snapchatting their days with no voices.

*Super* creepy though. It's always on my Halloween ""to watch"" list.&&I knew what that would be before clicking. Best joke of the series.&&Spikes was completely in character.  They gave him a punky number.  


But when they had Giles and Tara singing over each other, by far the best one.  Zander/Anya was hysterical, but my god he could not sing.  &&Yep! And if you haven't already, you ought to check out ""Repo: The Genetic Opera"". It's a mediocre movie with a cult following, but Anthony Stewart Head is amazing in it.&&I really miss Buffy and Angel. &&Yeah it was a ""special event"" that took an extra slot when it aired.&&organically*&&No, something isn't right there...&&They definitely put in some auto tune for her. And they got her a voice coach before hand. But I agree. Better than Emma Watson in Beauty and the Beast. The amount of auto tune they used in that film takes me out of the immersion. &&>Song writers

Joss Whedon wrote all the songs, with no previous song writing experience. He mostly did okay but there are a couple of bits where it shows, imo, including this line.

I think the intent was to be intentionally off-putting as befits the revelation that Buffy was snatched from heaven and returned to a life she no longer wanted to live. However, walking the thin line between ""unsettling subversion of conventional composition"" and ""this doesn't sound good"" is a tough act and probably shouldn't be attempted by amateurs. &&Gus, don't be the ribs that flip over the flintstones' car. &&That's messed up, right?&&> üçç

There is a difference between not liking his voice and his voice being bad. &&Even just the ""There you are"" of those little machine-gun thingies (which she also voiced iirc) was so musically spoken.&&The WHOLE REASON I saw Pacific Rim was because they cast GLaDOS as the voice of Gypsy Danger.

That is why the TNG-DS9-Voyager series are so great, that is like 20 seasons of continuity, it's great. &&That episode was so surreal to experience the first time, especially going in dry after missing whole seasons of storyline.

I was actually surprised seeing this thread. It's a critical plot point reveal of the season that ""oh, maybe that was a mistake and Willow is overstepping."" 

Having dissonance in the song during the reveal, even if the reveal is to the characters not the audience, is perfectly in line with expressing that.

First official look at John C Reilly and Steve Coogan as Laurel & Hardy in Stan & Ollie,42765,947st2,https://i.redd.it/tbkulx8y7ud11.jpg,1136,1533284365.0,,"[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I can‚Äôt wait for this movie. For those who aren‚Äôt familiar with their story, Stan and Ollie are one of the only examples of a comedy team during that era where there was never any arguments, hatred, or bitterness between them. There was just pure love and respect for one another, and it seems like that will be a key proponent of this movie. &&I can‚Äôt wait for this movie. I love Laurel & Hardy movies and I‚Äôm certain that Steve Coogan and John C Reilly will do them justice. 

I watched the Solo movie in the old Roxy cinema in Stan Laurel‚Äôs home town of Ulverston, which still operates like they used to, with an intermission so you can go and buy more snacks. 

There‚Äôs a statue of them just round the corner and a museum dedicated to them. It‚Äôs hard to believe that a guy from a small town in the north of England became a global star. &&I need to watch March of the Wooden Soldiers right now&&Somewhere, a casting director deserves a raise.&&Ever since Alan Partridge, ive been hoping steve coogan breaks into a bigger market. Hea sooo talented he deserves it&&Wow! Striking resemblance. üòÉ For a minute there I genuinely thought it was a colored photo of Laurel & Hardy. 

Didn't even know there was going to be a movie made about their lives. I've got good memories watching these two on TV at my grandparents house as a little kid. 

Going to put this on my list! &&That's another fine movie you've gotten us into!&&Did Coogan lose weight for this role? He looks gaunt.&&[Looks even better in black and white](https://imgur.com/tSVAqSI.jpeg)&&Steve Coogan is hardly recognisable!&&One of my favourite pieces of movie slapstick was the scene when Stan is decanting wine from a barrel into bottles... [with a syphon tube...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIw6eRW_Bg)

Starts at about 1 minute in.
&&For your heath&&[Here's another picture from the set, but looks like it is from towards the end of their lives.](https://www.imdb.com/media/rm2527085824/tt3385524/)&&They've done a great job to lookalike. &&Really looking forward to this&&Wow, this has been in development for *forever*. It's cool to see a production still of it. I worked at a company that had this on their slate more than 4 years ago.&&Uncanny, this is a brilliant likeness and the thing that gets me more excited is even before you see this picture you'd have heard the names and immediately thought ""yep, they're going to pull this off.""&&Also now looking forward to watching Rob Brydon try and outdo Coogan's Stan Laurel impression in the next series of The Trip&&[deleted]&&Look a hell of alot better than Tom Hardy as Al Capone &&Dr. Brule and Steve Croogans as Laurangus and Harangus.&&WHAT. Are you serious? I can't believe it. This movie should have been made eons ago. Can't friggin' wait.&&My dad is going to love this. He comes up to visit me in LA all the time for the Laurel and Hardy film festival. &&That's really good casting!&&Hardy's front hair bang is off but otherwise they look great. Hope they do the duo justice in portraying them. Lord knows I'm still going to counseling after that Three Stooges remake movie a few years back.&&Yanny and Hardy &&John & Steve as Laurel & Hardy in Stan & Ollie&&""This is another fine mess you've gotten us into.""&&I might be the unlikeliest person to have watched Laurel and Hardy. 

I was 6 when my dad took up a job in Dubai and emigrated from India. I  had not upto this point watched any English movie whatsoever. My dad did not know a lot ( read, anything) about movies either and got us a VCD of Laurel and Hardy he found in Dubai. The flying deuces. 

Boy was it hard to understand. I think it was the first English movie we watched. And it was Black and White. Laurel and Hardy brings memories of my father's unassuming purchase of the movie VCD thinking it is something people of my generation actually watched. 

I am definitely taking him to this movie when it comes out. &&Yanny and Hardy&&Looking forward to this. My old primary school teacher used to play their movies as a reward whenever we did well on tests or projects. So much nostalgia for movies that were made decades before I was born, truly timeless comedians&&The Laurel and Hardy show was what I watched every Sunday morning as a kid. I do so hope that they pull this off.  &&I can't wait until Coogan lands a roll in the Chuckle Brothers movie&&Yanny &&Awesome! My wife took this photo!

#proud&&Fun fact: In Sweden they‚Äôre called Helan & Halvan. Roughly translated into The Whole & The Half. &&Pumped! Can‚Äôt wait to see Steve Coogan as Yanny. &&Two people  playing two charachters in a movie with the name of two characters. 6 Names in a sentence! Idk man

I just hope this and *Holmes and Watson* actually release this year. Neither have a trailer yet and *Stan and Ollie* doesn't have a release date &&You know its funny cause when I was a kid all I saw of John c Riley was Talladega Nights and Step Brothers and immediatly associated him as Will Farrels sidekick just because I didnt know who he was.

I just love this man...&&Should have been titled ""John & Steve as Laurel & Hardy in Stan & Ollie""&&I grew up watching Laurel and Hardy (reruns at Grandma and Grandpas) 

I'm really really looking forward to this movie. &&Last week, I went to the Laurel and Hardy laugh a thon in Columbus and that was the hardest I have ever laughed. I recommend going on YouTube and watching two tars&&Looks like a dang hunk!&&I'm really not a fan of Coogan, but I'll give him a try with this one. Reilly has never disappointed me yet in anything I've seen.&&I don't expect them to have the actual chemistry L&H had...but by golly they will KILL it!&&God damn I hope that's mostly make up that's making john look that old...&&John C Reilly doesn't really look quite right. But I'm happy to have him there because he's a bloody brilliant actor.

On the other hand Steve Coogan *really* looks like Stan.

Really looking forward to this!!&&My uncle's friend is working in the make-up department of this film. Apparently John C Reilly as an absolute sweetheart but Steve Coogan is a complete bellend. Who woulda thunk.&&That's some damn good casting right there&&While the title is accurate it hurts my brain&&Well I didn't know this was a thing! &&I watched Walk Hard tonight, and kept thinking that John C. Reilly needs to be a lead in more stuff. He's so good.&&6 names for 2 people in 1 title.&&Whoever cast these two for the roles is definitely not getting paid enough. The resemblance is amazing&&I used to live in a house with a laurel and hardy vhs tape as a small boy. Still remember a few of those goofs. Good goofs. Wood shop goofs, painting goofs, they were all gold to me.&&This movie better be good, very good., in fact Oscar nomination good. If you start messing with Hollywood comedy royalty you‚Äôd better be doing the best you possibly can do, or else. That‚Äôs all. &&That‚Äôs incredible. Steve Coogan is the spitting image! &&Wow!  They are spot-fuckin on with that - I grew up a huge Laurel and Hardy fan - this looks great.&&OMG this is perfection. &&In German they are called Dick & Doof - which translates to fat & dumb.&&Words can‚Äôt describe how excited I am for this movie. L&H forever!&&Holy shit, I can‚Äôt even recognize Steve Coogan.&&I hope this is nothing like the three stooges movie. &&I didn't know this was happening but I am. Here. For it.&&John & Steve as Laurel & Hardy in Stan & Ollie. &&Guy on the right looks like one of the chuckle brothers in his younger days &&I bet my grandpa comes back from the dead to see this :)&&Wow, they look great.&&Will Ollie ask Stan Laurel if he touched his drums?&&I know this I'm late to the thread, but after seeing Kong: Skull Island, I really want to see John C. Reilly as Skipper in a Gilligan's Island reboot.

Edit: I before e, except every time it isnt....&&March of the Wooden Solider is one of the greatest films of all time. Those Boogeymen still scare the shit out of me. &&2 guys starring as 2 guys in a movie about 2 guys&&'G√∏g og Gokke' in Denmark&&I was part of part of the focus group that screened this. It‚Äôs a good one. Can‚Äôt say more, NDA.&&This could not be a more confusing title to read haha&&His ""I am alan partridge"" shows are hilarious. When I first started watching those skits my friend from Dublin introduced me to them. I honestly thought it was a real tv show that was just a major disaster. Man he was genius in that show.&&Next up ought to be Gretchen Mol and Kristen Schaal as Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts.&&Great casting&&Of all the comedic duos, Laurel and Hardy were always my favorite.

.....hell, my first set of skate wheels I ever bought were Stan Laurels. I can't remember the company...may have been Birdhouse.

Stan's the man!&&Oh man....Awesome......so looking forward to this......didn't even know it was being made, takes me back.&&Jurassic Park!&&Worked and seen the film, it‚Äôs a really good heartwarming film üëçüèº&&Wow perfect casting&&Wow!  Excellent likenesses!

I'll be interested to see if they incorporate one of my favorite behind-the-scenes stories.

Of course, the two actors were great friends, but when their families got together, Stan Laurel's daughter Lois would not go near Oliver Hardy.  This is because both families would go and see all the Laurel & Hardy short films in the theater, and Lois would see her father being continually abused by Hardy, not understanding that it was fake and being done for laughs.

This intimate and troubling situation resulted in the short film ""One Good Turn"" where Laurel finally gets to take revenge on Hardy:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One\_Good\_Turn\_(1931\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Good_Turn_(1931_film))&&Surprisingly Refreshing&&They look better than Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain playing the parts.&&Looks like Reilly put on a bunch of weight and Coogan lost a bunch.&&One of my all time favourite shows (and later movies) as a kid! The cartoons weren‚Äôt half bad either. &&Holy crap they really look like them.&&That is some excellent casting.&&I always thought that the big dude from Last Man on Earth would have made the perfect Ollie.

Can‚Äôt wait for this though!&&Coogan does a spot-on impression of him in one of the series' of The Trip. &&BACK OF THE NET!!&&Steve Coogan is a supremely talented actor (Reilly ain't no bum, either). A lot of people don't appreciate how hard that subtle character-based comedy is and Coogan is one of the best. Anyone who has seen Alpha Papa or Hamlet 2 will know what I mean.

I will see this film because he is in it.&&john c reilly looks like hardy but holy shit does steve coogan look like laurel.

my parents are probably gonna get down with this movie, this shit is the nostalgia-catnip equivalent of seeing a super metroid movie for me.&&COCK PISS PARTRIDGE&&*Yes! It's an extender!!*&&They had me at John C. Reilly. &&Hello Nicholas, how's the hand?&&[STAN! STAN! STAN! .... STAN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOad90BvvjM)&&Does this look cool? Do I look cool? Do I? Do I look cool?&&Why not Jackie Coogan &&I'm currently reading the Alan Partridge books, really rather good. There's also a fantastic documentary about the development of the character that aired on TV this year, pretty sure it'll be available on the iplayer. &&Yea he's really fattened up. &&Well Stan Laurel was English. In fact in his home town of Ulverston there's a Laurel and Hardy Museum.
&&It's a shame that one man ruined a facial hairstyle for all future generations.&&Nobody thinks of Hardy when they see the stache. It's Charlie Chaplin with the hat and Hitler without it.&&It's a great comedic look when you think of it, Chaplin had one too. But thanks to one giant psychopath it sends a dark connotation.
&&I assume you‚Äôre a 3 Stooges fan, what kind of tension was there between the brothers and Larry?  I liked you better than Curly. &&Also a huge Laurel & Hardy fan here. And you're right. Unlike Abbott & Costello, for example, who fought all of the time. I think the Marx Bros were also very close...but they were brothers, so they don't count.

I believe the biggest conflict between L&H was simply the way they worked. Stan was that Mastermind, script editor and sometimes director of their films. Ollie, on the other hand was just a sweetheart, a mamoth of a man who wouldn't hurt a fly. But he was much more the type to show up do his work and hit the bar. Stan contributed much more to the team but it seems that Ollie was ok with that.

Quick story about the duo. It seems that one of the first times he met Stan's daughter he was still in wardrobe. She began to cry and get hysterical ""You're the man who beats up my Daddy!"" 

They called her but this lead to one of the few scenes where Stan beat up Hardy. Can't wait to see the movie.&&A very unconventional comparison would be Pen and Teller.  &&I thought the Marx brothers had a lot of love for each other, too. &&Thank goodness! I loved their movies as a child. When I watched one during a flight as an adult, I realized that I still found them hilarious. I have a lot of fond feelings for them as a comedy duo and was dreading that maybe there was something terrible behind the scenes. In that case, I would not have wanted to see a movie about them.

So, thanks for the info! Now I'm looking forward to this movie.&&Their stories are actually remarkably similar! Oliver was born in the tiny town of Harlem, Georgia. The old theatre in town has a mural of the duo on the side of it, and they have an annual festival the first weekend in October in their honor.&&I used to work as a caretaker for this church in the San Fernando valley that used to be Oliver Hardy's old estate. My living quarters were above a parsh hall that used to be Mr. Hardy's personal movie theatre ( the old  projection booth, now just a storage room). Anyway, sometimes, in the middle of the night, I swear I could hear audience laughter coming from the old auditorium downstairs.  Really spooky.&&I'm afraid to say I'm British and it's not until a few days ago when the poster came out that I knew he was British.&&We need piss breaks put back in movies. Not for me but for my family who always miss large segments.&&I used to live in Ulverston (my parents live a few miles away from it), it's a lovely little town.  They're very proud of Stan.  The house he was born in is just a regular, normal terraced house.  I've not been to the museum for many years, but there's a letter Stan had written to a fan, and the address is the house one of my aunties currently lives in. &&I did not know any of this, my dad has a caravan there!&&We also have a statue of Stan Laurel in Bishop Auckland in the north east!

He was incredible, that's a severely underrated comedy.&&His role on Curb Your Enthusiasm as Larry's hapless therapist is so funny!&&Were they one of the few comedy acts that lasted all the way from silent to talky?&&My grandpa was a big Laurel and Hardy fan. It's one of the few things I know about him. &&I'm glad to hear this as I thought this was like that late 90s movie where it's just two dudes playing them in a Laurel/Hardy type film like that Three Stooges debacle.&&Seriously, you really need to look at them and then you just start to see Reilly's unique features.&&Funny, my first impression was ""not even close"".&&I've never given so many upvotes in a sub before.

It just came in tv one day and I was like ok let‚Äôs watch this shitty movie. 

Then I was like holy fuck this movie is incredible I gotta see the first one! And follow this Coogan guy!(this was my first experience with coogan, luckily) 

Turns out I‚Äôm a dumbass and realized it‚Äôs not actually a sequel. But still id love to see it again. I wonder if it holds up to my memory. &&Reilly got an Oscar nom, didn't he?  This movie ought to be quite good.&&>Steve Coogan is a supremely talented actor (Reilly ain't no bum, either). A lot of people don't appreciate how hard that subtle character-based comedy is

No disagreement about Coogan, but Reilly in Walk Hard is a masterclass on character-based comedy. I'd argue he's been killing it in this kind of role for longer than Coogan has. 

&&Saxondale is my personal favorite. &&I don‚Äôt know what I love more about the play in Hamlet 2 - just how funny it is, with the songs and all, or the montage with the Tucson Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus singing Someone Saved My Life Tonight, because I love that song so much.

I think at a certain point, Moe stepped in and became in charge of the trio‚Äôs finances, so that Curly wouldn‚Äôt spend it all at once. He was known to be a pretty heavy partier and would show up on set late and in rough condition. Eventually it all took its toll and Curly suffered a stroke.

Shemp stepped into to replace Curly when he got ill, on what was only to be a temporary basis. Shemp had a pretty successful solo career at the time, that he had to walk away from to rejoin with the Stooges. He was doing Moe and Larry a favor, knowing their act would dissolve without a third member, and only thinking he would have to sub in for a few months, until Curly healed.  But that would never happen, and Shemp would learn to embrace being a Stooge again in order to save the team. He‚Äôs the real MVP of the Stooges act if you ask me.&&From rumors I've heard from Hollywood insiders apparently there was a lot of eye poking going on.&&Curly was actually a ladies man before he was in the troop.

J/K. To be honest, I do have a lot of respect for Shemp to take Curly's place when he was the most popular Stooge. A lot of people see him as the spare wheel of the troupe, but he soldiered on and made it his own. It's nice to know that there are people even *nowadays* who admire him for his contributions to the group, and to comedy as a whole.&&Username checks out.&&As a kid, I always thought of Curly as my favorite.  Maybe I still do, but as an adult, I rewatched all of the shorts and I paid close attention to the ones with Shemp.  I found them to be very funny in different ways.  Shemp often got some great lines; occasionally even funnier wordplay than Curly did.&&*Why I oughta...!*&&I'm just now learning that Moe, Shemp, and Curly were all brothers IRL.

Have you ever worked with someone that's great at their job, but isn't someone you'd hang out with outside of work? That's them. 

Oddly enough, these kinds of partnerships can be more productive than ones where the team is best friends. Mostly because they never have to worry about personal feelings getting in the way of their work.&&I'm certainly no expert. I just have friends from the Harlem area.

They'll shoot a movie or a TV show and it'll be like what the show Justified did to Harlan, Kentucky.  It's just a really modest slice of the apple pie that is America.  

I lived there for 5 years back in the early 2000s.  That town is the epitome of laid back, and almost like living in Mayberry (but in a good way.)  I got the best sleep of my life while I lived there.

&&I‚Äôm 33, and ‚Äúcartoons‚Äù for me means 50% bugs bunny/ Warner bros, and then the rest some smattering of Batman/ Spider-Man/ X-men/ rug rats and Doug.&&I remember in the 80s they still played Laurel and Hardy movies and shorts as well as the three stooges on regular tv.  My dad grew up watching those, so like all parents he had me watch them when I was a kid.  &&It‚Äôs also a testament to the necessity of United Artists, as well, because only Columbia and Warner Bros. had taken a swing at the Nazis by 1940.&&You mean, the fallout of it all?&&*Git ova heeya...*&&I think I was born in the wrong era if a dude with a pot belly could be considered a ""ladies' man"" in the 1920s.&&Inch by inch...&&If they are touring musicians, it's probably not easier to pull off. You're with your bandmates constantly on tour. Would be much easier if you just got to show up for work then go your separate ways after the work is done. &&Joey and Johnny Ramone hated each other at the end of their lives. While the band was still together they went almost a decade  without personally talking to each other  because Johnny ""stole"" Joey's girlfriend. Johnny was also very conservative and used to make Nazi/anti-semetic  jokes because Joey was Jewish. They would show up to practice and their concerts, say a few words about what the set list and show would be like and then that's it. The other band members had to negotiate between them. At the end of their careers, they pretty much dug themselves into a hole where they had to keep the band going in order to just make a living and get paid. 

This happens with a lot of bands though. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were on a barely speaking basis towards the end of the Beatles. Kurt Cobain was considering firing Dave Grohl before he committed suicide (actually most people don't know that for the most part Nirvana broke up/went on hiatus right before Kurt died). The dudes in Metallica treated Jason Newstead like shit before he left the band because they still couldn't get over Cliff Burton dying. The brothers in Oasis still are feuding with each other and never seemed to like one another (there is that infamous Unplugged performance where the douche bag brother called it off because he was sick, leading to the other having to handle all the vocals during the show, then the douche bag brother showed up to the concert drunk and mocked him from the balcony). Ever since the Old Dirty Bastardized died, most of the dudes in the Wu Tang Clan don't seem to like or be around each other (with such a big group they have a lot of members who fall into there own cliques and power struggles). Most of the dudes in Slipknot don't seem like they care for each other (especially after Paul Grey died) and most the band's classic lineup is gone. Joe Strummed fired his former best friend Mick Jones from the Clash at the end of the band's career (naming there last album Cut the Crap after he left, Should I Stay or Should I Go? is actually about this). 

Just a ton of shit like this. I don't think most people realize that once a band or entertainment act breaks through to the mainstream/has moderate success, the thrill and specialness of it all just vanishes because now they are basically just running a type of business. &&It's a little different. Penn and Teller are apparently pretty good friends, but they spend a huge amount of time together at work, so they know to have some personal space during their off time. What keeps them from socializing after work is the fact they just spent 10 hours with each other.

Jamie and Adam, on the other hand, would not.&&I know you're kidding, but if you ever get a chance to see Teller do a lecture or interview, do it. He is one of the sweetest, kindest men I've ever met. I could listen to him tell stories for hours. He's crazy smart, and has led an amazing life. I just love him.&&*Slow claps*&&Yeah all three were excellent. Because of them I enjoyed that movie. Although I don't think his name was Steven Seagal ;-)

The thing about Alan Partridge is that at this point he has existed as a character for decades, so he has a whole life story full of ups and downs. It's an extraordinary thing.&&I've only seen the 'Alan Partridge' movie and ""the Trip"" and really enjoyed both.&&Alan: ""Are you wearing Lynx?""

Did you mean (Dean) Martin & (Jerry) Lewis??&&I understand this is all a matter of personal taste, but to me, all those shows you listed are nothing but examples of how people didn't have much choice in entertainment and broadcasters were content to fill air time with absolute garbage.

I think it *might* be on the DVD commentary (or some interview) that the actor playing the SA guy said that when he delivered the lines he did just straight-up say ""cunt"" rather than saying ""can't"" in an Afrikaans accent.&&If you haven't already, I'd *strongly* suggest downloading the audiobook of ""I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan"". It's read by Steve Coogan in character and it is genuinely one of the funniest things I've ever heard. There's also another called ""Footsteps of my Father"", which is also brilliant but I think the former is better. Basically if you need that itch scratched you should 100% get on those.&&Read/listen to his book (better to listen to it as Coogan reads it as Partridge) I, Patridge: We Need to Talk About Alan. 6 hours of classic Partridge that is as good as I'm Alan Partridge IMO. &&I'll certainly give it a watch then thanks mate!&&Ai, there‚Äôs nae porn on it like&&I love how they accentuate this exchange by flashing their armpits at each other&&Oops, yes. Fixed.&&I agree it's a matter of taste. When I think back on that time in my life, my little preteen self was enthralled with all these shows. I'm sure my current self would be critical, but nostalgia's a real thing.

To me, we now have lots of choices in entertainment, and broadcasters are still content to fill air time with garbage. Not that it's all garbage, but the really great stuff is few and far between.

Seriously, so far, the live action/animation adaptations have given the story a happy ending which defeats the purpose of the book being a fable. A fable is supposed to teach a lesson. In this case, it's a warning. Hard to take a warning seriously if everything ends out okay in the end. Yes, I know the book's ending is very depressing but that's the point. So, please Mr. Serkis and Mr. Reeves, keep it as is. &&all animals are created equal,

Orwell was a socialist.&&It's not satire - its the story of the Russian Revolution, Ww1, ww2, and post war Russia under Stalin. Every farm animal is a real life character or group. It's a warning from Orwell that the idea of socialism is wonderful, but very easy to exploit without constant vigilance of the people. &&It wasnt anti-Marxist/Socialist, George Orwell was a Socialist. He died a Democratic Socialist in the UK, but it's likely he didn't advocate for more extreme measures at a time when even Labour was staunchly into the Cold War. 

He even fought in Revolutionary Spain for the Communists, see his book Homage to Catalonia.

I'd actually be blown away if it was in keeping with Orwell's beliefs of Socialism but anti-Authoritarian.&&noted socialist george orwell really disliked socialism&&George Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War you moron.

&&The way you worded this seems to suggest you didn't understand the message of the story.

Edit: July 2019. I still have mixed feelings about this movie, despite its incredible cast...&&I remember commenting on here when both Jungle Book films were announced.

The Jungle Book was always a risky property to produce outside of Disney. With all due respect to Kipling‚Äôs classic book, most people associated The Jungle Book with Walt Disney‚Äôs 1967 animated film. 

Regardless of how good Serkis‚Äô film may be, it is going to be tough to break the association people have with the musical, which is why Disney‚Äôs live action film was so successful. 

I really like Serkis and hope both films work out well for him on Netflix. He seems like a great guy and is incredibly talented. I hope he can receive the recognition he deserves apart from what he‚Äôs achieved in motion-capture. &&This is not true ... is it?&&Suddenly Animal Farm becomes 1984 O_O.&&Well the CIA made a version of Animal Farm to fit their propaganda, so he wouldnt be the first.&&Disney more like.

&&I personally thought the last Planet of the Apes film had a terrible script, it was just insanely well made to the point you almost didn't notice how bad the story was.&&I'll never forget the imagery in my mind when I read the last scene or page of the book. When the leading pigs take control of the farm and they come out of the house and they take to the hill and rise off of their four legs and onto their hind legs to stand, I remember having this image of this purple, dark sky with black clouds behind them overhead, and vividly watching them slowly but surely manage to stand on their own without wobbling. It was an image where I was looking up at them from a decent distance away and on the farm and I couldn't quite make out each of their faces. In hindsight, it was like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse lining up on the hill or on the horizon. Just reading the last scene gave me this imagery and when I was 14 it honestly frightened me in a way that I haven't felt when reading a book since. &&Orwell really fucking hated Stalinists after they stabbed his fellow socialists in the back during the Spanish Civil War. Animal Farm is basically a big middle finger to Stalin.&&Am I wrong or did they take out the anti-capitalism symbolism that was in the book when they made the cartoon?&&> they finally realise the communist utopia is a failure because it becomes indistinguishable from the previous *tsarism*.

FTFY. Russia wasn't capitalist before the Revolution, it was still, rather infamously, a feudal nation. In fact, Marx at first didn't think Russia could be communist because he believed that all nations must first go through a capitalist phase, and you couldn't merely skip a step.&&That's not the moral at all, lol, George Orwell was a communist. 

It was a jab at Stalinist Authoritarianism that betrayed the revolution.&&I saw it as a fascist state, radically evolving into a communist utopia, then slowly and quietly devolving back into a fascist state, the economic policies were ancillary to that.&&Imperialism****&&Feudalism isn't capitalism bud. &&>	indistinguishable from the previous capitalism?. 

More like indistinguishable from the tsars &&""The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.""

Pigs = communist (specifically Stalinist) leaders, Men = capitalist leaders. 'S a good read. &&After a whole book where all the animals on the farm come up with rules where animals will not wear clothes and will not live in houses like humans and how four legs (animals) are good and two legs (humans) are bad, the barnyard animals discover the pigs, who are now in control over the entire farm, living in the human house, wearing human clothing and walking around on two legs like humans. Only they, the pigs, are worse than the original human masters. And the books ends just like that. The barnyard animals realize that they are worse off than what they began with and they are powerless to change anything. 

And it ends just like that. No happy ending. No hint of hope. Just, ""You've guys have gone from the frying pan into the fire.""&&I much prefer Brave New World myself. I think the major flaw in all the dystopia novels is that they place humanity and dystopia at odds, but Brave New World shows the people willingly sacrificing freedom for convenience. 

When reading 1984 it's easy to say ""this could never happen, this is so impossible."" But when reading Brave New World, many of the themes are not just plausible, but relevant. Truth not being *withheld* like in 1984, but instead being drowned in a sea of misinformation and counter intelligence programs. Instead of banned thought like in 1984, a society pushed into such passive nature that bad thought is passified by legal ""happy"" drugs. 

I just, love the dystopia presented. I love the idea that a dystopia isn't something forced onto people, but something that people gradually grow to accept as normal, something they *want*. It seems much more realistic and scary that way. &&Just started 1984 two days ago. Only 5 chapters in and I love it thus far. Can't wait to finish.

Definitely their best for me.&&I love Animals, but it's so short, besides two songs being over 10 minutes long. Plus Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are so damn good too. I know most people love The Wall, but it had a lot of filler on it, in my humble opinion. And it was kind of a Roger Waters solo album, just with the other guys playing the rest of the instruments... 

Kind of like how the albums after Waters left are like a Dave Gilmour solo album. And I love Gilmour, he's one of my favorite guitarists, but those later Pink Floyd albums were pretty lame.&&Ghirahim. &&Listen! &&I‚Äôd like to see that.

Sure, but not heroic&&I think you miss the point....its no so much a love letter to communism as it is showing how a movement with good intentions can be corrupted. Snowball and Boxer AND the pigs both descended from the ""Communists'..the good and the bad. If anything to me its against blind idealogical following, how easily not just greed but need of power finds its way into the human heart and ESPECIALLY the need for any sort of movement to allow for autocriticism and reflection....it celebrates the intentions of the downtrodden that initially pursued communism but I would say it's views of Communism at least in practice are ambivalent at best.&&Except they manage to completely garble the meaning into a anti-communist propaganda, when in reality it is strongly communist (the whole criticism of Stalin is that he is just like the capitalists, and Lenin and Trotsky are the good guys).

Do you have insight into how framerate relates to the actual appearance of lighting, sets, and makeup? I don't doubt it, as I definitely felt it with the first 2 Hobbit films (I got used to it by the third). But I'm having trouble understanding how they correlate. Because on the surface, it doesn't seem like there's relation at all. Nothing has changed with the mechanics on putting stuff in front of the camera. The output is just double the frames.

You are wrong, I've read both the book and the animated movie, the pigs chilling with humans was not removed, but the book ended there, the movie added a scene where the animal overthrow the pigs after seeing no difference between them and humans.&&> DC is even worse.

How so? People literally call the law that stops both of them from entering public domain the 'Mickey Mouse Protection Act' becasue Disney lobbied so hard to protect him. DC haven't had to lobby anyone since the 1998 copyright changes that Disney effectively did for them.

The cartoon version was actually CIA-funded (as was the film version of Quiet American from the 1950s, which put a bizarre anti-communist twist on the ending).

The live-action version from the 1990s had an updated ending from after the fall of the Soviet Union, where 'nice' farmers came along later to farm and presumably slaughter the animals in a way more pleasing to the filmmakers.&&Yeah Orwells work has been used as propaganda against communism for years now while ignoring the anti-capitalist message.&&You're right, but in the final scene of the book the comparison being made is between the stalinist regime and the capitalist societies surrounding it, not the pre-revolution society.

The men we‚Äôre representing the fascist Czars and pigs representing stalinists. Orwell was anti-authortian which is much more obvious in 1984&&It's pretty crazy that a high budget film adaption has never been made.

 I like Orwells 1984 more, but definitely see America's near future ending up more like huxleys version of the future&&I think it is just differing perspectives.

Orwell definitely envisioned a darker future where the state ruled over all, either in a fascist way (*1984*) or in a communist way (*Animal Farm*). His works were all after World War II, and at that time it had seemed like totalitarianism was going to destroy the world. *Brave New World* had come out in 1932, however, as the world has just seen a decade of massive economic boom and the growth of consumer culture, especially in America.

But I agree with you. Huxley's vision of the future is far more realistic. Orwell tended to miss the point in *1984*, as, like you said, he pitted the state against its people. That is not usually how real dictatorships rise, though. Most of the time, totalitarian nations come into existence because of the people's apathy, or the people's desire, and that's the part that Huxley got right (even though *Brave New World* isn't necessarily about the same kind of dictatorship that *1984* is about).

Some other redditor said it best ages ago: ""Orwell believes that what we fear and hate will destroy us. Huxley believes that what we love will destroy us.""&&A Reddit quote that stuck with me on some political thread was ‚ÄúChina got 1984 and the west got brave new world‚Äù&&You guys seem to miss the point: the proles were happy and apolitical, fed by the Party with cheap booze, bland music, pornography and mass entertainment mixed with disinformation campaigns.

But hey, why can't both 1984 and BNW be relevant?&&Haha its the opposite for me, loved Animals, and that spurred my interest in George Orwell and Animal Farm. &&Musically, The Wall does have a lot of ‚Äúfiller‚Äù but I feel like it‚Äôs meant to be listened to as one cohesive narrative, rather than a collection of individual songs. &&Tingle.&&Hey!&&I'm torn.

On the other, video game adaptation movies usually really suck&&Eh, I feel no desire to defend Archer as a character, but   I can see the writers going either way with that or intentionally leaving it ambiguous.

If it's Stalinism he refers to as sucking, Archer still isn't appreciating the book, but saying dude was wasting his time writing a whole fucking book on something that obvious, and reading it was a waste of time too. 

Either way it's clear he's saying the book sucks, it's just one way would be directly and the other indirectly.

My guess would be that with a higher frame rate you're getting considerably less motion blur so any flaw would be more noticeable as it would be a crisper image. 

So if your makeup, set or lighting is off then it would be more noticeable without that blur.

You probably can't use the normal shortcuts like you would with sets and camera shots and stuff and that's probably what Cameron avoids.

Orwell didn't see much difference between fascists and capitalists. Nor could anyone who'd seen how western capitalists had bankrolled the fascist side of the Spanish Civil War. &&Only Jones represented the Tsars, the other farmers represented the leaders and dominant classes of other countries, some fascist, some not.

Animal Farm is about Stalinism, not Communism. The Communists are the *good guys* in the book.&&That's true. It's definitely like a Roger Waters life story, and I actually love the movie.

Her eyebrows will be missed. &&Uhhh so about Robin Williams.... You have been hiking a long time :(

&&What is even live action in it, though? The whole story is about animals. Won't it just be a CG version of the Disney animated film?&&He died working  on the windmill  and Napoleon had the Glue truck come pick him up and lied about it.&&TIL Orwell was a socialist. That‚Äôs cool actually; it gives the ending where he basically says that the authoritarian socialist pigs (Stalin) were just as bad as the capitalist humans they had originally wanted to move past a much more interesting meaning.&&It's explicit satire of the USSR, for sure.

But it's also, by virtue of that, a satire of the sort of logic that turns any sort of revolutionary change into an authoritarian oppressive environment. That it works for many types of oppression in addition to the type it targeted is a perk. (Orwell was anti-authoritarian and general and while this may have been written as a satire of the USSR plenty of his general anti-authoritarianism seeped into it as well)&&In the book, Orwell pretty much says Stalin became just like the capitalists he was supposed to be fighting against. Literally one of the ending scenes is the animals being unable to tell the difference between the humans and Napoleon and his cabal.&&Animal farm is about authoritarian Stalinism, not socialism.&&That doesn't actually mean it was anti-communism. If you read the book it actually seems more like a very damning criticism of what Stalin turned potential communism into. It makes the Lenin parallel (*Edit* Major) out to be a more likable figure than Stalin (Napoleon) and the rest of the story was pretty much Napoleon's path of corruption just like Stalin's. That pretty much explains why the Lenin parallel isn't criticized much if at all. I'm not saying it wasn't anti-communism, because that was definitely there, but I think it was ultimately about how communism turned into Stalinism. But it's also anti-capitalism as well IMO, because of the whole beginning part of the book. Capitalism was failing in the beginning (personally I think Jones was Orwell's representation of unregulated capitalism) and that's why all of the animals rallied behind communism. I think Orwell actually did a pretty good job with the novella in how it tackled a little bit of everything going on historically from that time period.&&It's an allegory for those historical events, but the actual content of the story shows Orwell believed there were glaring flaws with the capitalist mindset as well. &&Literally the last line is about the pigs and the humans looking at each other and it being impossible to determine who was pig or human. The  metaphor is Russia, but the old capitalist system is there too.&&People read Orwell but nitpicks information that benefits their side of the argument. The same way people always put 1 + 1 then the result is 11. The old reddit conundrum that improved health care or worker rights is outright communist ergo thus promoting USSR Stalinist era or socialism is the greatest evil in the world. The EU has a lot of social program and somehow, they're being compared to Venezuela and the fringe cult that keeps on chanting that EU should drop those programs or risk being a failed state like Venezuela. The 2 states are non-comparable but that doesn't stop people from believing. People really find a great way to compare apples and oranges and then somehow a cult rallies behind that idea as if it is fact like 1 + 1 = 11.&&Yeah it was written to be what the guy you replied to just said it was, but in response to failed socialist movements &&Read the book.

It's only 70 years after death of author for works from 1978 and onwards.&&I‚Äôm sure Orwell would be, like, super OK with that&&Time for my weekly Fuck you, Disney, I see.&&I believe [this](https://i.imgur.com/SjkwZI2.png) is the proper way to inform Disney that they can fuck off with their immortal copyright.&&Imo the only real limit could be the life of the artist. 

That seems like just the right amount of time to protect their works and turn a profit off of them.&&Mickey never was going anywhere, but people should be able to watch the old cartoons.&&The company can keep using him all they want- they just lose their exclusivity for the publication/work.  Which means others could release the video cheaply on streaming platforms and discs.  They still control their image as it pertains to merchandising and a trademark.  And any new work will fall under the copyright- it‚Äôs the older works themselves that are at question.

The idea is that by keeping perpetual ownership, it strips society from having the work more freely accessible to everyone. It allows the owner to profit off their creation for a time, but keeps a balance for both society and the creator.  This is one of those areas where corporate ownership breaks down because there is no death or changeover. It can be controlled forever and at some point that ownership isn‚Äôt really benefiting society- is more a way to keep something from social access.

You don‚Äôt see steamboat willie flying off the shelves; it‚Äôs more about control than any real sales opportunity. It will become a bit more tricky with things like Fantasia (1940) and Snow White (1938) as they are some of the more modern pieces people might actually want to see.&&They can keep using their valuable characters and brand and all that. The trademark would not expire. It would just mean that another company (Netflix, or someone like them) could publish the old works without paying royalties. Netflix can publish them now anyway, but only under agreement from Disney -- who may pull those agreements in the near future when they want to promote their own streaming service.

How long should royalties last? The constitution specified that it should be ""limited"", but it has been extended over and over again. The original federal copyright law allowed for 14 years, plus a 14 year extension.

Why is endless copyright bad? If it weren't for things entering the public domain, there would be none of the original Disney princess movies, or a ton of other stuff, because most of them are based on stories that predate copyright. Having our collective culture become public after a very long time is a good thing -- it allows for companies (like Disney) to make money by distributing them in new ways. If copyright was much shorter (say, the original 14-28) music and video streaming services would have much higher competition since they'd be able to make use of an enormous back catalog. You'd need to sign up for fewer services. They'd need to spend less money either allowing them to invest in new content or lower prices.

There's also the issue that many old works cannot be secured *at all* because the original owners cannot be found to make licensing arrangements -- but it is still illegal to distribute them. This was a case that went to the Supreme Court because Project Gutenberg was unable to add abandoned but copyrighted works to their catalog.
&&The irony is that Disney built itself off of reimagining public domain stories.&&Think access not fair use. You can get a free version of a 1920s cartoon once it enters into the public domain. &&Because a company cant create anything. People can. The people that created Mickey Mouse are long dead. We no longer need to look after their interests at the expense of furthering the public. Imagine being able to publish animal farm for free online so that everyone can enjoy it. Alternatively, imagine if conservatories were having their renditions of Mozart taken down from youtube for copyright. Other relevant copyright laws involve patents on medicine or technology that may help move the world forward.  Profits are not the only consideration.&&You should read up about the basics of public domain.

Disney came into popularity in the early 20th century because they used the decades or even centuries old stories that were in public domain to their own benefit. But for some reason, they don't want others do do it with their own creations.

Imagine if the copyright owners of  Snow White, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Tangled, Mulan, Frozen, didn't gave permission to disney when it first started. Disney as a company would cease to exist today. (there mostly aren't that many as many of these stories are culturally told by people over many generations but if we had this kind of lifetime copyright proposals then would you be okay with a 300-400 years of exclusivity over the above stories? )
 
Keep in mind, I am not against copyrights. I am all for it as long as the creator of the said IP lives. But after that, these should enter public domain so that other people could make derivative or copy it for their own reasons. &&This isn't a copyright of the character, it's a copyright of the specific work that character is in. Steamboat Willy for example cannot be used publicly without Disney's permission. Disney will always own the rights to its characters as an asset of that company. Individual creative works will fall into the domain. &&I don't get this either. They are obviously still using these characters. It's not like Disney abandoned Mickey Mouse and hasn't used him for 50 years, and then decided last minute they wanted to keep him. They've been actively using him the entire time.&&Because our culture benefits when things enter public domain.  Think of all the books/movies/shows etc based on Shakespeare's works.  We wouldn't have any of them if the Shakespeare estate still owned his stuff.&&It would be very restrictive if cultural works like classical music were continuously under copyright protection. A lot of our media utilizes these works without being made to pay for them, which allows our art and culture to be enhanced without the issue of who owns it.&&They do get to keep them, for ~~75~~ 95 years, which is more than enough.

The irony is that Disney literally probably wouldn't even exist today without Public Domain. Should the descendants of Shakespeare or The Brothers Grimm still own their works with everyone needing their permission to use them?

Not having the public domain would severely limit creative freedom and just allow these faceless mega corporations to continue to stockpile IP for all of time. That's just insanity to me.

Edit: Apparently people actually WANT these corporations to just be able to horde IP's for all time. Did I wake up in bizarro world? People are literally defending these faceless corporations rights to own everything in complete perpetuity. That just seems completely bonkers to me. Hail corporate I guess.&&Disney stolen works from public domain then created perpetual copyright to prevent future generations from enjoying same work. 


Snow White. Sleeping beauty. Aladdin. Little Mermaid. 

Those are all public domain works stolen by  Disney. &&> A 20 year copyright would mean that GoT is already public domain, while he's still hasn't finished the 6th book. I'm not against shorter protections, but I just thought that was kind of funny. 

Only the first book would be, while the rest would still be under GRRM's copyright. Any large adaptation would still have to deal with him, as it would be hard to properly continue the series without infringing on the newer books. &&I agree though, Netflix promotes a lot of shit content &&Thanks for letting me know this, I was going to watch it this weekend now I won't have to.&&he's the weakest part of every movie he's in. he's passable in the ant man movies but god is he unwatchable in extinction. he couldn't emote if he were shot in the foot&&""You just made an enemy for life!""&&Yep, the humans are supposed to symbolize capitalism, and the point of the ending is that you can't tell the difference between the Stalinists and the capitalists.

Interesting man of the age, every other writer in the UK and the West I've heard never bothered with other classes and they were out of touch unlike Orwell who spent multiple years just to experience what others did.&&It is true although Mr. Jones was not a capitalist. He was a stand in for the Czar of Russia, who despite what people are saying in this thread was not a capitalist.&&It 100% works as that because Orwell spoke to that later on as well. I'm simply saying it has nothing to do with capitalism. Anti-totalitarianism, anti-dictatorship, sure. And again, Orwell likely was, as a socialist, not on board with capitalism. That doesn't mean that's what this particular book was about, is all I would say. &&Snowball was Trotsky, Major was a Lenin/Marx hybrid.&&Isn't Snowball supposed to be Trotsky?&&I‚Äôm not sure about Capitalism. More absolute monarchy.

The farmer is meant to be the Tsar and the white army, then later the Nazis when they blow up the windmill is the destruction and death in the USSR in WWII.

&&It's literally pointing out how the pigs (people who revolted) ended up becoming the very thing (in this case humans or Nicholas II) that they revolted against. People keep repeating this line as if that's signalling capitalism. It's literally saying they ended up becoming the monsters they thought they were rebelling against.&&I own the book. And again, it's a nice thought exercise to take a book and sort of apply it to current day. What does not change however is what Orwell said and what is obvious: it was a satirical allegory of the soviet union, of Stalin's totalitarianism and communism. 

Mr. Jones is Nicholas II

Napoleon is Stalin

Snowball is Trotsky

Old Major is Marx or Lenin or both. 

It is undeniably about one thing. If people take different meanings of course that is fine. But if people read Animal Farm and take away anti-capitalist meaning, they are simply applying their own beliefs into something not intended as such. &&Most likely. I don't see corporations giving up century plus old iconic characters. Although Disney uses the public domain in most of their works with fairytale characters. Maybe others will get the same opportunity with their original characters. &&The character Mickey Mouse will never enter the public domain.

They'd simply lose the right to demand royalties for publishing their old works.&&Because the whole point of copyright is to encourage creativity. At a certain point works are supposed to enter public domain to that new stories with those characters can be told by a new generation. Disney can keep making stories with those characters, but they shouldn't be able to stop others in perpetuity. &&I don‚Äôt know man, they‚Äôve been making new content with their IP that whole entire time. They never stopped making Superman stories for 100 years, it‚Äôs been nonstop. Of course they should get to keep making Superman stories. &&> Did I wake up in bizarro world?

No, you woke up to sponsored posters. It's cool. I heard that Disney is paying out big on Hamlet royalties for the Lion King.&&They are not ‚Äúlocked up,‚Äù Anyone that wants to make their own works on those same stories is allowed to do that now.

And Orwell came back from the War disillusioned, and he would draw on his experience there in both Animal Farm and 1984.&&I think this is because when criticizing totalitarism and the USSR for example, it's very difficult not to fall into one of the side that either ""USSR wasn't real communism"" or that ""USSR is the ultimate proof that communism doesn't work"".

Autoritarian regimes have existed before and after the USSR, in countries that didn't even claimed to be communist. And many countries have socialised a part of their economy and have gained benefits from doing so. But that doesn't mean that communist ideologies aren't very prone to a cult of personnality and a strong coercive state. Historically, there's a strong correlation. So we should acknowledge this by implementing what's good in communism without giving up on democracy or individual rights.

But I feel like those subjects are so tainted that it's impossible to have a nuanced debate about it. Hell, people can't have a nuance debate on most subjects in politics today.&&Woah I typed Snowball and meant Napoleon lol. I'll fix it. And yeah when he peed on them I thought that meant he had destroyed them but I suppose it's up to interpretation.

It's an honest book and very much worth reading. It's one of those books that embodies what makes literature so great to me.

Capitalism is a way to handle resources. It can exist both in a monarchy and in republic -- and not always to the same extend dependant on what areas are opened to it. (Eg. is it ok to set a market price to medicine, to land, to rents.)&&I interpreted the humans in general as being the keepers of the older capitalist system (with each farm being a state). For sure there‚Äôs many interpretations.&&The book does not have a positive view of the farmers, who are capitalists. The pigs descent into totalitarianism is marked as them acting more and more like the farmers (standing on two legs, smoking cigars, drinking alcohol, ruthless exploitation of labor, etc.). &&>I'm simply saying it has nothing to do with capitalism.

I think the beginning part of the book paralleled capitalism far more than it did pre-Russian Revolution Russia. But that's just my take on it. If you know Orwell's opinion on capitalism it makes a lot more sense if it's set up that way.&&I'm not at all sympathetic to Disney, but it doesn't seem to make sense to me for a character *like* Mickey (could be any example) to enter public domain while the company that created it still exists and is using it.

A work that was created by a singular entity (e.g. author, musician, artist), or at least a very small group of ownership (e.g. band), or a *defunct* company, yes, it would make sense to me that that work should enter public domain after a reasonable amount of time for the creator to capitalize on it.  

Personally life + a certain amount of years seems reasonable.  I'm selfish and not nearly egalitarian or communal enough to think that if I came up with a popular character or work that I'd be happy forcibly giving up control during my lifetime.  I suppose it's more of a philosophical argument than an objective one, but I'd probably argue for at least life.  More time after that might not actually be reasonable, I'm not sure.&&Hahahaha, doubt it. The world is much different than it was back then. Corporations own law in the US and Disney is a US company. Other us companies will try to abuse the system up until the final moment the US collapses. US is young as fuck and people think we are immune to collapse. !Remind me 100 years &&Walt Disney lost the rights, when he designed the character with a co-creator. &&Oh god yes I haven't seen that in like a decade.&&[deleted]&&The biggest barrier to creativity right now (as seen in the constant sequel/reboot/gender-swap drek and drivel being produced) is copyright law.

Obviously, this is worth bribing every candidate in both parties in every race for decades to ensure that won't happen.

>Personally life + a certain amount of years seems reasonable.

It's worth noting that the first copyrights issued in America lasted for less than patents do today, and patents are given for new and useful things. A return to 14+7 would hurt no one but major shareholders of media megacorps. The vast majority of profits are made during the year of release, and that's true of music, art, books, and movies. The only exception are long-running TV series that enter a second round of syndication (Seinfeld, basically).&&I agree, the individual (or individuals) that made something should keep the rights as long as they are alive (unless sold).

However I don't agree a company should be able to own the rights as long as the company is running.

If anything the company should have some kind of lease of the character in the employee contract, while the rights still sits with the creator.

Actually I don't like the selling of rights either. (The leasing makes sense though)
That often ends up in some big company buying the rights for something, then just never doing anything with it. While the creator can't give the rights to someone else.&&Didn't Walt invent Mickey himself? &&>  it doesn't seem to make sense to me for a character like Mickey (could be any example) to enter public domain while the company that created it still exists and is using it

It should make perfect sense. The key here is that Disney can still make cartoons with Mickey Mouse, but anybody who wants to can make a cartoon with Mickey Mouse as well, and they can all profit off of them! 

Just think if the estate of the Brother Grimm or Lewis Carrol had been around to sue the shit out of Disney Animation studios in the thirties and forties. We would have never had Snow White, or Alice in Wonderland or so many other classics. They would have been robbed from our cultural history. 

That's what's happening with copyright law today, these extensions are robbing us of our shared cultural history. &&Amusingly, Disney got the rights back in 2006.

Who ran his country on a capitalistic system. He profited from capitalism, which I thought was the entire point of Mr. Jones.

Edit for clarification: Jones like the Czar, profited from the fruits of the subjects labors while he had to do very little in return for them. That is why he was a layabout that didn't care. This was a direct result of a capitalistic system that feeds power to the greedy and strips it away from the people who actually participate in the labor.&&I disagree. The copyright act as it is now means that someone's great grandchildren can profit off of the work that their ancestor did before WW2. 

That's fucking ridiculous. My Grandmother saw Snow White in theaters, my mother saw snow white in theaters, I saw snow white on VHS, and my kids will see it on DVD, and Disney is going to make money on that story that they stole from a fairy tale anyway?  4 generations is a bit much to milk one piece of media.&&And then they made Epic Mickey for the Wii.&&",2018-08-01 16:07:42
New Venom poster released,42385,93lzsm,https://i.redd.it/a91itfxfyed11.jpg,1770,1533099511.0,,"Mama says that Venom is so angry cuz he got all them teeth and no toothbrush&&Netflix subtitles: [sticks his tongue out in Japanese] &&WHEN HE EATS PEOPLE AS VENOM, DOES HE TASTE IT&&Cool poster but I think I will wait for the Topher Grace edit of the movie.&&All the vore fetishists just sexually moaned in unison. &&Hewo, I‚Äôm Eddie Bwock and your boss is a bad man. 


I want to like this movie, I really do, the trailers look amazing, but the cringey dialog and the weird voice are really throwing me off. &&Okay regardless how one feels about this movie, that looks awesome&&His eyes look like Eddie is vaping underneath &&Looks cooler in Japanese&&Yep that does indeed look like Venom &&Venom can tounge punch my fart box any day.&&The art direction of this movie is top-notch. They didn't go the ""our version is new and fresh and dark and gritty so we need to totally change up the classic design of this iconic character to reflect that"" route, as so many superhero films are wont to do these days. They also didn't stray into ""super overcomplicated eye-destroying CGI"" territory, (although they come close at times from what I saw in the trailer). Instead, they stuck with the recognizable parts of the costume and just added their own little creative flourishes and ideas -- for example the way it folds over onto Tom Hardy's head is awesome. Too bad the screenplay and dialogue seem to be total shyte, though that's to be expected considering there are 4 writers and one of them wrote 50 Shades of Grey, another wrote both Kangaroo Jack + Con Air (w/ Nick Cage), another wrote the Dark Tower + the Amazing Spiderman 2, and the other wrote the Aquaman screenplay, which by all evidence seems like another clunker dialogue-wise. &&I want this so bad.&&Well now that they've nailed the look, how is the MCU gonna distinguish its own version down the road? Think it'll be long enough by that time for them to just ape this and nobody will notice because nobody remembers?&&This poster makes me want a Japanese Venom movie where kaiju Venom does battle with kaiju Carnage for the fate of all mankind&&This guy has an absolutely insane underbite. Just look at it, how would he ever close his mouth?

[Quick doodle of the problem](https://i.imgur.com/dxTmqQA.jpg)&&Regardless of the story or acting the visual and audio portrayal of Venom itself is near perfect imo. So many live action adaptations fail to capture a character's essence but this looks like a home run to me.&&The veins are cooler than the spider imo, at least until he sees Spidey. Definitely creepier than a giant spider logo though. &&ah yes. The tongue that spawned a thousand lady boners. Back again I see.&&No wonder I couldn't understand anything he was saying in the trailer. &&Has the rating been confirmed yet?&&I don't know why, but I've always found Japanese writing to be much more appealing on stuff like promo art, key visuals, and posters, even if it's just Katakana.

In other words, I want this. I want it now. I don't care if the movie sucks. This poster is fucking awesome.&&Me when he asks me if I eat ass&&I like how the tongue sticks out from the middle of the bottom jaw instead of throat&&Gotta see this movie about the wet drooling guy &&Ready to munch on some brains&&ok but that one little drip coming down his eye is bugging the fuck outta me.&&It looks so much cooler written in anime &&I really do like the new Venom design, which pisses me even further that Tom Hardy is starring in this (barring his entry into other superhero candidacy for awhile). Because of the way Venom moves physically and how that fits into his action choreography, we don't need someone of Hardy's caliber to properly portray Venom. Hardy could have been Moon Knight or even maybe Sentry who require much more nuanced approach to their character development. Hardy's naturally unhinged/menacing manner could have been a huge plus to these characters. Oh god, he would have been perfect as Moon Knight...&&Yep, that looks like Venom alright.&&Man, this looks great, which is a bummer because it won‚Äôt be in the MCU. &&I just KNOW there‚Äôs going to be ridiculous fan fictions and smut involving Venom.

Still excited for the movie though. &&[Mobile wallpaper](https://imgur.com/a/uOefSar) if anyone is interested&&Imagine accidentally biting your tongue &&Goddamn he looks perfect. &&Is it just me or are Japan's versions of movie posters fucking way more awesome?&&whats it say?&&Trying to understand why Venom looks moist all the time. &&Dont judge by his looks. He is friendly and peaceful. Something stuck in his teeth he is just trying to remove it with his toung.&&The kid in me:Just like the comics in 90s


The adult in me: wish my tongue could do that .. for research purposes...&&I really like almost everything tom hardy is in. I can just watch him sitting in a car by himself. I'll probably see venom. I like him and I like the character,  but I already have a bad feeling about this. maybe it's just a bad trailer.  it's like the dialogue is cut really weird from the get go, like they were trying to hide that these were separate pieces of dialogue, but we can feel all the cuts and it sounds wrong, like some kind Frankenstein sound editing. 

edit; nvm I can't find the trailer I'm talking about. the official trailer is fine. it looks like a good movie. &&Looks like the [old trading cards](http://www.patelisentertainment.ca/gallery/images/venom.jpg)&&I saw the characters in the bottom right first, and wondered why they were throwing random Asian text on a poster for Venom......before realizing that this is the Japanese poster.&&Venom's woman would be a really happy woman. &&anyone else think the poster looks like decade old cg art? like to me it literally looks like 2003 cg.&&Eyes look like cum&&I was just wondering that since the mask is kinda tight around Eddie's face, where does the bottom half of his face go?

I had trouble accepting those trailers as real.&&""The guy you work for is an evil person""

How can you not be excited for this film with this kind of dialogue?&&Never go full retard. Seriously, a journalist  with the vocabulary of a 4 year old?  ‚ÄúI found something bad‚Äù.   Wtf?  That‚Äôs the best a fucking journalist of all thing can do in describing something?  Piss poor.&&We are Bwenom!!&&I keep saying that the best save they could possibly have here is for someone actually talented to rewrite the brief dialogue that Eddie Brock has before the fusion with the symbiote and just add a single line of dialogue from his girlfriend about him sounding weird when he meets her afterwards.

Then, the cringey dialogue and affectation is simply showing a lack of mental capacity as an externalized mental struggle with the symbiote. It would be incredibly lazy, and yet, also a great curveball for haters of the movie. And besides, Venom is supposed to be a bit of a meathead anyway.

In its current state though, ugh... it's painful to listen to.&&The trailer does make me cringe as well. Eddies accent makes him sound hilariously bad, like he‚Äôs playing a stereotype of someone with learning disabilities.

The venom dialogue isn‚Äôt much better. I laughed aloud at ‚Äúlike a turd in the wind‚Äù. Had that hit me in the cinema I‚Äôd have no doubt laughed there too.

Maybe is a low key comedy?&&i literally cannot understand what the symbiote is saying&&Agreed. Venom's eyes seem awkward, too. But as for the voice of Eddie, I think he's going for a Brooklyn boi accent or something, which is fine‚Äîif Eddie were a construction or dock worker, but not an educated, literary profession like a 'weephurteh.' Which ties into the dialogue‚Äîagain, if he were in the manual labor sector, okay...but he's supposed to be a college-educated lexicon adept.

&&The trailers look horrible&&I agree, it also seems weird to me that we have no idea how Spider-Man himself is related to this film. I just hope it isn‚Äôt the same superhero origin story where seen a thousand times already, even if it sucks.&&He sounds like Ronnie from Jersey Shore&&If they aim it at a Chinese market, the movie is gonna be shitty with tons of CGI&&>the trailers look amazing, 

Quite the opposite actually &&Except, as a medical professional, I feel obligated to tell Venom that what he is doing with his jaw could lead to some discomfort in his future.

Now that I think about it the main comics universe does that too. As in ""Carnage USA"" Cletus Cassady (aka Carnage) ate a whole lot of cattle, which gave his symbiote enough mass to overtake an entire town.

Special?""&&My guess is that he just calls himself a reporter and he‚Äôs more of a paranormal blogger.

Everyone thinks he‚Äôs weird. He‚Äôs shunned by society because he‚Äôs different. Except for that one girl who he‚Äôs been friends with since high school and always sees the good in people.

He‚Äôs always been the outcast UNTIL HE GETS POWERS. Now he‚Äôs more confident, more daring. He can take on the bullies. But it‚Äôs also making him question morality and his own goodness. Maybe he‚Äôs turning evil. 

But then that girl, who worries about his changing behaviour, helps him realise that he doesn‚Äôt need the symbiote to be a man. He‚Äôs had it in him the whole time.

So he tries to negotiate with the Symbiote. He fails. To release himself, there must a battle - symbolising the eternal struggle of good and bad within all humans. He finally frees himself from it and all is well... for a moment.

Then the REAL bad guy shows up. It‚Äôs the corporate bad guy, who was fired because of his recklessness now with his own Symbiote! Together they are Carnage! It‚Äôs time for a HOSTILE TAKEOVER. He wants the company  back and revenge on those who kicked him out.  With the company‚Äôs technology , they‚Äôll spread the space virus across the globe. They kill everyone who stands in their way and set the countdown for the virus to be released.

Now Eddie needs the Symbiote one last time to save humanity and save the girl - even if he has to sacrifice himself!!

Together, they fight a gruelling battle across the city. During the battle, the Symbiote is ripped from Eddie. Venom is down and out! Eddie is defenceless. But then he realises he has that final chance - that weakness that was mentioned at the start of the movie. He attacks Carnage and defeats it forever with just enough time to stop the space virus being released! 

Eddie gets the girl! Showing that he had manliness in him - he just needed to believe in himself!!

The corporate bad guy, now in a coma is taken to some metal institute.

""I / found somethin' / rill baaad""

The breaks and weirdness to his voice sound like they were snippets of entirely different lines. This occurs in almost every other trailer so I'm not sure what the big deal is here. It *almost* feels like people are reaching hard for things to not like at this point.&&Sounds like a realistic representation of current day journalism&&We hewa to cwean up dis town.&&I had to watch the trailer because of all the comments and honestly it doesn't really sound that bad. People are making it out like he sounds like Lenny from Flower for Algernon.&&Luckily the dialogue was probably cut from multiple lines and mashed together.

It's because he isn't.&&I'm 99% certain Spiderman isn't even in the movie
&&> it also seems weird to me that we have no idea how Spider-Man himself is related to this film

Because he isn't.

Marvel studios owns the film rights to basically all of their heroes after having either bought them back or the company itself via Disney. Sony has pretty steadfastly refused to sell the Spiderman rights though (since they still make them quite a bit of money).

So for Homecoming it was a joint partnership between Marvel and Sony, with Sony have final creative control (although by all rights they likely agreed to all decisions by Marvel because the possibility of a Spiderman trilogy that's part of the MCU provides them with so much more profit).

Venom isn't part of that deal. Thus it's not part of the MCU, and Marvel are no doubt putting pressure on Sony not to imply the film is part of the MCU. There's actually an interview with Kevin Feige (Marvel Studios head) and an exec from Sony, where the Sony exec implies that Venom might be part of the MCU and Kevin shuts that down super fast.

Ultimately the box office/critical reception will determine if it's part of the MCU. If it does well, Marvel will likely integrate it somehow. If it does poorly they'll just stick to the current story, that the only non Marvel MCU film is Homecoming (and the Homecoming sequels).&&>I just hope it isn‚Äôt the same superhero origin story where seen a thousand times already, even if it sucks. 

Venom isn't a superhero so why are you even worried about this?&&For me it looks like a good trailer from 2002.

Superhero movies evolved so much in the  last 15 years. Comparing this to Infinity War, Dark Knight, Deadpool, Logan... is just sad. Sony is just completely lost.&&Are you trained in Klyntar biology?  &&The thing I hate about Venom (and Karnage, and Rage, and whatever the Venom-Karnage baby is called) is how they sometimes have mouths that clearly have empty space where their hosts' heads should be. Karnage I could understand, but the Venom symbiote does NOT have the ability to rip its host's head in half and perfectly heal it in the moment that it takes to withdraw from their face!&&Take headed of* &&Kamartaj is the solution. &&By that logic I think I saw him dead lift a motorcycle and his form was shitty.
&&I just want you to know that I am currently deployed overseas and my internet is quite terrible sometimes. Not always but today happens to be one of those days. Every click is carefully calculated because I have to wait roughly 2-5 minutes for every page to load.

ASM2 & Con Air were also big box office hits even if the critical reception was poor. I can't speak to the other movies but the writers' track records are fine. 

Venom has an estimated budget of $40-50 million so to be financially successful the writing needs to be 'okay' at best. And with them not being able to connect Spider-Man I think that's all they want. &&*bunnuh&&What did you do exactly &&You just reposted the poster?&&I don‚Äôt think MCU will every be happy with a Symbiotic and Eddie Brock whose relationship isn‚Äôt built on  infatuation/hatred for Spiderman &&If this movie is good, I'm counting it as part of MCU until it's contradicted or until Venom is officially in. If it's bad, then it's its own thing.

I'm hoping Marvel Studios feels the same way.

Edit: No fucking shit it's not part of the MCU. It's called wishful thinking, morons.&&No hate, just curious, what don't you like about the eyes? 

From the head up at least, this seems like a pretty solid Venom portrayal.&&*his entire body has the ability.&&........also its an elastic alien goo that stretches and changes form in every shot in the trailer and in every version of the character. 

The fuck you referring to god damn snakes for lol THERES NO BONES &&I can read it and I still think it looks good.&&oWo&&Most of that texture if the far side of the jaw, not the tongue.  I'd say the poster has a point.  But it's an alien, kinda, so what does it matter, right?&&That's what she said&&Not to mention, if a human could do that, it would be in the same place.&&Haha Hardy is my favorite actor working right now, to the point of manifesting into a man-crush.

I should have clarified instead of rambling on: Hardy's action choreography showcased in Warrior and Mad Max are, in my opinion, top-tier among the actors of his age group. Venom, because of how the character inherently is and how it moves, doesn't require an actor so skilled and physically menacing as Hardy, and he could have found a much suitable role.&&Looks incredible, thanks man! &&Sick.&&b-baka!&&Not even a single letter? &&‚ÄúASS EATING SZN‚Äù&&Lmfao best line in the movie&&REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&&It just hit me that he's the creator of the REEEEEEEE&&RemindMe! 65 days&&I am Eddie Bwock.

Where can I find a bunch of them??&&Delet this nephew&&wha-what are you doing over there onii chan. > w < &&HOW MANY BREADS HAVE YOU EATEN IN YOUR LIFE?&&IIRC Titans just eat stuff for fun, if they get full they just puke everything up like an owl pellet.&&Erin‚Äôs main body is in the back of the titan‚Äôs neck. So none of what the titan eats goes into Erin‚Äôs stomach. In the beginning it‚Äôs explained that titans don‚Äôt have genitalia or assholes and that they don‚Äôt need to eat, they just do. Corpses just stay in the stomach until the titan vomits (to make space for more) or the rest of the body disappears. &&Well, average titans can't really digest humans, so they just puke them out. Don't know about Eren tho.&&Well... When you shift out of Titan form, you abandon the previous titan body. Remember Eren crawling out of its neck? I imagine things eaten stay in the abandoned body &&Titans don't have digestive systems, they just puke the corpses out once they are full. They don't eat for nourishment&&( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&&But enough about Hardy's personal life. Will Venom be eating people in the new film?&&Not really. At most he bites people and then spits whatever he bit off out.

Ultimate Venom eats people though (well, absorbs people).&&That was the one that was cell shaded to look like a comic right? &&im playing it right now, its really fun!&&People have sexual fantasies about everything. Sort of like rule 34 of the internet, if it exists, there's porn of it&&r/unexpectedswanson&&I hate this website.&&What is wrong with you people?&&They wanna eat/get ate. But not the sexual way. Well I guess kind of the sexual way.&&Ohh no he mad XC&&Venom Senpai!&&That's all I can think of when I hear that stupid voice&&I would watch Reptar vs Venom any day.&&Chuckie singing about having a mom in the Rugrats in Paris movie always hits me in the feels:

""I want a mom that will last forever;  
I want a mom to make it all better""

:'(&&All these moments will be lost in time...like turds in the wind.&&To be fair, that's pretty consistent with Venom's character.  He's a total edgelord, but not in the sense that the writers are trying to make him cool and he ends up looking like an edgelord, but that he's supposed to be an unintentionally goofy edgelord in-universe.

That being said, the overall writing doesn't seem strong.  Still, Venom's look is *on point*, and regardless of the quality of the film the part of me that died when Spider-Man 3 Venom debuted is starting to come back after seeing this new version.

&&The delivery of the whole line was terrible, it was like a little kid trying to think on the spot ‚ÄúOmg what more can I say to scare the dude?‚Äù  &&Someone‚Äôs gonna argue with you and say ‚ÄúWELL ITS FROM THE COMICS!‚Äù as if that somehow should make it acceptable.

A fucking Thanoscopter exists in the comics, but we sure as hell are never going to see that.&&Did the boomy-booms blow-up all your wordy word books?&&So that's it, we're just some kinda Symbiote?&&Based on the trailers, Suicide Squad quality too. Upgrade did this much better for like $3.50 or something, this is what Sony got for $50 million?&&Probably more of a factor then any of us care to admit. &&Well, you might use his name. The person to whom you are speaking knows their relationship with him.  Or you might just say ""He's evil,"" and context would fill in the rest.  Audiences don't know the relationship, especially in a trailer, so there is exposition in the line that you would probably skip in real life.

Also, you would probably say what he did. ""He tortured/murdered/experimented on/licked people/children/puppies/apples!"" But again, the line isn't for the person to whom you are speaking. You don't want to give away the plot in a trailer, so the line is there to pique interest without saying too much.

It's very possible that the line only exists in the trailer. And if it is in the movie, it will have context as part of a longer conversation. &&#TOP 10 BAD THINGS I FOUND
#^Number ^8 ^WILL ^SHOCK ^YOU
^page ^1 ^of ^20&&To be even more fair, Eddie Brock wasn't exactly Pulitzer winning.. &&I thought it was set in San Francisco?&&I can't not believe this is this actual script. Thanks for saving me a couple bucks and a few hours of my life. &&I secretly dream of a comic-book movie in the same vein as All the President's Men. Something's happening to a superhero individual.team and they can't resolve it through a battle.

Punching bad guys & laser pewpews are cool, but these movies shine with their character interactions.&&#SAD!!!&&I think this is what everyone is missing. Almost none of the lines so far sound congruent, as if everything has been spliced together to fit the trailer. Does not sound like it's actually a scene running from the film.

Also has no one in here seen a Tom Hardy film? The dude sounds like he always does. I don't get the hate. Looks dope to me.&&Well, I used the characters name but you make a good point. I only recall the characters voice from the cartoons as a kid and the 3rd Spider-Man film. Neither of which were like this but I‚Äôm not sure what his accent is meant to be like.

So whether Hardy doing a terrible accent or a convincing Eddie accent which is terrible I don‚Äôt know.

If Hardy is trying to deliberately sound like that it‚Äôs impressive albeit still silly as hell.

The dialogue I‚Äôm still not sold on.&&Me went to Harvard. &&I‚Äôm aware, my point was that it‚Äôs weird they‚Äôd just make a random spinoff film before establishing Spider-Man‚Äôs role in this new Sony/marvel cinematic universe. I guess I‚Äôm just used to everything being tied into the MCU.&&Wow thanks for the in depth reply! I wasn‚Äôt aware there were limits to which Spider-Man properties were being shared between Sony/marvel. The deal sure is complicated since two giant movie studios intend to share a license without stepping on each others toes. I guess things will shake out depending on the success of sony‚Äôs Spider-Man films.&&Personally, I don't think Marvel Studios will consider retroactively adding it to the MCU, regardless of how well it does.&& I meant ""superhero"" in a more general sense. Its mainly the villain in this movie that has me worried, since I find the generic ""evil scientist/business man"" archetype pretty stale at this point.&&Just so you know ‚ÄúKlyntar‚Äù isnt the species name anymore, their origin got retconed again

Edit: the new origin is [SPOILER](/spoiler ""some dude from the beginning of times made the symbiotes inside a celestial he killed, eventually he lost connection to them and started to merge with other species, the symbiotes then trapped them, the klyntar planet is in reality a giant cage for him and klyntar is their way of saying cage"")&&Yes&&Misspell Carnage one more time...&&This!!

Symbiote goes to Spiderman, Spiderman makes a mistake and accidentally gets someone Eddie love's killed. Spiderman blames the Symbiote and separates in the typical church bell setting and while Eddie is sitting underneath wondering if this was God's punishment for him because of what he's done his other half drops down. They rejoin both directing their hatred at spiderman and boom.

He's talking about a guy with no arms and no legs rolling down the street..&&It'll take a lot to revive that dead part of me. &&I think the delivery is off. In the comics I always imagined Venom saying that kind of stuff with childlike glee. In the film it sounds like he's just trying too hard to be scary. In fact, all of Venom's dialogue in the trailers has this sinister sound to it that doesn't mesh with the goofball from the comics&&Not to mention this human is standing *in front of a 10 foot black goo alien creature with horrifically long teeth* and he‚Äôs not absolutely shitting his fucking pants and going into hysteria.

This guy must have balls the size of wagon wheels if he can look straight at Venom and say, ‚Äúwhat are you?‚Äù

Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?&&Spider-Man, at least at this point, is not scheduled to appear in any of the Spider-Man spinoffs which have been confirmed to be completely unrelated to the MCU's Spider-Man.  My guess is they are trying to introduce Venom as the main  protagonist for these spinoffs.&&Nah just weird having a venom movie without Spider-Man.

Should be home within the week. Thankfully my base has been pretty safe &&Yeah it's the most common way to say ""This is the worst"" or ""You're the worst.""

But outside of actual comic fans, Many MCU really weren‚Äôt hip to Thanos‚Äô character at all. If this is ones first to consuming Thanos media, you‚Äôll go in with an open mind.

With Venom, much of the excitement around the character is based on 90‚Äôs media. I really don‚Äôt think a Spider-Man-less Venom can generate the excitement the character SHOULD have. And taking that angle AFTER a venom solo film could feel sloppy and contrived. Especially, since they‚Äôd most certainly be bringing Venom from R to PG-13 rather than the other way around. 

Hey you could be right. But I‚Äôm not gonna hold my breath.&&I see what your getting at, but they‚Äôve changed the story too much for my liking.

I‚Äôll still probably kinda enjoy the film because venom is my favourite. But the sony stories never fit in with the rest of anything.&&Maybe they will go all Days of Future past and add Venom to Far From Home like Fox did because of Quicksilver being in Ultron&&Tacklin‚Äô fuel&&Lost in a haze of coffee and self-abuse?&&I reeeeeally need Jesus, too. *licks lips*

Some have the trait that lets them transform at will like eren.!<

>!the normal ones are eating every human they see in hope that its one of the transforming titans so that they'll be human again.!<&&My favorite Mikasa quote&&Yeah, based on what he says there, it's clear that most of his threats about eating people were just threats. &&Venom looks like a strong advocate of physical activity, he's very toned. &&What do you mean, you people. &&I'm sure /r/vore would welcome you with open arms...and mouths.&&I had a fucking aneurysm&&I need to know the origin of this pasta.

I also need eye bleach yes, but first that.&&*Releases dove*&&I've seen things you people wouldn't believe&&Yeah, it might have done well alongside Blade or Hellboy. Costume looks cool and I'm still a big Spider-Man fan but there's no way in hell I'm seeing this thing in theaters. Guy's voice annoys me too much and without the Spider-Man context, I don't see how it makes sense.&&Rolling down the street in the wind exactly the way turds don't.&&See, everyone shits on that movie.  And with good reason, for specific flaws.  Mainly the overcrowding of villains.  Had they eliminated Sandman and Franco completely and made it a straight fight between Venom and Parker, it would have been fantastic.  And if they got a more imposing, intimidating actor than Topher Grace to deliver better lines than ""I like being bad, it makes me happy."" I shit you not, he says that.  And the CGI they put over his face looked rubbery, ironically.

I posted this elsewhere the other day and I'm sorry to take another opportunity, but despite all that [I absolutely love how Venom is defeated in Spider-man 3.](https://youtu.be/m8LWjDS3IkQ?t=1m31s)  I love the set up of how Peter sees the bell affect him in the beginning and then builds a cage of tuning forks around him at the end.  God, that is so cool.  I guess people thought it was over-complicated or nerdy.  I bet people like Neil deGrasse Tyson like that payoff, though.  

And I just love when he connects with the pipe after Venom lunges at him.  It's very satisfying.  And when Peter slowly turns to face the disembodied monster is one of those great older school action shots for me.  Like when Hans Gruber starts pulling his gun in slowmo and McClain is holding him by the watch.  But yea, cut out almost literally everything else.

I started the timecode on the clip after Topher's horrible quote I mentioned.  It's better to read it.&&Where does the stuff he's eating go? Into Brock or a little baggie for later, like a colostomy bag but higher up?&&Right? I mean, comparing it to Suicide Squad isn't really fair. The first trailer for Suicide Squad sucked, and the second was better than the actual movie. But everyone involved in Suicide Squad knew it was gonna suck.

You could cut together some shitty lines from any movie, and conclude it wouldn't be any good. &&Pssst, it's the Bugle. &&""Weta Digital?  This is a gift certificate for Whataburger.""    
  
&&I think they went San Francisco to specifically distance themselves from the web-slinger since they couldn't put him in it. 

That being said, this looks interesting enough for me to waste an evening on it at home, but not nearly interesting enough for me to drop $10 at the theater for it. &&Yeah I'm curious if all the ""symbiotes"" are gonna be featured in this movie, or just riot. If this one does well they could make a connected universe starring venom and just have him fight phage, agony, etc.&&I was talking to my buddy abt this last night. Imo it's basically a cash grab using the name Venom to pull interest without it being the real character. It's like a Batman movie where Bruce's parents are fine and hes just rich and learns martial arts after school and decided to fight crime. 

In a way this character is more like Carnage, both in how it's ""random dude with the symbiote with no primary connection to spiderman man"" (which means venom won't be shooting webs or anything which again is a core thing he did too) and the way he uses the symbiote. Iirc there was an axe hand in the trailer at some point? That's not a Venom thing to do, it's a Carnage thing to do. &&If it makes you feel better the retcon is pretty cool, its from the new venom run which i really recommend &&They are some random spawn from an evil god whose name is the Swedish word for fuck. &&No its Qarnayj&&Tell that to Carnji Club&&Or someone who reads Chinese, maybe&&In agony?&&I saw.

Great movie though.&&You might already know that Tom Cruise shot stunts from Mission Impossible here in Norway, at Pulpit Rock (Preikestolen). Climbing up is about a (8 km) 5 mile round trip,  (600 m) 2000 ft hike. They rigged an insane movie screen and speaker system and showed the film here last night for 1500 people. Pretty cool. How many people can say they saw a blockbuster on a cliff in a fjord in Norway? Wish I could say I was there, but the tickets were sold out in a matter of minutes.

And honestly it‚Äôs working&&That movie is 2.5 hours. I can't imagine sitting on those rocks for that long.

It'll be worth it though cause the movie kicks fucking ass. &&It's Pulpit Rock (Prekestolen) in Lysefjorden in Norway. It's in one scene in Mission Impossible, so therefore we have to make a little extra fuzz over it.&&I've always wanted to watch Mad Max in an Australian desert set up like this. I want to smell the sand and feel the heat when I watch it.&&I'm sure they were all looking fjord to the experience.&&I dunno looks more like Kashmir to me... /s&&If this happened in USA at least ten people would have fallen off the cliff after the movie...&&Norway seems like they've got the best nature.&&That would be an awesome experience. 

How was the sound? &&If you can make the hike it sounds like it was an Admission: Possible.&&Norway is fucking awesome. &&Mission Impossible Fjallout&&Was anyone disappointed they said it was another country in the movie?&&Piracy is getting worse &&Something cliffhanger &&I wanted to go, but I couldn't afjord it&&What's funny for me is that I know where this location is from reddit so in the movie when they were at that location from the one they were at before to get to that scene, made me laugh because of the distance haha. Movie magic for ya! &&Slartibartfast must have been thrilled.&&ON A GIANT IPAD&&Probably posted, but this area (Preikestolen) was used in the filming of the movie.&&They can show it on a damn fjord and yet here I am struggling to see the film with my MoviePass. &&My sister was bit by a m√∏√∏se. Mind you, their bites can be pretty nasti.&&Can you imagine hearing the theme song bounce off the hills and mountains, followed by a concert-sized cheer. 
Fuckin‚Äô goosebumps.&&And you thought Red Rocks was impressive&&Holy shit! I would love to have seen that. What a beautiful landscape.&&This is how you advertise in 2018&&I live not far away so i actually watched it with a telescope.&&Is it starring Harrison Fjord?

I'd go see it myself, but I can't afjord it. &&Looks like a pretty UNIQUE experience!  
Seriously though, this looks awesome..&&Takk Tom Cruise, veldig kul! &&I went to a movie premiere and we were like 8 people.&&Y tho?&&Only chance we had to go to the preikenstule on our vacation to norway, We went that day and drove for 2 hours to get there and climb it. Went by car. We waited in line for one and a half hour for a parking spot. Eventually were told the parkinglot was closed because of this movie. Currently back on the boat to Denmark. Fuck my life.. &&Why is mission impossible so aggressively advertised everywhere? And why is Tom Cruise so short?!&&I feel like watching Tom Cruise movies only strengthens Scientology's coffers.&&These are two things that I don't like to mix: indoor life and the outdoors. &&Motherfuck, why is everything so fucking awesome in Norway?&&It's cool and all... But I'll take the recliners at at a movie theater over some cold hard ground &&""Overpaid Stuntmam Has Expensive Marketing People""&&Oh my God, so beautiful.

What the hell am I'm doing with my life to where I'm not experiencing this?&&Might be a great movie but I can't support Tom Cruise and his Scientology nonsense&&did they have enough hours to screen the movie? In nordic countries during the summer the most they get is 4 hours of darkness I believe. Depends on which parts of the country you are but still.&&And Moviepass still didn't work.&&Saw the word Fallout and assumed videogame.  Leaving now because Tom Cruise sucks.&&Hi karen&&Slartibarfast really did some amazing work on those fjords. &&Can anyone shine some light on what the deal is with this movie. Most Mission Impossible movies come and go with little to no headlines.  Why is this one getting so much pub?&&This is hella cool&&That's not a fjord. That's a big ass screen!&&This is interesting but who would enjoy a movie watching from that stupid distance, sitting on uncomfortable rocks?&&A fjord you say? &&I saw the first picture and thought it was just 3 people watching an illegal download on a laptop, then I realized that it was a big screen from a distance&&I used to drive a fjord...&&Slartibartfast would be proud. &&...Why&&Why are people not facing the screen?&&Do you wanna wake up mountain trolls? Because this is how you wake up mountain trolls.&&Why are some people dressed like winter while other dressed as summer? Also, did it get dark for long enough to not have any glare?&&Where do you pee?&&It's terrible. I live not far from there, it's a beautiful place. And thousands upon thousands of tourists going there, littering etc. is not good for anything or anyone.
&&Mission Impossible: Fjallout&&This is really cool, just one of those experiences that can only happen once.

Like how *Interstellar* was shown at the Royal Albert Hall, but the film had the music track removed and a live orchestra played every piece in the movie. &&Do they take moviepass?&&The thumbnail made me think that there was a fjord with a naturally sheer wall that was used as a screen. Disappointed this was just a standard outdoor movie.&&Oh but I can't see it with MoviePass? &&Tom Cruise just shared [this](https://scontent.fath3-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/38405177_10151097218564980_1056556916819361792_o.jpg?_nc_cat=1&oh=59a1ca468fc769a1bdf8fdb13680f074&oe=5BCE4161) insane photo on his facebook account. &&Slatibartfast is definately proud&&I, too, saw this movie yesterday, and it was certainly quite chilly--

--inside the movie theater here in New Jersey. :-/&&Sorry they had to see such a shitty movie. They should have shown a classic movie that was actually good.&&I‚Äôve never heard the word fjord and not thought about the Wayne‚Äôs World scene with Drew Berrymore. &&I've already seen it twice, wondering if I should watch it a third time &&Is that at the Preikestolen? I know a part of the movie was filmed there and visited two weeks ago. Stunning place&&Norway has a very high standard of living.&&No Russian am I right&&lmao people going to fjords now&&Thank you Slarty Bartfast for all the fjords!&&were they all scientologists though? dont support this movie&&Looks like they have afjordable pricing...

I'll see myself out.&&Sic Semper tyrannis!

*Jumps off fjord, plummets to death... &&combo Lincoln/Norway puns incoming&&Fuck you Fjord &&I wonder if Movie Pass is accepted there&&Where  J√∏rn Wilkes-Bj√∏rn shot Andersham Lindvig!?&&Have you ever seen anything so fjull of splendor?&&I think Cruise's career has plateaued.&&I needed that pun like I needed a hole in the back of my head. &&Fjells, too.&&Designing the fjords was always the best part, or so my friend told me. His name? It isn't important.&&Nope we have Starbucks too&&Pretty sure they have Chjevrolet and Hjonda too. Could be wrong though. &&Their coast line mostly consists of Fjords yeah.&&Was it worth it?&&You don't *have* to take a ferry to get there.

[http://norgeskart.no/#!?project=seeiendom&layers=1002,1015&zoom=11&lat=6574368.05&lon=-8176.41&sok=preikestolen](http://norgeskart.no/#!?project=seeiendom&layers=1002,1015&zoom=11&lat=6574368.05&lon=-8176.41&sok=preikestolen)

It depends which direction you're coming from. South? Then there's a small ferry trip.

EDIT: Stop upvoting, and yeah - I remembered wrong! I'm looking at the nearby ferrylaunch, and yep - that's where we took the ferry when I visited Preikestolen. Faen... You can access the whole area by foot, but I suppose we were talking about getting there by car. Which was what I did.&&Oh, man. I would have been so fired with that excuse...&&[deleted]&&All that just to watch a MI movie ..&&It's ok if you like scenic landscapes, cool climate, universal Healthcare and nice people.  Otherwise it's nothing special. &&A very nice place. But expensive as f...jord.&&If you like TV shows about American mobsters you should watch Lilyhammer. It takes place in Norway. &&[deleted]&&Are you /u/Elvellon's colleague? &&Did you have headlamps? I‚Äôve done that hike, and it‚Äôs not easy during the day.&&Well... 1500 can. &&I saw it in paris yesterday, very close to where some of the action take place, it was nice to recognize somewhat the logic of the path he took during one of the chase.

also the theater laughing a Cruise trying to speak french was nice. It wasn't as intense laugths as for Bratoc in captain america winter soldier but everybody had at least a chuckle.&&I knew that cliff was somewhere Europe and it annoyed me the whole time in the film because they said they were in India.&&Kinda funny they located Preikestolen to some place in India..&&When I saw the movie last week I made a mental note to look up the place where the final act was filmed, it was so breathtaking. &&With oil money more than you ever will need, you can do pretty much whatever you want.&&I'm wondering about the equipment. I work in A/V and I do not want to imagine they pushed it 5 miles up a mountain. &&I watched a French movie on a 200 year old church in Brazil with like 50 other people,

Does that count for something? üòÇüòÇ&&RIP MoviePass. You‚Äôll be missed&&I mean you can if you use your on money. &&So I guess you're... pining for the fjords?&&For people with Moviepass who can't see Mission Impossible, I recommend just buying a normal ticket. I can't think if a movie from the last year that's more obviously worth the price of admission.&&Meh. I got my moneys worth in the months it lasted. I gladly paid full price for Fallout so I could get good seats and see it in IMAX.&&If it helps, Norway is one of the most expensive places there is. 

I live in Sweden and while shopping in an art store there came in a whole bunch of Norweigans who came all the way down just because it's way cheaper. And most people consider Sweden expensive. &&Weather is meh, life is expensive as Fuck, alchohol is even more expensive, food is ok at best&&Unfortunately, Norway immigration policies are much stricter, than say, the U.S.'. I hope you have good job skills.&&Reddit has convinced me that nations have no immigration policies and I can just move anywhere I want and take advantage of all their great stuff.


^^except ^^you ^^can't&&It's a pretty long hike up that place, so I can guarantee you they all had something to sit on.&&Rocks are nicer sitting material than people give credit for. Especially the mossy ones. There's also some some grass there, though moss would make way better sitting material. 

Most of them probably brought a sittunderlag anyway. &&Honestly the most Norwegian thing I've ever seen&&Why not? It is kinda cool.&&Woah. Never thought of that, but that would be amazing! &&Upvote for effort.&&There is norway I would miss a chance to do that myself&&Were tickets free or at least very afjordable?&&You should change it to fjordward&&Fjorget it.. making jokes on here is pointless sometimes. &&There was an article in the Danish newspaper Politiken about this, this morning. Apparently, the Norwegian Tourism boards paid quite a lot of money for the 'mountain' scene to be filmed in Norway. Now that the movie is screening, they're a bit miffed that everyone thinks it was shot in India and that they might not get that large increase in tourism they were hoping for.&&If this happened in the US it would be filled with blog boys ruining the experience for the 10% of people who came to actually watch the movie.&&[deleted]&&We do have something similar. [Film on the rocks.](https://www.redrocksonline.com/fotr/)

Every summer they put a movie on at Red Rocks on the weekends.&&Or there would be a shooting... &&We fill a yearly quota of 4 or 5 American tourists falling off there anyway (nah, not really... but it does happen, just not very frequently)&&And all ten people would've sued the movie company...well the ones that survived the fall at least. &&After? You mean during, right? And before, for that matter.&&If this happened in the US, it would be followed by Kevin Costner invoking the Laws of 8.&&Yes, I think so! &&Thank you!&&Dolby Digital Fjord-point-one surround sound.&&We used prototype speakers from Yamaha that worked really well considering it's outdoor. We had a sort of wall on one side which also helped a lot with focusing the sound, especially considering no line array.

Source: I am one of two from our company (UDN) setting this up, and my feet and legs are killing me ator&&Considering it sold out in minutes, for most people it was Admission: Impossible.&&Oh no.&&I felt the same way in Lord Of The Rings. It was clearly New Zealand.&&When I saw the movie, I was wondering the same thing. Also, literally no Indian army was shown. Only a westerner could get this population problem wrong! &&you mean better&&More like a Viking raid.&&Get out.&&Came to make sure this got said.  Have my upvote.&&Came here for the Guide references. Was not disappointed. &&ON AN OPEN FJORD NED&&A m√∏√∏se? &&We apologise again for the fault in the subreddit posts. Those responsible for banning the people who have just been banned have been banned. &&wat&&kult*&&So would these people, but as a one-off this is very neat&&Don‚Äôt worry! There‚Äôs probably a movie theatre nearby you can see the movie at!&&I agree, it disgusts me that he is still an actor. He's done and said so many horrible things but he keeps getting roles.&&Summer is ending here, so the sunset is closer to 10 pm now in this part of Norway. Northern Norway has 2 full months of midnight sun, whereas southern Norway will have about 18 hours of light in June. &&I'm positive it's because this movie's star beings to a pretty infamous organization, and that organization has been getting a lot of bad press lately.&&It gets windy and cold after sunset here. Sunset was around 10 pm yesterday. &&That‚Äôs the one! &&Yes, it was sponsored by Fjord Motors.&&Unfjordunately it says it's all sold out though.&&Why would you see yourself out? Did you write that with the intention of ruining the comment? 0&&Bet Lincoln avoids that theater too&&Wow, the seal of Virginia is badass&&Robin is not a Norway fan now?&&Hey, that's uncalled for.&&Yeah, but you still aren't getting Mission Impossible... &&And trolls, but they're mostly contained by the high voltage electric poles. &&And on them you find fjols.&&Yeah I've heard the fjords along the coast of Norway won some kind of award. Or so I've been told.&&Hhgttg. Love that description. &&Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its destruction.""&&Which we got surprisingly late. Our first Starbucks came here just six years ago. I was at Oslo City (which opened the country's first Starbucks, if I remember correctly, right after the one at the airport) and the line for it was huge. You would've thought there was a celebrity appearance there.&&I spent a week in Norway staying in  Geiranger, Voss, flam, Oslo, Bergen and a few other towns. It was amazing. I envy you haha &&And the most expensive burger king in the world.&&Bravo.&&Take my upvote clever one.&&Have no idea. Have to ask her tomorrow. &&The hardest choices require the strongest wills&&Honestly, can't imagine it was. &&What did it cost?&&No lol, hours of waiting, cold places, and the setup had to be pretty bad so a movie experience ranging from bad to terrible.&&You can also Halo jump&&Well, Stavanger (and southward), where most people in the area live, is a ferry ride. I should know, I live here!

Edit: I agree that you don't *have* to!&&And how would you get there from the North without a ferry?  &&You really need a Tom Cruise clause in your contract&&We have pretty good job security in Norway. Can't just fire people over nothing here. &&Ditto.  I could never afjord to lose my job over a movie.&&We are in Norway, you can't get fired over small things like that... &&In America we can't be bothered to walk from the end of the parking lot.  ""The close spots are full, Looks like we're going home kids""&&Ah, I guess I'll skip it then.&&I was hoping for cool people, scenic healthcare, nice climate and universal landscapes.

So close, and yet...&&Don't forget it makes Sweden look cheap
&&If you like good food you're kinda fucked though. The only spice Norwegians understand how to use is sugar.&&Don't fjorget black metal. &&I'll stick to my freedom and continue to ignore all of my health problems like a true American.&&Don't forget, lots and lots of state oil money to pay for it all, with only 6m people to share it with.&&High ass taxes too&&Took my honeymoon there. We already knew how expensive it was, but it was just so incredible how expensive things were there. Luckily we set our wedding gifts up as a website that took donations instead of gifts we didn't need. That made it a lot easier to ignore the sticker shock on everything. It's a wonderful country and i would love to visit it again. &&Spiritual spin-off to The Sopranos (albeit at a much, much lower quality)&&It doesn't get dark before around 23:00 there now.  &&Maybe&&Is that the girl who skipped work? Doesn‚Äôt sound like it&&Yeah, practically everyone had headlamps so it looked spectacular.&&And for others it was ‚ÄòAdmission Impossible‚Äô&&/r/theydidthemath&&I saw a picture of it that‚Äôs like being there. 1501&&Impossible&&Hey at least in the movie he's not a French guy, but an American who speaks several languages, his dialect made sense.&&Wait, were French people laughing at GSP‚Äôs Quebecois French? &&> to recognize somewhat the logic of the path he took during one of the chase.

What logic ? See that map https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjkqX-4XoAECr7d.jpg:large&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Lol. You caused so much confusion and dissension below. &&He always has to speak a different language at some point in these films and I just assume he nails it every time. Was wondering how well he actually does. &&That was part of what made Captain America: Winter Soldier special for me, it was shot in cleveland so I was able to recognize almost every shot as a street I'd driven down, etc. &&In India, the movie got censored in way that there is no mention of India.&&I didn't know and thought it was Kashmir because it did look very much like it.&&Norway spent a couple of million helping them out with the location. We‚Äôre fucking weird.&&""I'm not dead yet!""

-MoviePass&&AMC will be the new one for me.  Smart money says expect ""Disney Pass"" and ""Universal Pass"" soon (because why would they get creative with the names?)&&I quit MP 2 months ago as I just wasnt using it enough (have 2 little kids, and a pretty busy career atm).  It was clunky to start, and I understood that given how big it took off.  Then I got that email 2 days ago.  Wow, what a dumpster fire.  Basically: No big new titles, showtimes and movies may vary day-to-day so you can't plan on things, and admittedly poor customer support.  Oh, and I heard prices going up.  Part of me wonders if this was the plan from the get go.  Get a shit ton of subscribers, and change the rules less than a year later hoping most are just too lazy to cancel.  &&I‚Äôve had movie pass since like November and when it first started it was fantastic. Now they change the TOS every other week and soon there will be a price increase on top of the surcharges. Ultimately, it was too good to be true. Unsubscribe. &&word. was fun while it lasted. atleast it worked all summer for me. &&He's not pining, he's passed on!&&Yeah. If only I could a fjord it. &&Yeah seriously, people are already complaining lol like just do what we all did a year ago and pay for the fuckin thing.&&Do you think seeing the previous mission impossible movies is necessary?&&Bladerunner 2049 would like a word.... (also a lot of other good ones) &&You have the goods that's cheap for us Norwegians. Tobacco/snus, soda, alcohol. &&Interesting, Sweden is considered expensive where I come from - but only because we are used to everything being cheaper outside our little ""island"", the prices are about the same as at home.&&Sweden is cheap as hell.
Source: Am Norwegian &&[deleted]&&Rocks?&&Jepp &&It is, don't get me wrong, but us Norwegians tend to make a fuzz whenever we are mentioned in foreign media :-)&&ikr? Hopefully this will inspire them to do it for a special screening.&&J for effjort&&Tickets were $12 including parking.&&They even paid foreign reporters' travel expenses to come see the movie at Pulpit Rock.&&Storywise it makes sense that the movie claims it to be in Kashmir as Ethan's ex wife needed to be there to help run a medical camp for the poor. Norway doesn't need such camp and her being in Norway then wouldn't make much sense 

Edit - spelling&&I was just at Preikestolen a couple weeks ago and I can tell you it doesn‚Äôt need any more tourism. That place was packed! I‚Äôm honestly surprised people don‚Äôt fall off of that thing every day. &&In glad. Imo it should have been shot in the real life Kashmir in india and pakistan.&&I was trying to figure out where the mountain scenes would have been filmed, was thinking Alps at first, but seemed a bit more rugged than that. But then I saw Pulpit Rock and was like oh yeah,  Norway...&&They didn't mention the word Kashmir in Indian release so there's that.

https://scroll.in/reel/888534/mission-impossible-fallout-removed-mentions-of-kashmir-before-india-release

Also, I have read that it mentions Nubra valley in the valley. I haven't watched the movie yet but I can assure you that place is mesmerizing. I was there last year and it just stubs you so much that you lose your concentration while driving almost going off-road.&&Good. We get more than enough tourists already.&&is... Blog Boys a thing? &&So sick of them blog boys&&Agreed. Fences ruin the experience and don't eliminate stupid people.&&Not even Dolby Atmos Fjord-pont-one?! Pfft, miss me with that antiquated fjord shit.&&In a few weeks time the picture will be reposted with this as the tagline. &&[deleted]&&I feel like some sort of ama, maybe in a sound engineering subreddit might be welcome! &&Very, very interested in pictures of the sound system.&&And if anyone snuck in, they might have fallen off the cliff.

A relatively tiny amount of our oil money is used&&We dont spend too much of the oil money these days though.

&&Why is he driving so much if he has teleportation? HRMMM&&Kinda, he does this thing in like A LOT of his movies where he insists on his character speaking another language.  He definitely does it with other languages like Russian in at least a few MIs and I think he speaks Egyptian in The Mummy for some reason&&Yes. The accent/sound wasn't too bad by itself. But it came off weird in context, like his character seemed too confident in the language, and he also used some unusual phrases iirc.&&It was pretty shocking how bad it was, especially considering the few lines he had of it.&&It's pretty ridiculous that most people watching in India would not even have known it was India. The entire last act left us confused with all the dialogue butchering.&&But the central plot involves Punjab&&Why?&&[deleted]&&Can confirm I once broke a bottle of beer at a gas station there and they were way too nice about it &&Well, it will be soon. They're very ill.&&Yes you are! You‚Äôll be stone cold dead in a moment. &&As long as I'm still able to see a movie once a month I am saving money on Movie Pass ($10 sub. price vs $15 movie ticket price).  Once that is gone then I am out. &&I honestly wish I could quit but when I signed up you had to pay for the whole year in advance.  I don't mind paying for the whole year, but I think it's total BS that I wasn't grandfathered in with the way the system worked at the time I signed up.  When I signed up, I could see any movie I wanted any number of times for free as long as it was once per day.  Now I can't see the same movie twice, I can't go on some opening weekends, I have to take a picture of my ticket stubs, and now I have to pay out of pocket during ""premium"" hours.  

I see every movie that hits theaters just out of spite because I want them to lose money at this point.

**Edit:**  BTW, I saw MI:6 last night and it was a great movie.  Action packed, funny, good story, lots of twists, and kept me on edge all night.&&My local theater has a $5 Tuesday deal for any movie, you don't even have to be a member of anything. I think I'll stick to that. &&I just don't understand how it can work, because it's a third party buying the ticket for you and not the cinema taking a hit, they're hoping enough users will subscribe and not use it thus giving the budget for all those tickets. But it's so desired that a lot of subscribers are using it plenty.

I pay ¬£22 a month for Odeon Limitless which has been around for a while and the reason that it works is because Odeon (a UK cinema company) are the ones providing it and they can happily choose to lose the profits they would have got for the ticket because there's a good chance I'm buying snacks.&&It's still a great deal even with the price increase and surcharges.  

Unless you're not a huge movie fan.&&Moviepass works perfect for me. I go once or twice a week, have zero desire to see the same movie twice(which apparently is a big deal for some people), and go early during the week, never to big opening weekend shows.


So all the TOS changes have not affected me at all. Even with a price increase, it's still well worth it. &&Not in the slightest. &&Watch the 5th one, Rogue Nation. Fallout is pretty much a direct sequel to it. You could watch it without, but you wouldn't know the significance of certain characters. You could skip the rest, but definitely watch 3 and 4 later because they're really good.&&Bacon!&&It's really, really hard to immigrate to Scandinavian countries.&&If you're Norwegian, and you're a hiker (or not, most people have them) there's a 100% chance you have something called [""Sitteunderlag""](https://dbstatic.no/67043004.jpg?imageId=67043004&width=1024&height=615) in your backpack. &&A well worked out butt&&upfjord for effjord.&&Which is what Norwegians earn in sixty-three seconds. &&Storywise, it needed to be in Kashmir because, the galciers overs there feed rivers that go into India, Pakistan, Bangladesh

That is the entire point of it being Kashmir. The resulting fallout would be catastrophic to 1/7 of the world's population.&&The problem (and the reason why it wasn‚Äôt actually filmed in India) was apparently that filming in India caused to much trouble to be worth it.

&&The main thing I‚Äôve heard about this movie is the diversity. Very little about the actual film which just seems like a regular rom com &&As a Moderately Poor Asian, I don't feel like going to see ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a good way to spend my money financially&&As an Asian dude (Filipino), I'd say that I want this to at least do moderately well, but I doubt the quality of the movie will entice me to watch it. Representation in Hollywood I feel is becoming a more appealing aspect in film, but when an entire film is aggressively revolving around the fact, I feel as if it'd turn the general audience off.

But, it being a rom-com I'm assuming that it is attempting to appeal to the young female audience, so it may do well as the book was also successful.&&I‚Äôll give this movie a chance. Since we are talking about Asian American cinema, check out ‚ÄúBetter Luck Tomorrow‚Äù on HBO. It was the directorial debut of Justin Lin, who went on to direct a few of the Fast and Furious movies.&&As an Asian living in Asia, I‚Äôve seen so many Asian dramas with the same plot and probably done better. It‚Äôs really sad how American Asians are so stripped of the oppurtunity to star in movies that they have to resort to a 2 hour long generic Korean drama to be considered revolutionary. &&Dang, reddit really wants this movie to fail by the sounds of it.&&To be fair, there is a severe lack of proper representation on Asian americans in the media&&Not sure why the comments in here are so negative. It's been getting decent reviews and my friends who have seen it in advance have said it's good. Maybe the title isn't great but it's the name of the book it's based on. 

I, for one, am excited to see this. &&ITT: People not understanding the movie is an adaptation of a book by the same name. &&The negativity is this thread is ASTOUNDING. 

So, I'll start by saying that I actually read the book. 

It's not a rom-com. There are definitely elements of comedy but it's much more of a romantic drama with a decent bit of mystery. 


The book wasn't the best literature in the world but it was FUN. I read it so quickly because I was just enjoying myself. 

Not to mention, while things are over exaggerated because of the focus on the tiptop of the upperclass, I learned a decent bit about cultures I don't know hardly anything about.

I think that's the biggest point of the way this movie was handled. 

The main thing for me is I will go out of my way to support something for the sake of diversity. 

I'm not Asian. I'm biracial (black and white). But I want everyone to be able to see themselves represented in television and film. 

Back in the winter, I went to see Disney's new ""A Wrinkle In Time."" I don't particularly like Disney. I don't have a reason to go see a kid's movie. The reviews were awful. 

But when I saw the trailer and I saw a little mixed girl *playing* a mixed girl, I bawled. That's something I have so rarely gotten to see in my life. So I went and saw the movie. & It meant the world to me.


All of that just to say a few things, really: you guys have NOT seen the whole movie in just the trailer. You've assumed the genre so you assume you know the plot. If we want diversity in media, we have to support the things that we're given. Shit, go see a Sunday matinee of it. Think about Black Panther as an example. If people can prove they want to see something, they can move one step closer to those things being normalized.&&25 years? Mortal Kombat came out that long ago?&&What was 25 years ago?&&> (Before going with Color Force, Kwan fielded pitches that included turning his heroine into a white woman; ""It's a pity you don't have a white character,"" he was told by one producer.) 

What the fuck?&&before wonder woman came out out I saw a good take: ""so men are allowed to be in mediocre superhero movies but when we finally get the first woman superhero film, there's intense pressure that it 'needs to be good'"".  

This movie, despite its quality, is a huge stepping stone for asian representation.  you ever notice people are way more critical of minorities or women when mediocre straight white men are allowed to be successful? when white people talk about representation, they want ""the best"" minority / women to play the part but are totally ok with a mediocre white man taking a role.  &&I'm interested in the movie as I enjoyed the book, but I'm more likely to have watched it on Netflix.  Ironically, I probably won't see this until it's available for streaming.

As others have pointed out, the cinema is dying and people mostly go for the spectacle of big budget films.  I understand their idealism but it seems misplaced in this day and age.  Should have done themselves and everyone else a solid and gone with the big payday.  &&IMO more people would see it on Netflix than in theaters...?&&I'll wait for the remake with Scarlett Johansson and Matt Damon&&Out of all Asian-American films it's really disappointing that this is the one that is going to be represented. 

I wished ""Gook"" had been picked up by a bigger distributor. It was one of the best movies I saw all year and is a much more meaningful representation of filmmaking and Asian-Americans, specifcally Koreans in LA around the 90s. 

But if an all Asian-American studio film wants to be taken seriously in such a tough market, it needs to have that ""Moonlight"" effect.&&A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas was released in 2011.&&I think the maker highly underestimates the types of movies that are actually seen in theaters these days. Unless it's worth $20 to see in IMAX then it's definitely going to be pirated or watched when it eventually comes to one of the streaming platforms. &&Harold and Kumar weren‚Äôt Asian Americans??&&Surf Ninjas is 25 years old are they talking about Surf Ninjas&&In 25 years? ""Saving Face"" came out in 2005, and was distributed by Sony Pictures and produced by Destination Films which is a division of Sony Pictures. It didn't have a huge theatrical run but it did fairly well.&&It's not the first Asian-American focused studio movie in 25 years though.

&&Why is ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" not considered? &&Well that was really stupid of them.

How about get the gigantic pay day and FUND THAT FIRST ASIAN-AMERICAN-FOCUSED studio for years to come.

Or you can fund the distribution costs and once it tanks Netflix will then offer you a fraction of the original deal. &&It's nice to have ideals, but passing up complete artistic freedom and a guaranteed trilogy for a dying method of distribution seems like an awful decision.  More people would see this if it went on Netflix.  Theatrical releases aren't the draw they were 10 years ago.&&I don't know if I'm their target demographics, but saw the trailer and wanted to see it in the theater. I don't even like romantic comedies, but I just like that it's something different and new.&&An article well worth the read. I‚Äôm happy for the cast members and any project I‚Äôve seen with this much love and passion has been worth seeing.&&This is so dumb.  WB didn't counter because they KNOW Netflix is the best course of action.  The film crews get to make 2 more so 2 more chances to make a hit, AND if one of them is successful, they get to come back to WB demanding EVEN MORE.

This is why modern progressives fail... they don't think long term like the previous generations of gays/minority who carefully navigated into positions of power and planted seeds for a life time.  This generation is way too knee-jerk.

&&100% will not go see in theatres, would of if it was on Netflix. I guess once it's out of the theatres it will possibly get into Netflix but I think they missed the boat. This movie isnt going to be some huge game changer like they seem to believe it will be.&&I'm not sure that was a wise move. More people would probably see it if it were a Netflix Original. &&Bet some of y'all who were doubting the movie are sitting with your face stunned at the 100% RT score so far. 

Also, if you aren't Asian, don't speak for Asians who are happy to see themselves getting representation on the big screen. This is more than just ""ah, we can have crappy rom coms too."" It's more like, if a film led by an all-Asian cast can do well in the box office, so many more Asian led films can be greenlit and we would in turn get even more representation in Hollywood.&&The weird thing is though the main male lead actor is half Asian. And he's supposed to be from Singapore and has fully Singaporean ancestry in the book. It'd be like if black panther were cast to be half white.  

I'll still see it. The last western medium size movie with an attractive (half or not)Asian Male lead was from 2010 (Warrior's way) and Harold and Kumar was from 2004. It'd be too much for me to wait another 8 years for positive representation. I guess Keanu Reeves counts but most people can't actually tell Keanu is part Asian.  

And I don't think it's because it's difficult to find attractive male leads. There are plenty like Daniel Wu that would've done the role just fine.  &&Harold and Kumar was filmed in 2004.&&As an Asian (Filipino), I am not interested in this film at all. It looks like they are trying way too hard to send a message of, *‚ÄùHey, look at us! We can have movies too! Look how successful, and funny, and charming, and good looking us Asians can be!‚Äù* The film looks like your typical, generic rom com that is geared to not actually tell a great Asian-centric story (like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), but to ‚Äúprove‚Äù Asians are awesome and worth watching like white people!! 

Ugh...

&&Isn't that true progress? When any demographic can have movies that represent them and its seen as a regular movie instead of a progressive ""event"" film? &&If Tyler Perry can do it, so can you!&&I have a dream that children will one day live in a nation where they will not judge a movie based on the race of its protagonist but by how clich√©d it is.&&No joke, I'm happy Riz Ahmed is in Venom because representation is people of every color being cast as generic villains in bland superhero movies&&Got em!&&Speaking of Asian American movies, Better Luck Tomorrow is fucking amazing.&&Queers got it with Love Simon now Asians get itnwith this!&&I'll watch it not because I want to, but because I feel like I have to to support my Asian brethren.

The most ideal scenario would be it being a terrible movie, critically panned... but make a SHITLOAD of money at the box office.

Then people will open their eyes and realize, wow, there sure are a lot of Asian we can pander to, and eventually get better movies that don't marginalize Asians.&&That's how I feel about ""Dr. Ken"".&&Chris Rock had a joke about how many people think Jackie Robinson ended racism in baseball. Problem is, Jackie was a great ball player, other blacks player up till the 70s had to be really good. it wasn't until the 70's when mediocre black guys were able to play, that's when racism in baseball ended, when black guys could be mediocre just like the white guys.&&Is this really what you wanted? Okay, fine.

(But seriously I'm rooting for that John Cho movie to be really good. Super skilled/likable actor, he deserves a leading role, it's about time he got it)&&I really enjoyed the books though. Sure they weren‚Äôt serious literature but they were funny and well written. &&I'm sure this will hit Netflix eventually.&&I think alot of people here are underestimating the popularity of the book.&&It's better to say you had a movie in theaters that no one watched then to say you had a straight-to-netflix movie no one watched. It's not much but anyone can make a bad movie for netflix, not everyone can get that movie released in theaters.&&It‚Äôs not really a movie that would warrant venturing out to the theatres. &&Pretty much.. This movie looks like hot garbage.. The kind of thing i watch on Netflix on a Sunday afternoon when i'm incredibly stoned.. Sure as hell not paying to see it in a theatre. &&Kal Penn isn't the right type of Asian apparently. &&You know, I never thought about this until now, but do you know why Harold and Kumar is great as an Asian-focused film? They are Asian actors that could easily have been played by people of any race. Their characters were not defined by their race.&&I think their distinction is the entire ensemble is Asian American, whereas that was just the two main characters but a lot of the other actors were different races.  &&Ever heard of a cock meat sandwich?&&No no no, everyone knows the last box office movie with asian leads was Big Trouble in Little China.&&It's based off a best selling book. I guess I'm glad it isnt about Kung Fu though. 

I like Constance Wu. I might see it idk.&&It's good that we will have a choice in terms of which Asian-american lead film we want to see next month. John Cho's Searching is coming out as well, so it's great that we have a rom com and a thriller, each targeting different demographic and hopefully be succesful in their given genre.&&Plus the trailer looks *horrible*&&The book was great, at least.&&As another Asian moviegoer, I am excited and ready to give my money to this movie so more can come out of this. Reviews have been good, the cast is pretty solid, and the book was a fun read. I am a sucker for rom-com so it helps the decision. ;P&&Not Asian, but I thought the same. Like, would I go see a movie called ""Crazy Rich White People""? No way, I'd just rewatch Arrested Development.&&I don't mind the title. I was expecting something a little bit more ""zanier"" like what the title suggested, instead the movie looks pretty damn tame and generic in comparison. &&It‚Äôs based on a book with that title though. &&I mean. That‚Äôs the title of the book it‚Äôs based off of...&&I agree.... who the fuck are crazy rich asians,  I'm broke ass Asian why would I want to see that&&Idk I was interested in it & so was my friend, who doesn‚Äôt like movies with POC. (Says she can‚Äôt relate or whatever ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

It‚Äôs a basic romance that shows that it‚Äôs OK to have Asians in all of those basic all white movies too‚Äîwell. Only if this does well. &&Eh. 15 minutes might be a bit excessive, but if you have other options to spend your money, knowing whether you‚Äôre going to get a deal done affects your other options. I don‚Äôt think expecting people to commit relatively quickly is all that unreasonable as a general rule. 


I‚Äôm not sure if the need is there in this particular case, but holding up business to wait on people to make decisions can cost a good deal of money.&&I read all three; the first because my book club wanted to, and the other two because I was enjoying them so much.  It's escapist fiction, about the lives of stratospherically wealthy people in China/HK and Singapore and the crazy level on which they compete with each other for status.  Also, food, lots of interesting food.   &&This is the exact same sentiment I had the first time I saw a trailer for this. I immediately had a flashback to being at a restaurant right next to an independent theater. They were having an event of sorts for the opening of Sex and the City. There was a line out the door of almost exclusively women who had all gotten dressed up to the nines to see it together. I fully expect the same scenario here. It‚Äôll have a reasonable opening weekend due to that demo (maybe a few more boyfriends dragged along), and then it will die down very quickly over the coming weeks, probably more so than Sex and the City because at the time that already had quite a bit more mainstream appeal. &&I was eating microwaved lasagne when I saw GI Joe retaliation. That's about all I remember from it. &&I gotta say... I saw Step Up 3, and while I wouldn't call it good cinema, it was a really fun theatrical experience. CRA is very visual, the story is very lush and focused on pretty and overwhelming looks, so it could make a good theatre experience. &&You know, I WANTED to see this and now you ruined it.&&Step up 3 was solidly entertaining though&&Oh shit this guy directed step up 2 the streets?

That is legit one of my fave movies, and I consider myself a bit of a movie guy.

Look I know it's not a great movie and I'm not saying they should have won awards... But I really like how the story unfolds and the callbacks to step up. 

You've actually just convinced me I have to see this. &&Step Up 2: The Streets 4 life, son!&&Holy shit Jem AND GI Joe? &&It basically is a romantic comedy. But Asians should also have the opportunity to have a catastrophically boring/run the mill rom com.&&It's based on the popular novel&&[deleted]&&If you've ever seen any Asian drama, K-drama, J-drama, C-drama, etc., this looks like a Hollywood budget film version of one of those&&Welcome to 2018.&&I have absolutely no problem with a movie having a predominantly Asian cast, it‚Äôs great for a lot of reasons. But can we really call it diversity?&&How is it diverse if the main characters are all Asian? Diverse isn‚Äôt the right word &&Well, it's not diverse. It's all Asian. Diversity isn't ""no white people"".&&Moderately poor Asian would be pirating like a stereotypical poor computer-savvy Asian.  Why pay when you can get it for free?  ü§£&&I feel like it plays into stereotype that people spread when they see the rich spoiled East Asian kids attending American universities with daddy‚Äôs money. As an asian american myself, I‚Äôd prefer to see a film about asian americans like myself rather than super rich people who live in another country. Just my 2 cents&&An Asian just happy seeing Asian characters in movies like Randall Park in Ant Man or Ned in Spider-Man. I remember Dante Basco in Hook playing something that was not stereotypically Asian.&&I agree, a movie that centers this much around diversity could completely flop story-wise. However, my hopes are much higher considering that they didn‚Äôt write the story thinking, ‚ÄúOh we need to cast as many Asians as we possibly can.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think the author wrote this thinking that he was going to write a story about Asians because they‚Äôre under-appreciated in the literary world.&&I could see it being a big success in the asian community similar to how Tyler Perry movies are always successful in the black community. Those movies make a lot of money. &&is it really being aggressive when the story is set in asia? or are you talking about the marketing &&It has Han‚Äôs actor from F&F in it, also playing a character named Han, so we have to assume this is in the F&F universe.&&Yes.  Anyone who hasn't seen Better Luck Tomorrow should see it immediately.&&I'll need to spin up Better Luck Tomorrow again. I saw as an Asian-American high school senior attending attending a competitive, upper-middle-class, predominantly Asian-American high school like the one depicted in the movie. I was really excited about it, seeing something that mirrored my experience, and then... was just not impressed. At the ending I was just kind of like wtf did I just watch. Might be I was too young to appreciate it.

In the years since I've developed the feeling that Justin Lin's better suited to popcorn flicks (really enjoyed his F&F entries, even Tokyo Drift, and I liked his Star Trek). Perhaps I'll give it another chance.&&What you say is true. It reflects how the Asian-American experience is much different than the Asian experience, and as such, Asians aren't really qualified to speak about Asian Americans. You seem to get this, since you recognize that this movie would only seem revolutionary to Asian Americans. 

This is an important point to make, since there are many instances in which white people try to silence the complaints of Asian Americans by saying, ""Asians actually from Asia don't care, so you Asian Americans are making a big deal about nothing. Snowflakes."" The reason Asians in Asia don't care about many racist things in the US is because its not something they've personally experienced. They did not have to go through grade school having their peers mock them viciously for their food/clothes/accents, only later for white people to say ""why isn't sushi your favorite food?! You're Japanese!"" It's not my favorite food asshole, because my entire 4th grade class called me a barbarian monkey when I ate it. And now its cool?! Go fuck yourself.

End rant. &&I think some of the comments are less about the film and more about the article tied to the film. &&I was pretty excited for it, then I saw the directors previous projects. 

I hope it turns out good, but I don't have a lot of faith in the guy who made GI Joe 2 and Jem and the Holograms &&It was a great movie. So much negativity in a thread mostly from people who havent even seen the movie yet.&&The comments are negative because this is Reddit and anything that screams ""minority representation is good"" is downvoted to hell.  &&Literally no one in this thread has read the book üòû &&Agreed: and seeing the ‚ÄúAsian here, I have no interest in this movie.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre not indebted to support it, but it‚Äôs really short-sighted to voice this opinion needlessly. It reinforces to others, ‚ÄúEven other Asians have no interest in this movie.‚Äù to other ethnicities. ‚ÄúLook they don‚Äôt even care about representation!‚Äù

If this doesn‚Äôt get good numbers, it won‚Äôt be seen that Rom-Com‚Äôs aren‚Äôt bankable, but Asians aren‚Äôt bankable. Let‚Äôs not invest in any other Asian stories. If this is successful, we‚Äôd have a better chance of seeing More Asians in normalized roles. Not just martial artists, geeks, magical Asians, dragon ladies, background color. 

These declarations to dismiss also sniffs of a little internalization.&&Fatality! But to answer the question MK was 23 years ago. I dont care what anybody says, I loved the first one. &&I'm guessing the Joy Luck Club. And a quick wiki search and yup released in 1993.&&The Joy Luck Club.  Which was a really good movie btw.&&That's a great point. I avoid the theater unless it is a movie that earns something by being that big with surround sound. A rom-com is a waste to see in theaters. &&I think it‚Äôs about the perceived esteem of a theatrical release compared to Netflix, not so much the number of actual viewers.&&Maybe, but it would not have the social effect it could potentially have if it is succesful. If it was on Netflix, maybe it will be advertised for a month to just be forgotten. If it is successful in Hollywood, you are looking at more money towards those actors, producers and the director for future projects. Although, this could all be a PR move to hide the fact they fucked up by not accepting the Netflix offer...&&Clearly there not Asian though. Didn't you get the memo ^/s&&Harold and Kumar was not a studio movie -- i.e. made by one of the ""majors"": Disney, WB, Universal, Sony, Fox, Paramount.&&It opened in less than 400 theaters, wasn't a 'studio' movie, and had a $250k budget.

I'm not saying I agree or disagree, but those are likely the reasons it was not included.&&Because Better Luck Tomorrow was an indie film distributed by an indie distribuitor thus had a very limited release even for an indie film.  This will be distributed by WB and distributed to regular theatres. &&I highly doubt the amount of money was enough to fund a full studio movie. It was, at most, a few million dollars for each person involved. 

But also Netflix promised a full greenlit trilogy. I think that would have been better for Asian representation overall than having a movie come out in theaters that will likely not do well in the US. &&This is my biggest beef with the movie. I read the first book and it was terrible but I loved it anyway and am definitely going to see this adaption but really?? You‚Äôre making a big deal about East Asian representation in a big budget romcom yet casting a half white actor?? Especially since the novel made a big deal about the family‚Äôs prestigious heritage. As if 100% Asians are not hot or masculine enough for western audiences or something. My other issue is that not everyone in Singapore is of Chinese descent and judging from the trailers those who aren‚Äôt wont be represented.&&This was my thought as well.  There are so many other guys they could have cast.  And why give him a British accent?? Vanness Wu would have been the shit.&&I‚Äôm Taiwanese. The director gives me no hopes either. The man made GI Joe: Retaliation, Jem and the Holograms, Now You See Me 2, and...a bunch of Step Up movies???&&Reminds me of those rom coms with an all black cast. I guess the point is to not tell a great Asian-centric or Black-centric story, but to just tell a generic story that happens to star a cast of diverse individuals. I mean 95% of movies with a mostly white cast don't tell any white-centric stories, they just tell a story. To have a story be (race)-centric just makes it more stereotypical, and I guess the point is to make minority casts be on the same level with everyone else. But could they have no chosen a better more engaging story instead of...this?&&I remember seeing the trailer in theaters and thinking ""Oh how nice, a movie with an Asian cast without it being specifically about them being Asian"" and then the title pops up ***CRAZY RICH ASIANS*** and I go ""Oh...."".&&[deleted]&&Hey man this our Wakanda&&""regular"" movie with ""asian"" in the title&&The website [See AsAm Star](https://www.seeasamstar.com/) has videos and gifs of just that - Asian American stars ‚Äúdeepfaked‚Äù into hit movies as the leading roles.

When we're allowed to have fucking *terrible* films centered around lesbians they don't revolve around the fact that they are lesbians, I'll be happy. Maybe every film we put out doesn't have to be ""brave and cathartic,"" maybe it can be ""subpar and something to do while folding laundry."" &&OH LERD&&Stealing jobs from dudes with British accents.&&I agree with you, also seeing him in Star Wars was huge for me,  someone from a South Asian descent being represented like that on the big screen. &&He's also in a short tv series about a guy who may or may not have killed a girl.

It's about time to razzle dazzle Hollywood with immaculate Korean boyband hair.&&All hell broke loose after Fish Man got with a Ciswoman.&&It‚Äôs a Warner movie which means its premium window will be on HBO; they have an output deal with their sister company. After that, films generally go to basic cable (FX often winning those bids) although Netflix could potentially outbid. Then the film enters the ‚Äúlibrary window‚Äù at which point everyone including Netflix/etc bids. Your estimation feels likely; if Netflix liked it for first run, they probably still like it downstream (at a lower price).&&This would have been perfect for binging on Netflix because an hour after watching a Chinese movie you're just going to want to watch another movie again anyways&&Massively, imo. Not sure if it‚Äôs going to be popular in mainland China, but if the movie vibes with them, then this movie is going to cash in HARD.&&The first thing I thought when I heard the title is ""omg they made it into a movie!""

&&Most western audience goers only go to big action comic book movies these days. Per capita theater attendance in the USA is at the lowest in 24 years. People just don't go to the theater like they used to. It's an outdated experience. Majority of people prefer watching movies at home. The theater experience is just not relevant to most Americans.

I think that is really what actors of color want. They want regular roles, rather than playing stereotypes.&&Yes and no. That's the beauty of why it was such a great Asian American orientated film. There were moments where they faced a lot of things that Asian Americans faced (Kumar's dad wanting him to go to medical school, Harold's boring job that's seen as a success by his Asian American peers, wanting to date outside their race, etc.) but at the same thing it was a stoner flick that could ideally be played by anything.&&A major theme of the first H&K is that ""positive"" stereotypes about asians being smart and hard working are still stereotypes and they can be hurtful.  That kind of required asian actors.&&That's not true, the underline context of the film had a lot of racial stereotypes including asians, blacks, indians, whites etc. They poke fun of these multiple times in multiple installments, not sure if they just flew over your head...&&Better Luck Tomorrow then?&&if you like her, you need to go watch. if this movie bombs at the box office, it will be another 25 years before hollywood tries an all asian casted movie again. we‚Äôll get more scarlett johanson playing a japanese person. &&I just found out that she's from RVA and what little I've seen of Fresh Off The Boat, she's great in, so I'm sold on her. &&[deleted]&&Is searching getting positive buzz?

Great trailer, thanks guys!&&I liked the trailer.. Then again, I am a sap for romcoms, and may or may not have a crush on the protagonist..&&> horrible

Really? Why does it look horrible? &&I think people need to contextualize the movie a bit. It wasn't a particularly well-written book, nor was it anything special.

But it was a great, enjoyable read, with interesting characters, and a fun plot. Was it academic or cerebral? Of course not. But it is exactly what the movie will be: a fun, easy, and perfect for summer. &&I think it's getting a lot of criticism here because rom-coms aren't exactly the types of movies r/movies has any respect for. It's clearly not aimed at this demographic. I have a few lady coworkers who fit a marketable demographic (not all asian, just, you know, girly-girls) and are pretty excited about this film and will see it in theaters. 

It's just not a film geared towards most redditors.&&That and I want to support fellow asians. This will help asian entertainers get more opportunities.

Like if a female-led action movie does bad, that must mean all female action movies are bad, so why waste money making them. But we can have dozens/hundreds of bad male-led action movies.

Seems like is the same logic. Any minority-led movie has lots of pressure to do well in order for more minority-led movies to come out. If one fails, they all fail.

Edit because I forgot to add my actual point: Basically we need to be ""allowed"" to have bad minority-led movies.

Once we get there then we‚Äôre good.&&Basically.

Like there is nothing wrong with stories that show the tragedy and struggles of people of color and queer folk but here's the issue. 

Almost every single movie that features unrepresented people are tragedies and struggle movies. And that gets somewhat boring. Also, it's just depressing. I don't want to see black people constantly being degraded, called slurs and being treated like garbage. Same with movies that feature LGBT+ people. Give us more gay comedies, more black fantasies, etc. 

They don't always have to be perfect, they at least have to be enjoyable on some level. And like lantern said, this sub does drool over mediocre white guy movies so why can't we do the same?&&Tangential, but this was one of the things I loved about Deadpool 2.

Negasonic is gay, has an adorable gay girlfriend... and no one makes a big deal about it.  They don't have to struggle to be accepted or anything like that.

The jokes made are about how different the two of them are (i.e. Yukio is uncontrollably cheerful and adores DP and his antics, while Negasonic is perpetually angry and can't fukkin stand DP), but their sexuality is never treated as a punchline, or an achievement, or anything of note.  

""Yeah, she's gay ... so what?"" kinda feels like progress.&&Trying to understand zombie sexuality and gender identity...&&[deleted]&&Also the name of the book the movie is based on. I think it gets a pass.&&* ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""

All ""regular"" movies that have something to do with a typical race or stereotypes.  ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is just the first majority asian cast movie with a decent budget, that doesn't have some crazy historical context or martial arts/kung-fu to garner a reason for being mainly asian in cast.

But the fact that I had to think about it for a second to come up with a name off the top of my head seems to back up the idea of their point, even if it is incredibly exaggerated.

First thing that popped into my head was [Better Luck Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Luck_Tomorrow), a good flick, but that was a while ago too.&&Let Thanos direct. Perfectly balanced (and it‚Äôd be the first big-screen movie directed by a purple person).&&I dunno, I thought the mediocrity actually resulted in it being pretty powerful.

You can definitely feel that it was made for appeal to a lot of people, and certain things about it are very average, but overall I was really surprised how good the movie was.&&I think it is interesting that they may remake Big Trouble in Little China with the Rock as Jack Burton. When they made it in the 1980's, test audiences thought Wang was the hero of the movie. They made John Carpenter do re-shoots because they studio thought the default hero had to be the white guy. So we have gone from the hero has to be the white guy to the hero can be the racially ambiguous guy. &&Bob‚Äôs burgers is truly ahead of it‚Äôs time. Thanks Tina. &&Title: Reborn This Way&&Yup. It's exactly the same as every other zombie film except the zombies are gay.

There's zero change to the plot, infection vector or character arcs so essentially like Dumbledore. &&I think the problem people are looking at these days with female led movies is that male directors and writers fall into the trap of making their female leads ‚Äúbadass strong women‚Äù with no flaws or humanity behind them that people want to see.   This is why people like Charlize Theron have gotten praise for characters like Furiosa, Tully, and even her character from Young Adult.  People want to see women on screen, but more than that they want a character that they can relate to for reasons other than just being a woman.&&[deleted]&&What's even more annoying is when an all female remake of a classic movie (Ghostbusters, Ocean's 11, etc) doesn't do well and Hollywood says ""See??? People don't want to watch movies with female leads!""

No, I just want to watch original concepts instead of a lazy goddamn remake. &&[Reminds me of this xkcd comic.](https://xkcd.com/385/)&&Yeah, there is a lot of extra pressure on a movie that has minority or female leads.  If a Superman movie is a flop no one would say that people weren't interested in white male leads, but had Wonder Woman flopped it probably would have used as ""proof"" that female superhero movies were non-viable. Similar to how people would say that since Eletrka and Catwoman flopped that the market wasn't as big for female superheroes; despite those movies being terrible.&&That was like a moment in real life when some girl comes out and everyone's like ""yeah, no shit.""&&Hi Wade!&&Train to buttsan. &&And Psylocke is technically a British white woman possessing an Asian woman's body.&&""Tortilla Soup""&&When you read the book, it's really clear that one of the main aims of the author is to introduce Western audiences to an existing facet of Asian society that they may be unfamiliar with.  That is why the main character is a middle-class American (Asian-American, but very much culturally American) who is also unfamiliar with the culture of ""crazy rich Asian"" families. 

So the aim is not to increase Asian representation by just including Asian faces, it's to increase representation of real contemporary Asian culture and recent history.

Video proper starts at 00:25.&&Unfortunately not that I know of. I just know this stuff because i work in the entertainment industry so I follow it. Here's a quick overview off the top of my head:

There are 6 major movie studios + a few mini-majors. Here is where they distribute their content for the so-called premium window:

- Warner Bros --> HBO (both are owned by Warner Media / AT&T)
- Universal Pictures --> HBO (just a licensing deal; probably a 3-5 year deal that's been renewed at least once; HBO pays a lot for this, probably $150mm+ per year)
- Disney (owned by Disney) --> Netflix (deal ends this year; Disney will be taking this in-house to their new streaming service next year; I think this deal is like $150mm per year or so)
- Paramount, MGM, Lionsgate --> EPIX (they each owned a piece of EPIX; these deals have already expired or will be expiring soon; MGM bought out Paramount and Lionsgate and now owns EPIX outright)
- Lionsgate --> Starz(?) (I assume this will happen; Lionsgate bought Starz recently so it makes sense they will move their content from EPIX to Starz , if they haven't already)
- Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox --> not 100% sure on these, I THINK they either do one-off auctions for each title, or maybe they sell small bundles of films every so often; to me knowledge they don't have long-term deals with premium services, although someone please chime in if i am wrong

You also asked WHEN movies tend to go to streaming services... this is always in flux. The trend over the last 5-10 years is that the time between theater and premium service is shrinking, somewhat (largely?) due to piracy concerns cannabilizing downstream revenues. Nowadays, I think we see movies enter the premium service window ~3-6 months after they LEAVE theaters. Again someone chime in if that's wrong. &&It's not really a ""stereotype,"" or at least not an untrue one.

While MSG is found in nature (and American restaurants use it on occasion), it's certainly more heavily used in Chinese cuisine. The umami flavor of MSG triggers an insulin release, which makes you feel more hungry. Additionally, it ""tricks"" your brain into thinking you're eating more protein than you are. About an hour after you eat, your stomach realizes you actually ate less protein than you thought, which triggers somewhat of a hunger response.

Cliffs: MSG actually does make you hungry after you eat, and pretty much all American Chinese food has MSG.&&i don't get it&&It says a lot about the era when Chinese food was something new and strange in America. In the 50s and 60s, adults had all experienced the depression, so the worst thing a restaurant could be is insuffiently nourishing. They had experienced hunger, and they didn't want it again.

Of course it's not accurate, but rice is fairly light (while still being super calorie dense) and the meat tends to be cut into small pieces, so people can fool themselves into believing it.&&Yeah, me too. I've always felt very full after getting Chinese takeout. I always got 2-3 meals out of one takeout lunch special and it was fantastic when I was a poor single guy trying to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible.&&""People get hungry again shortly after eating Chinese food"" isn't an obscure stereotype or statement.&&Not worth the surge pricing that seems to be on any showing after 11am either &&They ran out of money&&An argument can be made that Russians are technically Asians, too. 

I like to think of Asians the way I think of elves. There's quite a variety, but they're all elves. &&Okay, they referenced the whole concept of someone being ""not that kind of asian"" due to the fact that US culture assumes ""asian"" refers to only east asian physical appearance, while neglecting the appearance of people who live on the indian subcontinent. 

But that takes longer to say and the reference in the movie was still a joke. &&Americans call Indians Indians, not asian&&So you call Pakistani people Indian? &&I've only heard brown in NYC. In California I hear South Asian or just Indian.&&The Jews? **Asian**&&Europe is part of Asia &&I mean part of the main reason they ended up in Guantanamo was because they all assumed the indian guy was muslim, and therefor a terrorist.

Then, instead of being able to explain their way out of it they get thrown into Guantanamo for being foreign terrorists.&&He can solve every crime except the one that drove him into his alcoholic depression: the gruesome murder of his best friend Kumar by an unknown serial killer. He's vowed never to eat another hamburger until he catches the man responsible.&&Saw an early screening of it a couple weeks ago. It's great. For anyone worrying about it being gimmicky, you stop even really noticing the computer screen thing after the first 10 mins. There's only a couple points in the film where it seems a little silly. But overall a really well constructed mystery, I'd highly recommend it.&&It's somewhat the norm, but this trailer not only revealed & resolved the whole ""Will they/won't they?"" plot, it also revealed & resolved the reasoning behind the plot and how it's solved by the girl standing up to the bitchy mom.

I mean other than watching for some of the jokes, there's no reason to see the whole movie if you've seen the trailer. There's no question about anything that happens, most romcoms advertise on ""how they got there"", but this movie's trailer even shows the whole thing in chronological order. It's nuts.&&I mean 99% of movies are the same basic plot. Every Marvel movie is a big bad guy is going to destroy the world then the hero stops them. Most movies aren‚Äôt about the idea, they‚Äôre about the execution.&&As someone who read the books you don‚Äôt have it the way you think you do. You managed to rehash the trailer scenes but widely missed the remainder of the plot. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs an amazing story but you can‚Äôt really say the trailer gave the whole thing away until you‚Äôve seen the movie/ read the book. &&So it‚Äôs *Coming to America* but with Asians and no Darth Vader?&&YEEZYUPLOADS-WEBRIP-720p-ENGHARDCODE-MP4AAC&&Wedding Crashers. 

Watch that movie and notice how Owen Wilson stalks Rachel McAdams and then objects at her wedding after having a magical 2 days of romance with her. And he‚Äôs under false pretenses and crashes weddings and funerals to have sex with women. And she goes for it. 

Bradley Cooper is a douche in the movie too, but they never show him cheating on McAdams or beating her. He‚Äôs just a jerk. 

It‚Äôs a funny movie but watching it with a critical lens made Owen a real weirdo. &&I‚Äôm a struggling artist so all I have is this $12,000/mo open concept Soho loft. &&I was about to say, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt that just be Asian Arrested Development?‚Äù and then I saw the username. &&I enjoyed Black Panther (thought it was visually stunning, the colors were amazing), but yeah you're point is spot on!  It's easy to take representation for granted when it's always been there.  For minorities, their race or gender or sexuality defines how much of the world sees them and therefore how they interact with the world.  Even if it's the same genre like superhero or romcom, the stories are different just because of the centering of those characters.  It's nice to have your story told for once.&&Yep. Not a lot of room for social change concerning Asians (East Asians in particular because Americans tend to assume Asian = Chinese/Japanese/Korean) when the only media representation is either Kung Fu or socially awkward emasculated side characters who usually play a comedic role. Like seriously, when's the last time an East Asian has been cast in a Hollywood blockbuster. It's unheard of in today's media.

I'm up for anything that pushes towards breaking stereotypes for any race. Like you said, I didn't think that Black Panther was a super amazing movie ""movie-wise"", but being a Marvel movie, a ton of people saw it, making it an iconic movie ""representation-wise"".&&>People often underestimate how empowering and significant it can be to feel represented in something mainstream, even if it's not groundbreaking. It's tough to understand if you've always been represented.

Just to make the connection for people who may not make it, this concept is one of the main points people make when they say ""white privilege"". It's not necessarily meant to call you a bad person, but it's acknowledgement of the fact that things as simple as having a movie about people that look like you and have the same culture as you is taken for granted.&&Theres a certain sense of empowerment when historically disenfranchised groups are accepted into the mainstream of pop culture in a non-stereotypical way. &&Imagine Me & You was the first one I saw!  The main characters are played by Piper Perabo and Lena Heady (Cersei from GoT).

It was one of the most exciting stretches of nba in the last few years. Linsanity was just that. Fucking insane. &&Totally. One of the things *Love, Simon* really helped me to understand and something that other more ""profound"" gay movies had never quite communicated as effectively was how much harder it is for a gay person to navigate young romance in a predominately heterosexual world. Not having anything to do with tragedy or persecution, but just statistically how much harder it is to be attracted to people and then trying to figure out if they're even gay or not, especially during a time in life when maybe they themselves are still trying to figure that out.&&I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but that‚Äôs what I always basically tell people that think or say ‚Äúwell, no shit!‚Äù When someone comes out. 

It‚Äôs not for you.
It‚Äôs for them. And even though it‚Äôs fine doesn‚Äôt take away the difficulty of doing it. &&It's on my movies to see list and I'll probably knock it out sooner-than-later, but especially for this:

>He understood that coming out wasn't really a ""big deal"" anymore, and his parents would love him either way, but it was still so difficult for him to do.

I've thought about that. I'm straight, but if I were gay, I feel like I'd still struggle with coming out even though we live in a much more accepting time than ever before. My friends wouldn't care, and neither would most of my family, but there's just something about declaring oneself ""different"" that seems unnecessarily hard to do.&&I was so focused on that 1% of rejection when I came to my mom. Like she had made it clear that it'd be okay well in advance and still i struggled to do it. I wasn't even the first of her children to come out. &&Same here. One of my favorites of 2018&&Such a good movie, saw it at a friends house and it caught me by surprise&&Were the zombies gay? I thought the zombies all were in love with Tina and they had a 11 zombie+ her relationship or whatever number the basketball team had.&&This is why I think female ensemble cast shows like Orange is the New Black or GLOW are so important and interesting - they're women's stories, fully told, flaws and all. Not all of the characters are good people, some of them are even bad people, and they don't shy away from exploring that. It's really refreshing to me to be able to see women on TV who are characters in their own right, instead of either being the ""badass lady hero fantasy"" or ""she's a person but really she's a girlfriend"" or ""mother"" tropes that you see so often. &&I partially disagree. It's no so much that they are flawless bad-asses, it's just general bad writing.

Look at Tom Raider. That's a very talented actress wasted in a weak-ass story with very weak development.

Had they written her with some flaws and such it wouldn't have saved either her character or the movie from a weak script.

And the same can be said with many, many other high-budget action movies not matter the gender of the lead.

We are just plagued with weak scripts being green-light for blockbuster movies. But it won't stop producers to blame it on female leads not working out and such non-sense. If they made a bad Jason Bourne clone staring a gay Asian male lead, guess what they would say is at fault? Certainly not a the producer's  actual poor choices.&&I feel like its the same way with black Americans on television.  The 90s had Fresh Prince of Bellaire and Family Matters which were family sitcoms centered around black families.  They weren't ""black shows"" and they aren't typically remembered as such.  They were just very popular, mainstream, sitcoms, that happened to feature primarily black characters.  &&Honestly, I'd attribute that to the rise of the PG-13 rating.  Female action leads have to somehow ""play nice"" while still being ""tough"" to avoid that R rating and be family friendly.  Can you imagine Katniss saying the line ""get away from her , you bitch!"" or stabbing a guy with his own pen like Sarah Conner?&&Ripley and Sarah Connor were amazing characters in amazing movies, but not the only great character. Aliens had the Xenomorphs, Bishop, and so on. The Terminator had Reese, and The Terminator himself. They're great characters in a world filled with very powerful characters. Inversely, so many modern movies cast women as the only/main hero, and one of their virtues is the fact they are women... I think that takes away from writing good characters, because they are trying to prove something as a cookie-cutter badass female, rather than being a badass female in a world of badasses like Connor and Ripley. Furiosa is that way, too. She's a powerful woman in a world filled with powerful, vile men and women. &&I actually thought Ocean's 8 was pretty okay. Not amazing, but a fun time. Not 100% original, but I wanted a heist movie that wasn't a 1-to-1 rehash, and it fit the bill.&&Nobody went to see Annihilation&&Ocean's 8 didn't pander in nearly the same way as Ghostbusters 2016.

Ocean‚Äôs 8 was pretty decent&&If one ever wonders if there is a relevant xkcd, the answer is always yes. &&I think those two flops are WHY it took so long for a female-led superhero movie to come out. It is a shame. We are missing a lot of great ideas and movies because people are scared to fail. Because if they fail, others won't get a chance.&&First one to the end of the train gets touched by their good looking Hyung and carried off into the sunset in search of the last bottle of lube.

&&28 Cocks Later&&To further prove the point of the lack of Asian representation in film; Tortilla Soup was an American remake of the Taiwanese film Eat Drink Man Woman directed by Ang Lee.

&&Totally agree.  At the same time that plot line can also be substituted with another culture (Jewish, European, African, etc.) when scripted for the big screen.  I'm happy that the book was made into a motion picture as is, and also with a decent sized budget to boot.  The main point now is it's a predominately Asian cast in a generic, wide release rom-com!

So now I‚Äôm all for it.&&I pretty much never see anyone of my ethnic background in films period except as an extreme stereotype, such that the one time I saw someone of my background play a normal character (with only one line!) that wasn't a bastardized cartoon I got so excited and legitimately teared up. It makes such a difference to have representation. &&You hit it right on the nose. Media shapes how most of America who doesn't hang out with a lot of Asians views us, and in turn how you get treated in day to day life. &&Little white kids are begging their parents to get them T'Challa and Shuri costumes for Halloween. That's freaking awesome&&Woah now.  Imagine Me & You can't be lumped in with average romantic comedies.  It's so good. &&Well I'm white and growing up it was a case of all the guys saying they didnt have a problem with girls of other ethnicities but they wer only attracted to white girls. That's not me saying they were racist more so that at least the people in my life seldom looked outside the bubble of what they felt was comfortable. 

I've expressed that I think Asian women can be just as attractive as other demographics and the people I know thought it was a fetish. I think that gives perspective on some of the stuff I'm talking about.&&Everyone was happy during Linsanity, except for Melo&&Glee hit on those points well in it's first year or 2, actually. &&*Love, Simon* was honestly the most relatable gay film for me. A lot of stuff that happened in that movie reflected experiences that I had as a teenager to the point that it was actually kind of uncomfortable at times watching high school me making the same mistakes I did.&&Correct response is ‚Äúthank you for telling me. I‚Äôm happy you can share this with me‚Äù&&You should check it out, coming out is a major theme of the movie that's touched on a lot, so it's very enlightening and puts words to the specific concept you're describing.&&I second what others are saying. At its core it is a fairly straightforward (no pun intended) teen Rom com, but the specific drama that Simon deals with is really well drawn and I found myself really empathising with how hard it can to be different even in an accepting environment.

Very much worth the watch.&&It's definitely hard, when I came out the only person that wasn't able to accept it was me.&&*Six Feet Under* did a really good job of telling the stories of all of its characters' flaws and struggles, but I especially appreciated its portrayal of the female and gay characters. 

Ruth, the mother, who devoted her whole life to being a caretaker, wife, and mother due to the era she grew up in, and her arc is all about learning to be her own person. Claire's my favorite because I identify with her a *lot* as the girl who never really fit in and was kinda shitty to her family until she was forced to grow up and realize how good she had it, and her whole arc is about growing up and finding happiness and fulfillment, even if it means risking everything. David and Keith are a couple, and they're the most realistic gay couple I have ever seen on TV. This is no small feat considering the show began in 2001. They're not caricatures of a gay couple like the guys in Modern Family, and their relationship is just as complicated as the straight relationships in the show. 

It's my favorite TV series, and this is part of why.&&Most of Netflix's originals have absolutely stellar character development for female characters&&I think both your point and the parent point are valid. Although I agree that in order for a character to shine the writing has to come first. Additionally no amount of good writing can save a perfect protagonist.  Look at all the best superman stories they all focus on his flaws or weaknesses or at the very least incorporate them heavily in the story. &&That was only because of the Cosby Show by the way.

Bill Cosby made a **very big deal** about that show having nothing to do with them being black, just portraying a normal, healthy family who happens to be black. He was a famous and successful stand up comedian, who holds a PhD (in real life) and a big time black advocate. Because the show was legitimately funny and wholesome it became the #1 show, which was the first time a black sitcom held that title, or a show with a black lead, etc etc. It used that status to fight racist ideology without actually directly addressing it, simply by being a normal, successful family who happens to be black.

This was why his rape allegations were so difficult for older people to come to terms with. He was arguably the best role model for black people since MLK, with a lot more mainstream appeal. It's also why Dave Chappelle did the superhero bit, because Cosby really was a superhero to black people in the 1980s. And its because of him that Family Matters and Fresh Prince were even possible.&&[deleted]&&I'll agree with you about family matters. The hook was that urkcle was weird not that he was black.

 Fresh prince... Ehh I'll kinda disagree with you. The hook of the show was that a cool black guy from Philly essentially joined a rich family. Yes it was an all black cast buuuut, a lot of jokes basically boiled down to will Smith is a cool black guy and everyone else is lame but they app love each other in the end.

Also if you want to talk progressive the Jefferson's had an interracial marriage back in the 70's&&I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre black or not, but I am a black woman. And as such, I can tell you that a lot black people when asked about black shows they remember growing up, Fresh Prince and Family Matters are named with a whole host of others. A black show is just that, where a majority of the characters are black and it centers around those black characters and black culture (even if it‚Äôs subtle, in the way the characters talk, dress, interact with each other). 

In fresh prince, Cosby, and family matters‚Äôs case, these were black shows that also happened to appeal to a larger non black audience. There is nothing wrong with that. In many of the episodes in those shows they addressed blackness and racism, particularly in Fresh Prince. 

Now as a young black person who grew up in the 90s and watched tons of black shows including the ones that weren‚Äôt so popular, each and everyone of those shows is valuable. Each show, even the worst (homeboys in outer space) showed different levels of what it is like to be black in America, whether they were wealthy, middle or working class (Roc) or dirt poor, each show was a different insight into the fact that blacks are not one homogeneous group. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say well these shows aren‚Äôt black because well they were popular with whites too. They are certainly just as black as Martin or Good Times. It further proves to me why representation is definitely needed.&&After seeing Ocean's 8, I described it as the ""okayest"" movie, I had ever seen.  Didn't love it, didn't dislike it.  It had some fun parts but nothing especially memorable. &&Would you recommend this as a rental then?&&[deleted]&&Donnie Darko and Fight Club flopped at the cinema too. &&The promotion for that movie was terrible. Most people I talk to outside of Reddit don't know what it is.&&Lady Bird made $78 million on a $10 million budget.&&I think this was marketed horrendously tbh. I follow films pretty closely and knew almost nothing about it. I doubt most of my friends have ever even heard of it. &&I've heard they're both decent movies, but that's exactly my point. I don't want to watch them because they're remakes, not because they're bad. (FWIW I feel the same way about any other remake - Jurassic Park, etc. I just want original concepts dammit.)&&>Representation is about these things being done without it being the point of the movie.

Exactly. This is the one thing I really liked about Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (the plot itself is only so-so imo) - there's an Asian male love interest, which you NEVER see, and the show never even mentions his race as far as I can recall. He's just portrayed as a normal dude, no stereotypes. I knew so many people like his character in CA but you never see it represented in movies. &&One of my favorite films (Eat, Drink...)! I got hungry just thinking about the opening scene... &&You're mistaken. He's talking about the documentary about a lovable cartoon elephant setting sail, *Babarship*. &&Harold and kumar is the best asian american stoner comedy. Also has John cho in it.

So basically, just have John cho in your movie and you'll do great!&&And Han, before he became all fast and furious. &&I think Joy Luck Club had a pretty big marketing push in Asian audiences and also had a book behind it. 

Better Luck Tomorrow was definitely smaller and an original story.&&Sorry missed the bottom half of your comment.

I'm a strategy executive at a large TV network group (definitely nothing to brag about given how our world has been rocked by Netflix/etc). I also grew up in Texas, coincidentally.

Candidly I tend to have a negative POV on film school if you want to be in production (e.g. writer/director/etc). If you want to work in creative development and aren't at an ivy league school, I'd suggest seriously considering transferring to USC (I know that's drastic and potentially expensive but it's my honest POV and I don't say it lightly). I know a bunch of USC film undergrad folks who ended up in really good development jobs; USC's network and administration just seem to have their act way better together than UCLA does, and NYU/Columbia are 3000 miles a way which is a huge hurdle. DM me if you want to hear more.&&Thanks for the correction. Fox --> HBO makes sense, i see the the new X-Men stuff on there (e.g. Logan). Interesting that Sony splits their titles between Starz and Netflix; makes sense given Netflix's targeting of kids for several years now.&&It‚Äôs usually a massive amount of carbs which fills you up quickly and then you‚Äôre hungry again. &&Which makes sense when you consider the US has mostly east Asians and UK has mostly south Asians&&Except they refer to the others as ""Chinese"", whether you're Malay, Japanese, Korean... they're all referred to as Chinese, whereas Indian is Asian

Source: Spent a year at LSE in 2011&&I mean, it's not like the Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese have had good relationships with each other. And Europeans have started the most horrific conflicts in human history in order to kill each other. &&Imagine how the Irish feel about being considered the same as the English.&&I mean, who do we have good relations with? Our maids are being murdered and shoved in freezers &&That's a matter of ignorance, not category. I make a best guess based off of appearance and if someone says they're Pakistani I'll call them Pakistani.&&[removed]&&Don‚Äôt forget Mexico!&&Reddit is the only place I see this complaint about trailers. &&That's the kind of self-awareness that can change the world&&That is a level of self-reflection to which I aspire.  Kudos, seriously.&&>I realized I was only annoyed because I was losing my own representation.

This pretty much sums up all of the stupid Black Panther hate. White people were upset that a movie with mostly black people would get such acclamation.&&Haha, it's definitely one of my favorites, I just figured straight people might consider it an average rom com.  I love the DEBS movie so I don't consider myself a very objective person when it comes to rating straight vs. gay movies üòÇ&&Yep. There‚Äôs a lot to be made fun of with Glee, but it‚Äôll always hold a special place in my heart for that very reason. I was 14 and had just come out to myself when it premiered in 2009. 

There had been gay teens on tv before, but Glee was one of the first shows to portray gay dating in high school as 1) Not just a tragedy about coming out, and 2) Not just a carbon copy of dating in high school as a straight person. 

It was like a revelation at the time. Even if I didn‚Äôt relate to the character himself, I definitely related to the experience of watching everybody else in high school pair off in couples and realizing you don‚Äôt even have any potential options. It was an incredibly reassuring experience for me.&&First time someone told me I was baffled because we weren't that close so I just thought ""why did he tell me?"" &&There were other ""black"" sitcoms in the 80/90s: 227 and Amen on Saturday night.  That was such a weird block, after those two it was Golden Girls and Empty Nest, both of which were about senior citizens.  Honestly it seems like a lot of what the kids these days would call diversity/inclusiveness has been retroactively wiped from the past.&&I find it important to point out that Bill Cosby doesn't have an actual [PhD](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/24/bill-cosbys-doctoral-thesis-was-about-using-fat-albert-as-a-teaching-tool/?utm_term=.284284d1f101), insofar as he didn't take traditional courses to get it and basically just wrote a term paper about how his acting in Fat Albert/Sesame Street/Electric Company was impactful. 

Every other thing you said, I completely agree with. As shitty of a person as Cosby is, I can't throw away the influence he had on my life, and the life of my father (who grew up without a Dad).&&The 90s as a whole had that vibe. Living Single, Martin, Eddie Murphy's Boomerang. Even *Different World* which was in its essence a 'black show's, it still wasn't 'black focused'.

This is what bothers me about Black-Ish. I like the show now but still haven't seen the first two seasons because although I fit the demographic, ""black experience"" shows are very US focused.&&> But at the same time they must over celebrate and emphasize how much of a tragedy, struggle whatever it must be to be a non-white male. 

***Exactly*** what urks me a bit about Black-Ish. I love the show a lot, don't get me wrong, but it's often like ""Dre! You have a seat at that table. You RUN that seat basically - please stop using every opportunity to explain why you're in fact lesser than everyone there"".

I know I'm nutshelling it a lot and that's far from the whole show, but those moments magnify because that's when I'm cringing.&&A big part of why The Fast and the Furious was such a big deal&&I think it has to do with the fact that they're so few and far between. If you only have 1 movie with a female lead and she's aggressive or ""bitchy"" then it comes across as Hollywood always portraying women as bitchy instead of just that one movie being like that. &&I would say that the depiction of the family in Fresh Prince worked really well, because it focused on a family that even rich white people thought was upper class, but happened to be black. This mixed well with Will Smith's character who was the ""cool black guy"" that we often thought of at the time, but he was dealing with very normal problems every day. The jokes, like you said, mostly came from the cultural differences between Will and his family, but I think that did a lot to help show that there was not one single ""black culture"" and that culture varied person-to-person in every race, and that individual people don't represent their entire race.&&To be fair, it was the 80s and 90s when *hip hop culture* was near exclusively black. He wasn't a cool ""black guy"", he was a cool ""hip hop, urban"" guy who joined a rich family.

You could basically remake that story with, like Pouya or something and have it fit for today.&&Not OP but I would.  It's not going to blow your mind or anything, but it's a solid, fun movie.  I liked it more than I like Ocean's 12 and 13&&yeah, for a couple of bucks it was a fun ride.

That being said, if you waited for netfilx or Amazon Prime, that'd be okay too.&&I honestly hadn't even heard about it until people started saying it was a failure. &&I literally didn't know it existed while it was in theaters. People bitch about advertising all the time, but honestly it can break an otherwise great movie.&&I liked it too, but I went in knowing that it was New Weird SF, which is kind of a niche genre.&&I definitely didn't see much marketing and hype-building for it. Not sure if the studio just didn't budget for that or if it ended up being overshadowed by the constant parade of comic book movies that seem to have infinite marketing budgets.&&There‚Äôs just an incomprehensible hazy idea most people have in their heads against high concept sci fi.  I know it‚Äôs hard to believe with Marvel and Star Wars movies being the most popular thing on the planet but non-franchise sci fi still has a ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù stigma to it for stupid reasons.&&Donnie Darko came out just after 9/11. Everyone was at home watching the news for a solid year after that.

(Autocorrect prefers it is called Donnie Dario btw)&&I just watched it last night for the first time - wonderful food porn as well as being a very good character drama.&&Babar is married to his cousin.&&""push in Asian audiences"" is the key phrase.  I just saw a trailer to ""Crazy Rich Asians"" in a ""Mission Impossible"" screening the other night. &&Crazy Rich Asians also has a book, which, to be honest, was crap.

They marketed pretty hard to Asians -- I've been hearing about this movie since it was greenlit! In fact, part of the marketing was putting out a casting call for unknown Asian actors... and you best believe I threw my hat into the ring. (And of course they cast an established actress for the role.) I'm pretty sure that was planned from the start just to build hype -- Jon Chu has done this before.&&Well the person above did say ‚Äúhistorical context,‚Äù which JRC was. Otherwise, it‚Äôs been 25 years, and I‚Äôm glad we have finally another all Asian cast if not a first.&&USC film school is miles better than UCLA. I never even heard anything about the film school while I was at UCLA. UCLA is known for their science and engineering schools because it's a huge research school for the sciences. They lead in like, the medical sciences and eathquake engineering.&&Is there a common UK term for East Asians? Or are they just referenced on a country-by-country basis?&&I mean its very similar. It's not like we're just unfriendly, the Japanese killed 30,000 Filipinos (my great grandparents included) in the Bataan Death March. It's kinda hard to be like ""Oh yeah we're with them!"" after that. 

edit: Fat-fingered a zero &&I agree. I absolutely ***loved*** Burt's sex talk with Kurt as well. I've got that one stored away for when my boys are older.&&goes to show that writing a good minority character isnt just, write a 'default' character and add whatever traits you want. it's well intended advice, but to really be relatable you gotta put in a bit more effort and listen to their unique struggles. and that doesn't always have to mean that everything is super tragic. it's just. harder sometimes.&&Sometimes people tell people they aren't that close to so they don't lose that much if it doesn't go well.&&It's often easier to share your darkest secrets with strangers than the people closest to you. Hurts less if things don't go well for one. Either that or it was something they were open about (or trying to be).&&Absolutely agree. I feel like something happened around the year 2000 where mass media became really white male focused, much moreso than it was even 10 and 20 years before. 

Obviously there were other black sitcoms... The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son, Diff'rent Strokes. Plus Maude, Golden Girls, Mary Tyler Moore all had female leads and focused on female driven storylines. 

But starting in the year 2000-ish it definitely became totally white male dominated, and people who were therefore born around 1990 seem to have gotten really angry about that.

I mean, hell, even in the 1950's I Love Lucy starred a woman and a Cuban immigrant and was the #1 show.  &&Part of that rise of black shows were due to FOX breaking into TV and fighting the big guys in NBC, CBS & ABC.  

FOX had to attract a different audience so they went for shows that other networks weren't going to run, prime time animation like Simpsons, crude adult humour like Married with Children, and black shows that appealed to a black audience like Martin & Living Single. 

Different World, though not on FOX was actually a Cosby Show spinoff that Bill started for Lisa Bonet* to keep her out of trouble, obviously it didn't work out in that regard. &&I've always struggled to put my finger on what thing made me specifically unable to LOVE Black-ish, but you just summed it up best. It's a Black focused Black show, written around the experiences of a Black family in the U.S. and how their Blackness influences their characters' lives. Family Matters (And the Cosby Show,The Fresh Prince, etc.) definitely had moments where the characters' Blackness definitely played into the storyline (Fresh Prince had this in spades), but it wasn't specifically setup with gags and such to make it only that way. &&Same here.  It can't touch the ""original"" (by which I mean the Clooney original, not the terrible Sinatra one), but it was a lot of fun and a lot of ladies I love.  I definitely enjoyed it more than 12 and 13.&&No disagreement. While I have limited knowledge of the curriculums and quality of education, my anecdotal experience watching career outcomes is that USC kids far outperform all other schools in placement in LA. I saw some USC undergrads skip the talent agency step and get assistant jobs at major film studios straight out of school, which is nuts.&&Oriental, but it‚Äôs outdated.

East Asian is Used also.&&Uncomfortably here chink thrown around casually like it‚Äôs 1870.  Welsh people also call Chinese restaurants Chinkies.

Not saying this is an everywhere occurrence in the UK but casual racism towards East Asians seems worse there.&&Don't forget that Filipinos and Americans weren't always so friendly. \~200K+ Filipinos were killed by Americans in the US colonial power days&&Like the fact that I share all of my deepest darkest secrets with internet strangers. &&This is partially confirmation bias on your part. Most of the top shows of the 80s and 90s were about white people. The 80s had Cheers, ALF, Growing Pains, Family Ties, Who's the Boss, Night Court, Happy Days, Wonder Years, Three's Company, and the list goes on. The 90s had Seinfeld, Friends, Frasier, Full House, Roseanne, Home Improvement, Boy Meets World, 3rd Rock from the Sun, The Nanny, and so on.

It's true that the 2000s did not have a marquee sitcom led by a black or female cast. It's important to remember, though, that the 2000s was the decade of reality TV, and that genre was very strongly targeted at female and minority viewers.&&Go back and watch Jurassic Park, with major black, female, and Asian characters. Normal people who happen to be _insert group here_. Hell they even made paleontologists look like normal people. &&It also radiates Big Gay Energy and I love it for that.

The final movie should be winding down the story and wrapping up characters who were already introduced in the previous movies, not adding new characters who will be underdeveloped. One movie will not be enough time to fully develop and fresh out so many new characters who are supposed to be in ""key"" and ""major"" roles. 

Moreover, all these new characters will take time away from the main characters, who are still underdeveloped and need more time to grow and change, (like Rey, who is really a ""static"" character who has not shown any struggle or growth - then again, she does not need to struggle and grow as a character because she started out already perfect and flawless in everything and every way.)&&Please be the Doctor.  Please be the Doctor.&&Lol of course everyone's already complaining. &&Just don't *Laura Dern* him. 

Give him something to do in the movie besides withhold information from other characters. &&Darth Browless&&He looks like he will be in the empire &&Rey's twin brother. &&They really need to stop adding ""major"" characters to these movies. Rey, Poe, and Finn have barely had any meaningful development over the last two films, and their villains Kylo Ren and Admiral Hux aren't doing much better. 

Meanwhile, Episode VIII had Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, BB-8, Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren *and* Hux and added Rose, DJ, Holdo, and Snoke in similarly major roles while also keeping Yoda, Maz Kanata, C-3PO, and Phasma in supporting roles. That's 10 returning main characters, 4 new main characters, and 5 supporting characters contributing to a majorly bloated film where none of them get as much screentime as they should.

So far, Episode IX is set to have Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, BB-8, Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, Hux, Rose, Maz Kanata, C-3PO and possibly Yoda and Billie Lourd's character, that's 15 returning major characters, and is adding Keri Russell, Matt Smith, Dominic Monaghan, Richard E. Grant, Billy Dee's Lando, and Naomi Ackle as main characters, creating a total of 21 characters to keep track of in a trilogy that can't even focus on its main 3. 

For contrast, Episode V had Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2, 3PO, Obi-Wan, and Vader return, adding Lando, Yoda, and *maybe* the Emperor as new characters. Episode VI had those 11 plus Mon Mothma? Nien Nub? Wicket and Ackbar might count, but even then, that's major 13 speaking roles that aren't cannon fodder following two movies that had very tight character arcs vs 21 in a movie that can't decide what to do with Finn.&&You are all reading the title wrong, Key Role is the name of his Star Wars-character. &&I'm guessing pre-scarring Snoke (via flashback).&&Ah yes he plays the role of Dawk-Torhou&&Two star wars threads at the top?

Key point: (one of) the biggest character moment for her in TLJ happens off screen.


After she and Kylo knock each other unconscious over fighting over Anakin's lightsaber she leaves before he even wakes up, meaning there was a moment when Kylo was completely defenseless and she could have just ended him, but she didn't. She still believes in him to the point of not being able to kill him, or at least not being able to kill him while he's defenseless. That's a huge character moment for her, IMO, and it's only implied. It also would've worked as a nice parallel to the other scene where Hux's immediate first thought is to kill Kylo.&&Well the main reason I find it hard to care is she kinda just does everything better than everyone else and the lack of flaws make it hard to root for her and allow her to grow compared to kylo who is very deeply flawed by comparison&&The protagonist embarks on a two film and 5 hour voyage of self discovery.

I could live with that.&&Thrawn would be something like 90 at the time of Episode IX. Chiss have an 80 year life expectancy.&&IIRC her accent shift was explained away after Episode I with Amidala/Padme performing a similar accent shift depending on whether she was acting in a formal ""royal"" or diplomatic capacity (Queen/Princess/Senator) where she would use a 'British' accent but then shift to an 'American' informal accent when in a social capacity. This would explain why Leia speaks with a 'British' accent at the beginning of Episode IV when dealing with Vader and Tarkin but an 'American' accent when she meets with Han and Luke later on and in the subsequent sequels.&&Lucas has gone on record saying he envisioned it as the more British accents being for people who were raised (or at least schooled) closer to the core (where the Empire was based and so where most of their recruits came from) and the American accents being for people from the more rimward planets, where the Rebellion did most of it's recruitment.&&So it‚Äôs not that all British people are imperials / first orderlings.

I'm not trying to bash TLJ but it feels like many of the decisions made were reached without considering the wider context of the trilogy and instead viewing the film in isolation; it's interesting that the Knights of Ren were something Johnson didn't want to touch. &&I fucking hated the boss fight with IG-88 in Shadows of the Empire on the N64.&&They already tried that with phasma &&But the Knights of Ren have fallen flat as their LACK of being in the movies other than mentioned.

This batch has relied on Phasma being cool over hype oh wait we're gonna have her fall flat twice without actually accomplishing anything or the Knights of Ren who ""We're gonna bring them up. Oh? You wanted more?"" Without any buildup.

Like, if there was a core of planets where everyone was rich, educated, and spoke a kind of blended Sino-English language, while everyone in the impoverished outer rim planets spoke (and lived) like rusticated space pioneers.  Watching that would be a gorram delight.&&Stormtroopers generally have American accents throughout, though. I get the idea behind the explanation, but it seems more like a class thing.&&But he uses an American accent. Which means it could be viewed both ways, really.

Stormtroopers as a whole don't really have British accents, now that I think of it. Not even in the first time they talk, in the ""Jedi Mind Trick"" part of the first movie. Only the higher-ranking Imperial officers. It's really more of a posh-commoner divide than a empire-rebels one.&&His American accent is pretty horrible though. Hopefully if they do have him use it he'll get some vocal coaching to improve it&&To him it would be just a malfunctioning screwdriver anyway.&&For someone as young as he is.

I would not call Snoke ‚Äúwasted‚Äù any more than Palpatine was wasted in ROTJ. He was some backgroundless evil guy who existed for how he affected the Luke/Vader relationship.&&I'm convinced Rian didn't give a shit about any of JJ's characters outside of Kylo Ren, whereas JJ clearly has a love for all of the characters he created.

That's why I have a glimmer of hope for 9. I know it's popular to blame TFA for just being a rehash, but it was fun with likable characters. Star Wars fans need to stop expecting anything to be the next Empire. The likelihood of that happening is so small.&&They had her talk too much, and go out like a total punk (in both movies).

Unfortunately, that was brushed away at the by Luke, who I expected to support a more 'grey' side of things. &&I don't know if it was good acting or a bad script, but you could tell right away something was up with him.

Honestly, I like the sequels a little, but I would've preferred a Thrawnish trilogy where the Empire is in the same position as the rebellion. The first movie would have the Republic not treating them as a credible threat anymore, with Leia trying to stop them from being retarded. &&How is he not loyal to the empire? I can see not being loyal to the first order, but his loyalty was with the Emperor. &&And it will be owned by a middle class couple who have a conversation about how they know it was expensive but it just works so much better than any other brand of sphere?&&I'm not with this one.

It does. That arc wasn't necessarily good, but it definitely didn't feel out of place in a Star Wars film.&&As long as you have the scene where Benecio betrays them it still works the way it does in the movie.&&DJ betrayed the Rebels. Without the casino plot they would have 'won' and escaped the First Order.&&They should have gone with writers that worked on the trilogy as a whole, while getting a different director for each film. That would have made more sense.

Snoke's very existence is a mystery that is (or should be) highly important to the narrative.

By far the best thing in TFA were the ""new trio."" I didn't care that it was a pretty obvious rehash of A New Hope, I wanted to see more of Rey and Poe and Finn. Similarly, my biggest complaint for Rogue One was that the characters were so boring.

While I certainly don't hate TLJ as some people do, I was really disappointed that it didn't deliver on the new characters, except perhaps Rey. Finn was a big part of the worst parts of the movie, and Poe... well, I have mixed feelings on how that storyline was handled.

In other words: I very much hope that JJ can make me love these characters as much as I did after TFA.&&I don‚Äôt think anyone was expecting Empire- I think people just wanted an entertaining, coherent story. &&Or JJ was just trying to expand the universe as much as possible to leave room for the next guy with no real plan for any of those characters or plots other than they are mysteries to be solved...later...and by someone else.&&Boba went out like a punk too, but Empire built him up first.

The less we know about the characters, the more we have to focus on the external conflict: Rebels vs Empire. When we see how devoted these characters we hardly know are to a cause, it almost serves to make the cause appear much more important. We don't know much about why they believe what they believe, but they're willing to put their lives on the line for it, so it must be super important. At least that's how I see it. You're free to disagree with me.&&No, I'm not talking about the narrative. You completely missed the point of what I was saying.

The way JJ wrote those characters, their motivations, their interactions with each other was clearly done with a full conception of what they are.

Just because he sets up Rey's parents are a mystery, doesn't mean he didn't make it clear who her character was and what her motivations were.

I also think your concern about Gal Gadot's character is kind of inconsistent with the rest of your concerns. Your concern seems to be that she's voiced by a popular actress and looks like another character. But the choice of voice actress is just how movies work. You get popular and talented voice actors because they can do their jobs well and they generate interest. That's not really anything to be cynical about. If her design looked a lot like Wonder Woman's then I could see the concern. I also seriously doubt that Disney is trying to generate interest to its target audience by alluding to The Fast and The Furious. If the resemblance is purposeful then it's probably more of an homage than a ploy. &&> Wonder Woman's doing a voice and the character design is basically Giselle from Fast and Furious.

> During the film, Shank (who looks exactly like her Fast and the Furious character, Gisele Yashar) will go toe-to-toe with Vanellope, who mastered her own driving skills during the first Wreck-It Ralph film. According to director Rich Moore, Vanellope‚Äôs driving skills impress the hardened street racer and she becomes a sort-of mentor character for her‚Äîsomething that was a natural fit for Gadot, who‚Äôs become an inspiration for thousands of young girls by playing Wonder Woman in the DCEU.

All their movies seem to have a need to comment on old school Disney tropes and critique previous films for all their 'problems'. Like Frozen - 'You can't marry a guy you just met' or Moana making fun of the Princess tropes.  &&The princess clip from the trailer made me cringe,  actually the entire Oh My Disney bit in general. &&I do think everything in the trailers so far besides the last scene where he asks why it's called Ralph breaks the internet will be within the first act of the movie. There's no way it's just 90 minutes of ""look at this reference"" just like how the first movie was not like that. I like how idk anything about the plot beyond the setting.&&Yeah, the trailers have been pretty light on plot so far. Which I actually like. I mean, the trailers are made to get people to watch the movies. When they can do that without spoiling (as in, ruining surprises), all the better. Plot light trailers probably help with that. See also Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, where the big action set piece the entire marketing was build around, took place within the first ten minutes.&&Sounds like the MCU, which according to box office and redditors alike is close to the best thing ever.&&>  It's literally free

I now have about a 3% hope that it will even be good anymore. Just seems like they crammed it full of as many bullshit normie memes and pop culture characters as possible.

The original was a love letter to old gamers, and a surprisingly deep story of friendship, inclusion and sacrifice.

This one seriously looks like it's just gonna be like ""MY NAME A PEEEEEEEWDIEPIIIIIIEEE""

the internet‚Äôs not gonna care.&&If you enjoy power fantasy films, it's not bad. 

It's silly light-hearted fluff. It's the cinematic equivalent of a kid smashing his action figures against each other. If you did that as a kid, and put yourself there, mentally, you will probably find it fun.

&&Apparently if you go in with super low expectations you‚Äôll come away thinking,‚Äùthat wasn‚Äôt so bad.‚Äù &&When I read the book it gave me the impression of willy wonka for ""adults""&&I liked it. It wasn‚Äôt some masterful and complicated film, but an enjoyable move nonetheless.

I definitely don‚Äôt think it was bad, but I didn‚Äôt read the book either so I didn‚Äôt have any expectations.&&I mean that's kinda the plot, yeah: if you gave the internet the power of super immersive VR, what would happen? A giant clusterfuck of memes and characters.&&Eh I don‚Äôt think that is necessarily a bad thing. The question is whether they will overdo it. If they try and subvert expectations too much it will become a trope in and of itself. &&It's not just Disney, we're in the Postmodern era.&&The bigger trope they've had since Bolt is that every movie has to be a team up movie consisting of the following:

* Spunky female
* Jaded Male
* Comic relief animal

And they MUST GO ON AN ADVENTURE

I think only 2 movies since then have broken this mold (Winnie the Pooh and Big Hero 6)&&>All their movies seem to have a need to comment on old school Disney tropes and critique previous films for all their 'problems'.

To an extent, it's an attempt to mollify the kind of people who will otherwise make it their life's mission to burn a movie to the ground if it dare step outside their bleeding edge social views.

&&Now that I think about it, it's kinda weird that 'Oh My Disney' just replaces the word ""God"" with ""Disney"".&&Yeah the first movie advertised all the old video game references in trailers, yet past the first act there was practically no mention of it. &&Oh reddit absolutely has to have their palms greased a bit by plenty of companies.

I see like 2 advertisements on reddit at all times.  Top of the page Featured Ad, and the right sidebar ads.

There's no way those ads and Gold alone do the trick&&After a few minutes of hanging out with the tank men and Solid Snake, Ralph, Venelope, and their new friends eventually come to a door in the ground. The door is surrounded by candles, and is the only thing illuminated in the thousand yards of darkness.

""What's this thing?"" Ralph asks.

""Oh... Uh... It's... It's the one place we must never go,"" Replies one of the tank men. He then points to Venelope, ""especially *you.*""

Venelope is taken aback a bit, but gathers her resolve. She defiantly grimaces at him, ""what? What's down there?""

The tankman looks to Snake, who visibly gulps, and slowly looks at the trap-door. ""*Shadbase.*""

If all you do is continually subvert a genre, trope or theme you wind up with fiction that's missed the point of the original style of work.

The postmodern tradition of turning accepted narrative structures into smoking craters through subversion [can only go on for so long.](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/postmodernism-dead-comes-next/) And the literary tradition that has influence over popular fiction today has already moved on from this.&&tropeception

&&In every film? I think it's a bad thing. It was clever the first time, not the twelve other times afterwards.

That is a subversion that not only retains the original moral, but also enhances certain aspects and applies them to a different context.

[squints eyes]

Seven Spiceberg&&Spielberg did this and Jurassic Park in the same year and that is insane to me &&A little fun fact... Spielberg dropped out of college to concentrate on his career.  He returned 32 years later to finish his degree.  He submitted this movie as his final project.  
Could you imagine the professor  who had to watch hours of crappy student films and grade them to be smacked in the face with this one?&&Great movie that everyone should experience but man is it emotionally exhausting. &&I work in an building literally a block from the Schindler's factory an I visited the museum a number of times. It is really touching and I highly recommend seeing it when you get a chance to visit Krakow &&The final scene in the credits where all the real survivors place the stones on the grave wrecks me every time. Turn into a big ball of tears.&&This movie actually changed my life forever. In my opinion it is Liam Neeson‚Äôs best role. &&The actress that plays the girl in red said she regretted watching the movie herself&&This movie is Spielberg at his most restrained as far as sentimentality. And I think that is what makes this movie so powerful. He simply lets the characters and situations speak for themselves. Compare this to something like ""Lincoln"" that is reverential and almost cute for lack of a better word. ""Schindler's List"" is his masterpiece.&&I plan on seeing it. I sure hope I don‚Äôt find people making out in the theatre during the movie...&&I like to watch this movie in 2 parts. Once on a Friday night then wake up Saturday morning and finish it&&The best movie I never want to see again?

also nominated: requiem for a dream, there will be blood&&The sun will come out, tomorrow!  Oh? OK.  GOOD BYE JEWS!&&I need a date to make out with while watching this movie. &&It's on Netflix where I live and I was planning on watching it soon, but should I wait till this is out so my first time seeing it is in a cinema?&&I rewatch this movie about once a year. It help me put my problems in perspective, and realize that no matter how bad my life gets, it will likely never be as horrifying as what the Jewish people went through in the Holocaust.&&That little girl has always comes to mind first when ever I think about the movie or when it gets brought up it shows the true nature of what actually happened through the holocaust she is only in it for a total maybe 4 mins but is the strongest message of how sad it is &&I don't know which part I'll cry the most at.

- Schindler saying he should have done more
- The modern day Schindler Jews scene when the film switches to color
- The epilogue&&Excellent movie. I visited Schindler‚Äôs factory in Krak√≥w a few weeks back. Also did a tour of Auschwitz 1 and Auschwitz II Birkenau. I recommend a trip for anyone that is visiting Poland.

Also if in Warsaw, visit the Warsaw Uprising museum. I hope one day a movie can be made about the Warsaw uprising, as it‚Äôs a forgotten story that is truly remarkable.&&I have this movie on my shelf in an honored place, but I've never been able to watch it again, because reasons.&&I don‚Äôt know if I can watch this movie again. It‚Äôs one of the most important movies to watch, but I don‚Äôt know if I can deal with it haunting me again. &&I decided to watch it again about a year or so ago. Was heavily inebriated as I was drinking a bit during it, by the end I was a wreck. What a fucking movie, one of the best of all time. 

Random thought, I'd also like to point out how realistic some of the deaths were portrayed. I wonder why this seems to be the only movie that shows a realistic death scene.&&Confession: I called the academy award winning producer of Schindler's list, AT HOME, for my high school freshman English project. 

The teacher said we had to ask questions of someone in the movie business. Crazy assignment considering we lived in the cinematic metropolis of suburban Utah. 

My dad had a very minor work connection with this producer and called him for me. The shame I felt as I realized 1. how little my dad knew him, 2. how rude it was to call him at home, and 3. how stupid of an assignment it was to bother him with is something I will never forget. 

He was very kind, but it will be a relief to one day die and have the shame of that memory fizzle out. üòë&&See the movie you never want to see again..again!&&I heard he replaced all of the Nazi guns with walkie talkies.&&Will there be a remaster? &&I like the scene after the credits where Samuel L. Jackson asks Oskar to join the Avengers. &&Watched this movie in college for the first time with no knowledge of the plot. This super egotistical douche decided to make a redditesque joke about Jews and the Jewish professor shut him down hard. I know this won't get any views but it makes me feel so happy knowing that asshole for our in his place in a tactful way in front of his peers for trying to be funny in the most inappropriate place.&&The first time I saw this movie was probably in high school when I was probably too immature to understand it. Just rewatched like a week ago. Holy shit what a powerful and saddening movie. &&The red jacket was a masterful use of cinema.  So powerful, and yet so subtle. &&Personally, I think showing this very powerful moment in the movie on the poster is poor form. This moment creeps up on you in the film and I think the audience and Oscar share that moment. This poster robs the viewer of that. &&I‚Äôve never seen it and kind of have a staunch rule to not see holocaust movies as my parents are survivors ( and it‚Äôll totally break me ). I might force myself to the theater for this one. &&I visited Krakow and Auschwitz with a tour group last year. Afterwards, our way to Prague, our next stop, we watched Schindler‚Äôs List for the 4hr drive. Every single person on the bus was absolutely silent for the entire ride ‚Äî the weight of what we‚Äôd just seen combined with the film was so enormous.&&I'll never forget the deafening silence as people shuffled out of the theater when that movie ended.&&Don't make out during this movie in front of your local post office worker &&Can‚Äôt wait to watch it again and cry my ass off&&I'm colorblind and totally missed her jacket the first time I saw the movie&&Can't wait! I saw this young. I wasn't aloud to watch R rated movies but my parents understood this movies importance. This was one movie that truly touched me. The end still makes me cry as I write this. Which isn't good as I'm working with kids at the state Fair at the moment and I'm full of boogers lol&&I watched this film the same night I visited Auschwitz. I had never, and never have again, experienced cold like the one at that horrible place. It cut me to my bones. Nothing has made me feel that evil is a quantifiable and measurable commodity like that place has. The air is heavy with it.

I encourage anyone who has the capacity to go. &&GOODBYE JEWS! &&I'm 35. I've read books about the Holocaust, including ""Maus,"" which was fucking brutal. 

I'm actually terrified to watch this movie.&&You were making out during Schindler's List?!&&That font makes it look like a Disney movie&&25 years huh, ja im still not ready for a second viewing.&&The Seinfeld episode about this movie was on last night! &&Great episode of this american life you should checkout about this.

**Schindler‚Äôs List 25th anniversary: if you don‚Äôt buy a ticket you‚Äôre a nazi Trump supporting jew-hater! **&&lol that tagline gimme a break&&Does Schindler have a specific set of skills tho&&This is one of my favourite movies. This is a movie I can stomach to watch more than once.&&That girl in the red jacket haunts my nightmares to this day! üò≠&&Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary in this film . He got robbed imo. Still one of my favorite performances, despite the character he played. &&When I was a sophomore or junior in high school, they made us walk to the small private college next door and watch this movie in their big auditorium. With Holocaust survivors. It was so difficult to hold back the tears (which I tried to do because, you know, high school and embarrassment).

Edit: reading through some of the other comments, this was a Catholic school, and they didn't skip any scenes. I believe they did it every year, we had lunch with the seniors(meaning elderly)/Holocaust survivors in attendance (large Jewish community in the area) and some of them did a discussion as well. So I guess good for my school.&&ITT: Idiots who think a re-release of a film about the Holocaust is a dig at the current US Administration.

&&God damn it Louis CK, now all I can think of is your bit about the little girl.&&I hope they've replaced all the guns with walkie talkies.&&""Needs now more than ever""? A little overdramatic, don't you think?

I'm excited because I love the movie, but pretending today is anything like the holocaust is disingenuous at best.  &&‚ÄúA story of courage that the world needs now more than ever.‚Äù

Squidward Tentpoles&&The oft-forgotten Spice Girl.&&Se√±or Spielbergo &&For such a HUGE named director, why did they almost hide his name? &&Director of such films as:

Munch, I Miss Dad, Brides of Spice (an autobiography), Mork, and Dash Me if You‚Äôre Sand.&&Why do they need that text? Is there anyone who's saying ""I don't know about this Spielberg fellow but it says he won an Academy Award so I guess I'll see it""?&&He said if he has done Schindler's first he probably wouldn't have made a dinosaur movie.&&He also took no money for Schindlers List as he said it would be blood money. It instead all went to Jewish charities, estimated $25 mil.&&The Lost World and Amistad as well. Weird years.&&He was, in fact, going to do one single movie about the Dinosaur Holocaust when the Nazi Meteorite hits the earth (Mexico, actually) and kills the Jewish Dinosaurs. But then he tripped and his papers got split up in two heaps.&&It's also the year he finally graduated film school.&&He also made Munich and War of the Worlds in the same year, using the same process (""shoot the drama while the blockbuster is in postproduction"").&&I like to imagine some obscure college professor giving Steven Spielberg a B minus. &&was curious so looked it up. looks like he did submit it, but in 2002 when he went back. the movie was released in 1993. ""it retroactively turned 'Schindler‚Äôs List' into the greatest student film ever made.""&&""Too long, requirements are 15-20 minutes.""

""Clearly over budget.""

""Not identifiable to a modern audience, clich√© use of black-white film contrasted with use of color. Derivative.""&&Thanks for fucking the curve *Steve*.&&I don't know. Hate to be a pooper but I feel they'd have been more than aware Spielberg was formally doing the class for the sake of it and by the stage of the final project gone ""And now let's see what *Spielberg movie* Spielberg has submitted... yep... Schindler's List... goodness me, he gets an A, wow, look at that. Ok now onto the actual students...""&&I didn‚Äôt know that - that would be unreal&&I'd be disappointed as hell if I were his professor. I would've wanted something new.&&I‚Äôm willing to bet the professor had seen it already haha&&wow i went to CSULB where he finished his degree and didn‚Äôt know he submitted Schindler‚Äôs List as his final project.&&hah, in some colleges this would be classified as plagiarism or at least unethical and get you disciplined. &&Oddly enough my film teacher in college hated Schindler's List.  He one went on a long rant about how Spielberg stole it from another director, i think Billy Wilder but not sure, and ruined it.  Later in the semester i actually got into a fairly heated conversation about A.I. with him and his TA since i am one of the few people who likes that film.&&It was part of the curriculum at my school, every student had to watch it. &&Its one of the few movies I've outright cried at. Not even during the movie itself, though the ""I could have saved more"" scene came close. Just after the movie was over, the weight of it just hit me. You hear about the holocaust and how terrible it was, but seeing what it actually was like for these people, that anyone could cause or allow such a tragedy, its overwhelming. &&I watched this with my girlfriend the day before we took a tour around Auschwitz.  

So people in our hostel walked in on us in the common room, crying in a corner, and then utterly depressed for the next few days.&&Easily the best film I never want to watch again. Ever.&&I'm feeling a chill just looking at the poster and thinking of my experience. It was a ""Oh, I'm bored and this is coming on so I'll watch it to pass the time"" moment to me chilling out on the floor watching it and just having an endless stream of wtfwtfwtfwtf in my mind. I was a kid too so it was a lot to take in.&&...just like the holocaust, I would imagine.&&Schindlers List and Mississippi Burning are two very important movies that everyone should watch exactly one time. If you can manage to watch them again, you may be a robot. &&For my dad and i, we agree its the once every ten years type of movie. If we feel like being masochistic to our emotional wellbeing for that day. &&My brother went through a phase for like a month in like 2003 where he watched this movie almost every single day. It was always on. He would (and sitlll) play the soundtrack and the songs are just so beautifully composed.&&It is one of the few, perhaps the only movie that gets me sobbing every single time I watch it. My dad‚Äôs parents survived the Holocaust, and both sets of grandparents lost most of their families in the concentration camps. I‚Äôve only heard a few stories about their experiences, so watching Schindler‚Äôs List feels like transporting back in time and watching the horrors my ancestors experienced. It tears me apart every time, but it‚Äôs such an important film. Especially now. 

Edit for sausage fingers.&&We loved the Schindler's factory walk around....very informative and massively overlooked by most people&&Have you visited the Schindlers List movie set of the Plaszow Camp? Spielberg rebuilt the Plaszow camp in the quarry next to the real camp and you can still see the remainings of the movie set like the tombstone street, fences, barb wire and the grounds of Amon G√∂ths villa (The real one is still intact aswell, its close the real camp). Worth a visit.&&Visit Krakow in general... incredible city. 

You're lucky to work in such a nice part of town!&&I lose it when Liam Neeson breaks down because he feels he could have done more.
‚ÄúThis car, Goeth would have bought this cat. Why did I keep the car? Ten people right here. Ten people. Ten more people.‚Äù&&For me the ending redeems the pain of the rest of the movie. Each time I‚Äôve seen it it makes me feel like I‚Äôve achieved something by suffering through this brilliant film. And with my family‚Äôs history, it makes me feel grateful that they struggled to survive so my dad could be born, so I could be born, so my daughter could be born. Growing families are what the survivors wanted, more than anything. Loss replaced by gain. The pain doesn‚Äôt go away, but it‚Äôs lessened, and there‚Äôs room for joy. That‚Äôs how I feel during the ending, just a massive catharsis and a feeling of ‚ÄúOK, they survived, I can deal with this comparatively petty BS in my life and do some good for the world in the process.‚Äù &&The only time a movie has ever made me cry.&&I actually watched it again for the first time in nearly 15 years. The ending scene still gets me, but now being a dad, the scene where they are leading the kids to the train while the music plays and they are waving goodbye to the parents just destroys me. I couldn't imagine...&&Fuck man. You managed to wreck me all over again just thinking about it. I've only watched that movie once. I don't think I have it in me to do it again. &&My sophomore year in high school, we had a holocaust survivor come and speak to us. She spoke of the two death marches she survived and the conditions of the camps she was held. I believe one was Dachau but don't quote me on that. It was tough listening to her story. This was for a specific class too, not like a school wide assembly, it was just our class in the library with her so it was super personal and she answered all of our questions. Being older now, i feel bad that i dont remember her name. She's probably passed sense, that was about 14 years ago.&&The line during that scene that read something along the lines of ""Today, less than 4,000 Jews live in Poland. The Jews Schindler saved now have 6,000 descendants around the world."" 

I had to leave the room so my SO didn't see me blubbering like a dolphin. The fact that he indirectly saved more Jews than the amount currently living in Poland is astounding.&&Yes that part is like automatic crying every time.&&When they give him the rung is when i lost it.

Spielberg deliberately had him drop it and then *frantically* pick it back up to show his appreciation and emotion.

Gets to me. &&I also think it's Ralph Fiennes' best role too.  Incredible performance.  Every time I see him, it's a shadow of his performance in this movie.&&Idk have you seen *Taken 3*?  &&Me too.  After watching this movie, I cold-turkey stopped trying to eradicate the jews.&&He was cast in the role because he was always making lists.&&Bro, have you not heard of a man named Qui-Gon Jinn

/s&&Incredible that he got the role due to his actual real life love of making lists. 

Shame he has full blown AIDS though. &&According to Wikipedia, the girl was 3 at the time of filming, and Spielberg asked her to wait until she was 18 to watch the film.

*Narrator: ""She didn't"".*

She apparently watched it when she was 11 and was horrified - but upon seeing it again as an adult, she was proud of the role.

This is all explained in [this article.](https://www.theobserver.ca/2013/03/05/red-coat-girl-traumatized-by-schindlers-list/wcm/3d7460c6-2e61-4135-a230-e361f9061b58)&&GOODBYE JEWS!&&Why so?&&Holy shit I first saw this as a college-age kid and it was emotionally devastating. But now having a daughter the same age as this character it is a whole nother level.&&Munich is his grownup movie. Beautifully done and sentimentality is at a minimum.&&Schindler's List is the one where the coda worked for the movie. Saving Private Ryan didn't need it, with the did I do good shtick. Lincoln should have ended when he walked down the hall, and did the penny pose, we didn't need the assassination aftermath, we knew that was happening.

Schindler's List, it worked. &&To be fair it is very like Spielberg to make a movie about winning during the holocaust.

That being said, I am still a huge fan of the movie.&&The people downvoting you have obviously never seen Seinfeld &&And a more offensive spectacle I cannot recall!&&Reminds me of when I visited Auchswitz over the summer and spotted a man taking pictures of his girlfriend/wife while she posed sexily on the train tracks.

If it's convenient I'd say definitely see it in a theater, if not you'll have a pretty similar experience at home.&&I'd say wait. I personally want to watch it like every year, and it's on Netflix in the US, but whenever my friends and I are browsing through Netflix for something to watch I ALWAYS suggest Schindler's List and they look at me like

&&If you‚Äôre curious, the little girl is based off of Roma Ligocka, and you can read her memoir. It‚Äôs called *The Girl in the Red Coat.* It discusses her time both in the Warsaw ghetto and how the war affected her in her 20s and 30s with Poland being behind the Curtain. To this day it‚Äôs the only non-fiction / memoir book that I actually enjoy. It‚Äôs fascinating. &&‚ÄúI should have done more‚Äù while surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of eternally grateful Jews he saved chokes me up, too. Imagine all the folks alive today thanks to him. &&I went to the factory museum a few years ago and came away with a sour impression of Schindler. That museum does him few favors. But I am also glad that they did not whitewash those things about him.&&We all share those reasons. I watched it on TV in 1996 or so, and it destroyed me. It's seared into memory. Now that I have a family of my own, I think I'd be even more destroyed by it. Even reading about the Holocaust is extremely difficult.

That said I hope we all take those feelings of horror, anger, and sadness and keep them fresh, motivating us to action before our current situation enables another Holocaust to be perpetrated. &&I remember when it first came out and there was all this scandal due to the local schools taking 7th and 8th grade students (12/13 yo) to see it. By the time I reached that age they didn't show it. I remember it being on tv as my parents watched it but we weren't allowed. I remember sneaking out of bed and seeing the girl in the red coat scene and being rushed off to bed again. 

I didn't actually watch it until a couple years ago in my late 20's. My god was it harrowing, but such a powerful story that needed to be told. I find the hardest scene to be the one where Schindler laments he could not save more. Liam Neeson was a power house in this film. 

I'm actually looking forward to the chance to see this now in theatres. I worry that many will over look it and they are probably the one's that need to see it the most. If they do go, I hope it changes them for the better. &&I watch this film coz its well made and a true narrative of important events 

It doesn't haunt me though, I have watched it several times, its one of many films I occasionally go to to watch because they are worth it

Maybe im desensitised, I understand the importance and horror of the events the film depicts and if it were happening to me i know how terrible it would feel, how horrifying, 
but its just a film, 

everyone here is saying they never want to watch it again, that annoys me, its too damn good to never see again &&Just the way people crumple onto the ground when they were shot fucking scarred me tbh&&Spielberg wanted it to be hard to watch.    

Either him or someone on his staff considered doing the whole film with people speaking their native language with subtitles, but they opted out of it because they felt it would give people a reason to look away from it.    

Compare that to a very different style like Quentin Tarantino. When you watch someone die in a Tarantino movie, he wants to go, ""Holy Crap!"" and be entertained by it, not scarred by it.    

See also Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan (also Spielberg as I'm sure most know).&&What did you ask and what did he say about it btw?

Also: From what other people say about Spielberg's personality, I think you shouldn't be too hard on yourself about that shame since he sounds like the kinda guy who'd always make time for kids and their silly questions.&&Does it need one?

(Note this is the exact size it is in the full credits at the bottom of the poster.)

I bet that for newer Spielberg movies there‚Äôs a special clause in a contract somewhere that lets them market the film with the director‚Äôs name more prominently, but they didn‚Äôt do this originally for this film and nobody wants to redo the contract or pay anyone anything for the re release. 

That‚Äôs my guess. Someone who knows tell me if it‚Äôs right!!!&&I Miss Dad

üòÇ&&Universal only green-lit Schindler's List on the condition he finish JP first.&&Still never watched Amistad. Should I? &&Spielberg was all over the place in the 90's. An experienced director busting his ass and putting out some of his most influential work.&&And he did Tintin and War Horse the same year. &&I think something like that happened to Michael Crichton before he hit it big. He thought a professor wasn't grading his papers as highly as he should have been. So with permission from another professor, he submitted a paper written by a well-known and acclaimed writer... and he got a B-.

Edit: It was George Orwell.

*Crichton was on the stand Thursday trying to protect his pocketbook and convince a jury that he would never steal another person's script. Then he let slip the oops: During his sophomore year at Harvard, he cribbed a paper by the acclaimed 1984 novelist.*

*Of course, Crichton said it was an experiment, not a scandal. (Bet that made his lawyers feel better.)*

*You see, Crichton thought his professor was stiffing him on grades, so after telling another faculty member of his scheme, he put his prof to the test and borrowed the Orwell essay.*

*""I was getting C-pluses,"" the √ºber-novelist told jurors. ""George Orwell got a B-minus.""*&&Yeah I‚Äôm really curious on the grade now. Sure it was probably an A+, but we‚Äôre talking film here which is always somewhat subjective &&Then how he take credit for everything Steven knows?&&Yeah the professor would say it was only in black and white, instead of color, and give a B minus. &&Oh wow... I never looked into it.  I just thought it was a great story.  In my mind there was this professor sitting home on a Friday night reviewing student film and mumbling to himself, ""What shit storm do I have to sit through now?""&&That‚Äôs basically plagiarism! Submitting old work for new grade smh ^^^^/s&&Feels a bit like cheating tbh.&&[deleted]&&to be fair, at the time the ""cliche use of black white film contrasted with color"" wasnt much of a thing. could be argued this film is what made it a thing/created the cliche. it had been done before, but certainly not overdone.

i know that kind of takes away from an otherwise good joke, though.&&Yea, ppl aren‚Äôt understanding that this was well after Steven made these movies and was a huge filmmaker, it wasn‚Äôt like he started making movies in his 50‚Äôs

He went back to school 32 years later &&Which frankly defeats the purpose of him doing it anyway if you ask me. If you're going to just submit something you made a decade earlier, doesn't that just demonstrate this class was a bit of a waste of time for you?&&Plot twist. It was an old episode of America's funniest home videos with a shindlers list label.&&My hasidic school forbid us from watching it because they were concerned we would become aroused by the naked holocaust women

*edit*

They also created a gender segregated holocaust museum in Brooklyn that contains no images of female victims

He encouraged us to watch it on our own time, but he said he was prohibited from showing us in class&&I watched it for school at \~12 years old and I had to pause it and walk away a couple times.  And this was watching a poor quality 4:3 VHS tape.  Seeing it in theaters or on Blu-ray back then would've been all the more potent I bet.&&I had to write an essay on how Schindler‚Äôs List and The Matrix have a lot of the same story and tonal similarities it was pretty cool. Watched both the movies over 5 classes &&Schindler's list must be this generation's *Roots*. We all had to watch that when I was in school back in the mid 90s.&&same here, along with the diary of anne frank, just without the chapters about her probably being a lesbian or at least bi and leaving out all the dirty jokes she wrote.&&I was the same way after I watched it. The movie itself was moving, but the footage they filmed of the survivors visiting Schindler's grave just wrecked me like no other movie had before.&&Saw it in the theater when it was released with a few friends of mine - we were seniors in high school at the time. The ""I could have saved more"" scene just broke all of us. Not even holding back our tears. Five high school dudes just sitting there devastated under the weight of it all&&I remember the haunting thought I had after seeing the movie in the theater as a teen: there's nothing stopping that from happening again.

There was a particular scene where I think they were burning bodies, and some Nazi soldiers were mugging for the camera full of pride, and I realized that a large portion of our society (in the US, but also anywhere) just likes the camaraderie of defeating others and have no qualms about causing pain and destruction to anyone they don't know. I was sure that some percentage of my fellow high school students would cheer on a similar slaughter if the socio-political conditions were right. They'd be the ones mugging for the camera as bodies burned. And that thought kept me awake at night.

Sometime in the late 90's I started thinking maybe I was wrong. Maybe the world was really getting permanently better. But at this point, I've already seen people cheering the pain and suffering of ""the others"".  It seems almost inevitable we'll sink to that level of horror again.&&> we took a tour around Auschwitz.

...and now i'm reminded of the still visible finger nail marks scratched into the walls of one of the gas chambers.&&No ""Dear Zachary: A letter from a father to his son"" is the one you'll never watch again. It will break you in two.&&Spielberg is maybe the greatest master of emotional manipulation ever to work in cinema. If he could make you cry your eyes out at a [rubber alien in a river,](http://www.moviefanfare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ET.jpg) Schidler's List is what happens when he turns his powers towards something actually worth crying about.&&I started watching it at home once.  Got to the scene where he sees the red coat on the pile of clothes in the concentration camp, I completely broke down, then turned it off. Haven't seen the rest of it.&&Actually I find it a bit disturbing that it's become a de facto ""true"" recreation of the Holocaust. It's a great film, but it is a work of fiction made in the 1990s. It also has flaws.  The main story is not about Jews, but instead the hero's journey of a Good German that acts heroically to save Jewish lives.  A true story of course, but is this the best representation of German behavior during the Holocaust?  Schindler was an exception.  The vast majority of Germans, most of Europe (and a large part of America) responded to Hitler's Final Solution by either not giving a shit about Jews being gassed in ovens or cheering it on.  Schindler's List also features the wonderful ""gas chamber is actually just a shower"" moment that is a total Spielberg cop out.  I understand the narrative needs not to completely overwhelm the audience with tragedy, as Spielberg remains a populist filmmaker at heart even here, but this is an absurd avoidance of the truth of what happened. I recommend ""Night and Fog"" or ""Shoah"" for far more accurate and potent films about the Holocaust. Schindler's List remains an extremely well made quasi-fantasy about the redemption of a Christian. &&It's the moment where he finally removes his Nazi party pin that gets me.  
He then looks at it and says:  
> This pin. Two people. This is gold. Two more people. He would have given me two for it, at least one. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. I could have gotten one more person... and I didn't! And I... I didn't!&&*Stern shakes his head* ""There will be generations because of what you did.""&&Everything built up to that moment of his character arc, so you're one of many to have been able to make it the whole time and lose it at that one.&&That was where I finally lost it. My eyes got a little watery while watching the movie but when Liam Neeson broke down in the film is where I finally broke down.&&> Goeth would have bought this cat

Goeth did love cats.&&I can not watch the scene were they take the children away in the truck and the kids are waving and smiling while the women lose it. It hurts to think about how painful this must have been.&&Yeah that's what made me lose it, because the main character finally loses it. If this didn't come before the credits scene with the survivors I bet that one would have done it too.&&If you've never looked up the story of Chiune Sugihara, you should.  A similar moment on the train platform throwing signed blank visas out the window and apologizing profusely.&&""There will be generations because of what you did.""

&&A teacher I had once said if you don't cry when watching this film there is something wrong with you.  I have to agree.  &&No wonder the mothers all broke from the line and ran toward their children, even with armed Nazi guards everywhere &&Or the kids hiding everywhere.

Remember how evil we can be and always strive to be good. &&I'm still a little scared of Ralph Fiennes in any movie he's in, because this role is always in the back of my mind. Doesn't matter how benign the role, I still have to remind myself he's not a Nazi. &&He was fucking ROBBED by Tommy Lee Jones at the Oscars.&&One of the best villains ever put to film.

&&It's been a common theme within the last year or two for movies and shows to incorporate that sort of tagline.

I once failed a class in college, but my final paper got a B+.  I had to retake it, and the second time through I was averaging a C.  I only needed to pass (freshman year prerequisite) so I asked the teacher if I could just resubmit that paper, take the same B+, and then pass the class.  They thought about it for like 3 days and eventually decided that yes, I could ... BUT I had to CITE MYSELF AND MY ORIGINAL PAPER EVERY SINGLE PARAGRAPH.  It was the most insane thing in the world.  The original paper obviously wasn't published, it was basically a book report.&&That is the joke. It doesn't take away from it, because that's already the joke.&&The more amazing thing was the school allowed him to use credits from 32 years earlier. I have trouble getting university credits accepted at community college. &&there was something particularly un-bonerific about seeing a bunch of horrified, scared-for-their-lives naked ladies getting locked in a chamber and you as the audience fully expecting them to get gassed, only for them to not.

methinks your school missed the forest for the trees.&&Lol, I'm amused by the school's logic here. 

Holocaust Women: *Filthy, starved, crying, but also naked*

Schoolboys: AWOOGA! AWOOGA!&&When I was in a film studies course in high school, the very first day of class, we were all given a permission slip to be sent home. It included every movie in the curriculum. It was an all-or-nothing sort of thing. My parents signed it and sent me back to school.

Near the end of the year, the time came to watch Schindler's List. I was actually out of school because I was sick so I ended up watching the movie on my own on Netflix (not sure if it's still on there or not). When I came in the following, week, ready to discuss it, I discovered that the teacher had been forced to skip any scene involving nudity. This, of course, included the iconic shower scene which is probably one of the more important moments in the movie.

I was furious. Every single human being in the classroom had their permission slip signed. There was not a single parent who'd be calling the school, angry because their beloved child had witnessed something like that. And yet, the school district had forced my teacher to censor it.

At that point, why even watch Schindler's List? Film Studies had been a very mature class in which everyone in it was capable of dissecting the products as literature, arguably even art. I can think of no greater movie than Schinder's List that demonstrates this point. Either show everyone the whole damn thing, or none of it at all. Anything in between is blatant disrespect for not only the movie, but the Holocaust itself. If we're going to be shown the evils that man is capable of, show us *all* the evils.

This was a few years ago but I'm still pissed off.&&that's literally the least sexy movie scene i can think of lmao

like that scene scared me more than any horror movie i've ever seen

they had to be projecting somehow&&Yeah, but the scene were Schindler is boning that chick and the guy knocks on the door is pretty racy. &&I cannot tell you what solidified my knowledge that I was different from my peers more than being in high school and watching this movie after school. We had a great teacher who showed a bunch of movies for context on things (Last of the Mohicans, Glory, Schindler‚Äôs List, etc.), and every kid who wanted to come had to get parents to sign off.

Well, they showed Schindler‚Äôs list and our teacher stepped out before a scene with the naked prisoners. So that happens, and I‚Äôm watching it, mortified. Then a group of ten dickheads in the back start with ‚ÄúDamn! Titties!‚Äù Which devolves into talk about how they‚Äôre Jews, and rooting for the Nazis to rape them. That‚Äôs where are teacher came back in.

Took me four more years before I got to see how that movie ended. &&That is so horribly fucked up in so many different levels I can't even think up something witty to say... &&Same here, litvish. Where are you from, Williamsburg?&&Go to a school board meeting and ask them what's the deal with that. I recall that the Holocaust scenes of the TV miniseries War & Remembrance were equally if not more graphic, and those were broadcast on network TV in the '80s.&&My wife was a social studies teacher and would show Schindler‚Äôs List and then Hotel Rwanda for her 11th grade classes.&&This is almost insulting. Do you go to school in the deep south? No hate just wondering how someone can ignore a HUGE piece of art and history because of nudity.&&Damn, 12 years old is a little young for Schinders List. Its an important movie to watch, and it should be shown in school, but Id say in Highschool. &&Saw it in the theaters when it came out. Not a single person moved during the credits, or for a good 30 seconds after the lights came up. Major emotional gutpunch of a movie, as it needed to be.&&What if I told you 
 
The camps won't help your concentration&&To be fair, if the world needs Schindler's List ""now more than ever"", it seems like we could probably also use a Roots rerelease.&&Honestly while it may be hard to tell, especially with modern news thriving off of negatively and fear tactics, the world as a whole is more peaceful than it's ever been. Dont get me wrong, horrible things happen on a daily basis and we have a long way yet to go, but statistically we are better off than we have ever been. With how much countries have to lose, and how destructive and quick a world war 3 would be, I dont think we will see that scale of warfare again. 

The scare now is how long we can keep up modern day of living with a planet being drained of resources and being irreversibly harmed by our Impact. I haven't lost hope that even that can be fixed however.&&It was horrifying.   
There's logically knowing something terrible exists/has happened, and then there's seeing it with your own eyes.  

It was the shoes that really got to me.  
Piles and piles of shoes.  &&[deleted]&&[removed]&&Yup, every time there is a thread about what is the hardest movie you ever watched, or what is a film that you will never watch again I chime in or look and see if anyone mentioned Dear Zachary. I made the major mistake of watching it two weeks after my son was born. It fucking wrecked me. I'm talking, like sobbing and can't catch my breath wrecked me. I've never had a film impact me more emotionally than that film. Just the sheer failure of the system that led to what happened was so fucking infuriating and tragic. &&Precious is pretty heartbreaking too!&&I mean, I don't want to watch Schindler's List *or* Dear Zachary again. Also: Dancer in the Dark and Grave of the Fireflies.

All great, great films to watch once.&&It's hard, but it's also worth it.

One of the few films on my all-time favorites list that I don't watch more than once every 5 years. It doesn't get any easier, but it's always been worth it.&&He wasn't a ""Good German"", though.  He was a war profiteer and someone determined to make money off of slave labor who changed his mind and gave all of it up to save people.  It's not just about the holocaust it's about how we can all turn from doing the wrong thing, even after we've picked the wrong side.&&It also doesn't explicitly make clear what happens to the children when they're going away on the trucks blissfully unaware they're being separated from their mothers. Then you see some kids hide in a toilet never to be shown again. &&I actually loved the gas chamber fake out. The build up and suspense of the scene was agonizing. When the lights went off and everyone screamed, the tension was palpable. He crafted the scene in such a specific way, full of tension, that to actually kill them in that scene would have almost been too much.

&#x200B;

To instead have the chamber be mass showers was a way to kind of have both. The movie needed a sense of relief at some point and the moment the water came on was such a release of tension. It's tough to watch movies that have no tension relief&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&That whole bit was his best performance in the film. I rewatched it last week and had forgotten what an opportunist he was at the start. Watching him transform to the point where in the end he broke down at the end it‚Äôs such a emotionally charged moment. &&Take a look at Itzhak just before Schindler breaks down. You can see him slowly and sadly shake his head. He *knows* what's coming.&&Fucking christ. I'm crying even just reading this!&&I cried buckets after watching this scene 
Buckets and buckets&&Oh fuck, I was doing okay until right here. Fuck me, that line punches me in the gut every time.&&I'm not crying,  you're crying. Okay, I might be crying just a little bit.&&Or when he presents the ring. ""It's Hebrew from the Talmud. It says He who saves one life saves the world entire.""&&I think a lot of it is that Schindler was a really regular guy -- he's not an especially bad person who goes along a redemption arc, and he's not an especially good person who had some heroic story of working tirelessly to save the Jews. He starts off as just this pretty mediocre guy who gets Jewish workers because they're cheap but he treats them okay because he doesn't really care one way or the other. And then he just starts gradually caring about them. 

So he's an extremely relatable character for most people, and when you get to this scene, you can't help but glance around at all the stuff you have and think, ""Jesus, what do I need this FitBit for? That's $100 right there, I could have provided clean water to a family Africa for a year with that, and I didn't!""&&It's not just the character arc, though. The scene is just a really good combination of great acting and great music. I watched the full film after seeing just that scene on Youtube, and I was crying even though I had literally no idea who Schindler was at the time&&I have to remind myself that he's not Voldemort.
&&Apparently Fiennes was so convincing, he brought some PTSD back for some of the survivors on set:

Can someone explain it to me like a whale?&&It was all just for show. A school would do anything just to say that Spielberg graduated from there.

Some morons will just see tits. &&It's interesting the shower scene is considered iconic now, on release Spielberg was criticized for using a horrible method of execution essentially to get a rise out of people (when it turned out to actually be a shower).

Oof. Ouch. Owie. Right in the How-Fucking-Old-Am-I-Again.&&[deleted]&&That is ridiculous.  Back when i was a kid [NBC](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/schindlers-list-shown-uncut-on-network-television) aired the movie completely uncut and commercial free.&&Anyone who thinks that scene has the potential to be arousing is a pervert.&&Well there were one or two ‚Äútraditional‚Äù nude scenes. Let‚Äôs give the devil his die. &&She's very hot too.&&God, that pisses me off -_- one of my history classes showed The Pianist. We got to the scene where the Nazi threw the guy in a wheelchair out a window cause he wouldn‚Äôt stand for the officer and I heard a few kids in the back of the classroom start laughing. I wish my teacher would‚Äôve pulled them out for a good talk or something.&&Bork Park. Then Flatbush. Then lakewood.  Then bacon&&""This material can be taught in a way other than a Hollywood movie."" They're not wrong, but movies are also a powerful learning tool. &&Shit, *nobody* mentions War and Remembrance anymore.  Those Holocaust scenes were difficult.  One part that sticks with me was the Jews being forced to dig up the years-old corpses buried in a mass grave, and then check the bodily orifices of children for hidden gold.  Christ.&&Back to back uplifting holiday films for the whole family!&&It could be the schools fault or the consequence of repeated helicopter parents throwing a fit. My middle school English teacher was proud of himself for having a curriculum that I guess was considered fairly ""adult"" and ""challenging"" for 7th and 8th graders. I remember this kid's mom unleashing holy hell on the school because her precious son was reading The Scarlet Letter and Oedipus Rex. He had to really fight to not have to change the reading list for the rest of us. You would hope the school would try and back the teacher up but I'd imagine after a while they may just give in.

Having a kids parents sign a permission slip seems like a better alternative than outright banning stuff like this though.&&[deleted]&&I do remember watching it was elective with parental permission.  Might've done it for extra credit or something.

In high school, my sophomore year I think, we did a full Holocaust Studies class&&High school film teacher here. I‚Äôd never be able to show this movie in my class (as much as I‚Äôd like to). There is a rule at my school that says absolutely no rated R movies. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same everywhere though.&&I think it depends, I think in some places it might not be that jarring of an experience because you're allowed to watch more adult stuff earlier on, like we watched The Elephant Man in 4th grade. So when we also watched Schindler's List around that same age we obviously recognised it is sad and heavy, but I don't think it was too early. &&Haven't seen Dear Zachary but Requiem For a Dream left both me and my wife emotionally drained. After it was done, we let the credits roll, we let the dvd go back to the main menu and we didn't move or talk for the next 15-20 minutes. My first words were: ""let's watch Bambi or something less traumatic like that"". We ended up watching South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut...

I have not experienced that with any other movie, ever.&&Also, Grave of The Fireflies.&&I had to write about Requiem for a Dream for film class at college. As a consequence watched it at least 10 times. After the 3rd or 4th viewing you get past the emotional gut punch of it and notice the details. Ellen Burstyn's phenomenal performance. The DVD extras. Interviews with the author of the book (Hubert Selby), the commentary track - well worth diving into.
&&Compared to the other ""Good Germans"" that western pop culture tends to celebrate (like Rommel or von Stauffenberg), Schindler was a saint. 

It always bugs me that Germans who were opposed to Hitler from before the war or refused to serve Nazi Germany get short shrift&&>You seem to have a problem with the portrayal of a good German, like this isn't supposed to exist.

The point being made here isn't entirely about the film itself, but the fact that this particular story has become the de facto singular narrative about the holocaust to a large portion of the world, who are unlikely to examine this event further than through popular culture like Schindler's list. 

The film succeeds in a lot of ways and absolutely is a story worth portraying, but it's position in societies understanding of genocide (which isn't really the responsibility of the filmmaker and is a difficult thing to ""criticize"" exactly) is definitely one that would be better served by a different film. 

I like Stanley kubrick's take on it, which is essentially that Schindler's list is about the success of the small number that survived, but the Holocaust is about the failure of humanity, and this means that it isn't ideally suited for the position it's taken in popular culture, even though it is a great film. 

I think something like Son of Saul would give the average person who won't look into it much more than that a better picture of the Holocaust than Schindler's list.&&I'm not the one confusing a movie with a documentary.  The fans of Schindler's List are. &&It‚Äôs not your fault.&&goddamnit someone is chopping onions at my desk. &&I think it was the most impactful scene, but he did more great (and more subtle) acting in other scenes, imho. That said, he was pretty great throughout the movie. &&The true story doesn't have the character growth, but Schindler was always a good person. From what I've read, his goal was always to save Jewish people from the camps, and just pretended to be an opportunist to keep himself out of trouble, so he could keep helping. &&Gut punch. I wasn't emotionally prepared for this thread. &&""I could have gotten one more"".
Damn I always cry at that bit.&&I believe all of Schindler‚Äôs subsequent business ventures were utter failures, as well. He likely could have lived anywhere in wealth and comfort after the war, had he not spent everything saving more than one thousand lives. He absolutely made the right choices during the war, eventually.&&That's kind of the irony of it, we look at him and his story as a hero of his time, thinking or hoping we would do the same, yet here we are able to save a life for much less effort and with no risk or repercussion. But that new iPhone looks pretty dope.&&Totally agreed, everyone starts out in mediocrity and self-perseverance like that. But it's what he sacrificed and did afterwards that distinguishes him from those that have not been given the opportunity to make that choice or those that would have decided against what he did. Point being, he was still a great person at the end of the day, and his choice to save the Jews should all be something we should strive for. &&I have to remind myself that he's not Harry with his cunt-fucking kids.&&I have to remind myself that he‚Äôs not The Red Dragon.&&You are correct. As far as I know, Tommy Lee Jones didn't swipe the statue directly from his hands.&&Crash is such a joke. It‚Äôs a one time watch that makes you think about race relations for a minute. 

Then you go and watch a real movie about race relations. &&How can you leave off Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Fucking Ryan. &&DISTURBING THE PEACE (2016), dirs. Stephen Apkon & Andrew Young.

Very interesting doc, fair to both sides.&&Hey, you should apply for a job at that website. You're at *least* as good as their writing staff.&&[deleted]&&I agree, it is sad. It is not a thing you'd like to be right about. But the more people who are aware, the less in vain all those who died at the hands of their regime is the way I see it.&&I don't blame them, honestly. The rape of nanking is horrible. Until 732 was horrible. All their shit was horrible. Cultures of hierarchial insecurity always are the harshest in their violence and oppression.&&Right! Method filming.&&If I am permitted a poor analogy, I think it's in the same vein as a taxi driver or just a lifelong seasoned driver being likely to fail a driving test if put to the task. You get used to all sorts of maneuvers and things real life throws in your way and stray away from the 'curriculum'.&&Expert writers can make stylistic choices that ignore the rules of grammar/writing that still make sense. The average person cannot.&&I'm sure if the professional writer had the template response and knew the elements the course grading system required they'd smash it. It might not be the teacher's fault, just a fucked grading system. &&The same rules apply to art and architecture-- you need a solid grasp of what needs to be there and why, before you can make an informed decision to change or remove it. Otherwise you're cargo culting someone else's stylistic decisions without any understanding of why they made those decisions in the first place.

Case in point, any DIY project where a guy says ""I want a room that looks like this other room I saw"", knocks out 3 supporting walls, and doesn't get why his house just collapsed.&&Did it respond to the prompt? Was it even one of Orwell's better essays? Just because he's a celebrated author doesn't mean everything he ever wrote will make an English professor weak-kneed. 

In my opinion this story makes Crichton look like an annoyingly egotistical young kid who thinks the only reason he's getting bad grades is because the professor is out to get him. &&Because the guidelines are used to make you learn or practice something you otherwise might not want to.

If I ask you to write a one page love story written from first person, and you write me a 20 page fantasy murder mystery. No matter how good your writing is, you aren't getting a good grade. &&I can be done the other way, too. And some movies have done it effectively. But Schindler's List is definitely a movie about survival, whereas the Holocaust is a story of *not* surviving.

You can look at almost any major event in the film, and it is about one happy ending after another. An example that immediately comes to mind is the scene of the women being led into what they assume was a gas chamber, and just as they start screaming in horror, water comes flowing out of the shower heads instead of gas. Happy ending to the moment. Sure, the build-up is tense and horrific, but the audience is left off the hook in the end.

The reason I personally don't believe this argument holds water is because there *are* minor scenes sprinkled throughout that showcase the depravity of this historical event. I think the movie does do enough to show that. Anyway, it is an interesting and definitely legitimate argument, though.&&I'm not remembering that, I don't think I wrote that one man.&&###**>!UUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<**&&Most will claim that all work done as coursework by students remains IP of the University.&&Rules are made for the lowest common denominator&&Anyone deeply set in a religious belief so it controls and hold back their lives from being better in general.&&I feel like when you are as sexually repressed as Hasidic Jews are it wouldn‚Äôt be out of the ordinary&&I haven't seen it. What happens in this infamous shower scene? &&Interestingly, I was watching a BBC documentary on Auschwitz recently, and in there a survivor described a ~~single~~ similar incident that actually happened to her.&&... Fuck man, I'm only 26! I'm not old!

But I really feel old right now. :(&&We read and I showed part of ""The Devil's Arithmatic"" for my high school class when they studied the holocaust. My principal approved it, but only if I skipped some scenes with nudity. 

I also had to fight administration to let my class read a novel about teen pregnancy due to curse words. These were kids graduating or going to college in the next year! We also had to use an abridged version of Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" due to district policy.

Hmm. Now I remember why I finally stopped teaching high school after 13 years. Loved the kids. Loved the materials. Hated administration and district and state policies that stifled learning :(&&""You made out during 'Schindlers List' ?""&&This, so much. Film, especially well-made film, is on par with literature for me at least. They're both forms of expression, they're both ways of telling a story.&&> It's why you don't let a 5 y.o. watch ""Hereditary"". A young brain is still learning to process the world, you don't want to overwhelm it in a single sitting.

Unless you want them to become a worthy vessel for King Paimon, in which case it's recommended practice.&&parental permission slips always meant the movie was rated ""R"" or had subject matter in it that may cause a parent freak-out, aka they were covering their asses&&That must be hard to teach film with that rule. All the best films are rated R.&&My COLLEGE film teacher only showed two R rated films (one was Millers Crossing so it barely counts) because he said people always complained.  &&Wait, you watched The Elephant Man in school?&&[deleted]&&I remember watching Requiem for a Dream with my pothead friends in high school. Immediately after it was over, I decided not to smoke for a while and drove around for a long time instead of going home in order to get my shit together. I remember calling my mom from a Steak 'N' Shake parking lot and asking her to never try diet pills and not really explaining why. She probably thought I was stoned. &&My dad got that for my sister and I when we were maybe 8 or 9 years old. I think he just saw that it was about a brother and sister and thought that we would like watching it together since we were pretty into anime at the time.

Needless to say, the trauma was real. We laugh about it now but I don't think either of us have watched it again.&&Grave of the fireflies is the saddest film ive ever watched. I know that it can be timing (related life events can impact) but i still can not imagine a time in my life when it would have been less gut wrenching.&&That's what's awesome about Schindler's story. Dude was an enthusiastic Nazi, party member from way back and he started a factory by convincing Jews to give him cash for fucking pots at incredible markup. He then used the Jews as slave labor. If he had a heart attack in the middle of the war he would have gone down with the same infamy as SS officers. 

Then he just decided at some point that he was gonna be a good guy. Saw some shit he didn't like, didn't want to be a part of and did a complete 180. &&I know. But don't you do this to me&&Yes, he bankrupted himself saving as many lives as he could, and after the war all of his business ventures failed, to the point where he ended up having to be financially supported by the very Jews he saved. But he was also named one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an honor given by the state of Israel for people who helped the Jews during the Holocaust, which has only ever been given to around 25,000 people, and he is the only member of the Nazi Party to be buried on Mount Zion.&&This will probably sound horrible but doing it now feels so intangible, I think that is a lot of the problem. If we had to go live in a village without water people would probably be more likely to empathize. &&Absolutely! I don't mean to downplay what he did. I just mean that he doesn't start out as some unrelatable boy scout who is fun to watch but impossible to live up to. &&You retract that bit about my cunt fucking kids.&&I have to remind myself that he's not a cunt. He's not a cunt now, and he has never been a cunt. &&He did, but then he used that flashy thing afterwards so no one would remember. &&It doesn't even make you think about race, it hits you over the head repeatedly and does the thinking for you. Such a trash movie and a sorry attempt at being ""deep"".&&I like your analogy, you changed my mind.&&A family friend who worked at a law firm for decades failed passing the Bar twice because he answered more along the lines about how the law is actually practiced instead of how it ought to be.&&A published essay from that era is likely to have gone through professional copy editing and many revisions based on a style guide. In college writing a lot of the grade is from near-zero technical errors and following a style guide not for whether or not the professor enjoyed your story. An acclaimed professional work should get an A.&&This very poster shows one moment where the audience is not let off the hook. Spoilers! The little girl in red ending up in a mass grave.&&[deleted]&&It's built up as the group is getting sent to the gas chamber to be executed, complete with the Nazis locking the door so no one can get out. Then it's literally just a regular shower, so the group survives. It plays off the horrible things people know about the death camps. &&Its towards the end of the film. Schindler has bought as many Jews from Goeth as possible and is moving them to the work camp in Czechoslovakia I think to ride out the end of the war. However, the train with the women and children doesn't arrive with the men, and Oskar finds out it was sent to Auschwitz.

Cue Oskar bargaining with the commandant of Auschwitz to get them sent back to him, and a tense sequence where you're not sure if he's going to arrive in time to fix the fuck up before they're gassed on arrival. &&Hail Paimon!&&HAIL KING PAIMON!&&Only if that 5-year old is a male, of course. &&It definitely requires some creativity. Over the last couple years I‚Äôve come up with a list of movies to show that are not rated R. But man was that first year hard figuring out what to show &&lol my students complain when I show them Citizen Kane but I‚Äôm still going to show it. Not every student will like every movie, and the ones who are vocal about not liking it are often in the minority.&&Yeah, I think it was the first sort of artsy (for the lack of a better word) movie that I saw, it was pretty good. &&Another notable person who saved Jews was Chiune Sugihara, who used his power as a Japanese government official to sneak Jews through Japanese territory with visas.  He also a Righteous Among the Nations by the Jewish community.

They have a movie about him - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBbzFjw5mlI

They also named a street after him in Israel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw0231w87Fk

On the flip side, John Rabe used his position as a Nazi Party member to protect Chinese citizens during the Nanking Occupation and massacre by the Japanese.  The citizens of Nanjing actually helped Rabe financially after the war since the man spent his savings on legal proceedings to be de-Nazified.

They also have a film about him as well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eic4y6DI5Ec&&I think you're right, we are comparing ourselves to someone who lived surrounded by the holocaust, when it's more accurate to compare ourselves to Americans in that time who also heard of what was happening to Jews just like we hear about what happens in Africa. It's not an exact comparison but it's closer than comparing us to Schindler &&You're an inanimate object.&& I retract that bit about your cunt fucking kids.&&You retract that! &&Get out with this measured and reasonable response. We don't like your kind around here.&&There's also the whole thing with [Liesek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PbBvI5YPaM).&&2001: A Space Odyssey, rated G!&&I mean, I guess if you have to watch a David Lynch movie in elementary school, that would be the one, I just find it baffling. &&I watched The Elephant Man at age 8 while staying home from school sick with a high fever.   I have never cried more during a movie in my entire life.  

That film WRECKED me.  I was sobbing hard during certain parts and cry things out loud like ""Why is everyone so mean to him?"" and  stuff like that.  It shook my naive middle-class milk 'n cookies kid worldview to the core and sent me on a path towards having a very cynical outlook during my teens, especially when I found out that the film was based on a real person.

The Elephant Man is so goddamn heartbreaking.  I've actively avoided it ever since despite going through a massive David Lynch phase.  It's too much for me even as an adult.&&My day just got better reading that dialogue&&Kids these days&&I looked into the comment section, that was a mistake.&&I'd recommend Eraserhead in elementary school.  &&""Nice job Amon!

He‚Äôs a huge draw at this point in his career. &&> watching multiple times 

exactly&&No kidding. 1st time for the actual movie and then for the score.&&Did you watch all the other 1983 Wonder Woman sequels just once then?&&As an Australian, I agree! &&Best news I've heard all year. And I got a job this year&&Didn‚Äôt JunkieXL write that part?&&yea i agree. i found the BvS movie very boring and dull, but that piece of music was a powerhouse. Can't wait to hear a full WW score from him.&&Am I the only one who doesn't like that theme?&&Whoa there. It's one of the better themes in the past 5 years, but I wouldn't go THAT FAR.&&I hate to break it to you but...that‚Äôs definitely *not* Hans Zimmer lol&&Junkie XL?&&This is not high enough...&&Who cares? Hans Zimmer is back&&Isn‚Äôt he doing Dark Phoenix too?&&I also thought I was done with superheroe movies when I saw Batman v Superman yet here I am now&&Yeah, but how much will he actually score and how much will his protegee's do. &&But this is a period piece. &&[deleted]&&I think this one isn‚Äôt about Diana protecting humanity like the first one, it‚Äôs probably more likely dealing with her more personal problems with the gods&&I guess they retconned that idea. Gal had mentioned in one of her pressers.

*‚ÄúNone of us knew exactly, exactly, the back story of Wonder Woman,"" Gadot said. ""And once they decided to shoot the solo movie for Wonder Woman and we started to dig in to understand the core of this character, we realized that, actually, there is no way that Wonder Woman would ever give up on mankind.""*&&He's a company that has a lot of people working for him to pump out scores. I've read that he'll come up with a basic theme and interns end up composing every thing else. It's just a big machine. I'm not a hater, but I don't know why he has fans, I think 'his' scores are fairly forgettable, and there's a reason why he can score so many movies in a year... he has 13 fucking credits for 2011. &&Wonder Woman already has an established sound and theme, and after how Elfman destroyed all musical continuity for Batman and Superman with Justice League, it would be nice to see at least one character keep a consistent theme throughout. Gregson-Williams was an apprentice of Zimmer and did a faithful job extending his work from BvS, but I can‚Äôt imagine an outside composer would do the same. &&I know this is random but I often go to sleep listening to the 2049 score. Lulls me into a deep and dreamless slumber. &&This isn't even a Zimmer thing, it's a Denis Villeneuve thing. See: Sicario&&He said unless he really liked what the script was offering.&&I get the feeling he announced that, just so Zack Snyder would stop calling him up tbh&&Using the same four chords, not bothering to write melodies or have an original musical idea, and having an army of interns to help ""orchestrate"" seems to be the winning formula.&&Va va va
Imma get on it&&Blade Runner 2049 didn't really have large string sections, did it? Also, Carpenter would be a risky choice, since he never scored a big budget film before.&&Both are great. There is no need to fight over this&&this isn't even an opinion.  That's like saying ""I think this Michelin star restaurant is maybe better than Applebee's.""&&Bernard Hermann > John Williams&&Very brave stating an opinion like that.&&Giacchino has been doing a lot of unremarkable scores recently too. I‚Äôm still a big fan, but I think he‚Äôs just trying to do too many films. &&but i want to hear moar ""bwaaaaahhhh""!

Fucking one-trick pony...&&Saw him in concert last year in Philly.......can't describe how epic it was hearing that sound reverberating throughout the Wells Fargo Center.&&In my head that sounds like the music from the warthog run&&Seriously the best theme in a loooong ass time&&Drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhrrrrrrrrr&&Bwahhhhhhhh&&The best part of BvS.&&>Is THE best thing to come out of the DC films

This scene still gives me goosebumps purely because of the music.&&I only think of the sopranos when I hear this quote now.&&He‚Äôs scoring X-Men: Dark Phoenix as well&&Considering Snyder arguably got Zimmer‚Äôs best work out of him with Man of Steel, I don‚Äôt see how this correlates. For the record I think Man of Steel is good, it‚Äôs just some people don‚Äôt. &&...Which one?&&brah, look who's paying him... snyder f00&&Too bad it was the shittiest of Spidey films.&&His music almost saved Amazing Spiderman 2&&And X-Men&&Yeah, it's safe to say every well known DC hero (and villain) theme from the last ten years is thanks to Zimmer.&&Now, if only they got writer and directors to match that quality.&&I also went to one of his tours. The London stop. Wonder woman theme with Tina was absolutely the highlight of the show for me. That and ,video killed the radio star. &&Same here! The whole superhero portion already blew me away and then came the WW theme... Damn was it fantastic! &&[Ohh](https://media.giphy.com/media/YHYmMLkOmqoo/giphy.gif)&&Maybe like a certain film he scored last year. &&Give me a drive meets super hero soundtrack and I‚Äôm in. &&YOUVE BEEN DOWN TOO LONG IN THE MIDNIGHT SEA&&The score is extremely clever in how it ties together themes and how it builds to the Wonder Woman theme so it's not jarring within the time period, and also so it fits into the rest of the score. He was essentially forced to build a soundtrack around a very unconventional theme, and I think he did a wonderful job.&&Check out Dan Golding‚Äôs video essay on YouTube about the score, I had similar sentiments as you until i watched the video and then rewatching Wonder Woman. On mobile so I can‚Äôt link, but even if it doesn‚Äôt change your mind it is really interesting to see how he made the theme evolve &&Incredibly disagree with that. The no man's theme especially the first half with the more calmer theme created for the movie was a work of art.&&I'm probably in the minority, but the most memorable parts of the score for me (Angel on the Wing, the first half of No Man's Land) were the ones that didn't contain Zimmer's Wonder Woman theme. The synthesized ass-kicking theme is great and catchy, but it's Rupert's contributions that really embody Wonder Woman's heroism and sense of justice. In my opinion, of course. &&Annnndddddd hes not Hans Zimmer. Lets be honest with ourselves for a second!&&Ah well so much for paying attention to continuity of DC films I guess.

Music has always been at the forefront of DC. And Zimmer scored MoS and BvS, the essential movies leading to WW intro. No wonder the tone lies at the heart of what has been done before. That's what makes it amazing. And in no way Rupert's score was generic. No Man's Land is amazing without a question but the music where Diana is heartbroken when he village was bombed and the tiny piece when Diana lifts a tank and has to choose whether to kill Doctor Poison really stand out. &&His scoring completely made Interstellar.&&Same. I was initially on the fence about it, but Hans Zimmer doing the soundtrack is a guaranteed way to put my ass in a movie theater seat. Same with movies that have soundtracks by the late Basil Poledouris.&&the only reason to watch ‚Äòthe holiday‚Äô&&There are dozens of us.

I saw Constantine 12 times in theatre because the movie was cool and soundtrack was fucking awesome &&We seriously need to bomb Canberra, or at least appoint a school teacher to stop the kids from fighting&&Hans Zimmer for PM?&&Congrats :) &&Tina Guo wrote that part&&[deleted]&&Whoosh!&&No. It‚Äôs fairly well-known that Zimmer writes very little of the music credited to him. 

All composers lean on orchestrators to write additional music and flesh out cues, but Zimmer is legendary for it. &&You can‚Äôt flim flam a Zimmer zam. &&Yes&&Depends. How much do you like hearing Thin Red Line and Dark Knight Trilogy reprises outside of the original context?&&His score was great though.&&That would be interesting. I guess part of me was hoping she would go back and help recover from Steppenwolf goin 'Born to be Wild' on her people and then something going down. It just seems odd that her next standalone film will also be set in the past. I'm not complaining, just seemed like an odd choice to me&&Where the hell was she during World War 2 then? She didn‚Äôt think Hitler was Ares resurrected?&&Right? I feel that most film scores do little for the scenes they're connected to, except as the most basic audio cue of 'this is exciting, this is sad.' Even the leitmotif seems to be vanishing, which is funny because the last movie with a theme I could honestly remember without prompting is Pirates...which is Hans Zimmer.&&Yeah but he‚Äôs also created incredible scores just by himself in the 90s and later. &&Yeah but it's Hans Zimmer&&Not to mention its sort of blade runners *thing*&&I think it was probably more that he was weirded out by the fact that he had to reinvent Batman *again*. He probably didn‚Äôt expect the Superman sequel turning into a Batman movie.&&Brutal! But I think you have a point.&&That's because 2049 was composed by Benjamin Walfisch, with only small advice given by Zimmer.&&Now hold up. I wouldn't compare Zimmer to Applebees. He's still fucking fantastic. It's just Zimmer is an A, and Williams is an A+. I think given more time Zimmer could even surpass Williams.&&Ennio Morricone > Bernard Herman&&Listen to Interstellar or literally anything he composed prior to Inception. There‚Äôs no use of the large horn section in the way you‚Äôre describing here. &&His Coachella stuff is awesome also. Always thought Coachella was all edm, but having him do that in concert there was pretty cool. I love movie soundtracks and scores, so that was a great surprise&&I saw him on tour last year as well. Dying for another north American tour to be announced... &&I was sitting third row, centre at his show in Toronto.

I believe that was what they were going for.&&Hisaishi is one of the greatest film composers of the past 20-30 years.

Hans Zimmer created a company that takes advantage of interns, slaps his name on scores that were shat out by a team who barely get any credit, and can't write a good fucking melody. 

They are nothing alike.&&You and the rest of Canada, friendo&&Wonder Woman has to reach the kill screen in Missile Command in order to get the code to a Japanese Orbital Missile launcher but in order for her to do that she has to listen to Tom Sawyer while playing the game and why does this sound familiar?&&

I would pay for this!
&&[Yes indeed](https://youtu.be/9ffoTMBlAOA) &&Between Zimmer, Daft Punk and Deadmau5, they probably have synths worth over $100M&&Between Zimmer, Daft Punk and Deadmau5, they probably have synths worth over $100M&&And if he could write a melody or something, like he did in his 80's movie scores, that would be a nice back to roots...&&Well there goes that reasoning. &&I mean Fox superhero movies have been more hit than miss since 2011. &&There's clunkers in there for sure, but the Fox X-Men movies at their best have been not just on par, but the cream of the crop when it comes to comic book films.&&That theme is beyond satisfying. &&Man of Steel is definitely not his best work. I'd say either TDK, Interstellar or Kung Fu Panda would take that cake. &&‚ÄúJourney to the Line‚Äù fight me&&In some parallel universe those MoS themes hit like a motherfucker and everyone adores them. I hope they can figure out a way to keep using em. 

I think they should do a hybrid ; bring back the Williams stuff ( to say ""This is *Superman*, remember?"" ) ; augment it with Zimmers - 'The Planet Krypton' leading into 'Flight' or somesuch. A composer could easily do this, it's ( almost ) all in C Major. ; p I've mixed elements of the two scores in my low-bitrate Audacity mixes and it works wonderfully and naturally.&&Man of Steel is far, far, far away the best DC universe movie to be released since the Nolan films.  It is extremely flawed and not a great movie but it looks like the Godfather compared to Wonder Woman and Batman v Superman and all the other trash to roll out of that studio.&&I did kinda dig the Electro song, to be honest&&> Too bad it was the shittiest of Spidey films.

I love the Amazing Spider-man films. For me, the worst is still Spider-man 3. &&He scored the Amazing Spiderman? Huh TIL&&I have no plans to rewatch ASM2 but I listen to the soundtrack all the time.&&I guess Danny Elfman is oldskool now&&The boss baby?&&?&&OH WHATS BECOMING OF MEEE!&&I agree.  Plus it gave me chills and that‚Äôs always good.&&It's only the best movie made with one of the best scores ever&&Except Tina doesn't write, Zimmer had the basic idea and she sampled it out for him.&&See I immediately thought of Kashmir when I first heard it in 2016, glad I'm not the only one&&Wasn't Junkie XL one of the more prominent ones along with Wallfisch?

Always felt bad for the guy who composed every track bar one for Modern Warfare 2 that was credited for Zimmer. Can't even remember the guy's name. :(&&""I must defeat Ares, he's at it again!""

*Ares appears out of nowhere*


""Oh no sister, I didn't do this one. Humans are just fucked.""&&BvS is basically retconned when it comes to Wonder Woman&&You need to watch movies with better composers then. Also since the comment you're responding to mentions Zimmer's habit of having others do 90% of the work and then slapping his name on it: most of Pirates wasn't Zimmer it was Klaus Badelt who got knocked into obscurity once he left Remote Control Productions to make his own company that can't compete with the soulless fucking machine that is RCP.&&Oh I'm not questioning his ability. Just pointing out he's more an industry than an actual composer these days. &&Nah Applebee‚Äôs is perfect. Dude can‚Äôt read music and doesn‚Äôt actual place any songs into the film. It‚Äôs the difference between a chef and a cook.&&Zimmer surpassing Williams? There's more chance of winning the lottery than that happening.&&I can't argue with that&&Him playing The Dark Knight medley during 2016 Coachella was one of the best live performances of a soundtrack.  Too bad there's hardly any good quality videos on it on YouTube &&It‚Äôs weird what happened to Coachella. Used to be Radiohead and animal collective. Now it‚Äôs Beyonc√© and Eminem. &&I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and see him during the last tour in America.  I chickened out and I don‚Äôt know why.  Not really something I typically do and I‚Äôm just not someone who does something out of the blue.  I regret it.  I regularly listen to his stuff and absolutely love it.  If he announces another tour, I really want to go.  Any advice for going to one of his events?  &&I meant DCEU&&That first bit sounds like a homage to fanfare to the common man, which is a cool reference. &&I will get butchered for this. But I don't see how at this day and age, with the amazing soundtracks in existence, why people think this superman theme is special.

Zimmer's theme for man of steel is 1000x better than John's while still embracing his old theme. &&people are assholes&&Or the Jay Z&&Mia Khalifa is the Mia Khalifa of film whores&&No. It‚Äôs because he keeps coming back every time he says he‚Äôs done with a particular franchise.&&He took inspiration off the old Non DCEU movie scores. Tim button Batman and Christopher Reeves Superman come to mind and both had refrains calling back to them. Unfortunately,it didn't work at all. Zimmer had established new iconic themes that were entirely absent and the emotional moments fall flat without Zimmer's driving score.&&Pretty sure it was VERY last minute. He didn‚Äôt have much time or creative freedoms. &&I remember reading he had to compose the score using storyboards because the movie was done filming in time.&&Miyazaki ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done‚Äù 
God ‚Äúnah‚Äù &&\*cough\* chuck \*cough\* Shazam&&I‚Äôve really been enjoying a binge of Chuck on Amazon recently, that episode is awesome. &&So what you're saying is that we'll get a Shazam cameo?&&He probably didn't just want to stay attached to a possible sinking ship after seeing the reception to Batman v Superman. I don't think he was ever done with superhero movies altogether. &&> Well there goes that reasoning.

There are a lot of good-to-great X-men films - Logan, The Wolverine, First Class, X-men, X2, Days of Future Past and both Deadpool films.&&Or maybe he though dark Phoenix was good and wanted to do the score? 

Oh nevermind, I am on /movies. No one can make a good x men movie accept for marvel /s&&I wouldn‚Äôt knock it yet, Apocalypse was a misstep but every other Singer X Men was good.&&Rekt.&&Its so crazy how Fox's X-Men got thrown in with Amazing Spider-Man and Fantastic Four as just this dud of a series when it's not only generally good, but has actually shown noticeable improvement over the past decade. Like I distinctly remember in 2011 we were all talking about how much we were looking forward to what the new X-Men movies were going to be like, and they've been either good or amazing (or Apocalypse).

I think what it comes down to is that we don't really care if a series is good anymore unless its part of a universe thats consistent and building to something, and that doesn't really apply to X-Men. But yeah, most of the movies are good.&&Xmen Dark Phoenix has Sophie turner, one of the worst actresses in recent memory as a lead, that‚Äôs enough to let you know the movie will be garbage&&They've had far more hits than the DCEU for sure. &&I mean, Inception‚Äôs pretty fantastic as well. 

And Prince of Egypt. 

And Rush. 

God, there‚Äôs so many. &&The Lion King.&&Inception and Pirates‚Äô scores were both excellent.&&[deleted]&&""Po Learns the Truth"" from Kung Fu Panda 2 is one of his best tracks in my opinion. And as others mentioned, Lion King is fantastic.&&Inception as well. &&Man of Steels score is way better than TDK‚Äôs score imo.&&Gladiator for me. &&Absolutely not. Man of Steel is one of his worst by a mile. His very best work would be tied between Prince of Egypt and Thin Red Line. Both are nuanced scores that really pushed Zimmer's rhythmic style of composing to his limits. Emotional, dynamic, everything that is the best about Zimmer. Not complex - Zimmer doesn't do complex, not in the way Williams or Shore does - but they showcase the strengths of Zimmer's music. 

Man of Steel is repetitive, dull, and outright forgettable. &&You guys forget that Zimmer was making music before 2010? Add in The Thin Red Line, The Lion King, Gladiator and a personal favourite of mine is Mission impossible 2.&&I said arguably! His MoS score is for sure better than TDK‚Äôs imo, but I might give you Interstellar. He‚Äôs got a couple dope individual tracks for the Panda movies (Arrival of Kai) but I don‚Äôt remember it being collectively great.&&The Last Samurai is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. I get emotional just listening to ‚ÄòA Way Of Life‚Äô.&&GLADIATOR&&Interstellar, man. What a score. &&Why? Have you listened to his man of steel score? It's absolutely phenomenal. Unbelievably powerful, emotional, and inspired work. The best superhero movie score out there as far as I am concerned. I know people typically think TDK is a better movie, but all I can really remember from the score was those two chords he always plays whenever batman does some thing cool or at the end of the films. His batman stuff was okay but I actually prefer Elfman's theme. In general I like batman music to be more operatic. Honestly I can't help but speculate that people are associating their opinions on the movie itself with the score. Seriously, it's REALLY freaking good&&I'll fight beside you&&If you're a fan of bagpipes, you should check out the [Royal Scots Dragoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFReeDI6WY) cover. &&Crimson Tide as well. One of the first good scores entirely composed of electronic techno themes.&&As someone who thinks Man of Steel is not very good, the ""Flight"" theme and scene are both fantastic. Easily the best piece of music in the entire franchise and probably the best moment in it to boot.&&I remember DC put out this maybe 5 minute short for supermans 75th anniversary that had both the donner and snyder themes and it blended very well.

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebXB0lBoaQ0) is the video&&They did. If you watch ""Justice League"" Danny Elfman crafted both his original Batman theme from the '90s and Williams' Superman theme. It's not super subtle but you can definitely hear it if your ears are sharp. The Superman theme doesn't work as well, but he pulls off the Batman call backs for sure. &&As much as that movie sucked, I thought Hanz Zimmer's score for it was fantastic.&&So you like the itsy bitsy spider huh?&&Now dig on *this*&&I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.&&Spider-Man 3 is honestly pretty good. They could have done without the venom plot, but it doesn't drag down the good parts of the movie Imo&&You're trash, u/CH_GOROG&&I loved the first one. It was my favorite Spiderman movie until Homecoming. The second one I still liked, but it definitely had too much going on&&I‚Äôd say ASM2 is the worst, with 3 not far behind it. The first Amazing was actually really good in my opinion. But I love Spider-Man so I could be biased. &&I recently rewatched the Amazing Spider-man Movies, and needless to say that was a bit of a chore.  But, what they got right in my opinion was Gwen as a character, and how Spiderman is supposed to fight.  They definitely overspent to make his Fights some of the coolest moments in the film, and I hope that can be translated to the MCU one day.  His fight with Electro and Goblin are two that stuck out the most to me.

I also I think they handled the ""Death of Gwen Stacy"" Well.  Making the Bridge where she was supposed to die Peter's happiest moment with her was a nice touch, effective replacing Comic Peter's Saddest moment with her.  Then that noise when she hits the ground is still haunting to me, even after having watched that movie 4 years ago and recently.  The Web Hand bit was cheesy, so I'm not giving Sony too many props here, but I only just realized that her time of Death was 1:21, which was a reference to the issue of Amazing Spiderman she died in.  I thought that was also well done.&&Yeah, his JL score was pretty shitty&&Ahem, you mean Academy Award¬Æ ~~winner~~ nominee The Boss Baby?&&b l a d e  r u n n e r  2 0 4 7&&And Lorne Balfe, John Powell, Steve Jablonski, Pinar Toprak... The list goes on forever. 

Again, all composers rely on others to help them expand on the initial short score they write, but Zimmer is on another level. &&[Link for the curious.](https://youtu.be/0eOGrTWvTmA)&&his entire concert is up on Netflix FYI&&Are you hesitant about going to concerts or something? Just curious.

Actually, when I went, I went all by myself! I was interning halfway across the country from where I live, and I bussed 4 hours to see the concert. So I didn't know anyone. That was weird but I'm so glad I went!

I would definitely say get the best seats you can get. I paid about 100 for a seat in the first level and it was worth it. If the floor seating hadn't been sold out I would've sat there. 

Minimize the time you spend recording the concert and really just soak it all in, in the moment. Someone else will upload it on YouTube, anyway.

I really hope he announces another tour.

Also, side note, I recommend going to Ramin Djawadi' s game of thrones concert. Even if you may not watch game of thrones... The music is great and he's my next favorite composer after Hans Zimmer. I went to the game of thrones concert last year and will be going again, that's how good it was! &&I just listened to the Man of Steel OST and I can't grasp the musical theme. What's his signature? I could not remember it even though I saw Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. It's not an error they hired Elfman to do the score for Justice League and he used both Batman and Superman old themes.

Please, compare this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgPZ-iqHQRQ and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jioG6eFBiew

The only theme they got right was Wonder Woman's.

I wish they hired the dude who did the Kick Ass score. That's the way to go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj6Tmm90tOE&&Or the Michael Jordan &&I mean if there's one thing that I can't criticize DC about is that their hero's have great and (most importantly) recognizable themes. Batman's was creepy as hell, Superman's flight and zod themes were incredible, and Wonder Woman's was probably the most iconic of the bunch. I think an Elfman call back may have worked if it were done better, but as it was it didn't really work. 

Marvel's universe is seriously lacking some incredibly music imo. The avengers one is meh, and I honestly couldn't even tell you if Thor or Ironman have definitive themes between all three movies. I don't think I've disliked any music choices but they're all a bit bland. &&Just to keep it honest, Justice League does feature (albeit briefly and quietly) the beginning of Zimmer's Superman theme with tracked music from Man of Steel during the scene where the team enters Zod's ship, as well as Zimmer's Wonder Woman theme.&&I'm not gonna lie, hearing the old batman theme gave me tingles.&&This next movie will totally be his last!&&You misspelled ""Miyazaki"" on the second one&&Chuck was just an awesome show.&&Which sucks cos Hans' (and Junkie's) score for BvS is great, I still listen to it every once in a while. Whereas the JL score couldn't be more generic (except when they brought back the MoS theme for a bit)

Edit: forgot Junkie's co-composer woops!&&Pretty sure Zimmer's reputation isn't really at stake at this point.&&Wonder Woman 1984 must have an amazing script  [https://www.inverse.com/article/29179-hans-zimmer-quit-superhero-scores-batman-masterclass](https://www.inverse.com/article/29179-hans-zimmer-quit-superhero-scores-batman-masterclass)&&Reddit is the only place I know of who think that somehow the DC movies are better than the X-Men movies.  

I mean, are you serious? Even the worst of the X-Men movies is on par or better than the best of the DC movies. &&> Apocalypse 

as horrible as Apocalypse was, how is it not superior to Batman v Superman or Justice League? Because....you know...it is?&&X Men films have been getting increasingly good, with the only exception being Apocalypse (which was bad because it tried too hard at being a generic Marvel film).

I really like where the series has gone, concentrating on more personal story archs and carving out a niche to separate themselves from the main Marvel films which haven't changed or advanced at all really.&&Logan was fucking incredible &&She'll be in 5 minutes of the movie and the rest will be CGI action scenes and eagle screams with fiery explosion sounds.&&Just curious but why do you say Sophie Turner is a bad actress ? I've only ever seen her in GoT and she's alright in the role.&&Nah she's great. &&Sherlock Holmes&&[deleted]&&Can't forget Dunkirk and Interstellar.&&To me, it's Inception. That takes the cake completely&&Best decision ever was seeing his tour live last year. The first half of the show was his greatest hits from random movies that really showed his range. The second half was mainly superhero movies and his Nolan stuff and it turned into the best concert experience of my life. Had to go because I have a feeling it's never going to happen again.&&Pirates&&[deleted]&&This is the answer.&&My bad, totally forgot about that. &&You're the only other person that's mentioned Gladiator.  What the hell is going on here?  &&The problem with the KFP scores are hat I‚Äôm pretty sure John Powell wrote most of the themes in the first movie. &&Fuckin lies.&&Arguably as immersive as Empire Strikes Back, and in a better way.  &&Imma level witchu chief, in what world is the MoS score better TDK, and I like MoS btw&&Brother!&&Oh, it's awesome. And the thing is : if you think of the Zimmer themes as a suite they often touch on territory John Williams never went to. He went for classical whimsy, etc : but there's nothing quite as 'driving' - ready for business, for action - as that Flight theme. It's got a great sense of locomotion. Same with the 'Clark' theme on piano ; it gets that country-folk side of the character. 

That's why I think the two scores would work so damn well together ; they can compliment each other. You can hear in [this](https://youtu.be/ats1VhmOESQ?t=62) how HZ really wanted to evoke [The Planet Krypton](https://youtu.be/C-vz4Gdtrvc?t=23) ; and you could blend them, have them zip in and out of each other or texture each other. &&I agree. 



But even as a huge Zimmer fan, would have liked to see  James Horner's score continue from the first one. &&The score was fine, the score over *that* film was fucking weird and out of place.  Never before or since have I had that thought about the fucking score of a film but sure as shit I sat there in theatres wondering what the actual fuck was going on.&&I personally lose myself when listening to ""Rooftop Kiss"", from when Peter and Gwen are... kissing on the rooftop.

&&The Venom plot is basically the entire movie. &&Homecoming is your favorite Spiderman movie?

No offense or anything. I find it to be the least interesting one easily. There was hardly any decent action and the plot just seemed like it didn't affect much, you know? &&Okay. I gotcha, and respect your opinion on the matter. &&That death scene was emotionally charged, visually stunning, and haunting. I thought the web hand was a really nice touch.

That scene is probably among the best death scenes ever. The whole movie was great for me, but that was the peak. &&For all my problems with TASM2 (and I really do think it's terrible), the choreography as Spidey and Goblin fight in the clocktower is superb. Fast-paced, acrobatic, and hectic, but never so chaotic that you can't follow the action. Best Spidey fight since the clocktower/train scene in Spider-man 2.&&I feel really shitty about having this thought, but I also thought the JL score was a crazy let down in comparison to DE's earlier scores and in comparison with HZ.&&Just nominated, which is bad enough but at least it didn't win.&&Boy, you deserve a silent voice for pointing that out

The MCU has been trying with the Avengers theme which I appreciate but it IS rather generic. It serves it's function I suppose, but wouldn't give me goosebumps outside the movie. Interestingly enough, Xmen movies and the original Spiderman trilogy (under Elfman no less) both had very strong musical themes. Odd the MCU directors don't care for them.&&Black Panther has the iconic themes of the bunch. When they played that talking drum and showed W A K A N D A I died in IW&&>The avengers one is meh

Never have I disagreed more with a comment on Reddit. Silvestri's Avengers theme is, IMHO, [iconic ](https://youtu.be/ez-imDgiD4E?t=1m45s)on a John Williams' level.

>and I honestly couldn't even tell you if Thor or Ironman have definitive themes between all three movies

Iron Man actually had an [amazing theme ](https://youtu.be/6YEm6lRLzmU?t=45s)by Ramin Djawadi of Game of Throne fame, and Thor actually had a [really rousing and solid theme ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBuIbjIvoko)as well by Patrick Doyle.

The problem is every subsequent movie changed directors and composers and made the decisions NOT to retain or reuse any elements of these themes, which is why they never become associated properly with the characters and we don't remember them as well.&&While most Marvel films do have pretty generic music there are several where the music is absolutely awesome. Black Panther, the latest Thor, and Civil War have some great tunes plus I think the Infinity War score is easily one of the best scores in years. After listening to it a few times I think it is almost Lord of the Rings levels of good. &&I think the first Ironman film had a great score (was a great film overall). Winter Soldier theme was also really good. 

Apart from those, I don't really remember any other memorable scores from MCU.&&I agree with everything you said except for the avengers theme being meh. That theme is becoming the most iconic one to me. It helps that they play as the title sequence for each avengers movie too&&Yes, true enough. Unfortunately he really doesn't take it far enough. My favorite example is the botched emotional core of the movie. When Superman is resurrected and goes to his home in Kansas where he questions his role in the world. This is THE most important arc of the franchise at this point. Literally 3 movies of him deciding to become hope for the world in spite of it all. This is where the quiet piano music used in Man of steel and its [trailers](https://youtu.be/T6DJcgm3wNY) would really pay off. Whatever Elfman wrote ([think it's this one](https://youtu.be/7QtbCmj71B0)) is so unremarkable the scene falls entirely flat. The DCEU is a bigger mess than ever and missteps like this just FUCK the little redeeming moments. &&I‚Äôll believe that when he‚Äôs dead and even then, I give it three years before he comes back to life saying he‚Äôs got an idea for a new movie.&&Took me a second. &&The BvS score is a part of why I actually kinda like that film. It's also not nearly as terrible as everyone made it out to be imo. &&Danny Elfman had an extremely inflated notion about the popularity of his Batman theme.&&Is there MoS score in JL? Which song ?&&I love the Man of Steel soundtrack tbh&&I was thinking more like that he doesn't want to waste his talent on bad/mediocre films. &&I was never particularly bored when watching the X-Men movies. At their worst, they were still fun to riff on. 

I fell asleep during BvS. &&Actually false. &&Ehhhh i would at least say origins is still noticably worse. Like, I hate almost all the DCEU movies (and while i like WW, i dont like it nearly as much as reddit seems to) but im not so mean as to say its xmen origins bad. They didnt give batman teleportation and laser eyes.

Edit: i wanna be clear im comparing 1/10 movies to eachother. Im not complimenting th4 DCEU movies so muvh as I am insulting xmen origins. Im not building even a fragment of a pedastal so much as I am digging a hole.&&Well for one thing everyone in BvS and JL could at least act. The main cast of Apocalypse have the acting chops of Disney channel tv show kids.

Apocalypse was just fucking garbage tbh, Sophie turners acting out a tear in my eye. JL was fun and the ultimate cut of BvS was good&&I finally rewatched Apocalypse along with the Kinda Funny XCU in Review, and it was so much better than I first remembered. I mean, still not super great, but without the high expectations it wasn't that bad of a film.&&One can only hope&&EDIT: Fucking reddit just ate my edit. Basic summary: Games of Thrones post Season 3 has had increasingly shitty writing and Apocalypse had abysmal writing. So it might not be the actors faults.

Because she's not, and she's not been any better in other roles. She's distracting in GoT, as Kit Harrington used to be and to an extent still is and Emilia Clarke have become. Part of it is that as the plot armor unprotected characters have been weeded out and the cliche protagonists have had to lead the show, they've been pushed out of roles that worked for them. Sophie was good at looking like she was a child who had no idea what she was doing because she was a child who had no idea what she was doing. As a political schemer type she's been overwhelmed by other actors in every scene, especially Aiden Gillen. And everyone on team young X-Men (the once introduced in Apocalypse) has just been bad actors acting at their worst.&&Underrated soundtrack&&Would be super cool to see a second one or another f1-oriented movie. There's tons of good rivalries that could be used. Prost v Senna, Schumacher v Hakkinen, Rosenberg v Hamilton, the list goes on &&Its not even a question that its Pirates.&&Uhhhh The Thin Red Line anyone?&&Hans Zimmer didn't do the score for Pirates, at least not entirely. He was asked to do it after Alan Silvestri quit ""due to creative differences"" (classic), but he was busy with scoring The Last Samurai and had promised not to take on any other assignments. Zimmer got Verbinski to hire Klaus Badelt, but Zimmer did end up collaborating with him to write the three primary themes (most notably He's a Pirate). 

The schedule for writing and recording the score was really tight, they had three weeks, so  Ramin Djawadi, James Dooley, Nick Glennie-Smith, Steve Jablonsky, Blake Neely, James McKee Smith, and Geoff Zanell were all hired to help orchestrate the music and write additional cues. Klaus Badelt is the only credit for composing the score on the soundtrack album.

Zimmer obviously had a huge influence on the score and the stand out piece/main theme ""He's a Pirate"" is largely written by him. But the production mess that it was, along with several composers involvement in the orchestration and writing of the score makes it far from Zimmer's best work. It's not even credited to him.&&This is an ongoing theme with a lot of the members of Remote Control Productions. It's Zimmer's name on the company so a lot of people on the internet attribute entire scores to him, even if he didn't compose or wasn't the main/sole composer.

You'll find many scores on youtube attributed to Hans when it was actually another composer. I struggle to find any MW2 soundtrack clips that give credit to Lorne Balf. Iirc even the digital tracks only mentioned Zimmer.

John Powell has some spectacular work on KFP, HTTYD and chicken run (which I've often found being played on radio from classic in the uk). 

This comment isn't meant to discredit Zimmer either, who is without a doubt an incredible composer himself and one of the most notable in recent history.&&Danny Elfman is the only acceptable source of Spider-Music!&&Damn thinking about it now, Spiderman has had Danny Elfman, James Horner, Hans Zimmer, and Michael Giacchino. Not bad. Not bad at all.&&F&&So

good.&&Not really, it's very clearly tacked on by the studio. There's fan edits out there where they take it out and it's way better (albiet a smidge disjointed for obvious reasons)&&Yeah they definitely overspent for that fight choreography.  Maybe that's not all their money went, but it sure looks like it based on the final product. &&It's sort of hard for me to believe that he made it. It's almost aggressively unmemorable and uninspired.&&Oh whoops, I misremembered.&&Maybe, but you don‚Äôt see the cover art for the Batman v. Superman album saying ‚ÄúMusic by Hans Zimmer, Andrew Kawczynski, Steve Mazzaro, Yvonne Moriarty, Carl Rydlund, Ben Wallfisch, and Eric Whitacre‚Äù

Zimmer is a brand and good for him for building it. And his studio has been the launching pad for some great composers. But he‚Äôs not the guy writing nearly any of the notes you‚Äôre hearing on screen. &&do you like it? Yes

Only people that like it go to it.  So therefore you'll fit in. &&Or the Sachin Tendulkar.&&Considering it is only featured in one film, not really.&&Avengers theme not iconic?

https://youtu.be/I7mDue5HOE8 (spoiler clip from IW).... But anyway this is one of the most epic moments other than the first Capt appearance scene in IW.

Outside of avengers definitely the themes of each superhero are lacking&&The best superhero theme from the MCU‚Äôs first phase was for Captain America.  Silvestri gave us a perfect throwback heroic march that was instantly hummable, then reprised it a few times in the first Avengers score... and Henry Jackman promptly ignored it for the sequels in order to replace it with the rhythmic strings and bland long tones that have become his signature of the last five years.  (And the guy only ever had one decent thematic idea in his life, so riffs on a certain three tones are present in his themes for Kingsman, Captain America, Spider-Man in Civil War, and Jumanji 2.  From a melodic standpoint, he‚Äôs one of the worst composers working in Hollywood today.)&&But that's my point they didn't stick with anything. There is no 'ironman theme' because they haven't stuck with anything, it's changed in almost every iteration. Imagine how sick having each hero having a distinct theme would have been in IW. They could have name dropped elements from their themes into their key movie moments. I mean the movie was great nonetheless but as a soundtrack fan it disappoints me that they haven't done more. 

Agree to disagree on John Williams level, the Avengers theme isn't even close to as memorable or as iconic as Jurassic park, Harry Potter, Jaws, Star Wars or Indiana Jones. &&The latest thor was very cool, kind of retrowave but it was made to fit the distinctive style of that movie, I doubt they will continue to use it beyond Ragnarok. What tracks do you like the most from IW? I haven't listened to it by itself. My experience only comes from 2 viewings and it was good but nothing stuck out to me as 'look up later material'. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vetg_e5fJQ I mean come on, LotR is one of, if not the, best soundtracks of all time. &&I never saw the theatrical version but I liked the Ultimate edition so much I initially watched it twice in a row. &&Yeah I was a big fanboy of the film for months after it came out, and the extended cut just solidified that. 

Nowadays, I see it as massive wasted potential, the themes it was going for were really interesting and quite bold for a studio superhero flick (guess like Watchmen is), but Terrio and Snyder were obviously hampered by having to shoehorn  in Doomsday, WW and the JL. 

My friend and I spent ages rewriting it and of course it's way better and WB should've got us to make it! /s&&I'm a DC fanboy and after multiple viewings (and I got passed my fanboying), I think it's garbage. &&He barely used it at all though.  He should have leaned into it much harder.  As is it was just completely generic and forgettable.&&So much fucking this. You know what really pissed me off about the movie. The music. Idk if anyone mentions this. But when they replaced Junkie XL with Danny Elfman, I was hesitant. And then he mentioned that his theme is the only Batman theme that mattered. He used the original Superman March theme, which is awesome, but it doesn't fit this man of steel. ""What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World"" was this Superman's theme. And even now when I hear it I think I can be fucking Superman. None of his music selection fit the film. He even took out the electric cello from the Wonder Woman theme (""Is She With You?""). That was a massive tragedy. The electric cello gave it an edge. And to wrap this all up in a nice little bow...there was no noticable Justice League theme. Nothing for us to hear and think a superteam is coming to save the day. The movie is talked about awfully in terms of story-telling and plot...but the music was just as bad.  Danny Elfman did not fit this era. I respect all he has done, but this  was just a bad call, made worse by the fact that Elfman thinks his theme is the only ""right"" theme. There are reports of the fabled Snyder cut every day...but fuck it. I'd rather hear what Junkie XL had in store in terms of music. &&Elfman‚Äôs Batman scores are some of the finest pieces of film music in existence.

What Elfman had was an extremely limited amount of time to score Justice League after Junkie XL was replaced.  He didn‚Äôt even have footage to work from in a number of cases and had to work from story boards.  Under the circumstances he did fine.&&It was really popular...25 years ago.  

It also wasn't even used very prominently in JL, which was surprising given the pre release hype.  

There's a potentially a really cool musical transition to be made by having the BvS Batman theme lead into Elfman's, but they didn't so that either. &&https://youtu.be/i7Qb0ngjd7Y

It's in this scene which I thought was in the final movie, I haven't seen the movie since it came out so now I'm unsure if it's in there after all!&&Hell yeah, it's equally beautiful and bombastic. ""If You Love These People"" is a great showcase of that.

Also, do you (or anyone else) know the instrument used at the start of 'Look to the Stars' with the dreamy (for lack of a better term) sound to it? I guess it's something heavily edited but I adore that sound&&Same, BvS was probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. &&Other than WW, what's the best DC movie? Man of Steel?&&> Sophie was good at looking like she was a child who had no idea what she was doing because she was a child who had no idea what she was doing. 

I would agree. Really, I haven't seen her in anything else but I guess if that's the only way she can act, then yeah she'd be a pretty bad actress. &&But acting is a skill that can be improved upon. Dave Bautista had years of stage experience prior to playing Drax in Guardians, but once he was cast in that he heavily committed to acting classes, and his work comes through. She's not actively *bad*, and *can* be engaging-- but, sure, she has room to improve.

Turner's only 22. Major league athletes are still given a chance to improve at that age, even though their careers tend to be much shorter.&&Raikkonen vs Emotions&&> Rosenberg

Rosberg. But yeah, Prost vs Senna would be splendid. Also if you haven't seen ""Senna"", go watch it&&Pirates is good but some of it is pretty derivative of the soundtracks for The Rock, and Gladiator, especially.&&Gladiator was Pirates before Pirates was Pirates. &&He captured the tone of the movies so well in the music &&Michael Giacchino's score for Homecoming was great! &&Elfman has made the most memorable Spiderman and Batman themes &&Yes and the the theme for (Burtons) batman.&&The Danny Elfman Spider-Man theme is honestly one of the best themes in cinema history, Makes me tear up every time I hear it, I kinda wish they'd called back to it in Homecoming at some point&&He *is* the greatest superhero of all time&&Oh boy, yeah&&link?  I always wanted to see these fan edits... never saw one.&&The Avengers theme tune is only iconic because it's been shoved down our throats in so many films. I only started being able to hum it from memory after Infinity War. 

Wonder Woman's theme and Flight from the DCEU were instantly recognisable though as soon as I heard them, same with Zimmer's work for the Nolan films.&&Obviously this is just me and everyone hears music differently, but I've always found that the avengers theme is just a far less exciting version of the Brendan Fraser Mummy theme&&The theatrical version made no sense plot wise. It was completely jumbled and at one point I felt as though I must have missed something. The ultimate cut, while rather long, actually let's you follow it consistently. I've never bothered to watch the theatrical cut again. &&Wait so the ultimate cut is even better? From what I gather I am in the minority and actually like BvS but the Ultimate makes it even better!? Gonna hve to check that out&&I didn't feel that Wonder Woman was shoehorned in, she was one of the best parts of the movie. I haven't seen the theatrical cut, though.&&Well, Elfman was given the job at the last minute and didn‚Äôt have enough time to properly create a good soundtrack. &&Absolutely, I would‚Äôve loved to have heard Junkie‚Äôs score for JL. There are rumours that the music in the justice league ps4 theme is from junkie‚Äôs work. It does seem like it could be and could be a taste of what would‚Äôve come. &&Junkie XL composed one of the decade's best scores for Mad Max: Fury Road and it was a goddamn shame he got replaced here.  I'd love to eventually hear what he wrote.&&He did the same shit with *Avengers: Age of Ultron*. He barely referenced the actual Avengers score and never used the response to the theme call. There's a reason they kicked off the credits with Silvestri's original theme from the first movie.&&We have some movies that work on all levels (great music, vfx, writing, direction) and then we have movies that work on some levels. Like BvS was crap but at least the music was cool. Then there's Justice League. A movie that works on no levels , no redeeming quality. Bad writing, bad acting, crap score, garbage vfx, bland action there's just no level at which one would consider Justice League being a good movie.&&You just encapsulated my feelings perfectly, couldn't have said it better myself.

If I recall correctly, the *fantastic* music in the second-half of the Comic Con trailer is the alternate/musically-flipped version of the MoS theme that Junkie XL made to be the Justice League theme.  I continue to re-watch that trailer just to listen to the music.&&Yeah. I always said that the one inarguable thing the DCEU (or Worlds of DC or whatever) movies had over Marvel was their amazing soundtracks. Whatever your feelings on the movies themselves, Hans Zimmer did a great job with Man of Steel and BvS (latter with Junkie XL). Lex Luthor's theme is an absolutely incredible standout and really fits his character.  

I never imagined that Infinity War would have a better score than Justice League but... here we are. Damn shame. I like Danny Elfman's Batman theme and, although it doesn't fit Batfleck, I thought hearing it again would be nice... nope. It's right in the background and doesn't work at all.

If they ever do a Justice League sequel, just give Hans Zimmer whatever paycheck he asks for and let him do his thing. 
&&Most of the reason I like the MoS soundtrack is because of those otherworldly sounds mixed in. It's both kind of eerie and comforting at the same time, I don't know how else to describe it.&&Well she doesn't have range. I was rewatching early Game of Thrones and she was *good* at being young, naive, eventually terrified Sansa. But Season 5 Sansa on? Nope. Once she gets the black outfit it just starts to get weird. Honestly, maybe the writing just got fucked at that point. Maybe she needed stronger direction/scripting.&&Rosenberg must've been my auto correct lol, thanks for reminding me. And yes I've seen Senna, fantastic movie!&&I SAID ELFMAN&&What? I don't remember anything from homecoming. But the original Spiderman films, yes! &&Michael is a menace!&&I honestly still cannot freely recall the avengers theme and hum to it. &&It fixed some of the pacing and internally consistent problems but still failed to address the underlying problems of the movie as a whole in my opinion.&&I remember watching the theatrical cut thinking that the last thing the movie needed was to have a dozen plot points expanded upon, they needed to be removed altogether. 

That movie needed a page one rewrite. &&She definitely was one of the shining lights of the movie, however if it weren't for Doomsday, I don't think Wonder Woman would've been needed. 

I really liked Diana and Bruce's cat-and-mouse game though, if they left her role to that, and first showcased the Wonder Woman side in the solo film, I think that would've been more effective. But that hinges on a pretty different (Doomsday-less) storyline. &&You should really give it another listen! I think it fit in perfectly with the more light-hearted/optimistic tone of the MCU version of Spidey. &&",2018-08-22 16:28:57

It takes more skill, more focus and more effort to make a box I put a pen into.

No one comments on the hand made custom box after they notice the pen.

I once hand carved a really nice mother and child statuette, something that took me at least 40 hours to complete (*a 90 on the 100 scale*) and gave it to my wife on her birthday.  Comparatively speaking, she was more impressed/excited with a pen that took 20 minutes.

She loved the statuette, but the pen.. she talks about and shows it off it all the time to her friends.&&I know I'm at the bottom of the comments section. But I have to say this is the coolest shit I've ever seen. I love pens, I love movies, I love Stephen King, I love when good books make good movies... This is a fucking winner. Good deal and be proud. &&""Get busy living, or get busy dying""

He made several from wood that survived a church fire. He donated a few to the pastor and some elders in the church and then donated the proceeds from the rest he made for the rebuild effort. 
There were a few he made from wood off the deck of the battleship but if be lying if I told you the particulars, I just don't remember 
Some of his favorite though are made out of shell casings from a bullet for the front part and deer antler turned on the lathe for the rear. I have to say though that backstory really takes the cake though.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/157119469/shawshank-tree-pens&&You want a toe? I'll get you a toe.&&I've seen wood in wood crafting stores billed as authentic pieces of 18th century ships. Only a few bucks more expensive then similar blanks, of which a skilled pen maker could use just as well.

It'll be yours in no time. &&Obviously the signatures.&&It‚Äôs in a big hayfield up near Buxton...One in particular. It's got a long rock wall, a big oak tree at the north end. It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me. We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak and I asked and she said yes. Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black, volcanic glass. There's something buried under it I want you to have.  If the tree ever gets cut down then make pens out if it to sell and be sure to make a post about it on reddit so you can get some karma out of this whole ordeal.&&The one on the hill where the box was buried in the Shawshank redemption movie&&Why does the distributer need to sign it though? I understand the craftsman,  it how many pens do they have to sell anyways? &&Looks like they go for $100-$125 on eBay. That's just slightly out of this month's pen budget for me.&&My friend did. He bought the wood blanks himself from the property owner.  Apparently he makes a lot of different kinds. &&What do you mean 'you people'? Hmm?&&That hurt my feelings.
&&It was near the penitentiary where the movie was filmed: Mansfield, Ohio. It blew down in a storm a few years back.&&Also where they carved ""Brooks was here"" was in the prison as well. The prison was actually abandoned after filming and almost torn down before being bought for tours, and looters actually cut the piece of wood out with the names. It was replaced with a remade one though.&&The note underneath the pen answers that.&&The divorce papers were signed with lead. /just sayin'&&The tree was knocked down in a storm.&&It was hit by lighting a couple years ago and died&&Dammit, missed it by a few hours.&&That was in the prison as well, they just used the angles to make it seem like it was somewhere else. The chunk of wood was stolen after the prison used to film was abandoned when they were done filming,  but then they replaced it after opening it for tours.

The guy went to jail at 33.  He was dead by 48.    

He was overweight and not the best looking person, but Hardy looks 70 here.  

Although I do think there's a general perception in public that he was much older when he rose to power, and had a much longer tenure.  

Reality was he came to power at 26 and was there for 7 years until being imprisoned.  That was the end for him.  

A lot of people have the impression though that he was a crime boss for decades, during his 40's/50's.  I guess from how he's been portrayed in prior film and television.    &&Why is anyone casting anyone other than Glenn Fleshler as Al Capone?

&&The awesome thing about acting is that people behave differently as different characters.&&Watch Peaky Blinders or Taboo. His scenes are awesome. &&[deleted]&&Watch Bronson, if you haven't.  Then you'll know for sure if you like him or not.&&For me, his greatness is really well demonstrated by how much he can do with so little. His eyes & physicality in TDKR convey so much.&&The movie I finally decided on was The Revenant.  I didn't realize it was him until about 2/3rd's through the movie.  I then decided yes, this man is a good actor.&&Think about this, he has to express all the emotion from the character with little words. That means he has to focus on posturing, facial expressions, reaction times to others lines in order to deliver an identity for that character. That is very hard to do, it‚Äôs much easier to give a character personality when you can deliver lines in a certain way.&&You have to pay attention to his entire performance. I want to say it comes down to his timing and subtle gestures. I think he‚Äôs masterful but just my opinion. &&Locke, The Drop, Inception, Bronson, The Revenant for which he was nominated for and acted circles around Leo Dicaprio, Warrior, Mad Max, TDKR, Dunkirk, Legend etc... Yeah he's a pretty great actor.

I like how people aren't liking the Venom trailer and they are suddenly saying Tom Hardy isn't a good actor... like WTF?&&I'd go as far to say he's one of the best actors that can carry a role that only has a few lines. &&He does get type casted to a certain extent. Although with any actor, that's usually not their fault. Hardy can definitely play roles other than the beefed up baddy. He was great in Peaky Blinders.&&Have you seen Legend? I'd say he is a great actor.&&My alltime favorite actor. 
Bronson!
Lawless!
Legend!
Etc&&Watch Stuart: A life backwards, then watch a four part drama called The Take. That should make your mind up.&&>  Lots of his roles have been him in costume with very few lines

See this is why I think he's a great actor. Even when he has few lines or has his face covered by a mask he is really good at conveying emotion and my eyes are always glued on him when he's in scene. He just has a real presence about him. Have you seen Legend? That's a good one where he isn't hampered by a mask. &&Idris Elba was in that!?

He was from New York and he was Italian but he wasn't a made man or even ""a friend of ours"" (or whatever the 1910's version of that would've been)

He was a hood and a bouncer who hooked up with a guy named Johnny Turrio, moved to Chicago, and helped Turrio form the Chicago Outfit.

If you were a made man in one of the Five Families and were smart and, more important not stupid or reckless, you could live a nice long life.

Thank you! Leo did a great job too IMO but Hardy completely stole that movie. It‚Äôs by far my favorite role by him.&&For my money Tom Hardy is one of the best working actors today. His only drawback is the inflections he chooses from time to time. But in terms of pure physical presence and facial expressions, he is a powerhouse.

I just wish he wouldn't take roles where the character seems to need to grumble or grunt. Performances like Inception, Bronson, Locke, and Legend show he can be lucid, clear, and charismatic. And he's really good in those roles it just seems like so many casting directors want the tough looking guy to sound tough. &&Shame scheduling made his role in Peaky limited. Every scene he's in he's just oozing with pure intensity. Sometimes when watching the show I get distracted by my phone or other things but when Hardy was on the screen he'd get my undivided attention. &&Tom Hardy is phenomenal in Legend!

I have no doubt Tom Hardy can play Capone. I don't think this makeup looks good at all. I'm sure this is just him in a trailer getting makeup done but his hand isn't even made up. Capone didn't look that aged in photos.&&Can we see all of those people's reactions after the movie was released?&&Wait what? Can we get a tl;dr?&&I thought they only posted part of it and he never came back?

I listened to it and it sounds like some he said she said stuff too... he blamed a lot on the studio which is legit... but also the studio basically had to take it away from him due to alleged substance abuse and other major issues during the project.  

I think there is probably some of the ‚Äútruth is in the middle‚Äù scenario here. &&Well the movie was kinda screwed at the point when he tweeted that so it was really more about Thank saving face if anything.

And a pickpocket!&&He was much easier to understand in Dunkirk, honestly one of his best performances imo, partly because his voice wasn‚Äôt distracting.

Kinda like someone puts headphones on you for his lines only and takes them off for everyone else.

That probably doesn't make sense. What you said was better.

I agree, is my point.&&I thought they did that because in the original edit it was too hard to understand him. By making him sound more like Sean Connery it was easier to make out just what the fuck he was talking about. 

Edit: seen your other posts confirming this.&&Totally agree. I remember the first time I saw it in theaters (saw it 4 times lol) the first time he spoke I was taken aback by how his voice completed dominated the audio.

Capone was part of setting up and organising things in Chicago, and avoided the intra-family type of wars thats taken place in NY. What he helped set up ran smoothly for decade after decade after decade.  The NY families have killed each other, the Outfit in Chicago has not had those types of conflict. The Outfit in Chicago has always been well run, the city of Chicago far more corrupt than NY and the Outfit had a much tighter grip on the political machinery there than the Mafia in NY ever managed to get. &&how high are you&&The millenium falcon approaches!

It was a very well-written character, but Hardy's performance really made it memorable.

To be honest - it's very possible. Studio meddling is absolutely majorly a thing and that movie reeks of it.

It pretty much blacklisted him, among other things&&Perfectly Malkovich. As all things should be. &&This is the remake of mystery men I never knew I needed.&&I disagree. I‚Äôd give the edge to Crews.&&No! Your description is just as good if not better than mine. 

I remember how clearly it sounded in the sneak preview, much more within the mix, and yet tough to make out his words. His lines were much more mumble-y, more ""buried in the mask"". But they overcompensated for the final product, I think. [Hearing the voice change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZW5qyc2g6U) was jarring for me in the theatrical release.

In my opinion it sounded much better before release. You can't make out all of his words but it kind of didn't matter, what with Hardy being a very talented physical actor and all. And it's actually really intimidating to think of a person like Bane but you can't understand everything he's saying. 

Lol I can go on, I'm salty aout this movie, I wish it had been better.
&&I mean, Brock was never really stupid either.&&One of the dogs died as well. There was dog shit left all over the house. The house was trashed. His speech after the production meeting was the most uninspiring thing ive ever heard. I also worked on the film. Guess i should have started with that...&&Yeah you can‚Äôt leave us hanging like that.&&No it‚Äôs hi, how are you? &&He just needed to get something off his chest. &&That's a botched toe!&&All I know is that's going to be the most jacked depiction of Capone that I've ever seen unless he goes with prosthetics or does a Christian Bale transformation.  Hardy is built like a brick shithouse.  &&Reminds me of the gangster with the big hunchback in Dick Tracy&&I'm almost positive that this is a Dick Tracy reboot.&&lmao

spot on.&&I'm aww cawpown&&Pineapple*&&A very underrated movie, IMO.&&The three leads in that movie (Hardy, Edgerton, and Nolte) were all incredible. Such a great film&&That movie makes me cry. &&Lawless was great too &&Alright that‚Äôs enough out of you&&Alright this got me.&&Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't live up to his performances.&&[deleted]&&Didnt he wanted to make Chronicle 2 instead of Fantastic Four?&&I haven‚Äôt actually seen it (being one of very few superhero movies I haven‚Äôt seen) but I was actually interested assuming they were adapting Ultimate Fantastic Four. I lost interest when everyone on the movie said it was a shit pile. Fan reaction didn‚Äôt really deter me but them calling it ‚ÄúFan-Four-Stick‚Äù made me want to see it slightly more out of spite. That logo was cool&&I feel like the studio didn't let him do what he wanted because he was being a massive cunt.&&It clearly didn't blacklist him if he made this film. Also it wasn't just that tweet- he was horrible on set and completely destroyed his house that the studio gave to him. If I remember correctly, insurance called it a total loss. 

No one knows why he's still working as his reputation in LA is horrible. &&Definitely, there‚Äôs a bunch of clips from the trailer that were cut from the final release&&[deleted]&&Both wrong. Whoopsie Goldberg wins in a landslide &&tell me about it, its a two hour masterpiece hidden within a two and a half hour mess&&My name is Ryan. Not ""hi"". And I'm only slightly high. Now I'm going to watch Star Wars for the lol's.&&Do not plug a open wound with *trash.*

Ugh it's bleedin' like a siv!&&They are both around the same height and old Al Capone was considerably heavier.&&This town is like one big chicken&&clean version: https://youtu.be/kZgE_sUrXFY&&Me too.   I rarely get emotional for a movie. And if I do its for a split second and then im good.  That movie hits me hard though.  But Im a ex marine with brother issues and I do martial arts so it hits all the strings on my heart guitar. 

&&I agree. The movie was pretty underwhelming but I thought Hardy did a really good job with it. &&Happened in Child 44 too. I'm hoping this isn't another Hardy film where he's the only reason to give up an hour or two of your day. &&Some buddies of mine worked on F4, and they said it was a collossal train wreck of a production all around.&&There were stories about his dogs trashing his rental property, and the studio paying for it. None of his cast defended him. I‚Äôm sure the studio interfered, but probably for good reason - he sounded like a loose cannon. 

&&I feel like his defininite version would have been total shit too, but he's so full of himself that he couldn't see past it. Like Uwe Boll, who had repeatedly been asked by gamers to stop making movies adapted from video games.&&""Pretty much blacklisted.""&&*~nods head constantly~* **Malkovich.**&&Malkovich Malkovich, Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.&&No. It's [H.I.](http://i.imgur.com/RtmwTbv.jpg)&&Ya okay we didn't ask you for your whole life story.&&Heavy as in fat, not heavy as in biceps the size of grapefruits and traps that are 1/4 of the way up his neck&&Just waiting to get *plucked*.&&I‚Äôm endlessly fascinated by this. Did they say anything about Trank‚Äôs behavior?&&Didn't the FF crew wear t-shirts saying ""at least we're not working on Terminator Genisys""?&&I heard he smeared his shit all over the walls after he was kicked out.&&That's only for a few films, he usually walks around at 170lbs or slightly more. Capone was over 200lbs.&&That's not at all what Tom Hardy looks like. He got pretty jacked for Batman and Bronson but he's a thin athletic looking guy.&&That sounds like the easiest transformation then. Christian Bale went from his jacked Batman role straight into being overweight/obese for American Hustle by eating/drinking ice cream all the time and stopping all exercise.

Hardy could easily go from Bane to Al Capone, if that's what the people making the movie want. As for why they didn't do that...I have no clue.&&I heard he left jizz on the good sheets.&&",2018-08-01 14:23:05

On the real though theyre both fantastic actors, Id pay to see that alone, but the plot is dope and its about something not a ton of people are aware of; the Green Book.&&Things as king of the middle earth ain't working out. &&I thought it might be a new David Cronenberg film.... damn.  &&Wow, weird Marlon Brando energy to Viggo in that shot.&&SALT N PEPPAS HERE&&Is this eastern promises 2?

And again at Linda Cardellini&&Lotr 4 looking tight&&I love vintage or vintage-setting films, and the color scheme in this shot looks gorgeous. I also think Viggo is excellent, will definitely be watching :)&&In these controversial times with cis actors playing trans roles, it has been deemed necessary that Linda Cardellini play the car in this movie. &&Liam Neeson and Eddie Murphy could've also pulled off this shot &&Ed Harris & Eddie Murphy?&&Why does Mahershala Ali look like he was kind of badly photoshopped into the back of the car?&&Shut up and take my money!&&There‚Äôs a children‚Äôs book about the green book. I‚Äôd never heard of it until then.

And his smile......damn&&I'll watch anything that Viggo is in...he knows how to pick a film&&Whatever this movie is about I want in&&This reminds me Eric Clapton's Riding With the King album cover.&&I'll probably watch anything that has Viggo in it. Too bad he isn't making more movies. &&I'm personally excited to see Linda Cardellini in this movie! I've loved her stuff from "" Freaks and Geeks"" to "" Bloodline"" which was on netflix recently! Viggo and Ali are legendary as well, I can't wait to go see this one it should be amazing.&&I love me some complete lack of B Pillar.&&No idea what this is but I‚Äôm very interested.&&We need more Vigo. &&You had me at Viggo and Marhershala &&Aragorn!&&The return of our king! It‚Äôs nice seeing Viggo in the lead again.&&Viggo ages like Aragorn &&I would love a reprisal of his character in eastern promises. It would never happen, but i think he owned that role like no one else ever could &&He's had a quiet decade, and has been working more on [his books](https://www.percevalpress.com/) than movies, by the looks of it. What movies he has done have tended to be small, art-house works. I've seen most of them, and can offer a few recommendations if you want to catch up:

His last major film before Captain Fantastic was [The Two Faces of January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrRHmhIDfjg), a thriller which I really liked. Viggo's fantastic, and Oscar Isaac and Kirsten Dunst are pretty great in it, too.

He starred in and produced a crazy little Argentinian film called [Jauja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C8vYvgHlVg). It's almost entirely without dialogue through about 70% of the film (apart from Viggo swearing in Danish), and features long scenes that were often decided by however much film the director had left to work with. 

[Far From Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQra-kMeXPQ) was a French/Arabic language film, so didn't get much attention, but is quite riveting and features great performances by the two leads. 

EDIT: Forgot to link to [Viggo's publishing house](https://www.percevalpress.com/). He puts out some really interesting work; it's worth checking out!

EDIT 2: I only just now noticed your username. *Crusty jugglers! Doggggg muckkkk!*&&Why does Ali look like he‚Äôs been photoshopped in?&&Two years is literally years!&&Hahah I felt same exactly! Seeing his face actually put a smile on my face, such a brilliant brilliant actor! &&Saw him recently on an Argentinian movie, and his acting in Spanish is as good as it is in English.&&When you watch LotR every month you can see him in a movie much more frequently! &&2 years&&Same! We just don't get enough of the man.&&It looks like they've cut and pasted viggo mortensen's face onto the head of a much larger guy, but it's just the receding hair line they've given him&&And that‚Äôs just the way he likes it. &&I love Vigo. Even if I've seen his dick a little more than I planned to.

from russia with love.&&I‚Äôm still getting over the road. Such an amazing movie. The love between dad and son almost has me weeping on demand. I really want to be a dad. It sucks not being a father. &&Was it good? Last I saw him I think was A History Of Violence... which I was rather fond of.&&Putting the ""car"" in Cardellini.&&Method acting has really gotten out of hand lately&&[deleted]&&I bet Mortensen‚Äôs character will start out racist and get redeemed.&&Directed by a Farrelly brother too&&> They must rely on the ‚ÄúNegro Motorist Green Book‚Äù to guide them to the few establishments that were then safe for blacks.

Listen to this podcast as well regarding the green book.

&&Whoa, they made a movie about the Green Book? Sold! More people need to know about this. &&Hollywood elevator pitch: It's Driving Miss Daisy crossed with Ray! Seriously, I'd watch Viggo in anything. Cardellini was so great in Mad Men. Looking forward to it &&What this doesnt mention is that it is based on a true story. One of the writers of the film, Nick Vallelonga, is the son of Tony Lip (Mortensen) and Dolores Vallelonga. 

Nick wrote this story based on his father's life and encounter with Don Shirley (Ali's character). The pair remained best friends after this experience until their death.

I think she‚Äôll be ok. &&Viggoooo where the hell you been&&I cannot fucking wait for this for so many damn reasons. &&This will be interesting.

And this went down around 50 years ago.&&Sold &&I'll see any movie with Ali, but damn this sounds interesting.&&That sounds absolutely fantastic omg&&> a world-class pianist

Ok I can suspend judgment now&&Wow that sounds super interesting. With Viggo and Mahershala too? I'm in&&I‚Äôm not usually a fan of heavy themes in movies but for some reason this sounds super interesting &&I can‚Äôt wait to see this. Brilliant casting!&&Yes please. &&You had me at Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.&&Holy shit this premise, I am in. &&Watching the fuck out of this. I know about the Green Books, but wanted more on the story without bringing up bad memories for people that had to use 'em.    

Fuckin‚Äô silver cloud in a nasty chunk of history.&&Wow. What a great plot. &&This sounds fantastic! &&Fuck yes, people need to remember shit like the green book existed thanks to the institutionalized racism of society&&Fantastic. I've read a lot about the green book and would love to see a story involving it. Sounds like potential for a super fascinating story for sure.&&Holy crap. I did a whole story on the man who created the Green Book (Victor Green) awhile ago: https://www.nalc.org/news/the-postal-record/2013/september-2013/document/09-2013_green-book.pdf&&I mean, he's one of the Dunedain. Strain of elvish blood and all that. &&Everyone always says that about celebs. They have money, piece of mind and spend a lot of time and effort on looking good. Not to mention makeup, stylists and digital effects on promotional shots.&&Aragorn looks thicc.&&As he gets older, he looks more and more like Jim Carrey when he's wearing the mask.&&""Bounce? We're bouncing now? That's what we're doing? Jesus fucking Christ."" &&Wow, nailed it. When is the movie out?&&And Mahershala kinda looks like Eddy Murphy&&Sure was! Count me in too though - i see Viggo, I see the movie &&He's so soulful. &&You're so right about The Road.  Jesus, wasn't  I in a heap on the floor for a week after it ! &&Everybody says it was depressing and sad, and, yes it was portrayed that way, but to me the underlying message was indelibly hopeful.

To me it was an allegory about parenthood and abortion.

The world was dead.  The man was dying.  The mother, suicidal, and beyond approach.  She wanted to kill the boy to prevent what could be.  The son could grow up only to starve, to be murdered, to be captured and raped, eaten by cannibals.  

You can imagine a man in OUR world, not destroyed yet, but seemingly headed that way and definitely not the one he grew up in.  His own life fleetingly short, staring across at a woman who's lost the will to live, with a doctors report that their child will be disfigured, disabled, defective, will not live a normal life, will probably die before getting to see all the beauty that makes life worth living. 

A father who could not, would not, no matter what, give up on giving his son a chance.  At something.  Maybe not the life he wanted or envisioned or would've preferred, but, his son's OWN chance at life, in whatever world is left.  Even if he would not live to see how it ended.

The Road is a harrowing journey indeed - but it's a mini apocalypse that many people are living through right now, with as much dignity as they can muster, keeping the fire alive.  &&The Lord of the Rings...&&I feel like you're forgetting a big one here&&A Perfect Murder. It's great on two levels: 

it has Viggo in it and it's all about trying to kill Gwyneth Paltrow...who if you know anything about her, she's very, *very* annoying.&&And used to be married to a rock star...at least in my circle she was. Exene was our queen back in the day, back in El Lay.&&It‚Äôs crazy because when The Indian Runner came out, I only knew who he was because he was married to Exene Cervenka.&&Appaloosa! Watched a significant portion of the movie in a waiting room, when I got home I watched the whole thing again. So incredibly good&&The ones with cronenberg are awesome&&History of Violence was crazy as fuck.  Not at all what I expected going into it, but I really enjoyed that movie.&&Thanks for mentioning The Road. Very underrated movie.&&For real. I've been a fan of his ever since House of Cards.

its cool now

&&They probably won't give a damn ^^about ^^your ^^damn ^^reputation!&&It looks like a ['61 Cadillac 4-door sedan](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5183/5632803137_273897d0d7.jpg). It has two separate windows, but no post between them like you typically see in most cars so with both windows down it has a very stylish, open, phaeton type look.

Edit: I think it's actually a ['62](https://cadillacs-for-sale.com/wp-content/cadillacs-for-sale.com/2017/08/turquoise-1962-cadillac-deville-4-door-hardtop-for-sale-2017-08-09-1-1024x765.jpg).&&It's called a hardtop, they were super popular in the USA from the [1950s](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDG82fN8dwI/maxresdefault.jpg) to the [1970s](http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/31701/27437425_1.jpg), and in Japan from the [1970s](https://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/nissan/cedric/autowp.ru_nissan_cedric_hardtop_2.jpg) to the [1990s](https://www.japanclassic.ru/upload/cars/mazda/persona/1988_ma/big/1988_ma_11_b.jpg). You can still get some European luxury cars as hardtops too, like many [Mercedes](https://di-uploads-pod2.s3.amazonaws.com/mbencino/uploads/2015/04/Model-Lineup-Page-2015-S-CLASS-COUPE-GALLERY-011-GOE-D.jpg) and [Rolls-Royce](http://4-photos7.motorcar.com/used-2015-rolls~royce-wraith-2drcoupe-12105-17452157-5-1024.jpg) coupes, but four doors haven't been produced since the early 1990s (although a significant proportion of concept cars [are still designed as hardtops](https://hips.hearstapps.com/amv-prod-cad-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cadillac-Escala-concept-103.jpg) because they look so gorgeous).

The name comes from ""hardtop convertible"" because they were originally made by welding a steel roof onto a convertible body. Basically they use the window mechanism of a convertible, where the front and rear windows meet to form a seal, rather than having a metal pillar between the front and rear doors. The story goes that a GM executive noticed that his wife always bought convertibles but never put the roof down because she liked how airy and open it felt with the windows rolled down, so they started making them as a specialty option.

Originally they [started as two-doors](http://2-photos5.motorcar.com/used-1949-cadillac-coupe_deville-series62-145-3091493-4-800.jpg), sharing everything except the roof with the convertible models so that they didn't have to do any new engineering, but it spread to four door models in 1955 and later even [station wagons](https://www.conceptcarz.com/images/Chrysler/60-Chrysler_NewYorker_TwnNCntry_DV-08_CbS_01.jpg), and by the 1960s you could get practically any car as a hardtop (and some models weren't even available as pillared sedans at all). Eventually they were mostly discontinued in the 1970s because automakers didn't want to redesign them to meet new safety regulations, although European luxury car companies could afford to keep up with the new regulations and never stopped making hardtop coupes and Japan had a brief obsession with four-door hardtops during the Bubble Economy of the 1980s-1990s.

As you can tell I'm pretty obsessed with them. I even created a subreddit for hardtops a few years ago and promptly forgot about it and never tried to promote it so I'm still the only member. /r/hardtops if anyone is interested.&&Same here.

By the sounds of his last few interviews, he may have informally retired from directing. 

EDIT: From [an interview](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/david-cronenberg-death-of-cinema-film-novel-golden-lion-the-fly-naked-lunch-a8450566.html) last month.

*He has always accepted that the ‚ÄúHollywood version of movie making is very difficult‚Äù. Even the biggest name directors like his friend Martin Scorsese struggle to secure financing and full creative freedom on their projects. ‚ÄúPeople think, well, Marty, he‚Äôs famous; he has won this and that ‚Äì he can snap his fingers and get anything made. Of course, it is absolutely not true. It is always a struggle.‚Äù*&&A History of Violence and Eastern Promises are modern classics&&I would be okay with that too &&Last I heard, it was in development hell *without* Viggo or Cronenberg attached. They'd officially been left by the wayside on it.&&It was to be titled Body Cross, and they were gearing up to shoot as recently as last spring. Then nothing. &&Kind, considerate, generous - all words that come up again and again in interviews with him. He's infamous for greeting interviewers with gifts, and for being [the chocolate fairy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVp97TbUOC4) on set. If you haven't had a chance before, try finding [some of his poetry](https://www.google.ca/search?q=viggo+mortense+poetry&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtwvK97OXcAhVG3IMKHTFoDBUQ_AUoAXoECA4QAw&biw=1121&bih=890). It's as sensitive and thoughtful as you'd expect from him.&&I haven't made it through Good, despite the twin draws of shirtless Viggo and sexy Jason Isaacs (hello to him!) His performance was uncharacteristically weak, and the story wasn't doing much for me to the point where I gave up. I also haven't tackled Todos Tenemos un Plan, which got fairly terrible reviews. (It's hard to find.) I've seen almost all of his work apart from those, though.

EDIT: Added some pre-ROTK suggestions on another comment. I should also recommend [Appaloosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw1XFu-mFVk) is a strange little film. Half buddy-cop, half postmodern Western. The plot is fairly rote, and Renee Zellweger is terrible, but the scenes with Viggo and Ed Harris are wonderful. 

I haven't yet been able to sit down and watch [Alatriste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHYEjR6N3OM) through, but the first 10 minutes were spectacular and I know it gets a ton of love from the Spanish-speaking Internet. I get the impression it's like a Iberico Indiana Jones adventure film. &&I went on a big Viggo kick last year during a period of unemployment/depression, and tried to watch as much of his catalogue as I could find. His pre-LOTR offerings are far more scattershot - he was taking whatever work he could find to pay the bills - but there are some hidden gems in there.  

He made two films with Philip Ridley that [he still talks up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqWO_EWTcQI), even 30 years later. I've seen the second ([The Passion of Darkly Noon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHFhUt60xxo)) and it is trippy as hell. The first ([The Reflecting Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxlnDRqPUXE)) I've bought but haven't had the chance to watch yet. It's a cult classic, apparently, and looks gorgeous. 

[American Yakuza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwLQ41LUnik) is a B-movie, but far more entertaining than it has any business being. Stick with it through the opening, which is terrible - it improves exponentially. 

He was terrific as the man-of-conscience in [Crimson Tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4I2Z1RBIw) - I feel like that one didn't get the hype that [GI Jane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrXl6WOPZA) did (he was great in Jane too, but Tide is more watchable).

And the movie that set him up for leading man-dom was [A Walk on the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlb2pESsygo), a chick flick with a truly impossible choice to make for Diane Lane: Sexpot Viggo or adorable family man Liev Schreiber? (My personal choice is *both*... Panty soup.)

As for the rest of his filmography, he had a lot of small roles in terrible films where he was often the best thing on the screen. He's a man dedicated to his craft and his art, and even if his films aren't always good, his performances are reliably intriguing. The stars feel like they're aligning for Green Book: As a Viggo nut, a history student, and a Don Shirley aficionado, I am beyond hyped.&&Wonderful, thank you. &&They had me at Linda Cardellini.&&On top of those two, Linda makes my pants tight&&No more.  &&They fall in love.&&*Mahershala laughs suddenly*&&Yo Viggos looks great here.

[STOP MAKING THAT FUCKING MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA1ZU8LDpVE)&&Yeah back then no one really liked the ""dagos"" and ""wops"", Italian Americans were also heavily discriminated against&&I wish. It‚Äôs just obvious the way his character is described, if they want to ham up that Oscar bait even more he will die protecting Ali‚Äôs character. &&[deleted]&&Yes. &&And at the end they drive into Gondor, Dukes of Hazard style and give it the aid it so desperately needs.&&Viggo ate so much food. Every take, every scene you see with food, was him ACTUALLY devouring the food. He gained weight in order to play the character accurately.

I appreciate you.&&He was originally cast as Stu, the I.T guy in What We Do in the Shadows.&&Hidalgo is way better than not bad. It's a fantastic movie and a fun time whenever I watch it.&&The 4400 is worth checking out. He was great on that show.&&I feel like the show never recovered after his arc ended. I've seen it all,  Bushmaster and his posse should totally have a spin off show about Jamaican gang life in Harlem, and I just feel Cottonmouth had so much more gravitas than any others. 
Diamondback was a terrible antagonist imo atleast, Cottons sister is interesting for sure, but the dichotomy between her and Cottonmouths lives, with an under-current of similar instincts, was just a treat to watch. &&Agreed. He was replaced by such a lame-ass bad guy...&&I disagree! Season 2 was very different, but I think it was even better!&&Because his movies are art-house films, and studios these days are looking more for profit-making than kudos-earning. &&Cronenberg is niche. I love his body of work but his weird, mostly body-horror, sci-fi movies are not going to appeal the general public. Sure his more recent movies have moved away from straight horror (and the movies he did with Viggo are arguably some of his best) but those aren't the movies that bring people to theaters anymore.

Honestly his best bet would be to move to television. Maybe do a solid single season series as a sequel to Eastern Promises (he spoke of wanting to do a sequel).&&The plot of Eastern Promises is more thrilling, but man, his performance in History of Violence should have netted him an Oscar.

Seriously though- humorous comment but now I know the outcome.

EDITED to avoid spoilage &&‚ÄúGet out of the pool!‚Äù&&She's all 'bout dem saggy balls &&I just ran through the first four audiobooks (the author died after the 4th so any of the rest of the series weren't written by Parker) and the fun dialogue and camaraderie between them is directly drawn from the text. Unfortunately, Renee Zellweger's character is also directly drawn from the text, and is *even more annoying* than in Appaloosa. &&I heard they filmed it in Malibu Creek State Park only on overcast days.&&The whole fucking movie is great scene after great scene. When they both are interrogated in separate rooms, how both handle the situation without saying anything. I really like that movie.&&Stu is a GIS technician, not an IT guy! He tries to explain it to other characters at least 3 times in the movie and never gets anywhere. Love Stu, good guy. &&I loved that show, too bad it was canceled, and I remember it leaving lots of shit unanswered.&&He was definitely the most improved actor on that show.  I knew when I finished it that he would be the one to go on to movies.&&Yup the musical score and cottonmouth made season 1 for me. He played the role so impressively &&I totally agree and never had anyone to tell it to. Cottonmouth was a great antagonist, Mahershala Ali played it perfectly too, sinister laughs and all. After him, I completely lost interest in the story and Diamondback was the nail in the coffin. I never went from loving one antagonist to completely hate everything about another. I still haven't seen the second season for that exact reason. I'm just not invested anymore. Shades was ok, I guess.&&At least Bushmaster turned out well!&&But we have Netflix and Amazon now. It doesn't have to make money. It just has to get watched. &&I don't know, there is demand for that sort of stuff. I reckon Netflix would be down to put something on track. It might be a 10 ep show instead of a feature length but he can still work his magic.&&I'd be interested in seeing what the long-term profitability is like for well-known art-house films. Ones that aren't necessarily popular at their release, but become stronger over time through word-of-mouth.

Without that data on-hand, I do think there is merit to ""kudos-earning"" films in that good films will always be good and maintain a slow stream of profit. Bad films will always be bad. [insert Miyamoto quote here]&&It doesn‚Äôt help that Oscars are adding ‚Äúpopular film‚Äù categories, further signaling the decline of the ‚Äúart house‚Äù films.&&Can I send him $40 towards a good sequel? Like maybe Future of Violence.&&As I said in another comment, I'm sure Netflix would welcome him for a 10 ep show. Put Viggo in it too and we are in business.&&The bit on the stairs made me too uncomfortable to watch HoV again, but it was a great movie overall.&&It should've started shooting March 2017 according to the articles I can find. Nothing more recent than that, so it's maybe safe to say it ain't happening.&&One of their Cannes press conferences. It's just one of [many](http://media.zenfs.com/en-CA/blogs/celebrity-news/140310b-cronenberg.jpg), [many](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/93/f3/91/93f391fd70ce6b456df68d90f9143314.jpg) [examples](http://specials.rediff.com/entertai/2005/may/17slide2.jpg), though. They are very close and, [as Billy Boyd pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8XZ6KxE30I), Viggo is an affectionate man.&&Life.&&Omg, she's like a hot Pam from the Office.

Well I didn't think I'd ever have a desire to watch that movie&&Ooof she is so sexy in ""she could probably kick my ass and outdrink me"" kinda way. 

Damn Linda Cardellini.&&Link?&&Well she has a happy family with Hawkeye.&&Yep, and Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame created Brazil, 12 Monkeys etc. Having a history in comedy definitely doesn't preclude success in serious genres. &&*Good* comedy is harder than drama. Whatever the fuck Adam Sandler is off doing right now is slightly less difficult than passing gas. &&I would have followed you

My brother

My captain

My king.&&>non-Protestants

So Catholics?&&Oh geez, sorry. Never occurred to me. I was a history student so I never consider this stuff spoilery, just history. :)&&What&&All the scenes in his club, while he was the proprietor were fantastic. &&Diamondback made me do various activities while the show was on. Seemed like he was trying sooooo hard to be a big bad.

The second season has a surprisingly good antagonist in the Bushmaster, but honestly Bush and his crew absolutely steal the season. I found myself far more interested in Jamaican inter gang politics of war vs peace, what they've built up, etc.

Shades is alright yeah, but I'll never unsee him being raped by Marilyn Manson in Sons of Anarchy, and always reminds me of that. &&From what I‚Äôve heard, both Netflix and Amazon have extremely specific data they exploit to decide what to invest in. Right down to the actors chosen and the length of the content vs the genre. Many directors would not like to have to satisfy those types of requirements to get financing. &&And we have distributors like A24 and Blumhouse&&You hit the nail on the head.  There is demand for that, just not in theater released films.&&The Oscars can also suck my nutsack.  As a filmmaker, I don't even watch the Oscars.  Yea, I'd be happy if my film was good enough to get an award, but I'd be more happy that people are just watching my films. Perhaps, that's just my mindset rn since I am nobody from Wisconsin currently.  

^(Where's that razor?)&&Holy crap I would watch the fuck out of this. Someone approach Cronenberg, Viggo and Netflix ASAP.&&Yeah, for drama/niche stuff, TV/streaming is where it's at now. Which is good since they still manage to get decent budgets to do quality productions and more running time to develop characters and complex storylines.&&I cant quite remember, but it was consensual sex wasn't it? I just remember it being the most violent sex scene I'd ever seen.&&I knew Viggo was an affectionate man ever since that 69 scene in HoV&&I can't believe the internet is not giving them shit over their bromance.&&But Pam already is a hot Pam from the Office. &&Was thinking of Pam from Mallory Archer's office... Which she is kinda hot as well.&&Maybe not the exact one you're looking for, buuut...

https://youtu.be/WDjymhJeDwY&&>!more like had, probably<&&[deleted]&&And Jews. I tried to go for the blanket statement and apparently fell short, like a Klansman on an IQ test.&&It's all good, I love reading up on backstory, but usually AFTER I watch a movie.  There's only one time you get to see it for the *first* time.&&You fucking heard him&&Bushmaster was by far the most entertaining in season 2. I hope they can continue that level of antagonist interest in season 3. His ambitions and motivations were much better than ""I just want ALL the money"" like the other main antagonist. Season 3 should see some interesting conflicts between the characters, especially internal conflicts within Luke. 

And shades was okay. But everytime I saw him on screen I could only think it was Juice trying to act cool. &&So many of their shows have redundant storytelling technics that I started to wonder if I wasn‚Äôt the type of viewer they envisioned for their content. &&A24 and Blumhouse work with really small budgets&&Have a link to any of your films?&&She'd be like a 6 in New York but, she's a 7 in Scranton.&&Same with Karen from behind. &&Coked out Pam. Uughnn.&&Impressive. She fell because she was trying to lick her own tiddy &&You know, it wasn't until this moment that I really thought about how there's a solid chance parents could be left alive while their children were torn from their arms. It's going to wind up just being Hawkeye and his wife left. Or just Clint.

. . . And without a family, I can finally get Fraction's ""good at his job but constantly implodes, taking his personal life with him"" Hawkeye. Or maybe Clint will disappear and Kate will pick up the bow. I'd give my left nut to have have Kate Bishop in the MCU. She's my favorite. &&Too soon.&&""A dibba dabba dibby I fawted granmaw hehe dabba dibba"" -Adam Sandler&&I chuckled. Well done. &&I seem to be the exception on spoilers - I don't mind them at all. If a story is gripping me during the viewing, my brain doesn't skip ahead. I'm in the moment.  &&Take this data point. Ted Sarandos has mentioned many times how far down they drill including how long into a show watchers get before taking their first pause break and depending on how long the break is they can reasonably guess what you were doing during that break such as using the bathroom. They have done some user surveying to confirm if they were correct in their assumptions. 

The talk now is whether or not they are using this information to guide the actual content so that story peaks and plot twists occur at more desirable points in the length of a program making the experience more pleasant for the user but at the same time engaging them longer to stay on the platform. 

As a side note, read Infinite Jest. &&Blumhouse generally doesn't go over 5 million as I remember. &&Well... I ain't nothing spectacular yet so i feel like you're gonna be wildly disappointed but here's my vimeo: https://vimeo.com/cmoneywinter94&&Hell, Marilyn Monroe engagement dinner Pam...

Ah the days when affairs could destroy presidential campaigns&&Thank you.  I hadn't heard about this, so ""politician deals with a scandal"" didn't really narrow things down for me.&&As a non-American; why does this warrant a movie? Not in a derogatory way but I'm just curious why this scandal in particular gets a movie. Sex scandals aren't exactly rare after all, even pre-Trump. But maybe there's something special about this one that I'm missing?&&I was thinking Martin Freeman

&&Scrolled through the comments for this. Thank you. &&Bill Burr as George McGovern has to be one of the most bizarre casting choices in recent memory. &&I am too I love that guys comedy and just general opinion about everything&&And Kaitlyn, she was awesome in Justified.&&I just watched Tully a couple days ago and thought it was excellent.

WHAT A FAAAG&&Remember when Howard Deans hopes were dashed because he made a weird noise at a campaign rally &&Remember John Edwards? His fucking wife was dying. Was he the last one who actually faced any political consequences for an affair? &&Well this was the first one! That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs kind of a big deal. There was this unwritten code or rule where reporters wouldn‚Äôt report on that kind of thing because it was private/untoward/whatever. But then some decided to and it turned the whole world of politics upside down. There‚Äôs a really great radio lab episode about it. &&Hart's scandal was freaking massive at the time. &&It was the first major one in America- before this, politicians were given a degree of privacy in their personal lives by the press that they don‚Äôt give them anymore. Of course, I think that that‚Äôs a good thing, but it was still a pivotal moment in American politics.

In addition, Gary Hart was a political star who many expected to cruise to the Democratic nomination before giving Vice President Bush a strong run for his money.&&He was a well liked/popular progressive candidate and basically was on track to be the democratic nominee in the 1988 presidential election. The media made this affair the single issue they covered most about Hart (much like Clinton‚Äôs emails, they would just keep talking about it even when there was no new info, etc). Instead the nominee ended up being Michael Dukakis, and Bush best him handily. 


Hart was against war in the Persian gulf and so there‚Äôs a sort of feeling out there lamenting the 88 election in particular since there likely would have been no war in the Persian gulf in the 90s. Also, Hart was the kind of sharp candidate that saw the potential of technology and sponsored technology-forward legislation. If Hart had become President we‚Äôd potentially be living in a vastly different world today. 


If interested, I believe there are a few podcasts that have done a retrospective on Hart. Check out ‚ÄúOn the Media‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis American Life‚Äù for two examples. 


In my opinion it‚Äôs an interesting story and sort of a Greek tragedy in the way it played out, however this recent obsession I am not so sure is healthy... sort of seems like obsessing too much on the past and focusing on ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù


In my opinion, people are so focused on Hart‚Äôs story as a way of trying to make sense of how the Democratic Party has gone off track over the last couple decades, and his story is seen as being related in some way. Basically the Democrats are so beleaguered and dumbfounded that we are in this situation with Trump as president that we are digging up every shitty thing that happened over the last 3 decades to somehow come up with a magic formula to fix whatever it is that is happening right now. 

&&I wasn‚Äôt alive at the time but we did cover this when I was in college and it has more to do with the absolute circus that it became in the media. That, as my professor put it, ‚Äúwould make anything that happens today look incredibly tame.‚Äù&&It must've been the meundies reads that clenched him the role &&I was wondering who Burr was going to play. I hadn't got to imdb yet. Thank you.&&>  George McGovern

I googled him and yep that's Ole Billy No-hair.&&Wait. What.....?   I love Bill more than the next person, but McGovern? Really?&&Have you seen Young Adult? It‚Äôs fantstic. Sane writer too. 

Edit: same writer, Diablo Cody&&ACETATE &&[Aha!](https://gfycat.com/WearyRespectfulFoal)&&More like Hugh Jackman &&I assume you mean[Sam Neill](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000554/?ref_=nv_sr_1)?  That was the first thought that popped into my head.&&Probably reviving the Whitey Willabee voice.&&Wow, i completely forgot Galifianakis was in Up in the Air&&Yea, those guys love acting. I don't see burr as an actor per say. I've listened to him for years and never talks about loving to act or anything. Movies or just stuff like that. But I hope he does good&&But they were already established as actors, not so much Bill Burr. I suppose you could argue F is for Family but it's not quite the same... Suppose he was pretty great in Breaking Bad.&&It blows my mind that actors, or even extras, don't think to clear themselves of personal items before they put on a costume.

And that nobody noticed it either before sharing this photo. I bet it even makes it into the final film. I'll watch it just to find out lol. &&Saw Mission Impossible last night, the mustache was totally worth it. &&My favorite part about this picture is that it seems to be a screen grab from the bootleg version of the movie. Nobody ever bothered to go back and watch justice league to get a new version of the picture. It was that bad. &&what am i looking at exactly&&https://youtu.be/WsOiE4FYHUo&&Will this be the new Peyton Manning face? I sure fuckin hope so&&I believe it's referring to the memes that came out of Henry's mustache being CGI'd out of Justice League. (He had another role going on at the time if I'm not mistaken.)&&It‚Äôs not like they meticulously shake them down to make sure they‚Äôre not wearing modern stuff. They brief them about it, obviously this guy just forgot or didn‚Äôt bother.&&If this guy is just a background performer/extra then it was his job to take off his watch. BG costumer or a wrangler may have caught it too but he was most likely told to remove all watches and rings unless specifically approved. If he is more than a bg performer then he still should have taken it off himself, but wardrobe should have looked a little more closely, he easily could have been reminded multiple times and still just not removed it when he should have. If it were supplied by the production technically it is props responsibility, but being a period piece before they existed this seems unlikely.  &&Why wouldn't the guy notice himself? Does he not know those didnt exist back then?&&Completely wardrobe. Art directors have nothing to do with wardrobe. &&I found one in my dad's drawers back in the 90s thinking to myself how ugly a square wristwatch was and no wonder it's been packed away for years....but here we are in 2018 and it's back&&I believe it's called script supervisor.&&Continuity department watches out for that stuff. &&Work on film sets - this is an art department / wardrobe thing. Continuity focuses on consistency from shot to shot when there are breaks in filming (think making sure an actor‚Äôs holding a pen in the same hand). So they - and many others on set - probably could and should‚Äôve have noticed this but it‚Äôs not exactly their job. &&This is the first film in the John Titor Cinematic Universe. &&Wait what time is this set in?&&Why are you going?!&&I love when guys dress up and come sacheting pass me&&*...and I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids!*&&Not surprised since that was almost 40 years ago oh boy&&[Where were you?](http://retromash.com/2016/09/30/top-ten-80s-watches/)&&My dad had (maybe has) a square watch with a black background.

The event where that scream happened was supposed to be a speech for him only coming in third in Iowa after leading the polls there for most of the cycle.&&Maybe it's me but every time I see that clip I don't get the huge fuss about it even by 2004 standards.&&No.

Howard Dean was never going to do better than 3rd or 4th overall at best. He had no party support and never bothered to get it. He was combative and couldn't build a national coalition for the life of him.

He only got the coverage he did because he did something first before anyone - he used the internet to raise money.

Party actors, Dem and Rep alike, watched him carefully to see if the internet could shift a tide. He was polling quite well leading up to Iowa, so with all of this together, he got a lot of coverage. Then Iowa voted and he placed third. That was all people needed to know, that Dean wasn't serious as they first expected, so his small support base moved on.

The Dean Scream was just a goofy moment in the news. It didn't shift his numbers. He still made third, at best, in the rest of his contests.

Howard Dean never had a chance to begin with, and his campaign was over before that speech happened. The Dean Scream, with it's reputation as a campaign ending 24/h news media hit job, is effectively a myth.&&Anthony Weiner and Blake Farenthold are more recent ones but in terms of Presidential campaigns John Edwards would be the recent one unless you count Herman Cain but let's be honest he had no shot at being President or VP. There is a Wikipedia page for this sort of thing and there have been quite a lot under the 2010-2018 section.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States#2010%E2%80%932018
&&Herman Cain had a 13-year affair that came to light during his presidential campaign in 2012.    

Eric Greitens, the former governor of Missourri, resigned June 1st amid several controversies including the blackmail of a woman he had an affair with.    

Tim Murphy, a Representative for Pennsylvania, had to resign when it was revealed the he pressured the woman he had an affair with to get an abortion.

Wikipedia has a list of all the [federal-level sex scandals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States#2010%E2%80%932018) Many are harassment or assault, but there have been a few career-ending (hopefully) affairs since Edwards.

&&He didn't really, though. He had already lost when the news of his affair broke. His career was already over. &&Pfft what about Newt Gingrich? His second wife was in the hospital with cancer and he divorced her for a younger blonder woman. Republicans didn‚Äôt say a peep about that. &&Ahh, got it thanks. I hope the movie will spend a good chunk on the media circus angle then. I mean the kind of media angle Nightcrawler had as well, that always fascinated me as much as it reviled me.&&This. Before Hart, no one would have imagined asking a Senator or Presidential candidate about their sex life. His scandal was a perfect storm. Someone leaked it to a newspaper who basically confirmed it by surveilling him. Then they printed it and he immediately denied it. The denial became the excuse for everyone else to print the story and the rest is history. That paper choosing to print that story changed the trajectory of American politics ever since. This was also during  the real ascendancy of the ‚Äúmoral majority‚Äù religious Right as a political force in America. Keep in mind that just a few years later, America had a president who would have seriously benefited from that whole ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt ask about their sex-lives‚Äù thing.     &&Thanks, the explanation is much appreciated.&&Oh man, ""On The Media"" is one of my favorite podcasts out there, and I don't think it gets enough love. Glad to see someone else suggest it for once!

[Also, I miss their old website design, I would just go through the archives on different topics and listen to episodes from the early 2000's all the time].

I thought they all get dressed 'by'/at the studio.&&He will never work in this town again.&&Because he‚Äôs an extra and is probably only getting paid for a couple of hours.&&This particular case overlaps with wardrobe, but you are correct! Any time you see an object magically moved, someone's hair brushed the wrong way in a shot or something like that, the script supe was slacking on continuity.&&There's no continuity department. The person in charge of that is called the script supervisor. They probably didn't notice because they were looking at a hundred other things and listening to the dialogue. Anybody else on set could have brought it up though. We once missed a homeless character wearing Airpods in a scene. It's hard to catch when you're in the middle of it.

The 2nd AD or Key Set PA are the ones that place background actors. They should have caught it or made sure to tell them during check in. Really, it's that actor's fault for not taking it off.&&They watch for watches&&I'm in the costume department -- the costume set supervisor is supposed to watch out for stuff like this! Even if they have BG Costumers helping that day, ultimately the costume set supervisor is the head of department on set!!

They definitely did not pay attention enough. &&So are you suggesting the reporter works for SERN?&&It's a movie about Gary Hart's 1988 presidential run.&&The year 2029 if I remember correctly.&&He‚Äôs gonna hit that button!!!!

I'm gonna bang his black wife&&Maybe I am forgetting something but wasn't he a front runner to be VP?&&There is a famous photo of him on a boat with his mistress, it's the kind of thing that previous politicians survived, like JFK, and Gary Hart thought he'd be ok. But it was seriously a tidal wave of press coverage and it was a total disaster. And like OP said, he was on track to be a major party leader, and the whole thing just fell apart. It's worth telling the story because it was a turning point for this country, politics, media, etc, and it should play out like a tragedy. &&There is a really good radio lab podcast about this story that really helps break it down. I‚Äôm on mobile, but I‚Äôll try to link to it. 

This was a post-watergate era and political journalists wanted to make sure the American people weren‚Äôt being duped again. Before Nixon, there were plenty of presidents that were known to have mistresses. It just didn‚Äôt matter until Nixon‚Äôs administration betrayed American trust and sort of shifted the responsibility to journalists to keep politicians in check. 

The story itself isn‚Äôt thrilling but‚Äîlike others have said‚Äîit was a pivotal moment in politics, as well as photag journalism and paparazzi. It changed the game on both sides. &&In my opinion, if you were good enough for Breaking Bad, you're good enough for just about anything.&&I haven't watched the movie but I saw one scene of him in that Kevin Costner movie black or white. It was an emotional scene and BillyRedTits nailed it.&&I haven't been listening recently but when I did for years it wasn't talking about movies. It was comics, sports and dollar shave club. I wish he acted in more &&He was also in Chappelle's show at least a couple of times.

‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs right bitches.

(Serious question)&&That aside, he could have put his watch on at any point after being briefed or looked over, it‚Äôs unlikely anyone would‚Äôve been frisking up under his cuffs where you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see.&&Infinity War had that problem. In the first scene with Tom Holland and RDJ on the alien ship, Tom's hair goes from being carefully slicked back to all fluffy at the front. RDJ's hair also changes. It bugs me especially because you'd think such a high profile movie would put more  attention to those little continuity details.&&But who watches the watchwatchmen?&&So it would be more of a Macinwatch&&> Gary Hart's 1988 presidential run

It's amazing. &&Yeah, and a [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiner_(film)) was being made about his attemped ""comeback"" after he resigned from congress, [only for him to AGAIN crash and burn as the doc was filming because it was revealed that he never actually stopped texting people inappropriately](#spoiler).

I haven't seen it, but I've heard a lot of interviews with the documentary producers about how awkward and tense it was to be around the campaign (and Weiner's wife) as they were scrambling to keep it together. 

edit: I added a spoiler tag just in case someone wants to see it and doesn't know what happened during that campaign.&&The crazy thing about weiner is that he showed us a sociopathic side of his personality when initially denying and attacking critics.    There was a moment when he was campaigning and called some old voter that questioned him ‚Äúgrandpa‚Äù.  &&\> I completely forgot Weiner. He is just the wurst.

FTFY&&Yeah, but he was elected *to congress* after his scandal, and despite the GOP pulling their endorsement of him after ""April 17, 2013... in the wake of revelations that Jenny Sanford had filed a trespassing complaint... [She] caught her former husband sneaking out of her home in Sullivan's Island, using his cellphone as a flashlight."" And Mark Sanford was re-elected to his congressional seat in 2014, unopposed. 

 So I think this one doesn't count as an affair destroying his credibility. 

[Note: Yes, he did go through impeachment proceedings in 2009 after the initial fallout from the affair, but, he didn't leave the gubernatorial office.

Who goes hiking on the Appalachian trail without telling anyone &&Yes he ran with John Kerry. But the news about the affair didnt break until the election was already over.&&Either VP or speculation he might be Obama's Attorney General. Edwards' presidential campaign was over but by no means was his political career over at that point. Both Hillary and Obama lobbied hard for his endorsement a couple months before the story broke. &&ol‚Äô billy bitch tits&&Nah dude, he‚Äôs been saying for years how he‚Äôs basically a whore and will take just about any acting gig. &&His bit in ‚ÄúThe Racial Draft‚Äù was great &&From what I've read, WB had the choice of either paying $20 million to compensate for the 3 month delay on MI or deal with the stache.

They dealt with the stache with the consequences we all know but since Cruise had an injury during a stunt, the movie got a 3 month delay anyway. Not quite the FU you suggest but still something albeit accidental.&&Are you saying you think the Warner brothers broke Tom Cruise‚Äôs leg?! &&Sure he looked badass in that scene but I'd just like to point out that both of these super agents were getting their asses kicked all the way in by that one dude while fighting 2v1.&&It's more like the movie and Archer were working from the same sources, including the [Man from UNCLE show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057765/?ref_=nv_sr_4).&&Such a good film. I‚Äôm sad it won‚Äôt get a sequel.&&UNCLE was so well done. He was great. &&Since seeing him do a great job in that movie, I've wanted him to play Archer in a live action film.  Dubbed over by /u/failurejon, of course.&&If you H Jon Benjaminned his voice he'd be the perfect Archer in a live-action movie. All the rest of them pretty much look like their characters anyway. &&I wish he had better scripts to work with, or better direction. We already know he's a good actor and he definitely looks the part, so why is his Superman so meh?&&That picture was a reference to [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/207/210/b22.jpg).&&This sounds way creepier now than just a simple watch.&&Don't you have to charge them like every 18 hours or something?

Even if they have BG Costumers helping that day, ultimately the costume set supervisor is the head of department on set!! (if designer or assistant designer is not on set. Still, the set supervisor is in charge of costume continuity) 

They definitely did not pay attention enough. (EDIT: or props department actually approved it. Watches are props department. We still pay attention to the continuity of watches, backpacks, purses, etc as costume department even if those are prop departments responsibility.) 

They need to pay attention to the shot once they are rolling and if something needs to be adjusted, once they cut, they can remove the watch. Hopefully that watch was only in this one take and they probably redid the scene a few times from the same and then different angles AND the costume set supervisor stepped in to tell the guy to take off the watch. &&You'd be surprised how much slips thru even on big sets.

......and I'm just CHECKIN' IN ON YUH!&&It's the Thursday Afternoon Just Before Friday Monday Morning Podcast.

...he's just checking in on ya! &&Ehhhh go fuck yourself, I‚Äôll see ya Thursday. &&He sent pics of himself with his kid in the picture to a 15 year old he wanted to fuck&&Right. I was just answering the other guys question.&&In short: Superman wrapped filming for Justice League, grew stache to play character in MI. During shooting of MI, Justice League changed director and new director wanted to shoot new scenes/re-shoot existing scenes. MI movie studio says ""OK, but don't change his look unless you want to pay us for the delays"", WB agrees, CGI's out Superman's stash at a ridiculous cost ($25M is rumored) and debatable quality.

Superman goes back to MI shooting as agreed, MI delayed anyway because Tom Xenu Cruise broke his foot in a stunt.&&Henry Cavill finished filming his scenes as Superman for Justice League, where he is clean-shaven. He then started work for his role in Mission Impossible: Fallout, where his character was to have a mustache and facial hair. 

Troubles arose with the Justice League production, with Zack Snyder having to leave partway due to a death in the family and Joss Whedon taking over. This involved rewrites and reshoots and they wanted Cavill back to shoot more Superman footage. But he was already in the middle of filming MI and had grown the facial hair.

Cavill was allowed to do the reshoots for Justice League, but since the MI producers still needed him with the mustache for their film, he was not allowed to shave. WB tried to make a deal that Paramount delay the MI filming so that he could shave, reshoot his Justice League scenes, and then grow his mustache back, but Paramount declined the money and didn't want to adjust their schedule. So WB did more Superman scenes with Cavill, who was still with his facial hair, and then edited out the hair with CGI in post-production. The end result is that you can see some pretty funny looking shots of Henry Cavill in the final cut of Justice League, one of many things that critics point to in the flaws of the movie.

Incidentally, Mission Impossible did end up having a filming delay anyway as Tom Cruise broke his ankle doing a stunt and needed time to heal.&&Cavill needed a moustache for his role in M:I. He didn't need one for Justice League. Justice League needed reshoots after he'd started growing his 'stache.&&Didn‚Äôt perform as well as expected I guess, and studios aren‚Äôt in it for much other than the box office are they.&&""How *does* it feel?""

Pray I don't alter it further.""&&This is kind of a ""fuck you"" to Disney as they are sure to pull all **Fox** content from AT&T platforms.

People don't realize one of the biggest losers in the Fox deal was HBO which gets a huge chunk of it's films from Fox (this week's big Saturday premier is in fact ***Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri***). So it's ironic that everyone thought Netflix was what HBO had to fear when it just got the mother of all sucker-punches from Disney. 

Which is why the AT&T honcho gave HBO the mandate to make more content, they are about to lose probably 1/3 of their films as the deals with Fox expire. &&It's a good thing anyone who is a fan of the series already owns the original trilogy in some capacity.&&So they get the movie rights back in just over 5 years?

AT&T has a $237Billion market cap, compared to Disney's $170Billion.

So no, Disney isn't going to be buying AT&T to get the streaming rights back for Star Wars.&&Honestly, if you have not seen Star Wars or even if you have just been born in the last handful of years and are finding yourselves pop-culturally displaced and neglected, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre never going to be seen if they aren‚Äôt on a streaming service. In fact, we could all probably do well to cool off on the Star Wars force-feeding (pun may as well be intended) tube these days, the owner of the IP would do well to prevent any further over saturation. 

A few years wait for the originals to be all there on streaming services is probably just okay in the big picture. I remember when we just had one singular pre-SE vhs tape to last an entire childhood, and it did, even had to rewind the tape manually at one point there toward the end. Man, I loved that look of a lovingly worn vhs tape, looks like, memories.

HBO needs to step their game up, they can't survive on GOT and Westworld forever.

Plus a lot of their classic shows are available on prime now (The Sopranos, The Wire, Entourage, Big Love etc) which I think was a bad move on their part. Keep your IP dagnabit!

edit: I have been informed there should be no ""The"" preceding ""Entourage""&&Disney, AT&T, Amazon and probably a few others are fighting to get their streaming services up first and be better. 

Netflix has a slot, no question. They are smart in creating so much original content. They are building a foundation that does not rely on Disney, Fox, WB, Universal, etc so they are not dependent on them. If they are not stupid they can see that they are trying to replace them, so they need to stand on their own. 

Amazon has a hell of a head start on many but its content is small in volume. The quality is not there and its not coming out with nearly enough original content. This will weaken it in the long run. It has money and potential, but not being utilized. 

Verison/ATT&T are the real villain here. They have probably the most money available and a lot at stake. The president they could set if they win big would be awful. 

Disney with FOX is a solid hope. If they follow the no commercial policy of Netflix, and don't wuss out and put 80-100% of their content on streaming they could wack the hell out of Netflix and the others. 

I'm banking on Netflix and Disney being long term leaders moving forward, with amazon and HBO poking around but not able to compete on the same scale. &&Why are informative comments like this at the bottom yet memes skyrocket to the top&&Yeah, it's not that movies are unavailable.

It's like every journalist on this topic has forgotten that Disney's plan to ""make"" a streaming service doesn't have to mean adding one more player to the already crowded market.

I'm all about new cuts of the movies of we're also getting home video releases of the original unaltered (pre-Special Editions) versions.&&> What about the theatrical cut? Disney could just say that they are different movies. 

Doesn't work that way. This is why the Special Editions were playing on TV (TBS in fact IIRC) less than a year after they were released. Otherwise, studios could just cram extra scenes in a movie and sell them to someone else even though they gave ""exclusive rights"" to another party. &&I doubt it.

They have a massive library they could put on a streaming service, and they will keep churning out material for the foreseeable future. I expect them to be a major player in the future.&&A New Hope:

Obi-Wan, played by Ewan McGregor  joins Luke to destroy the death star, same as the original.

When the heroes are trying to escape, Vader strikes down Luke instead of Obi-Wan.

Obi Wan looks on in horror, and Vader feels through the Force that he killed his son. He stares at Obi-Wan as the door to the millennium falcon closes...somehow through his mask he is pleading for his old master to save him. 

At Yavin IV, Obi-Wan meditates while the rebellion plans to destroy the death star. We see Vader also meditating.

During the Battle of Yavin, Obi-Wan and Vader find each other. Vader is the superior pilot, and it's clear the only reason he hasn't killed Obi-Wan is because of the conversation they're having. Vader is trying to justify his choices, but Obi-Wan will not let him. 

Han swoops in and lands a hit on a distracted Vader, who goes tumbling down towards a moon. 

With his death imminent, he removes his mask and asks Obi-Wan to forgive him. Obi-Wan chases after him and using the Force, slows Vader's ship down enough so he survives. 

Wedge Antilles destroys the death star, while Obi-Wan radios Leia to bring Han and come to him.

He tells Leia the truth about her father, and  they rush him to a bacta tank. Obi-Wan meditates nearby while Vader heals, and the leaders of the rebellion recount the heroics of Anakin Skywalker. Leia demands they execute him, and convinces the other rebel leaders to do so.

Having rejected the Dark Side, Anakin no longer needs the suit. 

His robotic legs and right arm work well enough that Obi-Wan is able to sneak him onboard the Millennium Falcon. 

Wsee a healed/repaired Anakin standing along side Obi-Wan, holding a lightsaber in his hand.

A blue blade emerges and the first movie ends.

Now here is the mind blower. Infinity War Part 2 is already filmed. Sure, maybe they have some reshoots and post work to do but it is essentially paid for. Maybe another $100 million of work being generous and then say $300 million for marketing ect. 

Everyone who watched IW1 in the theatre will see IW2, then you get everyone who sees IW1 at home so let's say it makes another 2 billion. That means $1.6 billion in pure profit.

The bloody show is almost 20 years old.&&Don't forget they don't get all of that $2 billion, domestically, around 50% goes to the theaters (with provisos) and internationally it varies depending on the country. Still makes a huge profit, just not quite *that* huge from the box office alone. Ancillaries? Well, that's another (very profitable) story.&&Infinity War and Avengers 4's combined production budget was rumored to be [$1 billion](https://www.slashfilm.com/avengers-infinity-war-budget/). Perhaps it didn't cost quite that much, but it's likely that it cost at least $600 million in production costs combined - $300 million per movie. And that'd just be the production budget. The marketing budget for each movie has to be at least upwards of $200 million, bringing the total production + marketing budget for this movie to, at least, an estimated $1 billion - if not more. For the purposes of this calculation, we'll use $1 billion.

Infinity War is likely done at the box office, leaving its domestic gross at around $680 million, the overseas minus China gross at $1.006 billion, and China gross at $360 million. Domestic usually nets the studio 50%-60% of the gross, but for an event film like Infinity War, it's possible Disney negotiated a higher rate, so we'll say 55% as a good average. International is generally 40%, except for China at 25%.

The breakdown:

* Domestic: $680 million -> $340 million

* Overseas minus China: $1.006 billion -> $503 million

* China: $360 million -> $90 million

This leaves Marvel Studios with a take of ~$933 million. If we use the assumed production + marketing cost from earlier - $500 million per movie - then Marvel Studios pockets $433 million. That's a lot of profit. However, the other $500 million in costs for Avengers 4 still exists, and if A4 lands close to Infinity War, then the profit for Avengers 4 will land close to Infinity War's profit.

It's likely that IW + A4 will land around $900 million to $1 billion in profit, which is a huge amount. For reference, The Force Awakens made around [$780 million](https://deadline.com/2016/03/star-wars-the-force-awakens-movie-profit-2015-lucasfilm-disney-1201726142/) in profit, buoyed largely by its high domestic gross and low China percentage, whereas Infinity War made about $250 million less domestically and that same amount more in China.

By all measures, IW + A4 will be a double home run for Marvel Studios and Disney.&&>  Let's just call it an even $700 million. At the box office it made 2 billion meaning they made $1.3 Billion in profit on one movie.

Though I'm watching Monday Night War right now and I'm really pretty impressed with how much credit they give Bischoff/WCW. For a WWE production it's a little less biased than I expected, and they still focus a bit too much on ""Vince vs. Turner"", when like you said, it was definitely ""Vince vs. Bischoff"". Problem is, I don't think Vince ever (even to this day) realized that he wasn't fighting Turner, he was fighting Bischoff, and since WCW went under and WWF came out on top, and gets to write the narrative, it's always ""Lil' ol' Vince vs. Big Bad Billionaire"". &&Its treason then&&[deleted]&&Maybe for the first one, I can't imagine the outrage would be a draw for three films.&&Warwick Davis was 3 different characters in 3 different Star Wars movies.

I mean Avatar came out in 2009, Cameron announced 4 sequels as soon as it was a success but its been 10 years and we haven't heard much (and he hasn't done anything else) so why did they wait till 2017 to start filming?

Also since it took 10 years to make the first sequel I don't see how the other 3 will come out within 5 years of that sequel.

They re-release all of their films every 10 years or so, in fact they've been doing this since like the 1940's when they would do theatrical re-releases.  They never said they would go into the vault forever, they go into the vault for approximately 10 years.  They do this for a few reasons - 1) to keep films fresh for new generations, 2) to limit their shelf presence at retail (no store is going to stock ""Oliver and Company"" if they can stock all the classics at once), and 3) to make money, obviously, when the films come back out again in a new format and with new bonus features after being unavailable for 10 years.&&And the cinematography adopts a cooler color palette as time goes on, so that probably helps a lot too.&&With all the flying brooms, I think of them around spring cleaning time.&&This video is what happens when you find a stranger in the alps. &&They cut off the Lebowski one too early, after finding a stranger in the alps, he says ""this is what happens when you feed a stranger scrambled eggs!""&&TV censorship is weird.

It caused a wave of depression across the world as people despaired they would never go to a place as beautiful as Pandora.  The actual story and characters of Avatar were generic and universal so that general audiences could follow them enough to get invested in the fantasy world.

I don't think the date of release matters at all for an Avatar sequel, as long as it continues the strengths of the original.  The characters don't need to return, the plot can pick up somewhere else with a different tribe, none of that matters to the movie's success.

* Sandra Bullock: $169 million

* Angelina Jolie: $164 million

* Julia Roberts: $120 million

* Scarlett Johansson: $118 million

* Cameron Diaz: $113 million

* Kristen Stewart: $112.5 million

* Reese Witherspoon: $91.5 million

* Melissa McCarthy: $86 million
&&Imagine having 40 million dollars &&The pay could go higher if she got more roles, theoretically. &&Collin Jost never has to work again&&To give it some context, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was the highest paid actor, raking in $128 mil. &&Still doesn‚Äôt make as much as Judge Judy&&The pay likely included filming both Avengers 3 and 4. As one of the original Avengers, and as much money as those movies make, it wouldn't be unreasonable to pay her $10-$20 million per movie. They pay RDJ $75 million per movie.

She also did three other movies in that stretch (Ghost in the Shell, Rough Night, Isle of Dogs.).

This shouldn't be that surprising.

I do find it interesting that when she did Lost in Translation, people thought she was one of the best actresses out there. Now that she is doing Marvel movies, she is a no-talent hack.&&I can't believe people think Scarlett's not talented because she does paycheck action movies. Like you haven't seen Match Point?

Not bad. Rest of the top 5:

* Angelina Jolie (No. 2; $28 million)

* Jennifer Lawrence (No. 4; $? million)
* Reese Witherspoon (No. 5; $16.5 million)

I'm a big fan of Scarlett, but the movies she stars in don't make nearly as much money as Dwayne Johnson's, and the ones that do (MCU movies, Jungle Book) didn't make the money because of her.&&From 2017 through 2018, The Rock's movies generated $3.1 billion and Johansson 's films generated $2.3 billion and that's including 2 billion from Infinity War.&&Pretty crazy he went from traveling/working 300 days out of a year, making a couple mil to $128mil. &&Who is the next highest paid actor? Maybe The Rock's just a complete anomaly, especially since (as other people have mentioned) he does tons and tons of projects every year.

Edit: I don't think the source article says, but it does mention something else that I found interesting:

> Currently, female characters fill only 28.7% of all speaking roles in film, according to a 2016 study.

To me, that's a much more concerning metric than directly comparing salaries.

Anyways, maybe you weren't trying to imply anything sexist by giving that context. I mean, if we were talking about Oscar winners or something, it'd be completely natural to ask who won Best Actor right after someone says who won Best Actress.

Crabs in a bucket. Put someone at the top, and no matter their talent or strength of character, someone at the bottom will send blind hatred that person's way purely on the basis that they're succeeding and the hater is not.

Or personally, how I dislike Beyonc√©: I know she's good and I don't mind her music, but her fans drive me bonkers and I have to try to stop myself from judging her based on them. I guess if people think Johansson is a good but not great (or at least not worthy of being the highest-paid actress), they might start complaining, and here on reddit complaining can quickly evolve into a lynch mob. Plus, some people think she's type-casted herself (I'm not even going to argue if that's true or not) and sometimes you start to blend the actress with her characters, so if you really dislike what kind of characters she plays you might start to dislike her in general.&&i don't hate her, but to be fair shes been involved in two pretty controversial castings recently, accusations of white washing ghost in a shell and the whole trans one.

I don't think either warranted the outcry they got, but if you're looking for a reason some might hate her currently, factor in the irrational nature of people, look at what shes been involved in and expect people to hate.&&Nephew..&&Thanks for signing up for Judge Judy Facts!

Also it's all civil suits, no criminal cases, and the participants actually get paid to appear, so even the loser often makes money in the end. 

As for why she makes so much, I think that American daytime TV gets more viewership than most people think and it has a solid demographic. Moreover, it's dominated by familiar formats and faces and low budget production.

I think they get likr $4-7 million a movie and their contracts are up after this next one... so they will likely be leaving but if they sign again it could mean BIG money (they were on like 7 film contracts I think).

That's what happened with RDJ- he signed a small contract for Iron Man but it got him back in the mainstream, then he signed a larger contract for more movies but it ended... but they know he is a huge draw and carries some of the film's so they are willing to pay him $40 million to come back.&&> and they can‚Äôt afford to pay every actor in them top dollar

I was quite surprised when I read the headline to this article. Johansson was big when the first and second Avengers movies came out but now I see her as an actress that barely tries in her roles.

And then her salary as a projection of that assessment. &&Well yeah, I don't think you're ever going to make it to $200 million, so that life isn't going to be yours.

I don't feel like doing more but yeah I think even saying 20th is generous.&&Wait, was she in Infinity War?&&Yeah, almost every movie he did this year he was the main draw. I would say that wasn't the case for F&F but everything else was driven mostly by his presence. Rampage would have been a huge fucking failure if he wasn't the star of it.

Meanwhile, I don't think Scarlett Johansson has *ever* been the reason to see a movie. Lucy, I guess, for those who cared about it. She certainly isn't a big draw in the MCU films - the same could be said about most of the characters. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye for example - would anybody actually care if he wasn't there?&&Roseanne?&&[deleted]&&Her mom wouldn't have gone to the movie theater&&At least the box office generated by the ScarJo fan club.&&Warpath?

KA-BLAMM&&It was also hard to fit much in for any individual actor/actress in the movie. Almost every superhero had minimal time.

&&What are you basing that on? I think she's done a pretty good job in most things she's been in except Avengers, and you can hardly blame her there. Black Widow is a shit role and the writers don't give her anything to work with.&&Everything stays the exact same we don‚Äôt have the budget for wardrobe changes.&&They wouldn't even need Hulk if they got the Rock &&Yeah this is a weird comment. I agree Johansson is almost pointless in the Marvel movies but Jodie Foster was the main character in Silence of the Lambs. I think most people would be surprised how little Anthony Hopkins is actually in the movie... He's probably on screen for less than 10 minutes total.&&Me every time I faked sick to stay home from school from 1999-2012 &&I mean a lot of houswives love her and it doesn't seem like she always in doctors offices.

It kinda makes sense Judge Judy is the sole star (Besides the bailiff)  of a hugely popular show that probably costs very little to make.  whatever the difference between her and her copycats is  pretty much what she can demand &&He is 2nd only to Feige for the success of the MCU. To have one actor be such a perfect choice for a role, to have that character's first film be such a great film (thank you favreau), to have that actor continue to agree to be in 8 films (9 if you consider infinity war 2 different movies), to have that actor be an advocate and sponsor for the entire universe. 

Imagine what MCU would be if Downey fucked up and got back into drugs in 2010. Or if he said he was done after the first Avengers. Or if he got into some beef and started to trash Marvel in 2013. Or if he said ""No"" to Civil War or Spiderman. Or if he wanted out of the MCU entirely at any point in the last 10 years.

Marvel struck gold that they were able to milk RDJ for all his worth for a decade. Most big time actors wouldn't commit to this. I don't mean to lessen the commitment of Evans, Johansenn, Hemsworth, Renner, or Ruffalo. 

But man would this Universe be totally different if RDJ wasn't 100% commited and on-board with Feige's strategy. And unless IW4 somehow shits the bed (and at this point even if it is critically ""meh"" it is guaranteed to financially a juggernaut"") it will always be remembered as one of the biggest accomplishments in film in decades, possibly of the century.

Black Widow does actually have some powers in the comics. She's basically a Russian, female version of Cap, though toned down considerably. She ages slower, has resistance to disease and stuff, heals faster than most people, and she has enhanced human strength and agility.

I'm really surprised that they haven't covered any of this in the MCU. &&which i thought that whole control the hulk thing was a complete eye-roll inducing move anyway. &&Are you talking about how the Hulk is less of a raging maniac now? Because that's different than Banner having more control, they're not quite the same person. Banner has far less control now than during the first Avengers, he could at least somewhat switch to hulk form back then, now he doesn't even have that.&&They‚Äôre talking about now, not the past.  Under the Skin and Her came out FIVE years ago.  Since then she has literally exclusively been in dumb blockbusters, except for Isle of Dogs.&&Stays the same as in he wears clothes that were made for scarjo?  If so, sign me up for a daily viewing of that movie.&&>I think most people would be surprised how little Anthony Hopkins is actually in the movie.

Absolutely agree with you there. He was in the movie for just under 16 minutes I think. But he had such a bone-chilling performance that it sticks with you more strongly.&&> to have that actor be an advocate and sponsor for the entire universe.

In my uneducated opinion, this factor is huge. How many people on here talk about how Downey just seems like Stark irl? It's almost not fair to calculate his pay based on screen time, because then we overlook just how much of his normal life is spent ""playing"" a character and promoting the franchise.&&As much as I love all the MCU movies and characters, Tony Stark still feels like the central hub holding it all together.  He's just perfect.  Has there been anything said about him planning to leave the franchise any time soon?  He's been at it for 10 years, and I wonder if RDJ would be considering moving on.  I'd be so bummed if he did because even though there could still be great MCU movies in the future, I'd feel like a little something was missing.&&It was Jon Faverau who practically made Iron Man. He hustled with Feige to get it greenlighted. Feige and RDJ has said this without Jon the MCU wouldn't exist. This is why he has a position in marvel studio. He is Sonny in the films. Tony driver and right hand man.&&Are you kidding me? You're joking right? Please tell me you're pulling a fast one?&&It's on TBS, Nick, Paramount Network, and Netflix. I bet they get at least $100-200M per deal, probably a lot more for Netflix. And that's just in the US. I'm sure it plays all over the world. &&Yeah, and on a similar note, Seinfeld generates somewhere close to $2 billion off syndication, which is why Jerry Seinfeld is the richest actor in the world despite doing only Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.&&These Forbes lists are always guesswork bullshit, and just looking Courtney Cox has not been in anything since 2016. Maybe you have to be ""active"" to be considered. 

But also from reading the article, sounds like they are not considering residuals. That's all new revenue from endorsements it seems like. &&If neither of you have watched, you're both spot on.&&Best job ever rly.

Larry David is swimming in *Seinfeld* money also, and was never a cast member.  

I'm not making a judgement on who should get what cut of whatever, but you can't compare apples to oranges.  &&How many cheeses do you get sent and what is the most exotic you've received?&&Found Chandler. &&She's been in a lot of movies and she's a big draw for a lot of people. A lot of the women on this list get big paychecks for movies that are more targeted at female audiences... Aniston is one of the ones who does a lot of work targeted at both men and women. Plus she's just been in a lot.

She's been in 14 movies in the 2010s. $15 million for a star of her calibre is not crazy.&&It's insane to me that her and Nicole Richie are sisters-in-law now.&&In a weird way I kind of enjoyed AC. Mostly because the setting looked cool. Actually that‚Äôs a terrible thing to highlight lol&&At the same time acting can be fickle as a career. You can be making movies, have a flop or two and then just disappear and not get good work. So there's incentive to make as much as possible *guaranteed* that you can live off of for life if the acting thing fizzles out. 

Of course there comes a point where once you have a good amount already banked, yeah you can take a bit more of a gamble going for percentage of revenue. &&Well, at one point Jane Foster becomes the new Thor and the original Thor: The Worthy becomes The Unworthy Thor.

It was an interesting choice to show that you still can't trust Black Widow. Her romance with Banner may only be for manipulation, a terrible thing for the 'greater good' - which is something the Avengers constantly deal with. 

E.g. when Black Widow is complicit with launching Hulk into space.  &&Yeah but saying he deserves the entirety of the credit is a bit of a stretch. People like interesting villains. You can say Hopkins stole the movie but he isn‚Äôt the whole movie. That would be like saying Heath ledger was the entirety of the Dark Knight or Vader was The entirety of The Empire Strikes back &&Iirc, he's said in an interview that when he first became Iron Man, he saw himself and Tony as basically the same person, but later he learned to separate his own personality and the character's.&&Depends if they kill him in avengers 4.

I'd be okay with killing them off to be honest, as long as they both get a death their character deserves. Iron-Man needs a death that exemplifies his character development over the past 10 years. He started off as a selfish weapons developer with little accountability and ended up as one of the world's greatest heroes. Whenever he made a mistake, he tried his best to find his issue and fix it. For Cap, I hope they give him time to figure out his mess with Tony.

(Holy shit)

I don't want either of them to call it quits any time soon. But if that happens I honestly can't see Spiderman, at least in his current incarnation as a kid still learning the ropes, taking the lead. I like Holland in the role but he's not strong enough yet to really hold his own in a leadership role.

I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Chadwick fucking Boseman himself.

I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Chadwick, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Chadwick put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.
&&Holy fuck the pseuds in this thread&&Okay, where are all the fanboys who complained about Disney supposedly pushing ""A Wrinkle in Time"" over $100 million? You won't hear a beep out of them.&&Culture has an impact on movie reception. Movies from a few decades back couldn't get made today. I don't see anything wrong with this. That's just society.

Black Panther was good, not great. But it's the first comic book movie with a titular, black main character since Blade IIRC. Not to mention the majority of the cast were all black

AND it didn't really put down white people. There were jokes at Martin Freeman's expense, but they were done with a good nature at least. 

To me as a black man, the movie seemed aimed at (particularly black, but can apply to other races) people who strike it big (or just get lucky) and abandon those like them. It was about having empathy for the plight of others less fortunate. 

It was about as wholesome and meaningful as the movie could have been, and I think a lot of people really appreciated that (as the Box Office seems to show).

If anyone else wanted to make over a billion at the box office and get a lot of praise, all they had to do was make the same sort of movie.

But nope.

Took Coogler to do it, 20 years after Blade. And if it takes another 20 years for another one of these movies, it'll smash through records like this one.

There's an starving audience for these types of movies and we're not being served often enough. So when something finally comes around, we overeat.&&*sorts by controversial*&&Don't forget it set the record for biggest Monday in history &&I remember when reddit said it‚Äôll do just ‚Äúok‚Äù.

So many people complained about how a masterpiece of action cinema could have been bested by ""some stupid movie about singing girls or something.""

And of course it's always the movies with a target demo outside of the typical reddit demo. Stuff like Mamma Mia 2 or Uncle Drew. Redditors just don't know how to handle BO analysis about these movies outside of gut feeling, because they know so little about them.&&I saw it opening night. I went with a small group that is really into the MCU. But I sat on the edge of my group, so the people to my left were strangers. They were an old white couple. We didn't speak before the movie but I got the vibe that this wasn't their normal choice of cinema. As the credits started to roll, they leaned over to me and started asking questions about the other movies. ""Are the rest of them \*this\* good? Where should we start? How does this compare?""

There is so much that can be said about the scene alone.

All in all, maybe not the best Marvel movie.

That's why r/movies shits on BP. We'll get a lot more films like it now&&You could say the same thing about Avatar, Avengers, and Jurassic World. It pretty much boils down to marketing and hype.

That's the only reason I can explain why it did better than many other movies that I'd say had a better narrative and more interesting characters.

Black Panther is not a particularly interesting character.  Wakanda has the potential to be pretty interesting but they don't fucking *do* anything with it - it's just window dressing to explain how Black Panther gets his superpowers and why they're able to use what's effectively magic.  It's one thing to just go ""okay, vibranium is a rare, very dense metal with some interesting properties"" when it's used for Cap's shield etc, but when you're going ""I'm going to put this metal ball in a guy and it'll heal his severed spinal cord *because vibranium!*"", you need to do some fucking explaining.

How did the Wakandans-to-be even mine and refine the vibranium in the first place?  They made it sound like the meteor hit a very long time ago, like during the bronze age at the latest... how are they mining and refining vibranium with primitive tools and *very* limited metallurgy knowledge?  Did the vibranium also give them magical knowledge on how to refine it?

What does a Wakandan's daily life look like?  What's their *actual* system of governance beyond the ""king and a stereotypical representative of major African cultures past and present"" government?  What's their educational system like?  What's their healthcare look like, since vibranium appears to be outright magical?

There are so many unanswered questions and frankly Wakanda was the only interesting thing about Black Panther.  The only reason I can see Black Panther being so much more successful than arguably superior Marvel movies is *because* it features a black hero, an almost entirely black cast (any non-black characters are bit roles and secondary to the black protagonists, in a reversal of usual Hollywood setups) and ham-fistedly talks about issues the black community has faced and continues to face.

Did you ever stop and think that maybe ""It DiD gOod cAUse mUh ViRTue SiGNallInG & WHite GUilt"" is a common expression because it's difficult to provide any other explanation for why it did so much better than other Marvel movies despite not having a narrative or acting that's substantially better or even *different* from other Marvel movies?&&Why change?

I heard my friend tell this story a few times and he's not the kind of dude that lies. Now all of a sudden a few years later I see this meme on reddit.

&&I remember someone posting this about NDT last year and trying to push it off as fact lol.&&I think that's what Disney would prefer at this point&&With good reason, I think. I love the book.

Anyways, my only problem is that they speak incredibly slow which makes sense for the sake of maintaining clarity for viewers. But trust me, most Africans I knew growing up have much thicker accents. Makes sense since Wakanda is isolationist. Which imo also explains the spears and tribalism. It's an important part of Africa's history.

You get the 2nd run movies and you show like Bright or Game of Thrones. Charge a buck, sodas a buck, not the massive ones, just like a medium size. And a medium popcorn for like 2 bucks.

Basically Redbox for theaters so you can see stuff on the big screen. But I am sure everyone wants their cut and would not make it feasible.&&We have several second run theaters in my town. Most have tickets that are $3-4, but one charges $1 for a movie $2 for a 3D movie, and has free movies on Wednesday (usually B horror movies).

They're just leveraging the fact they have a movie people want to see.&&It‚Äôs called releasing a movie they know will be incredibly popular. The only way Disney has leverage over theaters to pull off that sort of thing is when they‚Äôre releasing a hugely anticipated movie. Ie they‚Äôre about to make a lot of consumers very happy.

In the event that stops happening, Disney loses their leverage. And it‚Äôs very easy for a studio to become irrelevant.

That‚Äôs a bummer because I thought Oprah would crush it. The ending really fell flat to me. The third act was changed significantly in a way that changed the final conflict and in turn the main characters emotional journeys. &&How bad could it be?

If you don't understand why Hulk is a giant green dude who can shrink into a small nerdy scientist don't see it.&&I have mixed opinions on this. Ragnarok is definitely by far the best Thor movie and also one of the funniest of all the Marvel movies, but a lot of what I found enjoyable did build upon at least having some familiarity with The Avengers and Thor. I think you‚Äôd still find it amusing, but you would probably enjoy it most if you had seen at least those two films first. &&Yeah, it is pretty self contained, if you know who Thor/Loki/Hulk are, you should be totally fine understanding the story. There are some jokes that are kinda of a callback, but isn't anything that you can pick up watching the movie.&&Oof, you're missing out.  Some of them are genuinely excellent movies - Iron Man 1, Avengers 1, Guardians of the Galaxy (it was the funniest one before Ragnarok came out - ~~Tim~~James Gunn is awesome) and Captain America 2 (Winter Soldier) are all amazing movies.

\* edit: Tim Gunn is the guy from Project Runway and the voice of Bailiwick on Sofia the First.&&Very Taika presence, he even lends his voice and humor to a character which in itself is golden.

Just nuts how flawless the movie looks for 99% of it.&&my biggest complaint regarding the CGI was *SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN INFINITY WAR LOOK AWAY STOP READING LALALALALAL*

[when they fight Thanos on Titan and he uses the power stone as like a ""whiplash"" and trips up Drax and the other two heros there (I think nebula and spiderman or starlord)] (#spoiler).

While Michael B Jordan did a pretty good job with what he was given, the character arc was extremely rushed and just became plain stupid towards the end with his completely absurd plan.  

[I feel like the pacing of the entire movie was off, mainly because they spent half the movie chasing Andy Serkis' character. When we finally get to what's supposed to be the focus of the movie it all has to play out in an incredibly rushed fashion with Killmonger taking over the kingdom, disposing of the Black Panther and then getting into his silly plan of taking over the world all within a day or two.  
If all of that had taken up the majority of the movie and taken months or possibly even years in movie-time, it would have seemed a lot more plausible and less silly.  
I honestly think they could have fixed most of the issues with the movie by heavily reducing the first ""pre-Wakanda"" portion of the movie and extended the part with Killmonger coming to Wakanda. It feels like there's almost no time to flesh out the characters in the latter part of the movie and everything happens too quickly and there's no time to linger on anything, every little thing is there to move the story along and most of the characters are making extremely drastic and unbelievable actions with almost no hesitation because the story dictates it, rather than because it seems like something they would actually do.](#spoiler)

There are a ton of nitpicky things I can think of, but won't really get into. Like you said there are plenty of other mediocre blockbusters that make tons of money, but usually they aren't showered in as much praise as this movie was.  

All in all it was a pretty ordinary Hollywood action movie, and I completely agree that me and others are being more harsh on the movie than we probably normally would be, but I think it's pretty cheap to just instinctively call the racist card because we're pointing out that the movie really isn't as fantastic as it was initially made out to be.&&Well how about this. Explain why you think it's a good movie and not overrated?

I saw it once, didn't feel like seeing it again which is not my norm for marvel movies. Nothing stands out much. Black Panther was much better in Civil War. That left me wanting more. And I still vividly remember the chase sequence and his badass triple kick. Like the whole theater had a ""...oh shit"" under their breah.

Besides the terrible cgi rhinos and the cool wheel shred that was in every commercial, not a lot stands out. I get the importance and impact a predominantly Black cast blockbuster has culturally/socially. That's a watershed moment.

But ultimately it's down there with Thor 2 and Hulk as far as Marvel movies go. Imo.&&Yes, however, there‚Äôs still a ton of praise in this thread and all of the BP threads.&&Yep, which makes it all the stranger when one of them decides to be judgemental and kind of racist.&&Because franchises that operate in multiple states streamline almost everything about their operations. So it's easier to provide it even in places where it's not actually required by law. 

The person you're replying to is just splitting hairs. You'd be hard pressed to find a restaurant, movie theater, bar, etc anywhere in the US that doesn't provide free tap water on request. Even among non-franchises. If the franchises do it, the mom and pop diner down the street is going to as well because at that point it's just expected and has a negligible impact on operating costs.&&Imagine charging someone for a cup of water though.

Personally, I like it because Killmonger is a compelling villain with an understandable goal (if a flawed method of achieving it). The music, costumes, and sets are all interesting and relatively unique in the genre. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of a lot of be fight scenes, especially the last one between Black Panther and Killmonger, but other than that I thought it was great. Certainly better than most of the marvel movies where the villain just wants to destroy/rule the world/galaxy for either petty or insane reasons. 

What don‚Äôt you like about it?&&I honestly felt like people were scared to say it wasn‚Äôt great at release. Same with Wonder Woman. I saw critics online dancing around and holding up mundane parts of the films to base an inflated score on. &&The plot was streamlined and understandable and those unfamiliar with the comic Black Panther lore (like myself) were still able to enjoy the movie and be immersed into its story. The protagonist himself was rather shallow and not great at emotional expression but fun to watch and portrayed a very mature character. Plus TDE produced the movie's soundtrack which made for some memorable scenes and popular radio hits. 

I haven't had that much fun watching a Marvel movie since Doctor Strange. IMO the Avenger movies besides IW, Ragnorak, the Captain America movies, and others didn't hold a candle to Black Panther. &&There are loads of people that explain why they like it.

It was fun to watch, had some decent action sequences and the soundtrack was solid.

EDIT the term market share is technically correct but people often misinterpret it to mean amount of movie productions. Box office Revenue is much clearer &&Ehh that isn't the reason why they dominate and not really something related to Disney. 

Verizon and Comcast dominate due to the monopoly they have. Usually if you are trying to find TV and/or internet for your home, you have 1-2 choices unless you have a public/city provider. Comcast is usually a lot of people's only choice and thus they have a monopoly. 

Disney isn't really the same. Disney is just super successful in terms of movies people are interested in. Disney isn't in command of the market, there's countless numbers of companies that are in direct competition with Disney. Them being able to negotiate better terms to show their own movies isn't indicative of a monopoly, just their popularity and clout. The same goes for Apple which provides products in a super competitive environment, 

&&I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre good for not holding monopolies, there‚Äôs just more than one way to skin a cat in this industry.&&There's one about Maynard James Keenan on r/toolband&&I really liked Carter, but maybe only because it ticked off some tropes I love, especially with that ending.&&The annoying thing about the Blade argument, to me, was that it‚Äôs like saying, ‚Äúwell there was a black superhero twenty years ago, so it‚Äôs dumb that black people are excited about being represented on screen again.‚Äù &&Complete agreement.

Putting out a wide number of films but barely making any money on each one is still a smaller market share than out selling them all with one big movie. 

I think what you're talking about is that Disney doesn't own all of the film property out there, but that's not market share. I don't know what the term would be for that... Percentage of all assets owned? &&There's one about Mod Ash in r/2007scape&&For me, the annoying thing about Blade is that people were deliberately ignoring the difference between a movie about black people and a movie with a black person. 

Blade, Dr Cooper (I think), and Blade‚Äôs mom were the only three black people in Blade. Well, four if you count the teenage vampire girl who shows up for less than a minute on screen. The plot had nothing to do with them being black either. To compare that with a movie where the hero, villain, mentor, love interest, tech person, comic relief, sub-plot characters, etc are all black, a movie where the central plot line is directly related to black and African history, is just asinine. 
&&The issue was the claim that he was the *first*&&Also, I am old enough to have seen Blade when it came out and I liked it well enough but I wouldn't even have considered it a superhero movie. If that is a superhero movie surely Twilight is too?  I mean the main character has super powers and fights baddies but it isn't what most people generally mean when they say a superhero movie.&&At least it was pretty consistent in being a comedy and they allowed whatever dramatic moments there were to breathe before making a joke.

After Odin died Loki didn't immediately make some sort of lame pop culture quip. Like Quill ridiculously turning into Pac-Man a few minutes after finding out his dad killed his mum. That was inexcusable tonal whiplash and spoiled it.

Also all of Ragnarok's jokes landed. GOTG2...not so much.  &&Im from dc and have never had an issue getting a free cup of water in my 29 years. So that‚Äôs def not the norm.

I'm a gold member and spend way too much at Starbucks. And they want to charge us for water? Water has been free at every other Starbucks location I've been.&&Not if they die in line. &&I'd really dispute that the FF or X-Men are their ""biggest draws"" anymore. The movie audience has eclipsed the comic audience by orders of magnitude--case in point how they can take B and C list characters like BP or the GOTG and make them popular. &&The crowd was the worst part of seeing it for me, they wouldn't stop cheering whenever any character appeared on screen and that fucking sucks when there are like 50 major characters. I've rewatched it twice since it came out digitally and can say 100% it's better than in the theater with a crowd, some scenes look better on the big screen but not when the crowd won't shut up because Bucky is standing in the background. &&This was the intuitive argument I couldn't articulate quite as well as you put it here. 

I loved the Blade movies but it had no where near the same impact of watching a whole community of incredible black people in every role you can think of. 

Even to an oreo like me, it was incredibly empowering and it opened my eyes to something I have always lacked, a black community. 

I did absolutely nothing with that newfound wisdom though lol&&I have to disagree on them allowing the dramatic moments to breath.

I think they undercut a fair bit of drama, and frankly they undercut the most important piece of drama, Ragnarok's destruction with the joke about ""rebuilding"".&&That's Vegas tho, everything has a price attached to it. Also ur in the middle of a desert.&&[deleted]&&The funny thing is, there really is no way anyone making that argument both remembers those movies and is arguing in good faith. Even those who didn‚Äôt get how the supporting characters and plot changes the impact of these two movies. 

Blade was a lone vampire hunter who was hunted by the police and robbed vampires and familiars to pay for his ammo and the medicine needed to fight off the ‚Äúdrug‚Äù addiction he was born with. 

Somehow that‚Äôs less empowering than a king fighting to balance his country and people between helping the world (starting in poor black neighborhoods) while keeping their culture intact. &&",2018-08-04 14:11:44
First Poster for 'POK√âMON: Detective Pikachu' Starring Ryan Reynolds,29385,99y7zx,https://i.imgur.com/WkYj0FD.jpg,1236,1535123522.0,,"Can this please be a gritty noir starring Pikachu&&I really want to see the trailer for Detective Pikachu. This movie is so mysterious and weird that I'm very curious to see the final product.&&I can't wait for seeing what's going to be the weirder movie next year: This or the Sonic movie.&&So, I assume this means we'll be getting a trailer soon?&&10$ says the first trailer surprise drops during Twitch's full Pokemon marathon.&&I still can't believe this is really happening. &&I don‚Äôt understand for the life me why of all the ways to do a live action Pok√©mon movie this is the direction they‚Äôre choosing. I‚Äôm hoping for the best considering it‚Äôs Ryan Reynolds and Pok√©mon, but I won‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs a shit show. &&Said this in the thread that got killed, but this was shown during the Pokemon World Championships, and the director used the opening ceremony audience as what he said would be chants for a Det. Pikachu vs Charizard fight. Pretty cool. &&Detective Pikachu: A Pok√©mon Story&&As much as I love Ryan Reynolds I really wanted Det. Pikachu to be voiced by Danny DeVito...&&I'm still waiting for this to be revealed as ultimate trolling from Ryan Reynolds.

I'm convinced it's actually Deadpool 3&&Hot take: this movie is going to be really good, and Reddit especially will love it.&&Noob question, is this canon?&&I'm stoked. Honestly, I have no idea what to expect from this movie, but I'm sure it will be hilarious because Ryan Reynolds is the man.&&Is Wade Wilson gonna shoot Ryan Reynolds receiving the script of this at the end credit of the next Deadpool? &&I haven't seen a Pokemon movie in theaters since 2000.

I'm genuinely excited for this.&&I am still baffled that they went with this instead of a regular Pokemon adventure movie&&This is an actual real thing?&&Watch it just be Ryan Reynolds in a Pikachu suit Wilfred style.&&Anyone getting a Star Wars vibe from this poster?&&I'm still not sure how I feel about this&&It should have been Frank Reynolds.&&Call me when there's a Danny DeVito dub out. &&I played the 3DS demo for Detective Pikachu. I can definitely see why they'd want to make this into a movie.

My only issues with it are:

1. I don't think Ryan Reynolds is right for this.

2. If this is live-action with a CGI Pikachu, are there going to be actual animals in the movie or are all the real world animals going to be replaced with CGI Pok√©mon? The game takes place in a world that has Pok√©mon instead of animals.

If they do a live-action world with CGI Pok√©mon running around in place of animals, I think that'll look really stupid. If they don't have any CGI Pok√©mon in it aside from Pikachu, then they'll be ditching one of the main aspects of the game which is that he's the only Pikachu in the world that can talk, but he can only talk to the main character. It won't mean anything that he's a ""talking Pikachu"" if he's literally the only Pikachu in existence.&&I've known about this movie for a while but my thoughts are still just...

WTF!?!&&Shoulda used Frank Reynolds. &&Starring Ryan Reynolds playing smarmy Ryan Reynolds for the 16th time straight &&Was really pulling for Danny Devito&&So it seems from Deadpool to Pokemon franchise ain't that big of step&&Ryan is just doing this movie so he can use it in deadpool 3 &&The fact that this will be an actual movie make me both genuinely happy and surprised by the weirdness of this world&&How to destroy your career in seconds... unless you're Ryan Reynolds&&Hi,I'm Deadpool. You might be wondering how I got here...and why the yellow suit?&&It really bothers me that the live action Pok√©mon movie we‚Äôre getting is detective fucking pikachu. &&Is this movie supposed to be aimed at kids or adults? I assume it's the former, but the whole concept feels like the latter.&&But, why?&&This is like one of those joke movies they use inside real movies. &&This is a joke, right? I‚Äôm not hating on Pok√©mon or anything but, a Pok√©mon movie, with Ryan fucking Reynolds?ü§îü§î&&So Reynolds has essentially become the cringe version of Dwayne Johnson. &&Never go full Sharknado, there can be only ~~one~~ six.&&Time to make the chimichangas&&How does a poster that just has the name of the movie on it get 8000 karma without vote manipulation?&&This looks like the Teen Titans Go To The Movies poster.  The logo for the game is much better than this. Anyway, I played the game and found it charming. Story was terrible and the overarching mystery was bad and predictable but Detective Pikachu was a wonderful character. I can‚Äôt wait for this film. Hope it goes all out in terms of silliness. &&At first I thought it read ""Defective Pikachu"" and was intrigued. Detective Pikachu?..Meh.&&Does anyone know if this follow the story of the game or is it its own thing? I wanted to play it when it got announced, but it came out in the States after the Switch came out so I never got around to it. &&Yeap thats definitely the title.&&Excuse me? Ryan Renolds as what? A trainer?&&Wait, what?&&Is this going to be like a Space Jam mix of real figures with animation? &&Wait what?&&The best part of the movie being released is when people immediately dub over parts with deadpool dialogue &&Still should've been Danny devito&&What the hell is this? ü§î&&Should have been Danny Devito.  &&Wait- this is a thing...?&&are you kidding me? this is a movie? 

When the DS game came out, everyone thought it was a joke. Then the game came out, and didn‚Äôt it flop? &&I can't remember if Alex Hirsch (creator of Gravity Falls) said he was working on this or not, but if irc and he is, I honestly am gonna get excited for this because that man is a genius.&&Ryan Reynolds is gonna be killing his past self once again in Deadpool 3. I'm calling it now.&&Im still convinced this is deadpool 3.&&This is real? Heck...&&I can't and wob't believe this is even a thing until it actually comes out and I see it.

[*The hell was coming, and I was coming with it*]&&**Pikachu's journal, October 12th 1985:** Dog carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. This city's afraid of me. I've seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood.

‚ÄúI never thought the sight of another dead Pok√©mon would churn my stomach, but this... well, let‚Äôs just say seeing something like this made me puke my guts like a rookie on his first call to a crime scene. I‚Äôve seen glooms OD on heroin, I‚Äôve seen digletts smashed like whack a moles at a county fair, lickatongues given Colombian neckties, you name it. But this was a tough pill to choke down, not just because of the hyper-violence that lay in front of me, but the fact that Psyduck was a close friend, he was confused, sure, but he had good intentions overall. He must have wandered off behind this alley in confusion before the massacre happened. Bits of Psyduck were strewn about like a kid who threw a tantrum, but instead of toys and books, it was bits and pieces of my old friend. A message had been scraped crudely into the side of the dumpster where the bulk of Psyducks remains lay. It was a simple 4 word message, but it sent a chill so deep it would make the marianas trench look like a damn rain puddle, the message read ‚ÄòTHE SANDSLASHER IS BACK‚Äô.‚Äù &&Mod LA Noire and replace the main character dude with Detective Pikachu?&&From what I've seen of the Detective Pikachu games, that wouldn't be too far off base for what they're trying to do. 

However, I still wish they would have cast Devito instead of Reynolds.&&I want Pikachu to speak English and just act like a cop and literally no one acknowledges he is a Pokachu.&&Well usually when a poster is posted here, there is a trailer the following day. So maybe we will see a teaser tomorrow.&&[heres a trailer for the game](https://youtu.be/HuwqoTe836s)

I‚Äôm very uneasy about the whole situation. &&Watch it just be Ryan Reynolds going ""pika pika!"" for two and a half hours.&&Sonic has Jim Carrey playing a live action Robotnik, and Sonic teaming up with a local beat cop.

We already have the anime  to tell those type of stories.&&Detective Pikachu was fairly successful on the 3DS, and they figured it'd be easier to adapt the shorter crime story  than it would be to adapt the longer main RPGs.&&Max Landis was saying a long time ago that he'd actually written a genuine Pok√©mon movie for the studio, but Nintendo got cold feet about licensing all their characters and decided to only license the one (Pikachu) &&that‚Äôs awesome.

>The game is a spin-off of the Pok√©mon franchise, in which players work with a talking Pikachu to solve mysteries

Talking CGI Pikachu teamed up with Ryan Reynolds.  I'll say now that this sounds like a terrible idea, but I've been very wrong about several movies before.&&It kinda does compared to having a preteen travel a whole region alone, battling and catching monsters while overthrowing a criminal/terrorist organization with the power of friendship and grinding&&Wasn‚Äôt there, just watched the stream.

Definitely asking for this.&&Only 35? casual smh /s&&Are spin-offs not canon?&&Actually, in the game, it's considered extremely weird that Pikachu can talk, especially since only the main character can understand him.&&But we got Meowth talking...&&The highest rated video game adaptation of all time currently is Rampage with a 52%. A 70% feels kind of hopelessly optimistic.&&I'm anticipating it will be a cult classic but poorly reviewed.&&Or not, if it's really good/well received.&&The people writing the animated movies wouldn't be the ones writing the live-action movies.

Besides, the *Detective Pikachu* game won't even be the latest Pok√©mon game once this hit theatres. *Quest* and *Let's Go* will be much more recent. So, it isn't exactly selling a new video game, either.

The problem that most people have with this being the first ever Pok√©mon live-action movie is that the *Detective Pikachu* property is probably the most out-there part of the franchise (when compared to every other part of it). It's, like, Sherlock Holmes fan-fiction set in an adjacent Pok√©mon world with a talking Pikachu. It has nothing to do with battling, training, trading and exploring that the anime, card game and pretty much all the other games (even *Pok√©mon GO*) do and accomplish. I'm not saying all the spin-off games necessarily do that; but, a good chunk of them still apply the franchise's core concepts to them (or try to).

For better or worse, at least the Sonic movie is trying to make a live-action of its core games. I'm not saying that it will be good (It probably won't be, at all.); but, I can at least give them credit for attempting something ridiculous. This, on the other hand? Meh, it's a way too safe of an adaption. Legendary Entertainment got the rights back when *GO* got released; and it just feels like, 3 years later, all this will amount to is a standard mystery comedy with Pok√©mon branding and the voice of Ryan Reynolds.

To put it into perspective, I'll say this: Pok√©mon is a massive franchise. Pok√©mon and nostalgia are very powerful. The ones who grew-up with the original 151 are now adults and have kids. We all saw how crazy this planet went during the summer months of 2016 when *GO* came out. This year, the franchise is returning to Kanto for its first ever console release with *Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!*. While I have some doubts about that game (thanks to the removal of a lot of long-time features), it'll still sell well. Why? People who haven't played the core titles in the longest time will be interested because it features the Pok√©mon they grew up with. Meanwhile, how popular was the *Detective Pikachu* game? The numbers aren't exactly official; but, it was one of the lowest selling spin-off Pok√©mon titles when it was released.&&They could also have done a Pokemon Origins/Generations thing but live action&&I at first assumed it was a pretty naked parody of Solo, but I also couldn't figure out why they would do that. So I don't know what to think.&&Just be happy you didn‚Äôt donate to it........&&My man the source is directly under the first image in the gallery&&http://viridiancitypokecenter.tumblr.com/&&With some Johnny Cash music&&It started like it always did.

[It all started with that smile. That damned smile] &&Get the squanch outta here with that.&&Depends on where the emphasis is. &&How do you think more pikachus are made&&This is a pre-release preview teaser poster. We'll see the real preview teaser poster tomorrow, then the day after that the actual poster for the teaser. Then the teaser will be released, quickly followed by the pre-release preview trailer poster. After we've had a chance to digest that, the real preview trailer poster will leak to twitter hours before its official - and possibly slightly different - release. After that we'll see the first instalment of the preview series of posters prior to the slow dribble out of actual individual character posters. Around this time the official preview trailer poster will be fading from our collective memories, so the actual poster for the trailer will be released and some time after that we'll get the real first trailer.

I'm not sure how you could make them into feature length movies without a lot of BS added in.

I suppose maybe you could adapt some stuff from the paper mario/mario & luigi/ mario RPG games to round things out.&&Its easier to set up a three act structure and self contained movie with a detective story. This is compared to the premise of a show where it's an ongoing narrative about a kid trying to be the best there, that no one ever was. Also the detective genre is something most people are pretty familiar with so it might make it easier for people who aren't too familiar with the games to ease in to the world of pokemon. Just my opinion. &&I mean the game is fucking great, idk how this will play out tho, in the game you're immersed in the 3d pok√©mon world, the only strange thing is that there is a talking Pikachu with a deep voice. And this... well this is live action lol &&I think Detective Pikachu and a human partner solving a mystery about stolen Pokemon that leads back to Team Rocket is a story that pretty much writes itself and has potential for a fun ride. You could even have a devious talking Meowth as a foil to the talking Detective Pikachu.&&I'm really confused on what I'm watching here. No mention whatever, just some dudes playing Pokemon&&They have a Sage Mode Pikachu. If these things were like $20 instead of $40 I'd totally get one but it's a bit too pricy for something I'm going to put on a shelf and forget about until I catch it in the corner of my eye and laugh my ass off. 

I have my old stuffed Pikachu from when I was a kid sitting on a shelf in my room and never even notice it lol. I forget it's even there. &&This being a cover for Deadpool that Reynolds has somehow organized might be the most Deadpool thing possible.&&Lies, lies, and more darn lies! &&There's only one man up to the job of unraveling this mystery.

The generation that watched Dora are teen or young adults...&&Anyone who can remember an era when Sonic was relevant is now in their mid-twenties or thirties.

College Humor was on fire back then.&&:(&&Yeah they announced it years ago.&&I thought they said it was gonna be a trilogy of three movies.&&I don‚Äôt think that was the premiere of the trailer&&I thought the Mario Bros movie actually had a good idea for the story. Two ordinary guys get sucked into this wild world where goombas and bo-bombs exist and they have to save their ""princess"" while trying to figure out this ridiculous world they find themselves in.

I'm not sure in the Mario universe where all the cyberpunk stuff came from, but the story had potential at least.&&Disney made a billion dollar franchise from a 5 minute ride.&&Legend of Zelda, meanwhile, could be an entire cinematic universe of movies - the plots of which influence one another in small but influential ways because time travel.

I'm all for Daisy being the main girl for the love interest of Luigi... But... Why is she the princess of the mushroom kingdom? 

I love how bad the movie is but holy shit they fucked some stuff up.

But hey, the person who did the world design for the alternate world did a great job for what they were told to do. &&I think you just answered your own question :P There's so much material in the story-based Mario games like Paper Mario etc.&&Thats not true, it was a licensing dispute, Nintendo/game freak wasn't willing to sell the rights to make pokemon movies for whatever the offer was, allowing the studio to capitalize on their most popular characters, so they compromised by selling the rights to detective pikachu, which isn't going to cannibalize their own movie market. &&I would love it to be a talking Trubbish just to play on the absurd levels of the premise&&Once they stop streaming, you should be able to check that thing as a whole video and see the opening ceremony at the beginning.

If it's after, it could be as lame as ""Return"" or as dramatic as ""The End"". I don't see any of the Fall or End being a possibility because...

It's definitely not impossible.&&It's easier to make something pirate-themed than it is to make something that represents a game series that already has a story that's pirate themed, though.

Someone high up in the company would have to devote so much time in keeping the movies true to the lore of the game, and make sure to higher someone with a passion for that game to direct it. 

Hollywood has stepped it's game up. The 90s were a bad time for game based movies and movie based games. But even today, you see movies failing to live up to it's source content like books and games. Even the Warcraft movie failed to grab the non WoW playing audience. Ready Player One, while good, missed so much of the book that it didn't feel the same. 

I would enjoy a Zelda movie, but I understand if it never happens.&&You gotta love that all the cars are electric because they don't have fossil fuels. &&Got a source on that?

EDIT: looks like it was Pokemon Co who was the one reaching out to Hollywood studios to make a live action movie featuring pokemon in a bidding war. There is no clause regarding which games they're allowed to base it off of.

In August 2018, Cawthon announced on the Steam forums that the first draft of the movie's script, which involves only the events of the first game, has been completed, and that there may be a second and third movie after. Blum also made a post on Twitter saying that the movie is aiming for a 2020 release.

Nah nah nah nahhh!&&I never had the adventure games when they were first out, but I bought them on steam, and yeah they're just... OK at best. Even for the time I probably wouldn't have liked them all that much, since Spyro and Mario 64 were already things I'd played and loved to bits and those games DO hold up

Some of the newer games though? Some of them are great and the only reason they don't get more praise is because ""lolol 3d sonic is bad"" meme. Sonic Generations had the greatest sense of speed I've ever felt when playing a game, it's like the Burnout games but turned up to 11. And the 2.5 classic sonic sections were awesome, and the music was fantastic, incredible remixes of the original classic songs.

Sonic Mania is obviously better, but honestly I still don't think it's as good as Sonic 3&K is, the level design in 3&K is just so good and the cut scenes in it were so well done and the atmosphere and music etc. Sonic Mania is better than Sonic 2 though.

But yeah I grew up with 2D sonic, then missed the whole 3D generation until I bought Generations on steam. I also got Lost worlds as it was bundled with generations, and yeah *that* one is quite a shocker. I need to try colours and unleashed too. But yeah generations is like a racing game mixed with platforming and the speed just feels so good.

And people still make mods for Generations, essentially making extra levels the same way the game did, remixing classic sonic into 3D.

A ""Biff Tannon Universe"", if you will.  

I haven't pinpointed the exact chain of events that caused the paradigm shift, but I do believe that numerous celebrity deaths and the current US administration are evidence of the paradox playing out before us.

That this movie actually exists provides new and even more unprecedented evidence for this theory.

My friends, we are on the ""Eggman Timeline"".

Around that time there was the emergence of cable networks (Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network), Disney showing that you could make a gold mine out of Saturday morning and after school blocks, and Japanese anime started to penetrate the US market. That all led to competition for talent and eyeballs as media companies took it seriously for the first time in decades.

Have to keep the mailing service until that changes.&&I also still get Netflix DVDs in the mail.  There is a distribution center (or whatever they call them) in my town and the turnaround is crazy fast.&&I'm one of them. Needless to say, there are many more good movies in DVD compared to stream.&&I like the fact that you get to watch the bonus features if you're on the physical disc plan.&&Yep, I do. There are only so many titles out there to stream. You can get virtually *anything* on DVD/Blu ray, however. &&God I remember the absolute shit show when Netflix announced Qwikster.  The stock absolutely tanked.  If only I'd had a crystal ball at that time.  &&Keep physical media alive.&&The dream of Netflix streaming was that one day you would be able to watch everything ever created in one place so they wouldn‚Äôt need the legacy dvd service.

Now Netflix is just a cheaper HBO with a limited selection. &&The streaming service is for when you want to watch something now, but are flexible as to what you will watch.

The DVD service is for when you want to watch a specific movie, but are flexible as to when you'll watch it.&&I am one of those people. I am good for about 12 bucks a month to Netflix. I have been watching Ally Mcbeal on discs, I had forgotten how entertaining that show was. I am now about to start Northern Exposure. It can cut binging time down to eight hours since you can only get 2 discs at a time now.&&I don‚Äôt see why more aren‚Äôt using it. Movies and shows are very limited when streaming. You can get virtually any dvd, even new movies, by using this. &&I'm considering going back to the physical DVDs. Streaming seems to be losing more and more content every day. &&Thanks to this post I decided to sign up. There's some movies I want to see that aren't available for free on any streaming services and I don't feel like spending $5-7 on a rental. This way I get as many as I want for $10. Not a bad deal. &&> Here‚Äôs an obscure fact you might not necessarily be familiar with, given how thoroughly it‚Äôs been buried under the steady accrual of dust and time: Netflix got its start by mailing people DVDs. Like, through the post office. Yes, Netflix. Yeah, the BoJack Horseman and Orange Is The New Black people! They‚Äôd just mail ‚Äôem out to ya, in these neat little red envelopes! It was bizarre.

Fuck you AV Club. 

Also conmparing the number of US disc users vs *global* streaming customers is an odd/*dishonest* measurement. &&A lot of people still don't have access to internet capable of streaming.&&I still do the one disc at a time.  Dropped down from 3 disc a few years ago.  Also use the public library (Denver) to rent new and older movies in Blu-ray or DVD.  I'm sure every city is different but the library is a very good resource.  You can still walk in and rent movies for free like it was Blockbuster!!  And the catalog is just as good if not better then Netflix. &&Because a lot of the good movies are exclusively on DVD.&&I still get DVD and love it. There is SO much that is still not streamed.&&And I'm one of em, though I might not be soon since I've started to go to my library for movies a lot more.&&A little different, but I collect DVD‚Äôs of any movie I really liked or that had an impact on me. Even these days if I watch something on stream I will go buy it on DVD new or at a second-hand store. Call me old school but I think it‚Äôs cool &&Fuck I miss walking into a blockbuster. That feeling of euphoria when you see the movie you came to rent available in the new section.&&I quit renting the DVDs, when they separated the plans (used to be able to do both), because at the time Netflix had a ton of movies, and DVDs were kind of a hassle. Now Netflix has fewer good movies (due to media companies trying to create competing services), and more Netflix exclusives (which are hit or miss for me), and has doubled their subscription costs; I wish I could go back. 

The problem is, DVDs are still a hassle. Half the time, they came in the mail scratched. Most of the time, our DVD queue was filled with the kids' movies, and we never got the chance to watch what we wanted. To top it off, we haven't actually owned a DVD or Blu-ray player for like the last 7 or 8 years. If I did though, I would totally switch back. 

Between Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime (and the high speed internet needed to use them), I'm paying almost as much as I was for cable, which was the reason I switched in the first place; and I still don't always get to watch what I want (although, when I do, I get it when I want it). 

TL;DR

I can see why people are still using the DVD-rental plan.&&TIL all 3 million dvd-plan subscribers are on reddit &&There are a LOT of movies that are not available on their streaming servers.

I assume Netflix is still the go-to for foreign/old/rare movies....?&&I am too. I hope they begin to offer 4K discs soon. &&I am too. I rent a a physical movie from Nextflix, if i like it i end up buying the movie. I love to own physical copies of movies.&&The dvd selection is much better than streaming.

&#x200B;&&I‚Äôm watching a Netflix DVD right now. It‚Äôs a daily part of my life. &&Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.&&The ""luddites"" who get the dvds in the mail are actually getting what they want instead of settling for something from the thin streaming catalog. What fools they!&&TIL that Netflix still has a DVD rental plan&&Some people don‚Äôt have high speed internet where they live so thats probably them. &&To be fair, the DVD selection **far exceeds** the streaming selection. &&We are in a somewhat rural area with data caps on internet service, so being able to rent DVDs makes sense over using up your monthly data allotment.

I'm surprised it's down to only 3 million accounts, no wonder we have fast turnaround! &&So, what you‚Äôre saying is, only 3 million people get access to actual new releases that aren‚Äôt bullshit Netflix originals. &&Don't have Netflix, but if I signed up for again, I'd want the DVD subscription. Better to pick from the large selection of old movies and TV shows on DVD than watch lots of direct to Netflix crap.&&Remember a few years ago when they tried to spin off the physical disk branch of Netflix into another company called Qwikster and people were basically rioting?

The best part was that guy with the @Qwikster handle on Twitter that thought he was gonna get super rich off it.&&I dreamed a dream, I got 7 + 1 or 2 in store rentals, the rest via Blockbuster by mail DVD's at a time for something like $20, maybe grandfathered  in on some deal. 

It was the good days, a program called ""DVD X Copy"" could be purchased at Walmart before being banned and spindles of blank DVD media was getting cheap.

&&How else am I supposed to fill up my Plex?&&The thumbnail looks like sliced meat. &&The DVD Netflix has a lot of great foreign films and new releases which the instant Netflix doesn‚Äôt. &&I'm tempted to sign up for this plan &&I get the DVDs (Blurays).  Most convenient way to see all of the newest movies without waiting ages.  With the two out plan, I get 8 each month.  

Going to really suck if they do shut down in future...&&I deliver mail and I can guaranty those 3 million live in my city lol. Always 5 at a time for a lot of my houses n a route.   && I didn‚Äôt even know they still did that! &&Remember when it use to be like $8.99 for both ?&&My parents  (i.e. me) live in the middle of fucking nowhere. They have satellite internet. So no streaming. It's nice that Netflix hasn't abandoned physical dvds. &&Physical media is comfy. The streaming service ends with me wasting a half hour to find nothing. &&I have the three discs at a time package. With a fairly close distribution center I can get, usually, 6 discs a week. Things you can't get on streaming.&&...and if they hadn't raised my streaming plan by $2 a month, I would still be using the dvd in the mail plan... but they didn't give one crap about us who had been there since the start... hey netflix, hope that $2 a month increase you got from the ones that stayed was worth the $20 something a month I spent  that you are no longer getting.

&&Rental plan! Lisa needs braces.&&Netflix has a bigger selection of movies on DVD than on streaming.   Also Netflix does not pull movies every month from their DVD collection  as they do for the streaming service. &&I love my Netflix DVDs!&&I have a friend who lives in rural Kansas and he gets about 2-3 MBPS via DSL.  He doesn't subscribe to any streaming services.  These are probably still the people doing the disk plans.&&Considering their DVD library is 130 million times larger than their streaming library, I really can't blame them.&&I used to get 3 movies out at a time and burn them send them back and get more. I slowly stated dropping my plan back when streaming became a thing and now I just do the streaming any new movies I want I either just rent on Amazon or buy physical copies. &&I'm one of them.  I appreciate having a much larger selection of movies to pick from. &&Had no idea they still did it. & of course it's a US only service.&&There‚Äôs quality content on those disks. Lots of titles available that you can‚Äôt stream. &&Why use the word ""still""?  I get to see new releases before they hit their streaming service.  The big draw for Netflix is their back catalog.  In between release cycles, I get access to more than Netflix streaming, Amazon Prime, and Redbox have.&&You can still get actual movies from Netflix via DVD, compared to the direct to video SyFy tier crap they stock their streaming catalog with now. &&I use it to rip blu-rays.

It's not a bad deal at all.&&I completely forgot they did that.&&I recently lived in a remote location where streaming wasn't an option.  No cell service and only internet option was satellite&&I take full advantage of this. I get Blu-rays through it, rip them, and send them back.&&Blockbuster fucked up, big time. &&That's 17.16 billion a year just from subscribers. &&When you're near a distribution center, mailing is a fantastic plan. I remember in college on days without classes I could get the mail in the morning, watch 4 episodes on the disc, and get it mailed out by that afternoon. I still use discs in the mail because there's no other way to get so many titles. &&After years of streaming only I went back to discs. No regrets. fast turnaround, blu Ray. Ironically I thought Netflix was a scam in the early days because the thought of an easy to get/return DVD in the mail seemed so impossible. &&Up until a fe years ago, we did as well. Internet just couldn't handle streaming.&&I just signed back up, my wife and I made a big list of movies to watch, most of them aren‚Äôt steaming currently. Some were recently but just got taken off which is frustrating. &&I still have a one-out plan because there are lots of shows that aren‚Äôt streaming. &&Didn't even know Netflix still offered DVD rentals &&> 3 Million Netflix Subscribers Are Still Using DVD-Rental Plan, Compared to 130 Million Streaming Subscribers

The insinuation from this title is that people are choosing to rent DVD when they could instead stream. This premise is false. 

 *1 Netflix streaming does not offer a lot of ""Hollywood"" movies

 *2 streaming ""Hollywood"" movies from iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, etc, often costs anywhere from $5-7, which is prohibitively expensive (I'm surprised anyone pays these prices more than twice a month (i.e., 2 movies a month). In the beginning of Blockbuster, I used to rent more often. As the price continually went up and up, I slowed my renting until toward the end when movies were around $5 a rental, I rarely ever went to Blockbuster.

 *3 DVD viewing still offers the best presentation. No interfering with the movie by shrinking credits, no on-screen popups asking if you want to skip part of the presentation. Extras are offered but you get to decide if you want to watch them instead of everything auto-playing at the end of an episode, which I hate.

 *4 some movies aren't available to stream but are available on DVD.

Customers don't have a real choice. If DVD Netflix goes away, people won't be able to watch as much content as they just won't be able to afford it and/or find the content.
&&The main reason I quit the plan was because they seem to not replace disks when they run out of them. I had several titles on my list just disappear. Then they showed up on the list of movies they don‚Äôt have in stock.&& I didn‚Äôt even know they still did that! &&Rural America? Millions of people still don‚Äôt have access to broadband. &&I used to get disks.  And they would sit on a shelf for a month before I send it back.  Sometimes unwatched. &&[deleted]&&I get it. I stayed subscribed to the DVD plan for a long time after the streaming got big. I liked having the wider selection and I didn‚Äôt mind having to wait. But I moved to Cincinnati last summer, and their public library system is fantastic. They can get me pretty much any movie I want to watch, sent to my neighborhood branch for free.&&I used to until I moved near a library that basically has the same amount of dvds I had on my list on Netflix and I just kept the streaming&&I‚Äôm one of them as well. It comes in handy during Halloween time when I have a movie theme in mind and most of the films I have on the list to watch are not available for streaming. &&Thumbnail looks like bacon.&&I've actually been looking at signing up for the DVD plan... but it's just too expensive.  I can't justify paying an extra $15/mo for the DVDs on the monthly streaming expense.&&I prefer to have access to 100% of Netflix‚Äôs catalog as opposed to only about 1%. Call me crazy.&&My parents do snail mail because they have terrible internet&&I'm among them. The BRD selection is way better than the streaming selection. &&I think all the DVD renters are on my mail route. I swear I deliver a ton of them every day.&&TIL: Netflix rented out DVD‚Äôs, like 15 years before I thought it was founded. &&It'll never change, sadly. All Netflix needs to do to offer a movie via DVD-by-mail is to spend $10 to acquire at least one DVD, and now it's in the catalog. Meanwhile, the streaming rights to more and more movies aren't for sale to them at any price. Unless someone figures out what the hell the digital equivalent of right to first sale is, Netflix may be boned in the long run.&&That‚Äôs exactly why I still have it. People are so surprised that I still get the DVDs but they know how much stuff has been removed from streaming. How else am I supposed to watch them? Go back in time to a Blockbuster?&&I came here to say exactly this!&&I'll one up you here bud... I still go to Blockbuster. Last one in America is in my town.&&I do both. The DVD selection is *far* better than the streaming selection. &&Lucky! I moved and now my distribution center is a full extra day away. Gotta really plan out my film week. &&There is also stuff on disc that doesn't stream. I have both. I'll keep both as long as they offer it.&&Enjoy it. They closed the distribution in my town a few months ago. I'm lucky to get 3 a week now instead of the 6 or 9 I was getting. &&Same. And if they're going to keep randomly pulling stuff from streaming it's a good compromise. 

Plus I miss special features. &&The selection is larger than their streaming site&&Yea article should read: ""3 million Netflix subscribers are still copping dvd's through mail subscription.""&&I don‚Äôt remember the name but last month I was in a small town in east Texas with my grandpa and he took me to an independent Video rental store very much like an old Blockbuster. It was like stepping in a time machine back to 2005. &&I too am one of them. I like being able to rent DVD basically immediately after they come out on home video, whereas on the streaming service there isn't a guarantee it'll be there at all and if it does it will be long after its release. I am astounded by just how many movies they have on DVD. Even the most random titles. Lately though I have been trying to keep a collection of DVDs for myself. Netflix is still a good source of movies I want to see if I'm not sure whether or not I want to own it yet.&&Agreed. Especially older/atypical titles. David Carradine's Tai Chi Workout for Beginners? It can magically appear in your mailbox, in mere days. &&TV series too. Instead of getting a bunch of different subscriptions, Netflix streaming + DVD gives you access to 99% of the content out there. Not really sure why it's not more popular; the only downside is you have to do slightly more planning ahead.&&Plus you can get Blu-Rays. My internet has never been good enough to consistently stream HD quality so that's a huge bonus. Plus much better selection. They still have some baffling holes in their filmography but at least they you know have some films made before 1980. &&[deleted]&&I live in an area with only DSL. If it were not for the DVD rental plan, I wouldn't even HAVE Netflix. &&DVDs are currently the analog hole in digital rights.  It makes no sense to me to not have the netflix dvd plan.&&And if you are into the home theatre experience you are not getting a compressed version.  Edit: I miss spoke as DVD s are still compressed but I would still take one over a Netflix stream if I wanted to make a small gain in consistent pictures and 5.1 sound. &&I am also one, and yeah. The quality of the selection seems to be better. I have streaming mostly for comedy specials and a handful of shows. But their streaming movie collection has declined in quality as the invest in ‚Äúoriginals.‚Äù It seems like they just buy a lot of the stuff cable networks like SyFy would normally buy. &&I like the extras on DVDs, especially for TV shows.&&I just get them from the library. &&A lot of great foreign and old old movies are either only on DVD or are only available in HD via Amazon streaming for purchase/rent&&Me too. Watch at least two a week&&I remember I used to actually watch the shit I selected for delivery, now I just scroll through and fall to sleep.&&There‚Äôs also quite a few folks that have shit internet that‚Äôs insufficient to stream&&If they offered 4k blu-ray rentals then I'd probably sign up.&&[deleted]&&Ehh, not always. Some studios started providing Netflix and other places special ""[RENTAL](https://i.imgur.com/6jwPv5R.png?2)"" discs that have all the special features stripped. I got quite a few of them when I was still on the disc plan. I only saw them with blu-rays, though, not DVDs.&&You also get to watch the un-skippable previews for old movies that appear before the main menu.&&Oh wait. Can you stream bonus features ? Or are you just talking about when you receive discs?&&Nothing wrong with that. But I switched to digital rentals a few years ago. It works for me because I happen to watch more tv shows than movies, so when I occasionally feel like renting something that isn't on one of the streaming services I subscribe to, doing so on Google Play or Amazon is simple and doesn't require any prior planning. I imagine that's the case for a lot of people too.&&Agreed. I think any serious film fan does. I. Never understood how people could be content with just the streaming content. &&How much is it?&&Better selection, but also better picture and sound on Blu Ray than streaming.&&It's crazy how well after that disaster they transitioned the idea that Neftlix meant ""films by mail"" to ""streaming films and tv"". Hell no one really even noticed when they changed the DVD side to be called ""DVD.com, A Netflix Company"". &&Can someone explain to me what exactly was so terrible about Qwikster(other than that horrid name)? It doesn't seem that terrible of a decision from what I know about it.&&And then the Qwickster boss had to go and ruin Moviepass. &&Yeah, Qwikster was supposed to be the beginning of the end. Funny to think about now.&&[deleted]&&As long as the US Internet infrastructure is shitty physical media will live. Hobestly I like bluray. I like the special features I luke the boxart anf I like that I can watch it any time. Yeah you can downlad movies onto storage but they also take up a lot of space.&&TBH, the only reason we really keep our subscription is because there's a decent selection for the kiddos. &&> watch everything ever created in one place

good luck with that ever happening&&So the physical service has every movie on offer?&&Northern Exposure is such a good show. Enjoy. &&Now I'm humming the Northern Exposure theme song. You son of a bitch. &&Oooh single female lawyer, best show in the universe!&&I literally never knew it was an option, and now I can't seem to find a way to actually sign up for it.

I'm guessing that's why more aren't using it.&&It isn't available outside of the US, that's why.&&They split the price. Not everyone can have both in their budget. The majority chose Streaming.&&Honestly, I think it's just how lazy people have become. Ordering a physical disc requires you to physically move to return it. Also, I think that slowly fewer people have access to a device that can watch DVDs, for e.g. newer laptops don't have disk drives, and there's no easy way to watch a DVD on portable devices like phones or tablets.&&Came here to write this. When they introduced streaming, my queue of ~100 films had about 35 available for streaming: not bad. Today, I practically never find anything if I search a movie. As in literally, when Reddit has one of its ""hey guys what's your favorite movie"" threads, usually none is available.&&Especially with all these companies wanting to have their own specialized streaming service. &&Even better, look to create your own plex server. That way you can rip the Netflix dvds and have your own personal library again &&As many as you want doesn‚Äôt mean the same thing for DVDs since you have to wait for each disc to come, but this post has me thinking of resubsribing after over five years without. Nowadays streaming selections are getting worse and worse. &&I do a combination of dvd's from Netflix and Redbox. Usually get the new releases from Redbox on my way home from work, and use Netflix for the older/more obscure titles. I love Netflix dvd, but man it can take forever to get some of the newer ones&&It‚Äôs like moviepass except it doesn‚Äôt suck.&&What a bizarre condescending attitude about the mail. Yea, it's how you get your shit from Amazon too dickheads. 20 years ago there was no video compression algorithm that even existed to push DVDs across the Internet, let alone the CDN possible for a service like that to exist.&&Obscure? Here is another o word.. They are belong obtuse.&&> Also conmparing the number of US disc users vs *global* streaming customers is an odd/*dishonest* measurement.

Yeah that's the first thing that jumped out at me. 3 out of 60 million is still an impressive stat, why not use something that makes actual sense?&&There's zero chance Netflix would want to invest in DVD mailing overseas though.&&The AV Club is always sarcastic. This is obviously a joke. Good lord.&&This is super obviously a joke lmao chill&&I gotta wonder what the percentage is at this point and how the numbers are calculated.  Access vs willing to pay for speed fast enough to stream does come into play in rural areas and parts of the US with older people.  My parents could pay 25 dollars a month and get 50 mpbs up and 15 mbps down but are not willing to do so cause of the extra cost.  She then complains about how crappy facetime with her grandkids is.&&Agree!&&Libraries can be good but my god some of the discs are in such absolute garbage shape. Any kids film you can just forget it. I think the parents drag the DVD back to library from the back of their car, they are so messed up.&&I've been doing that myself for a little under a year. It never occurred to me before, really, but one day when I was getting some books anyway I thought that it was something I really should take advantage of. I regret not doing it sooner. &&I do this with bluray discs. If it was a part of my life its worthy of my money.  I have a couple of hundred dvd's and blurays. I have a pretty hefty pirated movie library as well, although i've stopped my illegal downloading for the time being.&&You‚Äôre not alone. If I want to always be able to watch a movie because I enjoyed it that much, I buy it on DVD/Blu-ray. Never have to run into ‚ÄúOh, Netflix got rid of it‚Äù that way. And if Netflix ever becomes not worth it, I can cancel and still have access to my DVDs because I own them. People mistake a show/movie being on Netflix for ownership when they really shouldn‚Äôt. &&I do this all the time:

- Goodwill, Value Village, and other discount second-hand stores generally sell DVDs for the same cost as it would be to rent it. Plus, full seasons of TV shows. 
- Libraries went through a philosophical shift over the last couple decades, recognizing that they should stock the libraries with content the people want instead of the content librarians think the people need. In short, they got a whole lot more fun, and they have tons of movies, free to borrow/rip, which is a great way to figure out whether or not something is worth owning.
- Walmart, Target, and other big box stores sell some really random collections. You know, all three Blade films, and the TV show, for $5? It's awesome because a lot of times things go on great sales. I own the first 15 or so seasons of Simpsons - $9 each at a black friday sale. $7 each on Big Bang Theory (that was my wife). 
- Amazon is phenomenal for TV shows. They sell so many of these things at ridiculous prices. Even new ones. For example, all seven seasons of Star Trek TNG, on Blu Ray - $70 new. And because TV shows are generally more expensive because of more content, they scale away the added cost of shipping something that you wouldn't pay in a retail store. 

I pay $11 a month for Netflix. That doesn't translate into much when it comes to buying, until you realize that buying means forever (and DVD extras). Eventually I'm going to outgrow Netflix, but I will never outgrow my media collection. &&DVD or Bluray?

What is that, 5 Gigabit per second bit rate?&&I think there are a lot of parents in this boat, who will jump to Disney's service when it launches. News reports claim that Disney is throwing their TV show and kids backlog onto the service, which means 90s and 00s kids who grew up on Disney Channel or ABC Kids are going to be able to re-binge a lot of content that was lost to time.

If you aren't into TV-MA Netflix Originals (not judging people who are), Netflix is approaching Walmart-bargain-bin levels of quality with their library. They have variety, but they really struggle to populate the platform with TV that a whole family can enjoy watching together at the same time - and that's really important to most families. On top of that, their 10-episode seasons mean you _have_ to constantly be branching out find new shows, because something like Nailed It is a week's worth of television - or 1-2 days if you binge it. 

Again, for some people it works really well. But boy did we take a step up in product quality when we decided to add Curiosity Stream, PBS Passport, and Great Courses Plus to our line up.

I have an uncle whose **only** options for internet access were either dial-up or satellite until three years ago when Spectrum finally decided it was worth it to run the line to his house, and he lived literally 1 mile outside of their service area.

He paid $90/mo for satellite internet where he got three mega**bits** per second download and zero point five megabits per second upload. With a hard five gigabye/week cap.

And that was his *only option*, for any price.

So yeah, maybe percentage-wise the number of people who can't stream isn't very high, but even if it's only 0.5% of the US population that's still over a million real people who functionally don't have internet access in 2018.&&Rural internet service is pretty shit&&Lol we‚Äôd pay, but they immediately hang up when we give them our address.

Redbox is especially known for it, though, they've been known to buy out local inventories at the Targets and Walmarts to stock their machines, because they can't get enough copies otherwise. It also conveniently costs less and reduces stock for customers to buy, pushing them to Redbox as a result. &&No, they have to buy rental version discs. There will be a license fee attached by the studios that varies enourmously.  My family has a rental shop still, and the fees can be as low as $5 and easily as high as $500 per copy.

I, for instance, purchased what *was* unlimited access to 'Much Ado About Nothing' starring David Tennant and Catherine Tate a few years ago on DigitalTheatre and a while back they changed their service to a rental-only, subscription-based model. Now I can't access that media I purchased and, although the site says I have access to it for a few more years (programmed into their system as a long-term rental), [a look on their support website shows that many other users have had no luck accessing their purchased content.](https://digitaltheatre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015723787-How-do-I-find-my-restored-purchases-)

Thus I always need to go to the post office.

Also, a lot of what I watch is TV, so having to get 4 episodes at a time kills me. I'm not a patient person.

If mailing was easier for me though, I'd definitely go Netflix DVD in a heartbeat, pretty good deal, especially with redbox being expensive and the chance of some sort of credit card scanner on a redbox (not sure if that's possible, but I'd assume so).

I'll miss it when I finally quit. All the movies I can watch during my shift, cheap rentals and very cheap used discs (in great condition most times).  
Got a lot of my Hongkong action movies from that shop.

I do have the excuse that I lived in Italy with a shite DSL connection where most of my collection came from.

The sound track was filled with 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs hits, for most the sound track clicked perfectly with the old school Miami setting and is considered the soul of the game.

One more time, motherfucker.

Sincerely, Netflix&&You work in an office?

Ask the front desk to drop it with their mail. 
&&Buy a mailbox&&I‚Äôd wager the selection of torrents is wider than Netflix‚Äôs. Who, by the way, are also capable of not providing content they stopped sharing them. &&Yea I just downloaded the fifth element and starship troopers the other day. It‚Äôs not on Netflix or Hulu and it‚Äôs only available on Amazon as a rental. Also you can get shameless and walking dead pretty much immediately without having to wait months for them to be out on Netflix &&If they even have commentary. Every movie I've wanted to watch it on lately doesn't even offer it.&&I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre buying your movies...&&No, I didn't know that. Ever digital download I've ever purchased was the film alone.&&TV shows are were it hurts though; can't [usually?] rent them... so you are pretty much limitted to either buying them outright, or hoping whichever streaming service you use has it in their library.

tbh though, if its a show that isn't on Netflix/Amazon, or a show I want to watch real time, I just dish out the cash.  Lots of shows I'd like to see though that aren't streamed on Netflix/Amazon and not really worth spending the cash on... that's where I start looking at DVD service.&&Also, if you try to take advantage of how many discs are possible for the month they will send you a stern email letting you know that your account may be suspended or terminated because they suspect pirating.  &&Unless it's had a physical release, no.&&Netflix didn‚Äôt cost extra for DVD then, and  Qwikster was essentially the cost of the entire Netflix service, at a time when most people were still using DVD. &&At the time, Netflix's streaming catalog was just beginning to be the focus. Most earlier subscribers thought of Netflix as the subscription company, with streaming as an added bonus. &&I remember that. It was hilarious &&And ABC and ABC Family. And A&E. The History Channel. Lifetime. ESPN. The Live Well Network. The Buena Vista backlog. The Touchstone Pictures backlog. And that's just some of what Disney had _before_ they bought Fox.

Disney's UK offering suggests that their platform will also include music and books published by Disney (I strongly suggest people [check it out](https://disneylife.com/uk/view) if they want to see what Disney is thinking). It also includes a permanent discount on the Disney Store, and other benefits - for the USD equivalent of about $6.50 a month.

The only downsides are:

- Disney is going to want to keep it family-oriented, which IMO probably means a platform that looks much more like Disney Channel's catalog than it does Disney's full collection of IP. 
- Disney is going to want to push new programming on the platform, meaning even back-logged family programming may be limited or entirely absent. &&Big up for PBS Passport. No idea it existed until we wanted to catch up on Great British Baking Show and now I've got years of Frontline and so much more viewing that respects me as someone capable of thinking.&&And it's a shit deal for the artists but what choice do they have other than not being on Spotify&&Yeah, if you don't mind waiting a day or two to get the next discs.&&Largely because it is much easier and cheaper to get rental license than it is to get streaming license for content.

Netflix heavily banked on it would be large enough to turn the tide on that and instead got burned with only making the streaming even harder and now others to get in the streaming market.&&144p came later, actually. Around 2012ish IIRC, meant for mobile connections. &&I still remember watching Jizz in My Pants in HD on youtube and being shocked at the quality.  It didn't look like the internet, it looked like TV&&realplayer, man.&&It's actually not even expensive putting down fiber in rural areas. You use a plow and put down several kilometers per day.&&They won the lawsuit.&&Yeah, I thought the old VCR tape contract had tiers that allowed higher fees for rental use, but someone goofed and the DVD disk contract was the same price for whatever.&&No. They buy the license to rent the movie (or number of movies for x number of days or months) then have to purchase the media too. If one gets lost the license isn‚Äôt tied to the physical media - they just buy another copy (or charge the customer who did lose it). 

For example: I want to rent ten copies of the latest sharknado movie in my store. I may buy ten licenses for a month to cover the initial surge of suckers who want to watch it, and ten discs (maybe eleven, in case one is lost or broken during the initial surge, I can only have ten out at a time). 

After a month, I look and see I averaged 8 rentals a night but it‚Äôs dropping quickly, I only renew two license the next month and then one after that until I no longer want to rent it out and need the shelf space for some other Hollywood turd. 

Due to the fact I had to purchase all the media from retail outlets, I can sell the unlicensed copies in my store or online to people who want to own it without running into trouble with licensing. &&*No car? No problem! Just take the 101 bus to Anderson Court and get out.

Franchise owners could keep using the name if they paid Dish a licensing fee but were otherwise totally on their own with no corporate support.&&Jesus. I had no idea. I'm most likely to remember Scrubs, I'll have to check that out. I wonder if Grey's Anatomy will have the same problem in a few years, as I understand it it's known for trendy cool music at the end under the monologues. &&That's was the dirty secret - get a DVD, copy it, and return the next morning.&&Yeah these days everyone I know who has the dvd subscription just rips them to hard disk.&& We used to have the three plan as well &&I believe that&&It really does hide that fact well. Their UX designers knew what they were doing. 

So many sequels and not enough of the original movies. I do like some of their original content but having Ghostbusters 2 without Ghostbusters is just plain shitty. &&>If only Prime Video could be subbed to separate from Prime.

This was an option back in 2016, but I'm not sure if it is offered anymore

On iTunes a lot of the movies do have the extra content included on disc and a menu system similar to a disc to access the special features like commentary and Behind the Scenes stuff.

If you can use MoviesAnywhere link all your accounts up. Tons of movies that don't have special features from the original place I bought them, do have them after being linked to iTunes via MoviesAnywhere.&&Namaste out of this conflict.&&It's wider but still slimmer. The more elite otrrents within a certain niche maybe but torrents have this weird scope of 3-5 years for movies and maybe a larger scope for the most popular stuff. Everything else gets forgotten and then eventually forgotten. Digital is cool for it's ease I wonder what will be lost soon.&&One of my favorite sets was the DVD boxes for the Lord of the Rings movies.  The ones where each movie was a different color.

There were soooooo many bonus features.  The blu-ray didn't even come close.

what lol&&Well once you look at all the other costs you can see how rapidly things escalate.

Tag -> Catch Me

You Were Never Really Here -> A Beautiful Day

Miss Congeniality -> Miss Undercover

Tomorrowland -> A World Beyond

Taken -> 96 Hours

Hard Eight -> Last Exit Reno

Unknown -> Unknown Identity

Cradle 2 The Grave -> Born 2 Die

A Man Apart -> Extreme Rage

Jack The Giant Slayer -> Jack And The Giants

Bend It Like Beckham -> Kick It Like Beckham

Thor: The Dark World -> Thor: The Dark Kingdom

Just off the top of my head.&&My favorite German title was for ""Dude, where is my car?"" was changed into ""Hey Man, wo ist mein auto?""

I know it's basically a literal translation, but it was just funny to me. 

&&In Italy, too. &&Same as in Japan (though they also add an exclamation mark): https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/„ÇØ„É¨„Ç§„Ç∏„Éº„Éª„É™„ÉÉ„ÉÅ!&&https://imgur.com/a/vlqzPlE&&I specifically work in this department. Sometimes it changes completely, just a direct translation or it stays the same. 
It depends on the brand/title and if it‚Äôs known/recognisable in that particular territory. Its very common and happens to every major film release from The US.&&When WWE used to do their Elimination Chamber PPV I think they called it ""No Escape"" or something like that.

For obvious reasons.&&Well the amount of East Asians in our country is probably below 1 %.

It's not like there's a target group for this in Germany.&&I accidentally called this movie Rich, Crazy Asians when buying a ticket. I got a few bad looks.&&In Israel it's 'Rich by Surprise,' which is totally lame if you ask me.&&‚ÄúTop gun‚Äù in China was translated to ‚ÄúA very big gun‚Äù ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø &&As a British person, if I knew nothing about this film I would assume it was about Indians or maybe Pakistanis because that‚Äôs what ‚ÄòAsian‚Äô means here.&&It's probably just called ""Crazy Asians"" in Singapore.&&Hats off to the Germans for not seeing race.&&Going to Germany soon for the first time...do theatres play all their movies dubbed in German or do they have English screenings too?

EDIT: Wow thanks for the suggestions guys!

I'm actually going ro Dresden...any luck over there?&&Poor Rich. I'm sure he's not crazy.&&My personal favorite was a korean newspaper that called a movie ""quiet sheep"". My mother was confused as to what movie it was. Turns out it was silence of the Lambs...&&So we already got Crazy Rich Asians, so when we getting üÖ±Ô∏èroke Ass Niggas?&&What am I supposed to do with this information? &&Same for Japan.

Japan is weird. They don't see themselves as Asians. They see themselves as Japanese. Everything else outside Japanese is just ""foreigner"". Crazy rich Singaporians (the people in the movie) might as well be Crazy Rich Black people or Crazy Rich Indians. It would make about as much of an impact on many Japanese. Like the whole white washing thing with Ghost in the Shell. They interviewed a ton of Japanese people. They didn't give a fuck. They were like it's a Holly wood movie, who cares. Japan represents itself. As long as Japan makes and gets Japanese movies and TV, they don't give a fuck about asian representation outside Japan. Ohhh but have a Chinese person play a Japanese characters and then they get fucking pissed (memories of a geisha... People we're PISSED!!!!) &&Isn't this exactly what people want? A generic rom com that just happened to be about Asians? Dropping it from the title does more for that than actually having ""Asians"" plastered on your face. &&Should have changed it to rich asians instead, the fact that they‚Äôre asian and the different culture is actually quite central to the movie&&Honestly I would have preferred they just call it 'Crazy Rich'&&I...don't get why this is notable? International cinema often changes titles for domestic audiences.&&Craisins. &&As an Asian, I prefer this title to the original. &&In France purge election year was just called American horror&&I think people are missing the point of the movie (or the book, in the first place). It's to show how the unbelievably rich asians do their things with money. That's just it, offering a different (AND REAL) point of view. Splash it with actually good romance and comedy, and bam, a good movie, nothing about Hollywood politics or racism.&&This is very old trend in Europe. I remember ""Encino Man"" being called ""California Man"" over here.&&That‚Äôs weird. In San Francisco it was released under the title ‚ÄúActual Home Owners in California Who Happen to Also be Asian‚Äù&&And here I was halfway expecting it to be ""Crazy Reich""&&Waiting in line at the ticket booth yesterday (Seattle, USA), I noticed every single person only called the movie ""Crazy Rich"" and the movie I was seeing was just being called ""The Klansman"" as if everyone is terrified of possibly offending someone by saying ""Black"" or ""Asian"".  &&Don't forget the ""Crazy Rich Us"" in Asia&&that looks like the mom from Fresh Off the Boat.  i swoon for that lady.&&I don't know about Germany but in Bulgaria that's very true. First movie was translated as ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", perfectly preserved title, so far so good. ""Winter Soldier"", however, was ""Return of the First Avenger"". Finally, ""Civil War"" became ""The First Avenger: War of Heroes"". It's weird because most other Marvel movies have preserved their title, but I guess the first Cap film flopped here, so they decided it was the title's fault and changed it. On a semi-related note, there's no way to properly translate the word ""Infinity"" in Bulgarian without it sounding kind of dumb (so for example the Infinity Stones are called Eternity Stones here), so ""Infinity War"" is simply translated as ""Avengers: War Without End"". I don't know why, but I find that highly amusing given that the titular war without end lasted for like a day at best.&&""We did a focus group, and the word 'America' isn't helping sell tickets right now"" &&Yeah. Captain America: Civil War is called Avengers: Civil War here.&&What do they call Captain Britain? &&I live in Seattle but love going to Richmond BC all the time. The amount of luxury cars driven by rich asian kids in Richmond and Vancouver supports this title lol&&""Normal People In Richmond""&&They might even qualify for a mortgage for a house there, too.&&Ahha fuck, I came to make this joke. Just call it ""Asians"" &&In the book the characters talk about owning homes in Whistler. &&Yeah it‚Äôs probably a weird movie for that town; half the city wants to see it, the other half fucking hates it because it‚Äôs a reminder of how fucked up things are.&&When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was about Vancouver &&In Denmark they either do horrible translations or they change the title to something entirely different that they think makes sense. Examples: Shawshank Redemption was named A world on the outside. And something like 13 Reasons Why was named Dead girls dont lie&&Man, Brazil is waaaaaaay worse. It seems our industry thinks our audiences are idiots, and so they dumb down a lot on the titles, to a point where it is completely enfuriating:

Some examples, off the top of my head:

The godfather -> the powerful big boss


Rat race -> Everybody is insane! A race for million$


Airplane -> Buckle up, the pilot is gone


The Thing -> An enigma from another wolrd


The graduate -> the first night of a man


Parenthood -> the shot that hasn't backfired


Final Analysis -> Desires, someone has been seduced


&&Some of these are understandable, e.g. ""kick"" instead of ""bend"" and ""born 2 die"" instead of ""cradle 2 the grave"" are simply easier to understand for an audience where many still aren't very good at English. But others like ""96 Hours"" and ""Kingdom"" instead of ""World"" are baffling.&&The best of all time was:

The Pacifier -> Der Babynator

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Babynator&&One of my favorites when I was in Paris a while back was seeing a poster for The Hangover 2 but it was called ""Very Bad Trip 2.""&&Captain America: The First Avenger -> The First Avenger

Captain America: Civil War -> The First Avenger: Civil War

I don't recall the name of the Winter Soldier in Germany but I am willing to bet it's either just Winter Soldier or First Avenger: Winter Soldier.&&Home Alone -> Kevin Is Alone At Home

The Germans are quite literal people.&&The Taken one was interesting. Do you know if 127 Hours was released with it's original name?&&My Favorite is the new Predator. 

Original Title is ""The Predator"" 
German : Predator: Upgrade&&""Die hard"" became ""Stirb Langsam"" which is just Die slowly. But it actually adds to the title for me (pretty fluent in both languages) since ""slowly"" sounds just a bit more sadistic and brutal.&&The Amy Schumer movie Trainwreck was called ‚ÄòDating Queen‚Äô in Germany. &&i'd like to share a few hollywood movie titles in korean. some titles are awkward transliterations and some have been translated awkwardly.

\* Edit: lots = enough not to be seen as exotic. 

From my comment further down... I think it's just a vocabulary thing.

It's not like the term ""Asiaten"" is used as commonly as ""Asians"" in American English. I mean, I don't remember ever hearing ""Asiaten"" come up in a casual conversation, just maybe in a textbook or classroom type of setting. I don't think Asian cultures are grouped together quite like that in German. Some Germans I know just call them whatever ethnicity comes to mind, used to drive me nuts when my ex said he was going to pick something up from ""the Korean"" when referencing the Vietnamese cornerstore.
 
Anyway, maybe the word was dropped because it's too stilted (in German).
 
There was a German nineties movie, ""Japaner sind die besseren Liebhaber"" (""Japanese men are better lovers"") which I think was moderately successful. The word ""Japaner"" is used a lot more commonly in conversation than ""Asiaten"" so unlike ""Crazy Rich Asians"" that sentence just sounds ""normal"".

&&This comment reminds me of a German lady a guy I knew was dating. We went to a Korean restaurant for dinner that served grilled meats. Even though it was just a sliced steak, she picked and poked at everything and asked, ‚Äúis this safe?‚Äù

That's how you feel when there's an ocean between you and the rest of the continent.

Like, yeah, turns out people see people from other countries as foreigners and North American notions of race don't exactly apply elsewhere.&&> Japan is weird. They don't see themselves as Asians. They see themselves as Japanese. 

Man, like, generally it's more America and Canada to an extent that do the race first and then everything else. Like say, I'm Irish, born and bred here. White isn't a culture or identity, it's not even something people think of. Like if I met a lad who was black and not native to Ireland (as in born or grew up here), if he's English, I'll think of him as English first, if he's from Ghana, I'll think of there first etc. 
&&>Japan is weird. They don't see themselves as Asians. They see themselves as Japanese.

I mean white people from Germany don't see themselves as white but German...&&Why is it weird that Japanese people see themselves as their own ethnicity? The term ‚Äúasian‚Äù as we know today only exists in America, where they basically lump similarity toned people from China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, etc. together. Despite some cultural similarities, the Asian countries are still very distinct and different. I imagine a Russian person would consider themselves Russian, and not white.  I think you are under the impression ‚ÄúAsians‚Äù refers to a homogenous culture/people just distributed between different countries, when that‚Äôs just not true at all. &&> Japan is weird. They don't see themselves as Asians. They see themselves as Japanese. 

Well yeah. Because none of us who live in Asia called ourselves Asian. It‚Äôs just a western thing. &&That's because what you think of as the ""asian race"" doesn't really see that they belong together as the same race (given the gigantic size of the continent and diversity of the population), it's just a term of convenience that Western countries decided to put them all under and see them similarly, and thus they have a similar experience/ experience similar stereotypes when they come to the West - but not in their home countries. There, because of their history and cultural differences, they really don't see that they belong together oftentimes. Also, what they percieve as issues are different from what Asian Americans percieve as issues too - because the issues that Asians face over here don't really impact them and thus they don't really care all that much about it. But here in US, it is incredibly hard for Asian Americans to land starring roles outside of stereotyped ones like Kung fu master, some sort of assistant, some nerdy/ geeky types, etc. They rarely have relatively normal and starring roles in Hollywood/ entertainment industry until recently - a problem that Japanese do not face in their own country and media, nor Chinese, etc. Thus, this movie is more impactful in the US than abroad... where these issues don't really exist and people don't really understand the issues that Asian Americans face either.&&Most asian ethnic groups are very discriminatory against other groups &&No I don't want it to ""happen to be about Asians"" - I want it to intentionally be about (East) Asians 

Which the movie and book do - they intentionally go into Chinese culture &&I agree.

I would have preferred this ""Crazy Rich"" title as well.&&Since there's no major Asian minorties in Germany and nobody knows shit about the Asian culture in the US, distancing it as much from the original as possible is smart here. Just make it appear as some random rom-com and not some movie in which you probably won't get half of the jokes. Doubt American audiences would be interested in a movie called ""The East-Frisian"" either. &&Well...the family was racist. Grandmother and mother would have blown a gasket if he'd brought home a white/black/brown woman. They were freaking out because she was from the wrong class of Chinese.&&Maybe it‚Äôs that. But i thought the point of the movie was highlighting the differences between growing up asian in a western country vs actual Asians back home(yes there‚Äôs a difference) and the cultural differences between that &&I definitely want to believe that they rent out cargo ships to party in international waters so they can fire off RPGs into the ocean. &&That happened.&&Probably because it is the mom from Fresh Off the Boat.

They see themselves not so much as Asian as Japanese. Being Asian as a race is very much an American thing. &&Uh, no. 

I see the people in the movie as Asians, because they're Asian.

&nbsp;

I'm from Malaysia, it's called Crazy Rich Asians in Malaysia. 90% of the characters are Singaporean, who are very similar to Malaysians in culture, appearance, accent etc. because Singapore used to be part of Malaysia.

What I'm saying is that I don't see them as American.

There are hardly any American characters in the movie. I think there are more British accents than American ones

&&How many of the actors are even American though. Literally only Ken Jeong, awkwafina and Constance Wu are American.  And the majority of characters are definitely Asian, Chinese Singaporean to be precise. 

I swear y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt even seen the movie.&&I mean, it's weird to see the whole movie as american when one of the central plot points is the tension between asians from asia and asian americans. &&*Crazy Rich Americans Poorly Playing Asians* was too wordy.

(Just making a joke, I loved this movie.)&&https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datsu-A_Ron

It's more like Japan doesn't treat themselves as ""mere Asian country.""&&Not off the top of my head and I‚Äôm in work at this very moment haha. But, not translation related - I found an ‚ÄòEaster egg‚Äô in last years Kong film while working on it (and I‚Äôve not seen it on movie details) One of the credits, just before the animation settles on the name it pops up as LIQUID SNAKE for 1 or 2 frames. Nothing major but I‚Äôm a fan of the series and thought it was cool. No one else in the office cared aha. &&This film is probably too American to be as successful in Europe

It's too American firstly because it's centered on community culture. There definitely is racism and communities in Europe, but the US is more obsessed with race than Europe is. I'd argue that the question of race, ""identity politics"" and whatnot, tends to make most Europeans rather uncomfortable, whereas Americans are very much into it. 

Not saying one is better and the other worse. It's just a difference in culture. America, even when it was much whiter, and white-centric, back in the day, had this idea of ""hyphenated Americans"" : Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, German-Americans, Japanese-Americans...etc. 

However, European cinema does occasionally produce movies about ethnic minorities. Ethnic-minority subjects in movies are often specific to the country they're from. Every country has their specific minority cultures, and thus other countries may not get the subtleties of race dynamics. A basic action movie is easier to sell worldwide... So an American film about Asian-Americans may only really be understood by Americans or Canadians.

I'm from France, and here we have had some successful comedies centered on ethnic minorities being caricatures of themselves. A great example is ""La v√©rit√© si je mens"" franchise, which is centered around the French Jewish community. I wouldn't expect a non-French person to get it, with a few exceptions perhaps, like other European countries with sizable and comparable Jewish communities, like Britain perhaps.

Another thing that may hurt ""Crazy Rich Asians"" in Europe is the difference in culture between the US and many places in Europe, regarding the display of wealth. American culture puts a lot of emphasis on the ""American dream""; wealth is a reflection of your hard work, it's earned and respected. Grossly, Americans don't resent the rich, they want to be like them. In much of Europe, displaying your wealth is considered of extremely poor taste. Not saying there aren't any Europeans flaunting their money in a Lamborghini, just saying that your average Joe will resent the wealthy. Maybe that's due to the fact that historically, wealth in Europe is associated to inheritance and nobility, and exploitation of the poor. In the US, you have this whole fantasy of the ""self-made man"" for example. Obviously, there's a lot of inherited wealth in the US too, but you also have the idea of ""from rags to riches"", which can happen in Europe too, but isn't part of our fantasies. 

So ""Crazy Rich Asians"" to Europeans sounds like racial politics + wealthy people being happy about themselves. I don't feel these subjects appeal to many people on this side of the world.

PS: also, yeah, Asians in Europe are rather discreet. There are some large communities here and there, in Paris, London, surely here or there in Germany and other capital cities in the West, but even then they're still fairly under the radar.&&Just saw it on Thursday here in NRW. The cinema shows it three times a day. Two times in German one time in English which is what I watched.

It‚Äôs sad that a lot of movies get released so late or with so little screenings because ‚ÄòGermans don‚Äôt want to see that‚Äô.

I'm from an Asian country, and believe me, the things their children go through when they find out their boyfriend/girlfriend isn't Chinese... It's bad. Also, this isn't just something the crazy rich would do, it's something even the middle-class think. (I can't speak for the lower-class as I haven't spoken to one.)

Let‚Äôs just say for sake of argument that of that 4.8%, 100% of them are Chinese. No Americans, no Europeans.  And just to be safe let‚Äôs also double that number and say there are Chinese nationals pretending to be Canadians through proxy/family buyers.  Even with those extreme assumptions, seems like Chinese buyers would only account for 5-10% of the housing market.

Do you know what they call Chinese food in China?

Food.&&*Meanwhile, in Malaysia...*

""Come on, the main guy are Malaysian! And that character's mother too!""&&It's because Asians (as that term exists in the US) get lumped together in America. We end up having similar experiences despite different heritages and backgrounds. Similarly, Jamaican Americans and African Americans might come from very different heritages, but will also have a lot in common because in the US they're both seen as black. &&That's not unique to Japan. Basically every light skin toned Asian associates themselves with the nationalities with the exception of maybe the Singapore and Malaysia (eg. Malaysian Chinese) and even they do so only because they live in highly multi-cultural societies.

‚Äã

Also, if you think about it the term Asian itself is stupid considering more than half of the Asian population are ethnically ""brown"" (Indian subcontinent and Malay archipelago).&&Correct. It's all about context. In England asians are Indians and Pakistanis. Chinese and Japanese are Orientals.&&I‚Äôve lived in Japan for 16 years. Japanese here see Japanese-Americans who don‚Äôt speak Japanese as just Americans. &&I swear like half the cast is from Phua Chu Kang.&&These people aren‚Äôt even Asian and they are saying this is about Americans and that the actors are seen as American when that‚Äôs not even true at all lmao.  &&We haven't because it hasn't been released in Japan yet so&&You're missing the point. The guy you're replying to is stating that people *living in Asian countries* don't think of the actors as Asian but rather as American *regardless of their actual nationalities*.

Your comment about people not having seen the movie is misguided if it's directed at the guy you're replying to because he's not saying that he thinks the actors are American. And, if that comment goes out to people living in Asian countries, well...you're right. It's not even out in Japan yet, for instance (and there's very little buzz surrounding it).&&Damn. Id like a screenshot of that&&The movie isn't really about the struggles of minorities though.  It's more of a straightforward ""girl falls in love with boy - discovers he is a prince from a far away kingdom"" story just redone with an Asian cast.&&> There definitely is racism and communities in Europe, but the US is more obsessed with race than Europe is. I'd argue that the question of race, ""identity politics"" and whatnot, tends to make most Europeans rather uncomfortable, whereas Americans are very much into it.

Are there not many European movies dealing with the struggles of ethnic minorities? &&I‚Äôve seen it twice this week in Europe (Holland). With almost no free seats left, with an audience of mostly caucasians and asians. So, I‚Äôd say its doing very well here. &&>  the US is more obsessed with race than Europe is

Depends on how you look at it.  In Europe we have entire countries designed around ethnic/racial lines.&&Saying that the US don‚Äôt resent the rich is so far off the mark. And I think a movie specifically about Asian-Americans has much more to do with a large Asian population in America than with ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äù.&&We generally make distinctions based on ethnicity and religion, not race. Although with the increasing americanisation of european culture the race aspect has been picked up by a lot of people.&&Europe is more racist than the US, just less open about that racism but that'll change as Europe becomes less homogenous. &&The movie does not even take place in the US lol. Y‚Äôall are just saying shit just to say shit. It takes place in Singapore and the majority of the actors are not even American.&&> PS: also, yeah, Asians in Europe are rather discreet. There are some large communities here and there, in Paris, London, surely here or there in Germany and other capital cities in the West, but even then they're still fairly under the radar.

Which is pretty stupid because A. there are European films that have the racial names tied to the movie titles, e.g.: Germany's Conquest but then you have this simple movie, WHICH most of the scenes TAKE PLACE in the EAST by the way, and you have Germans taking out Asians from it.

The point is, it's about Asians, whether or not they're Americans. They are Asians. It's fresh air to see Asians finally breaking out.&&> I'd argue that the question of race, ""identity politics"" and whatnot, tends to make most Europeans rather uncomfortable, whereas Americans are very much into it.


Hmm. Maybe comparing white Americans to white Europeans, I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs something there. But both of them still have an uneasiness approaching race compared to racial minorities. &&> but the US is more obsessed with race than Europe is

I have always found it very odd how interested the US is in ethnicity, ancestry and origin. Was at a stand-up and this guy in the crowd claimed he was like 15% Wichita or something. Fuckin' 'Gordon Belmont', or 'Ashton Richford' who works in IT, or whatever, and he's really pleased about his Native American heritage, like Chakotay with his spirit guide or something.

Everyone wants to tell me they're 20% Scotch ('Scahtch'), and in Scotland it's just not a thing. As Frankie Boyle said, if you're ginger it just means somewhere along the line you've a female ancestor who wasn't much of a runner. &&If you think Americans don't resent the rich, I strongly doubt you have ever spent much time in America outside of a tourist trap or two. 

Of course Americans want to be rich, so do Europeans. That doesn't mean Americans don't resent the rich. Look at the Trump cult, the whole thing is predicated on Trump supposedly being uniquely positioned to attack the rich who are exploiting the ""real Americans."" That position is completely absurd, but that was the appeal made. &&For like. 3 years if I hadn‚Äôt mistaken.

&&no usually the term used by Americans is ""Asian"" -- if they're being more specific or are more geographically/culturally aware then people say East Asian. But I've had a number of people ask what I mean even when I say East Asian, and then say like ""oh right. Asians"" -- you get some people accurately saying Southeast Asian someone frequently.

It's amazing how many Americans don't comprehend people from the subcontinent being Asian. Even watched a Pakistani friend argue with an American ""You're not Asian. You're Indian.""

Also I'm not Indian.""&&Only if you're very internet-ised, and so used to the American usage I think.&&Randall Park would have been great&&And the english .&&There is no fine line about that.

It‚Äôs about a Pakistani immigrant in the Paris banlieue and, once again, it‚Äôs more about the cultural shock and struggle to fit it than the fact that he‚Äôs marginalized because his skin isn‚Äôt white or he wasn‚Äôt born in France.

Because European countries have one preexisting culture, and immigrants are asked to intigrate. In the US it's different. It's a country built by immigration, and thus every immigrant group has a say on the evolution of American culture.

I'm not judging either way. It's just how it is.&&The movie isn't about Singapore, it just so happens to be set **in** Singapore&&Well yes, but a big part of the appeal  of the movie is about how an Asian-American is confronted with Asian culture.&&Nah, the entire topic of race is approached quite differently in Europe where discrimination is often much more cultural or ethnic than racial (see for instance how Polish people were seen sorta as the UK equivalent of Mexicans in the Brexit debate).

[The recent Trevor Noah debate](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/french-american-identity-politics-world-cup-trevor-noah/565637/) illustrates how the American take on identity politics isn't quite that universal.&&We tend to feel much more strongly about local identities here in Europe. For most people the in-group isn't ""white people"", it's locals. Then of course we also have a disconcerting number of actual racists, and the situation is changing quite rapidly.&&I think Americans are into ancestry because we're not an actual bloodline (unless you're Native American). So being American comes with the curiosity of ""what am i?"" It's like being adopted and wanting to know who your biological parents are. You'll always consider your adoptive parents your real parents but you just wanna know who your real parents are. It's like a puzzle piece of your life that's missing.

If you're American it just leaves you with missing puzzle pieces. *What* am I? So you search your last name, oh it's swedish! Then you take a 23andMe test, oh I'm 26% Native American! Etc etc

And some nationalities keep part of their culture rather than dumping it entirely to become American. So you have Mexican Americans who aren't like the typical Mexican or the typical American. They even have their own name; Chicanos. So some nationalities come here and become their own separate culture. In my one example given, a Chicano might not identify as American alone because they have their own unique culture that's a mixture of both Mexican and American. It even creates a type of divide with Mexicans not considering them Mexican enough and Americans not considering them American enough. So it even comes with different struggles.

Tl;dr American kinda means nothing bloodline wise (unless you're Native). So we wonder what our bloodline actually is.&&To be fair though, it's very understandable. The US is a country built on immigration, whereas European countries ask of their immigrants to integrate in the preexisting society, more so, and with more legitimacy, than the US can.&&Think about how many people call Trump smart solely based on the fact that he owned a business that made money

&&I'm sure some Americans resent the rich.

But it's peanuts compared to how strongly the resentment is for Europeans, or at least French people in my personal experience.

?&&Right, ""Hangover"" wouldn't sound very good, but it has to do with how the languages work. In most Slavic languages, you can't just grab any word and make an attractive, catchy title out of it. Or, for example, English is fond of gerund titles (as in, ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Running Scared""), but it doesn't always work very well across language families. As another example, in English, you can even grab any part of a given phrase and it would work well as a slogan of something. Like, ""Go beyond"". Sounds cool! But ultimately just doesn't work in some other languages.

Tldr, localization is legitimately tricky. Although Russian distributors are infamously known for twisting titles to appeal to last-minute ticket buying decisions. A straightforward title will probably yield more tickets than a clever and cryptic one.

Crank became ""Adrenaline"". Inception became ""Beginning"". It's not political, it's mostly pragmatic.

The Expendables became ""The Uncontainable Ones"", and tbh I don't think there's a good way to translate ""expendable"" as a single noun anyway. But then, Stallone's Bullet To The Head became The Uncontainable One (singular), which is quite obviously a crappy hype attempt.

> because that's just the natural state of a significant portion of the population every morning

Drinking *is* a problem, yes, but it's not quite as widespread as the overall life expectancy numbers would lead you to believe. For example, countries like Finland also have vodka as a staple of their ""image"" *and* considerable consumption as well, backed by numbers, but it's far from being the only factor in life expectancy.&&Your stats are right, but none of this played into choosing a title for the Russian audience. They just went for what's marketable.&&Taken 2 The Streets: Electric Boogaloo&&Cool question! I had to look it up... Looks like James Earl Jones kept their shared voice (Constantino Romero), probably because that's the voice he had in Star Wars, which was around that time. 

Arnie was given a different voice... The one of Sean Connery, Burt Reynolds or Charles Bronson.

Fun fact: because of dubbed movies, I only learned a few years ago that Arnold or Sean Connery had an accent (my life was empty and now it's full of memes)&&It's a joke.

But if we want to get pedantic, ""Chinese food"" in the US includes both American Chinese food and authentic Chinese food.&&Yea. I tried googling it and nothing came up.&&It's definitely there. It just looks a bit different than in the US.&&La Haine is such a great movie.&&It made $25 million opening weekend in US+Canada. That's a population of about 360m people. Netherlands has 17m....so US/Canada is about 21x more people. $214k x 21 = $4.5 million. 

Yeah, not crazy numbers but solid numbers for a foreign movie based on American and Asian culture. &&>That's a far cry from the record-setting numbers its done in the US.

Has it be setting records here? 83 million after 2 weeks on a 30 million budget isn't any record I'm aware of. It's *good* numbers, but record breaking?&&>[The recent Trevor Noah debate](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/french-american-identity-politics-world-cup-trevor-noah/565637/) illustrates how the American take on identity politics isn't quite that universal.

Which is kinda funny since Trevor Noah isn't American &&Those same people hate the Hollywood elite. They hate rich people if they're liberals. I think anyone who thinks Trump is smart because he's rich are just reaching for excuses to defend why they believe in him.&&Trump literally would have made more money if he had invested his 1 million dollar loan from his father in index funds than he has today through all his ""business ventures."" [Literally.](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2015/08/20/donald-trump-index-funds) He managed to bankrupt a goddamn casino, which is just astounding because that's about as close as you can get to actually fucking printing money if your name isn't Jerome Powell. And yet people still think he's a successful businessman because he's rich.&&They ruined Scotland&&That's amazing. As a European I'm only used to seeing the ones on the right. The USA ones almost look like a parody to me. &&Did stand up for 9 years in Alberta. Even toured. I was considered a pc comic.

Dim sum at Fisherman's terrace at Aberdeen centre is good. Checkout the food court at Aberdeen centre too, there are lots of good food there.

Each themed area has rides and attractions to match, so Tomorrowland has rides/structures/decorations which are believed to be the technology/design of the future 

Frontier land is like the American Frontier that American Western movies are themed after

Fantasy land is themed after things like Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, etc

Adventure Land is themed with Tarzan, Swiss Family Robinson, Indiana Jones, the Jungle Book, etc

New Orleans Square is made to look like the French Quarter in New Orleans, with The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean

Lastly, Toon Town is themed after the classic Disney cartoons

Nels‚Äô quiet life with his wife (Laura Dern) abruptly spins out of control when their son is unjustly murdered by a local drug cartel. Taking the law into his own hands with only the tools of an outdoorsman and snowplow driver, Nels sets out to find those responsible but inadvertently ignites a gang war that threatens to engulf the town ‚Äì unless he ends it first.‚Äù&&I thought he was done with action movies?&&I once had an idea for a Taken sequel (Pre-Taken 3) where Kimmy grows up and works for NASA, and Neeson is all like ""I can't protect her in space!"" and his wife's like ""let her go to Space Camp, she's an adult!"" 

So fast forward a bit and Liam Neeson has to hijack a space shuttle to get up to a space station to kill a bunch of aliens and rescue his daughter again.&&It'll take him 256 cuts to climb into the snowplow.

It seems Hollywood wants to take that spin, spin it back, and just make a traditional action flick.&&this movie sounds like it should have Steven Seagal instead of Liam Neeson.&&It‚Äôs very obvious why they‚Äôd remake it. There‚Äôs a market for an English language version and a larger number of people would prefer not to watch with subtitles. &&And Tormond has a cameo!!&&Loved the movie.

Best moment: the confusion over the year of the Ottoman battle vs simply the height.&&*Stellan&&I disagree. Haven't you seen Taken? Or Taken 2? Or Taken 3? Or Taken 4? Or Taken 6? Or Taken 7? Or Taken 8? Or Taken 9?&&I guess because no one seems to have heard of it ITT, so it's slightly better than remaking a well known film. I say slightly, because they will inevitably fuck it up like Oldboy and countless others.&&I would like to see some really out of left field casting. Imagine Patton Oswalt in this role.&&In Order Of Disappearance starring Stellan Skarsgard. Great movie with comedic moments spliced in.&&Original title is Kraftidioten. Literally translates to The Power Idiot.

Might he regional, by the way, if it's not available.&&That‚Äôs Clive Owen‚Äôs schtick.&&In the movie this is a remake of (*In Order of Disappearance*) the cartel is run by a rich Norwegian vegan guy with some anger issues.  
  
Edit: I feel like it's worth mentioning since it might be lost on non-Swedish/Norwegian/Danish speakers but even though it's a Norwegian film the main character and his brother are and speak Swedish, and the main bad guy's wife is and speaks Danish. Also the main character's brother has a younger Thai wife which is [fairly common up north in Sweden and Norway](http://mylittlenorway.com/2010/02/norwegian-men-and-import-brides/).&&Holy shit. &&Call Mr Plow.

Are they a cartel or are they local?&&You think that's snow he was plowing all those years? Neeson was in on it, moving powder by the ton every day. &&Hey it worked for Sons of Anarchy.  I mean what quiet little town doesn't have international gang wars with dozens of deaths daily. &&The snow mexicans!!!&&They're using the lifts to transport drugs obviously.&&The opioid crisis is actually hitting small towns pretty hard.&&I came here to say this. In no time when I was living in Colorado did I have exposure to local or non-local drug cartels.

Also the translated title of a Norwegian comedy.&&Lingonberry &&*Trollhunter* is one of the few Norwegian movies I can personally stand to watch (as a Norwegian myself). It's shot as a Blair Witch style fake documentary though, so it has a very different feel than ""regular"" movies.

*Izzat* is a Norwegian gangster/coming-of-age type movie that was pretty good, IMO.

*Elling* is like the poster-child for depressing and rough Scandinavian ""comedies"". It was nominated for best foreign film at the Academy Awards. To me it's a little too somber and depressing when you think about what you're actually seeing beyond just laughing at the gags, but YMMV.

*En Ganske Snill Mann* starring Stellan Skarsg√•rd is another decent shout; to me it feels a little more Swedish than many other Norwegian movies (probably just because of Skarsg√•rd, lol), which is a good thing because I prefer Swedish cinema over Norwegian. It's a dark crime comedy sort of film.

&&Headhunters, Max Manus and Kon-Tiki are probably the biggest films out of Norway. All worth the watch.

The first one is especially good, and features Jamie Lannister as the villain.&&For some reason I thought The Bothersome Man was German back when I watched it. Great movie, though.

It's a really weird morale, that we aren't really used to - but as a Canadian, especially from Quebec, it's one that can still resonate with me (we have a tendency of being a bit more neurotic) 

And that morale is ""enjoy what you have, it might be worst"".

The media influenced by the US tend to be more ""You should never settle, and always aim for a better life!"", so it's a bit weird to see its counterpart, but its certainly something important to consider too, we can't all afford the lottery of aiming to try and live the American Dream. &&ROASTED. &&jesus&&Fuckin rekt&&no u&&YOU'RE A TOWEL&&I saw that too ... but that high number can't be right, could it?&&> male me

And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fuckin' air-o-plane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us.

While some of their shows are decent, their movies actually hurt their reputation.&&Yes. The stories in Netflix movies are pretty bad. They get A-list actors and make mediocre-at-best movies.

Whyyyy?!&&That‚Äôs because she is really pretty &&I've had a crush on her for a decade.&&I think I fell in love with her during that scene she puts on makeup to David Bowie‚Äôs Cat People.&&Watch Beginners.

Netflix is spending money to make money, getting people hooked on their service. If people look forward to one new show or movie every month, they are more likely to subscribe/continue service. 

It‚Äôs working. They are profiting. Their stock is rising.

Is it sustainable? Time will tell. 
Looks like it will be for awhile.&&People really really underestimate how MASSIVE Netflix is. They've been seriously hurting cable companies for years. Having worked for 2 big name ISPs for years, a lot of time and money goes into combating Netflix. 

Never all that well despite major corps pulling together and creating Hulu, constantly trying to charge more or flat out revoking content from Netflix. &&They are losing a lot of content from other producers and instead of paying the crazy amounts for other peoples shows they are making their own now with that money.   Their shift to content creator has been coming for awhile now. &&More than they have&&I feel like the alternative is to rely on the content of others, which could become unaffordable or be revoked entirely (Disney pulling all Marvel for their own streaming service, etc.)

The future is tough making your own content, but if the alternative is no valuable content, they're just as screwed.&&subscriber growth is slowing (no matter as long as they are still subscribed), plus Netflix streaming around the globe (maybe about 100 million) now let's say they have subscribe for 3 months (3 billion)

 subtract hosting ,tech issue ,employees and any other thing related  (2 billion) ,

remain (1 billion) that's enough for 2 big movie 2 big series (ex stranger things) to keep people attention. 

an example of me, I don't like Netflix content, but I will subscribe again when stranger things season 3 uploaded and maybe too ,if the Irishman has a good review.

and finally, This is just an opinion based on noticing .&&I‚Äôve heard it wasn‚Äôt budgeted too high but it went over budget by a lot. &&Not as many as you might think: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062515/how-netflix-pays-movie-and-tv-show-licensing.asp&&They better have in the soundtrack somewhere.

Transformers, Bad Boys, Pain & Gain, etc are all exceptionally shot with some of the best action scenes in the last couple decades. &&Well they are almost hitting 100 million subscribers. So that is a fixed (more or less) income of around ¬£600 million per month. (based on the basic ¬£5.99 uk price).

That's massive. There are studios that would kill for that income. I would assume that because of these numbers that is how they can secure financing for the various projects.&&I don't understand why they don't spread the risk by making bunch of 50M movies. That way they can create more content to fill their catalog and there's a good chance one of them will be good. All this money wasted on  one movie that could flop and it seems there's no way to determine if it's a success other than new netflix subscribers which doesn't even seem scientific. &&I've not enjoyed any Netflix movies... though, I have enjoyed quite a few of their TV shows.

So the use of ""of"" doesn't seem that far off, and if over half the people speaking a language (according to your source), use the word in one way, then who's to say that's wrong?

Like remember when literally actually meant literally. Language changes. To fight the evolution of language is to engage in a futile cause.&&Poppycock. Never heard of this blue book, and *comprised of* enjoys widespread usage for over a hundred years. Major, known authorities such as Collins dictionary and Cambridge allow its use. So /u/captroop can enjoy his blowjob and then get out of here on the horse he rode in on!&&This is similar to people saying ""from whence"" when trying to sound fancy, since ""whence"" means ""from where"".

Correct: ""Go back whence you came!""

Incorrect: ""Go back from whence you came!""

But if everybody understands ""from whence"" and its usage becomes commonplace enough, it doesn't matter, since that means ""from whence"" will at that point be an acceptable utterance. ""Correct"" is only judged by what native speakers can correctly interpret.&&And thats what makes good CGI. All the movies that we praise as ""practical"" use CGI. Mission Impossible, Mad Max, John Wick, The Raid, they just use to enhance what they are doing not as a crutch. There is nothing wrong with CGI.

That strongly implies to me they would like to get Russell if he's willing/available.

The character just stumbled into something he doesn't have any reason to have continued involvement in. 

If you're bringing back actors, Dennis Dun's character has all the reason in the world to be involved again. It might be in kind of poor taste but he could take on role similar to that of Viktor Wong in the first movie. Lo Pan is dead but the scenario doesn't rule out ghosts so James Hong could reprise the role. &&Well since it's a sequel I hope they can fit him in there.&&[deleted]&&>Tremors reboots

""There are still two more, I repeat, *two more*...rooty-toot, pie eating, candyass, sumbitch, motherhumpers.""&&[deleted]&&I'd like to hope they would do what they did in the first movie and basically have the main character basically be the actual action hero's peppy side kick. 

I'd watch a movie where the rock played an incompetent idiot similar to jack burton from the first. &&Well, in the original, Kurt Russel is actually the sidekick thrown in for comic relief. That's kind of the deal with the whole movie. The main character isn't the hero. It would be great if the Rock plays some jacked guy that's a total wuss while some other smaller character handles the action, like in the original.&&Jack Burton is the sidekick, so if Dwayne plays the hero, the camera won't follow him.&&Its insane cause Big Trouble in Little China was literally the opposite of this trend.

Jack Burton was a goofball who talked big but got his ass handed to him every time. He only did one cool hero thing near the end but really just bumbled his way through. Meanwhile, his ""sidekick"" had the real motivation and real action competence.

And of course it's very standard in these kinds of stories for some bumbling fool to keep stumbling into these situations.&&30 years later, Jack Burton and the big hairy monster, having bonded over the decades, decide to hang up the CB. In the midst of a hellacious bender, he‚Äôs literally Shanghai‚Äôd when a triad gang recognize the beast he travels with. They find themselves on a ship leading back to a forgotten island where Lo Pan originated from and learned his black magic.&&yeah yeah yeah we all know wang was the real hero and jack was backup but still he had the spirit of it at heart. We need him.&&The story for the sequel doesn't have to be steeped in ancient Chinese lore. It doesn't even need 'China' in the name. Nothing stopping a sequel from exploring some other insane old folklore from another culture.

That being said, i don't want this sequel, as it won't have the same feel. Different actors, different director. I'll pass. I've been wrong before, though. &&Too bad he's cast as the 60-year decayed corpse of Ray Brower.&&There's 6 of those Tremors movies BTW.

I know, because I own them all.&&The first movie is an underrated masterpiece. Pls no rebooterino&&Im guessing this movie will consist of 177 jokes about him being short and the Rock not being short. And one about a white person being a white person, possibly their lack of jumping ability.&&Oh I doubt the studio cares about the ""joke"" of the first movie. It'll probably have The Rock making quips while Kevin Hart or someone plays the smaller sidekick.&&Rock's character from Southland Tales was Not-Quite-A-Badass, he could pull this off just fine!&&When I first heard about this I was picturing The Rock screaming ‚ÄúWhat?!?!  What will come out no more?!?‚Äù

And I thought he could fit.  In fact his bigger size could up the ante for just how out of his element he is for dealing with Chinese demons.&&He doesn't have to be a wuss, just out of his depth &&He‚Äôs the sidekick who thinks he‚Äôs the hero. It‚Äôs brilliant. &&Honestly, I think it would help with The Rock's overexposure.  His fans will still like it if when he shows up he does cool nonsense.&&Exactly, sounds like someone is trying to fuck with that great original movie.
And I bet John Carpenter doesn't have anything to do with it. &&If you want John Carpenter approved sequels to the original movie, check out the Big Trouble comic books.&&You leave Jack Burton alone!  And we are in his debt.  He showed, great courage.&&My favorite was the fight where he comes in, shoots the guns at the ceiling, and the plaster falls and knocks him out for the rest of the fight.&&To be fairJack Burton did have some wicked reflexes. &&this is going to ruin BTILC for future generations as well..  


They wont wanna see the old one when there is a new one.. then they wont appreciate the old one, because they watched the new one first...&&This. A lot of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies should have been horrible movies or were horrible movies but he kept grinding them out to the point of becoming a household name with an audience that would go see pretty much anything he was in whether it was bad or not. The charm was that Arnold made the movie and there would be Arnold jokes in it with Arnold quality action scenes. &&Plus some roles are just fun to play I imagine, add in a nice amount money and it's not hard to see why he wouldn't.&&We need a 3rd national treasure movie goddamn it!! I love them. My wife hates them. It‚Äôs win win. &&For a lot of Cage fans like me that‚Äôs part of the appeal. And he always gives it his all&&If you erase the worst half of Nicolas cages movies from memory,  he's one of the best actors of all time!&&But what if he co-stars with Kurt Russell?&&Live Action Akira w/ Leonardo DiCaprio has to be up there.&&Oh shit, and the plot twist is that it was Kurt Russel the whole time. Id watch it. Honestly he‚Äôd probably do better than the prequel that was made.&&I pray you can make it better down heree&&I hope Kurt is no where near this project. I don't want the a-typical old, plucky, throwback character playing some side role. You don't do that to ol' Jack, got-damnit!&&A slinky!&&A rolling stone?&&Studios are making interesting choices just not the ones you're paying attention to. &&In ballers he plays a completely different character, and they don't really rely on his big muscular appeal in the show, they rely more on his charisma.  &&He's different in Ballers, so he has the range.&&He's a producer himself and develops the scripts of most of his films these past several years. If he hops on a spec, he's usually the one making it more like his other projects - take DOC SAVAGE as an example. Probably a business call on his part, as he knows what his audiences want out of him (and for the most part isn't wrong financially). However, I think he's hit the ""diminishing marginal returns"" portion of his career. &&But couldn't he at least be doing better action movies? &&He's not just an actor getting scripts though, these films are all co-produced by his production company, and he's got producer credits on all these things. I believe Skyscraper was something he was the driving force behind getting made right from the beginning. Similar for Rampage.&&Didn‚Äôt he start out as an antagonist in the Fast and Furious franchise?&&he‚Äôs playing black adam in the black adam movie, then he‚Äôs gonna be in a shazam sequel.&&He played the last minute bad guy in the shitty Doom movie he was in.&&He was in get smart&&He's slated to be Black Adam whenever they get around to Sha2am!
He'll probably show up at some point in the first one and they're just trying to keep it under the wraps at this point IMO.&&Jumanji was a stinker?&&Who?&&Yeah, a plot hook that would let them make a trilogy of films. It's a gag, not a cliffhanger.&&Can you BAKKK what the BAK BAKKK BAK?&&Ack Ack!&&Dwayne's World should be a shot-for-shot remake of Wayne's World, but with The Rock playing every single role. Including Tia Carrera's.&&who would play Garth? Chris Helmsworth?&&Holy shit. The fuckin' wigs and everything... this has to happen. &&Chhya!

Just transplant the story to a Polynesian island where he lives in the jungle instead of the Australian outback. The trouble is, the Rock is super well known now and has already done comedy.

Rundown was him one-handing 2 shotguns and pumping them on his forearm. &&It was a 4x4, bruh.&&The producers obviously felt they were setting up not only a franchise, but an action star for this century who would be as big as Schwarzenegger or Stallone were in the eighties.

And then he just didn't make any more awesome action movies for years and years. Walking Tall was horrible and cut to shit, Be Cool, while fun, was very much not an action movie. And then he got stuck in the lead of two ""big action star has to play second fiddle to an eight year old"" movies (second only to ""big star has to play second fiddle to a primate"" movies as Hollywood punishment) The Fast & Furious movies started to turn things around a bit before he finally did some straight up action movies in the last couple of years, but I maintain that he hasn't done anything as enjoyable and straightforward as the Rundown in the fifteen (!) years since.&&Because you're just some no-name roody poo candy-ass. Meanwhile, the Rock is the jabroni-beating, la-la-la-la pie eating, trailblazing, eyebrow raising step off the break, put your foot on the gas, always ready to whoop some ass, People's Champ, The Rock!

Dwayne is a jock. What are the odds he's fetishizing a kids movie that came out when he was 24? For that matter, given what wrestlers in the USWA made, I guarandamntee you he didn't have the spare cash to see a movie.

It popped up on one of the movie channels we get at the house a couple of weeks ago and I'll be damned if I didn't like it a lot.  The Rock was great as always, but all of the supporting characters were just as good.
