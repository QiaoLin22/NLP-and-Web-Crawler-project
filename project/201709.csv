Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in 'Bohemian Rhapsody',66415,6yakju,https://i.redd.it/unqk62y3f4kz.jpg,2790,1504641815.0,,"Absolutely zero bulge. Disgraceful representation of Freddy Mercury.&&Looks great but if the Queen's vision of the story is still what they are going with its hard to get excited.

Edit: Sacha Baron Cohen discusses the band's vision of the film when explaining his departure: http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/sacha-baron-cohen-explains-departure-from-freddie-mercury-biopic-20160308&&He was electrifying in 'The Pacific' - a proper 'is he a psycho or misunderstood kid' vibe&&God I hope Sacha Baron Cohen wasn't right about what he said they wanted to make out of this movie. &&Holy shit. Actually looks pretty great. Really curious about this, I've been waiting for Rami Malek to make it big in movies for a while, and if this is as good as I hope, this might just do it.&&I would be *very* interested to see this. His character on Mr. Robot is about as different from Freddie Mercury as you can get. If he can pull this off it will show incredible range as an actor. &&I see a little Mr Robot of a man&&So is this movie gonna be some bastardized, family friendly version like the living Queen members wanted? Really wish we could've seen the Sacha Baron Cohen version. &&Here's a link to my full EW story for some context: http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/05/rami-malek-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody/

It sounds like Singer is scrapping some of the ideas SBC complained about to Stern. The movie's timeframe ends at Live Aid in '85.&&I think Queens mistake is thinking people want to see a movie about Queen, when in reality, people want a movie about the life of Freddie. &&Today is also Freddie Mercury's birthday, September 5, 1946.&&I like Rami Malek, huge fan of Mr. Robot. Still disappointed that Sacha Baron Cohen isn't doing it anymore, don't remember why. With the stache he looked so much like Mercury.&&One part of me is like ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no"", and another is like ""Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go"".&&Today would have been Freddie's 71st birthday.

*The Mr. Robot star is preparing to play Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody (out Dec. 25, 2018), the Bryan Singer-directed film that chronicles Queen from 1970, when Mercury teamed with Brian May and Roger Taylor, until the band’s performance at Live Aid in 1985, six years before the singer died of complications from AIDS. Malek channels Mer­cury’s look from that global-­concert event. Resembling the legendary musician, he says, “only adds to the level of confidence that one would need to play Freddie Mercury.”*

*The other part of that equation is — of course — that voice.*

*Parts of the movie that feature singing will utilize either Malek’s own voice or recordings of Mercury, with a sound alike filling in the gaps.“We’re going to use Freddie as much as possible and use myself as much as possible,” Malek says.“I’m in Abbey Road [Studios] right now if that should say anything to you. I’m not working on my acting.”*


[Article](http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/05/rami-malek-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody/)&&For those who don't know, [this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0omja1ivpx0) is almost certainly where this still would be based on.&&That jawline could cut glass...&&even though he looks great. Im still sad we didnt get to see the Sasha Baron Cohen version&&Looks great. Still not interested in a story where this band somehow believes the band didn't really die with the singer.&&Dunno what it is, but the pic looks kinda *off*, like very artificial and not real lol&&It looks like an airbrushed poster.&&I'd have preferred the Borat version but this is pretty close.&&I think a trailer is necessary to judge completely, but by the looks of his body language, he's got the essence of Freddie down. He also looks alot like him in make-up, even though there seems to be abit of an airbrushed effect on his face?&&As an Indian it would be cool if they showed his Indian heritage and his childhood. 

My dad went to the same school as him in Bombay. &&Thats gonna take some range. The psychotic computer programmer turned glamour rock god. I love him as an actor. I hope it works. Singer aint no slouch so hopefully this ends up Walk the Line quality. &&Personally I was more hoping they would have gotten [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dREKkAk628I) to do it. he has got the look and the voice to match.&&What happened to Sasha Baron Cohen? I'm out of the loop.&&I still wanted Sasha Baron as Freddy. Rami looks the part at least, can't judge until I see a trailer first! &&[This is the guy who's been cast as Brian May](https://d27o7y1r7mnbwc.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/clients/gwilym-lee/images/gallery/2017-05-25_171319_gwilym_lee_rh_2.jpg). Resemblance is actually very close. &&I'm just sad this isn't Sacha Baron Cohen. Malek looks like he'll nail it but Cohen was literally born for this. &&I absolutely love Rami in Mr. Robot. Honestly wasn't too sure about this when I heard he was going to play Freddie Mercury but after seeing this I have higher hopes.&&[deleted]&&Looking forward to this but the image looks as if the photoshop artist fell asleep on his keyboard. &&Cant wait to see it without photoshop&&[deleted]&&Sacha Baron Cohen would have been better.&&Oh this is going to be directed by Bryan Singer? Guess I'm not gonna go see this. Don't help that pedophile get paid.&&Entertainment Weekly has notoriously bad photographers.

Also still gonna pass because it's Bryan Singer directing.&&im pakistani watching an egyptian play an indian&&Is it me or does that look heavily Photoshop. The lighting looks wierd&&He's missing the bulge.&&now i'm curious to know if freddie mercury was well hung.  i know what i'll be googling after work later&&Exactly what I was thinking, they should have aggressively airbrushed his pants&&And 0 chest hair, Rami a smooth skinned Egyptian. Freddie had a rug you could lay in front of a fireplace&&First thing I thought of: NEEDS MORE BULGE&&Yep I don't know who would choose an actor that can't fill the role. &&That and too little chest hair. &&So, that's also why Sacha made more sense?&&My man&&This guy gets it. &&I'm glad this is the top comment, my immediate thought was how odd it is they de-sexualized him. The bulge was always on display.&&First scene opens with the news of Freddie Mercury passing...the rest of the movie is about the resolve of Brian May to keep touring and making millions despite the tragedy. 5 stars. &&Nobody goes to a Skynyrd show and screams, ""Screw 'Freebird""...I wanna hear *new* stuff...from *after* the plane crash! Whooo!""&&I hope they make the entire story they wanted to tell, but then just cut the 'resurgence of Queen without Freddy' part out at the last minute, pissing off the band but securing the release.
&&The Queen is writing scripts now ? What *can't* she do?!
&&I have a feeling that it'll still be a *good* movie but just not as gritty and truthful as Baron-Cohen wanted it to be. More than likely it'll be a good advertisement for the band and shoot Rami Malek into the A-List. Plus it's Bryan Singer...^^1
____________
 
^^1 *EDIT: The ""plus it's Bryan Singer..."" was meant as a ""don't expect much"" snarky comment*&&>  its hard to get excited

Well, as long as there's *fat bottomed girls*...&&Pretty much. I love Brian May, but he's a stiff. A true biopic has to hit the true story. Sasha Baron Cohen already backed out because of this. Dude does look good but idk how the hell theyre going to replicate that grill. &&Queens side of the story vs. Whos?&&Just playing devil's advocate, there's room for a post Mercury (say 10 min max) story where the rest of the group focus on Freddy's legacy (the AIDS concert, finishing the last album, releasing the videos and previous recordings, We will rock you musical). 

Brian has done a lot of work to keep the Queen name alive and I'd be OK showing some of that. &&Lots a gold in them nip's teeth, we gonna be rich Sledgehammah&&You really need to watch Buster's Mal Heart, then. It just came out on Netflix I think. Saw it at a film festival last year and it was amazing. Definitely my favorite performance I've seen from Malek. &&What kinda marine gets drafted?&&He's amazing as Elliot in Mr. Robot too! &&Glad I'm not the only one who remembers that. He was one of the best parts of the series IMO&&He objected to the story being about how Queen survived after Mercury passed and from what I’ve read the film will be ending around the time they played Live Aid in 85 so looks like the parts he objected to are gone. &&Malek certainly looks more like Mercury than Ben Whishaw who was originally cast (after Baron Cohen left). &&He's got the look, but can he do the voice? Freddie had a very distinctive upper-middle class English accent which would be quite difficult for even a British actor to emulate, let alone an American.

Watch [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wk9hPubD1Q) for an example, and also because it's great in its own right.
&&What's funny is I've seen him before but not sure what from.  Recently I started playing ~~After~~ Until Dawn and he is one of the main characters and I thought that he was the best actor compared to the other characters.  Now I see this pic and I'm kind of excited to see this now.&&Make it big in movies for a while? Excuse me? Did you not see Night at the Museum, Night at the Museum 2, or Night at the Museum 3? How dare you.&&He's also going to be playing [Louis Dega](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5093026/) in the Papillon remake. Charlie Hunnam is playing Steve McQueen's character.&&He is the reason I love Need for Speed. &&His character in Night at the Museum is already very different than his role in Mr Robot&&Have you seen him in The Pacific?  Judging by that, and his character in Mr. Robot, I'd say he has a pretty good range.&&I'm sold on his pose and look already...looking forward to his performance!&&I have no doubt Rami Malek will pull it off.  Even if the story being told isn't what everyone wants, I really think he will knock it out of the park.&&hackerMAN hackerMAN will you overthrow E-Corp?&&Logline is ""A chronicle of the years leading up to Queen's legendary appearance at the Live Aid (1985) concert in 1985"".

So, hopefully, it'll at least be a Freddie, and not a Queen, movie. That said, I highly doubt they're going to tackle things like his aids diagnosis with any real grit. I'm 99% sure this movie will be more of a ""hey! Remeber us?! We're still around, you know?... Oh, and by the way, we're releasing our Greatest Hits album next month if you didn't know"".&&Yes and its directed by Bryan Singer so expect as generic as you can go.&&Bohemian Rhapsody is the story Queen wants to tell.

Don't Stop Me Now should be the real story SBC wants to tell.&&Singer's doing it? Oh. &&Singer probably scrapped them because they didn't involve impressionable 16 year old boy co stars.&&I'd actually love to see a movie about Queen, there's a ton of stuff about their early days that would make great film.

Unfortunately, they wanted to make a movie about stuff no one cares about, instead of focusing on either Freddie, or the band's forming and early struggles.&&that is what the issue was the first time around with Sacha.  He wanted to do an honest portrayal of Freddie, and the other members of Queen wouldn't sign off on some things, so it got scrapped.  Shame.&&> people want a movie about the life of Freddie. 

It almost sounds disrespectful to the band... but it's true. Bryan, Roger and John were crucial to Queen, but Freddie was the star.

He had the personality, the drama, the soul and cheekiness. He was rambunctious, gentle, outrageous and lived in a time where his lifestyle was a scandal - as was his death. He was the key component in Queen. He's the one I want to see.&&I cannot wrap my head around the fact that he would have been 71 today.&&In an interview he said he tried to make the movie but realized Taylor & May wanted to make the second half of the movie about their current career so he bailed.&&> Still disappointed that Sacha Baron Cohen isn't doing it anymore, don't remember why.

Because they wanted to kill off Freddy half way through the movie or something lol&&BEELZEEBUB!&&Fun fact: Queen went through 3 different bassists before John Deacon joined up. Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, and Doug Bogie.

Wonder if they'll be in the film.&&You can literally see the speed of sound in the [crowd's reaction](http://imgur.com/gallery/2iwAd5q) to that performance &&Mine couldn't even cut through water :(&&That's exactly how I feel about this. I'll be checking it out because I love Freddie but I was *so excited* for the way Sasha wanted it to be.&&Well, the band didnt end, but the story people care about did when Freddie died.

People want a gritty, rated R, sex drugs rock-'n'-roll movie with an all Queen soundtrack that is as over the top and amazing as Freddie Mercury's life actually was&&It's been airbrushed pretty aggressively. &&I agree - The image almost looks like a weird 3d render or cartoon - something off about it
to me anyway. &&Well, for starters, that's an actor pretending to be a presently-dead person. &&It's those cheekbones. Definitely. &&I actually thought it was concept art at first.&&it's a dude playin a dude disguised as another dude&&Oh, it's most certainly been modified with filters and other photo manipulations. &&His jawline and profile are pretty heavy and fairly poorly photoshopped.&&Looks like a studio shot comped on a background.  &&photoshopped face&&it looks like those caricatures of freddy that you see at tourist shops&&It´s probably a green screen picture. The background lighting and angle doesn´t match the figure. Also the jawline seems weirdly polished in due to lighting or editing.&&Everything looks spot on to me EXCEPT the jaw line. It's like they airbrushed and then digitally altered the facial hair.&&(not actual gameplay footage) &&Eh posing for a picture is hardly evidence he can channel the spirit of Freddie Mercury. He does look very good but that's all we can take away from this picture.&&It'd be nice if they were accurate with it and showed his birthplace, Zanzibar, as well, considering the Zanzibar uprisings were the reason why his family fled to Great Britain, something that proved to be invaluable for his music career.&&Difference of opinions.

http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/sacha-baron-cohen-explains-departure-from-freddie-mercury-biopic-20160308&&He hated Queens vision for the film (pretty much a story about how Queen ""survived"" Mercury's death) and dropped out. 

I don't blame him, nobody gives a shit about queen nowadays. &&Are you guys 16 years old? &&Thanks for the heads up &&[Here you go lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVIbCvfkO3E)

The entire video is basically a battle between those pants and his dick.&& gonna learn today.
&&While getting his PhD&&Is that really the premise of it?&&Oh great, another Dr. Dre, what are you gonna call your label end of the movie scene.

&&Sasha Baron Cohen's version would start with Freddie Mercury pissing.&&No one from ""Skynyrd"" now is old enough to even know what that means. &&> 'resurgence of Queen without Freddy'

If Oliver Stone's *The Doors* movie hadn't ended with Jim Morrison's death, and instead went on to document the two shitty albums they released afterwards (yes, they did that and, yes, they suck), it would have been a completely anti-climatic movie. 

Shit, why stop there?! Why not keep telling the story about how they reformed a few years later as The Butts Band, and languished in obscurity because the art they were making didn't resonate with people or push any musical boundaries?

You know why Oliver Stone didn't do that? Because it would have been a shitty movie and bad storytelling.

&&Die!&&it will be filled with twinks?&&After watching An Open Secret I think I have to boycott anything Singer is involved in from now on. Amazing (and kind of disgusting) that he's not in jail.&&>Plus it's Bryan Singer

So everything is gonna be monochromatic and the characters will be all wrong? Sounds great... /s Excited to see what Malek can do though.&&Why would we care what Daltrey and Townsend have to say about it?&&Sledgehammah, you don't wanna do dat. Corpsman says the japs got diseases. Bad diseases.


Made me sad he got off in New Orleans and no one was waiting for him and he didn't say goodbye to sledge.&&*See that line of stars angling up? That's Snafu's pecker.*&&Thanks dude, I'll give it a try. You really need to watch The Thick Of It, because everyone does.&&I didn't like it. Love Rami. Just not in that. The pacific was incredible. As was band of brothers although he isnt in it. But donnie wahlburg was excellent in it !&&I'm so glad other people are into that series, feel like it always gets overshadowed by BoB :(&&But yet he didn't just play the part then? Especially if they removed the parts he objected to? &&After Baron Cohen left I sort of lost interest. Not just because he is perfect for the part but also because of the creative disagreements that lead to it. If we aren't going to have a gritty and real portrayal of Freddie's life then I am not really all that into it. &&Wow, I just realized I had no idea what he spoke like. Sounds like a Royal.&&Wow I had no idea he sounded like that. &&If it's anything like the muddled, pseudo-southern bullshit I've had to endure in movie after movie, featuring a veritable army of Aussies and Brits portraying Americans, then no one will seem to mind. &&Mr Robot?&&The Pacific on HBO&&*Until dawn*&&The Pacific?&&The pacific? He was really good that too. &&The Pacific&&...Was there actually a third one of those?&&Ahh, but of course. The 3 pillars of cinema, as I like to call them. 

(The first one was pretty good to be fair)&&That's risky. That's such a good movie. &&That movie wasn't too bad really.  I watched it since it came out about the same time that I finished Breaking Bad and thought sure why not.  I wasn't disappointed in the movie.  But yeah, his character was pretty funny.&&His character in Until Dawn was diff...nah both of them were creepy.
&&That's true. But that was a semi-slapstick comedy that wasn't really driven by wonderful acting performances. I'm interested in seeing Remi play a real character; someone with depth and nuance. &&His character Finn in Need for Speed, as well. Especially the office scene&&Wait who was he again?&&Check out his work in ""The Pacific"" on HBO. He's the real deal.&&[deleted]&&Thunderbolt and lightning

Dongles are frightening me&&Hoo boy, they used the key word ""chronicle"" which in studio suit terms means we open with a dying Freddie on his death bed recounting his life. Closing scene ends with Freddie reaching out to a blinding white light cutting to the beginning of Bohemian Rhapsody at Live Aid. Credits. *""Momma~~""*

Singer seems to love that soppy ending.&&***Another*** one?!? How many ""Greatest Hits"" albums does that make now, 47?&&Fuck.&&[deleted]&&> Bryan Singer 

Well, he did the Usual Suspects, so there is a glimmer of hope.&&I'm woefully uninformed - is there a second film coming out? With SBC? Are they ""Steve Jobs""ing this?&&this is the only reaction. &&For me, it feels *incredibly* unfair that I have lived to be older than Freddie will ever be. He died so young.&&Begs to question are people always immortalized as the age they were at passing.&&Like the majority of the audience will at the half way point &&A movie where they kill off the main character in the middle?  Is this Game of Thrones?&&No, he wanted to do a real life portrayal of freddies life and not the romanticized version the living band members wanted. Obviously, the living band members won because they have the rights to the songs. All queen fans were looking forward to the version SBC had planned which was a real look at the struggles the band faced. Instead, they now get a happy go lucky classic rock band story. Nothing with aids, drugs, or real life problems. Please understand why many queen fans aren't supporting this movie &&HAS A DEVIL SET ASIDE FOR ME!&&Other fun fact that FLOORED me: Queen is the only rock band where every member has written a number 1 single. I mean MAN that's something isn't it. &&This.  He's clearly got that glamour model sheen.&&*Presently* dead?&&It's Entertainment Weekly. Every single ""First Photo!"" they put out looks like absolute shit. We've debated why in many threads here. I think the consensus we came to last time was that they try to adjust the photo to make it look like a still from a color timed film, but it just ends up looking like overprocessed garbage literally every time. &&Yup and that jawline. Too recognizable. &&And lack of chest hair&&Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary. &&Thats how his jawline actually is...&&I can't believe I watched a video with the sole intent of trying to see how well endowed Freddie Mercury was.&&[deleted]&&That's a pickle wrapped in aluminum foil.&&I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen that video and yet never noticed until I looked for it. Yeesh. &&you'd have a bulge too if you wore pants with a short inseam up to your belly button.&&Dressed like most of the habs fans i see&&oh my god&&I have never starred so intently at a dong before.&&I'd be embarrassed to prance around in front of all those people dressed like that. ^^I ^^mean ^^who ^^chooses ^^to ^^wear ^^a ^^Habs ^^hat ^^.. ^^^.. ^^^^?&&Jesus christ that thing is T H I C C&&Jamie Oliver in the front row is mesmerized&&So.... you're telling me that people didn't realize that this man was gay?  With the benefit of hindsight, I find this hard to believe.&&How did he train that squirrel to sit so patiently in his shorts?&&The quality of this video is freaking me out I feel like I'm watching a video from 2017.&&Favourite comment to that video:

*""Freddie Mercury: Not a known giver of fucks.﻿""*&&Yeah, that guy fucked&&Alright alright alriiIIght&&[the ending is him dramatically jotting down the final period in his thesis](#spoiler)&&[deleted]&&That movie was so biased and fucked up. Made Eazy-E look weak and conniving while Dre and Ice Cube were noble men of high moral standard. &&Gary Rossington. &&> Ray Manzarek

Morrison was fantastic as the front man and poet, Manzarek was a brilliant musician.&&The THREE albums The Doors recorded with Manzarek singing are great, IMHO... they were finally able to do what the band had visioned for years. Morrison is, undoubtedly, what attracted me to The Doors, but their growth as musicians is what kept me a fan after becoming a musician... Those three albums are ""The Doors"" sans Morrison being musicians.&&Can we have a shout out as to how amazing Val Kilmer was as Morrison. &&An American Prayer is pretty amazing.&&There are some bands whose stories can't be told just through the lens of the lead singer and most recognizable member. The stories of The Beatles, the Ramones, Husker Du (which is my dream biopic even though it will never happen) would all have to be shown from multiple viewpoints to get the whole picture. Queen is not a band like that. For most people Queen=Freddie, and that's fine, but the filmmakers need to realize that.&&Found Prince Charles' reddit account.&&You better not jinx it like when reddit killed Harper Lee! &&M:
>Where the hell have you been Bond? There's somebody on Reddit disparaging the Queen. Go and take care of it.&&So was Freddie Mercury!&&Well-played.&&Can you elaborate on this? I'm at all familiar with Singer, and I've never watched An Open Secret. &&So in actuality it was a corpsmen who told Sledge not to do that. Sledge feels that that corpsman who stopped him saved the very last shred of humanity he had left. Hoping the Japanese didn't surrender so they could kill all of them was accurate.

If you liked the Pacific I highly recommend reading ""With the Old Breed on Pelelui and Okinawa"" by Eugene Sledge. I got my copy through IBooks and read it on my iPhone.

While Band of Brothers was a great series and often is remarked as superior to the Pacific series, I found
more interest in the Pacific. It really does well in expressing that war is hell.

Remember the Basilone Bale? It was like a large diameter wooden dowel with a hole in a middle. Wire went through the hole that was looped over the barrel of a .30 caliber machine gun so a GI could fire it on the move from the hip without holding the burning hot barrel. I could not really find any evidence of the device actually being used in battle until the other day. I was watching a really good
documentary on the American submarine task force in the pacific. They showed a few black and white clips of jungle infantry combat and there it was: a GI clearing jungle brush with an M1919 fired from the hip using something like the Basilone Bale.&&IMO BOB, The Pacific, and Generation Kill are all tied in quality. Though if I watch one I usually have to watch em all&&I think he left before that stuff was taken out. Maybe even before Singer was involved because he took a bunch of that stuff out apparently. Malek might have already been hired by then.&&Cohen left the file a while ago. He had worked on it for 6 years before he decided to leave. It wasn't like he was just being unreasonable.&&Could be worse, Eddie The Eagle Edwards biopic had an entirely made up coach in the form of Hugh Jackman. I realise Bryan May wants to make more of a Queen biopic that's a feel good film than a warts and all take including all the drugs and wild parties, but that'd be far more interesting to me. &&Totally agree. &&Not just the portrayal of Freddie, they wanted his death to be like halfway through and the rest be about the band carrying on. &&I'm hoping we'll still get a Freddie-centric movie (like Cohen was talking about). We got something like four Steve Jobs movies so it *could* happen, just probably not as soon as we'd all like.&&Totally agree; I want an honest portrayal and think it would've been the role of a lifetime for him. I feel bad for the dude and give him mad props for having the guts to walk away.&&PG Freddy isn't that great of an idea.&&As in Sasha Baron Cohen?!?&&I'm sure Baron Cohen would have been amazing . It would have been a break out role for him. He would have won awards.&&This was the first time I've heard his speaking voice. Didn't sound like what I guess I expected it to, but it's nice. I like his accent. &&Same here.  So weird, I've listened to him sing for hundreds of cumulative hours throughout my life but I'd never heard him speak before. &&well he is a queen&&Sounds like a queen. &&I've never seen Mr Robot, so not that.  Just looked him up on IMDB and it must have been Need For Speed.

He also has one of those very distinguishable faces, so I could have recognized him from promotions as well&&[deleted]&&oops, my bad&&wasn't it the last movie robin williams was in? &&Yes. It was called ""Secret of the Tomb"". The power of the tablet runs out... so they go to the UK! &&I knew what I was signing up for when I went to see it. It was pretty much what I expected. His character definitely helped make the movie a bit more fun to watch. &&I always felt sorry for Josh. He got it bad, and he's the only one of them that can't get a good ending (not counting his sisters)&&Oh shit, yeah, that was Rami Malek! 

Huh. Crazy that I've seen this guy a bunch before Mr. Robot and never even realized until this thread.&&Oh, that comment was meant more as a joke. Your point is fully valid.&&You should see him in the game Until Dawn for PS4&&[deleted]&&Sort of. But he's a quiet anxious dude in Mr. Robot. In the pacific he's more of a mysterious ball buster. &&More like a guy who had seen enough shit between Pelieliu and Okinawa to not have a lot of humanity left.

Thought Rami did a great job with Snafu Shelton. 

I'd highly recommend reading Eugene Sledge's ""With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa"" - the descriptions of Snafu are interesting to say the least.&&Christian Slater! **Christian Slater**&&Saving this just so I can come back to it and laugh at how right you were.&&I think he might have it set after Freddie returns from visiting the ruins of Mercury, only to discover his love is with someone else and raising a child who displays some abilities very similar to his own.
&&At least the soundtrack will be kick ass. &&Over 20 years ago..&&No, Queen is the only one with Freddy's life rights. Originally Sacha was casted as Freddy and was on to help write the script. He then left because Queen wanted the movie to be more about the band as a whole, where Freddy would die either in the middle or at the end of the second act. The rest would be a triumphant telling of how they moved on. On top of that they wanted to leave out or censor almost all the behind scenes things happening to Freddy like his affairs, drug abuse, or going into detail about his AIDS diagnosis. Sacha wanted to do a real Freddy biopic, Queen wanted a Disney story about the band. So he left the project permanently.

Also for /u/StarDestinyGuy &&> No, he wanted to do a real life portrayal of freddies life and not the romanticized version the living band members wanted.

I know he wanted to do that, but they did also want to kill him off halfway through the movie and that was a big hangup for him as well.&&Not just that either! Every single member of Queen has written at *least* **THREE** number ones, making them the only band in the world where every member is in the songwriter's hall of fame.&&For now.&&Well, he was previously alive.&&EW, indeed. &&I, a straight male, just watched a 4 minute video while watching nothing but Freddy Mercury's crotch. And that's what my life has become &&There is no shame is longing for Freddy's penis &&He'd be happy to know &&To be honest it looks like he's pulled the crutch of his tight shorts to one side of his junk...&&Fuck. Me. Reddit takes us to the weirdest places sometimes &&It's hypnotic. &&That's what I was thinking literally the entire video... ""So you're telling me there were people who *didn't* know he was gay?""&&Well yeah, he was bisexual &&Same for George Michael, like i see him in the careless whisper or wake me up before you go go music videos and think, ""his hair looks pretty gay, even for the 80's""&&The 80s were weird man&&He was bi, not gay, so the public was correct.&&Wasn't he bisexual?&&I don't know about you but I just see raw masculinity, like Sean Connery in Zardoz. Nothing inherently gay about it.

Edit: [There's something gay about the questions going through this audience member's head though](https://youtu.be/NVIbCvfkO3E?t=187)&&Not that amazing... Have you never seen a video of a rock band from the 70s or 80s? That was all pretty standard stuff.&&Probably because he fucked his fair share of women too&&/r/unexpectedspinaltap&&How'd you not see it? His weiner takes up half the fucking frame &&Where else would one look during that video? The Canadiens logo on his hat?
&&And if you had a massive dong&&Yeah haha, totally.&&I was going to dispute this but i can't really remember the last time i wore pants.

Arabian Prince was completely written out, even though he's on the Straight Outa Compton album cover. MC Ren and DJ Yella got treated like unwanted step children. 

Jerry wasn't portrayed as unfavorably as I figured he would have been. And there were more pro Dre and Cube/anti Eazy undertones for sure. Just because you pretend you don't beat the shit out of women doesn't mean people forgot about (that) Dre. 

But you know what they say, history is written by the victors/band mates that aren't dead. &&Maybe a little rough on Eazy, but the casting was spot on, the sequences were well done, and they captured the tone of the time and location about as perfectly as they could without being John Singleton&&History is written by the victors&&Not to mention glossing over the fact that Dre ~~slapped~~ beat the shit out of Dee Barnes&&I wasnt surprised at all.

The band who hold all the rights to the song wanted a pg movie. Ultimately you can't have a behind the music movie without the music so the film makers sided with the band. Honestly a bummer to me 

Edit: Not gay, he was bisexual and not in the closet. Cohen's version would still be superior to what they are making I belive.&&Could be even worse than that. They created the main character for Birth of a Dragon and made Bruce Lee a supporting character in his own movie.&&It's funny because I went into Eddie the eagle with no background info and ended up loving.

Maybe he wouldn't care, I don't know. No one does. I was just sharing my opinion, not stating a fact. Calm down everyone.

Edit: I'm not really sure how ""he wouldn't have wanted a movie made"" is an answer to my question of which version he would prefer.&&as a Bruce Lee fan this royally pissed me off when I saw that first trailer. months later they recut the trailer but the damage has been done&&Dude.

We need a movie that follows the creation of the album Electric Ladyland, and the Band of Gypsys&&I remember hearing a few years ago, probably 10 or more, that Steven Seagal wanted to do a Hendrix biopic and star in it as Jimi as well.

Jamie Foxx embodied him beautifully and the film seemed to be a fairly honest portrayal of a flawed human being.&&Walk the Line is a great romanticization of the love between Johnny Cash and June Carter, but for a strictly Cash biopic it falls flat. I have like 2 major issues with Walk the Line. One is that a lot of stuff was out of order in terms of dates (ie. Cash recording I Walk the Line well past 1956, June appearing to write Ring of Fire in 1965, and Cash appearing to have disappeared from the music scene between 1965-1968 which is completely wrong).

Another thing is they really missed out on a lot of super interesting stuff that could have bolstered his redemption story like his apparent suicide attempt in '67, or how he would disappear in the desert without telling anybody, and also the vulture incident.&&Brian May is a fantastic guitarist, but fantastic guitarists are a dime a dozen. What made Freddie special and by extension Queen was that he was the trifecta of a brilliant songwriter, performer, and recording artist. Yes May et al wrote a lot of popular songs but Freddie's performance sold them.&&RemindMe! 10 years&&The main thing I remember about his character in The Pacific was when he was tossing pebbles in to the open head of a Japanese soldier on Peleliu.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bZ2CiACbmM&&It took me a while but I grew to like it more than BoB, personally. Although BoB had the better plotline, The Pacific has fewer characters, which means you get more attached to the quirks and unique personalities of each one over the course of the series. In BoB it felt like they just threw the entire regiment at you and expected you to learn their stories in a relatively short period.&&It's good but in a very different way than BoB. 

BoB is more linear and easier,  follows the same company with a clear objective. I think Pacific captures the effects of war on people better,  but the story is more scattered. &&Yes. I always tell people to watch the Pacific before BoB if they haven't seen either, but yes Pacific is absolutely worth the watch. &&Oh interesting! Thanks for clearing it up. I know there is a trophy for everyone else surviving but it must not account for Josh. &&I'd argue that's be the bad ending for him. Death is preferable to an irreversible possession and painful transformation into a monster &&He's just an emo boy, rebellion is his energy

**He's just an emo boy, but his dad is dead you see!**&&The Beatles are always in my book as the best band ever by default for their influence in changing the game, but Queen sure as fuck give them a run for their money. Queen is universally loved. You don't see lots of people saying that Queen is overrated. They have so many facts that just amaze me too. Like how We are the Champions and We Will Rock You, two stadium anthems virtually known everywhere, WERE ON THE SAME SINGLE. I MEAN HOW FUCKING AWESOME IS THAT. &&That's too perfect, holy shit.&&Rated R for Rad as fuck&&Boners from *beyond the grave!*&&Oh for reals? I didn't know that. Thanks for letting me know. I did just look it up and it seems that you are correct. 

I hope the films includes the fact that he was a bisexual as they don't get a lot of coverage, especially bisexual men. A lot of people just think gay or straight, one or the other. And lot of people seem to associate bisexuality more with women than men. 

Obviously it would have been a huge part of his identity and I hope that they portray that properly as sexuality is an important part of who someone is. It needs to be represented for both Freddies legacy and also for other bisexual people who are underrepresented in society. 

Wasn't meaning to turn this political but I am a huge LGBTQI ally and I think having role models in the public domain really help people who are discovering their sexuality to be confident and proud of who they are. Due to this I think it would be a shame for that not to play an important part in the film, as it clearly did in his life - especially in the era where homosexuality and bisexuality was a lot less accepted than it is now. 

Also I can now live life happy to stare at his bulge and thing that in alternative universe I would have maybe had a chance 😉&&[deleted]&&How could such a thing be wrong. It's just some sorta (un)natural attraction the man had.

Freddie wasn't actually gay, he just ran out of women to fuck.&&What the hell! I mean, women loved him&&[deleted]&&> Freddy was king of the world and he knew it

Thing is, Freddie was one of those guys who could devour any stage you put him on, but who - by all accounts - was remarkably reticent and withdrawn, even shy, in person. Some people are more comfortable in front of a crowd of ten thousand than with a couple of friends. &&>The voice?

[Try this guy on for size.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dREKkAk628I) &&Sacha can sing like a mofo iirc.&&I'm with you on the voice, I don't know anyone that could pull it off. I wonder if Malek will be singing, or if they will use recordings of Mercury&&Surprising facts about him:

He's pretty dapper when not dressed up like a weirdo for his roles

He graduated from University of Cambridge 

He used to be a fashion model

His wife is Isla Fisher


So if someone only knows him from Borat, then they're getting a very small slice of what he's actually like.&&I'm mostly referring to scenes like when he came out of the studio when the cops were harassing NWA, he wasn't an asshole or careless or anything negative. They didn't really have to have him in that scene at all. Maybe that was their intent, like ""hey, see? We don't hate Jerry"" and make *themselves* seem more sympathetic, but that seems like a stretch.&&Synonym's just another word for, the word you want to use. 

EDIT: I can't type/&&This will get buried, but I'm gonna put in my two cents anyway. I think a great version of Mercury's story would be one that followed his perspective entirely, one in which you never actually see his face except when he's safely behind the walls of his estate or in the studio working on his music, just he and the band. He was always very self-conscious of his smile, growing the mustache to hide his teeth, and intensely private, his stage persona becoming almost a split personality for him. Whether it bothers with his party life or explores his relationships and how they were affected by his party life is inconsequential next to why he chose those particular avenues. The most fascinating aspect of his life is that he left everything to his one-time girlfriend Mary Austin, a relationship that honestly deserves its own movie. He said she was the only person that ever really knew him. The evolution of their sound and the many different directions it took it is worth a look, but from Mercury's perspective and through Mercury's eyes. 

Also, the name is rubbish. The only thing a Freddie Mercury biopic should ever be called is READY FREDDY. &&Meow the Jewels : The Movie.&&He didn't even like doing interviews. Im sure he wouldn't have backed a movie about him at all, especially one where it's ultra sanitized and whose concern is about glamorizing the band.&&I think that would have put too much toll on Dano, he already committed so much and it was probably better for his performance to stay in the past. I do agree Cuscak kinda dropped the ball but compared to Dano in that film anyone would be second-rate.&&Because Brian became a complete different person after the onset of his sickness, so they got two actors, focusing on the different Brians, so one wouldn't spill into the other.&&What? I thought Cusack was awesome. The whole cast was awesome! &&*synonym's just another word for a word you want to use*&&Legal changed it to ""Janie Jiplin.""&&I'm so glad I never bothered watching it. &&Which is a shame. I think Andre 3000 was perfect casting. &&Sounds like classic Steven segal. ""I'm a master at guitar, blues, aikido, movies, being a cop, a deity, and now a black guy""&&Yeah. After sitting through two hours of them vilifying Eazy E, I couldn't believe they had the nerve to dedicate the movie to him. &&It was still a good movie though.&&You know what's funny? Your whole paragraph with the first sentence changed is even *more* true IMO:

>I hated **The Defiant Ones**. ~~Both Ice Cube and Dr. Dre we're on as producers, so~~ it was basically a fluff piece that conveniently omitted all the terrible parts of their lives and made them always seem like the good guys. The ending might as well have had Dre turn into superman and save the world. &&I couldn't believe it, I went in expecting this great, hard hitting biopic and it was one of the cheesiest ones I've seen in a long time. I laughed out loud too many times for a serious movie.&&**SPARE HIM A FATE WITHOUT F-SOCIETY!!**&&Boners without Borders&&Very well put and you're right on all counts. I'm a bisexual man and you're dead on when it comes to representation of bisexuals in the media. Of course back then there were famous people who faked being in relationships with the opposite sex but we're actually gay. But that really doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to Freddie, all signs point to him being bi.

I also hope the movie covers his sexuality and doesn't just have it be a quick part that covers him as gay. But yeah, representation is a big deal esspecially to LGBT+ teens. I was a teenager in the 90's trying to figure it all out, hating myself along the way and it was confusing as fuck. So much of media and society was reducing bisexuals to people who just couldn't admit they were gay. Will & Grace was a good show at the time but I don't even think they ever had a bisexual character pop up for instance.

So I would be attracted to men but keep coming back to the fact that I was attracted to women too. I would go back and forth thinking there was no way I could be gay since I like girls and then I would think I was gay and only liked girls because of society. I would also hate on myself and beat myself up for even being attracted to men in the first place. It was a bit of a stressful time to say the least. I actually ended up coming out twice to my family, first as gay and then a year later as bisexual.

Thanks for being an ally, we need all the help we can get. And you stare at that bulge and dream to your hearts content!&&I don't think there's a name for what Freddie was. I don't think Bi would cover it. He'd fuck anybody and oozed intense sexuality from every pore.

Even if someone didn't want to openly admit how badly they wanted to fuck him, they'd admit they wished they were him. &&I'm happy with it being a thing if it gets people to watch/read the original, but I agree, it wasn't that great and missed the characters completely&&Indeed. He could frequently be seen hiding his teeth/overbite while giving interviews. He let loose whenever and wherever he performed, but he was not wholly unrestrained or without any degree of self-consciousness all the time.&&I've felt more at home on stage in front of strangers, than in my actual home with my family. A lot of people don't get this, but it's absolutely true.&&Cocaine*&&I'm not entirely convinced this isn't just lip-syncing.  Holy shit.&&That guy's good, holy shit.

I also just learned that Queen is touring with Adam Lambert and [oh my god, it's dog shit](https://youtu.be/DUef6VzJJw8?t=1m10s).&&Holy shit, he's even got the same jawline. This guy is amazing.&&Wasn't Dano so good in There Will Be Blood that they punted the guy who was supposed to play the preacher and had Dano play both parts now rewritten as twin brothers? I think he only had a couple days to prepare for the much larger part and he murdered it. That guy is crazy talented. 

I think I also saw an interview with Tarantino where he pissed on Dano's performance in that movie. Baloney! &&God, I can't even imagine what Dano would have had to go through mentally if he was asked to play both versions of Brian Wilson. That would so mentally exhausting I'd want to just sit in a white room for 2 years to decompress.&&*Take another little chunk of my lung now babay*&&Who could forget Jaundice Chaplin's legendary performances of 'Me And Tommy McKee' and 'Peace In My Heart'.&&It was a good first half of a movie. The second half felt like they took a bunch of notable events from everyone's life and threw them together even if they didn't really fit well.&&it's a decent fiction movie. I wonder if there'll be a sequel to the factual events though.&&True, but there is a big distinction to be made between a good movie, and a good, accurate portrayal of the historical events surrounding an iconic individual, which is what a biopic should be. Very few biopics are both unfortunately.&&They did briefly address the Dee Barnes issue, but totally copped out on it and made it seem like some honest mistake. 

I thought it was actually really good until the last episode, which was basically an hour long Beats commercial. &&I was okay with The Defiant Ones as an overview for all the projects they had going on.  But the final installment was basically a 45 minute advertisement for Beats by Dre, and Apple Music.

That's where they lost me. &&Except in that one he actually addressed the Dee Barnes incident, which doesnt exactly make him look like a superhero.&&Bitcoin come, Bitcoin go, will you let him hack?&&This is the kind of humanitarian aid that you can get behind. &&I'm incredibly pleased to hear my comment came out as intended as I have a habit of rambling and missing the point altogether.

But I do believe that even now a lot of society still views bisexuality as mainly for women and like you said, as a gay man who can't or won't accept who they are. When the reality of that is certainly not the case.

I can't even imagine the struggles you went through trying to form your own identity when you had no representation to help you work out what was going on or to understand who you were. And like you said, even in shows etc that had gay characters, bisexuality is usually only referred to as being ""a phase"" someone had at some point in their lives, which is ridiculous.

I live in Australia and we're currently about to have a postal vote on the topic of same sex marriage. I am all for it, but the postal vote has been an awful way to go about it. It's given idiots a platform to spew their hatred. And even sensible people who I would think would support it have been making idiotic statements like ""why does it have to be marriage, why not a civil union"". I hate to think of the effect that this is having on the younger generations who are struggling with their identity. Love is love, why is that so hard to understand? The government has no right to state how two consenting adults who want to spend their lives together are able to do so. It's utter nonsense. 

I am thrilled to hear that you have found your identity and I hope that things like this film will portray Freddie as a role model for those who are in a similar situation to how you once were. He was loved because of who he was and what he did, not because of who he loved. And it was a time where the LGBT+ community weren't as accepted and must have been incredibly difficult for him, especially being in the spotlight as he was.

I can't imagine the struggles you have been through. I never had to come out to my family or anyone else as straight so I find it absurd that anyone else has to. Once would be difficult, so I cant even imagine how hard twice must have been. But it sounds like they love you for you which is incredibly important for your own sense of self and happiness. But it's also people like you that have paved the way for the younger generation to find their identity and love themselves for it. As I said earlier, love is love.

As a brown person it means a lot to me that people like me are represented in society and in the media now as they never were when I was growing up and I struggled with who I was because of that. I think it's equally as important for all 'minorities' in society to have representation. But I truely hope they use this opportunity to tell his story to those who don't know it. I know and like queen and I didn't know he was bisexual. So let's shout it to the world and give you the representation you very clearly deserve in the world.

Keep on keeping on my friend 💕

Edit - I tried to stop my rambling. Didn't succeed 🤷🏽‍♀️&&It didn't miss L, who was literally the only good thing about that movie.&&That sounds like a perfect character to be played by either Rami Malek or Sacha Baron Cohen&&There was speculation that his unique vocals were attributed to his heavy overbite&&Shh, we aren't talking about there mountains of coke that they were doing. That's not the Queen story they want to tell..&&Nope. He's the [real deal](https://youtu.be/GQ0H7tZ_tZs). I think this video is more impressive, because you can see the dedication he's made to really studying Freddie's voice. He's not just doing an impression.&&The whole video thats all i was trying to figure out. If its lip syncing, its the best ive ever seen. Even better than journeys new singer.&&I would be so disappointed if I went to a Queen concert and that monstrosity came out with none of the true natural flair and extravagance that Freddie Mercury had, but just this paltry attempt at matching it. Then there's Brian May in a... green t-shirt?

Seriously, Lambert just stands in the same spot the whole time. Freddie would have been grinding on his bandmates, jumping around, rousing the crowd into a frenzy.

Just so sad to see one of my favorite bands reduced to this ghost of a shadow of what it once was.&&Pissed on Dano's performance?

Huh, I don't remember that. I thought he said something to the effect of ""his performance was great but compared to DDL is was just 'good enough'"" or something.

edit: I just want to add - There Will Be Blood was the best movie of an *insane* year for great films. 2007. TWBB is a goddamn masterpiece, Dano is fucking brilliant and DDL was just... I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. The film is brilliant, I would dare to say it is perfect, flawless.&&Dude I personally think Dano is slowly becoming one of the best in the business. His career has a long way to go before he peaks. His role in Prisoners was amazing.&&Tarantino basically has shit opinions 90% of the time on other entertainment. He loooooves to talk shit. I feel like he feels threatened or something. 

I thought what happened in TWBB was that the actor who was going to play his brother ended up dropping out and they decided to just make the brothers twins so Dano could do both, but I'm not 100% sure about that. Added a nice surreal element to it regardless though, I like that the brothers were twins.&&If I remember right, the issue in There Were Be Blood was that the other actor wasn't working out, not primarily that Paul Dano was so good.&&They didn't punt the other guy, Daniel Day-Lewis scared the shit out of him and he quit. &&No, the guy Dano plays was originally scared of DDL and left so Dano got promoted.&&_we're all here at Woodstocks.. someday there'll be a black president_&&CB4?&&Yeah I was hoping for a much longer segment focused on Eminems rise to fame. Instead we got like 10 minutes of him and like 25 minutes of fuckin Beats.&&Yeah, that's exactly my take: They should have dropped the final episode. It served no purpose except to say ""now, look how much money Dre made with just branding and marketing!"" Beats headphones didn't make the world a better place, or even provide a quality product (compared to what else is available for the price). 

Maybe it's because I already knew a lot of the Dre story, but I thought the Jimmy Iovine half was much more interesting as well. He might be a billionaire music exec, but he seems like the real deal, as someone who worked his way up and cared about the music.&&",2017-09-05 16:03:35

He has already filmed Hard Powder, in which he plays a snowplough driver who faces off with drug dealers.""

At least he's going out on a high. &&I really like the Liam Neeson action movies but I respect his decision. Neeson was one of the few people that were consistently starring in ""middle budget"" movies that people say we never get.&&[deleted]&&Of course he has. He has no family members left.&&Is he going to do [Improv comedies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ81Mq2y34) instead?&&Hopefully he'll return to drama movies again. He was great in Silence and I'd like to see him in that kind of role again.&&The Grey will haunt me for a long time. There was a pretty physical side to that role despite being a thriller / drama film, I hope he doesn't move away from work like that. &&Oh no!

He's going to lose a particular set of skills.&&He's Qui-Gone Jinn&&The guy is 65. Unlike Stallone and Schwarzenegger, he knows when to quit lol&&[deleted]&&As much as I love Liam Neeson and how good he is in action movies (Taken and The Grey are awesome) I'm glad he's making this decision.  I want to see him get back to playing roles like Oskar Schindler. &&Let's all observe a moment of silence for the legendary scene from Taken 3 where twelve ~~jump~~ cuts were needed to show Liam Neeson crawling over a garden fence.

https://youtu.be/gCKhktcbfQM&&He says that now, but wait till someone kidnaps his daughter&&Darkman was the first movie I recall seeing him in&&Taken and The Grey were great, I also loved The A Team but he's a talented actor it's probably time he moved on anyway. &&Looks like he's found and killed everyone&&Hopefully we get more some more cameos like Ted 2. 

Scene: https://youtube.com/watch?v=PL7IoRjVHJQ&&Glad he's making way for Courtney Portnoy to take over the franchise&&I respect that he knows when to call it quits, whether it was for physical reasons or creative reasons.


We've had almost 10 years of these films from him and it was a fun ride but I'm happy it's over. You don't want to get stuck in a rut making the same kind of films for too long. He may have given us 1 (or 2, honestly) too many Taken movies but overall he made a lot of great and fun action movies in this time. My personal favourite was probably a Walk Among the Tombstones.&&I hear its so he can focus on his [improv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ81Mq2y34)&&I'd love to get at least a cameo out of him in John Wick 3. 

All we need is for him to show up and send a few assassins immediately running away, saving John. No action involved. &&Likely due to his being riddled with AIDS. &&I guess he finally got too old for that shit&&I read to fast and thought he was retiring from acting overall.

That would have ruined my day.

Liam Neesons is my shit.

&&I thought he was switching to comedy. I mean, he is a funny guy after all.&&Alternate headline: Liam Neeson soon to be paid more than ever for action films.&&This is good news IMHO, Neeson is a brilliant actor, so its a waste to use his career time growling down the phone at drug cartels all the time. Hopefully hell be in some good proper acting roles.&&Excellent. Hopefully we'll see him in more varied fare. He succeeded spectacularly as an action hero (admittedly haven't seen any of those films), so I hope his return to dramatic roles is as successful too.&&[deleted]&&It makes sense, the Naked Gun series is pretty old already. Unless he was able to reunite with OJ Simpson, it's probably not worth it. &&Yeah this'll last until Taken 4.&&He is now going to do improvisational comedy. He has AIDS.&&Just action movies right? I need that voice in some dramas stat&&Because he has AIDS.&&Should've been in one of The Expendables.&&Can we just get 1 movie with Sean Bean and Liam Neeson together, where Bean is about to die in each scene and Neeson saves him?  It'd be like the movie industry imploding on itself because Bean dies in almost every movie and Neeson saves the day in almost every movie!&&I'll miss that action persona&&You mean he won't be in the next expendables movie?&&""[Neeson] has already filmed Hard Powder, in which he plays a snowplough driver who faces off with drug dealers.""

Sign me the fuck up!&&Liam Neeson announces salary negotiation for action films&&Taken: A Break &&Looks like he's learned to do what is necessary.&&When we gettin' that Krull sequel? Its fantasy, not Action!&&Dude is 6'4, and 65 years old.  I'm not 40 yet and the thought of doing half the shit he does makes me ache. &&I'd like to see him in more movies like 'The Grey'. Wasn't an action movie, but it was damn good.&&Good, I stopped seeing his films anyway. You can't make millions glorifying violence and at the same time tell Americans they shouldn't own firearms. &&*Original taken pun*&&He's getting into porn. &&The article is a little wrong. His action debut started quite a bit earlier than Taken (1990)  The first action film I remember him starring in was Dark Man.  (He was in Krull and Excalibur way before that in smaller roles.)&&Thats one sure fire way to get your daughter kidnapped: be Liam neeson and announce your ""retirement from action""?


...we'll see about THAT buddy boy.

...nnnnYOINK!&&Damn, Liam Neesons was my shiit...&&...Until one day, he's called back into the game for ONE. LAST. JOB.&&If Stallone and Schwarzenegger can keep making action films, so can he.&&NO&&pffff&&I hope this doesn't apply to Star Wars as I'd love for him to come back as Qui-Gon Jin (either via flashback, Prequel or force ghost) in a future Star Wars film. 

Could be cool to see him acting as a sprit guide of sorts to Obi-Wan in the planned Obi-Wan film. 

And I'd love to see him take a supporting role in a Marvel or DC film in the future, perhaps giving him a second shot at Zeus in Wonder Woman 2? He was perfect as Zeus in Clash of the Titans. &&ok&&Now he can finally start work on his masterpiece, Trix Are For Kids. &&He learned to be one with the Force.&&until someone kidnaps his daughter, then it's on.&&> He has already filmed Hard Powder, in which he plays a snowplough driver who faces off with drug dealers.  
  
Yes, I think it's time...&&Aw man I always held a secret hope for a sequel to a walk among the tombstones &&I will look for you, I will find you and I will...have a

 nice cup of coffee with you..&&Kinsey is one of my favourite roles by him, hope he does more movies like that. &&Watching after your daughter is a full time job.&&He looks so good for 65!&&He's lined his retirement nest very very well, and deservedly so!

I'd be open to more of that.&&Well, he's gone on record as saying that after his wife died, he buried himself in his work, so it's not surprising he accepted many parts other actors of his calibre would consider ""below"" themselves.

I'm guessing this decision has as much to do with him getting older as it does with him maybe finally feeling like he can move on...&&but we don't get those.

Is this a written script, or is it like a 'meta' improv comedy, where they're improvising a 'terrible improv comedy audition' ?&&Was kind of surprised he did so many action movies recently.

He's a really great actor and I understand why he's been keeping busy with action films, but I'm looking forward to what's next. &&I definitely don't think that was an action film, I assume he's talking about Taken, Run All Night, etc. The Grey was fantastic, and he was incredible in it.&&One of my favorite movies of all time, just incredible beginning to end.

The Taken-style movies are definitely a bit limiting, especially if that's basically all you're doing.

I'd say his age is pretty much the main factor. At some point you'd have to begin relying too much on effects or stunt doubles.

^^^^Please ^^^^don't ^^^^hate ^^^^me&&Isn't that kind of the underlying theme of The Grey?&&Sounds like a pretty badass remake of The Seventh Seal. I can picture him clobbering Death with a heavy wooden chessboard.&&I enjoyed The Grey.  It was a aiming a bit high in terms of artsy stuff (Yeah yeah, appropriate poetry we get it) but there's something to be said about a good old fashioned man vs nature story.&&The entire Taken series was because of money. He got $20mil for Taken 3. The other action movies like Non-Stop and The Grey were to distract himself after Natasha died.&&Thoughts and prayers.&&Well yeah, that's why Spielberg cast him. Everyone knows that.&&I don't think you should let your sexuality hold you back from doing improv, as long as you can find the right team to practice with.&&You should do improv porn.&&The funny thing about Taken was he thought it was going to be a straight to DVD film when he first signed on. Then it arguably made him one of the most well-known action stars of the last decade.&&You mean the last 15 years &&That was such a heavy film to watch. I felt so emotionally drained and tired after watching it.&&This is my main concern with Indiana Jones 5, Harrison Ford will be nearly 80 when they film it.&&Hopefully he occasionally still takes Mike Ehrmantraut type roles:
old, knows they are old, but still badass.

Often it is the calm non action of a professional that is more fun for the viewer than shaky cam 0.2 second cut screen action.&&Like this?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gCKhktcbfQM&&That's fair. Some people might be bummed because they're fans of his work...but you'd be hard pressed to get those same people to imagine their own grandfather's in those action hero roles. I look forward to seeing Liam Neeson in more roles where he's sitting on porches sipping lemonade and eating werther's originals.&&Th Grey is one of those movies that is so good, and leaves such a strong and harrowing impression, that I have never watched it again. I never could have imagined what that movie would be, based on the first announcement. Absolutely fantastic, yet completely emotionally exhausting. That death scene, together with Wade's death in Saving Private Ryan, is the most difficult to watch of any movie I have seen. Not to mention at the end when that guy drowns under a few inches of water. Fuck. Brilliant and insanely emotionally intense movie.&&Yes, but the films not really about surviving, it's about coming to terms with your own mortality and the mortality of others, the wolves are more of a metaphor. There's a theory that the people all die in the plane crash, then suffer in purgatory until they explore their situations. The whole film is about characters coming to terms with their issues and then dying. Liam Neeson's character himself considers suicide at the start of the film, but he hears a wolf howl and stops, the wolf literally calls him to continue, to learn about himself and to help the others.

It's why I didn't like the advertising, and it's why I find it frustrating that people I know that like wolves were upset that they were 'inaccurate and overly violent', sure, but they're a representation of fear and death, they should be scary and violent. The film isn't 'taken with wolves', which was a lot of people's complaint, but it's so much deeper and more thoughtful than it would have been if it was just that.&&No matter where you are, he will entertain you.&&He could appear as a force ghost in the Obi-Wan film, which could potentially take place before Rogue One, thus making it a prequel to a prequel.&&But he is the same age now that Qui Gon was supposed to have been at death. &&Oh shit, I completely forgot about that.

>But if Neeson declined to level criticism specifically at the Phantom Menace, his co-star Ewan McGregor was less circumspect: **_'It was the most boring film to make so complex with all the special effects. No spontaneity; everything was so deliberate. Your job as an actor was just to get it out.'_**  

George just wanted to _""get it out""_ of the actors and fix everything in post.

> In a separate interview Sunday, **Lucas** sympathized with **Neeson’s** complaint: **_”(Film) is a director's medium, there's no question about that. Once an actor goes on stage, he's pretty much free to do whatever he wants. But in film, you can change the performance through the editing process and hopefully make it better.”_**

George Lucas just wanted to have the actors like ""puppets"" say their lines, and do the basic script, so he could mess with it in post production.

I'll never get over the dangling hair scene and the cuts that surround it. &&It's sad how criminally underrated The Grey is. Most of it is due to people taking the film at face value. On the surface we see a movie about a group of men trying to survive vs. cold and wolves after a plane crash. Underneath the ""Liam Neeson fighting stuff"" facade we have an artistic piece on the tragedy of losing a loved one, and the toll it takes emotionally and spiritually. It's full of metaphors, allegory, and introspective analysis on death and the soul.

To me I saw it as a movie about wrestling himself back from the despair and depression he lived with after her death, to find that he wasn't ready to roll over and accept his own.

David Harbour as Hellboy (2018),58915,6zx74t,https://i.redd.it/r5f1inrljplz.jpg,3029,1505333431.0,,"[Another image of Harbour as Hellboy.](https://i.imgur.com/NjSqAtl.jpg)&&How does this still look like ron perlman?&&You sure that's not Ron Perlman?&&he's bringing some serious physicality to the role&&I'm glad they didn't do something crazy to try and go another direction with it. This is what Hellboy should look like IMO.&&Looks much more similar to Perlman's Hellboy than I would have thought. 

That said, I actually like the longer hair.&&New Image: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJodRG2WsAEl4p-.jpg&&Looks like a ""de-aged via CGI"" version of Ron Perlman.

I'm stoked to see what Harbour can bring to the role. It's only one picture, but he remains close enough to what I think Hellboy should look like. Similarities aside, it's still very exciting.&&TIL - In mid 2012, Ron Perlman once again endured the 4-hour makeup routine required to transform him into Hellboy - not for a sequel or other acting job but to fulfill the Make-A-Wish request of a six-year-old boy named Zachary who has leukemia. Creature effects house Spectral Motion, who had worked on the two previous Hellboy films, applied Perlman's Hellboy makeup (and later, also made up Zachary as Hellboy as well), so that Zachary could spend the day hanging out with his favorite superhero. Guillermo del Toro was so touched by this event that it inspired him to start production on Hellboy 3. However, the project was announced to be cancelled and this reboot's development started soon after.&&[Here’s](https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hellboy-david-harbour.jpg) a higher quality image of Hellboy in case you guys wanted to see some of the smaller details. &&I won't lie--doesn't look that different from Ron Pearlman's  Hellboy.&&Hope the film can in some way incorporate Mignola's style. 

Not sure how it can be done without going full Dick Tracy and seeing as it's not animation, but I would still like it.&&Of course he looks like Perlman - they both look like classic Hellboy! This one looks like he has a bit more edge, tho - he looks leaner/meaner, not like Perlman's lovable Big Red. &&So Ron Perlman is playing David Harbour playing Hellboy? 

He's a dude playing another dude, Disguised as another dude. &&Just a testament to how much Del Toro got the look right. I wish this was a continuation of the trilogy/saga/whatever instead of a reboot. High hopes regardless&&I don't know what I expected, some dramatic difference maybe? You slap an actor in makeup to look like Hellboy, that's what you're gonna look like. And you're gonna look similar to Perlman. 

He looks great.

He could wear the best tired scowl. &&I think that this is a photo from that day https://imgur.com/v6eDKrN&&That would have been really awkward if something went wrong and that child passed away with Ron Perlman at his bedside dressed like the devil. &&Please tell me that leukemia kid is still alive&&damn, that's great work by the costume/makeup department. A lot of finer details for sure&&Muscle suits will completely overtake actors needing to workout ever again. That is one impressive looking molding.

[Here's Harbour](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/592d49b4d1758e7c6fe64d08/t/5952ac68db29d663f9c532ae/1498590334147/) around the time of costume fitting&&I still can't see any of Harbour in it, it just looks like Perlman to me. That being said, it looks fucking great.&&[deleted]&&This better not awaken something in me. &&This one seems much more detailed, especially when you compare it to [this](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/t/5911df0f440243be5603aa42/1494343446246/?format=750w) picture.&&But wont have the same voice.&&To be fair, they are both based on the same character who (as far as I know) has never been drawn in the comics by anyone other than Mike Mignola. There's not a lot of variety in his look. It's not like Spider-Man who has been drawn by tons of artists and has had several different looks. &&And that's really fine by me.&&Yeah it seems to just have more detail and also it's not like you can go that crazy with hellboy. Would have been cool with yellow bigger eyes tho &&Thanks for not lying!&&It would all be in the lighting, and I don't mean by having a lack of lighting and too much black, but by actually playing with the shadows to create scenes abd composition, and contrasting it with more color from the lighter that is there. &&I think the lighting here, at least, is a pretty solid real-world effort to capture Mignola's style.

A Sin City-type feel seems like it'd work.&&[I'll just leave this here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbsDvGtTRWU)

It's the pilot for an animated series that never got picked up, based on Mignola's comic The Amazing Screw-Off Head. Mignola's art style works surprisingly well in motion.

I have seen this pilot like five times already, it has Paul Giamatti, David Hyde Pierce, Patton Oswalt, Molly Shannon, and some really good writing.&&That's a very important distinction as well. Perlman embodied and sold Red's irreverence so well that folks only casually familiar with the comics (like myself at the time) were instantly sold. Even after getting into the series I still loved him on the big screen, but it becomes very clear that he only sells one faucet of HB, albeit really, really well.

This take on him looks to be a bit more rounded, a bit grittier if you will.

Initially I wasn't super happy that Ron wasn't coming back in the role, but the more I see, the more I feel that this movie will contrast and accompany very well both Ron's version of HB, and the comic version. &&What do you mean ""YOU PEOPLE?""&&Damn! I was just gonna comment and ask if they were completely rebooting. That's really unfortunate. I've never read any of the Hellboy comics but I enjoyed the world they built in the 2 movies we've got, especially Del Toro's!

Edit: Didn't know how to English &&See, I'm strongly against making Perlman's Hellboy into a trilogy. And not because I didn't like the first two, I loved them to death. It's because of Liz saying that she's carrying Hellboy's twins at the end of the second. Keep moving that story forward and it would just turn into Shrek.&&[deleted]&&This. Pearlman had the genuine embodiment of what Hellboy should sound like. 

I don't doubt Harmour will do a good job.&&Anybody know of a good example of him doing a Hellboy-ish voice?

Can he pull it off?&&Weird how he changed his name to David Harbour, though.&&I wish this was an official Hellboy 3 instead of a reboot. I haven't even seen the first one, but I know about how passionate everyone involved was to get a 3rd one made.&&[deleted]&&Holy fuck, I forgot Hopper was playing Hellboy and didn't even recognize him.&&I know ""darker and grittier"" is a bit of a cliche in hollywood right now, but i do really want a darker and grittier Hellboy movie.  
  
The del toro movies were great, but i really wish they didn't have the romance subplots.&&Yeah, this is just the first picture though, he might have it tied back in the film itself.&&Usually in a bun. Probably just down for dramatic effect.&&Comic book Hellboy is bald. Ron Pearl Hellboy has a type of [top knot](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f904b3eced26cfbe72e918d70a441e91.webp) except the folded bit of hair is further back.

Also Pearlman's Hellboy is nothing like comic Hellboy at all. Comic Hellboy is much more srs bsns.&&Probably put the hair down because he really looks like Ron Pearlman's, and he never put the hair down so...&&>Because Hellboy ~~looks likelike~~ is Ron Perlman.

FTFY&&Give me back my shield, you snake bastard.&&If they decided to do a female Hellboy (Hellgirl), and cast someone unmistakably feminine - like the tiny Emilia Clarke, for example - she would probably still end up looking like a jacked Ron Perlman after all the makeup is applied.&&Honestly, that was some damn good casting (Perlman in the 2004 movie).

Honestly though, Perlman nailed the big guy so well first time through and their prosthetics people were amazing. &&Crime, penetration, crime, then back to the lab for full penetration, crime, penetration, and this goes back and forth for 90 or so minutes, until the movie just sort of ends.&&I heard he hangs dong.&&Best movie I've ever seen in my life.

&&This reminds me of how I recalled Ang Lee's Hulk to be pretty good, except for the stupid plotline.

1. The range of roles he had by then told me he was an actor who will respect a role no matter what.

Yes. Would watch that twice.&&Villain for season 2 looks awful Ogdru-Jahad-like...&&> The whole thing is just kinda... off. Theres some kind of that vibe from the hellboy comics that's missing.

Del Toro's Hellboy movies captured the spirit of the comics pretty well. Outside very on-the-nose attempts to make those movies seem like your average superhero movie with typical one-liners and gags, the tone reflects the world that Mignola have created. The first film was creepy, nasty, and Gothic. The second film felt more like a folk tale, was more vibrant, and bigger. If we talk about comic book movies that miss the vibe from their respective source material, there isn't better example than Iron Man movies. Especially the sequels. They felt more like sitcoms than comic book movies.&&Agreed.

I think it's that they made a kid's film. But it was unsuitable for kids. Everybody but Ron and David Hyde Pearce acted like they were in a pantomime.

As soon as I saw the tattoos I knew it was going to suck balls because it was obvious they were trying to force the image too hard. Ledger's Joker felt natural and evolved with his personality suited for the look whereas Leto's looked like what a high school kid thought was gangster and edgy which bled over into how the character behaved and felt.&&That poster with the ""Damaged"" tattoo on his forehead really should have been a wake-up call for everyone. The fans *hated* it, and the studio didn't really see the problem with it.&&[deleted]&&[I remember defending Heath Ledger just based on his role in Lords of Dogtown.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faHe9M69LOI)  I don't know why, but just seemed like it would work&&I mean, the first one applies to Leto. The man has an Oscar. But no amount of acting can outdo a bad script and bad costume design. 

The warning for Suicide Squad is that it was a 1st draft cranked out in 6 weeks with next to no revision by a guy who thought putting a tattoo on the joker's forehead is a good idea. &&I remember saying Ledger would make a terrible Joker and couldn't hold a candle to Nicholson. Sure showed me.&&I think the editors were doing us a solid with that one.&&Joker: ""Do you wanna know how I got these tattoos?""

Me: From a tattoo parlor?&&Mark Hamill, hands down.  He will always be the Jokerest Joker bar none.&&I'm a bit of a Comic/Batman geek so admittedly I'm a bit biased but, I don't think either of them make solid ""clowns."" I'm actually not a big fan of Nolan's Batman whatsoever. 

However, Heath Ledger is a great actor, he plays The Joker as a terrorist, a pure sociopath who is unhinged and he does it fantastically. Theres little ""Clown"" to his Joker, and that's perfectly okay. He portrayed the adult side, the severely scary, possibly more ""realistic"" side of The Joker. Less puns and giant false teeth. Which is the entire feel I get from Nolan's Batman world. Adult, less cartoony, more serious. 

Jared Leto, to me, just felt like he was playing at a mockery in a movie-advertisement for Hot Topic swag.   &&> When Jared Leto's Joker asks ""Do you wanna know how I got these tattoos?"". I laugh because the truth of the scenario has got to be hilarious.

Wait, does the Jared Leto's Joker actually say that?

Well damn ring me up for a ticket aboard the hype train too!&&People in London confused it's not about Canary Wharf.&&You wonder why Wes Anderson films take so long to come out.. then you see a trailer like this and it makes perfect sense.

The attention to detail in his stop motion is unreal, man.  This should be brilliant.&&Honestly this is already the best movie I've ever seen.&&Wes Anderson, stop motion, AND dogs?

That's not fair, you can't just TAKE money from me like this. &&So very, very Wes Anderson. I wonder what his films will be like in his 60's? &&I really believe Wes Anderson is one of the best filmmakers currently working; I know lots of people aren't too keen on his idiosyncratic stylization but his films have such an intangible quality that I've never felt in anyone else's. 

They elicit certain feelings from me that I can't even explain; it's like some strange combination of both melancholy and warmth, both sadness and comfort. They make me reflect briefly on things in life that I've lost -- whether that be people, friendships, passion for something, my carefree youth, etc. -- but then comes back around to remind me that heartache and loss is a part of life, and reassures me that everything is going to be okay in the end.  

I get inexplicably emotional during the strangest parts of his movies, and yet moments later I find myself laughing and realizing that even with all the ups and downs and highs and lows, life is just a big, beautiful gift and we should enjoy every minute of it.

Needless to say I am so fucking pumped for this movie.

***

**EDIT:** Thank you for the gold kind stranger :) 

And for those wondering, here are the ""weird emotional"" (for better or for worse) moments I get from each of his films:

* **Bottle Rocket:** *""Her name is Inez!"" ""And my name's Dignan, man, so what? She never loved you, man.""* Also the ending, *""Just give me this one... They'll never catch me, because I'm fucking innocent.""*

* **Rushmore:** Too many to count, honestly, but some of my favorites: *""She's my Rushmore, Max.""* // The first time Mr. Blume meets Max's dad (*""It's good to meet you, Mr. Fischer.""*) // And the ending tears me up every single time, when ""Ohh La La"" starts playing and Rosemary takes off Max's glasses and just looks at Max then kind of sighs and smiles.

* **The Royal Tenenbaums:** Richie's suicide attempt, of course, but the part that gets me THE MOST is the very end, when Royal gives the Dalmatian to Chas and they're both kind of petting him and Chas says, *""It's been a rough year, dad.""* Holy shit, absolutely kills me.

* **The Life Aquatic:** Again, Ned's death is an obvious one, but I don't think I've ever NOT gotten misty-eyed when Steve and the crew see the Jaguar shark for the first time (that music, uuuuugh, perfect) and Eleanor leans to Steve and says, *""It IS beautiful, Steve,""* and he says, ""*Yeah, it's pretty good... I wonder if it remembers me.""* Oh my god the feels.

* **The Darjeeling Limited:** *""I've still got a lot of healing to do,""* and the entire flashback sequence to the day of their father's funeral and how hectic everything was and it juxtaposes with the funeral of the small boy and how quiet and calm everything was. That entire segment is just.. wow.

* **Fantastic Mr. Fox:** Lots of little moments here that always get me, some sad, others hopefully. *""I love you, but I never should have married you.""* // *""Ash...I'm so glad he was you.""* // and my favorite: *""We're all a little... 'different.' But there's something kind of fantastic about that, isn't there?""*

* **Moonrise Kingdom:** Not as many specific ""moments"" in this one, per se, but the entire thing is very touching and very nostalgic of that feeling of young love and just wanting to BE with someone (and not understanding why sometimes you can't be). Although I do always get touched when Sam's talking to Captain Sharp... *""Did you love someone ever?"" ""Yes, I did."" ""What happened?"" ""...She didn't love me back.""* So matter-of-fact-ly. 

* **The Grand Budapest Hotel:** Again, this one is more overall a story of joy, but man, when they talk about Agatha's death at the end and old-Zero talking to the young writer tells him *""No, the hotel I keep for Agatha. We were happy here.""*... I fucking lose it.&&[MFW I realized I have to wait another 6 months for this movie to come out.](https://i.imgur.com/LeTj9Kf.jpg)



Stop motion is the greatest. I really fell in love with the craft in 2009 when Henry Selick did Neil Gaiman's Coraline and Wes did Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. Both those movies are outstanding. I really wish more high caliber directors would take on the art form. In 2015, Charlie Kaufman released Anomalisa which was absolutely brilliant but unfortunately fell under the radar like an early Coen brothers movie.




&&Not only this movie looks fantastic, but the cast is pretty awesome as well! Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Fuckin Murray.

I've never cared much for Wes Anderson, but Fantastic Mr. Fox was wonderful. I could definitely go for another movie like that. &&[deleted]&&I was wondering this too. the dogs are all japanese so they must be speaking ""dog"", It looks like the majority of the movie the dogs will only have direct contact with the Japanese boy.&&I wonder why the Japanese setting? Maybe it will make more sense in the movie, but I'm still super excited on it. &&i think it's so there will be no direct verbal communication from dog to human. the humans speaking english will be off-island.&&I'm going to guess that the film will allow us to understand people depending on which perspective we're following at the time. 

Like for instance when we're with the dogs they will speak English, but everyone else will speak Japanese. The dogs can understand themselves, but not others, same with the audience. Then when we're following people, like afro girl, they will speak English, we can understand them, but we can't understand the dogs. &&It looks like the dogs speak English to other dogs, and the humans will speak English to other humans. But in order to capture that dogs and humans can't understand each other, when the film is showing things from the dogs' perspective, the dogs hear humans speaking Japanese. When the film is showing a human's perspective, the dogs will just be barking.&&The New York Times raves 'You had at me Wes Anderson"" &&I could get by on Wes Anderson and the Coen Brothers. &&They sure did.  &&https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalWesAnderson/&&This is the most /r/movies type comment. &&Something about that moment really reminded me of Kubo. &&Reminds me of Bill Murray's lines from The Life Aquatic about 11 1/2 being his favourite age. &&Yeah, when the trailer can bring me to near tears with a single line of dialogue, I know it's something I'll probably love.&&Reminds me of a Demetri Martin joke.

Just the first 20 minutes had me in wonder and awe. &&[deleted]&&I was in college when this was released and we were doing a project on animation, so Fantastic Mr Fox was used as a good example of stop motion and as part of the reasearch we watched and read a load of behind the scenes stuff. They seemed to be trying really hard to make it look as 'stop motion' as possible, to the point where they were really exaggerating the flaws and claiming it was all part of stop motion. They claimed things like fingerprints on the models, slightly jerky movements, wonky scenery etc. were all an unavoidable part of the art.

Then we watched an Aardman documentary on Wallace and Gromit and it proved it all wrong by showing perfectly smooth animation with no flaws or fingerprints.

I get the art style they were going for and it is certainly distinctive, but it must be frustrating for an animator or modelmaker to be asked to deliberately do their job badly.&&Great point, I can see why that decision was made. The dogs are speaking English for ""us"", the audience, so if the boy spoke English it would seem weird that they couldn't understand each other. 

I almost think then that the human characters all shouldn't speak English, but I'm sure it works.&&If I had to guess, knowing Anderson, he was taken with the fashion and architecture from this period.

EDIT: I didn't realize the film was set in the future. The film's overall aesthetic sill looks like a retro throwback to me.&&Could be because Tokyo has an island, [Yumenoshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumenoshima), which was built from landfill.  William Gibson wrote about it in Neuromancer, some passages talking about land made from ""gomi"" (Japanese for junk), and it wouldn't surprise me if Wes Anderson got the seed of the idea from there.&&[they have islands full of one animal IRL](https://thetruejapan.com/4-amazing-animal-islands-in-japan/)&&""A handmade tale of horror""&&Fangoria Magazine says ""Da Fuh?""&&It looks like they sent us some kind of communique!&&Nah. I need some more variety than those two otherwise their styles lose their charm. 


Fincher, Scott and Villeneuve for a base. 

Nolan, aranovsky and bong jun ho for meat visuals. 

Anderson and Coens and Wright for pacing and off kilter comedy.

Jon woo, spike lee, and guy Ritchie for cheese. &&Oh, good, I thought i was just unreasonably sensitive. That line made me cry.&&I love how his style becomes more pronounced with every new movie.

I think it might be Wes Anderson's funniest movie.&&And Moonrise Kingdom. &&One of those rare movies where I started getting depressed as I could tell it was reaching its end. I was so engrossed in it, I didn't want it to end. &&Now I know why i recognized Ed Norton and F Murray Abraham's voices.&&I have great memories of watching this movie in the theater with a good friend who moved away shortly after. It was fun to watch and I immediately associate it with spending some quality time with a close friend.&&Well, animation takes a *liiiiittle* longer than most live-action, and stop-motion is no exception.&&I think he did a voice in sausage party if that counts at all haha.

Edit: sausage party not fest. &&Someone says that every time&&The Royal Tenenbaums and Grand Budapest tie for this honor, it's hard to beat.&&Currently, Ocean's 13. That's usually a great springboard for trying to connect actors easily.&&He will never top his role as Hal though. &&The whole thing was the most Wes Anderson thing ever. I love how his style keeps on getting more tuned and pronounced. You know those great parodies of Wes Anderson that crank the dial up for comedic purposes? Well this is even more cranked up than those.&&Yup, that line was down right parodical.&&It's so strange that this is their first time working together. Gerwig seems like the perfect Wes Anderson actress.&&Didn't even catch that! &&oh my god it's so obvious&&Oh shit that was definitely intentional.&&I admire the fact Anderson now has gotten Norton for 3 movies now.

Dafaq?&&They're all doomed because of the dog flu... this is their last hurrah, they're going to die trying to reunite Spot with his human - a la Saving Private Ryan&&Inb4 this becomes the animated dog version of Rogue One.&&I was always a Cranston-doubter because I'm a huge Seinfeld fan and could only think of him as ""Tim WHAT-ley,"" but then I binge-watched Breaking Bad in like three days and he won me over. He was fantastic as LBJ, and is pretty much a delight in everything he's in, so I'm down with adding him to the Anderson regulars. &&Oh please make this true&&Absolutely. Though Wes's catalog has MANY examples of his, I think my favorite is during *Rushmore* when Herman Blume meets Max's father for the first time and realizes he's just a barber, rather than the neurosurgeon that Max told everyone he was. There's this incredible range of emotions that comes over Bill Murray's face in just a matter of seconds. It's like, he's initially confused, then shocked, then grows into this state of sympathy -- as though he completely understands WHY Max made up this lie about his father (as though it were shameful he were ""only"" a barber) because he struggles with the same insecurity-complex -- and finally a little twinge of joy and sincere happiness that he's *finally* meeting ""THE"" Mr. Fischer. 

Scene kills me every single time.&&
For me, nothing will ever beat the shot of Agatha on the carousel. Her love for Zero comes through so powerfully and warmly. It's just so beautiful and pure. &&Anderson is one of few directors nowadays that seems to enjoy longer takes, and some takes that appear to only be master shots with a few inserts. It's a nice change of pace from the cut-cut-cut editing and closeup shooting of Hollywood Cinema. Anderson and Yeoman (his DP) really have a great thing going in terms of cinematography and how it can be used to elicit emotions and set a tone.&&Not only the directing that can coax this sort of thing from an actor and capture it on film, but the ability to pull together an ensemble of actors who can portray all of that emotion so well&&Moonrise Kingdom captured the essence of childhood better than any film I've ever seen&&*Nostalgia - it's delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, ""nostalgia"" literally means ""the pain from an old wound."" It's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards... it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called the wheel, it's called the carousel. It let's us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.*
-Don Draper, Mad Men

I think you hit the nail right on the head.&&Yep, there's no doubt about that, either. Nostalgia is a feeling that sounds so intangible on the surface, yet Wes is able to evoke that level of sentimentality effortlessly. Only other director who's come close to nailing something like that (for me, anyway) is Noah Baumbach, which kind of makes sense since Noah and Wes have worked together on several projects before.&&Maybe this is why I don't care for his movies. They don't make me feel nostalgia at all. They feel like they're trying to make me feel something but it just isn't clicking, and the fact that I'm not feeling what the movie wants me to feel just leaves me feeling manipulated and frustrated. &&No. Owen would've made a fun dog, I think. &&No Schwartzman either.&&Wow...&&Wow&&I mean Bottle Rocket came out 2 years before Rushmore so it's not too surprising Schwartzman wasn't in that one, as Rushmore was his first acting credit.&&Goddamn it&&*you forgot your dog you idiots!*&&[deleted]&&Not to mention, the people who work with him tend to be actors who are known for being very selective about their roles, or who are notoriously hard to pin down. And Wes gets some of their best work out of them. 

For example: Bill Murray has been in every single one of his movies since Rushmore. Even his minor performances such as in Moonrise Kingdom are fantastic. 

I’m admittedly a bit sad we won’t see Willem Dafoe as a dog. But we get Jeff Goldblum as a dog. The world can always use more Wes/Goldblum. 

And Cranston? Likely an amazing addition. &&The Grand Budapest Hotel soundtrack was in my top 10 most played albums in 2016. That album is an adventure by itself.&&The tune is Sergei Prokofiev's ""Lieutenant Kijé."" Greg Lake features it in his song ""I Believe In Father Christmas"" as well.&&https://i.imgur.com/XUyXCM5.jpg&&If you get a chance to work with Wes Anderson I can’t imagine asking for a ton of movie. Every single one of his movies gives the actor a new challenging role that is so different than what they usually play.  For example Owen Wilson not type cast as a goofy love interest, Ben Stiller not being a comic foil, the list just goes on and on.  Every single movie he makes showcases its actors while using very interesting settings to enhance them without being overly distracting.

I love how you just cited some random person in the future.You're completely right, there will be a detailed and insightful explanation in due course.&&On a semi-related note, the Canary Islands probably got their name out of a belief that they were inhabited by large numbers of dogs.

>The name Islas Canarias is likely derived from the Latin name Canariae Insulae, meaning ""Islands of the Dogs"", a name applied originally only to Gran Canaria. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the Mauretanian king Juba II named the island Canaria because it contained ""vast multitudes of dogs of very large size"".[21]

Like, ""it could've been a picture book"" levels of basic.&&Very different, but still such an incredible gem of a film. I would have been more bothered if the film ended up feeling like a sad approximation of the Dahl original, but it was so chock full of quirk and humor that I found myself ultimately unconcerned as too the discrepancies. Still, there's nothing like that feeling, as a kid, of reading the original with all of its exciting underground subversion of those nasty farmers.&&I've been reading Dahl books with my son since he was about 4. We always watch the movies (if available) after we finish the book. We, too, were surprised.&&People hit on Wes Anderson for being a bit one note and I think superficially that's maybe a tiny bit true (although not really as much as people think) but GOOD GOD what a lovely note it is.   &&I remember watching The Darjeeling Limited before I knew about Wes Anderson and was bored to the tits.  I saw Fantastic Mr. Fox and loved it, bought it on DVD and still was another 5 years until I would go back and watch all of his films and come to love The Darjeeling Limited because it almost has a strange feeling to it that I can watch it over and over and over again like a few other movies:  Midnight in Paris (seen 8 or so times), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (10 times bc mostly kept seeing with friends who hadn't seen it, Spirited Away (5 times), and TDL.

Strange but I don't find any of those movies a 10/10, more likely 7 or 8/10 but I can always watch them and always feel good.&&It seems there are two points of view: one of from the main dog, and one from the human girl.

&&Exactly! Another poignant scene is in *Moonrise Kingdom*, when Bill Murray's and Bruce Willis' characters are driving at night, in a state of emergency about Murray's characters missing daughter, and Bruce asks Bill how his wife is taking it, calling her by her first name.

""How's so-and-so?""

Bill Murray doesn't answer his question, and I believe responds with one of his own-

""What's it matter to you?""

Bruce doesn't answer, he just falls quiet. A look of understanding and remorse falls on Bill Murray's face as it literally falls into shadow. That scene holds for a good few seconds.&&""I'm a little bit lonely these days"" *while smoking 2 cigarettes at the same time*

I've seen the film many, many times and I don't recall Spitz ever being tranquilized.
The beagles guarding Boggis's property are tranquilized during a heist. Bean's rabid dog Spitz chases Mr. Fox after Kylie fails to produce a blueberry when Mr. Fox demands one, despite the fact that Kylie has a reminder written on his palm.
Spitz is later used by Ash as a diversion. The heroes escape while the dog chases the villains.
Spitz doesn't appear in the film until Mr. Fox and company go to Bean Annex to rescue Kristofferson, and he doesn't appear again after chasing Bean and his henchmen.
He never consumes a blueberry because there are no blueberries for him to consume.

So seeing him working there made me momentarily have a little ""HA!"" moment, which luckily only lasted a moment and it didn't end my crush on him;  he was still adorable.

"During the filming of ""Borat"", the FBI started a file on Sacha Baron Cohen after receiving numerous complaints about a strange man traveling around the country in an ice cream truck",52740,6xwmoz,http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sacha-baron-cohen-fbi-was-compiling-a-file-during-borat-w165267,1178,1504481598.0,,"When this movie came out, I managed the video department of the store I worked at.

We had a life size cardboard cutout to hold some of the movies for sale. 

I took it home and put it on my back porch looking out a window. I used to have kids run through my backyard constantly, or on lunch break from school hide in my backyard to smoke cigarettes.

It stopped after having Borat look out a window holding a mini-American flag.&&About as unrelated as it gets but his cousin, Simon Baron-Cohen researches autism at Cambridge. I read a paper for my journal group recently and it just had the author listed as S. Baron-Cohen so for about 30 seconds I thought Borat was a published neuropsych researcher. &&I would love to see a short documentary on the making of Borat. With the FBI, his assault on Pamela Anderson. So much shit went down when they made this movie. &&Here's what Cohen said about it: 

>“[The FBI] got so many complaints there was a terrorist traveling in an ice cream van,” the actor said. “So the FBI got so many complaints that they started compiling a little file on us and eventually they came to visit us at the hotel. I obviously went missing when I heard because [the film crew] were like, ‘FBI’s downstairs. Sacha, disappear.""&&Very nice&&I have said this before, and I will say it again

Borat was, bar none, the funniest movie I have ever seen the first time I saw it. I have never seen a movie that had me laughing so hard for so long. Watched it again soon after release and wasn't as funny

Then last year I watched The Ali G show and saw all of Borat's hilarity, and rewatched the movie, and once again, , just like when it came out in 2006, had me on the floor laughing.

Borat needs to go into the Congressional Movie Archive or whatever they call it. This was the funniest movie ever made and Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius.&&Greaaattt Success!&&I need to watch Borat again&&I'm from Fort Smith, AR and lived there back when they were filming the movie (can't remember the title) where Sacha filmed a scene in which he was in a cage wrestling/fighting competition, gave a dude a blowjob, etc. (someone help me here..) 

My buddies (think Copenhagen chewing, bud light drinking homophobes) told me that the Kay Rodgers Expo center was hosting some cage fights with $1 pitchers. I was only 19 so I didn't go. Not a wrestling/fighting fan. Well, I'll be goddamned if they didn't have some wild ass stories to tell. The chairs that the crowd threw into the ring during the movie were hands down 100% real people who were pissed TF off. It was the best thing I've never experienced. 

Edit: here he talks about this scene with Jimmy Kimmel https://youtu.be/Fauqs_DFg0g&&I wonder what their file on [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/yavNcRN.jpg) looks like.&&No bullshit, but the scene where he goes to visit the black chick at the end, at her house, was filmed across the street from my mother in law. We saw him walking down the sidewalk doing takes and I even asked, but they were pretty hush. When I brought up Ali G, I guess the production assistant realized I was a fan and told me to keep it quiet. 


Street view 1331 west congress street, San Bernardino ca 92410 and look at the house on the south side of the street. &&""Now we go to Washington D.C. home of mighty US warlord, Premier Bush. IZZZ NICE!!""
&&This is some Beavis and Butthead Do America shit..&&Started a file means they opened up a folder to put all of those complaints. Started an investigation is where they actually did anything at all whatsoever about it. They're not morons.&&My oldest brother and I took his Ice Cream truck to Mexico in 1986 to watch the World Cup. In hindsight it was the most surreal Hunter S. Thompson-esque experience - it was on a complete whim, he literally paid a hooker's mom to give me a blowjob in an outside staircase when I was barely a teenager. We saw the hand of God live. Such an amazing memory - he died almost 20 years ago and I still hold every moment of that impromptu trip close to my heart.&&Wasnt this already on the main page a few weeks ago?? &&A friend of mine lost her job... related to the TV Weather segment of the movie. She's seen for a couple of seconds in the final cut so she's got that going for her.&&I love how it makes America seem small townish.

She is #4 prostitute in all of kasakhstan.&&Whatsup vanilla face?&&Next thing you'll tell me is that Steve Buccemi was a firefighter!&&In other news, Steve Buscemi worked as a firefighter on 9/11.&&Cracking down on that Kazakhstani spy ring.  They want to sabotage our potassium.&&Borat to the FBI:

""You will never get this, you will never get this. La la la la la la!""&&Lmao&&This has been posted here 7 trillion times.&&About 12 years ago (when Da Ali G show was out but ""Borat"" wasn't) my uncle was producing a dog show for Animal Planet. He sees Sacha as Borat (he loved the show) come in the door and very politely says ""Sir, I am a huge fan but you can't be here, I have to ask you to leave"" and Sacha nods and heads out but about 15 minutes later security catches him trying to come in the back door! I am glad for the sake of my uncle's job they thwarted him but god I am sure that would have been an incredible thing to witness.&&""And her virgihn hangs like sleeve of Wizard...""
 The guy's reaction to this line is fucking priceless. &&Only the 40th time this tidbit has been posted this month &&If you are going to repost something, at least try to change the title so people can pretend you just thought of this. What are you going to do with your imaginary internet points?&&Holy shit, what are you gonna tell me next?  That Steve Buschemi was a volunteer firefighter after 9/11?&&I've seen this on the front page every week for the last 3 years.

I likea very much the music of Korki Buchek&&When I tell american where I am from, I tell I was born in Kazakhstan. Barely contained smirking ensues. &&Is it that time of the week for this post already?&&Uncle Borat has been naughty. &&I have that same cutout!! It still stands behind a door in a spare room. My mother was over here with a friend's kid the other day... He's probably about ten or so. He came running out of that room all nervous looking, so I said, ""Dude! What's up?"" And he says, like the child that he is all spooked, ""That guy behind the door is creepy!!"" I tried really hard not to laugh, but I couldn't help it... So I told him a little about the character and talked like Borat so he understood. I didn't want to take the time to find a clip safe enough for a kid. Anyway, maybe you had to be there but it pretty hilarious!! &&Very nice&&Damn. I don't even know what the cutout looks like but I can see all of this happening so vividly. This honestly made me laugh so hard. Thank you. &&I still remember going to Blockbuster as a kid and seeing the same cutout! :0 &&Anicee&&Our band took a picture with that Borat cutout! He was part of the crew and very niiice&&Wawaweewa very nice! I like!&&I always thought video stores got the cutout by stealing it from the cinemas. &&Sacha Baron-Cohen himself went to Cambridge&&Found that out from a documentary I watched a few years ago:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xp0tg8

around 21 minutes in&&Oh wow, I always thought ""Baron"" was his middle name, not a hyphenated part of his last name.&&[deleted]&&It can get even more unrelated. This morning I didn't even eat breakfast. &&They actually both went to that school.&&My wife has a masters in that field and met him a few times at a number of conferences. Says he looks just like his brother&&OH GOD YOU TOO?&&[deleted]&&It's such a shame that he'll never be able to pull off a movie with a character to that degree ever again.  Borat + his recognizable face = a high probability that at least *someone* in the room is going to recognize him and ruin all the time and effort he put into making it believable.  

I facing loved that movie... nearly pissed myself the first time I saw it.  I had literal tears POURING down my face and couldn't catch my breath I was laughing so hard I almost died.  Very nice!&&Almost getting killed in Salem, VA. The scene where he sings the national anthem. It didn't go over very well.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywzQectJ_P0

This is a fascinating documentary about the making of Borat, but more so about the consequences for the people living in the Romanian village of Glod who unwittingly playing the backward idiots of his fictional homeland. 


&&Parts of the movie was scripted, unlike the 2003/2004 HBO show.

However, there are many, many hours of unused footage from filming - including a civil war reenactment and Borat being arrested at the border. I just hope that they release a bunch of deleted scenes with some sorta future box set or whatever.&&Terrorist traveling in an ice cream van **WITH A BEAR**&&Why did Sacha feel the need to run?&&Is this a Les Miserables reference? ""It's the police disappear, run for it, it's Javert!"" (Cohen plays one of the characters who intend to run upon first sight of the police)&&What's amazing is that everybody's going to take his word for it.&&How much?&&I could not understand what this little man was telling me&&Why would I make joke about sexy time with my motherinlaww?&&I concur. Nothing has shit on this movie in terms of making me laugh. I often find movies funny, but they seldom make me LOL. This is the single funniest movie ever made. 

""Is that a...cat in a hat?""

And now I'm laughing like an idiot on the bus. &&Totally agree. I think it has to do with it not really being scripted for me and people involved thinking ""What the fuck"" just gets me going. I have so much respect for SBC. &&Not just because it was funny as hell but also because it so uniquely portrayed/parodied America of that era through unassuming non actors. It definitely belongs in an archive.&&The Borat scenes from the Ali G show are still some of the best. I nearly died from laughter at the wine tasting one... &&The fucking grocery store cheese scene kills me. I think it was a deleted scene but it's still one of my favorite things ever...the man that put up with him is a god damn saint.&&If you want a laugh, try the TV Show ""Nathan For You."" It's my absolute favourite. It's about a guy (with really good grades) who tries to help failing LA businesses with shitty business ideas.&&*ten minute moment of silence*&&Yes! I'm glad others agree. I've felt the same way since i first saw Borat, but haven't really put words to it. I think you're right, no movie has made me laugh harder. I can't imagine the kind of person who can watch it without laughing.&&
>This was the funniest movie ever made and Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius.

IIRC he is literally borderline genius, or at least has a very high IQ.&&Is this the one where he starts wrecking some old people's antique store? Cus that was fucked up.&&Ah Verry Naaaice.  I second that. I still roll when I watch the YouTube clips.  &&Yeah, the scene in which he and his manager wrestled had the entire theater laughing for a solid minute. I don't know if I had been watching it at home alone or with just a couple of other people if I would have laughed nearly as much -- this is why Netflix will never completely replace movie theaters -- for comedies in particular, it magnifies the experience.&&I was lucky to come into it cold, as was given free tickets to an early screening by a friend who worked for a film distributor. I was laughing no stop, to the point of pain, where I didn't want to laugh anymore. I just had no idea what to expect. All I knew what that it was SBC, and I knew nothing else, no trailer, no premise.

The second time I watched it, I was surprised how little I enjoyed it. I still think it's a great movie - I just don't know if it has that repeat watchability for me. 

If I had one of those Men In Black memory erasers, going back to watch Borat for the first time would be one of the first things I'd do.&&I saw this movie stoned as fuck several times in theaters &&I could swear that I just saw it on Netflix recently but I just checked to confirm before commenting that but it's not there!

I'm a police dispatcher, thus plenty of people call me about suspicious activity daily.  Weird person in an ice cream truck would never make its way up to the FBI.  I guess it possible that people call the FBI directly, but I doubt it.  Most everyone just calls 911 or their local police number.

So as the actor who the entire movie revolves around, getting in legal trouble would bring an immediate halt to all production of the film. It's always best to be on your best behavior when not in your native country, it's very easy for any government entity to send a foreign citizen back home with a limited ban from the country. If he were an American, he wouldn't have any real reason to feel the need to run.&&This whole story is made up lol. He told it on a talk show.  It's been proven he makes up a lot of stories about the movies. He told this elaborate story while filming Bruno about meeting the terrorist. But the ""terrorist"" saw the movie and realized what he was being portrayed as and came out and said he's a father and has a normal job and that Sacha and his crew showed him really graphic porn to get those reactions from him.     &&exactly &&After hearing so much shit about US police and agencies, I wouldn't blame him&&Quote is in an interview with Marc Mason. Basically, if he got arrested it could fuck up his visa and compromise the movie being made. So first plan was whenever shit hit the fan with the cops get out of the state. 

Edit: he's British. &&Sheee is my seester &&I like you. You like me?&&No... its a tortoise in a shell&&It's was sort of like the Blair witch project. It was unique at the time and you didn't know what to expect. How much of it was real. Etc.

Funniest part was that this is in a bad neighborhood, like bad bad. So when they were doing a take, a neighbor pulled down the street blasting music, a production assistant signaled for him to turn it down and a verbal altercation started, pretty one sided, threats included.

As for your experiences, I couldn't imagine pursuing a PhD in chemistry no matter the institution.

Each field has its set of difficulties and applications. Thankfully you've acknowledged it. I'm just tired of people here thinking that the humanities lack rigor and value.&&Reddit gets a huge boner for critical thinking, right? A classical education is the basis for how one thinks critically about Western society. Learning to read the classical languages and then interpreting the foundational works of our society gives someone insight into history, psychology, and civics better than the vast majority of his or her peers. It's an excellent course of study for financiers, physicians, lawyers, and politicians, or anyone who needs to think more broadly about how the foundations of our culture permeate throughout our daily lives. In short, it gives intellectual flexibility. The pure sciences give the same degree of flexibility, but something like engineering doesn't.

Considering how society is a product of both it's people and their ability to improve their surroundings, couldn't it be argued that the 'thinking outside the box' mindset needed to interpret, design and construct what people desire, indication of a reasonably flexible intellect also?

What a movie, Mark!&&I'm seeing the premiere tonight at midnight at TIFF. will reply with first impressions when I get out. Can't wait. &&James Franco looks like a young Ed Harris with hair. &&In the first half second after opening the image my brain went ""is that Tommy Wiseau?"" so good casting (or makeup)!&&I'm not a huge fan of the Francos and Seth Rogen but like many, I will definitely buy myself a ticket when this opens in December!

&&This whole movie will basically just be the small section in Hot Rod where they try to make a badass movie and unintentionally make a comedy.&&The Book was fantastic, so I'm very excited to watch this film.&&The movie I didn't know I needed &&I hope this movie is better than Sausage Party. I didn't laugh once. Too many obvious dick jokes and nothing up to their usual standard of comedic value.&&These guys really just do whatever the f*ck they want &&Looks like another Franco behind Dave's head 

&&Call me crazy, but is that Seth Rogan and Zac Efron sat behind in the second row!?&&Doesn't matter where I am. Every time I see Seth's name all i hear is 


Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh&&I say we go to the premiere in tuxes and play some catch while we wait in the line but then stop suddenly and act like it never happened lmao&&Pretty sure that is Zac Efron next to Seth &&Saw trailer for it my 2nd time seeing It and I am stunned that this is even happening. As if The Room wasn't bad enough. Now they wanna make a movie about making the movie?

Who am I kidding. I'll probably watch it since I have a MoviePass now.&&Love how you can scarcely tell that Seth Rogen and Zac Efron are in the background.

Also Alison Brie's name is in the credits brb buying a ticket now.&&oh hi mark&&YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA&&Guys don't plan too much, it may not come out right.&&How is this a new poster? I saw this when that teaser trailer came out.&&All of a sudden there are lot of A24 things out there. &&Like when your little sibling watches you play video games &&This is my most anticipated movie. I've seen the Room at least 20 times and thought the Disaster Artist was the funniest book I've ever read. I'm super hyped for this movie especially since it's gotten stellar reviews so far. Otherwise I'd be worried (Franco's impression seems good, but he's way too tall and skinny -- Wiseau is pretty short and stocky). Casting wise; Seth Rogen is PERFECT for his role. So is Sharon Stone. Dave Franco is where I begin seriously questioning things. And it's not just his height (Greg Sestero is literally a tall model who towers over Wiseau) and Dave Franco is short. Plus, everything I've seen from his mannerisms directly contradict Greg Sestero's attitude. Take this poster for example: He never *warmly* smiled (he and his family guffawed at an advanced screening they received) at this train wreck (unless it was with the expectation it would never see the light of day). Sestero was well aware of the train wreck that was being created far before filming ever started. He was probably the first to read the non-sensical script and let Wiseau know how crazy it was. Wiseau brushed it off. Sure, Sestero was slightly passive in much of his criticism, but it was definitely there.

For example, right before the film played at the premiere, one of the actors (coincidentally the guy who originally had Sestero's role was there) turned around in his seat, and reminded Sestero that this movie would permanently be listed on his imdb page.

It's important to note that in no way the look on Franco's face in this shot is meant as disappointment. it should ONLY be interpreted as ""I have created a legitimate work of art masterpiece."" 

Most importantly, Sestero was Wiseau's roommate* (this is a funny, somewhat horrifying story) and friend* (also somewhat complicated), but definitely wasn't like this saccharine type that appears to be exhibited in Dave Franco's ""kid glove"" treatment in the clips and the look on his face in this shot. If anything, he viewed Wiseau with skepticism and severe reservations. At the point this film premiered, Sestero was happy enough for Wiseau, but certainly wouldn't have been smiling like this. If anything, Sestero was one of the few people that managed to ""handle"" Wiseau without being fired or quitting (basically because Wiseau bribed and lied to keep him along).

I'm nitpicking, but I freaking loved this book. &&That thought is just too cute to handle. &&>I did not&&LINE!&&Oh hai mark
&&(6 hours, 37 takes later, the take we got https://youtu.be/M5PuJGzbcvY (:14) ) Yeah that's the best one  &&Almost looks a bit like Travolta in Pulp Fiction&&I thought it was Jared Leto at first.&&Michael Scott in a wig, but not Steve Carell. &&Almost looks like Nicholas Cage&&I'm seeing Dennis from IASIP but with long hair.&&As someone with a big crush on James Franco, I predict that this movie is really going to confuse me&&[deleted]&&Pretty sure its because he's got his eyes more than 1mm open, im not used to seeing him not squinting constantly.&&Tbh Dave looks more like James than James does&&Featuring James Franco as Mark Strong, but with hair.&&Looks kind of Glenn Howertonesque to me.

Edit: well I didnt read far enough down and see someone already said this. Soooo..... fuck. &&Do you think we have to see the Room to enjoy this movie?&&[deleted]&&Yeah, I had to explain The Room to my dad and brother and realized how hard it is to explain The Room, period.&&Okay, I thought I was going crazy. I saw It Thursday night at the Alamo Drafthouse and they showed a new trailer that I couldn't find online for the life of me. It was a great trailer, really showed what they are going for in the movie. I really want to see it again so I can pick it apart.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&pls A24, give us the trailer.&&A friend of mine suggested to watch the room but didn't let me in on the joke. He just said it's a really good movie and that my wife and I would enjoy it. 

At first we thought he suggested to us a soft core porn. But then we realized he had given us a gift that was pure bliss. 

I still can't describe the pure absurdity of watching it the first time with no knoweldge that I was witnessing a pure train wreck. 

The Room is a masterpiece only because of how ungodly bizarre it is. So many movies after it have tried to be tongue in cheek/ wink and nod bad. But nothing will ever be as terrifically horrible as The Room. 

To this day I still believe that Tommy is an alien and The Room was his report back to his home world on his study of humans and love. He is an alien wearing a human costume and he only barely understands us humans and then bonds that not only keep us together but that keeps us apart.  &&I saw the trailer as well, and having seen The Room, I got it. But I couldn't help but think about what a fucking mess the trailer was and if I was a person who hadn't seen the Room, what little sense it made. 


Not exactly a good advertisement.&&Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!&&Tell her it's about vampires. It ain't a lie&&In a few minutes, bitch.&&Usually trailer releases follow poster releases, so I'd bet we'll see it within 24 hours.&&Aw man I didn't get a Disaster Artist trailer before my showing. Just Death Wish and some shitty looking Christmas Bad Moms movie come to mind.&&He's really done well since Highschool Musical. cool dude.&&He's pretty funny. People didn't like dirty grandpa but I thought it was funny to see him as a ""responsible"" role. But the movie wasn't original. Hate better acting talent than writing talent. &&Don't forget Seth Rogen, Hannibal Buress, and Josh Hutchison playing the retarded character Danny. &&I thought it was Dave Franco a second time but yeah that makes more sense &&It definitely looks like him but it's weird that his name isn't on the poster. &&Looks like Zac Efron to me&&Best bit of James Franco's comedy central roast.

""Imagine if you really could polish a turd.""&&I tried to watch it, I really did. I felt embarrassed watching it. After the 2 pointless sex scenes and the flower shop scene of horrible dialog I think I decided to turn it off and watch reruns of the Cosby show. &&I reckon you have to have seen the original before watching this movie. Apparently no one else in the theater had seen it.&&[Downright microscopic](https://i.imgur.com/3aI3oeh.png)!  It would be less than 1mm^2&&I guess this flies over the head of our US letter friends?!&&you're tearing me apaaaart /u/Lars167&&Tommy Wiseau comes across as pretty serious in interviews, though. His responses to questions about the film's ridiculousness indicate that he doesn't get that the film is hilariously bad. I think that's it, maybe. It's like the rest of the world is in on this joke and he just doesn't get it. My take, anyway &&[deleted]&&Everyone is enjoying it because they think it's hilarious and tommy is either upset everyone isn't taking it seriously or is caught up in taking it seriously himself&&Getting really good reviews & audience feedback at the festivals it's been at.

Pretty much a lock to be great at this point.&&It's the font from the original poster for The Room.&&Fellow designer here. Old school. Last time I saw this face I was transferring it to the mechanical with a burnishing tool.&&The prominent registered trademark symbol like the original really sells it, too.&&Clearly you haven't seen his stirring performance in The Final, where he finds out he and his team have been betrayed just at the crucial moment, by a shadowy cabal of traitors and schemers in line with their global conspiracy for power.&&The fact that they chose December has people speculating that it might actually have a chance at an Oscar &&Definitely feels inspired by it. I think that's a pretty perfect homage.&&https://i.imgur.com/YvHSwJK.jpg

I just got back home driving 2 hrs from Toronto after seeing this at TIFF tonight. It was the premiere, nearly the entire cast was there plus Wiseau and Sistero. 

The film is incredible. It is a faithful adaptation of the book that Greg wrote, and it is just as absurd and incredible as you'd hoped it would be. 


This movie does NOT make fun of Tommy or The Room. It is incredibly heartfelt, wonderfully constructed, and hilarious in all the right ways all the way through it. 

The scenes they did recreate are nearly perfect (there was about 10 minutes at the end of the movie where they showed scenes they reshot side by side with the actual movie, and holy shit Franco got every. Last. Detail.), and the performances are respectful and faithful to their source material / actors. 

I was slightly worried that Franco couldn't pull the likeness off, but after five minutes or so it was spot on. There were scenes where he looked and sounded exactly like Wiseau, it was great. 

The crowd loved it, there was a Q&A after with tommy hosting, and in line before the film let in they gave out some awesome branded mini foot balls and plastic spoons. 

https://i.imgur.com/5p7ofYy.jpg



This movie lives up to every bit of hype that I had for it and then some. It's also really fucking good, too. 

The absurdity that went into creating the room is wonderfully captured, I can't even begin to tell you how well all the secondary parts were played. 

Go see this. It may actually have a shot at some major awards this year, it's great.


Oh. And there IS a post credits scene that is not to be missed. &&Aww dude ;)&&My little brother is the only one I'll co-op with.&&My older sister and I are in our 20's and this is still an activity I treasure with her!&&That's me!

I think The Disaster Artist book would still be enjoyable to someone who didn't see The Room. The movie adaptation, however, will probably make more sense if you've seen the original movie since I assume there's probably going to be a lot of scenes of them doing their terrible acting and it's going to seem like they're exaggerating how bad it was if you don't have the context of having seen how exaggeratingly bad the acting *actually* was.&&Probably. From what I've seen of this on YouTube it's going to be hard to believe that the things they're doing aren't exaggerated.&&I think you need to see The Room to enjoy life.&&Watch it with friends, watch the Rifftrax version, then buy the blu ray and watch it over and over.

Oh and then you can play the video game too. http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547307&&>Do you think we have to see the Room to enjoy this movie? 

Absolutely &&Definitely. Several times.&&Do you know about life stillalone.....DO YOU!?&&So my wife and I actually just watched it recently, mostly because I wanted to see *The Disaster Artist*.

I'm generally not a fan of watching bad movies *because* they are bad. But this... is something special.

Imagine that an 8th grader needs to do a project on relationships for their Health class. Then imagine that 8th grader decides to make a movie but somehow gets a $6M budget. 

That's pretty much what you get.&&It's like Tropic Thunder.&&A movie about the making of ""The Room"", a movie so bad it becomes more unintentionally hillarious the more you see it.&&""Picture a pretty OK drama premise for a 15 minute long student film, but then make it more than an hour and a half long by adding in a few dozen scenes that literally do nothing, and also all of the actors are aliens who have been on earth for about two weeks and aren't great at pretending to be humans yet, and the alien who is the worst at pretending to be human wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it it""&&Augh! There's a new Disaster Artist trailer and it's not online yet?!&&I really hope it plays when I see IT. I'm a huge fan of The Room.&&Alamo is the best!&&There's an 8-bit The Room video game floating around the internet somewhere, since you're down the rabbit hole already.

Edit: [found it](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547307)&&Without seeing the movie I think you can still understand that they were attempting to film a scene and this one weird European sounding guy just could not learn his line. &&I also saw this trailer at IT and I think I'd already seen the footage online a while ago.  It's the scene where Franco keeps coming out of the stairway and forgetting his line over and over.&&But really though... the primary audience of The Disaster Artist is going to be people who've seen The Room.

A first year film student could've done better than this movie.  From what I've read, Wiseau was completely unaware of how bad it was until the movie actually was released and panned the way it was.  Apparently it was only years later that he started acknowledging the mistakes, and making excuses for them.  &&I'm not sure you would really need to.  In order to enjoy the Room you have to go in knowing you're about to watch a movie that intends to be serious but is so god awful its hilarious.  Disaster Artist is intended as a comedy, so it would probably be easier for people to get into it, knowing what to expect, most people just won't know that its meant to be a comical take on actual movie.&&I met Tommy Wiseau (and Greg Sestero) once at a restaurant in Santa Barbara where they were eating together. I had to interrupt them to say I was a huge fan. Tommy in person is EXACTLY who he is in The Room. He unexpectedly put me in this awkward headlock for the picture. Was awesome. &&Hmm good point. At first I thought he looked scared/concerned, but you're right maybe the idea is that he takes this very seriously and it's a joke to everyone else! &&Nah I think he gets it. The new movie ""Best F(r)iends"" is pretty obviously ridiculous too. He's a pretty fun guy.&&I want nothing more than it to win a Oscar, just to see Tommy W. on stage accepting his award. &&It brings me back to a time where my brother was my biggest fan.

I can't take the awkward.&&I just started it, I didn't think it would be this painful just 4 minutes in, my God. &&There is no point trying to enjoy this movie without seeing The Room first. It would be like saying you don't need to put syrup on pancakes - technically true, but incomplete without it.&&Not sure you need to watch the whole thing. There are condensed highlight compilations on YouTube that do enough to convey why it's such a hilarious debacle. &&I read the book first and then watched the movie.

Felt like nothing wrong to do it that way. The whole time I was reading it, I was thinking, can't wait to finish to see what the hell they were doing.

No idea if same effect would occur with the disaster artist movie. All I will say is that your life will be richer for taking in both the book and the room movie. Lots of shit to be baffled about and talk to friends with.&&Do you understand life?

DO YOU?&&[The blu-ray with the epic totally-unnoticeable Photoshop job on the eyes](http://i.imgur.com/2AZ0b.jpg)&&omg&&This is pretty apt. It's also kind of like watching one of those American Idol auditions where the people *think* they can sing but they. can. not.

Fuck, I love The Room.&&I love that game... so much!&&That was the first trailer, which is available online.

That's, like, cheating. &&Honestly the ""two characters go on a road-trip and hilarity ensues"" trope is why it wasn't looked on favorably. Compare it to something like, idk ""sideways"" and it falls flat. 

But I enjoyed the hell out of it.&&Same. I'm usually a little pretentious when it comes to comedy movies, but I weirdly loved Dirty Grandpa. Maybe it was the Plaza Effect. &&I'm with you on that... actually saw it on date night cause we weren't interested in seeing anything else playing at the time and we both enjoy a stupid comedy every now and then. We ended up laughing audibly for like 50% of the movie. Of course it wasn't very original and not much was going on with it, but it made me laugh like a motherfucker, and isn't that what comedies are about? &&I thought it was funny. The story arc has just been beat into the ground. I'd say it was pretty good. Glad I seen it. Idt I'd watch it again tho. &&The only actor that even *tried* in that movie.&&Aside from the absurdity of that scene, what was really glaring was how fake the set was.

As a whole I think his impersonation will be good enough to not be a problem.&&Yeah, there is a new trailer which was showing in the previews before ""It"".

I often felt the need never go above mediocre love for Seth Rogen because it seems people are 50/50 on him. In reality, he's one of my favorite actors and I even found myself imitating his very annoying laugh. I quickly stopped that habit. The interview is probably one of my favorite comedies of all time. &&I agree to an extent, but I also willingly paid to see a movie where a guy gets his arm stuck for a whole bunch of hours because I wanted to see James Franco. 

He's not a ""drop everything and go see this"" actor, but maybe a final push to see something you normally wouldn't...actor.  &&Until this movie, I'm not even sure you could accurately say his reception had been mixed.&&He's a method actor. He was prepping as Wiseau by directing all these other terrible movies.&&I heard a rumor that a lot of movies James Franco supposedly directs are actually directed by some fellow aspiring filmmakers he knows from a school or something and he was ghost directing trying to support them and get their films more exposure.&&[Yep.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiJ9fy1qSFI)&&Half the fun is in mocking it with your friends.&&It'd be awesome to go to a The Room / The Disaster Artist double screening. &&Still it'd be more enjoyable if you've watched 'The Room' and read 'The Disaster Artist'.&&Haha, what a story GucciGameBoy&&Me and a friend went to a screening he was at and he was signing posters as well. I had mine signed to my apartment number at the time which Wiseau translated to me being a numbered assassin and faked choking me during the picture with him. Was also awesome.&&Got that pic handy, boss?&&He did not hit you! It's not true! It's bullshit!&&He doesn't get it; According to Greg Sestero's book, Tommy took the film as a serious Drama movie even after seeing the final cut, he even submitted it for an Oscar. I'd highly recommend reading The Disaster Artist if you love 'The Room'.
Best F(r)iends is written by Greg Sestero, Tommy is only actor in it. &&As much as my brother annoys me 24/7... a few days ago I realised that I really am his biggest fan. 

We know that we annoy you, big brothers... but you're everything to us!&&Oh hai Mark!&&Oh hai mark&&Ha ha, what a story, Mark!&&Happy to hear I'm not alone in my mistake&&I remember a guy explaining the movie to me. He told me it's this guy that acts very weird with a messed up accent. And his girlfriend cheats on him with is best friend and this weird kid comes over and wants to watch them have sex. It was messed, so I watched the movie.

I was looking for something along the lines of Silent Hill The Room, his face during the explanation was confusion at how bad the acting was, not the discomfort with dark plot.

I think he was messing with me, because he kept saying how the main actor was dead inside, the cheating best friend had amnesia, and you never knew what was going to happen next.

&&I AM UNTETHERED AND MY RAGE KNOWS NO BOUNDS&&*you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose*&&My first time seeing the room was on Adult Swim, and that whole scene was ten minutes of moving black censor bars. When I watched it a second time, god help me, uncensored, I said a prayer of thanks to Williams Street for their wisdom.&&It's also anatomically impossible. 

From where their bodies are and the direction that he humps, he's going *in* on her navel. &&If you were making a movie and were also starring in it yourself wouldn't you start it with an overly long sex scene? He's living the dream.&&> should mention that the very first fucking scene is an overly long sex scene with waaay more Wiseau ass than you ever needed to see

Well, look, if you can't get through that one, you're not gonna survive the three others that happen in the next 40 minutes or so.&&and that the second scene comes 10 minutes later and uses the exact same footage&&I will also mention you get to see the same scene again later, because I'm guessing the actress refused to film another one.&&Me: Siri, find me polite company.

Siri: None exist in your contacts.&&Only because 13.6/10 is too much. The first ten stars are understood to be there, but they don't show up.&&> *""Drew Caffrey, who is credited as an executive producer and casting agent, died in 1999, three years before production began.""*

Wait what&&Yes, not to be confused with [Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/), the 2015 movie that's also incredible but in a different, more qualitative way.&&[deleted]&&Yes &&Yup, take a look at the trivia section to get a sense of how crazy this movie is. &&✊ YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! ✊&&Embrace the cringe :)&&Blasphemy you need to watch the whole thing.&&I think it's the kind of movie you really need to immerse yourself in. It's a whole different world for 90 minutes of your life. It's not something you watch; it's something you experience with your whole mind and body.  Be a Denny and watch it all. &&I'd watch the whole movie for completionist sake and to truly understand how bad it is but I understand this sentiment too. The movie's awfulness does not need a feature length presentation to showcase it necessarly.

I'm one of those people that enjoy Troll 2 much more. I think that's the superior ""bad"" movie experience. I feel like the room is all about how bad the acting and the dialogue is. Troll 2 has more going for it.&&The whole thing is awesome. Stop giving people misinformation.&&leave your stupid comments in your pocket&&That's Tommy showing you the correct way to watch his movie.&&Despite the movie being ridiculous, I really like the original cover to the Room.  Tommy looks so creepy, the Room would probably be like a good serial killer movie.  &&Pictures of Lisa, actually.

Also, his bathroom is a bucket.&&ur teering me aPART **LEESAH!**&&GED OUWD OV MAI LAIF&&In America we call that future wife huhuhuha 


Anyway, how is your sex life&&I've been waiting so long for a serious role to come around for Zack effron. I know this is a funny movie but I'm still waiting.  He always does such a great job in the shitty rom coms he acts in.  I'm hoping he will get a great role to put him on the map like Matthew McConaughey had in HBO true detective. &&A musical on Ted Bundy with Hugh Jackman would be great though. I'd watch the shit out of that.&&> And looks like he's going to be playing Ted Bundy in another movie. Not a comedic version.

Well I hope not.&&Now I want a Ted Bundy dark comedy&&I just watched it today totally sober, it was still pretty funny. &&It was funny and I was completely sober. I didn't know they were making it and went in with zero expectations, was pleasantly surprised.&&Lick my balls&&Sideways is great all the way around, but for me it's a movie I feel is for an older mature crowd.&&And man oh fucking day did he try&&An Oscar worthy performance for sure.&&What's hilarious is that, if you read the book, not only *could* they have filmed on an actual downtown San Francisco roof - they *did* film on an actual downtown San Francisco roof, *owned by Tommy*, to get the background footage that's chroma-keyed in on all the background scenes.

The most plausible explanation for why they made a rooftop set seems to be that Tommy was fixated on the idea of filming on a manufactured set as part of being a Big Hollywood Production, and that shooting on-location on a building he owned would have been ""Mickey Mouse stuff"".&&Anyway, how's your sex life?&&You see, Dave's entourage encircles and protects the delicate inner flesh of James' entourage.
&&Why don't you ever take me out anywhere, James? I sucked your dick, man! &&""127 hours.....

...is how long James's grandma has to live.""&&""Before the show, Seth and James rolled a giant fatty. That was the only way they could get Jonah on stage""&&he was so ruthless, he also got roasted hard too i loved all the fat jokes&&""What does my boy Bill do? He books himself a T-Mobile commercial.""&&All the while his hands shakier than a Parkinson's sufferer on a meth binge. Dude did so well considering how clearly (and strangely) nervous he was. &&Woah.  Thats a really good idea.

Even if not The Batman, could be a great case for JGL's Robin for his first movie...

Although if someone is going to ""be"" Ledgers joker, idk who could pull that off.  Hate to say it but maybe Depp is the closest stature-wise and enough of a chameleon that he could do it.  So long as he doesn't try to take it over and ""make it his own"".&&The eminem scene in the interview was so fucking funny. &&Speaking of 50/50 he was very very good in that film :)&&""people are 50/50 on him""

I see what you did.&&The best method actor since Jared Leto&&Oh definitely, I just have my doubts that the majority of people going in to see Disaster Artist will have actually seen The Room.  The majority will just be fans of Franco and Rogen.&&This was taken in 2009, seconds after the headlock...lol

They do monthly screenings of the Room in LA and SF that I think they often attend in person, so my guess is they were driving from LA to SF for one together and stopped in SB...

 [^[My ^Creator]](https://np.reddit.com/user/John_Yuki/) [^[Info]](https://redd.it/6yo2it) ^I ^am ^new ^and ^prone ^to ^making ^mistakes. ^If ^I ^make ^one, ^please ^alert ^my ^owner.&&I was talkign to my mom a few years back, and she mentioned she went to the movies yesterday. I asked what she saw, and then we spent like 5 minutes talking to each other about 2 separate movies.&&They're curing lots of people every day. &&-After filming the first love scene, Tommy Wiseau decided to write in a second love scene, but the actress playing Lisa was uncomfortable. As a compromise, the second love scene between Johnny and Lisa was created from unused shots from the first love scene (which is why the candles are already lit when they arrive).



-The reason why Peter seemed dazed and was touching things in one scene was because the actor had suffered a concussion and Tommy Wiseau wouldn't let him leave for treatment.&&My favorite nugget was that, according to Tommy, Denny has a mental disorder which explains his behavior. The actor, Phillip Haldiman, was not told about this.&&I'm fed up with this Wuurld!&&[The whole movie is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6D9Oifh9zU&list=LL75X1wC2owohl3Jy7D2yIhg&index=11)&&By watching only clips you lose some of the continuity failures like the cancer storyline that is mentioned and never revisited.  You assume things like ""well this is probably resolved or answered in another part"" or ""They act like we know who any of the characters at this party are, they were probably introduced"" but nah&&You watch The Room to see the most spectacular masturbation ever caught on film. The whole thing is based on a girlfriend that cheated on him and he movie is about how everyone betrays Johnny and can't see how he's pretty much the nicest guy on earth.

It's fascinating when you stop to think about the psychology behind it.&&If you haven't already, make sure to watch the documentary about Troll 2. It's called ""Best Worst Movie"".&&Troll 2 has the extra layer of the director being super fucking serious about its production and the resulting film. Tommy is at least *somewhat* self aware in retrospect of the film and even The Room isn't quite so crazy as Troll 2.&&Ur a lion, eye never heetchu!&&I DID NOT HIT HER I DID *NAHHT*&&ZE was in a great serious film called, the paperboy. Matthew McConaughey is in it too. &&Really enjoyed him in The Lucky One to be fair, thought he did really well with that role.&&I don't get why it gets all this hate. Maybe it's because I haven't seen the original, but parts of it had me rolling.&&There it is.&&*Throws football*&&""Actually Jonah almost couldn't make it tonight because he had trouble finding a tuxedo that changed in sizes every three hours.""&&I love ""stupid"" comedies, but I didn't really like The Interview that much. The Eminem scene had me rolling but that was about it. &&haha! That's great!&&Ours isn't so big. I'm 22, he's just turned 26... but he still treats me like a kid. Always looks out for me. Always trying to find projects for us to do together. 

It's nice! &&Man my little brothers are twins - 6 years old now. I'm 21. It's fun sometimes to pass them off as my own kids when cute girls wanna squish their cheeks!&&Anyway, how is your sex life&&I am not Tommy, I am NAAAT! Oh hi Mark.&&Nah, the lyrics are clearly:

*you are pot roast, you are pot roast, you are pot roaaaast*&&I like how you wrote the description of The Room like Tommy would have.&&Up until this comment, I thought everyone was talking about [Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/).  I was really wondering why people thought it was unintentionally hilarious.&&But did he hit her?&&That's the best description of the room I've ever read &&give him sugar... in water&&Dude **everything** about Wiseau is awkward.&&Lisa is actually Lisa #2. The original actress quit because of the sex scenes.&&Didn't he also put an extra sex scene in just so that he could get naked with her again?&&You chicken! Cheep cheep cheep!&&And I still don't know what it's about. &&Ohi money laundering, I didn't know it was you. &&Any stand out examples?&&I dont want to spoil my genius in some random reddit comment but I think ""the room"" is a play to launder money coming from selling and buying a forbidden substance and there are enough clues to figure it out somewhat rationally. Because the content of the movie was irrelevent it was perfect for a cult since its basically bad outsider art with no meaning. Every critic that ever talked about it is ridiculed and the famous ppl the guy is friends with know it. What is even mroe genius is that this movie could be a perfect hommage since it will make millions out of shit and the budget can be a bittload bigger without raising suspicion ;)&&I think he willed himself back in time after it was released and killed himself before he was really involved but because of time travel mechanics he's still credited. &&As the kid.&&Dont tautch me modderrrfuckerrrrrrrr....&&It's not quite the same as owning a copy on blu ray so you can see Tommy's butt in glorious hd resolution.&&What did I just watch. I am so confused by how bad this is. &&I've watched 30 minutes and seen 3 sex scenes. Is this movie constant sex scenes or what? And Tommy Wiseau how is creepy as crap&&It's the most intimate portrait of a person you could ever imagine seeing put on film, and he's completely oblivious to it.

I've got a pet theory that when they're talking to the psychologist, and Johnny tells the story of how he met Lisa, that it's actually the true story of how Tommy met the girl who cheated on him.&&> It's fascinating when you stop to think about the psychology behind it.

I'd argue that The Room is one of the most personal and deep movies of all time. The way people act towards Johnny in the movie, the things said, the things that happen, they all tell you so much about whats in Tommy's mind and how he feels about things. Wasn't that intentional? Not really. But regardless the movie really is a window into this insane man's soul.&&I don't know that you can say Tommy is self aware. While making the movie he was incredibly serious. And from the accounts of people that catch him moping around at screenings The Room is still his ""Tennessee Williams-esque"" masterpiece.

I guess you can say he's self aware in that Tommy understands that you and I see the movie as ""so-bad-it's-good"" and he's willing to pretend he made it that way on purpose so he can get the fame he so desperately craves. But that's likely not how Tommy actually views his masterpiece. 

Edit: meant to reply here but accidentally replied to the comment above.&&Oh HAI Mark&&That's funny because I bet he's going to follow the Matthew McConaughey career path, mostly non-serious comedic roles and then transition into all serious roles as he gets older&&Yeah I went in expecting it to be terrible but I liked it. It was pretty self aware and that made it work. &&Hello doggy!&&What a story, u/Duntchy!&&When I get around my little brothers, it's like we're children again. Today, I bought a red balloon and tied a clown dog toy to a string and positioned it in their room so it fell down when they opened their door.

I love being an older brother sometimes. &&I did NAAHT HIT HER! This is BULLSHIT! ...Oh, Hai, Mark, wanna play basketball while wearing tuxedos?&&You're my favorite customer!&&His comment was merely directed by Mr. Wiseau&&That's actual how Tommy financed the film IRL. Imported shitty leather jackets from Korea or something and sold them for a killing. 

The whole thing is just ""fucking what?""&&

More...

MORE!&&You mean how he believes the movie was a smashing success and people love it in an unironic way?&&So can we assume Lisa #1 was even more beautiful?  Is that possible?!&&I genuinely wonder how she feels. Like wow thank fuck I dodged that bullet or maybe shes like fuuuuuck myaaan that was my ticket&&There are *multiple* scenes.

My favorite is the one that's literally cut-and-pasted from an earlier scene. It~~'s literally the exact same scene.~~ might actually be parts of the first scene cobbled together with unused bits from it.&&Nah she refused to do a second scene so he just reused footage from the first one they filmed&&The sex scene stories were always a bit unsettling. I legit don't know whether to think Wiseau is a sexual deviant or just plain oblivious to how doing something so intimate would make someone feel uncomfortable. &&Oh hai doggie.&&I'm fed up with this world!&&Cheeeeeep cheep cheep cheep cheeeeeeiieeeep&&The cheep cheep cheep from The Room has been my Ringtone for about 3 years now. Sadly my phone is generally on silent or vibrate.&&It's a movie. You're supposed to watch it&&""The Rooom is a movie bout life"" - Tommy Wiseau&&Being torn apart by someone you didn't hit&&He got rich selling knock off designer jeans to tourists. &&Oh shit. Now it all makes sense.This was literally the plot to The Producers only in real life.&&Ohi Mark&&Tommy's background is mysterious, and he refuses to say what country he's from. He owns a lot of primo property in San Francisco inexplicably. 

During production, he bought all the camera equipment instead of renting, even though even the salesman advised against it. It was also shot on tape and digital cameras for no apparent reason. 

I read it a while back but that really stands out to me. There was another (living) ""executive producer"" who had no involvement as well. &&O hi Mom&&Like knotted rope&&Welcome to the experience that is *The Room*. All that's left now is to wait and see if you end up getting obsessed with how bad it is and watch it over and over while looking up all the information you can find about Tommy Wiseau, or if you just shrug and move on with your life with a vague memory of some awful movie starring a football-obsessed undead space alien with a vague European accent you saw that one time.&&Lol and they all take place in the same day. There's only 1 more after those three. But it's the longest one....&&That first 30 minutes was tough.  I feel like it must get easier from here. It has to. I gotta take a break.&&I watched it with my wife, my sister and her boyfriend. Everyone but my sister loved it because we kept talking about everything underneath the movie. The clinical sex scenes, the fact that there is literally not a single character that he doesn't go out of his way to be nice to but they all still stab him in the back, including Danny. Even his friends who don't actively participate in the backstabbing know that it's going on and simply mildly condemn it, but then continue talking to the person, the fact that his future mother in law keeps talking about how he's a good guy simply because of his bank account and the fact that the worst betrayal of all is completely premeditated. It says everything you need to know about Tommy Wiseau.&&Hi doggy! &&Oh hi Johnny, I didn't recognize you.&&hah! /r/bestof&&I'm pretty sure it was the slightly imperfect Levi's. Like the factory rejects&&good bot&&good bot&&""You idiot, you got us the movie about a mother and her son locked up in tiny room, the mother raped nightly for over a decade, while her son hides in the closet so as to not be inconvenience to his creepy ass dad. We can't laugh at this.""

""You idiot, you got us the movie about the retarded Pole and his adventures in a CG wonderland, with his close knit group of buddies who all want to sleep with his wife and are all on the spectrum. We can cry to this, but I'd rather not, not again."" &&he was being fair!&&I always feel bad that the description of Lisa's beauty is what makes me laugh the most. Zee most beeyyoouteeful girl in za world. 

It has to suck for the actress that people would cackle at that line. You aren't unattractive, Lisa! You are very pretty. But we can all agree that you're not THE MOST gorgeous person of all time, right? 

Ugh it feels so mean but it's just so bad, I have to laugh. &&Probably not. But on another, sort of unrelated note, I heard that if Tommy allows himself to sleep with you - then you achieve enlightenment.&&Has anyone from The Room had any sort of a career since?  I feel like it's ""Ruin your career"" bad versus ""Cult classic career launching vehicle"" bad.  Obviously the main dude wrote a book and now it's going to be a movie but idk that I've actually seen any of them on screen since.&&I'm not sure if anyone already said this (on mobile so most comments don't show) but the reason it feels copied and pasted is because they were! Wiseau wanted MORE sex scenes but she was so uncomfortable with the one they had done, she refused. He refused to budge on more sex scenes, said it was integral to the plot and his solution was just to reuse shots. 

If you ever get the chance, please read the disaster artist written by Mark's actor. It's a fascinating look into the mind of Tommy and of those in the cast. &&The actress was so uncomfortable with the first one, she refused to do the second one, so they just recut it and added the infamous flower shop scene to add context.

I'd refuse too if someone made passionate love to my belly button without my permission. &&Anyways, how is your sex life?&&You're my favorite customer!&&Everyone has betray me! &&*wurl&&*I'm fed ahp wit dis woruld!!

You gotta spell it right.&&Preferably in a crowded movie theater full of people who have all seen it at least 30 times.&&And underwear, don't forget the underwear. &&holy crap that's true. Bialistock & Bloom intensifies&&""Hows your sex life?"" Just took on a new level of creepy&&Ha ha you're so funny Voderman! How's your sex life?&&You're my favorite customer!&&You're my favorite customer.&&I peaked early &&I read the Reddit AMA that Juliette (Lisa actress) did about five years ago, and she said that that's one of the reasons why she doesn't go to *The Room* showings anymore - it bothers her because people always make fun of her appearance. She said she was shocked at how long the inelegant sex scenes were and how the fans kept pointing out the awkwardness and how the rose petals stuck to her back and looked like scabs. She heard someone say ""Lisa just looks like a bloated Britney Spears"" and never went to a *Room* showing again...poor Juliette, she seems to regret making that movie on some levels. She says in another [interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SLzQLQMTghs) that the film was something she jumped into when she was young and she would not do anything like it again. &&I'm duty bound to post this relevant Mitchell and Webb clip now:

https://youtu.be/Q2Eqk2Uppe4&&I think Mark Sostero's (spelling?) career is promising if he got a book adapted by the Franco Brothers. Tommy Wiseau is still being weird making shows about aliens torturing Tommy. And mom *definitely* has breast cancer. &&There's a new movie starring Tommy and Greg coming out soon. Can't remember the name, though.&&I would say that listening to the audiobook is even better since it's read by Greg Sestero himself and he does a great Tommy impression.&&The book is so good, I loved it.&&I definitely have breast cancer.&&You're tearing me apart!&&Lisa: I miss you.

Mark: I just saw you! What are you talking about?&&I can't talk about that; It's confidential &&Here you go keep the change!&&Oh I didn't recognize you! &&the fact that she didn't recognize him was the most hilarious part for me. I mean, come on look at him.&&What's bovering you Mark?&&It's not true I did not hit her, I did not!&&Don't forget the plastic spoons. Never forget the plastic spoons.&&He really is the American Dream.&&I mean, he's still selling the underwear.

Whoever did it gave me a laugh.&&""I 🎈 Derry""&&Just got back from seeing it and I say it deserves the success!&&I'm glad I was able to contribute to that 13.5 million last night&&I normally can't get into any sort of horror movie as they aren't my taste, but I'm actually pretty excited to see IT tonight.&&Damn! Now my wait for the DVD release is going to be so much harder... unless theatres will let me watch with the lights on &&I'm still pissed how bad they botched the Dark Tower. By all accounts this is much better.&&It's so damn good. A great horror but also fucking hilarious. The amount of tones it goes through is really amazing and it works great. Go see it&&My favourite scene was the projector, I won't spoil it, I'm sure everyone has seen the trailer, but that scene was probably my favourite, it was executed so well.&&Verry happy IT was awesome one of the best stephen king adaptation the money will float🎈&&Just watched it. I first saw the tv mini-series waaaay to young, and I read the book aged 14 in a holiday home where my room was awkwardly placed down a dark staircase beyond the laundry room. Needless to say this film brought back a lot of repressed fears, to the extent where I was squirming and swearing through every jump scare.

 I don't think my date was impressed but I genuinely enjoyed myself. Highly recommended.&&My very first thought was ""There is a George of the Jungle 2?!""  Then I realized I can't spell.&&Just out of the cinema. Very well done. Casting was on point. &&[I think he's pleased with his success...](https://tenor.com/view/it-movie-it-movie-gifs-pennywise-smile-grin-gif-9389071)&&Read this as ""It smashes opening night records"" Clicked to find out what movie op being so damn secretive about. &&Man, I would love to watch the movie in the cinema, but even if I'd go, it would just be a shitty dubbed version. Be glad you don't have to suffer through horrible German versions of everything, everytime you want to go to the cinema.&&Just saw IT tonight. Good flick. The girl next to me had her hands covering her eyes during every scene that got intense.&&A few years ago I took my nephew 13 year old nephew to a haunted house event at our local amusement park. One of the ""houses"" was an evil clown theme and this was when we found out he's deathly afraid of clowns. 

Fast forward to last month when he tells me he must see IT to face his fears. Ok sure. So tonight me and him (15 now) and his younger brother (14) go see IT. 

But before the movie I went and got 3 red balloons filled with helium and tied to a white string. Tossed those in my trunk and told my sister (their mother) to come by while we were in the movie and move the balloons from the trunk to the interior of the car. 

Fast forward to the end of the movie. They're both talking about how they weren't scared and it was more funny than scary...until they saw 3 red balloons inside our car. &&I see most projections for opening weekend at 70ish mil. I'm hoping for a 100+. I'm seeing it tomorrow for sure. Been a while since I've been excited for a horror movie.&&Casting the adults for the next movie is going to be a nightmare. &&Yea, my theater was not prepared for that crowd&&Not only does it have creepy imagery, but it manages to be sooo much fun! Hopefully the sequel will be as good or on par with the first. &&I thought everything was perfectly done in this movie. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. The directing was perfect. The casting, the dialogue, everything. I don't think there's a horror movie that exists that has been made like this before. It's like it a film you'd expect to be nominated for awards, but it's an absolutely fucked up and sick story about this dimensional being that loves eating children because they're easier to scare and fear makes them taste better. The ways he scares these kids with their own worst fears and how powerful he is, along with the fact that adults can't see any of it or help the children, just shows how helpless these kids feel. 

I'm very happy to have contributed to this opening night record because this should help more companies realize how much people and horror fans want to see quality horror films that actually have people who truly care about their work being put into a film and making it great. I'm really hoping more horror of this quality, like IT and Get Out, get made. Excellent movie, but please read the book or at least watch the 1990 mini series before seeing the new IT cause I know too many people went to see it thinking it was just a new simple horror movie about a killer clown and have no idea what the story actually is and all the work that went into it and all the subtle hints thrown in to the background. &&Looks like them paying off all of those ""killer clowns"" in the woods that made national news paid off&&youll float too&&Hey I'm in this movie! If you see any blue band members, one of them is me!

Edit: Because this got some traction,shout out to the Burlington Teen Tour Band, the band that got hired to do these few scenes. We were also invited to attend the  2017-2018 Rose Parade! &&It's doing well.&&Looks like R-rated horror is back on the menu, boys!&&anyone else notice when ben was reading through the history of Derry the librarian was like staring/smirkin at him in the background while the balloon floated? &&We can only hope that this encourages production of more quality R rated films&&Watched this on LSD

That's helping.&&I've never been to a movie where the crowd had more camaraderie.

She honestly asked me if I want to leave the theater.&&Glad to hear it. This film for sure deserves it... no pun intended.&&There you have it: the cure for the summer drop in box office tickets?

I haven't seen it yet, but it's just so disappointing with what could have been done with that movie. Oh well, ka is a wheel amirite?&&As someone who doesn't generally like horror movies due to their often emphasis of 'jump scares', is this movie still worth it?  I loved 'Stranger Things', 'Alien', and the original IT, so not against horror movies if done right, just want to steer clear of lazy jump scares and stuff that has been done to death.&&This will hit home that Hollywood needs REMAKES SET IN THE 80S, STAT!&&The people behind me nearly ruined this movie by constantly talking (loudly) and laughing at the worst times, but this movie was so good that even those assholes couldn't ruin it completely!
Also PSA if you can't keep your shit together even a little bit during a horror movie don't go see a horror movie 

Edit: what was everyone's favorite scene (without spoiling anything). I personally found the library scene the most terrifying...&&For those that have it. Can you use your moviepass for this?&&Saw this last night in IMAX.
Loved it.
Never read the book but now I feel utterly compelled to do so.&&Maybe this will finally show the film execs that their idea of a golden movie formula isn't worth shit. People want scary, crazy, controversial, epic. We aren't as impressed with visuals and billion dollar effects as they think we are, we want a good solid story. The film industry is having its standards lifted and I think that's awesome, laughing at how confusing this must be for the Michael Bays of the world &&I'm happy with the success. However, does anyone else think this strengthens Hollywoods obsession with reebots/remakes?&&What is GotG? Can't figure it out too drunk to google.&&The first adaptation fucking terrified me as a child. Can't wait to see how this fares&&Just saw IT at my local theater. The story line is missing a lot and a few major things are different from the book (obviously), but I didn't even care. They did a stellar job with it and I'm eagerly anticipating the next one!&&About to go into the theater, so excited!!&&This movie was incredible. Very rarely do I go into a movie with high expectations and come out satisfied. This adaptation everything I wanted an more. It's an entirely different approach than the mini series. 

My only gripe was the overuse of Pennywise early in the movie. The beauty of IT is the psychological mind games behind tapping into your biggest fears. The producers focused more on jump scares with Pennywise than playing into this. &&🎈&&After I saw this movie I went to my homeboys apartment. I left around 3:45 am, and saw a red balloon tied to someone's fin on their car, then at the first stop sign there was another red balloon, and at the stop sign by my apartment there was another red balloon. Whoever is putting these balloons all over campus got me fucked up on the low &&[deleted]&&I'd be at the cinema right now watching this film if Hurricane Irma would chill out for the weekend.&&the people want R rated movies. &&Imagine being King, almost 70, and having this awesomeness happening, a new generation appreciating your work...just great. He's always been my fave. Thanks for the lost sleep Steve. &&Floridian checking in. Previews start in 9 minutes. If I don't reply around 10PM EST assume Irma accelerated to full throttle and wrecked me.&&Saw it this morning. I liked it. Horror-wise, it really wasn't any different than any other monster/slasher movie but the movie manages to flesh-out most of the characters so you actually care about what happens to them and the ""jump-scares"" that are typical for a movie like this were earned for the most part and never felt ""cheap."" I recommend it, especially if you like watching most horror movies.&&It was amazing! Glad I contributed! 🎈&&Might be because IT was actually a good movie. The children actors were fantastic and the movie somehow got you to laugh and be terrified at the same time. Would definitely watch again.&&Bill Skarsgård nailed the role of Pennywise.  Deff wish he had more dialogue, but overall an excellent horror flick.  I can see him as the new Joker for the Scorsese film.  Tall, lanky guy with a great smile to work with. Especially if they're looking for a young version of the Joker, based in the 80s. He'd be perfect for it.  Already has the clown part down.  Good voice, and the laugh.  Nightmares. &&Yeah, I work in a movie theater. It's the busiest I've ever seen it. But let me tell you, the real scum of the Earth people show up to opening night. It was awful.&&There was one tied on the railing of the bridge by my house last night! I really wanted to look over the edge but I wussed out haha.

Pic of balloon: https://imgur.com/gallery/18yIY&&I think it's actually viral marketing. &&I saw one on my way to drop my kid off at school. Creepy.&&Assuming I survive this fucking hurricane I'll be seeing it as soon as things get at a low enough mad max level for the theaters to be open

Edit: Holy shit, not only am I fine but my building is the only one in the entire town that didn't lose power. There's fucking ripped up trees everywhere and I was playing Sniper Elite all night. We did have flickers but I hooked my ps4 into a backup power supply I swiped from work, so I didn't even have to stop playing, *I am so fucking lucky.*&&Playing the pronoun game ey?&&Also want to say that this movie may very well be one of the best horror movies ever. It's incredibly layered and the acting is phenomenal. Was not prepared for how well thought out this movie was&&How'd it compare to the original and how old are you?&&Yep. Watched it today. It could've been a little bit shorter (maybe 10-15 mins shorter), but the movie was superb. Also gotta love Bill Skarsgard's acting, his character was nothing short of amazing.  
Definitely recommend the movie. &&We rule....I mean float! 🎈&&Hell yeah. But I went to a cinema that was ""sold out"", and don't judge me but I found a way to sneak in... They claimed it was sold out, and had assigned seats, but it was like half full. It was a fucking amazing movie, honestly one of my top 5 all time, but I wonder where they get legitimate numbers from&&I went with my brothers and it was pretty damn intense, funny, and scary. We all had a blast, absolutely no regrets.&&Saw IT last night. Pretty stoked to see IT again. &&Same. Seen it today, and it's the first horror movie I've ever gone to the theaters to see. You'll like it &&Just go see it opening weekend. Watching a horror flick in a packed house is way less scary than watching it at home.&&I have only started to get into horror recently, and have personally gotten into the habit of taking one headphone off when it got too intense. No idea how I'm going to handle this one in theaters but I'm still planning on going for it!&&[deleted]&&> DVD release

What's a DVD?&&They got the overall tone & feel of DT wrong and mashed too much story together.  Too bad they squandered the talented cast.&&The Dark Tower deserves a Game of Thrones style TV show, or at the very least a trilogy. Trying to cram 8 books into a 1.5 hour long movie just isn't going to happen. 

I really liked Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba in their roles too. Such a waste and a disappointment. I guess I'll just read the books again. &&Dark tower Sony. IT WB. THEY are different.&&What Dark Tower movie? I don't know about any Dark Tower movie. Never heard of it. 

^Let's ^keep ^it ^like ^that, ^okay?&&Have you seen the 1990 miniseries. I've seen both versions. The new film is way better overall than the 1990 version, but I think Tim Curry's Pennywise is better, partly because he gets more dialogue.  Perhaps IT Part 2 (which is coming) will improve things. &&[deleted]&&I loved that part too! I was almost disappointed that they gave it away in the trailer, but then it gets *so much fucky-er*.  In fact, none of the best scares are in the trailer, which I was SO happy with. I'm also surprised at how far they took the opening scene with Georgie. I nearly cried!&&I thought it was so stupid how after every encounter with this supernatural being, they just brush it off like nothing happened. 

I know it's a movie but holy hell put some weight behind this stuff, a person would be absolutely traumatized by something like that but they open the garage door and they're just like ""wow that was close call wow""&&I'm happy to hear that, his books are incredibly hard for film adaptation, especially this one (I mean the fifth grade gangbang in the sewer wasn't going to be included). However I did like The Stand, granted it was only a TV movie, but the four hour run time really told the story. Granted you can't always go with a four hour movie. I forget there were 2 others, The Langoliers? And the one with people's teeth falling out? &&George of the Gungle*&&Can anyone please tell me what GotG 2 is? I still don't know... &&There is. Do not watch it.&&There is a George of the Jungle 2. It didn't have Brendan Fraser and was awful.&&The cinematography was fucking amazing too. I don't even know that much about how that process works, but dear lord every shot was just... right. It blew my fuckin mind.&&The actor from Stranger Things definitely killed it.&&Expected the gif of pennywise doing the dance in his little sewer carnival place&&That actor nailed Pennywise&&The horror of well disguised clickbait! &&They don't have a subtitled version? Here in Spain I was able to watch it in english with spanish subtitles. &&google for a cinema that shows O-ton. whenever i go to the movies its one of two cinemas that show the original versions. unless you live way in the outback somewhere.
&&That...that was me, and I'm a guy &&This is why I probably won't see it in theaters. I'm not paying money to stare at my hand for a couple of hours.&&Mvp&&Don't know if we'll get 100+ with the hurricane unfortunately. Pretty much the entire state of Florida is gonna be shut down this weekend.&&Same. Approximately 800 tickets sold for opening night. We ended up having to open another showing as not to turn hundreds of people away.&&youll float too!&&GAZEBOS&&That scene where Ritchie is trying to take the French horn from the marching band guy while the rest of them were having a conversation was hilarious. &&So glad you made it out alive.&&Indeed. &&When pg-13 horror is done right it's ok. I for one love cursing in a movie though, makes it seem more real. The only thing I'm kind of over is over the top gore.&&I'm not sure what you would consider ""quality"" or where you got this idea that there's a lack of quality R-rated films. There are plenty of quality R-rated films every year. &&Afraid this will rather encourage production of more remakes&&And if they don't it won't take long for a fan to re-cut it&&I don't know shit about cinematography, and It was a fucking beautiful movie. Once you start kind of realizing how they put it together I very honestly have no problem saying it's a masterpiece. Again, I'm no expert, but it was reallllllly impressive to the point that a novice could tell how impressive the camera work was.&&See what?&&Well do you have a second date planned?&&Seriously, talking about this movie to anyone feels like that Abbot and costello.

""I went and watched it last night""

""What did you see last night?""

""It""

""Right, what movie?""

""I saw it""

""I know you saw it, but what movie.""

""exactly""&&It took me waaaaaay too long to figure out what the pun was. &&No It is evil, feasts on kids...&&What is the series, like, 10,000 plus pages? There's no way they could make that one good, 90 minute movie.  Its just not possible. &&Except IT is really good and the Dark Tower was hot garbage. &&It's definitely not just lazy jump scares. There's a good deal of body horror and whatnot with what Pennywise turns into, and just really disturbing imagery. It doesn't rely on jump scares at all.&&I think they got the idea from stranger things&&GAZEBOS&&The flute playing woman... The fridge was a close second. &&Ritchie trying to take the french horn from the guy made me crack up!&&I don't get them people. There was a few sat near me last night, talking through the film. If you don't want to be there, fuck off. No one thinks you're cool for talking. 

Hard to pick a favourite scene. But the projector part i loved. Especially when he jumps out of it and he is huge. &&I think this was a case where a reboot actually needed to happen. The miniseries did the book no justice, this try was leagues better.&&Eh. I'd rather see a remake of a 27-year-old miniseries than Transformers 18: The Transformening. If a story is strong, remaking it isn't an issue.&&The 1990 version was a mini series on TV. Not sure if this is technically a reboot/remake. &&They've been doing this for a lot longer than you think.

In fact the first remade film was back in 1904, *The Great Train Robbery*. It was literally made to profit off the back of the original which was made only the year before.

So in essence, remaking films is a 100+ year old tradition.

EDIT:

As an aside, how do you feel about cover songs?

I feel like if a band can't make their own music then they shouldn't be able to profit on achievements of others by doing covers.&&Guardians of the Galaxy 2&&Game of thrones: go&&It's fuckin creepy. Not the kind that makes you lose sleep, but in a good way that lends itself to the movie altogether. Trust me, it won't be what you expected, but at the same time it'll be awesome&&> The story line is missing a lot

ive never read the original book but throughout the movie i kept getting the feeling that some parts were skipped/rushed over

but its a 2 hour movie wiithout a minute wasted so idk what else they couldve done&&rip&&im alive fam, gf wanted to grab food so we did that.
movie was amazing, deserves all the positive ratings it got/will continue to get!&&Missed your chance to float.&&Not all of it. I live in a tiny mountain (town*) and someone took it upon themselves to put some up yesterday. no big wigs or agenda, just excited fans :)&&Don't end up floating down there man!&&Same. I've been waiting months for this movie and it finally comes out to excellent reviews and fucking Irma is here to wreck the weekend.&&Hello fellow Floridian! Stay safe!&&please don't die <3&&Don't worry. You'll float! We all float!&&We'll be very good swimmers by the time this is over though.&&You'll float, too.&&*ding*&&I don't know a damn thing about cinematography, but that camera work was absolutely fucking incredible. If Chung doesn't get an oscar I might cry&&The kid who plays Richie was hilarious, and Beverley is going to be a superstar. &&with no spoilers, how scary was it? I usually don't like horror movies, but it looks like this is a really great movie, so I might go see it.

For reference, the only other horror movies I watched are The shining (i didnt find it scary at all actually. ) and alien (which was scarrier, but still fine to me)&&Not OP but 28 yr old who grew up watching it once a year in a home that worshipped Stephen King.


Some things are completely different (the old house, the monsters used), some things are further explored and explained (e.g. alot more Pennywise dialog and interaction, visual explanations as to what is done to victims, etc), and a few nostalgic quotes or details are intact (""my heart burns there too"", ""you worry me Bevvy"" etc)

I didn't like that they showed some scenes that weren't necessar. It's ok to let imagination take care of some aspects! CG wasn't always necessary at points it was used as well. But those are my only complaints.

That said- I dare say I love it *more*. I wish whoever did this had been part of the creative team that helped with the Evil Dead remake. I was so afraid it would shit on a huge piece of nostalgia for me. I hate most CG and was worried about how itd be used in the film as well. And it legit frightened me. I screamed several times. And it had surprising and good quality humor interwoven into all the fear and the  drama. 

 I ended up truly loving it. I'm so sad my mom didn't live to see this remake, it would have blown her mind. &&Just my two cents, I'm not OP: I'm 29, and rewatched the original for the first time in forever last weekend before seeing the new film last night. In my mind, it's a very different movie. The original wasn't a comedy at all, and this movie definitely goes for laughs, like, a lot. The biggest blunder of the new movie in my opinion was the music - some of the scenes had songs in them that were just incredibly out of place, and some of the scares would have been much creepier and more effective if they hadn't been telegraphed with extremely loud ""scary"" music. Still thoroughly enjoyed the new film, but it's not very comparable to the old one in any sense other than that they both hit some of the same story points in a barebones way.&&I watched the TV miniseries when it originally aired when I was a first grader, I read the book in middle school, and I just got back from the movie an hour ago. Definitely going to have to watch it again before it's out of theaters. I think it did a much better job of capturing the darkness of the book. There are definitely a lot of moments of levity as others have stated. But this amounts to good pacing. If you think back to the book and the miniseries, they always tell you that Richie is the funny guy, but he's only funny to the other characters and not the audience/readers. In this adaptation his character is actually pretty funny. There was a very important moment for the formation of the losers club that the director chose to show in a much different way than a fan of IT might expect. I for one absolutely loved the different approach and the rest of the theater seemed to as well, but I can see how somebody might appreciate it. All in all this a great film. Go see it.&&I'm 40, and the new one blows the old one out of the water in every way possible. &&Not OP, I'm 37. I've read the book and seen the made for TV movie multiple times. This new movie was far and away better in every way.&&>the original 

This is a new adaptation of the book, not a remake of the 1990 made for TV miniseries. They are completely different. The new film is more faithful to the book in terms of its tone and writing. Pennywise isn't acting silly all the time like Tim Curry (a performance I enjoyed but it really didn't capture the sinister nature of IT from the book) and we actually get to hear and see the more disturbing things the book touches on that the 90s miniseries couldn't really. 

&&Shorter? How earth did they cram the whole story and character developments of a miniseries into a movie-length feature (I haven't seen it yet).&&I'm not a horror guy but this movie interests me. After watching the trailer I had a nightmare about it the next night so is this movie gonna fuck me up if I go to see it?&&Can I float too?&&Report how well you sleep tonight &&What did you see?&&Watched The (American remake of) Ring opening weekend in a packed theater. The startled screams that rippled through the audience when she ""flickered/teleported"" after crawling out of the tv, followed by a wave of laughter, is one of my fondest memories.&&I gotta disagree. A big part of what freaked me out about Paranormal Activity was the crowd full of people losing their shit around me. That, and the deafening silence as the people filed out of the theater at the end. &&But what if It's waiting for you behind every empty seat?&&This helped me so much with Annabelle. I despise jump scare movies but I went with my fiance and the theater was packed. Luckily, there was a younger sassy black guy sitting close to us. ""Oh shit nigga, damn!"" and ""Run bitch!"" are two statements that have never been so calming before. &&Yep I went and seen it last night and laughter that always comes after the scares really takes away from the scariness of it. I *loved* this movie, but I won't ever watch a horror movie on release night again. &&I always get my dog next to me ;) he always realises when I watch scary movies because he get 1000x more ear scratches haha&&I'm in the same boat as well, except I'm really afraid of clowns. I'm going to see it with my new gf on Sunday.

Semd help.&&I'm going in a couple hours and I HATE jump scares. Can't wait to shit myself.&&Wear headphones to the theater and when it gets too intense take one out&&IT isn't a horror movie. It's more of a coming of age movie. Really isn't scary at all. It is actually quite a funny movie.&&It's like a really flat VHS cassette.&&Man, ain't that the truth. So much talent and potential wasted. &&Id be happy with a castlevania style anime honestly &&Tim Curry's Pennywise was funnier and made more specific comments to each kid (""Kiss me, fatboy!""). But the new Pennywise is more menacing.&&Excuse me sir, do you have Prince Albert in a can? &&I am quite fond of IT both the books and movie/mini series. I think while there is a classic charm to Tim Curry's version, this Pennywise is so much more accurate to the original book version. This is what I pictured when reading the book. &&I think Pennywise is more vocal with the kids when they're adults. When they're kids, he doesn't really pay much attention to them until the attack at the house on Neibolt Street. When they're adults, though - he has some beef with them, and shit-talks them a lot.&&I was watching the Georgie scene thinking, ""oh he'll just get pulled in any second and we won't see anything as usual."" Then that bite! After that scene I knew this movie was a totally different animal. Loved it.&&When I read the book for the first time, I didn't really know what I was getting into. Georgie's death scene was like a slap in the face and really let me know what kind of experience I was going to have.

I was really happy when they didn't shy away from that scene in the movie. It wasn't exactly the same, but that key detail was there and they gave you a reeeeal good look at it. I imagine anyone not familiar with the material will experience the same shock I felt when reading it, and that makes me happy.&&I sort of figured it was because they had all individually witnessed Pennywise, where the weight was already there, after their first encounter. So they already knew ""It"" was there. At that point they were fucking hunting ""it"". They're not gonna hunt, and be afraid.&&I actually agree with you. Loved the movie, but I was curious as to how these kids could act like there wasn't some demon clown terrorizing their town. It was like a work day for them. ""Welp, we are done for the day. See you guys tomorrow."" Okay, bro. You almost got killed.&&[deleted]&&Pet cemetery? Stand by me? Cujo? Carrie? The shining? Granted king hated kubrik's film, but it's still considered one of the greats.

Edit:

Shawshank Redemption, the Green Mile, the Mist, the Dead Zone are all good to great films that are based on Stephen king writings.

Even the Salem's Lot miniseries was pretty good.

More edits:

Secret Window, Children of the Corn, Apt Pupil,  Dolores Claiborne, Misery, and 1408 are all solid to great films based on his writings.&&The Tommyknockers &&> (I mean the fifth grade gangbang in the sewer wasn't going to be included)

Que?&&The Stand is frustrating to me, because it has one of the all time greatest castings: Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg.

But also one of the all time worst castings: Molly Ringwald as Franny.&&The Stand was pretty damn good for a TV movie, though I admit I kind of laugh during the opening when it pans through the labs while Don't Fear the Reaper plays. &&Guardians of the Galaxy 2&&Your mom killed it last night! Am I right boys &&I for one, am looking forward to all the IT gifs that will come out soon&&That was probably the creepiest part of the movie to me. He is just dancing and he isn't smiling or anything, and there's just weird shit going on in the background. It was just fucking creepy. I am definitely looking forward to chapter 2.&&I want a gif of him waving with that severed hand to Mike down by the river. So fucked up and unsettling&&Best part of the movie, I was laughing uncontrollably but was so disturbed, the ridiculous one move dance along with his stone cold face killed me&&Bill Skarsgård. He fucking killed it. &&The way the smile just...blooms out of his otherwise impassive face, like a mask he's decided to put on. So subtly inhuman. &&He did. It was just different enough than Curry's but also just similar enough to be perfect.&&Germany is well known for dubbing rather than subtitling despite an ok-isg level of English proficiency.

They even have their own awards shows for voice over artists, and the same people tend to do the voices for the same actors each time, so for example one bloke will always do Brad Pitt, and he's famous for it.

I would prefer subtitles if it was me but there must be some appeal ans affection in Germany for dubbing!&&My girlfriend wants to see it.  If we see it in theaters together, that's much more likely to be me than her.  She's both more into horror and much less squeamish than me.&&We had the same problem. Line was trailing around the block, sold all 850 seats available, and still had to turn people away. We haven't had an opener like this in years.&&[deleted]&&You'll float too!&&The French horn players name is Owen!

There are plenty of quality R rated films, but not a ton of R rated films themselves, at least among big name blockbusters.&&[deleted]&&What I refer to is the fact that there are a lot of pg-13 films that could have improved with the freedom of an R rating&&It's not a remake, it's another adaptation of the same work. &&I consider this more of an adaptation than a remake &&It's not a remake though, it's an adaptation of the novel. 

The ""original"" movie that everyone talks about was actually a tv mini series, and it was extremely poorly done. &&They hired Korean cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung who worked on Vengeance trilogy(Oldboy), Thirst and lately The Handmaiden.    

This is no coincidince ""IT"" looks visually striking, those movies are so beautiful. &&It.&&That's why always say the full ""Stephen Kings IT""&&Should have been an HBO miniseries.&&It's not an adaptation though. It's a sequel. So.... that was an interesting idea, but it was very, very poorly executed. &&Cool, I think I will give it a shot!&&The original plan was to make Part 1 and 2 simultaneously.

So they choose 1989 because 27 years would be 2016

I'm glad they didn't go that route and I'm sort of glad Fukunaga left the project.&&Oh god that fridge scene was fucked.&&Ritchie killed it throughout the entire film&&Has it really been 27 years? Funny coincidence if so.&&It's not a remake. It's an adaptation of the novel.

I'm a huge fan of the old ones and I loved it &&I had the same reservation about the music. FEEL CREEPED OUT NOW says the music. Uh, thanks music. There's a red balloon floating in a library and no one else can see it and the librarian is super weird. I was feeling pretty creeped out already. Take it easy.&&Gunna be honest the only real complaint I had with this movie was the sound, it just felt ""off"" the entire time. . .The whole Georgie and sewer grate scene [which was partially in the trailer] when you first become aware of the supernatural it plays this shrill sound - Now I'm used to horror movies using sound to tone up ""scares"" but that sound just felt out of place. . 

**more spoilers ahead**

Same thing when it came to the voices in the sink drain, they just felt out of place. . Not the fact that there were voices at all, but just the voices they used felt off and wrong for the part.

Same thing when Stanley all out yells at Bill later in the movie and flips out after their first encounter in the house. It straight up felt like all of that audio was added after the scene was shot and nobody bothered to sink it up to anybody, it didn't even sound at all like the actor playing him the whole time.


With all that said Pennywise was really fucking well done - He had a cool ""happy"" and ""fun"" vibe to him but at the same time ""creep you the fuck out cause something is wrong"".&&What I really like about the new one more is the cinematography.&&This is basically the first half of the book, if it does well they will probably do the second half. &&ah yea you know it! Step 1 is to crawl into a sewer though...&&I actually slept super well and they did too. If I went alone, I don't think I'd have as good as a time as we did together. We were all scared shitless at some scenes while laughing together about it. Great time.&&I saw it last night, made it home by one (late showing), and wasn't able to fall asleep until three. No regrets, I absolutely loved the movie. &&For me the worst that happened was waking up in the middle of the night and having spooky pennywise visions that made it hard to fall back asleep. Otherwise, dreams and sleep were super duper! 😃&&IT&&I can say the same for the opening weekend of Cabin in the Woods. I don't think anybody really knew what to expect from the movie because the trailers showed so little about what it was actually about. One of the most satisfying experiences with a packed theater.&&So I was on a date with a girl that worked at Software Etc. (or EB Games, or Game Stop I don't remember. It was like 15 years ago) in the mall. She was this super petite white girl, very modest and awkward and shy.

Anyway she gets up to go to the bathroom during The Grudge. There was a big mf dude sitting at the end of our row, and when she came back she had to tap him on the shoulder to get by. He yelped so loud. It was so funny.

Also, during the movie a scene startled me so badly that when I opened my mouth to scream it was quiet. That was a weird feeling       &&I saw The Ring twice with full theatres. The first time, the entire audience was abnormally silent, just gasps and shock. The feel of it was palpable and very intense. Unlike anything I've seen before or since.

The second time, I saw it with screamers. Equally fun for different reasons.&&No lie, last night I had the strongest urge to reach out and brush the hair of the guy in front of me when the music was all intense and suspenseful but I decided against a possible punch in the face and creating a scene. &&[Uh, no](http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/evil-clown-gif.gif)&&idk why you're getting downvotes. This is hilarious.&&Humans can lick hands too&&My wife is scared of clowns too but I talked her into seeing it. Now I won't be the little sissy boy at the scary movie for a change! I've read the book, I know generally how things are going to go, I'm really looking forward to this &&The jump scares are actually really well done. There is definitely more creepy scenes than jump scares.&&Id say it's both. &&Finally someone said it. The clown/IT is a secondary antagonist. The real horror is growing up and realizing that adults are just as helpless as children. &&It certainly scared the shit out of me lol.&&What's a VHS cassette?&&Not nearly as ridiculous as it initially sounds.&&Agreed. I re-watched the 1990 version as a warm up for the new film. I forgot how funny Curry is, while still seeming completely unhinged at the same time.&&Uh-ha Uh-ha Uh-ha Uh-ha Uh-ha &&Beep beep Ritchie.&&Can you explain what exactly it showed, how graphic it was?&&I think it's because all of them already live in terror. Most of the group is facing danger every day. It's kind of their natural state. Bill is dealing with the murder of Georgie and is basically on his own with no support or protection from his family. Bev is being molested and beaten at home. Eddie is being forced into EXTREME hypochondria. Ben literally gets carved on by a bunch of bullies, one of whom is completely psychotic and another of whom is a sociopath. Those same bullies are constantly coming after Mike, Stanley and Richie. Mike, by the way has watched his parents die. 

I think Bill says it best when he's standing in front of the door to the house on Neibolt street and he tells everyone that it's easier to walk into that house then it is to walk into his own. I think that's part of what makes the losers club so strong. They have to protect each other because their parents wont, and that bond is what makes them stronger than IT. &&I think the fact that the adults don't see what's happening makes the kids not speak up. &&You explained it way better than I could have.&&Pet sematary is very underrated the zelda's scene still give me nightmare&&Gerald's Game is coming to Netflix real soon.&&Misery was pretty good too, although the movie left out the ""drinking his own piss"" part.&&I didn't mean his other adaptations were bad, there's just a better opportunity to tell a story with the allotted run time (even for a TV movie). Christine was great, I also liked Maximum Overdrive, albeit campy as fuck. Any art form is subjective to the viewer, not necessarily right or wrong, it just appeals to a particular group. &&Needful things was pretty good too.&&*The Mist* is a great adaptation, and I believe King said he liked the movie's ending better than his own ending. It's so fucked up, with a little bit of bittersweetness.&&He's making shit up, there's no gangbang in the sewer.

It's a TRAIN BABY&&Stephen King did a lot of cocaine back in the day&&In the book the kids all bang each other to help fight Pennywise.&&All the kids have sex because they think it will help them to find their way out of the sewer. &&I didn't think she was bad as Franny. &&And  Rob Lowe as Nick

so good&&I mean that's straight outta the book, why laugh?&&Movie is a gold mine of gif material.&&https://i.imgur.com/LudRoLc.gifv&&I just got out of the movie about an hour and a half ago . At the end when it says ""IT Chapter One"" someone not far from me said ""There's a part two ?"" The person next to them said ""Yeah didn't you read the book?""&&I want to know that chapter 2 is most definitely happening.&&The use of camera stabilization and some visual effects is pretty excellent when Pennywise is the subject of a shot, really good work on that front. &&My skin is crawling. Scariest part for me was the kids brother becoming increasingly demonic in the basement filled with water &&I hate horror movies with a passion but seeing comments like this make me want to go just so I can get it over with and be part of the club that's seen the movie. But then my rational mind kicks in and tells me that I'll be scared shitless of any normal thing that he's appeared in in the movie like storm drains for years.&&Okay, I literally laughed out loud in that part. Pennywise honestly just looked so fucking goofy.&&>>to Mike down by the river.

Was Mike a motivational speaker by any chance?&&""Bill's gonna kill you"" &&Is he related to Stellan? &&I for one welcome our new Swedish overlords. I wonder how tall he was with all the Pennywise get up. He's 6'5"" without it.&&I just googled him. I did not expect him to be that fucking fine. &&I was trying to explain this to my friend, selling the movie.   Its like, uncanny valley.  Its so close to human, but not, and yeah.  its supper effective. &&I watched Netflix's [3 Percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3%25) before Netflix had English dubs. Wife and I always watch dubs because we hate reading while we watch TV, and were disappointed it had no dubs.

Mid-way through our watch, Netflix released the dubs and we tried them out. Two minutes in, we had to switch back to subs. The voices and the acting just weren't right ... it felt like an entirely different show. Now I'm glad we started with subtitles.&&Do you even know what Morgan Freeman sounds like?&&You'll float too!&&YOU'LL FLOAT TOO! &&Tell Owen he's a prick for me. I'm his oathenaise.&&Like everything else, there's shit movies in every rating. I'd argue that there's more shit movies in the PG-13 range because a great deal are R rating films that toned it down to be more marketable, but that could just be saturation bias.

There are, in my opinion, as many, or more, R films that just go for the vulgarity and violence to be obscene. And lack the tact to be a R rated property due to content within the narrative, and instead focus on being R rates for the content about the narrative.

I loved Logan. I also feel like they got a bit heavy handed with everyone saying fuck because they were so happy to get license to be vulgar with wolverine. Good movie, didn't detract from the film. 

This film has plenty of vulgarity with the children, but it's perfect (maybe too perfect) in its application ""if you say it's summer one more fucking time..."" instead of kids saying fuck every other word to be edgy.

Same goes for the violence. Pennywise is violent only in direct application to actions that serve its purpose. He doesn't slice people up to look evil.

I'd say the actions and dialogue fitting the characters is what makes this stand out where something like the later Saw movies failed.&&I know, but what movie will he be seeing?&&Same with World War Z.  I liked the movie for what it was, but it shouldve been a miniseries based on the book.&&There are definitely some jump scares but they all feel earned. No ""**LOUD DEMON NOISE** *oh it was a cat*"" scenes and they almost always happen when you already know something's up.&&Weirdly, yeah, minus a couple months - the miniseries aired in November 1990.

I'm surprised more marketing hasn't alluded to the coincidence there.&&I love Modest Mouse!  Wait......never mind. &&I think that's called a hill.&&Ah my apologies, I was a bit off in my understanding &&*And when you're down here, with me...* &&*manatee&&And the pennyeise trailer scene where hes dancing, fucking phenomenal &&I thought it was effective&&Part 2 was already confirmed. 
Edit: Just saw IT last night, blew away all my expectations.&&WHAT?&&yeah--that one was great fun with a crowd.  Jurassic Park (the first one) was a blast on opening weekend--people screaming and throwing popcorn everywhere (unintentionally) during the T-Rex scene is one of my favorite crowded theater moments.&&I saw Cloverfield on opening night. That was another flick no one knew anything about. And it was fucking wild. &&Silent screams are the best.&&She worked at babbage's. &&My mom,  two young cousins,  and I went to see The Grudge in theaters and I was sitting by the youngest cousin who was maybe 12 at the time.  She was nervously snacking on popcorn for awhile and the attic scene came up (very scary scene). She was on pins and needles watching it when some guy in the row behind us put his foot up on the armrest beside her and startled her so bad she threw her popcorn and screamed. Lol I still tease her about that to this day. &&Ty for the story &&Good thing you didn't. Let people enjoy the film.&&I didn't downvote but maybe because a packed house would imply that there are no empty seats?&&Fuck you man....fuck you&&That story always used to scare the hell out of me as a kid lmao&&That's just gross though. It's only adorable when it's an animal with the habit of licking it's own butt.&&There's a fair few scary scenes that aren't in the book though, so you're not totally safe I'm afraid! The movie is fucking great though.&&I don't know the difference between good and bad jump scares. All I know is they startle me really bad.&&What do you mean by well done? Will I still shit myself, or are they telegraphed pretty well?&&Of course it is. These people are nuts.&&Looking forward to the sequel where they grew into helpless adults.


It would be hilarious if they actually cast Molly reingwald as adult Beverly hahaha&&> The clown/IT is a secondary antagonist.

Maybe for the book (haven't read it) but in the movie I actually felt the growing up and adult stuff, while definitely an important part of the movie, took the back burner compared to It itself. &&[deleted]&&I've never seen the 1990 version, but this new Pennywise reminded me more of a demon than a person. I really enjoyed it, regardless of that.&&""Do you have Prince Albert in a can? You do? Well you better let him out! Haha! Haha! Haha! Haha!""&&Pennywise opens his mouth and it's full of sharp teeth that extend out sort of like the alien's (from Alien). He bites Georgie's arm, then we see Georgie crawling away from the drain, screaming, one-armed with a gaping wound, and bleeding heavily. A hand extends out from the drain as he tries to crawl and pulls him inside, leaving a trail of blood. Opening title.&&Mike also has to kill sheep all day &&Love this take on it, thanks for sharing.&&Yes, this was covered a lot more in the book.  The point in the movie that references that... [was the scene where Bev is in the bathroom and blood covers everything.  In the book, when the group cleans it up, they take the bloody towels/clothes to a laundromat and clean them there, but only they see the blood.  But more to it, Derry itself is an unsettling place; the adults aren't necessarily ignorant of the violence, but rather turn a blind eye to it.  But It has a lot of power and can sway people (Bev's dad, the kids' success as adults, Henry, etc), so when these kids begin to see all of this and recognize that no one ""cares"", they begin to realize there is really no one they can talk to but each other.](#spoiler)&&Pet Semetary is the first horror movie I ever watched. It came on tv late at night and I watched it because the word cemetery was misspelled and I wanted to know why. 

Good Movie. &&Seriously? That's going to be hard to adapt, but I'm very, *very* interested to see what they do with it. It's one of my favorite King books. &&And the ""chopping off his feet"" part.&&Misery is such a fantastic movie. It's such a strange form of agonizing horror. I can't look at Bates without thinking of her character in Misery. &&Sure - probably also says something that a lot of the best movies were based on his short stories or novellas rather than his full novels.&&I love Maximum Overdrive. It is very campy, but that's kind of the appeal. Also nostalgia, as I grew up watching it.&&That's much classier. Geeze I was worried there for a second.&&Thank you for clarifying.&&As someone who has no idea what IT is about other than a scary clown...


What

&&Correction: [Bev bangs all of them. It's not *that* progressive.](#spoiler) &&Nope they had already defeated Pennywise by then. It was to find their way back out of the sewer.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3086  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/94100)&&[deleted]&& But it did help them get out..it brought them closer together or some shit...right?&&Worst part of the book in my opinion. &&The entire movie is just chock full of moving images!&&My audience was full of people that had no idea. Terrified reactions followed.&&I heard people say, ""Oh great!  I bet they're going to make like 5 of them!"" And a bunch of people clapped cause they thought Bowers and IT were killed. I'm guessing none of them knew the story at all and didn't know It, along with Henry Bowers, comes back in 27 years when they're 40 years old. &&That scene was the scariest to me. But what also freaked me the hell out was when Georgie was sobbing and trying to drag himself into the middle of the road with only ONE arm...and then IT's arm stretched way tf out of the drain and yanked Georgie screaming down the drain 😰 I was internally screaming so loud. &&I'm pretty sure IT was using Georgie (or his manifestation of him) as a ventriloquist doll too. As IT's face surfaces his arm raises out of the water and is clearly holding Georgie off the ground, and you see Pennywise mouthing but not speaking Georgie's words, that's all kinds of fucked up.  &&I found a lot of the movie to be that way; some odd combination of horrifying, hilarious and, I dont know... intriguing? Definitely not something you see often. &&""I am going to Kill Bill!""&&And his brothers are all the Skaarsgards you can think of.&&His son&&https://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/a-brief-guide-to-the-skarsgard-family

We're obviously not the first to need a Skarsgård family tree to reference. Loved Alexander on True Blood.  

Edit: okay, it's kinda gross how this ranks them on hotness; I think we could have all done without that part. &&Probably 6' 7ish""&&You would probably like to watch Hemlock Grove. For research.&&That whole family. . . His brother is Alexander Skarsgård who played Tarzan the new live-action movie and also Eric in True Blood. Definitely got some good genes.&&I thought it was brunchalicious, myself&&Yeah, I enjoyed that about when he talked to Georgie.
Like the longer the conversation went, the harder IT was having keeping it together and maintaining his human appearence. &&Hmm, reverse uncanny valley... Interesting. A human so effective at being inhuman... &&Always watch everything in their original language, always. You'll get used to reading the subs I promise.&&YOU'LL FLOAT TOO! 😡&&**YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!**&&Nope, they're waiting in line at the shore waiting for buffet floodgates to open.&&They did post-stabilization on that shot so his head was stationary while the world moved around it. I thought that was a really cool application for that. Like a snorricam for a wide shot.&&Though I question how well the second half will be received. I feel like a huge chunk of this movie's appeal is derived from its kids-centric plot and a capturing a little bit of that Stranger Things 80s horror nostalgia (though both are better works than simply the nostalgia factor). The sequel will be in the 2010s and be about adults. Will people care? Will it still resonate?&&CHOCOLATE! HE'S SELLING CHOCOLATE!&&I saw Jurassic Park in the theatre too! I was 11 and chewed my fingernails down during the movie.&&Not horror related but the stuck car horn scene of little miss sunshine was one of my fondest movie going experiences... Started with one person laughing ended in the whole cinema crying of laughter. &&Yeah that was a movie you had to experience in theater. Just isn't the same on a small tv at home. When that girls head exploded... People screamed lol&&I think Cloverfield is still my favorite theater experience. It was like being on a goddamn roller coaster. &&It's nice to see this movie has a little cult following these days, but it was absolutely nuts in a theater. One of my favorite movie experiences ever. Rewatching at home felt so lackluster in comparison.

10 Cloverfield Lane will translate better, but that opening scene in a theater was brilliant too.&&What if the seats are packed because it is behind them&&Hahahahaha. Everyone looked at me at the Deli like I was nuts.&&Wait. What story?&&Haha I am a dog person myself...butI was referencing this

https://www.thoughtco.com/humans-can-lick-too-3299487 &&Meaning they don't seem cheap. In a lot of horror movies they use jump scares to build tension because something ""scary"" needs to happen.

The jumps in this film​ actually feel worthwhile, in support of the creepy scenes.

And yes you will startle haha.&&Good jump scares are the ones that aren't fake. 

Fake ones are when it's a cat or the friend that comes up behind someone, stuff like that.

Good jump scares are the ones caused by the thing we're supposed to be afraid of (like the actual monster or ghost).&&So the way I usually describe it is, a good jump scare is one that is built to. Not every tense and unsettling scene needs to end on a jump scare. (Looking at you Conjuring-verse) When you have 3 or 4 scenes in a row that build to a jump scare, that don't have a jump scare, you build the tension and suspense in the audience. You mess with their expectations of what they know about horror movie tropes. 

So after 30-45 minutes of tense build ups with no ""pay off"" when you finally do a jump scare, it has more impact. It's something you've worked towards and built the movie towards.

The Woman in Black is one of the best examples of a horror movie built around jump scares done right. When you finally make it to the end and he stares down the hallway, that whole scene HITS YOU right in the fucking gut. You white knuckle your seat. 

You could look it up, but don't. The scene has no real impact taken out of context with no build up. It's a creepy scene, but after an hour and a half of tension, it elevates it to utterly terrifying. &&Better shit yourself before just in case.&&Meaning they don't seem cheap. In a lot of horror movies they use jump scares to build tension because something ""scary"" needs to happen.

The jumps in this film​ actually feel worthwhile, in support of the creepy scenes.&&Let's be real, Molly Ringwald should play every grown up.&&I would like to see Bill Hader play the adult Richie. &&That's ok. It would be very difficult to portray that in a 2 hour movie. &&Heavy&&To be fair, he is supposed to be more of a demon than a person.

He’s an indescribable, ~~extraterrestrial~~ extra-dimensional being. &&That is exactly what its supposed to be! While Tim Curry's Pennywise was good, he was much more human feeling than the original book Pennywise. He brought too much humor to the clown in my opinion. IT is supposed to be an evil entity masquerading as a clown rather than an actual evil clown. &&Man just reading this gives me the goose pimples that movie was fucking good. &&He also cried for his older brother as he was dragged into the sewer. That was haunting, couldn't stop thinking about it. 

I've got a little 18 month old boy and we are thinking another soon, so that made me a little bit of a bitch for a hot minute. &&While your at it what happens in the projector scene?&&So... why is it misspelled?&&Check out the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twbGU2CqqQU&&Sure, but that hobbling scene was still fucking brutal. &&if I recall correctly It is actually some entity that takes the form of a clown but doesn't have to. It goes after children so imagine they were probably banging to lose their innocence or something? I don't know it's been a while. &&It is an interdimensional entity that feeds on fear. That's why it likes children, they have the purest and most satisfying fear. A scary clown is thus one of its common forms but it also uses a mummy, a werewolf, dead younger brothers, and others. Its natural form is incomprehensible and drives mortals mad to behold. 

The deal with the underage train is that the kids need to lose their innocence to complete their first battle with the creature. &&They need to ""grow up"" and lose their innocence to beat IT. They're kids, that's what they think makes them grown ups, basically, so...sewer sex. 

Also, IT technically isn't a clown, just presents as one sometimes, but that's another whole long explanation. &&**SPOILERS**


Its after they beat pennywise, they all run a train on the girl to make themselves closer so they can escape the sewers. Its the girl's idea and she kinda forces them into it. The book implies that it was necessary. There is a lot of symbolism and macroverse shit in the novel. The door to It even has runes on it.&&""IT"" is so much more than a scary clown. It's basically your worst fear and throughout the story it takes many forms. The most popular form being Pennywise the Clown. &&And finally the akwardness of part 2, when they all meet again in the restaurant, makes sense.&&It signified them growing up, but they actually bang after they defeat IT, when they are trying to get out of the sewers. They were united by a common goal of defeating IT, and once that's done they feel lost, so Bev fucks everyone to bond them again or some shit. && I read it in 5th grade, and 5th grade me disagreed.&&Yeah, I agree that it's pretty unnecessary, but I think people tend to way overblow how bad/prominent it is. It's a few pages in the 1200+ of an otherwise fantastic book, and it bothers me that that's the only part people seem to ever talk about. There are sections that are arguably more fucked up, imo, like Patrick Hockstetter's story.&&THOUSANDS&&Everyone went ""OOOOOOHHHHHHHhhhhh""&&This makes me sad , but I don't expect most of the general audience to have gone and read the book . &&He space jammed him. &&I felt literally the exact same way. I really enjoyed the movie but was rarely scared, more intrigued and entertained.&&Volume 2&&Roll credits! &&Floki, Eric Northman&&They're both in Melancholia together as I recall. As father and son no less. 

Edit: never mind just googled it, that was Alexander Skarsgård, Stellan's other son, who also happens to be fine as hell  &&Fucking Christ ... those notable roles for Stellan are a travesty. &&The only thing I really enjoyed about *HG*.  Well, him and the werewolf transformations.&&You forgot their dad, Stellan, who's a pretty great actor.

Also, Alexander was one of the idiot model roommates in Zoolander. He was skinny as hell back then.&&I do too, about 90% of the time, but sometimes the dubbed performances are very good, and then I don't mind.  Studio Ghibli flicks usually have talented actors doing the dubs. &&live action yes, alot of subtlety. In animated show though its much easier to hide. Most animated shows have fantastic dubs in alot of languages. &&YOu'Ll FloOAt TOo!11!&&🎈&&*tim curry intensifies*&&I don't think manatees eat people...&&Pretty common technique in music videos. Avicii - levels is a pretty good example as well as unedited Footage of a Bear when her twin chases her. Can be comical but very creepy effect &&Correction: the sequel will bounce back and forth between adult time line and kid timeline. It will also more deeply examine the cosmology of this universe and It's origins. &&Yes! I was around 11, too! I saw it with my mom, my siblings and my aunts who were in town. 

My mom was to my right and next to her, two strangers - a woman and a man.
All through the scary scenes the woman is shrieking. Even a quiet scene, I guess she kept expecting something to happen because she'd yelp and moan and then something big happens and she'd go to shrieking again. 

I glanced over at her and then at my mom - she's passed out. Hahahaha, we told her we won't take her to movies anymore, she just falls asleep. &&Her torso explodes. And if you pause it fast enough you can see her rib cage split outward in her silhouette. 

&&My then girlfriend curled up in a ball and tried not to watch because of motionsickness during Cloverfield.  She was a real sweetheart not to drag me away from it. &&That film was so unapologetic. I loved every second. &&Not unless you sit at home with it really loud and turn off all the lights.

10 Cloverfield Lane is horrifying no matter what, though. I watched that movie with a lamp on and somehow that made it worse.&&https://www.thoughtco.com/humans-can-lick-too-3299487&&Really cheep is when the jump scares are accompanied by a loud noise and something suddenly jumping into view.&&Good idea&&That's my secret: I'm always shitting myself.&&Gotcha. So they're sort of built up to as a climax of tension, as opposed to just trying to be the only point of tension&&There's that word again: 'Heavy'. Is there something wrong in the future with the Earth's gravitational pull?&&If you read other King novels, especially ones related to The Dark Tower, IT is a creature from Todash (which, like you said, is the void outside of our reality). Todash space is where all the cool Lovecraftian creatures of his books hang out. The creature that the kids in Derry call ""IT"" is also called a Dandelo, basically a shape shifting monster that lives off of emotions. 

Specifically, laughter and fear.

King really goes into detail on what an odd thing laughter is, and how the things we find funny are usually very dark and morbid in a slightly different light. What we are afraid of can just as easily amuse us. Maybe feelings of fear and laughter aren't as different of emotions as we'd like to think they are?

This Stephen King history lesson has been brought to you by a total nerd.&&>extraterrestrial

Would extradimenaional be a more apt descriptor?&&Yeah, that was the vibe I got and I think they fucking nailed it. I really enjoyed the film, and judging by the ovation afterwards, most people there did as well.&&It's just like the bit in the trailer, but they end up knocking the projector over and think it's done with. It keeps cycling through the slides and he disappears from the images. Then it cycles once more and he's coming out of the projected image like a nightmare 3D film, except now he's also four times bigger because of the aspect of being a blown up image on the wall. All this while crawling towards them (he's too big to stand) and scaring the shit out of them, and the audience.&&I believe in the book it explains that a local cemetery for pets was made by the young children of the town, so they couldn't spell very well when they made the sign.&&There was a pet cemetery near where Stephen King was living. The owner of the property had a local boy make the sign, and spelling wasn't his strong suit, so it became a 'sematary.' If you haven't seen the documentary about Pet Sematary called Unearthed and Untold, I highly recommend it. It's on Amazon Prime at the moment.&&Oh shit. That looks genuinely terrifying. That's one of his book's I've never bothered reading.

If you've never read The Dark Tower books they tie his entire mythological universe together. So, ya know, if you have the time to read 8000 pages you should pick it up the next time you plan to be stranded on a desert island.

"‘It’ Tops $500 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing horror film ever.",47703,7332lu,http://variety.com/2017/film/box-office/it-500-million-worldwide-box-office-1202575648/,2527,1506632477.0,,"Movie studio execs: ""This film was a total success, financially and popularly. Let's change the formula, refuse to pay the director, writers, and crew more so we have to hire new ones, and make sure that we control the editing process for the next one.""&&And off of a $35 million dollar budget, it's beyond impressive. I still think it might have legs leading up to Halloween, as well. Pretty smart how they positioned it's opening. &&I'm still kind of in shock that it made that much. Like, good for it, I loved the movie, but it's just *wow* that's a lot of money for a horror movie. Or any movie, really. It's in pretty close company with some movies that I thought were really big. Happy for the whole cast and crew.&&Stupid clickbait headline. Just tell us the name of the movie. &&I feel like this could have either of two consequences. Either it inspires studios to greenlight more horror in general and we potentially get some great new films or it'll reinforce the idea that remaking/rebooting things that are already successful is still a good idea.

I'm hoping for the former but I'm expecting the latter. Ball's in your court Hollywood.&&>The film has plenty of gas in the tank, too, as it has yet to open in Germany, Italy, and Japan.

Soon IT will begin its assault on the Axis powers...&&I really hope the kids are getting bonuses&&No doubt we're going to start seeing copycats now; my question is what will studios attempt to draw from this?

Are we gonna get more scary clowns? More pseudo 80s horror? More lovecraftian monsters? More groups of child actors? More adaptations of old horror books? 

There's a whole lot of terrible shit that could arise from attempting to crib off of IT.&&The marketing for this film was absolutely next level. I still watch the trailers for the film while on YT they're that good. The hype was insane and paid off in every way. 

Also stranger things success definitely helped.&&Obligatory ""what about when you adjust for inflation?"" comment.&&What is S.King's cut from this? I hope he signed on for royalty.&&I can believe it. Kingsmen may have grossed more this weekend than IT, but only by 9 million or so. 

And my theatre had way more people this weekend for IT than Kingsmen. &&Cue the *It is overrated* comments.&&Can't wait to see all the so bad it's good horror movies that are going to come of this, and hopefully some more hits like IT. I'm a huge fan of horror (all horror, love the cheesy, b- stuff) and it's really a genre lacking in interest from the industry because it's seen as not being a money maker.&&Regardless of how you feel about the movie, this is a great thing for horror. 

For the past decade or so, studios have been much too afraid to produce mid-budget genre films ... Which is why you've seen so many movies made for sub 10. With IT's success, we can expect to see more money put into these films and some famous spec scripts previously thought to cost too much to earn a greenlight.&&Just saw it tonight on a weekday and the theater had quite a few other people, I was surprised 

Do recommend, it was solid. It's not going to scare your dick off by any means but it was a good movie about friendship starring a goofy-ass, at times scary, clown.&&I'm so giddy the Oldboy cinematographer took part in this hit.&&IT came out at the best possible time, lots of mediocre movies this summer and it blew everything out of the water.

Really happy this did well.&&I thought it was more funny than scary, though. &&I had a coworker a few days ago *insist* to me that the original IT was better, and that Tim Curry was a more frightening Pennywise. I took those as fighting words.&&There is almost no way WB doesn’t see these numbers and milk IT, changing the movie count to 3.

There is more than enough material to cover it, even the first movie, despite a long run time,barely scratched the surface on the material quantity.&&Cinematographer Chung Hoon Chung ( Old Boy )is killin' it this year as well.  He just shot  ""The Current War"" which comes out later this year.&&I haven't seen this discussion anywhere else and the limited research I've done on the subject hasn't produced much but does anyone else think the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" playing at the theater in Derry is more than a coincidence? 

I mean, Pennywise and Freddy Kruger have the same powers (feeding off fear) and I wonder if there is a connection between the two behind the scenes.

edit: a word&&As an adult who avoids scary movies (because of the resulting nightmares), should I give this movie a try? &&Dude. Holy shit.&&Brace Yourselves.

Remakes of every single 80's horror movie are coming.&&one about a horribly frightening clown? *It* figures&&Glad to see an argentinian making it big in Hollywood! (Andy, the director, for those who don't know)&&I’m hoping the runaway success of It will inspire them to try a “do over” on the Dark Tower. That they’ll see it bombed because it deserved to bomb because it went so ridiculously far from the source material. 

Anyway, It deserves all its success. Great movie. Great adaptation. I was particularly impressed by the performances from all the child actors. &&The Goonies of the horror movie genre.&&Make that $500,000,08.50 as I’m finally getting to see it in 2 hours&&Why does everyone rush to the inflation comments? No they don’t adjust for inflation. It’s impossible to compare movies though on even ground. There are more movies than ever being put out. Every weekend there is at least one new wide release film. Movies in the past also didn’t have to compete with the variety of home entertainment options. Overall, movies today face much more competition between each other and other outside forces. 

So no, they don’t adjust for inflation. Let’s just celebrate the fact that It is having an amazing run that is deserved since it’s a great movie. &&A combination of great advertising, preexisting name recognition, and the movie not being bad&&The children in the movie really did an amazing job&&The cast of the kids really brought this movie to another level.&&No one would have even guessed such number was possible only a couple weeks before release. Amazing.&&Man I hope this starts a new wave of horror movies. Probably not, but I'd personally be thrilled if they decided to start churning out more horror films. &&Am I.... the only one who laughed for the majority of the film because of the witty insults and how ridiculous the clown looked?&&I've seen It three times in theaters already and I'm going again tomorrow night. It's got heart and humor while also being scary as hell. I totally understand why people love this film.&&""We'll make it PG so that we have a wider audience this way we'll triple our profits"" 

Movie proceeds to fail&&The AMC method&&I'm more sceptic about the source material. In the book the adult and kids section are intertwined. Here they seperated it. As has been pointed out, a huge portion of the success might be the 80s nostalgia appeal as well as the child actors. You will not have that in chapter 2, hence I believe the second part will not come even close to the success.&&Honestly, it needed a giant robot spider. &&COMING THIS SUMMER!

Rob Schneider always LOVED his BEST FRIENDS in his hometown!

But he didn't remember living in a house... WITH A CLOWN!

ROB SCHNEIDER and KEVIN JAMES in IT! RATED PG-13!&&Especially with the movies that premiered in the weeks leading up to it were pretty lackluster as well.&&If the dogshit previews for the horror movies being released soon are any indication, I totally agree with you.&&Yeah, at this point you know New Line is going to try to find a way to stretch this into a trilogy..&&And to think, Adam Sandler's ""Jack and Jill"" budget was 79million&&The budget was only $35mil?! That's insane, it was so well done. Goes to show that insanely large budgets (Avatar) don't make truly good movies. Can't wait to see what they'll do with part two. &&Yeah, it’s really impressive for a horror movie given horror movies usually have a smaller audience. I guess a combination of hype, the fact that it’s actually a pretty solid horror film, and the films that premiered in the weeks before it were meh helped a lot.&&But if you ask me, it's not really a traditional horror movie, which is what makes it such a great movie, and why it has been such a hit. Most horror movies are pretty...one note. There usually isn't a lot of depth. But *It* is a movie that is actually very heartfelt and touching, and it even has many moments of laugh-out-loud humor...two things that are almost non-existent in other horror movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely a horror fan, but *It* is in a different category than just horror. 

I actually hope that it gets some Oscar nods!&&Find out why doctors hate It!&&This is next level commenting. Thanks for teaching us all how it is done.&&Lmfao&&MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE 2: BAD MOTHERTRUCKERS&&I’m guessing it’ll be a mix: more high-quality, original horror films (like ‘Get Out’) and more sequels from reliable franchises (Conjuring, other Stephen King adaptations)&&I don’t think they’ll have to worry about their college funds. &&That Stranger Things kids got a VERY nice career ahead of them&&I would be happy with more lovecraftian monsters in cinema.&&More Stephen King. This may actually help get Josh Boone's film adaptation of *The Stand* off the ground.&&With this movie *and* STRANGER THINGS being big hits, I think it's likely we'll get more ""groups of kids in danger"" movies/shows, both in horror and other genres.&&Clown-nado&&Ironic, since IT and 80's small town horror/sci fi nostologia is a big reason Stranger Things exists &&Especially with all the clown sightings going on last year leading up to this year’s release. &&In before gone with the wind comment&&Not even close to ""The Exorcist."" http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/mpaa.htm?page=R&adjust_yr=2017&p=.htm &&genuinely curious, why dont they adjust for inflation?&&It's a little annoying, because this is always going to happen, and not adjusting for inflation is not a meaningful comparison.

Otherwise maybe we should say the highest grossing film was whatever sold in Zimbabwe shortly before they gave up on their currency. &&This comment was WAY too far down.  Adjusted for inflation the Exorcist made almost twice what ""It"" made.  There are some questions I have with the Exorcist numbers (it seems to include re-releases and also isn't clear if the box office of those re-releases is being inflation adjusted to the correct year (and not to the release year), but regardless it seems to have a very clear lead.

Nothing against ""It"" but I am a fan of not passing on such obviously deceptive statements in the name of hack ""journalism"".&&He's set for life already. Everything at this point is just gravy. &&He cares more about his stories being adapted well than how much he makes from them. &&Probably a fair amount beforehand given his reputation. Not sure in terms of royalties, but probably a couple million &&*Kingsman 

Yeah it confuses the fuck out of me every time aswell&&Big budget differences between the two though. &&Whether or not one likes the movie, I think we can all agree that this is only a good thing for the genre. More movies, more creativity, higher budgets.&&Ugh, ‘mother!’ was so much better.&&Should I watch it if I don't like horror movies?&&[deleted]&&Are we not allowed to criticise it?&&It was amazingly well written for an adaptation of a rather complex book. You get anxious for the characters because they get such good characterization that you really care about them. 

Plus the scary bits are delightfully unsettling. &&As a book fan, i was more then a little upset the bullies didnt do much, and a few other scenes got omitted[i assume those scenes will be in the flashbacks], but it was a VERY good adaptation. Anyone saying  its overrated is a liar &&Ugh, I'm sick of the so bad it's good movies. It's really ruining the horror genre in general. I went to see IT on opening weekend, and a group of teenagers were laughing hysterically  during some of the scary scenes. It ripped me out of the immersion and damped my enjoyment of the movie. This is all because the 'so bad its good' subgenre has really just seeped into the genre as a whole. A lot of people aren't taking horror seriously anymore, and it's sad. Horror is such a beautiful genre of film.&&I think not just horror, but for R rated films in general. Deadpool and Sausage Party really broke new ground for mainstream R rated films. If we get more risks like this, we may be gravy. &&Good analysis. I thought It was okay (good, but I'm surprised at just how crazy good it's doing) but I am so happy to see a return of mid-budget fare. Nowadays everything is by-the-numbers blockbusters, sequels or remakes, or basically independent films because their budget is so low. Even though this is a remake and an adaptation of a book, I do agree it bodes well for studios to again spend more money on these sort of mid-budget projects so we can get more diversity.&&Probably why it's doing so well.&&It's a ""Goonies"" genre flick. Which is a good thing I think. &&That fucking Georgie Scene at the beginning... The other fucking George scene in the cellar...

Bruh, this movie was scary as tits. It just also has some well-written and hilarious banter between the kids. Richie was amazing.&&Tim Curry was essentially that creepy guy on the bus dressed as a clown&&It’s like comparing Nicholson’s and Ledger’s Joker. Totally different styles that were good. 

But yeah Skarsgard was horrifying. I had a nightmare about him after the second time I watched it. No other horror movie has done that. Gonna watch it a third time for that reason.&&Tim Curry was an incredibly creepy clown. Skarsgard was an incredibly creepy thing acting like clown. &&The 2017 version is a much more accurate portrayal of Pennywise in the book; makes a joke here and there, but the humor is really a more twisted, sinister game It plays with the victims rather than a outright kooky jokes.

I'm really hoping that in the next one they develop Pennywise as a character a bit more; the stage has been set for it!&&Quoting another post I read on reddit, Tim Curry's pennywise was like a scary clown that could turn into scary stuff, while Skarsgard's pennywise feels like something horrific wearing a clown mask since the very start. I say the new one is much scarier.&&To be fair Tim Currys Pennywise was more human which made it more terrifying because you could see something like that happening in real life. The new it is more of a wreck that you can't look away from.  Not something you lose sleep over but more something you can't help but want to stare closer and closer at.&&I couldn't get past how attractive Bill Skarsgard is so I actually really enjoyed this portrayal of the clown despite how hideous It was. &&Why would those be fighting words?  Half of that statement is true.  Tim Curry is a better Pennywise.  He's the best thing in that mediocre miniseries.  He's the reason anyone remembers it fondly.

The 2017 version of It is much better, overall.  But, talking just about Pennywise, Tim Curry wins.&&A hundred developing nation sweatshops are cranking out Pennywise Halloween costumes as we speak.&&Nope, no way. The adult parts of the book is WAY shorter than the kids part, and most of it is them telling the kid's story through flashbacks. They would really struggle to split it into 2 parts.&&honestly, I wouldnt even be mad if they turned chapter 2 into 2 movies. There really is so much source material from the book.&&That looks incredible.&&I saw it confirmed that they at least considered having Pennywise turn into Freddy Kruger.

In the book, [they see a werewolf movie and It becomes a werewolf, which is alluded to in the house on Neiboldt Street.](#spoiler)&&It's just nostalgia. ""See! It's the 80s!""&&It’s got a creepiness about it, but it wasn’t downright terrifying.. at least to me. It’s woven with tons of heart and humor so the horror aspect is offset a bit. I 100% suggest seeing this; for me.. it’s one of the best films I’ve seen in the last few years.&&I wouldn't personally say this movie is too scary, but it really does depend on your scare factor - I think you should give it a try :D &&Yeah you definitely should. It's more of a coming-of-the-age movie than a horror movie.&&I am a person who hates horror movies and gets nightmares easily and I loved the movie. 

It's not super scary, but has a shit ton of jump scares which always get me. I definitely was creeped out and now have anxiety over red balloons. It honestly gave me a Stranger Things vibe more than anything. 



 🎈&&It's more creepy than scary&&As another adult who tends to avoid scary movies and went to go see it:

I saw it Saturday. It was *very* good. I don't regret going to see it.... but I've had nightmares every night and struggled with sleep. Lots of soothing tea and happy peppy counter measures. *Why no, the shower head dripping is definitely not Pennywise drooling.... definitely not...*. Each night is getting easier. My husband, friends, and I had fun. Go see it when the sun will still be up and do something light hearted afterwards. Definitely not the circus though.&&I'd say yes. I am a massive horror fan, and I didn't find It to be particularly scary. It was more of a cool movie about kids going up against a monster. If you watched (and liked) Stranger Things, this is right up your alley. Some jump scares, but not too bad. A really well made movie.&&Can’t spell shit without ‘It’!&&Pennywise made a pretty penny &&Argentinians are known for their horror prowess. &&He's a bit of a Del Toro protégé as well, isn't he?&&Wasnt too scary but it is a really good movie.&&Is this ""heart and humor"" an inside joke from the movie or something? At least ten people have posted that exact comment.&&And than, ""why didn't anyone watch it??""&&You joke, but this is exactly what happened with Conan the Barbarian. First movie? R rated, huge success. Sequel? Let's make that PG. One of the worst sequels of all time&&The AMC method?
&&I hear the kids are back but in flash back form. &&But if the adult actors are just as good, it won't really matter and part 2 will be great. Hopefully.&&the director has said the sequel will have flashbacks with the kids&&Right. I don't know how intentional that was but it certainly worked to their advantage. I'm sure they did look at exactly what was coming out in the weeks before and after, but maybe they couldn't have anticipated exactly how bad those last few weeks before would be. &&They just kind of publicly dragged their dong across ""The Dark Tower""s forehead. &&To be fair you would have difficulty not timing it around a movie release that was a let down&&This October....PG-13....will.....make....you.....SHIT....your....PANTS.

A KidzBop Pictures Int'l feature film. &&Happy Death Day looks perfect in that campy sort of way. Perfect outdated song and everything.&&Flatliners actually looks pretty interesting tbh. Other than that I would have to agree.&&There were some who told me that 2 movies is still not enough to cover the entire book?&&Inb4 IT Cinematic Universe&&it comes every 27 years. they could go back in time or into the future if they change the ending of the next movie&&Let's also be honest.

It was based on a property a lot of people already liked/had good feelings about. I know people hate reboots/remakes/reimaginings, but if this hadn't been King's It, but the same quality, it would have been successful, but we'll never know if it would have been this.&&Not just a solid horror film but it's a solid movie by any measure. Didn't have any cheesy horror acting, and all the main characters made relatable decisions. In most horror films you have this feeling of ""why don't the people in this movie just..?"" But in this movie there's no way to escape Pennywise, you feel just as mentally unprepared as these kids are.&&I would tend to agree. Horror is my favourite genre, but It felt much more coming-of-age/adventure than straight-up horror. I only jumped once.&&[deleted]&&Well to be fair, if anything needs a solid revisiting, it's Maximum Overdrive.

Fuck, why is this the third time I find myself talking about that movie in the past couple days?&&This is giving Hollywood too much credit, we're probably just going to get more movies with clowns in them.&&Imagine Netflix or preferably, HBO making The Stand into a 10 part miniseries. &&Thankfully the last couple years have been seeing some seriously good horror flicks hitting the market and it's been very, very refreshing to see.&&As someone who hates reading, I'd love more Stephen King adaptations / remakes.  
Wouldn't mind some Dean R. Koontz either.&&There was something in the Hollywood Reporter today about how they only got paid $65-$75k each. That's not even half a college fund.

I suspect 2 or 3 of them will get nice pay bumps for the second one.&&Seriously. He's like a tiny, white and Canadian Samuel L. Jackson.&&All of the Stranger Things kids need protected at all costs. 

But holy shit Finn Wolfhard has a damn exciting career ahead of him now. He’s a major name in two major successful movie/tvshows. &&The kid that plays Eddie is in a new show on CBS with Bobby Moynihan. &&Only if they can properly pull off the whole Lovecraftian horror thing. &&Lovecraftian and cinema don't really *work* together.

Stranger Things is basically just a re-telling of It. Seriously, look at the story, it's almost exactly the same. I love both though.&&That scene where Rhett bit Scarlett's arm off was pure kino&&Frankly my dear, you'll float too&&Genuine question. Did the exorcist make all that money during its original run? Because I read a comment in another thread that it was rereleased and that added to how much it made.&&Yeah, adjusted, Exorcist is like [#9 all time domestic](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm). Like more than any of the Indiana Jones movies. Which is crazy to me.

But I'm assuming it went beyond just a 'horror' audience and became a must-see cultural event, predicated a lot on it's shock value for the time.&&Holy shit.  Beverly Hills Cop is in third place, just behind #1 The Exorcist and #2 The Godfather for a gross of over 500 million.  Who knew?&&If you adjust for inflation most contemporary films would never beat the totals for the highest-grossing older films so you'd hardly ever have records broken. Films breaking records every few years is good PR, it suggests continual growth in the the industry.

And it's not technically wrong to label newer films as highest-grossing, in terms of absolute dollars. The gross numbers for ""It"" are higher than the Exorcist, those dollars just aren't worth as much now as they were then. &&He is set, that's for sure, but damn if his movie adaptations aren't EXTREMELY hit and miss. For every one great adapation, there's about two okay adaptations and three terrible adaptations..&&I believe King’s estimated net worth is around $400 million. He didn’t really need this movie to be a success, but it’s certainly nice. He deserves what he gets.&&And cocaine.&&At this point its just easier to list the movies that Aren't Stephen King adaptations.&&Helps when you make residuals of Stand By Me, Shawshank and Green Mile, movies that are on every weekend&&> He cares more about his stories being adapted than how well they're being made
&&You missed more remakes. &&Same year as Get Out too. Great year for horror&&Hell yeah!&&To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand mother! The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theological history most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Aronofsky's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike mother! truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in J. Law's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Aronofsky's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a mother! tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.&&Read that in Napoleon Dynamite's voice.&&A regular at my work saw that movie.

Once the credits started to roll an older woman in the audience just yelled out “did anyone else know what the hell was going on?”&&I'm a huge wuss with horror, I'm too scared to see most of it in theaters. I would not call myself a horror fan at all. And I found it not scary at all. It's creepy more than scary. The jump scares are very minimal, and they aren't the kind that made me feel like shit, they felt well done. 

&&It depends what kind of horror you don’t like. The movie isn’t a psychological horror nor a body horror but a bit of both, and very dumbed down in both cases. I’d describe it as a very creepy fantasy adventure movie, with some parts that might make you jump if you’re not anticipating them. I’m not a big fan of horror films myself because most of them focus on the horror itself, rather than the actual plot/characters. But IT does a really great job of balancing everything. At times I forgot I was watching a horror film because the not-scary scenes were just as interesting. So yes, I recommend it highly, even if you don’t like horror movies. It’s a very well-made film.&&Absolutely. Its closer to the Goonies than it is to most modern horror flicks, and the characters really capture your inner child.&&Just don't see it.  The main focus of the movie wasn't Pennywise, but how much they can have a bunch of 11 year-olds swear in 135 minutes.  I'm a bitch when it comes to horror movies, and I was only scared for about 2 minutes total throughout the entire movie.  

I was really disappointed because I had been looking forward to it since the first trailer and bugged my friends about seeing it for 2 weeks after it came out until they would finally go with me.

There was absolutely no build-up for the scares.  There wasn't the constant air of ""Pennywise is about to eat these kids at any moment,"" rather ""Watch this pre-teen make more jokes about his friends' moms' vaginas -- oh, and here's a clown.""

I have absolutely no idea why this movie is as successful as it is.&&its like a short season of stranger things, my girl doesnt like horror movies but she loved it. great cast, great film&&Do it, i hate horror movies and i was shitting myself with some scenes, but it was worth it, plus the humor softens the pain a bit &&We all float our boats down here Georgie && (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞&&You'll float too.&&Just give it a couple months until the hive mind swings the other way&&So long as they are warranted.&&I just wish we could've seen some of the crazy side of Patrick Hockstetter besides the fire and lighter, he was beyond creepy in the book&&Apparently the kid actors will be returning for the second movie, so there will definitely be flashback sequences. The one scene I'm really looking forward to and hope that they do in the new one is (sorry I don't remember his name) but the gay kid who was pushed into the river. I mean they'll obviously have to do something to show Pennywises return, but I hope they don't pull any punches on the homophobia, it's what really displayed Derry as just an evil town&&I don't know if I'd say it was a good adaptation. The key theme (the power of belief, childhood vs adulthood, etc.) is completely absent. The magic of childhood is completely ignored until the very end where it comes out of nowhere; we trip over ourselves in the final act and, instead of our heroes resolving to go stop It, they are forced to Rescue the Princess.

One change I did like is that instead of the pharmacist being the one to tell Eddie about the placebos, someone else does it (it doesn't make sense that it is someone who doesn't like him, but whatever.) Making it so the pharmacist is just as oblivious/uncaring as the rest of the adults helped stay on theme.

I liked it, as a story unto itself. But, as an adaptation, I'm not sure, and probably won't be until I've had a lot more time to think about it. &&People don't take horror seriously because it's been a long time since we've actually had ""scary"" horror. I'm a big fan of the extreme, torture-porn type horror (like the Hostel series and would you rather), but those are few and far between. The stuff that comes out of Hollywood that legitimately tries to scary is almost always laughable. So the best I hope for out of Hollywood horror is something that gives me as much gore as it can and makes me laugh (since it will never scare me).&&I think Logan also definitely helped. It was less of a risk because Wolverine was already a huge seller, no matter what. But I definitely think it's part of the wave of recent R-Rated films that have made studios go ""you know what? Maybe this isn't such a bad idea after all....""&&It's funny that it's those two movies.  Both of them are ""making fun of"" the PG movies.  Taking all the common tropes of a typical Pixar/Hero movie and making it R rated.&&I'm partial to the theory that Pennywise is just how Tim Curry naturally looked, and every other time you've seen him it's with tons of makeup.&&Wow so that guys co-worker was right then&&""Oh, am I not real enough for you Billy? I was real enough for Georgie"". Both over the top insane and also chilling.&&That smile he does looks even creepier without the makeup!&&Agreed. Skarsgard's Pennywise was more like an animal with a sick sense of humor than an actual human. Completely unpredictable and vicious &&Agreed.

There's a section of the book where he literally explains how fear makes the kids taste better. He's not really looking for humor.&&Tim Curry is great in everything, but he's not a scary Pennywise. Skarsgard is a terrifying Pennywise that hits many of the same points Curry did, but is frightening instead of jokey. He specifically said Curry was more frightening, not specifically that he was ""better"".&&The miniseries was on tv right when I got home from seeing the new it.  I watched it.  Tim Curry did fine, but his voice bounces between New Jersey teamster and angry Jewish mother.  Tim curry played a creepy clown with a mean smokers voice, Skarsgard  played an inter dimensional creature that fed off of fear. Pennywise is the latter, so giving the win to Curry on this one seems weird to me.&&I never saw Curry as Pennywise he wasn't scary at all. 

2017 IT even when it was ""being funny"" it was unsettling. &&Think of it this way. Let's say It 2017 was the one that came out in 1990, and the 1990 one was the one that came out today. Would we be saying the same thing?

I think if the 2017 version came out 27 years ago we'd all be heralding it as the greatest horror film of all time.&&That's the book, though. They'll have to take artistic liberty in making the second part if they want it to be a good horror movie. I suspect they'll just make up a new story while maintaining the same general idea of adults coming back to beat It.&&That would have been amazing. &&He started to become a werewolf in the new movie too&&He turned into a mummy in the final fight as well.&&The book was nostalgia too. ""See! It's the 50s!""&&Its alot of fun and scary at the same time. specially when you're with friends watching. That projector scene was scary af but we laughed so hard after they got out of the garage.&&Good to know! I'll give it a try!&&[deleted]&&Poop&&Sh.&&Any good Argentinian horror movie?&&loved mama. what else should i watch?&&Somewhat. His shot film for *Mama* attracted Del Toro to but for the film itself, Muschetti was pretty much given free reign to do what he wanted. Strange, considering how much it seems like one of the former's.&&Think piece about millennials killing the film industry&&""Why didn't anyone watch it 2??""

FTFY&&You forget. They'll know why: ""Rotten Tomatoes killed the buzz!""&&Then*&&They're referring to the way AMC treated The Walking Dead after the first season.&&I hear they are putting the kids playing the adult parts with fake mustaches on.&&Let's wait for the giant spider.&&[IT](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=it.htm) is a domestic hit relatively speaking. 

At 55% domestic the split is heavily home based compared to say blockbusters. While the USA is still (for a little bit) the world's largest market it isn't that hard to top it collectively. Compare to [Spidey](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman2017.htm) or [Despicable 3](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=despicableme3.htm) for something more typical or even [Beauty and the Beast](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beautyandthebeast2017.htm) which is still #1 on both domestic and worldwide lists. 

Of course with an almost nothing budget IT is runaway success even on international money alone it is paid for albeit only as a 'modest' hit. Also joins Wonder Woman and Get Out as further evidence American tastes in movies are changing in my book. Though I wouldn't be suprised the rest of the world follows suit later being just less saturated and worn out then we are.&&Wait that came out? Well then &&I wanted to like that movie so bad, but it was sooo bad.&&I am tired of PG 13 movies, horror in particular. I hope that after the success of It the studios take the muzzles off their directors and give us some good R horror. They've done too much PG-13. &&THIS SLOW-PACED ARTISTIC BIBLICAL ALLEGORY WILL MAKE YOU **LOSE YOUR MIND**&&Obviously the basic idea has been done before (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Supernatural, etc.) but I don’t recall it being applied to an actual horror film. It definitely looks more fun and like it takes itself less seriously than something like The Snowman. I’m actually looking forward to Happy Death Day because it *could* work in a way similar to You’re Next.&&My friends scoffed at that trailer, but I thought it looked like a fun movie.

Like, it's obviously not a blockbuster, but I like the idea.&&As a remake they have every chance to make it great or fuck it up.&&Well it isn’t really but then again Lord of the Rings was supposed to be near enough impossible to put into film format and they did a damn good job of that. As long as they keep the essence of the original story I’ll be happy and the first film managed to really capture the feeling of the kids sections in the book. &&The book is *full* of of side stories and character details etc. Most of it is not suitable for a movie. Bare bones plot wise theres not that much so all they have to do is stay true to the characters as best they can and put it some fan favourite, notable moments. Basically what they did in part 1. &&It could be done in two, there are a lot of extra anecdotes that just root the reader in the history of the the town of Derry, but focusing on the main cast of characters as children and adults could guarantee a seamless transition into two films and leave viewers satisfied. But It really is a damn good book, that deserves complete unearthing.
&&Release a direct to video prequel fleshing out Pennywise and Derry's history when the second movie hits.  

Big bucks. &&If you wanna get technical, It is part of the Dark Tower universe, so the foundation has already been laid!&&King's It  was one of the biggest books of the 80s.  It was a huge seller when King was at his peak.&&It has remained successful mostly because of Tim Curry's performance in the tv movies tbh.&&You're right, I think the clout the story already had because of Stephen King definitely helped to build up the hype over it, but I can honestly say that for me it was one instance where it totally lived up to the hype, and it's actually better in every way than the Tim Curry version. Like, there's no comparison. After I saw it, I went and watched the 1990 version and couldn't even finish it...I hadn't seen it in years and it was just so hokey and stupid...and I almost never think that about remakes. So I think it just might have stood on its own had it not been associated with Stephen King. &&Only thing I can say is there were several times I would shake my head when they would split up. However they are kids so I can't really blame them for making dumb choices. &&Uhhh there were a lot of times I was thinking ""Well now I know why It goes after kids. They have a terrible flight reflex."" Also maybe because Pennywise is equally annoyed by their dropping their fucking bikes in a pile in the middle of the street all the time.&&> Not just a solid horror film but it's a solid movie by any measure. 

I would actually say that while it's a great coming-of-age movie,  as a horror movie it leaves a lot to be desired.

But then, I can't stand horror movies that rely on jump scares and music cues.&&Yeah it was reminiscent of *Stand By Me* in a lot of ways.&&[deleted]&&That means they captured the essence of King’s story pretty well. Most of his books are, in fact, coming of age stories at their core. &&Horror doesn't mean you have to jump. I loved the book and it absolutely falls within the horror genre, in a refreshing way.&&The coming-of-age was done much better than its horror story.&&Just FYI, jump scares are more of a horror tactic (and usually a pretty cheap one) rather than the definition of the genre. A lot of horror plays on unresolved tension, psychology, or the grotesque. The coming of age aspects of King's stories help to connect you to the characters, and I think that strengthens the horror elements. ""It"" the novel is probably my favorite example: it's touching, it's funny, it makes the characters feels alive, and it is *utterly horrifying.*&&Bet it was the bathroom scene with Bev&&Krusty the klown origin story&&Prepare yourself for a ""killer klowns from outer space "" remake &&So business as usual then?&&HBO-made miniseries would be incredible.&&And good sci-fi too.  Ex machina was amazing, and I really liked under the skin.  And now in feburary an adaptation of ""annihilation"", one of my favorite sci-fi/creepy books from the last few years.  Oh, and fingers crossed for bladerunner sequel, seems to be getting good advance reviews.  Although ridley Scott can eat a dick for what he did with alien.&&Why do you hate reading?&&That's not half a college fund depending on where you live and where you go to college. $70k would pay for my degree about two and a half times over.&&The second one is gonna be about the adult versions though. Bad news, kids.&&In what world do you live in where 0 colleges cost less than 75k for a degree. &&Well, the IT book tells the story of the adults and children sides of the characters at the same time, so I expect the second movie to be about the adults, so I doubt the kids will be in it too much.&&Well that one kid is from Canada so that is more than enough for a college fund.&&I am sick and tired of these motherfucking clowns in this motherfucking well.&&Not that tiny...

I haven't seen mother!, does the film make comments on global warming or something?&&You do a reaaaally good job of impersonating an iamverysmart guy. &&Same, I can't handle horror films. But IT only had a couple of, ""Oh, shit,"" moments and not a prolonged aura of creepiness.&&Ehhhh I wouldn't say the jump scares are minimal, there's a fair share, but they tend to leave you laughing rather than being freaked out&&Honestly, the banter between the kids was the real highlight of this movie.&&It really was basically a horror themed Goonies, but more like Supernatural in terms general scariness.&&You can criticize it now. I can argue that the movie doesnt really know what it wants to be as it jumps all over the place as a horror, an adventure, action packed, a comedy, and an 80s homage. However you just have to recognize that its unique for breaking the financial records it did for the genre it is. From a financial point and from the majority of people who've seen it(including reddit) really enjoyed it.&&I liked it. Nonetheless the ending was kinda ""meh"". Additionally I think a lot of the early scare scenes would have been WAY fucking scarier if the film wasn't blasting us with loud noise for no reason.

The moderately loud warbling sound when looking at pennywise was great, but whenever a creepy/scary thing was on the screen we didn't get to enjoy it for one moment because the movie was just going NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOISE YOU SHOULD BE SCARED NOW NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOISE.

This is more of a critique of modern horror (old films did it too sometimes).

Also some of the characters appear to have had cut scenes, their stories were very sudden, shallow and sometimes completely unexpected for no real reason.&&Yes that was my biggest disappointment. No fridge, no baby brother. 
&&I'm not sure you could do much better without alienating an audience when it comes to sing in all the magical aspects of their friendship. I mean, he was already only working with a $35M budget and approx. a 2 hour runtime. You could easily make a 3-3.5 hour movie by adding in the silver bearings, the expanded apocalyptic rock fight, more about Henry and his guys and, of course, the Turtle. 

I think Muschietti added in as much as he possibly could without the movie becoming alienating only to people familiar with the book and staying within bounds of the studio's wants. 

I'm expecting that Muschietti expands more on the magic of childhood stuff in Chapter 2 in order to resolve how the kids adult counterparts are able to kill Pennywise as adults. &&His inflections were awesome. ""Go ahead... take i... tuh."" &&That was such a great scene. &&A lot of people don't get why he was so in-your-face. He's an interdemensional demon who doesn't understand human mannerisms or emotions. So he's going to exaggerate an already exaggerated parody of humor to an intense, inhuman degree. Skarsgard nailed it.&&If you read the book, Pennywise in clown form was never scary. Just unnerving and a creepy guy.&&I enjoyed curry's take more, and that might be simply because I liked how curry's persona melded with pennywise more than scar's guard's. 

The new clown also had wayyyy more production value than curry's so I don't think it's entirely fair to compare the two either. &&Curry played Pennywise how he was described in the book.  I'm re-reading the book right now and it just reminds me how far they strayed from how he was described.  My problem with the new version is he seems creepy from the get-go.  Pennywise was supposed to look like a regular clown you'd see at a circus and not seem ""off"" until after you started to look closer.

I don't dislike the new version of Pennywise, but I prefer Curry's take, mostly because it is closer to how I pictured him from reading the book.&&They pay a quick little homage to it when they are in the basement and Eddy is about to get it.  You see the hand begin to transform into the werewolf, he just doesn't take that form in the rest of the scene.

I love all the tiny details they tossed into this movie for fans of the book.  Yeah, the plot has some major differences, but they tied it to the book fairly well through the characters and small things. (The other kids going missing that are just mentioned, etc)&&Reboot movie, round 2.  Hire current popular director. Fire over petty argument when movie is 80% complete.  Abandon project.&&Ha. I see what you did there!&&I'd totally watch that&&Then CGI the mustaches off a la Justice League&&The difference between It and the movies you listed, is It is rated R, which makes the box office even more impressive. Horror, especially R horror, in general has been treated like such a niche market, and here we have one that's already in the top 5 movies of the year domestically and that's after 3 weeks of release. &&It was a ghost shit.  They pooped it out, and it sank past the bowl without even a flush. &&On the plus side, it was confirmed that it will have literally nothing to do with the Dark Tower TV show afaik&&I'd guess most horror movies are PG13 because teens are the biggest genre to see them. When I saw IT, it was 75% teenagers in my theater. I saw LOTR and a few other non-horror films at the same theater and never noticed so many teens.&&Light's out was PG-13, and I thought it was awesome!&&Movie looked fun, but I wasn't a fan of the trailer. I feel like it showed sooooo much more than what was needed, slightly turned me off of the film. So I can understand their distaste&&it's such a random remake. it'd be like a remake of White Noise or The Lazarus Project&&So are you saying we get an underage orgy?&&They should do Animatrix style shorts of those side stories in lead up for the release of part 2.&&I wish they'd put more of the side stories in there. At least the bit about Dorsey and Eddie Cocoran that actually wakes It up for the cycle.&&I saw someone suggest (don't remember who to give credit) they do the scenes from Derry history as sort of a horror anthology movie, with different directors taking on the Spot fire, or the ironworks explosion, etc.

If done right that could be an excellent movie, and part of a trilogy without being directly tied in to the story of the Losers Club. Seeing different iterations of Pennywise throughout time? Yes plz. 

Edit:not to mention it provides room for a pennywise origin story that can explain deadlights, Maturin, todash, etc. I want this to happen so bad. &&In VCR &&I would absolutely welcome a Dark Tower film franchise from New Line, if they can get the rights from Sony. 

Because fuck Sony.&&King hasn't even begun to peak.&&Yep your right. ""It was one of the biggest books of the 80's.""         
It was also one of the best seller/s.&&Watched it a couple days back. Curry is great, and so are the kids, actually. It's the adults that kind of stink it up with soap opera acting. &&I think even at the time people said the 1990 version was bad/mediocre with the exception of a really good performance by Tim Curry carrying everything else. &&Some movies don't age well, and are better for the nostalgia. TV movies, especially, haven't aged well.&&>let's stay together 

>proceeds to enter rooms at different times so the door locks them out&&The only other thing that bothered me that I can think of was Bev sticking her face right over the drain when she heard the voices.  I feel like most 13ish-year-olds would have ran right the fuck out of that room.&&It's not because they're kids, it's because IT is using supernatural powers to affect their decision-making.

It's kinda IT's thing.&&Except they never split up. Pennywise had an attraction that they really couldn't control. That's how I viewed the film at least &&For some reason that bugged the hell out of me.
In the book Billy's ""Silver"" Schwinn had a much larger story behind it and I just couldn't see him dumping it in the middle of the road like that.&&That and kids are easy to scare.

[HMMMM](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=142_taikqaw)&&I jumped when Bev kills her dad, turns around and there’s Pennywise. Everything leading up to that scene is a giant crescendo, and I was so focused on if she’d get away from her father, that after she killed him I thought she was safe. Barely a heartbeat goes by and she’s in ITs clutches.&&Yeah, I was really not at all scared when I saw it. And I'm not one of those people who tries to be badass by taking pride in not getting scared by horror movies, I just honestly don't think it did a good job in the ""freak people out"" category. It showed too much - your imagination is always scarier than some CGI toothy thing. But the characters, relationships, humor, etc, was really great.&&Send in the Klowns 2018

They botched the Dark Tower and King mostly licenses his material to networks who don't give a shit.&&I haven't seen any of the early reviews cropping up for Blade Runner yet but I've seen a few mentions of that now and I'm really happy to see that. The first one is one of my favorite movies ever and I've rarely been so hyped for a movie as I am for that one. What's more worth the hype too for me is they're bringing the original back in theaters for at least one day next week leading up to the new one.&&That movie fucked me up for weeks! But my boyfriend was unfazed and didn't love it. Idk maybe you have to be a little more disassociated to fully recognize the horror of it. Anyway I loved it!&&Reading is like anal sex, if you're forced into it at elementary school, you'll dislike it as an adult.  
In all seriousness though, I am easily distracted, and also get headaches when I need to focus on reading (causal reading, like on reddit, don't give me this problem).

Rather, I see (and hope!  desperately hope!) for things more along the lines of *ET.*  *Midnight Special* actually stands out in my head as an example of the direction.&&Given the differences in ratings systems and cultural standard globally I'm tempted to consider that a rather different issue.

Day in the life of Patrick Hockstetter and things.&&Yesssss please!!!&&I continue to stand behind the idea for a viral marketing push where a young man Mike Hanlon should be casted to do some 'documentaries' on Derry's history, like he writes in his journal in the book. 

Like I said, you cast a young unknown actor to play 20-30 year old Mike for 3 or 4 docs covering The Bradley Gang, the Kitchener Ironworks explosion, the fire that killed Mike's parents (in the movie, in the book it was a nightclub fire), the original town settlers that all disappeared and one that leads directly into Chapter 2 that shows how Mike (whoever they cast as the actual adult Mike now) has been keeping tabs on his friends after they've left Derry. How he's struggled in his decision to call them back and to make sure that all the new murders in Derry are actually because of It. 

With that idea, you could appease fans of the book by making the Derry Interludes from the book and help fans of the movie by filling them in on the larger mythology of Pennywise and his role in shaping Derry, that the movie only briefly touches on. 

EDIT - Words&&I liked the fictional town history of Derry in the book. I would have liked to see more about the black spot or iron works &&I get it but really what else could they do with a 2 hour movie?&&What? Georgie was the opening sacrifice in the '50s cycle. Dorsey was murdered by his stepfather and Eddie is killed well into the cycle by the Creature from the Black Lagoon, resulting in Mike finding his knife in the park and his second run-in with It.&&That would be fucking awesome. If they need to pad it out into a trilogy i would fully support this method. &&That is pretty close to the Castle Rock show that is supposed to be coming out soon, an anthology-ish series about almost all of King's 80s novels. &&I wouldn't. Dark Tower should be a TV series. &&He's back on cocaine?&&When king peaks we will know it.&&About a year ago I decided to watch some classics like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th.

The conclusion I reached was that acting in horror was atrocious in the 80s and 90s. Just so bad.&&That's true.&&Absolutely. IT and Langoliers are two of my favorite hokey tv movies growing up thanks to my mom being a huge stephen king fan. A Remake for both of those can only be better and IT proved that. Maybe if they were both actual movies with bigger budgets and actors back then we may be thinking differently, but a TV mini-series that is just a small one off thing can only go up for the most part, especially those being as old as they are. TV movies do NOT hold up well over time no matter what the subject matter is.
&&To be fair to them, Eddie was sure taking his time as the rear guard, staring at the door behind them; it's not like being that spread out was the intention. Plus, when you're thirteen and in the 80s, you probably haven't heard ""stay close, check your corners"".  I can forgive tactical blunders when it's children looking for an Eldritch evil. &&Haha yes that was so infuriating &&I also liked how overly gory that scene was. I watched the old one before I saw the new one and it was so overboard I loved it. &&Well this is partly because Pennywise puts his victims into a bit of a trance in order to lure them&&Idk, I don't think many people would expect anything to be able to come out of a small hole like that. I think she probably thought the sound came from wayyy below and she got closer to have a better look. I think her reaction for someone who doesn't know she is starring in a horror film was natural.&&Not when your father, Rapey McFuckface, is getting boozed up on Schlitz in the next room.&&[deleted]&&I wish more people would understand this. A good example is near the end when Stan gets seperated from the group in the sewers, Pennywise completely changes the room he's in without him realizing. He didn't wander off or anything, in fact he thought the others ran off on him. &&wait, what's the deal with that bike? sorry, haven't read the book, but I did notice they kept focusing on it. I assumed it was just a relatability thing&&""How the fuck am I meant to turn into Negative Equity with a High Interest Mortgage?""&&Gone Girl was totally an adult horror movie.&&King is a rock star because his writing is so easy to follow.  I can burn through 200 pages of King before I can get 20 pages of Bret Easton Ellis.

The author *puts you there* effortlessly.  You don't have to work to get into some King.  90% of his books are, ""Start reading, can't stop.""  The rest may not float your boat.  He's my go-to author for... well, *any* reading.  Just want to lay down and get in another world?  King all day.

For contrast try some Peter Watts.  *Blindsight* is all kinds of jacked up.  I blew through that book 3 times until I really started digging into the depths.  *But I didn't have to dig*.  It was as easy or as hard as I wanted.  &&Causal reading is such an interesting and unexplored segment of quantum literature&&Try an audiobook where you're busy doing other things.

The vast majority are in the South, and so the cost of housing would be measurably less than elsewhere, so yes, there are plenty of schools where 75k would equal a 4 year collegiate education and then some. &&I hope they already filmed the flashbacks, or there may be problems&&Check out In The Mouth of Madness if you haven't already.

Ofcourse as an adult and a horror fan, watching it now it isn't scary at all.

Yes! You're right.  Edited.

>And Midnight Special underperformed at the box office pretty badly. I don't think that's the lesson studios will take from this film.

Yeah, we'll see.&&I just watched Midnight Special a few weeks ago. While I loved most aspects of the movie, it got a little too high concept for me at the end. It needed more subtlety. (Honestly, so did IT, though I enjoyed IT more.)&&Conspiracy: all the clown fervor the past few years is just viral marketing for IT, because they knew it was going to happen 27 years from the first one&&Train surely.&&It’s even more infuriating that people don’t seem to understand that. &&Oh son of a bitch, I'm a fucking idiot.&&That scene hits hard. I felt really bad for Beverly because not ONLY was she trapped with her sexually abusive father, but she also got the worst of it from Pennywise/IT. Covering her and the whole bathroom with blood, then kidnapping her to the sewer and using the super mouth-open paralyzing move. She went through some serious shit.&&IIRC isn't Silver meant to have cards in the spokes?&&I kind of do miss shit, but I take it in stride.  Just try to understand what's going on in a really stream of conscious way.   If things really don't make sense rewind 30 secs. I had a lot of difficulty at first (I got the ADD) but it gets easier to get into it as you get used to the medium.  I've read like 20 books through audible and I can't recommend it enough.  Also, all of Kings books have pretty solid narrators. &&Uhh 16 year olds look and sound way different than 13 year olds&&Ah that makes sense, I probably first saw it like 10 years ago.  I guess a lot of the devices it utilized have probably been copied over the years and diluted the impact.&&M'arms are broken!&&Truly&&That and the fact they wanted the it remake and when they didn't get it they went and did stranger things&&King's books and Spielberg's style. Winning combo.&&i would love to see if a director xould actually pull these off.  would be wonderful to see&&and then with Lovecraft popularity maybe people will go digging through Lovecraftian movies and the [extremely unsettling Prince of Darkness 80's found footage dream sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGsv0pJemTY) can be reevaluated. then all of John Carpenter's Apocalypse trilogy can be widely loved and not just The Thing&&Del Toro's script for Mountains of Madness was damn disappointing unfortunately. Lovecraft is all about that creeping insanity and slow burn cosmic horror. Del Toro turned it into a giant CGI schlock fest, which hurts to say because I've been a huge fan a huge fan of his even since the Cronos days. &&They're turning the frickin frogs into clowns!&&Additional thought: Given that Japan has the Olympics for 2020, perhaps there is an Akira tie-in.&&I completely believe this&&Relevant username&&I'll also like to point out that it was both blood and hair, both which represent female puberty.&&All of the things Pennywise made them see were supposed to be related to their fears and all the bad things happening in their lives.&&Because she was the strongest of them&&I have to point out that he's not sexually abusive (yet) and never really gets the chance to be. He's physically abusive, yes, but in the book it's specifically pointed out that prior to the point where he wants to check her hymen he's never crossed that line, and it's further pointed out that It is using him at that point.

Not to make excuses for the guy, he WAS abusive. Just not that way.&&Yeah that was pretty lame. They made her such a victim. In the book she's such a boss with her slingshot =( &&Spot on. The exorcist defined the paranormal horror genre. That means that movies after it have gone on to reproduce the same elements but done it much better so now it just comes off as lame or boring. &&M'every thread&&I'm happier with it this way honestly, *It* was masterfully done and Stranger Things has been masterfully done in its own, different way. IMO the best of both worlds, the Duffers deserved a multi-season run to develop their world. *It* would have been too packed if they'd done it, I reckon.&&a suspenseful, moody adaptation of *Innsmouth* could be great. No jump scares, just a constant foreboding and build up of suspense as the protagonist unravels what's going on in the town.&&Guillermo del Toro has been waiting decades for this.&&Great. Now I have to worry about gay frog clowns? Or is it frog gay clowns? &&....oh son of a bitch&&Yeah that was something I wasn't 100% on watching. It definitely hinted on sexual abuse but it wasn't definitive&&Oh is that so? I will admit I have not yet read the book. The implication I got was that her father had a history of sexual abuse. When he asked if she was still his little girl, I took it to mean that he was being possessive of her, not that he was looking to preserve her innocence/make sure she was still a virgin for anything.

That's my mistake. I honestly thought that he was a full on sexual abuser and that they just implied it in the movie so it wasn't too heavy &&It seemed pretty implied that she was being sexually abused in the movie. &&M'jolly rancher&&",2017-09-28 17:01:17

The cabbie immediately recognized the brilliance and uniqueness of the sketches.  He then set about tracking down the man who left it.

Eventually he found Guillermo and gave him the book back.  Guillermo had spent years working on those sketches, and had given up on ever recovering them.

Can probably stream it easily with a google search or two. It's definitely a reversal of the trope, but for different effect. It's great at forcing the viewer to feel dissonant emotions.&&[deleted]&&What are you talking about? That fish guy is sexy as fuck&&At least in this movie the female protagonist is not a flawless traditional beauty like Jennifer Lawrence or Emma Watson.  If you look up the actress, Sally Hawkins, you'll see that while she's lovely in her own way, she's not your typical leading lady.

Edit: Wow, there are a lot of dudes here eager to assert that Jennifer Lawrence is nothing special.&&Spring (2014) is kind of like that. A dude from America goes to Italy and falls in love with a woman whose true form is some kind of fucked up lovecraftian monstrocity. The movie is basically romantic drama/comedy with horror/thriller elements&&Problem with the trope in the first place is that although saying the man is a beast isn't wrong, they still make the beast sexy by playing down the negative and scary aspects of his differences, and really pushing the masculinity of said character. Give him a human enough face and a big build/masculine physique and all of a sudden you've got a misunderstood hunk with a soft side who really cares - and you notice you don't have a beast at all, you've got a lot of girls' ideal man. I say this having had a huge crush on beast growing up.

It's an extremely safe trope, and any social commentary it tries to make is lost on the fact that you're cheering for the beast in the first place and there's little to no internal conflict for the viewer. You can derive some social commentary from it if you stop to think about it and come up with a moral to the story, but it's quite contrived.

In order to get anything out of this trope, I honestly think there needs to be a real change of perspective. For example, seeing the whole thing from the perspective of the townsfolk who are terrified of the beast and really think it's done terrible things, and trying to generate the same fear in the viewer, then having him actually be hideous but still somehow show that he's not the real monster in the end.

I think it's a lot harder to find 'sexy' things about beastliness for a woman, so maybe that would be more conducive for a fresh take on the trope, but honestly I don't think people would like that. I'd be fascinated by such a movie, really, but I'm not sure I'd even enjoy it. It'd be the sort of thing I'd be able to appreciate by stepping back and looking at the whole thing, but I honestly think it'd take a genius director to make that story appeal to people and not lose its focus. People like beauty - be it conventional or unconventional - and classic storylines. The trope exists in its state for a reason.

Now I do want to say that the best exception to this I know of is Notre Dame de Paris (Not the disney version!), but holy shit is it heavy. It's an incredible story with a lot of meaning, but it's no fairy tale: [Quasimodo is beaten and tortured for things that are not his fault despite being genuine and sweet because of his beastly appearance and is used as a scapegoat for truly evil people. All the while, his impossible love never comes close to being requited and when his love is killed on behalf of the very same people who used him, he commits suicide.](#spoiler) The perspectives used in the book really give the reader a taste of the cruelty that is injustice based on prejudice.

TL;DR - This trope is sugar coated to shit, and it takes a lot away from the incredible potential it has, because its true potential is way heavier and probably doesn't have a happy ending.&&I still like this trope, but I'd love to see it reversed, too.&&Splice is kinda like that?&&You should watch Spring. It's a nice romance/body horror movie that's kinda like that.&&Penelope was pretty shitty. &&Shrek!&&Well, this looks like a flip on the traditional ""guy meets mermaid"" story, so there's that.

Its a hilarious New Zealand Mockumentary about the daily lives of Vampires. Think ""The Office"" or ""Parks and Rec"" but with Vampires.  
  
Anyway one of the Vampires fell in love with a girl in the late 1920s and she's old as fuck now and the two of them have become estranged. [At the end of the movie he tracks her down turns her into a vampire and they seem quite happy together, actually. He even makes a joke like ""some people think the age difference is a little creepy but its just a number. Just because she's 98 and I'm 700 doesn't mean we can't still love each other""](#spoiler)&&We got that, it was called Splice!

&&@EltonJuan why does your drawn movie poster sketches not make it to the point they are seen by the studio?

Post a link to your Behance portfolio or something. I'm actually in the area and looking into getting into an ad agency in LA. Maybe we will cross paths at some point &&I believe the Kong skull island poster was also a painting with a bunch of stuff edited onto it.&&was the artist from East L.A.?&&It looks like something that came out of a high school art class.  &&This... Is not great. &&I like it, but the neon-set lighting was my favorite cinematographic part of the film. It's a bit of a shame to see a B&W poster for it. &&The one with all the guns pointed at his head was the best though&&This is fucking awful. &&Speaking of, his [Cabinet of Curiosities book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13277571-cabinet-of-curiosities) that came out a few years ago is fantastic.&&When the world needed him most, he vanished&&Definitely. I'm betting Del Toro wanted to do an Abe Sapien spin-off but the big-wigs said no (it's Del Toro, saying anything other than ""no"" to this genius would be preposterous!) so he continued it under a different name, which turned into this.

And I'm going to regard this as an Abe Sapien origin no matter what because I fucking love the character and I want to see more of him, damn it!&&Right? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Why is no one acknowledging that he lifted his version of Abe and made a movie about it? &&She said it was because he told them not to. He wanted to learn how to lip read. So she didn't, but he only communicates with writing on paper, and now she wishes she could sign with him. &&There were a few quick masturbation scenes, one sex scene.. they weren't focused on the sexuality and more for comedic or narrative effect if that makes any sense. &&Please, it's a [Lakelurk](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Lakelurk).&&There's some quote somewhere of GDT basically saying he watched the movie as a kid, and stated he was one of the ""wierd"" kids who wanted the creature from the black lagoon and the woman to end up together.&&Wait, is this going to connect into Universal's new monster franchise?&&Has to be at least the inspiration. Notice the [spine](https://imgur.com/ooUtSwi) is pretty much the same. &&Its hard to tell from the drawing because it doesn't show his sneakers.&&**I SAW ZAAT AND I CLAPPED!**&&No pharmacy is safe!&&Zaat part 2!&&Dougie Jones! He was great in Twin Peaks&&I think del Toro specifically creates parts for Doug Jones. Which makes me happy. &&I hope, as well as a lot of people, that this is Abe Sapien.&&I though Abe Sapien was meant to be one of the fish/frog people from Shadow over Innsmouth. by Hewlett Packard Lovecraft.&&But it stuck with you. Without it, the movie would've been significantly more forgettable&&That cab he was driving? The Magic School Bus.&&IDK why. Ol aspirin booty. Flat ass with a line down the middle. &&Got a link?&&Is that the one where Belle goes mad in the face of the hideous incomprehensible implications of a cosmos that could allow for such a monstrous abomination?&&Sounds good to me!&&A tale as old as ~~time~~ Cthulhu&&Are you playin your love gaaaames&&Make an assessment.&&Thundergun it up on the curb.&&More like a ding than a dong really&&Like a button on a fur coat. &&[https://i.imgur.com/gLRy2kA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gLRy2kA.jpg)&&I know. I love the idea of the monsterverse but the studio was banking on the characters alone being able to carry it when really they need to have quality as well.

I wish it was better&&Indeed there was. But it was another not-so-good movie. I, Frankenstein&&I think that's just a given to whoever he's playing.&&You didn't think Creature from the Black Lagoon as soon as you saw it? I thought that was the obvious reference.&&Same actor too! Doug Jones&&Agreed. Something I can't explain either. Then I met the man who played him at a convention and found out he played Billy from hocus pocus and that crush increased. Plus he couldn't of been a nicer guy either. &&Oh?&&Same. Still attracted to him too....I need more monster men in my life.&&anyang!&&>  implied

Meh...&&Such a shame too.  Chastain is a babe.&&I liked splice, it was super creepy.  &&It's not just G. Doug is incredible at what he does, and has a body type that allows some dramatic forms. You're right, though. He's just so damn good at pretending to be in water!&&He's Del Toro's go to guy for most creatures. I guess he also played the ghosts in Crimson Peak. &&Great movie&&Jesus is there a name for when you learn about something for the first time then see it everywhere? I watched it for the first time last night, and today I saw a calcifur shirt, and now your comment&&That episode was great. I had it on DVD for some reason. Totally fucked.&&Great episode and special effects makeup. I wouldn't say those guys love her, though.&&Her? With the ponytail?!

Shrek is beautiful imo&&Yeah, Rachael Leigh Cook is such a troll.&&Fish man has a huge dong&&He lifts&&r/fish_irl&&This guy icthyoligies.&&I find Sally Hawkins to be incredibly adorable but she definitely is not the traditional lead.&&This is the only one that fits in the same niche as this, most monster girl movies are too heavily focused on the dark sexualness of the lady monsters. This one actually has a real relationship being crafted by the story.
&&If you think there are few ways to make a beast-woman sexy, you clearly haven't watched enough hentai. &&
> any social commentary it tries to make is lost on the fact that you're cheering for the beast in the first place

The 1967's episode of Star Trek, 'The Devil in the Dark' plays so well with this appearance trope. Half of the episode is about this horrendous rock creature killing harmless miners, and the writing makes you to root for Kirk and Spock to find ways to kill the beast. Then you find out that the cave used to be her fauna, and the rock creature is the last of its species, a desperate mother protecting its eggs. The second half of the episode is about Kirk and Spock trying to save the beast from the miners.

In this decade I noticed a reversal in values of this matter. Appearance became so important that it cannot be put into question, to not be even mentioned. Personalities in TV and movies have no motivation relative their appearance. Everyone is mildly attractive but equally attractive, so it is not a social issue. -and they don't lose audience by casting ugly ducks for the part. 

I thought that The Office would have changed that route, but it went in the opposite direction. What we have on TV now are attractive people with quirks and insecurities of ugly people. It all feels a unreal to me. Appearance matters more than we wish for. 

 &&I'd say a trope is just that, a trope. This one works because it sets up a whole bunch of social cues people can relate to. It's a useful tool, shallow on it's own, but a good basis on which a talented writer can tell a relatable if superficially strange story.

To make a trope the core element of a story, expanding it to have further meaning on it's own, could turn the whole story into something entirely different. Which isn't necessarily a bad, thing, just something very different.

Both ways have lots of value to derive from. I don't think there is much point in condemning either.&&**....Insiiideee yoouuu**&&Curse you, Obama!  Curse you and your Chemicals^^^**TM**!&&She bubblin she floatin &&[deleted]&&He married a Jewish woman despite hating them. Dude was complex. He'd probably have banged an alien too.&&Somehow I get a lot more out of Lovecraft than just ""he's racist"". Dude was born in the 1800s, if he were around today, maybe we could judge him a little harsher.&&You're right, but there was an awful lot of mention of fish people tucking humans in his stories. Maybe he was secretly really into it.&&IDK, we can't attribute all fish people to Lovecraft. He may have started it but I think this character and narrative have more of a Creature from the Black Lagoon influence.

Plus, if we're talking weird fiction influences, Del Toro is far more influenced by Arthur Machen than Lovecraft. But not enough people read Arthur Machen for it to be commonly mentioned. Pan's Labyrinth is basically Del Toro's take on a Machen style story, and this movie feels somewhat similar.&&Lead me to the land; that you understand &&Then abes backstory in Hellboy is false &&Abe has a great backstory already. This wouldn't make any sense.&&Where did you hear this &&That'd be interesting, but isn't it said at some point in Hellboy 1 that he was discovered in the 60s, the exact time period the Shape of Water takes place in?&&No&&Probably not.

You see that building he designed and had a team help paint in Seattle? Shit was sooooo wild and awesome. He really is amazing. &&I tell everyone that and they just kinda continue ranting about the show. :\ I figure it's not worth mentioning that anymore since it holds no real relevance nor strength in any discussion I've had.&&I feel like porn sites are kinda scrubbing his image away, I will only come across a video or two with him in it, whereas before the bad news he used to be all over the place. now all I see is that bald hitman agent 47 looking dude, those 2 British guys (the one who looks like The Sherminator and the other guy Kieren who is clearly old as fuck now), and that really really really weird looking Hispanic guy who looks like he's 12 and can't speak English so he relies on exaggerated facial expressions to convey his thoughts (ex: the lady starts getting undressed in front of him, and it cuts to him doing the fucking Home Alone face). The Shape of Water will be really good, the hype is huge for it&&Actually, I think the title is stylized 'mother!' (which is even weirder)&&[removed]&&I wonder if in movies with a lot of recognizable stars that they have it in their contract that they get to be on a poster. &&I'm convinced Valarian died because of its shitty poster.&&It's not really limited to just recently, floating heads posters have been around for ages.  The difference I think is decades ago even a poster that was just the heads of a bunch of the actors would still be painted, with lots of effort, rather than slapped together in an afternoon by one of the marketing interns in Photoshop.&&I think you see this a lot when you have two A-List actors. Contract negotiations result in a compromise. ""OK, they see his name first, but they have to see my face first.""

*Face Off* listed them in the same order, which is kind of trippy.&&Internally, there are egos that I can't get around. Self censorship more than likely since my boss was an artist before and probably hit a lot of creative roadblocks.

I used to post drawings on reddit that were relatively well received. They're how I got my job, but I'm coming up on three years in and might want to have another go at my own thing. I definitely learned a lot, don't get me wrong. It'll be good experience for you to immerse yourself, provided you don't lose yourself.

However, that may simply be for legal reasons. Somehow del toro and the creator of bellboy had a falling out that prevented him from directing the final sequel.

Plus the whole egg, music, telepathy thing ( I think this was implied in the trailer). Not saying it absolutely is, just that there seems to be way more similarities to Abe than Creature. &&Naturally, Abe was inspired by the Creature from the Black Lagoon, but the reason Abe, specifically, is what comes to mind is in the details: Doug Jones starring in a Guillermo del Toro film playing a fish man that lives in a tank in a government facility that looks suspiciously identical to the BPRD in del Toro's Hellboy.&&He's also the leader of The Gentlemen from Buffy.

I think you mean xenophob, not xenophile.

Robert E. Howard was more of a xenophile, if anything.&&In all fairness, his hate began to slowly diminish near the later years of his life. He hated what he feared, and feared what he didn't understand. Nearly all of his novellas are analogous of this. 

I firmly believe that had he not died at such a young age, he would have grown quite a lot more, morally, as a person. You can see this from the accounts of his close friends within the last few months of his life.&&Even for his day and age he was considered horribly racist by a LOT OF his racist peers. Still, there's more to him and reducing him to being a racist is probably counter productive when talking about his works.&&He was extremely racist even by the standards of his time too&&Del Toro has said himself that Lovecraft was a huge inspiration for him. Check out the documentary ""Lovecraft: Fear of the Unknown"". 

I'd say it's safe to assume Lovecraft has a great amount of influence on his work. &&I've read Arthur Machen's work but i disagree. i can't think of much of Machens's influence in the films of GDT but there's a ton of Lovecraft in there. What Machen influences are there?

Did he do something bad?&&Or dual tone malone&&This guy porns!&&Show us what you got!&&So many floating head posters. &&A lot of recognizable stars make up the advertisement for the movie, usually. The studios hire well known actors at very high rates precisely because their face/name can be used to sell the movie better. [In fact, there was a whole debacle around Disney using Robin William's voice in advertising without his consent](http://www.businessinsider.com/robin-williams-disney-feud-picasso-gift-2014-11).&&My gf works in the industry and it's apparently crazy. Based on their contracts their heads have to be certain sizes/if this actor is shown this one also has to be show/more up front etc. Also they even tailor the marketing to specific stores. For example in the new Power Rangers movie in' lower tier' stores like Walmart they put the black power ranger in front and for stores like target it was the pink white girl. Crazy how in depth they go for marketing...&&[I know for a fact that Steve Carell does.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yET1JeSd7t8)&&I'm curious about that, too. In contrast, I know that for *A Knight's Tale* Heath Ledger (RIP) was really embarrassed that his face covered almost the entire movie poster.&&And not because the lead actors had *such believable* chemistry, and their range of emotion was *so incredibly* broad.

At least the effects budget was well spent.&&I know nothing about drawing or professional drawing or anything like that but damn, those are great.&&Holy shit.

Except for being a blue fish person captured and examined by an agency in the UK in an alternate past, who has a kind heart, likes to eat eggs, and is played by Doug Jones. 

Come on.&&Even if it isn't true, i'll just watch the movie with him in mind the entire time. But wasn't there a hard boiled egg in the trailer?&&My buddy and I had this discussion both on the day the trailer came out and just last night by coincidence. 

The creature bears way too much of a resemblance to Abe Sapien for me to think it's a coincidence. He almost looks more like the comics Abe Sapien than the ones from the Hellboy films does. 

If this turned out to be a secret prequel to the new Hellboy movie I wouldn't mind at all.&&Abe Sapien has some sort of back story being born human during the civil war, so this is definitely not Abe. At least that's what reddit told me last time i told them this was about Abe.

There's a specific shot that del Toro said inspired him, where the creature is swimming deep in the water, in tandem with the woman.

I mean, the red band trailer had her giving him a freaking hard boiled egg and him taking it exactly the same way Abe took his rotten eggs in Hellboy. 

He looks exactly like Abe, he acts exactly like Abe, it's directed by the guy who directed Hellboy AND the creature is being played by Doug Jones, the actor that played Abe Sapien. 

Are you KIDDING me? &&He's much hotter than the creature. The creature has a black lagoona beach bod, but Abe is an intellectual. &&Shape of Water takes place in 1962, the civil war ended in 1865. It could still be Abe.
Edit: The Civil War didn't end the same year it began &&But he was found in a vessel with a note, we don't know how he ended up in the lab in the first place so this could be where the bureau first finds him. We know he's kept in a vessel in part of this film and it looks to be taking place in the 40s or 50s so I haven't seen anything so far that doesn't fit in the Hell Boy franchise.&&Audibly laughed in front of my students, well done&&You should Ask Jeeves about it. &&Dammit Symmetra your portal opened to the blender dimension!&&He wasn't a bad guy in ""Take Shelter"" either (though he might have been crazy he was still mostly concerned for his family)


And in his small role in Mudd he was pretty much just a big brother&&Yes, I've seen the film. Saw it when I was a kid. It was always more of a horror/drama film though than a romance, similar to King Kong in that respect.&&[Enjoy.](https://youtu.be/caj2OoFUXsQ)&&Did the poster want you to see the movie? Or was the thinking ""This poster is cool, but I need to see a trailer?""

I would love to see a movie without being bombarded with previews and scenes. The last time I got to do that was when a friend took me to Pitch Black and I knew nothing about it. I tried to do it again with District 9 when I knew I'd want to see it the first I heard about it, but had to actively avoid all media (the print ads were cool).&&*Oh*

Since Fables is ultimately a Time Warner property, you'd think ABC and NBC would want to tread more lightly.&&Would be awesome they turned it down though if it now got picked up by Netflix (or HBO, Hulu, etc) where it could be as dirty and violent as they like.&&Which is also unfortunately dragged down by a slew of other Telltale games that couldn't deliver a compelling enough experience. :c&&I think Robin Williams being dead is probably the bulk of the reasoning behind the recast &&What the fuck are those zombie Despicable Me minions doing front and center on the poster?&&They're really, really breathtaking.

Edit: word&&I was recently wondering. You see a it a lot where two movies will release close to the same time with basically the same premise. Is the reason for that because someone was going around pitching a movie and the studios told them no, but then went ahead and made it anyway without them just as another studio is making it with them so two similar movies come out near the same time?&&Lmao

*summer 2019*

It 2 vol 1&&I saw It for the second time today and want to know if anyone has noticed this detail.

When Ben is in the library and flipping through the book on old Derry it switches the camera from the book to a zoomed out shot of Ben in the library.

What I have noticed both times now is that there is a woman behind Ben staring directly at him!

It is definitely blurry because the focus is on him but I can very distinctly tell that she is staring at him and even smiling it seems.

It is one of the parts in the movie that actually gave me an uneasy feeling, especially because no one else I have asked has noticed it. &&Okay, without spoilers, how scary is it? I'm taking someone out on a date to see it and don't want to shit myself. Thanks!&&Hate it or love it, I think we can all agree that [Pennywise's friggin' Riverdance](#spoiler) was one of the best parts of the movie for so many reasons.&&[deleted]&&This is the best comeuppance to Harold Bloom and all those irrelevant snobs who scoffed at Stephen King's ability to create long-lasting stories with compelling characters — the man's continued to churn out the terrifying fun for decades, and it's pretty cool *It* is doing so well with movie critics too.

At its heart, *It* is about friendship in the face of overwhelming adversity. A timeless theme and myth that can be adapted for new generations, just as a good melody never gets old, and kudos to all who brought SK's vision to life for those who weren't even born when the original book came out.

I just hope this drives forth more quality SK movies and shows.&&I'm a scared little chicken shit and have no desire to see this, but that's awesome&&I remember the first IT movies with Tim curry. I was worried this new adaptation would be a pale imitation of the original which would flop tremendously.


I'm pleasantly surprised and scared of how well it did. &&Unfortunately trying to see this movie is proving difficult- every showing I've been to so far has been literally packed with just-turned-15 teenagers in groups of like 20 who were there to laugh at each other and take instagram pictures and who wouldn't shut up. When the movie was starting it was genuinely the volume of a crowded shopping centre and their response to staff asking them to be quiet was mimicking the staff and laughing hysterically. Left the cinema while the distributor credits were still playing.

Going back at 22:30 tonight, hopefully no kids this time.&&My wife and I wanted to go see this, but Irma said otherwise. &&I wonder if it is now finally accepted by the studios that it is okay to release big budged R-rated movies rather than forcing/cutting everything into PG. &&[removed]&&holy shit that's a lot of money&&Hopefully this shows studios that they don't need to be afraid of R rated films. Adults do go to theaters when there's a reason. Maybe this could stop the trend of R rated franchises, like Terminator, from getting rebranded and watered down as pg-13.&&""IT grosses $51m on Friday"" 
""What grosses $51m on Friday?"" 
""IT does!""
""What does?!"" 
And so on&&With the price of tickets all it takes is 3 more people going to see the film to break the record 
&&I loved this film. The best horror film in a while and a good escape from the predictable franchise horror films that have come out lately. It's not perfect but it's a damn good time! &&These are mind-blowing numbers. People were being told that $50m-$60m was exaggerating.

The news of a box office collapse has been blown way out of proportion. &&(SMALL) SPOILER: I can't wait for someone to make a HQ .gif of Pennywise waving at the bullies with a severed arm in the bushes. I will respond to everyone in my text messages with that .gif for years to come.&&It would have beat the record for paranormal activity if Miami wasn't in the middle of a hurricane I bet.&&Filmed last year a few blocks away from my house. The creepy house parts and some exterior scenes anyway&&Thanks for making a way better title than I did yesterday. I got probably at least 100 comments of people saying how idiotic of a record it is ""because of all the qualifiers."" I just meant to show how fuckin impressive this film is at the box office.&&As a movie theatre employee I always feel the need to do a quick PSA on these weekends. So here it is:

Things will often be somewhat hectic if you go to see IT in theaters opening weekend. It is hard to handle the massive crowds for many theaters because this movie comes after a massive summer of lower rating movies that drew in far less. Plus with school having just started up, we lose some employees. Lines at concessions may be bad, but more so, the line to get in might be bad. Please be patient, and let us get our work done.

I was working as an usher last night. We had three theaters showing ""IT"" all sold out at almost 300 people. There are only three of us, so there is only so much we can get done in a certain amount of time. We will be doing as much as we can to get the theaters cleaned and turned around for you, but it might leave you waiting in line a little longer than normal. Horror movies tend to leave a lot more trash. Rows absolutely covered in popcorn and trash. With that comes a longer clean time. Please do not try to rush in to the theatre, leading the line with you, it makes our job a lot harder. Please do not yell at us for ""taking too long."" And please do not expect us to be able to get every nook and cranny clean. Certain things will be missed, we are very literally running to get things done.

Also, don't be the asshat that argues over a sold out movie. It happens every time. ""What, sold out! No just sell me a ticket I can stand! Bullshit just let me stand!"" We can not do that. Sold out means sold out, show up earlier, or go to a later showing.

And finally for the parents: Kids. If your child is not 17 or older with ID they can not watch the movie alone. You can not buy the ticket for them and leave. We had to refund at least 50 tickets last night while being berated by angry parents, all for following corporate guidelines that exist at almost every single theatre. We have no choice, it is our job. If I were to let them in, I can be fired. I understand the anger, but it is in no way our fault. Either watch with them, or wait for it to come out on dvd or digital.

I really hope you all get to enjoy watching it. I hate big weekends like this because it makes us all overly stressed, and therefor a little more on edge. All I want for those who come to my place of work is that they get to have as good an experience as possible, and we work hard to give that to you. But with massive weekends like this it gets extremely tough and exhausting. We will all probably end up dealing wth multiple horrible customers yelling at or insulting us, mostly the kids caught sneaking in who will try to fight us or curse at us for as long as they can. We are all going to be carrying a lot of weight behind the scenes. I am not saying this to change your experience, I simply wish to let people know that employees who seem a little cold, or who seem stressed, there is a reason. Please enjoy the movie, and be nice to the employees around you. You have no idea how much it means to see a smile and a thank you in a sea of people who are angry because they had to wait an extra four minutes on their popcorn. 

Edit: well, no longer a movie theatre employee. Quit my job and left tonight. Spent the last two years getting berated by angry parents and kids, while managers acted like we were out of line for creating work for them (aka not selling tickets to minors, also known as our fucking job.). Gm was in the box office tonight and snapped at me for literally quoting the signs we have all over the box office and front door that read ""Anyone under the age of 17 watching an R rated movie must be accompanied by someone 25 years of age or older."" claiming that ""it isn't a rule!"" before walking out. Asked him what the rule was following that and he angrily just said ""they have to be with their parents!"" As if I can fucking tell if they are the parents magically. How about the next mom who has an interracial marriage and child comes up, I deny them service for not seeing proof of relation. So, I spent an hour going over it. I had hated this job for well over a year, mainly due to management problems. Finally came to the decision that if I didn't just get it done with I would keep putting it off, so I gave them my shit and left. But ya know what, haven't felt bad about it a single moment yet.&&For everyone that's curious, Deadpool made 46m on its opening Friday.&&Amazing movie, one of the best horror films I have seen since Cabin In The Woods, go see this in a theater, the audience made it even better &&JUST saw it, got out an hour ago.  Big fan of the book.  Happy to see this film get so much closer to King's imagination.  This film should be nominated for sound, make-up, and visual effects.&&All the marketing must have worked. On Reddit alone I saw more posts about this film than any other film I can think of in the last half year or so.&&Such a great movie! Pennywise is absolutely terrifying. Definitely lived up to the hype. &&I hope there will be more R-Rated films in the future.  Time to shake up that status-quo a little.  Censorship gets in the way of good storytelling.&&""We all float down here""

Watched it yesterday. Great film!&&Oh what The Dark Tower could have been&&I can't over emphasise how happy this makes me. It's such a good movie, and tho I had my issues with the adaptation it really captures the heart and soul of the book. Congrats to the cast and crew&&I'm going to see it again in IMAX tonight, I'm so excited! I loved this movie. It really had some comedic moments to release some of the tension the hit you again with the scares. I hope the experience is great in IMAX cause I'm ready for those loud ass jump scares!

Edit: back from it. Wasn't disappointed! If you get the opportunity GO SEE IMAX. It really vamped up the experience. I honestly think I got more scared the second time around than the first 😂&&...&&No surprise here.  So many people have been talking about this film in social media and in person about wanting to see this.  Trailers have been everywhere.&&What numbers did Deadpool put up? &&Saw the movie today, was surprised at how busy a 3pm showing could get! I thought it was excellent. Read the book several times and enjoyed the 90's mini series (which seriously creeped me out as a kid) and did not expect to enjoy the film this much. Buzzing for what they do with Chapter 2!&&Daaaam and there were so many non believers &&[deleted]&&And that's not even counting a bunch of people from Florida that can't see it because a death cyclone is hurling towards us&&Went to go see IT last night at a Drive In Theater in Warwick NY.  Thought the movie was great and as a long time King fan, was very happy with how it turned out.  Also, someone decided to dress up like a creepy ass clown complete with floating red balloon and walk among the rows of cars scaring the shit out of people watching the film. &&I've watched it twice. Last night 6:50 - too many kids, too many adults acting like children. Talking, phones, loudness - it was not enjoyable. Today 12:10pm - all adults, all relatively silent, extremely enjoyable. I won't truly appreciate it til I'm home alone in utter silence, but it requires an audience that has a small fraction of tact. Why people feel they're entitled to treat a theatre like their living room is beyond me. We all paid for this experience, stop being a selfish piece of shit & take your fucking trash with you, you fucking heathens. &&And now we wait for King's (sort of) The Long Walk to be made into a great film.

Why the fuck has The Long Walk never been made into a film??&&[deleted]&&I hate horror movies and I've never seen the original, but ""It"" is one of the best movies I can recall seeing in theaters. God damn.&&Saw ""IT"" last night in my local theatre, one dude dressed up as Tim Curry's Pennywise and all! Everyone was pumped for it, and by God did it deliver. Everyone jumped near every intense scene, including myself that is a self obsessed IT fan. Couldn't have been more happy with Skarsgards and The Losers Clubs performance. Can't wait for Chapter Two.&&It's almost as if making a good movie is a great way to get more money :/&&'What' did? Very vague...&&I actually think that 'It' really deserves all of the praise it's getting, it's one of the only recent horror movies that has been better than my expectations, and I found it really fun to watch.&&IT was good, it was the best adaption of a King story since Stand By Me and it was better. The kids and the director should share immense praise for the jobs they did here.
The real excitement is transferring the emotion from reading to watching. The director Andrés Muschietti deserves a lot of attention for boiling down the emotional train that was the book and delivering it to a different media.&&Very weird run. Made $52M opening weekend but closed to just over $100M. Had an atrocious drop off post opening. 

IT scored super well on Cinemascore for a horror film so I think it will hold much better and could easily challenge Sixth Sense for highest grossing horror film.&&Those movies made a shit ton of money:
5 films
$28 million budget (total for all 5 films)
$889.7 million worldwide box office gross&&Not sure but I remember seeing it with a group of friends on opening night and it was packed. A lot of teenagers but other people their 20s like us. It was actually one of my favorite theater experiences ever. The crowd was really into it. One girl behind us was practically crying lol. It wasn't THAT scary, but I thought it was great and the best of the series.

I think it had a really good marketing campaign going for it. &&I low key love Paranormal Activity 3. The girl can really see Toby. So that means whenever she says she's having a tea party with Toby...she is. So this killer demon monster thing spends a majority of its time just kicking it with this little girl because it doesn't have anything else to do for a while. Then it will randomly scare people because it's bored and defend the girl because it kind of likes her. I think it's hilarious &&Seriously about 90% of the horror on Netflix is that. &&[deleted]&&That or ""group of kids did something bad and {supernatural force #343843} is back to kill them all. Also every one of the kids is an unlikable douchenozzle.""

See things like Unfriended. ""It's different cuz it's a livestream movie!!"" No it isn't. Outside the gimmick it's a copy-and-paste plot.&&I won't disagree, but I'd also like to see a fresh horror film that isn't a rehash/remake of something that is decades old as well. Not to knock IT at all, it looks very well done and I'm excited to see it.&&Monster movies need to make a comeback. And by looking at these numbers, people agree&&[Oblig RLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSEqVqmYhrk)&&The first trailer was brilliant... everyone thought the movie was going to be shit after they released just the photo of Pennywise, then the trailer dropped and everyone lost their minds because it was so great.&&They will take over Universal Studio this weekend for 2nd position in domestic grosses. Before the weekend only $80M behind i think. &&🎈&&Holy shit&&Goodness. &&Can someone ELI5 what is happening here? You know, for my embarrassingly less informed friends? &&This is simultaneously the best and worst idea.&&This one is 27 years after the original one. Or does everyone already know that and I'm late to the party?&&Well, they pretty much did that already. they could just take the actors that played the kids 27 years ago already in the made for TV movie (at least the one still alive and acting actively)&&[Part 2 is already in the works for 2019.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6z0q3m/part_2_of_it_already_in_the_works_for_2019/)&&I'll be 52...I'm sure I can not die till then&&I saw it in a packed theatre filled with teenagers. Actually had a few kids kicked out because they just would not shut the fuck up. &&The last time I saw a movie this packed at my theater was for Force Awakens. &&What makes it even crazier is that most of Florida and parts of Texas didn't even get to see it because of the hurricane. Next weekends numbers will be huge too. &&You'll float too &&[deleted]&&Just think if Harvey and Irma didn't come through. &&Im going to see IT on Sunday. This'll be my first time stepping into a movie theater in over a decade. &&They spent a lot of money on marketing.  &&The Showcase theater I saw it at was *crazy* regimental about checking IDs for this one, too. Not that it mattered, since every showing sold out.&&Not only is it a well made film but it's also catering to a wide variety of audiences. The older crowd who grew up watching the series, the die hard king fans, and the younger horror lovers. 

I think even if it was just an ""OK"" film it woulda been a major success. &&Beep Beep, Ritchie 🤡&&Maybe it's because there's fucking nothing to watch at the theaters right now&&Sometimes I think people are right when they say I'm a horror snob. And then I remember which movie holds that record and I feel better for having standards.&&How long do we think it will take for the /r/movies backlash?&&Spending my money to watch this movie was a penny wisely spent &&!redditsilver&&IT has history behind it. A lot of adults today watched the original. Pennywise is THE most popular ""clown"" in mainstream society this side of The Joker. Spider-Man Homecoming is the 6th Spider-Man film in like 15 years, so there was some Spider-Man fatigue. Also, Deadpool was rated R, but it was more EXPLICIT in material. As in graphic sex scenes, and significant swearing. You really couldn't bring kids to that. Plus, Deadpool wasn't a very well known superhero. The history of the 1990 one brings a nostalgia factor to this movie. 

IT is rated R, but it's more ""scary"" horror, with added graphic and more intense scenes. You can afford to take kids to this movie. &&I couldn't get tickets to any showings on Thursday. The hype is insane.&&500 seats is not what I would describe as a small town- that sounds like an awesome viewing experience&&My town's theatre had those red balloons tied near the gutter outside and at the theatre exit door.&&It is because the trailers were good and they actually made a decent movie. I really hope it becomes a trend, unlike the garbage pile that they made with the Dark Tower.&&Exactly the way it should be watched, a real crowd entertaining jumpy, fun, horror film. &&[deleted]&&It's not that crazy. This is the first horror movie that looks well done in a very long time.&&Agreed, bunch of crap out there. Looking forward to IT and the new Coen brothers movie.&&baby driver was amazing.&&Hollywood just took Labor Day Weekend off.  A three day holiday weekend in summer, and no studio bothered trying to put out a big movie.&&I think many aren't reading your comment carefully. We really are living in a golden age. I believe we are, at least.&&The director said the kids will be in the second part as well, probably in flashbacks. Really hoping they adapt Eddie Corcoran's story in some way.&&Ben Hanscom's library scene will be insane to see on the big screen&&Luckily, I got to watch it on Thursday. Today, the streets are empty, probably floating.&&Hey kids, let's take our minds off this hurricane and watch a movie about clowns!&&Except now we're actively working on developing semi trucks that drive themselves.

Maybe the reboot will be about a computer virus instead of a supernatural thing.&&Was the dark tower a success?

Not sure about box office but it was a really bad representation of the book.&&Maximum Overdrive is already a masterpiece.&&Shot for shot including the music.&&I agree, having read the book, I've always viewed ""It"" as more of a coming of age tale than anything else.&&Doesn't mean all of those R-rated films will be good.&&Im still giving credit to mad max fury road for that.&&Logan?&&*Pennywise will return in Infinity Wars part 2*&&The Prequel: The Sequel: Electric Boogaloo 2.&&Hey if they want to flesh out a 1000 page book a little more I wouldn't be totally against it. It can easily cover 6 hours of content.&&IT 2 vol 1: The ITsy bITsy Spider&&I noticed that too. It looks like she's not even moving &&I saw that!! I was expecting them to go back to that but she was elsewhere when the camera angle changed. Really creepy shot&&I went on a date last night to see It. The story is told well - just like the book, it centers on the Losers (the kids) banding together against an evil demon.  It's not a gore fest, and at many times, really funny! That being said, it is a horror flick, but I think a great balance. For perspective - it was our 3rd date.&&It's not very scary but it has some scenes that will definitely have you on the edge of your seat. 


I saw it with my girlfriend who hates clowns and she was scared throughout the movie but actually ended up really liking it.

It was really well made and I'm sure you and your date will enjoy it.

Have fun! &&Not very scary. You'll be fine. Pennywise's different forms were actually visually interesting to see and had me more intrigued than scared. It's actually a really funny movie surprisingly&&It's almost a comedy most of the time.&&It has a lot of scares, decent amount are jump scares. That said, the jump scares are pretty minor.

It does a great job of just being creepy as hell.&&That and any other moment of really dark humor  (not funny, but moments of the monster acting clownish), like when [It playfully pretended to take a bite out of Eddie's arm, or when It was watching Mike being bullied and gave him a playful wave with a severed arm](#spoiler). What's weird about the moment you mentioned is [you would think that little jig he did would elicit at least one awkward chuckle in the audience, but at that point I was so sucked in that I thought it was just as strange and creepy as any other clown moment and I was more focused on seeing what that chaotically-evil freakazoid was gonna do](#spoiler). &&Nah, that wasn't a riverdance. That was a ho-down!&&The death of Georgie in the book was terrifying and I didn't think it could get more frightening. The movie actually ramped it up several notches.  I mean. &&> Also, the Georgie in the basement bit ended up way more disturbing than I thought it was going to be after seeing it so much.

The ""puppet"" aspect of it did make it more shocking than it would have been if it had just been ""You'll float too!"" from the trailer.&&For me it was that projector Reel scene  , Evil cloown takes Over a Giant projector is one thing ? [Evil Clown becomes gigantic  , as the projector flicks and he reaches for anyone within grasp ?   Nope Nope Nope.](#spoiler)
 
 I think that's one thing this movie did really well is stress me out , when shit went wrong 3 different things would happen at once  , which kind of overloaded my focus . It made me feel apart of the moment though .&&Let's not forget that one of the greatest films of all time, Shawshank Redemption, was a King novella. As was Stand By Me. Two beloved movies faithful to the books and not a whit of horror-film horror in them. 

King is a great writer who doesn't get the credit he deserves. &&Look, it wasn't that scary... The movie is great because it has heart, the kids are great and their dialogue is real. It has a few gory scenes but it isn't that bad to watch.
You should watch it - here's the link of a critic who nails it imo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_IILFoIhbA&&I'm not sure I'd call it *scary,* but one thing I really liked was that It's presence was fucking *constant.*  Like, every single god damn scene of the movie, you knew he was going to pop up soon.  It was unrelenting and puts the viewer on edge, which is contrasted really well with the constant banter and jokes.&&It really blows out the miniseries - I'm sure even the biggest fans of the miniseries can admit that.&&Re watched the original last night with some friends - yeah not hard to beat.  It's pretty terrible and definitely doesn't stand the test of time.&&Protip from a new dad in his 30s. Sunday morning matinees are your friend.&&We went to the latest showing last night and it was packed with kids and teenagers. It was such an amazing movie but the crowd was horrible. There was some guy in the crowd who would shout things like, ""Surprise!"" Or other dumb shit. The entire movie somebody in the theater was talking loudly, shouting or clapping. But even with all of this I still enjoyed the movie a great deal. 

I seriously cannot wait to actually sit down and watch the movie in my own home when it comes out. 

&&>packed with just-turned-15 teenagers in groups of like 20 who were there to laugh at each other and take instagram pictures and who wouldn't shut up

The real horror movie is always in the comments.&&I went at an 11:10 am showing Friday, and there were a little less than a dozen people in my theater.&&that was my experience last night.  paid extra for imax tickets to get the ""best"" sound & picture possible, and an entire group of teenagers in the row behind us were laughing & talking extremely loud  through most of the movie.  i'm glad i saw the movie, but i can't wait to enjoy it in the comfort of my own home in ~3 months and actually get to listen to the dialogue.&&Wow- I had the same experience and actually left right after the goat scene because of how loud the teenagers were being. Rewatched this morning at the first matinee and it was practically empty. I think I'm officially old.&&Yeah, there was a group of maybe 20 teens when we went to see it today. They weren't actually too bad, other than being a bit late to their seats and using a bloody torch to get there.

One bro behind me said 'fuck off fuck off fuck off' during most of the scary bits which I rather agreed with so I just laughed. And then [at the end when it said 'chapter 1 dotdotdot', he was like ""fuck that, I ain't coming back""](#spoiler) but that just made me laugh.&&Obligatory:

http://imgur.com/a/qDKg4&&Same here. Movie would have done even better if it didn't have Irma and Harvey interfering with its release. &&The trailers created an urgency to see it. Most movies decline in value over time. No urgency means that they may wait for redbox. &&Aren't millennials killing Hollywood? /s&&To be fair a lot of highly anticipated movies did disappoint &&How bout when Pennywise finally breaks out his dance for Bev?&&He's obviously waving at Mike though... The other guys would have freaked out, but Mike was too busy being beaten&&To be fair ive always found it weird when i read, THIS IS THE 4TH BIGGEST SEPTEMBER 3RD R RATED OPENING NOT DIRECTED BY GEORGE ROMERO ON A COCAINE BENDER&&I worked at a theater and everything you said is 100 percent true. IDs dont always get checked but they will for major releases. I remember when i went to my first R Rated movie [that i bought a ticket for] i was expecting to show my id but i went right in. &&We got Blade Runner 2049 coming out soon, I think it's the most expensive r-rated film ever.&&The screenwriter deserves much credit for taking incredibly long material (even for *half* the book) and distilling it down to its essence. &&Don't threaten me with a good time. &&This is what horror always did, it mostly a opening weekend industry. &&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumhouse_Productions#Blumhouse_Productions

They literally have this down to a science. &&Sounds like when we saw the Ring on opening night... people were sitting in the aisles so they could be by their friends (only single seats were left) and the whole room was just filled with this palpable tension. The marketing campaign around the Ring was intense too with the found VHS tapes with *the* video on it so no one really knew what to expect going into it. 

When Samara came out of the tv everyone in the theatre jumped about a foot in the air and the screaming was intense... Afterwards, complete strangers were hugging each other as if they'd just been through war or something equally traumatic. Best cinema experience ever.&&I was crying and shaking shit lol i don't like scary movies but I did it for a date. He was hot but damn idk&&The other 10% are zombie films with titles intentionally misspelled with a 'z' instead of an 's'.&&2000s it was zombies, 2010s it was ghosts, and now 2020s will be clowns.&&Yeah the plot and theme was the same, they just used it to cheap out on the camera work.&&If youre ok with foreign films, thailands film industry is pretty much the mecca of horror films. Ghost ghouls curses killers myths supernatural beings black magic zombies witches wizards witchdoctors sacrifices you name it, they have it. &&Yeah I imagine WB double or tripled down on their marketing after they saw just how popular that trailer became. I doubt even they expected this much excitement.&&Does anyone else see this comment????&&What do you mean? They wrote ""You'll float too!""&&If you're referring to how he generated all the funky words, you can access it here! 

http://www.eeemo.net&&It could be done. Twin Peaks did it. Though that was a 25 year gap. &&Does everyone also know that the dude that played IT is 27?&&It's the reason why he made that comment. Lots of people trying to act knowedgeable while just regurgitating shit they see&&You really want Seth Green in this?&&Poor Jonathan Brandis, RIP. &&Tell them to beep beep&&Ushers dressed as clowns.&&Holy shit, dude. Adolescents. They're the worst in the theater. Trying to impress their friends with stupidity, and they won't stfu. I was scared about that going in to this movie, and sure enough there was some chitter-chatter. But as soon as Georgie died everyone stfu. &&In my opinion they perfectly balanced the horror/jump scare and the lighthearted quick witted kids together. The humour is what made this movie so great&&You'll float too Florida!&&Yep! Living in Florida my girlfriend and I tried to see this today and all movie theaters in our city are closed&&You'll float too! &&Yeh the the problem though...we're all gona float down here in Florida. and I can't see the damn movie.
&&I loved the Cat in the Hat version of IT &&Something tells me we're going to see a slew of horror films with kid actors now (thanks to their relatively cheap acting labor,) as Hollywood latches onto that ONE piece of data when determining what made this film successful.&&Yeah, currently wishing I could've seen this before all the movie theaters closed down for Irma. There's always (hopefully) next weekend I guess.&&Theaters by me now have giant chairs with their own armrests that recline. It's amazing. And tickets are under $12. I love going to the theater now. &&Right? The place that I went to had leather recliners with a little lap table built in. Really surprised me since I haven't gone to the theater in so long.&&This is how I felt about Valerian, and now It. I so rarely go to the cinemas that twice in one year is unprecedented for me.&&I know right! I'll be honest I fell into the hype around the first one because it was something new to the horror scene and wasn't actually that bad. They should have left it at that however because it's like a stage 2 clinger now it appears every time you think you've lost it &&Which horror movies are in your upper echelon?&&Not long brother, not long. I am betting a week before those ""I just saw IT and i hated it"" posts start popping up to reddit praise.

Update: Thanks for all the private messages, very classy. I like that most of you don't worry about hurting other's feeling but just wanted to let you know that not one bit of my self esteem is tied up in your acceptance. Have a nice day. &&There's already a shit load of people who thought it wasn't scary or funny and therefore bad.&&Reddit's liver is almost as strong as Andre The Giant's liver for sure.&&I mean.. the jokes between the losers weren't exactly kid friendly.. let alone the relationship between certain people and their Dad or the themes surrounding that. Definitely not a movie to take the kids to.. I mean if your kids are like 13 maybe, sure. Also Deadpool was a marvel super hero movie and I heard lots of stories of parents taking their kids.&&If I had small children, like 5 year olds I wouldnt take them to see this. If I had young teenagers I would because I honestly feel like this was a great coming of age story for teenagers with characters they could relate to about overcoming your fears and insecurities &&Funny you say that because here in Canada deadpool was rated the equivalent of PG-13. Which I'm actually going to say was exactly the rating I'd give it. 

But IT is rated the equivalent of R. 

Also what graphic sex scenes were in Deadpool? &&this is what good word of mouth does

people are only hearing good things about it so they want to see it too&&Maybe he means a small town can fit in the theatre. &&Does this mean 500 seats in one room or one building? &&Not really. If it's an old theatre, it's pretty normal.

Slope seating, as opposed to stadium seating can fit way more seats in the same floor space. If it's the kind of small town that's maybe the central point of a lot of small towns, the movies could have been the one thing to do and, when the theater was built, 500 people would have been necessary. &&I'd argue that there have been a lot of good films in the last few weeks, but they didn't have the massive marketing budgets or appeal.

Wind River, Detroit, Logan Lucky, Ingrid Goes West, Good Time, Patti Cake$, all released during August.&&What's the new Coen Bros movie?&&That was two months ago though&&Thank fuck. The actors were fantastic and it would have been a shame to not get more of them, even if it would have made sense. Although I think Stan and Mike's actors deserved more to do so i'd be fine with them getting the most scenes.&&You'll be floating too.&&I don't think it was. But a lot of his other recent stuff has been. Like the JFK mini series&&R rated movies that aren't superhero related. Please. &&Can't wait for It 3: Escape to Africa&&The problem is that I feel like the first movie needs to be the two-parter, not the second half&&[deleted]&&Very unsettling moment.&&It's a good movie period. Acting was good, story arc was good, pacing was good. &&bullying is common in this movie?&&But will there be a fourth date?&&Did you get the booty? &&Finn Wolfhard stole the movie.  He was so fucking funny.  &&(Thematic spoilers) As sadistic as it sounds.. I was super happy they conveyed his death that well. His calling out to Bill.. holy shit. And the basement scene where he gets slammed into the water, goddamn.&&[deleted]&&Yep, there's that old joke that ""the best Stephen King movies are the ones that you didn't know he wrote"". Like this anecdote: https://m.imgur.com/72BZ55Y&&I found it relatively scary, but my gf who’s terrified of scary movies really liked it because of how heartfelt and funny all the non-scary scenes are. 

Even if you’re scared of scary movies, this movie is worth it for just how good the rest of it is. The kids are great and the kid that plays Richie is one of the best comedic performances I’ve seen this year. &&It's more intense than scary. It pretty much doesn't let up the tension the entire time, and there's multiple scenes that had me genuinely worried about the characters, despite knowing how the story turns out. &&I was terrified, and it takes a lot to scare me! I think the last movie that scared me was The Babadook, which I know a lot of people didn't find scary...maybe just a certain type of horror scares me. &&I didn't find it very scary either.  But that wasn't a bad thing because it didn't feel like they were trying for *that* to be the draw of the film.  Instead, they let these kids' Loser Club chemistry shine.  And the underlying theme of what these kids fear and, more importantly *why they fear it*, took precedence over the visual horror.  

Really well done film that, sure, could scare some people but I felt like the visual horror of IT took a backseat to the more important aspects of the story.  That said, there were a few pretty unsettling scenes, particularly that fantastic opening.  Skarsgard is amazing.&&I watch a lot of horror movies and found it absolutely horrifying...

&&The miniseries is pretty bad, with the exception of Curry's portrayal of Pennywise, so besting it is not really a high bar to clear, IMO.&&> I'm sure even the biggest fans of the miniseries can admit that.

I assure you they cannot.

&&Yes, honestly I rarely go during opening weekend because of the crowds of assholes. Regretted going last night.&&Or just beat your kids.&&What the fuck...&&Usually because they're not quite as fun the second viewing since all the surprises are known. But this movie was so heavily character driven that already knowing what's going to happen doesn't distract from the surprises.&&It might last a little longer since it's getting good reviews, and October is coming up so theatres may keep it around for that.&&True but that's an exceptionally bad drop off especially for a film opening at Mission Impossible level numbers. &&The only people that want to see horror movies *really* want to see horror movies. &&Horror movie horror movie then bam! academy award winning Whiplash. Not bad Blumhouse&&It really is a science at this point. And they've mastered it. 

Get Out was awesome and deserves its return. But the numbers are staggering. They made 250 million off of a 6 million investment. 

The real kicker for me though is The Gallows which had a budget of 100,000 and pulled in 42 million. Hol-lee-shit. &&they must make more money than the bigger studios (except disney)&&[deleted]&&Why did PA 2 end up costing $3 million when the first one cost $15000? I haven't seen the second one but is it dramatically higher production value or something? I totally understand it costing more, but 200x more?&&Huh, I didn't know they made Whiplash&&That was the most freaked out I'd ever been in a theater.  I remember feeling stressed out and scared for most of the movie, then it seems to end and I got my first breath of relief.  Then the kid's like, ""Why did you help her?"" And I remember thinking ""No!  It's supposed to be over!  Wtf!?""  I was 15 when it came out.  I remember turning my tv around when I went to bed that night.  I didn't want to see it.  Never had a horror movie sit with me like that before, maybe even since.&&World War S&&You aren't a fan of Zombeavers?&&Don't Dead Open Inzide&&Korean film ""Train to Busan"".  Its got most of the zombie tropes but the overall story is pretty sweet.&&AntZ&&Zoombies&&> 2020s will be clowns.


Correction: Town-Terrorizers (instead of House-Haunters). Between IT and Stranger Things, this should be clear.&&I want to see the 80's Alien horror genre make a comeback. (And not just reboots).&&I mean, I hope they make a return to monster films in general. There's a lot of room in that wide genre to play&&You're absolutely right... I'm a huge trailer buff, and I've never seen (bar Star Wars: The Force Awakens) people respond to a trailer like this.  And, a lot of people were chomping at the bit for SWTFA, but IT came out of nowhere and blew up like crazy.  I think I watched that trailer about 10 times the day it came out.&&I think you have to be a virgin to see it&&That 2 years is where the idea becomes a flop.

Just to name a few of over the past 10-15 years. &&1. I don't understand the hype, it is overrated. 

2. This is not even in the top 5 Stephen King movies. 

3. No one is gonna remember this movie after 10yrs so it means it is a bad movie.

4. What else? &&I think people are going to hate it because it is mainsteam horror(albeit good mainstream horror). A lot of people on this sub seem to dislike things because they are ""generic"", ""safe"" and ""mainstream"" instead of discussing actual filmmaking and storytelling. &&I was mainly disappointed in Mike Hanlon. He didn't even need to be in the damn movie. They gave his purpose to Ben.&&I didn't think it was scary or funny at all.&&> Also Deadpool was a marvel super hero movie and I heard lots of stories of parents taking their kids.

I think that was mostly the fault of parents not doing their research. When we had Deadpool here, we would see families come in with small children. When we warned them it was Rated R, they would almost all say ""What? Its Rated R? But all of Marvels other superhero movies were all PG-13"" &&> I mean.. the jokes between the losers weren't exactly kid friendly..

That's  the thing though, many parents out there know kids tend to talk like that when they are away from them. Heck, many parents are okay with it, as long as it's with your friends, and not to other adults, police, teachers, etc. So, it's nothing jarring or unheard of. 

> Also Deadpool was a marvel super hero movie and I heard lots of stories of parents taking their kids.

And the theater I went to, four different ones, there were barely any kids, mostly adults, specifically couples. I even saw some parents take their kids to see Logan, that doesn't mean a significant portion are taking their kids all over the country. 

And that nostalgia factor with the 1990 version plays a huge factor when it comes to the money this one is making. It's a REMAKE, after so many years, and it's a good remake. Remove the history, and let this be some random clown movie, it doesn't make near the amount of money. 

Deadpool may have been Marvel, but it's not tied in with The Avengers universe. Affiliation with the MCU increases the hype. &&>the jokes between the losers weren't exactly kid friendly 

Derry was originally founded as a beaver-trapping town. &&My stepson is 6 and he's begging to go...it sucks to keep telling him no and he cried because of it, but I feel like I'd be a shitty parent if I took him.&&What you missed the sex montage? Starts about 23 minutes in. 

No I did not know that off the top of my head, why do you ask?&&It also helps that the trailer was really good. &&Wind River was a great movie, but really hard to watch. &&Logan Lucky was so good. I hope Daniel Craig gets to do more weird, off the wall roles. Adam Driver was killing it too, I'm so glad I went to see it.&&[Suburbicon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD7etXTEOGI)

The Coens wrote it, George Clooney is directing, and it stars Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, and Oscar Isaac. I'm pretty excited about it. &&I think Ben could do with a bit more development too, the film didn't really give any indication of the renowned architect he'd become. Like him building the dam in the book.&&Well seeing as Stan kills himself before going back to Derry as an adult it makes sense he was kind of a back character. Mike I agree with though&&And hopefully Gerald's Game will be a success on Netflix. I'm a fan of Jeff Howard's work, so I have high hopes.&&Kingsman, Atomic Blonde, Mad Max Fury Road, the Fifty Shades franchise, Manchester by the Sea, the Conjuring franchise, and Girls Trip were all rated R and span genres (and quality). R rated movies have been back for a while now. It just is rare that they open this big.&&Solely horror? Or maybe Drama? I'd kill for more Full Metal Jacket style dramas.&&Absolutely. I think the kids part of the story is way more compelling, either that or the 1990 version did a shit job of telling the adult's stories.&&Agreed&&The kids call themselves the Losers club...And yes, they are bullied/harassed by older kids.&&That kid is gonna do great things. He was fantastic in this and Stranger Things. Looking forward to his career.&&Seems to be a problem with all genres these days.  So many trailers and promotional material, you get all the 'good' stuff in the trailers and then you watch the movie just to see what order they are supposed to happen in.

It's always slightly disappointing when you reach a joke or event in a movie and you can feel the anticipation in the air only because everyone in the audience already knows what is going to happen due to the trailers.&&You could say, It had the right stuff. &&Finn Wolfhard crushed it as Trashmouth Tozier. Like seriously, kid has some acting chops. I hope him the best with his career.&&The kid who played Richie was funny? That's weird, but I've seen some stranger things&&Yeah, Richie's actor is definitely going to be the new kid on the block&&It's all subjective I guess... I admit I don't remember when was the last horror movie that got to me - maybe Martyrs few years ago&&Yeah like... I get the following as it was terrifying as a kid. But, the IT miniseries wasn't ""good"" in the sense of well made and well acted &&The reason reddit likes it so much is because its really one of the first scary movies they saw. I mean...wasnt it an ABC made for tv movie? Rewatch it and you see its practically an episode of Goosebumps with a few scary scenes&&Yeah it really didn't age well. The kids half is still pretty good if you can overlook the sometimes wooden acting, not much use of background music and literally zero special effects.&&I am a HUGE fan of the original and the book. This reboot is such an incredible experience. I still love the original, Tim Curry is a tough act to follow but This version was not only an incredible horror movie, but also an overall incredible film.&&You need Alamo Draft House in your life. &&Idk. There's something about a packed theatre and having everyone jump at the same time along with you. That's more enjoyable to me than sitting in a 3 week old movie basically by myself. 

But yeah, the hordes of teenagers kinda sucked. &&Exactly. IT definitely has a re-watchability factor whereas Paranormal Activity did not. Aside from the brilliant performance from Bill Skarsgard, The Loser's Club made this movie so damn entertaining and you're invested in them throughout the film.

But why Paranormal Activity did well in the first place? Because of all the hype that was surrounding it. It was the first ghost found footage of its kind. It drew significant praise so much so that it caught the attention of Steven Speilberg and Paramount Pictures. The marketing revamped and that hype made so many people want to go opening weekend to feel that scare that was being described. But once you experience it, it's hard to go back on a second viewing. And the ones that wanted to experience it the first time, already did so opening weekend.&&I've read the book once a year for the past 17 years.  I knew what was going to happen, and I'm still going to watch it multiple times.  Great movie &&I believe it opened Halloween weekend. The opening numbers obviously sky-rocketed as a result.&&Whiplash has real life horror elements. It's basically about emotional abuse. &&Dont forget the movie that really got the studio started...paranomal activity. $15,000 budget and pulled in 193 million.&&I went to middle school with one of the main characters. The whole thing struck me as a project someone made for a film class that someone's parents bankrolled into an actual movie, I mean, the actors all play characters with their actual names&&Since it came out so long ago now a lot of people don't remember that The Blair Witch Project grossed $250 million against a $60,000 budget&&They may backload actor pay as a % of gross.&&That is a great podcast and a very good episode.&&Unfounded speculation: director/writer and producers getting paid more for the sequel.&&Ah yes, the famous middle school war.&&By Apple&&More than you know sir.&&I only watched that movie because Bill Burr mentioned he had a part in it so thought I'd check it out lol. &&*Sombeavers&&Yeah the idea that there's gonna be a shit ton of clown-based movies is hilarious. 

Though I wouldn't mind a shot-for-shot remake of Killer Klowns from Outer Space&&It'll still be somewhat rare to get out of haunted house movies permanently though. They're very very, very very, very very cheap to make. &&It wouldn't be completely brand new, but I'd like to see a competently done Alien: Isolation movie. Really liked the setting, atmosphere, and general plot. 

Aliens is good, but too action-oriented, not a fan of 3 or Resurrection, and Prometheus and Covenant focused too much on filling in the history of the Alien species mixed in with some ""all of these professional crew members are retarded"" horror. Alien is still the best, and Isolation felt like the most competently-done followup anyone has accomplished so far.&&*Life* was pretty.. well.. disappointing. Great ideas, but would do better with them as parody/comedy on this genre, IMO.&&As a fellow trailer lover, there have been some truly excellent trailers recently. The It trailer, the Stranger Things ""Thriller"" trailer, the Thor: Ragnarok trailer with Immigrant Song.

But then again I guess there's the Justice League trailer of noise and more noise so maybe it isn't all great. &&10.000 Days. &&Maynard is waiting 10,000 days to release it. &&So when I'm dead? &&Depending on your opinion of the definitions of ""blockbuster"" and ""production cycle"", probably Avatar.&&Here we go, ""Boyhood"" not sure if this counts for blockbuster, but 12 years http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/&&[deleted]&&The creature actually resurfaces an approximate amount of time.

I know that there is a Dark Tower TV series in development (and a showrunner has been hired), but no networks or streaming services has signed on to do the show yet.

Maximum Overdrive is by far THE best Stephen King movie ever.&&Mine is, ""This is the first semi-interesting movie with wide appeal to come out after one of the worst Summers in movie history, and that's the only reason it was able to achieve anything resembling acceptance and popularity.

Even if said elite is nominally on the fringes that's just the scum persecuting it, which only shows how elite and special it actually is on the inside. &&Even then it's still unique from modern mainstream horror films.

Mainstream horror films are basically the James Wan styled horrors like Conjuring, Sinister, Insidious, Annabelle, and so on with the spooky things being normal people in death make up.&&Or maybe because not everyone likes everything. Everyone praising a movie so much, will obviously make the people that dislike it want to say that they didn't think it was so good.

Teenagers? Sure take your 13 year old if they want a good scare. But the themes, undertones and gruesome nature of some of the scenes are not your typical PG-13 jump scare stuff. There is nothing about his movie that makes it great to take the kids to and it's just as not kid friendly as Deadpool. 

Just because we watched the TV miniseries when we were their age doesn't mean an R rated clown horror movie with heavy adult themes suddenly OK for kids. Lordy.
&&I've been using Common Sense Media to figure out if I want to take my kids around that age or not.

That's a subtle way they hinted at it without having to waste screen time on something like that.

&&[deleted]&&I mean they already made that movie, it's called Alien &&> Aliens is good, but too action-oriented

I mean, that's kind of the point. Alien is more of a horror, but Aliens was intentionally done as more action.
&&I hear you but I just want to point out that the original crew in ALIEN did some pretty stupid decisions too, it's not just a Prometheus/COnvenant thing, we just didn't notice it as much when it was Lambert/Kane/Dallas making all the terrible decisions (like Dallas breaking quarantine with Ash's help to let Kane on board). One of the major takeaways from ALIEN was the fact that Ripley, a woman in a 1970's horror movie, was the most logical and rational thinking person in the entire film and she survived through following the rules and using protocol, which nobody else did. 

Crew members making dumb choices is a major theme in all the ALIEN movies, we just didn't notice it as much in the earlier films.

As a book fan I liked the movie just fine. But I really think it would have made an excellent HBO series.

Don't you wan't a ballooon?&&I thought that was odd when reading the book for first time last year.&&""Indie"" aka mainstream 20-40 million dollar films they they think are indie because they aren't blockbusters.

&&And Quintopher Nolantino films.&&I saw that and was like ""wow, how generic""&&Exactly this. Mainstream films can be pretty great if the film is in good hands. Steven Soderbergh is a brilliant example of a guy who can make good mainstream/commercial films.&&Well, the problem is Ben seems to have taken his place as the Derry historian and they've dropped his background as an engineer so I think he'll end up being the one who stays.&&I think it only feels odd because he's only in the movie for a scene after that until the last act. He's missing from much of the first two acts so those first two scenes feel weirdly placed.

I think they should have just had him be friends with them from the start. There's no need to separate him from the others because right now he seemed like the token black guy who conveniently had a weapon that became important later on.

I don't know how it is in the book since I haven't read it, but for the story they were telling here it would have worked better if they already knew him as a close friend.&&Fellow patrons who don't want to hear crying children during the movie also appreciate this comment.&&Yeah...I just kind of kept him in mind while I was watching the movie. Consensus at the end was that either the kid would be traumatized or I'd pay for a ticket to watch about 30 minutes of the movie.&&There is a graphic rape scene I believe.&&A shame they give Ben Mike's history hobby, now Mike really has nothing going on other then ""tormented black kid.""&&Stranger Things is quite open about the overwhelming influence that Stephen King tales had on its own screenplay, so it's not surprising It has some similar vibes to it.&&The kid that plays Richie in the movie is in stranger things.&&The Bill adult actor was enough to fuck it up.

""Oh, nothing special.""&&Possibly? I just know in the novel It awoke in 1957, and again in 1984. There are only about 4-6 dates given for It's awakening, and It came to Derry thousands and thousands of years ago, so kind of hard to draw an average from that information.

EDIT

These are the known dates for It waking up:  
1715  
1740  
1769   
1851  
1876

I think he could've written something else and it work. That being said (again, haven't seen this movie) the turtle scenes and how they kill IT would be pretty welcomed.

It felt like we were missing maybe 10 minutes or so of more coming of age stuff to really flesh out that character. Right now he's just there to provide a weapon with no real reason to be there since we didn't see any bonding moments for him with the others.

Much more charismatic and a better leading man than that awkward two years of studios trying to make Taylor Kitsch the next Tom Cruise.&&Everyone is excited for Pacific Rim 2 but I'm just hoping this forces an [Atlantic Rim 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2740710/).&&Colorizebot&&The teaser and posters are not doing much for me but I know the second I see an actual trailer with robot fists in monster faces, I'll be super hyped. &&I know this poster is meant to stylize the Jaeger's face and all, but that resultant contrasting cold metal/monochrome look is way too badass.&&Looking good, though I'm a little worried that they still haven't shown his co-pilot. I'm hoping that they're just keeping everything else about the movie under wraps and they're not hinting at the two-pilot system being gone this time around.&&Those Kamina sunglasses just have to be intentional.&&The fact that Guillermo del Toro is not the director of this sequel can't lessen my level of hype. YES !!!!!!!!!!&&YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!&&I like that they did't call it Pacific Rim 2: 2Pacific 2Rim&&I am excited beyond words.

The best part of Pacific Rim was the terrible, terrible science.

""This robot is analog."" (Shows clearly digital displays on the inside)

""Pure iron, no alloys!"" (Because iron is great for large structures that will be dropped from the sky into salt water, right guys? And also alloys are bad?)

Humanity is so pissed off from the last time that they spend years preparing a final counterattack to take the fight to their enemy.  They willingly re-open the portal and send an army of mechs through to kill everything they see.  There is low gravity or some shit so the robots fly around and they are basically just Gundam.&&You could take out the Pacific Rim and tell me its a poster for a new Halo game and I wouldn't even look at you funny.&&YESSSSS Birthday movie!!!&&I feel like Pacific Rim is a movie that didn't need a sequel, but I'm glad as hell it is getting one. &&never forget: the sword button&&Oh, its John Boy-Jaeger.&&This's the guy said no black actor in GoT.&&Pacific Finn &&My mates have started a [Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/podcast/premiere-quest/id1267651304?mt=2) about Pacific Rim Uprising.

Edit: grammar &&Man I loved this movie. I love how each country had its own uniqe jaegar design. 
I loved how it was set in Hong Kong. I loved how America wasn't the top dog and I loved how there wasn't a cheesy romance forced into it.  Just such a nice refresh. &&Looks like a video game cover. Dig it. &&I'll probably get downvoted but I thought a lot of people weren't really fans of the first? Makes me wanna rewatch.&&I'm glad Boyega is blowing up and becoming a big deal in cinema.

FUCK.ING.AWESOME&&Reminds me of the [Timeshift](http://www.dvd-covers.org/d/4364-5/TimeShift_DVD_PAL_f.jpg) box art.

Had to Google because I never played the game and couldn't remember the title.. but definitely the first thing I thought of.&&I really like Boyega.  Seems like a really nice guy.
&&Spartan Locke is in the new pacific rim?&&John Boyega was by far the worst new actor in the Star Wars reboot. I nearly disliked the movie because of him. I hope he doesn't ruin this franchise as well.&&/r/justfuckmyshitup&&considering that Del Torro and Charlie Hunnam aren't involved in production, I have a strong feeling this movie is going to SUCK BALLS&&Restarting so we can re-cancel.

It was so hype that I almost couldn't contain the excitement while watching it! The first scene where you see the robot launching for the first time, I almost jumped from my seat!

I never watched it again after seeing it in the theater. I'm afraid that I won't like it as much as the first time.&&FOR MY FAMILY!&&I remember my friend was so annoyed by that like WHY DIDNT THEY JUST USE THE VOLTRON SWORD THE WHOLE TIME?!&&cheesy, but not too cheesy.&&SWORD CORE ONLINE&&It got 70% on RT and is at 7.0 on imdb.  Not the worst received movie&&That in my opinion was sticking true to the source material of fighting mech anime and manga. People always whine that movies don't stick to their established stuff and though Pacific Rim was an inherently American take on the genre I like to think of that as it's inspiration.

Also it catered to my love/hate relationship with the trope that sword beats all. It's a great trope if you are trying to be silly, as was done here, but a terrible one if you want to be taken seriously.&&The scene where a oil tanker ship is used as a sword is my favourite movie moment ever. Upon reflection  it was pointless to use it but badass nontheless. &&Exactly that. His illegitimate son apparently.&&I thought he was supposed to be a young Pentecost, in a prequel, because to be honest a sequel doesn't make any logistical sense, they went through and destroyed the other dimension where as a prequel could show us mankind deeply embroiled in the Jaeger/Kaiju war that destroyed a lot of the earth.  Plus there's just so much lore in this universe why wouldn't you want to see how things came about&&I know, right? Whoever thought Master Chief was a black dude?&&I also love that it’s not the overused usual teal/orange color scheme.

The orange accents on a dark grey/black background spring right into your eye. Like a warning sign.&&And it doesn't give away any of the actual plot of the movie which is nice.&&To be fair this is a teaser poster. They're usually pretty tasteful since they're meant to generate hype, not go HEY ROBERT DOWNEY JR IS IN THIS YOU LIKE HIM RIGHT?!?

This is it, the first official meme of the movie.&&The main robot has a rocket in its elbow so it can punch harder.&&Charlie Day plays a Godzilla enthusiast.&&Robot fights that are actually cool and aren't just a cluster fuck of shakey cam like transformers.&&When I first saw the previews years ago about 6 months before the movie came out it looked ridiculous. It looked like the dumbest thing I've ever seen before i  my life.  All I could do is shake my head and say to myself that this is nothing more than Mighty Morphin Power Rangers but for adults. Then I looked up in the mirror and realize what I was saying to myself and said ""wait a second this is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers BUT FOR ADULTS!!!!""

And it was fucking glorious. &&It’s a giant robot vs giant monsters movie that’s actually engaging, with somehow likeable characters. And you can follow the action unlike in the Transformers movies. Huge robots done right!

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a dumb movie, but done properly! I love it.

Edit: The [Honest Trailer of Pacific Rim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fupWquPNoTc) is spot-on! The movie is dumb, and it’s awesome! It’s a movie where you actually get a fantastic feel for how huge and massive the robots and monsters are.

>“So, relive the summer’s guiltiest pleasure that’s either **The Most Awesome Dumb Movie Ever Made** or **The Dumbest Awesome Movie Ever Made**

>...

>Let’s be honest, this movie was super dumb, but I still cannot wait for the sequel.”&&>  am I missing out?


Yes. 

>What's so good about it?

Virtually everything. Its a Giant robot movie done right.  The action is great, and you can actually tell what is happening. The robots move like they have actual weight,  ane Guillermo Del Torro used a LOT of practical effects for a movie about giant robots fighting aliens. He had an entire set built, that could drop 15 feet move and shake around, for the ""Inside the robo cockpit scenes"". 


The world building is great, the whole thing feels like a lived in Universe.  There was a lot of comparisons to the first Star Wars, and how you're just dropped into this existing story, where this war has been ongoing for years.  


Most of the characters are even great. Even the B-Story is good. &&Del Toro. Look up how he made most of the scenes where the pilots move the robots. As usual he wants to make as little CG as possible. Dude made the entire robot head, on top of hydraulics to make it move and rumble as they receive galons of water. &&It isn't a good movie, but it is a great movie.  You need to recognize that fact as well. &&It has a giant robot using an oil tanker as a bat to kill giant interdimensional aliens. Fuck yeah you're missing out&&You need to watch Atlantic Rim first if you wanna watch Pacific Rim.&&It's an amazing movie with a fun plot that sets up for a lot of great big alien/robot battles. Also there is a love story that never develops or wastes your time, like you know it's there but they don't bore you with half an hour of it. Literally in my Top 5 favorite movies!&&I've heard described the following way (which I immediately took for my own)

""It's the most awesome dumb movie ever, or the dumbest awesome movie ever!""&&I'm going to get downvoted to hell because I've said this before on Reddit, but the first is a godawful movie. The plot and dialogue was so cliche. There isn't nearly enough fighting for a movie that's supposed to be about exactly that. The fight scenes don't last long enough, so you're left with the horrible plot and boring as fuck characters. I *love* Guillermo del Toro's work, and this movie makes me so angry it's so bad. The movie is really pretty to look at, and the characters *look* badass, but what you're left with is just another movie like Transformers where you don't care about a single character except at least in Transformers the fight scenes last longer than 5 minutes and Spoiler: [new characters aren't killed off right after being introduced to them](/spoiler). I honestly do not understand the cult following this film has.&&It rains a lot&&He was too busy making a movie where a chick fucks the Creature from the Black Lagoon.&&When Legendary got purchased by a Chinese conglomerate, the production was pushed back by nine months. Guillermo had already been waiting for years, so he decided to go and make The Shape of Water instead. He's still on as a producer, though, and he helped pick Steven S. DeKnight as his replacement.&&So we can get a potentially oscar winning gothic romance from del toro and more kaiju action in the span of a few months. I loved deknights Daredevil season, so I trust him totally&&this has me concerned. :(&&Simple Kaiju movies that don't pretend to be anymore more than fun entertainment are great. I didn't expect Pacific Rim to be some Oscar level drama. I wanted large robots fighting large monsters. And i got that. &&I'm so glad it's happening. I saw the first one in IMAX and it was an amazing experience. Hope this one is good.&&Yeah, the first was pretty well-done too/underrated.   I like Charlie hunam (when he's not doing British accents) and Idris Elba (when he's not doing American accents), and Evangelion was one of the only animes that I liked growing up (I'm  assuming that's what it was based on)&&[?](https://i.imgur.com/2suUp57.png)&&At NYCC next week (online right after).&&> John Boyega

What the hell I didn't even recognise him.&&He an evolved stormtrooper.&&He's kind of a big deal.&&Exactly my thoughts, it looks like it could be a poster for a Halo Movie.&&I can almost get behind this except for that part where Master Chief is a pale red-head.&&More like Locke&&Looks more like Captain Locke's helmet.&&He's supposed to be Idris' son I think&&""Uprising"" is so generic. There have been like 15 games and movies since The Dark Knight Rises that have made use of Rise/Rises/Uprising/RiseUpping/Risen/Rised/Rizzled/etc

I have no real stats on that. It just feels wrong. Maelstrom is absolutely the better title.&&He's only kind of a big deal.&&Don't forget those few years where Hollywood was like ""Here's Sam Worthington!"" and America was like ""We're good, thanks.""&&[deleted]&&He was almost the lead in Baby Driver apparently. While I liked Elgort in the role I can't help but wonder what could have been. &&Kitsch is a good actor. But he's a little too chill bro type off camera to be that charismatic a star&&It's unfortunate, I really like taylor kitsch. Just not as a leading man. &&> awkward two years of studios trying to make Taylor Kitsch the next Tom Cruise.

ya instead we'll get many more awkward years of studios trying to make Boyega the next Denzel

&&How do movies like this even get made? Why?&&Man Graham Green hasn't been able to score a good role since Mr Crabby Tree. &&Here's what I came up with: https://i.imgur.com/fbcqGom.png

^^^^^***bleep*** ^^^^^***bloop***&&> monster faces

I read this as monster feces on the first pass. Way different movie.&&Mark Hamill. &&I actually think I heard that it is ditching ""the drift"" concept, yes. It must have been on a podcast like The Weekly Planet, though. I can't find an article I read.&&Same. My hope is that if they do have single pilot Jaegers, it is only for the first half (maybe first two acts?). Then something happens where they have to use an older model and two pilots used to working alone have to drift to get the job done. &&[I gotcha, buddy.](https://i.imgur.com/VYBNPLs.jpg)&&oh no. I came here looking for this. Guillermo is such a visual artist, which is half of what I liked about the first movie.&&Also DeKnight has a pretty solid track record&&I need more mechs punching kaijus in my life.&&No, no, it all makes sense I swear!

>""This robot is analog.""

I think that's idiomatic, they don't actually mean that it's not using computers but that it's old-fashioned.

>""Their head takes 3 days to drill through."" (So we're going to kill them by... punching them. In the head.)

Shock damage is different, even if you can't actually penetrate the skull you can still cause internal bleeding and maybe even spall bone off the inside of the skull if you hit it with your rocket-propelled fist. Completely legit.

>""Pure iron, no alloys!""

...yeah, okay I got nothing. Boy it's fun though!&&Eh to each his own. I liked him in Star Wars. He seemed relatable as just a normal guy way in over his head who tried to rise to the occasion. Not everyone is born an action badass and I think his character was well written. &&He's going to ruin it. He's not a good actor and he got all pissy because GoT didn't want him so he tried to slam the series as being racist. &&He's honestly not that great of an actor but watch us both get destroyed for saying negative things about him.

Also yeah I agree with that bit you said about him on Star Wars.&&It's like Goku. You killed all the bad guys cause you're so badass that you need to find more bad guys to quench your bloodlust. &&And then it just sorta ends &&Robot Jox was a favorite of mine when I was a kid. So fun to watch these types of movies now. &&This is how I defend this movie, it's giant robots fighting monsters, it's not supposed to be Schindler's List. &&I rewatched recently and it holds up.&&That moment when Striker Eureka is disabled. The Kaiju is about to smash it when a spotlight shines down on it and Gypsy Danger is dropped into the harbor... damn... I went for 6 to midnight.&&I've watched it about a dozen times so far.  Fun every time.&&That line made me laugh so hard. It's such an over-the-top massively cliche line, just too perfect for the movie &&I remember tearing up at that part because it was just... too goddamn cool.&&That was the scene where I could no longer be convinced that movie took itself seriously.  It was such an anime moment, no way they wrote that and said ""this is where we will draw in the Oscar nomination!""&&Kaiju blood is toxic so they do everything they can to not spill their blood. &&The annoying part about that was the kaiju that flies by flapping its wings managed to get to space carrying a jaeger. &&That's mostly western opinion, it was very well received in Asia. But the Japanese love huge robots, and their love for huge robots spread throughout Asia so it makes sense the movie was popular there. &&...Did Shonda Rhimes write this? Anytime you want a new character in greys anatomy it's somebody's illegitimate kid.   &&His illegitimate son who likes to imitate his dad's haircut and occupation? 

...


Alright checks out. &&Hopefully it is Creed... but with robots and aliens.&&Idris Elba = I watch


His son = I watch cause even though they aren't even related the star power of that man is enough to get me there by proxy.

&&Oh so because he's *black* all his kids are illegitimate, huh? *Geez*, Hollywood. He doesn't even have the same accent!&&I think they only destroyed the bridge to the other dimension or like one breeding facility&&It's set 10 years later, the Jaeger program has become the pinnacle of humanity's defence force, and recruitment for pilots is wide and sweeping in order to prepare for the return of the Kaiju. And boy, do they return. Cat 5's will look like tadpoles compared to the new enemies.&&Well they couldnt have destroyed the entire dimension, they probably just destroyed all the kaiju shit nearby. But now the kaiju are angry and they are coming back.

idk, but i think there is defs a possibility of it going either way

although ""uprising"" could suggest the uprising of the kaijus. although im not sure how interesting that story could be since we already know the outcome&&/r/unexpectedmasterchief&&Funnily enough, the visor looks more like an orange version of Agent Locke's helmet.

I saw the trailer and it appeared to be ""giant robots fight giant monsters "" and I'll be damned if I didn't get exactly what I paid to see. &&I think this looks generic and worse than the image above.

A friend of my cousin's got free tickets to an early IMAX screening of the movie and he invited my cousin who in turn invited me.  I decided to go and was floored by the end of the movie.  I was expecting something worse than Transformers and I got Godzilla with giant robots, my inner child had a blast that entire movie.

This was the most accurate review I've seen for anything in my lifetime.  

So awesome. 

So dumb. &&When earth is attacked by giant alien monsters, humanity will pool all its resources to build giant robots TO PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE!

So gooood&&Man, that giant moving robot head he did for the scenes where the pilots move the robot is just insane. &&Main characters with no chemistry didn't kiss at the end thank god.&&The one thing that killed me, as an Alaskan, is the expense spent on saving Sitka, a city of like, 8,000. On an Island. Does it really need a 20 story tall concrete fortifications?&&But the story and acting is pretty poor. The plot drags, and the ending is a deus ex machina.

I just want to say that I enjoyed PR. I only bring this up because movies like Avatar gets crucified on reddit, but IMO, it was a better ""movie"" than a lot of movies that get a pass. &&I would suggest avoiding Indian Rim altogether though.  Movie goes in a totally different direction...&&I saw that recently and you're the first person to ever mention it. That movie...&&I don't know why this comment made me laugh so hard.&&I think you mean the Hellboy origin story for Abe. &&Too busy making projects he would later cancel. &&I think this is his first film too.  I've been a fan of his shows, so it'll be interesting to see a full length movie of his.&&It had some emotional appeal nonetheless.

A man watched his son make the ultimate sacrifice, Jax Teller overcame losing his brother to contribute to the greater good. Humanity was unified among nations against this threat.

Those concepts would be oscar bait on a smaller budget.&&me too! I love it. I wonder if Charlie Day will be back&&Charlie Hunnam is a Brit though.&&It was actually inspired by Patlabor. Del Toro said that in an interview. 

A Live-action Evangelion movie could be a huge mess.&&I'm glad to see someone beat me to the Turn A reference&&Hope it can live up to the original or even surpass it! Pacific Rim was the Transformers movie I always wanted&&I'm stoked for that panel. I usually don't wait for panels but I might wait for that one.&&> What the hell I didn't even recognise him.

Looking like John Manega&&Probably the mustache.  &&So like a Super Trooper? &&Aww now im sad.&&Seriously can we get a Halo movie already!?&&John has brown hair. &&I remember reading the theory when the title was announced that it would be named ""Uprising"" because it'd be about a group of Jaeger pilots going rogue and fighting other Jaegers. Then the name ""Uprising"" would make sense.

Then they said that's not the plot and confirmed they just don't like cool names for their movies.

&&Studio heads seemingly had trouble realizing Avatar made so much money because no one had seen a sci fi movie that looked like that and it was an IMAX 15 bucks a ticket spectacle.

I think that's a bad idea. Requiring two pilots is a good excuse for more character interaction and dialog during the action.  Instead of requiring the character to do a bunch of stupid internal monologing like in anime, or just having them talk on the radio to 'command'.

I wanted so badly for it to be really serious but you're right there were just too many anime type moments. &&This is the answer right here.

I love a movie that can just have a good time without being ashamed to present what it is: in this case, giant robots punching giant monsters in the face.  Plus on top of that, you had a few better than average performances, cool as shit character and location design, and characters who are bizarrely all treated with respect (even the mad scientist duo who are the but of most jokes get their moment.).  No fridging, no pointless wangst, no lame ass 3rd act misunderstanding, no shoe-horned romance (although a little lustful gazing), just good honest fun.&&[deleted]&&I loooved their dynamic!&&Yes.  Yes it does.&&I just treat it like porn, the story is just there for some context.&&To be fair, Idris Elba delivered the best apocalypse speech since Independence Day&&I honestly enjoyed the story, I thought the main over-arching plot wasn't bad. Perlman, Elba, and Day really made the movie for me. The acting was a bit of a mixed bag from the rest of the cast, and we all could have done without the ham fisted attempt at a love story. In the end though, a good movie about robots fighting monsters, and I'm pretty happy with that.      

edit spelling&&The story is a classic. 

That is to say, it's Beowulf. Mankind's prosperity brings a monster from the depths to wreak havoc upon the halls of man. A champion arrives to vanquish the monster. The threat worsens, as the monster's mother attacks (in the case of PR, the Kaiju homeworld sends more Kaiju and represents a constant encroaching threat). The champion of mankind goes to her lair and kicks the shit out of her. Then nukes her home.

The sequel must finish what is left of the poem, so I'm predicting it ends in tragedy with the simultaneous death of the foe and the main character.&&I may regret this. But, why does Avatar get crucified? And are we talking about James Cameron's or the one we shouldn't really talk about? &&Let me guess, giant robots singing and dancing is not your cup of tea?&&Yeah, and Mediterranean Rim was mostly a 90 minute ad, no way such huge robots could be powered by Olive Oil&&Mia Khalifa rocked that one &&Abe? Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?&&What if they're the same movie&&And don't forget- Stacker Pentacost (and how badass of a name is *that*?) gave a speech that rivals President Whitmore's Independence Day speech.&&I have to admit, I teared up and/or cried three more times than I expected to during that movie. &&If the acting were any good at all...but hey, that’s not why I’m watching it&&I hope so. I really liked him in that movie even though I kept expecting him to go on a tangent about bird law.&&He is. Not sure to what capacity, but he's back. So are Burn Gorman and Rinko Kikuchi.&&Well fuck.  It really didn't sound real in The Lost City of Zed.  I guess I just got too used to Jax Teller's voice.

Edit: that's actually funny, considering that when I saw Pacific Rim for the first time, I was surprised by Idris Elba's accent/didn't know until then that *he* was British.&&I liked the first Transformers movie but I was seventeen at the time and haven't seen it since... I'm not sure how it holds up, I've pretty much hated all of the others. I am excited about this movie and I hope they make it feel like a Guillermo film, that man has so much charm in his style. It was silly but it was done really well and I got everything I could ask for.&&You boys like Mexico?&&and the fact that the 3d parts of it were actually nice and not just the usual shoe horned in shit&&Eh, I'm pretty sure he was already signed on for a bunch of garbage like Clash of the Titans and Terminator Salvation before Avatar actually came out. He'd also auditioned to be freaking James Bond in the reboot but just  lost out to Daniel Craig. It wasn't just Avatar that made them think he was bankable, they just had that notion anyway.&&This is hilarious, thanks &&Who looks more Taylor kitsch than Taylor kitsch right now.

&&I actually really like Dylan O'Brien but he's not leading man for me? Maybe if he got a better role. I just think he shines when he isn't being asked to play the everyman character. &&First movie was alright, but I found the second one to be total garbage. &&I like Dylan O'Brien though.&&Maze Runner movies hold their own pretty well. Haven't met a person that didn't enjoy them. Way better response than Divergent bleh'&&Clear eyes, full hearts..?&&uhh what was billy bugging me about all day? oh yeah that Atlantic Rim movie. back in my day our giant robots would talk and shoot death lasers out their eyes.

why is there no one in the this blockbuster?&&My buddy's girlfriend's grandmother legitimately bought him [2012: Doomsday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132130/) for Christmas when it was new.

I believe Scott Eastwood is his co-pilot.&&He directed the last episode of Daredevil, season one, which was pretty damn well done.

I was shaking in my seat and tears of joy were in my eyes. Ugh, such a great film. &&No, that was my last worthwhile boner. All others hence have been underwhelming. &&China doesn't care about the environment&&But like, why have massive robots with the plasma cannons when you can just set up massive turrets by the breach to blast rising kaiju to pieces.

Maggie, Amelia, and then Thatchers other family in that one episode.&&Why not? For all the shit that happens to/at that hospital a 3rd half sister is the most plausible curveball on the show.

What's so bad about it? Genuinely curious.&&I watched American Assassin with my girlfriend and knew Taylor Kitsch was supposed to be a star in it. I didn't realize until she told me afterwards he wasn't the main character.&&He plays a fantastic everyman character in the early seasons of Teen Wolf though.&&This crowd is weirdly against Steven DeKnight for no real good reason...

*""We've achieved drift compatibility.""*&&did you just bleep hecking?&&Continue to read if you want that scene get ruined:


The Jaeger hand and monster's face was a lot harder than those hollow container.

The way the heads screw on and insert before pilot synch was also very Eva entry plug-esque. &&Yes! It's a love song to so many great movies and shows!&&[deleted]&&Good thing they didnt fuck it up like Big-O Season 2.&&And the sword had literally just been installed, and the people piloting the Jaeger were a dude who hadn't in years, and his partner who never had before.&&Wow I never realized that they actually thought this through to this level of detail. That's amazing. &&Also I thought it was a new upgrade that Raleigh didn't know about? But since he's drifting with Mako, he should've known...&&In Transformers, I remember just seeing a lot of dust and smoke to cover some of it up&&Yup. It's the. Main reason many of the early game of thrones epic fights were at night.

&&[deleted]&&[curse those lemon stealing whores](#spoiler)&&I completely agree. The hug was friendship/comraderie, not a love story. Could there be attraction or tension between them? Sure, but does it actually become a plot point? Nope.  They talk about numerous times how close simply being linked up make the two pilots, so when one nearly dies after an essential suicide mission, it could have been Schwarzenegger and The mountain on the screen and they still should have/would have hugged it out.&&Some people ship Mako Mori and Raleigh Becket because there is some tension between them in the film.

edit: also, this line that Raleigh says to Mako (while they're staring into eachothers' eyes): ""You know, Mako, all those years I spent living in the past... ...I never really thought about the future. Until now. I never did have very good timing.""&&Originality is not the only measure of quality. Superior execution can be just as good. &&Same, and for FF movies as well.

Not for the plot or anything, but for the jaw-dropping CGI, especially the last big battle. &&It's sometimes weird how that shit plays out. Sometimes casting directors or even directors themselves will just see someone and be like ""Yep, we're gonna push him."" Sam Worthington isn't the only example at all. He'd also done some large enough Australian films.&&I watched the trailer for that movie and thought ""oh, Taylor Kitsch, havent seen him in a while"" then suddenly Taylor Kitsch shows up and I realize that the main dude is another actor &&literally the only reason to maybe watch that show past the first few episodes&&I don't think it's that they're against DeKnight, it's that they're against Not-Del-Toro.&&They actually are starting to.

Duna dun duna dunnnnn&&*orgasms uncontrollably as a single tear rolls down face*&&I think it's less about the added hardness and more about the added weight. I don't know how much a Jaeger's hand weighs, but even an empty shipping container is another  4tons of metal to throw around. Fully loaded they can weigh 71,650lbs(32,500kg). Gipsy Danger was holding 2 in one hand and 3 in the other. At least a few of them were loaded. So if we assume they were all at capacity that's potentially another 358,000lbs(162,500kg) behind those punches. So more like a boxer loading their gloves with car batteries than a dude with a loaf of bread.

Also why space TV shows can actually do a lot with a small effects budget (relatively) since well, space is dark.&&
Seriously though, I appreciate the effort you put into pulling those qoutes. Deepened my respect for the movie because it was treated like a proper film that was about mech fights rather than just a vehicle for CGI action. 

Unseriously though, how dare you bismirch the honor of weaselly ways to engage in rhetoric! What rhetorical device allows people to unprompted responses from fools while also serving as a segue into the answer I want people to arrive at among other things? Is the the rhetorical question truly fake or merely atypical? Is it really a fake question if is being used to implant an interrogative in another rather than voice the speaker's curiousity? /S

The first few monsters, very scary everyones terrified.  But they learn how to beat them, then it becomes a cultural sensation.  TV shows, action figures etc.  I could honestly see a whole movie just on that and still be entertained (like a prequel).

Kind of what I was hoping Colossus would be but it went a different route.

The biggest thing that pissed me off was that transformers apparently have a long history with humans, aiding us during virtually every major event in our history, including Bumblebee assisting allied troops in ~~WWI~~ WWII (to be honest, they probably participated in WWI too, because why the fuck not?). But in the first movie, they learned English through the internet, fell to earth for what was supposedly the first fucking time, and the government's reaction was ""Holy shit! More giant robots!"".&&Oh my god. What happened?  I mean 1 was ok, 2 kind of sucked. 3 was ok. I actually kind of really like 4 just because it seemed better with Wahlberg in the lead, but 5, WHAT. THE. FUCK. HAPPENED?  It was awful. And not just Transformer awful, but it sucked every fucking minute awful.&&Nah they turned into a 3 headed dragon which we also barely even saw.&&Thinking back on it, much of the movie is buildup: blackout shows up, frenzy shows up, bumblebee shows up, the autoboys show up, megatron is a popsicle, decepticucks show up, megatron melts, everyone fights. None of the transformers actually die until the last quarter of the movie (scorponok doesn't count). The entire sequence between the dam scene and the big battle is dedicated to building tension. 

This movie actually had a fair bit of restraint, for Michael Bay.&&Jablonsky had a great role in making [Arrival to Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H0JDomv8ac) amazing&&Charlie Day&&How so?&&*Messenger bursts into the chamber in rags, sweating from running in the wasteland for days*

""b a d b o y e s did us a h*ckin bamboozle""&&this could a good TV spinoff series. a smaller human scale drama on peoples that are trying to figure out how life should continue in the age of Kaiju.&&Dude, I can go on and on about the plot holes from this series. 

When Sentinel brought Cybertron to Earth, why didn't Quintessa show up? And why didn't those spires come out of Unicron when it happened?
Quintessa never bothered to take the Matrix of Leadership from Optimus, even though it has infinite power. 
Sentinel for some reason refused to take it as well. 
Cybertron destroyed Earth's moon but that somehow didn't affect the Earth at all.
Why does Megatron ask for the release of his decepticons (only for them to die within 5 minutes)? Why the hell did the humans accept the deal?
Why did Quintessa send Optimus alone to get the staff in the ocean? How did they even know it was in there?
How did Bumblebee's voice fix itself?
How did the Knights bind Merlin's staff to his descendants?
Why did the Knights try to hide Quintessa staff on UNICRON. Cybertron's greatest enemy. 
Lockdown said that he captured every Knight except Optimus but it turns out there are thirteen of them in the bottom of the ocean that he never knew about. 
Why did Quintessa send Lockdown alone to collect the Knights?
Where was Quintessa during the Cybertronian war between Optimus and Megatron?
Why didn't she send anyone after the Allspark?
The Fallen might've actually been the good guy for trying to destroy Unicron. 
Why did the other Primes choose Sam to obtain the matrix? And how? They all died. 
How do the Dinobots know what dinosaurs looked like? Weren't they created after Quintessa blew up Earth and caused their extinction?
And if the Quintessants were on Earth all those years ago, why didn't they destroy Unicron then?

I can go on but this is giving me a headache&&Wasn't that the plot of literally every movie?

""We've seen them before trapped in ice and on Mars""

""They were actually here during the building of the pyramids""

""They were actually here on the moon""

""They were actually here during the prehistoric age""

""They were actually here during medieval times, and all throughout history since""&&I really hated 4. Most of the plot is basically a rehash of 3 except in China beacuse China gives us money, and literally *everybody* was a total cunt. Even Bumblebee and Optimus!&&Bayhem&&",2017-09-26 13:55:20

[Translated article.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.cc/news/2017-09-14/cowboy-bebop-shinichiro-watanabe-directs-blade-runner-anime-short/.121376)

>Director Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo) is directing an animated short tie-in to the Blade Runner 2049 film, which opens in Japan on October 27. The short is titled ""Blade Runner Black Out 2022.""

>The anime will take place in the year 2022, between the original Blade Runner film, which takes place in 2019, and its sequel Blade Runner 2049. The story will involve a large power outage on the west coast of the United States.

>Watanabe is writing the script in addition to directing. Cygames Pictures, the anime studio subsidiary smartphone game publisher Cygames established last year, is producing the animation. Shukou Murase (Halo Legends, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing) is serving as character designer and animation director, and Flying Lotus is composing the music.

>The cast includes Kenichirou Matsuda as Iggy, Ichigo Aoba as Trixie, and Makoto Furukawa as Ren.&&Mother of god, it is the perfect combination. &&""Director of Cowboy Bebop making a Blade Runner anime""  

Be still, my beating heart.&&Sooo not asking if everyone is jerking off, I'm more curious of how hard you are jerking off right now... if I had a foreskin ... it would be dust.&&I just rewatched Blade Runner last night and I really noticed how much influence it's had on classic scifi anime, such as Ghost in the Shell or Akira. The use of beamed lighting, neon, etc. and even the overarching existential themes are all so very similar.&&After *Arrival* and *Sicario* Denis Villeneuve has my unwavering faith. And now putting the director of arguably one of the best anime's of all time at the helm of creating a story bridging the gap between the two films?  


Okay...3, 2, 1 let's jam!&&✅ Sci-Fi

✅ Bounty hunter main character

BEBOP SEASON 2 CONFIRMED BABY&&Just went from 6 to midnight...&&Confession time -- I've never seen Cowboy Bebop.  I barely even know what its about.  That's about to change starting tonight though.&&[Some behind the scenes of the anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwjGlAa3-F4)&&https://i.imgur.com/EAb7VXy.jpg&&This is going to be great!&&Hell yes! Bebob, Dandy, and Champloo are my top 3 anime of all time. I'm honestly not much of a fan of the genre but I swear anything this man works on turns to gold. I thought Kids on the Slope was pretty good for what it was, and that's my least favorite of his work.&&It's the Animatrix all over again!&&I don't think I've ever read through a thread with more mentions about hardons, masturbations and dicks. &&That's cool.

When similiar things have been done in the past (Aeon Flux's Peter Chung did A riddick short, or the Animatrix comes to mind) they turned out pretty cool.&&I love when they do this. The Animatrix and Gotham Knight were great. &&I know Harrison Ford has always had a gruff public persona, but lately he gives the vibe that he would be in a good place for some voice work.  You still get most of the star treatment at his level, but the whole thing is less of a fuss.  Also, you still get to practice the actor's craft and have fun bringing a pretend character to life, but the physical demands are extremely gentle.  As long as the project is well-funded, we could hear one voice for all of Deckard's incarnations.&&Good...good...&&Thanks for letting me know /u/SLUT_MUFFIN&&I'm actually incredibly excited for this. I feel like 2049 is going to be a cluster fuck. Based on the trailers it just seems like the most facile approach you could take to a sequel (replicants are slaves—better free them!). 

Watanabe has a great track record in my opinion. Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror, and Space Dandy were all good while at the same time being pretty different.  &&Time to watch Cowboy Bebop. &&I don't want something covering the gap. Just do a story set in the universe. Could even be completely different characters. I feel like trying to tie it to two different movies will heavily restrict Watanabes creative control over how the story plays out.&&I just woke up from a 20-year coma, what's new?&&Oddly I don't give a toss about Blade Runner outside of Rutger Hauer however I would hump rusty barb wire for more Bebop.&&*Picks up and reattaches jaw that just fell off and hit the floor...*&&This can only end well.&&I'm more excited for this than the actual film.&&Still not interested in 2049, but *this* has me intrigued.&&This could be very very good&&My nerd senses are tingling.&&Prediction: this will be better than the live action film. &&that sounds so much better than the actual sequel. get hype!&&SO like the Animatrix for those Matrix films? niice
&&Cowboy Bebop stands out as one of the greatest amines ever to me. Blade Runner is also a very classic film. Fingers
 crossed this goes well.&&I'm glad that WB is investing in creating a franchise out of this universe. More interesting than King Arthur, for sure.&&Welp,time to start furiously masturbating...
Seriously tho... Watanabe...blade runner... Flying lotus...
Three things in a sentence I thought I'd never say in a million years...&&Please be good. &&Oh fuck yes. &&Can... Can we just get that Keanu Reeves Bebop movie already? Please?&&They're really going full matrix reloaded with this and I'm worried.&&I am definitely tempted to jump on this.  As a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop, I gotta say that Watanabe's name behind anything is a huge sell for me.  The man is a great genius and truly knows how much a soundtrack means to a show.  Cowboy Bebop is just his prime example, if anyone liked that, check out Samurai Champloo, or even check out Space Dandy for his more comedic side.  I have yet to see it and he didn't write it, but he directed ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" which I've heard a lot of praise for and is more of a drama, as far as I know, if action isn't one's taste.&&""I like the kind of android who can kick my ass""&&There isn't a single part of this statement that I didn't bust to.&&Perfect. &&Beautiful. I cannot wait. &&Slightly unrelated, but I think it would be interesting if they managed to reference or tie into PWSA's Soldier in some way for 2049. It would be super dorky and awesome as long as it isn't too excessive.&&Which raises the question, if there was enough material, why didn't they make a movie during this time period and save 2049 for a sequel?&&wtf? life made.&&Why can't he just direct more Cowboy Bebop? &&神聖なたわごと!!&&Oh baby, oh yeah!&&Holy fuck&&This will end up better than the movie.&&I usually consider directors overrated but blade runner is an exception.  Every scene in that move takes a light source and does something amazing with it.&&Heh, this sounds exciting. If 2049 ends up being bad, maybe this won't. Will it come out before 2049 though? I can't read Japanese articles...&&I'm much more hopeful and excited for this than the new film&&Holy fuck. This is too good to be true. &&I did not know that I wanted this&&It's Shinichirō Watanabe. That's all I need to know.  &&Looks like I have to get super into Blade Runner now&&OMG YES. Cowboy bebop the only anime I actually enjoyed and I hate anime.&&*Furiously masturbates without lube*&&as a 32yr old man, ya I'll watch that&&YOKO KANNO PLS&&Fuuuuuuuck yes.&&Holy fucking shit, is this real life??&&Wow. Best news I've heard in months. &&Omg omg omg omg. This... This is amazing... I... I don't know how to react. &&Yes! Yes! Yaaaassss!

Now I can pretend Blade Runner and Cowboy Bebop (Samurai Champloo and Space Dandy with some time travel shenanigans) somehow overlap :D&&TIL: Shinichiro Watanabe was co-director on Macross Plus! No wonder it's one of my favorites. 

Also, Space Dandy was the shit!&&YASSSSS&&HHHHNNNNGGGGG YES&&Holy shit boys we're in the best timeline.  
Get hyped!&&Gimme some more fuggin Bebop too.&&Holy shit yes! &&i am cumming&&It seems like a weird match tonally speaking, but Watanabe's works fit in that Tech-Noir/Cyberpunk genre.&&Now we just need the director of Champloo to make something badass and 2017 will come out okay. &&Is it a series or a movie? Either way I'm fuckin stoked man. I was not expecting this at all.&&AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH&&This is life&&It should have hip hop just like in Edo period.&&What fucking timeline is this? &&oh shit hell fucking yes.&&Wait wait wait.

And flylo is doing the music?

I'm so erect right now I don't even have excess skin to blink with&&HOLY SHIT&&This... this could be REALLY GOOD.

I hope the writing is up to par.&&Haven't seen Space Dandy, but I absolutely loved Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Terror in Resonance.

Definitely looking forward to this.&&Fuck yes!!!!&&I'd watch it. &&u/internetcaffine, there's something you need to see...&&Oh God yes! &&Here's a video going us a tease. 

[Concept art](https://youtu.be/pwjGlAa3-F4)&&I had to read this twice because I thought it was a joke. 
  
Holy shit, this will be *amazing*. 2017 is a good year after all. &&this sounds incredible&&YES YES YES YES YES PLEASE &&yessSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&&Bruh holy shit, this should be great&&Is Deckard not in this then? Because I was under the impression that Ford did not like animation. Or was that just for Star Wars? &&Yes!&&I think it IS time to blow this scene...&&What a time to be alive.&&Whoa, amazing news. Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are both incredibly well done animes&&Holyfuckingshityespleaseimsoexcitedrightnow!&&Oh my fucking god!&&*Boner grows* Bladerunner.... Anime? *breathes heavy* PUHlease let it be episodic. &&HOLY SHIT! Cowboy Bebop is not just my favorite anime but my favorite tv show ever! I can't wait!&&Yassss!!!!! &&I can get behind this..&&I just vomited but this news is making me feel better. Never watched anime, so this'll be my intro. Can't wait for 2049.&&Not sure, but they are several short that will come out from different director selected by Denis Villeneuve that will cover the gap between the two blade runner.

Exhilarating.&&I didn't know I needed this.&&hell fucking yeah&&seriously, three of my favorite things. it doesn't seem real &&THERES A FUCKING FLYING LOTUS SOUNDTRACK?! WHAT.&&I'm more excited for this than the sequel coming out to be honest. Cowboy Bebop was freaking amazing !&&Well that just made my year. Watanabe's use of music is fantastic. I can't wait to see (and hear) this!

I might like it more than the feature film...&&*Nuts extremely hard*&&I like Flying Lotus but honestly I don't want this to be some cool hip sci-fi anime with a hiphop soundtrack like Samurai Champloo or something. I'd rather it be more slow and serious like Akira.&&Flying Lotus on the fucking soundtrack? This is the greatest news holy fucking shit &&This timeline isn't so bad after all.&&I just fainted a little.&&I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles once. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.&&God works in mysterious ways.&&This is why I don't get hype for shit anymore. I've been hurt too many times. &&Cowboy Bebop already holds that title&&That's how I felt before Twin Peaks Season 3, and it met my expectations.&&Yes. God... yes.

I already had Mario Odyssey, Wolfenstein and Stranger Things on that day and then here comes another one.&&Flying Lotus and Watanabe together in a blade runner project? 

Mind. Fucking. Blown. This is the most perfect thing ever. &&Niceeee! Flying lotus doing the music should be interesting!&&This is actually Cygames Pictures' first work. Bahamut was animated by MAPPA.&&Ahh a short film? 

Don't get me wrong I'm still pumped. Just wish it was less... short.&&I finished watching Bebop for like the 5th time a couple weeks ago (shoutout to Samurai Champloo, I love you Mugen), *and* I just recently found a sweet Flying Lotus mix ([this one](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tMQKRwTdr_U)) *AND* I think the new Blade Runner looks decent.. at least as far as reboot sequels go.. so uh, yeah, gonna have to agree with you on that one. &&Yeah all I can think of is : omfg&&That's what we said about Del Toro, Kojima and Norman Reedus.

And it would have been.&&I had a foreskin 40 minutes ago

That's also a great film directed by Villeneuve.&&I've just finished the Ender series of books. I should really watch Arrival again. &&you're so lucky. I would pay to have my brain wiped so I could watch this anime in all its glory from the beginning as a fresh experience.

Try FLCL too.&&Fucking do it. I just watched the movie with my friend last Tuesday. It's all so good.&&Get ready to binge watch this muthafucker!&&The netflix sound is fucked (at least in the UK it is, don't know about US). Hopefully somebody has a DVD you can borrow. Also, most people recommend the english dub. It's a fine example of it done well.&&I don't even like anime and I've watched Cowboy Bebop in it's entirety 3 or 4 times. &&It's not a genre, but a medium.&&this. growing up bebop was the first real anime i watched and got into, still one of my top 5 all time.&&Is Space Dandy really that good? I've heard a lot of great reviews but it just didn't stick with me the first time I watched an episode. I've seen the first couple that aired, does it get markedly better or do I just have bad taste...&&Watanabe's segments were my favorite Animatrix bits, so I'm extra pumped about this. &&Some of my favorites&&He personally hates voice work. Says his most hated scenes in the original blade runner was all the narration he would do. Once you realize how much he dislikes it, and re-listen to his voice work, you can hear how unenthusiastic he is.&&As long as he doesn't fly that plane of his.&&As if I've needed such a a flimsy enough excuse as a ""reason"" to watch Bebop.&&He does what he wants and I doubt this will be an exception. Sometimes it's hard for him to keep investors on board, because they're fed up of having no control over him and don't understand his working process. If you want something to be done unique and enjoying, Watanabe is your man. But don't expect him to care much about your opinion as he works. I doubt they would work with him, if they didn't want his take on the universe.&&I'm excited for the sequel, but I'm worried they're taking all the cyberpunk out of it, based on the previews.&&Me fan too :)&&Because Harrison Ford is too old?&&Why would he? Bebop had a perfect ending and doing varied works is better than focusing on your greatest hit until it's no that great anymore. Besides, IIRC Bebop wasn't particularly successful commercially, especially in Japan.&&The story is done.&&Bebop ended wonderfully.  Why can't you just leave it be?  Spike is dead, having tied up all the loose ends of his past.  Fae remembers who she is, and Jet will continue bounty hunting, albeit with a stronger purpose.  Finally, Ed has gone on to greener pastures, having found the family she's always wanted.  What more do you need?&&why&&Should I tell him? I'm gonna tell him. 

(*this is the same guy*)&&It's a short film&&Space Dandy is just silly fun. I recommend it.&&I really hope this starts a trend of anime adaptations of science fiction and fantasy novels. Back in '99, before Id heard any rumor of a Lord of the Rings movie, I had just finished the books and I was just getting into anime and really wished that they would make an anime adaptation of Lord of the Rings. Boy was I pleased when I saw the trailer for the movie though. I felt like it was made just for me. &&WHY WAS THAT DETAIL NOT IN THE TITLE???&&As a non-fan, you guys hyping Flying Lotus on the level of Watanabe makes me curious... what's the best place to start listening?&&Also expect Thundercat to be in the soundtrack as well. The two go hand in hand perfectly. &&Such an amazing experience watching Cowboy Bebop. I still listen to the OST every once in a while. If you haven't seen it yet, his next series was set in feudal japan, and it's equally amazing. Samurai Champloo. &&If you liked Cowboy Bebop I'd recommend watching his other two shows that follow the same type of episodic format. Samurai Champloo is more action oriented but still retains that Watanabe coolness and Space Dandy is way more comedy focused, but it can get really heavy and interesting with is far sci-fi concepts at times.&&You made me spit out my coffee you glorious bastard :D&&but...but...Nujabes....&&I was hoping for Yoko Kanno again. :(&&Have you heard flylo's work ? It's not all hiphop and i wouldnt even call his hiphop stuff classic hiphop, it's a mix between so many genres&&Flylo seems like the perfect guy for this imo. I dunno if you have looked at his latest albums but he is definitely not just some hip hop producer any more.

The guy has so much musical talent that he defies genre, not to mention he posted on his facebook about how he was obsessing over the original blade runner before he was set to work on this so I imagine he'll give it the treatment it deserves.&&I'm not really fussed about it being on brand, just happy to see a take on the material from talent I love.&&And you don't trust Flying Lotus to excel in subtlety when it's needed and coolness when it's deserved?&&> some cool hip sci-fi anime

So, everything Watanabe does?

Ever actually see Bebop, Champloo, or Space Dandy? 

That's kinda his thing, broh. It's why we love him.

(Also, ALL of those shows have their slow-paced and serious moments as well. It's not like you aren't allowed to do both)&&Would have loved to have seen them reform The Seatbelts for this.

A Cowboy Bebop style sound track word work really well.&&FlyLo is more than just hip-hop though so I wouldn't be concerned, the dude doesn't stick to one genre &&Yeah, Timecop would be better &&Do not fucking doubt Shinichirō Watanabe.&&There are certain things I won't get hyped for, one of the most recent things being Netflix take on Death Note. When I first heard Netflix would be doing Death Note, I thought it would be done as a series, but i wasn't going to get excited, because I figured they'd fuck it up...and they did more than I ever thought they would in fucking it up.

But there are certain things that I can hear about, and have 100% complete faith in that I would bet my life on it. This is one of them.&&Maybe stop hyping for things to be lifechanging, incredible experiences. Just a bit of hype is fine.

If your hype is sky high every time of course you're going to be disappointed.&&[removed]&&Watanabe is consistently excellent though. And Flying Lotus is consistently excellent. As for Blade Runner-- the first movie was fantastic, the new movie looks promising AF, and if Watanabe has creative control enough to make it 'his', it will fantastic.

(Disclaimer: on the other hand if it's Hollywood just wanting to have an 'Japanese/Asian/*Oriental* take' on one of their properties, it'll probably be somewhere between luke warm and shit.

(scooted the time back two seconds)
&&Incendies is so good&&Eyebrows&&While I love Bebop and Gurren Lagann, I didn't like FLCL. I think FLCL is one of those things that's best appreciated around the time you're still in school, and by the time I got around to seeing it I was in my mid-twenties. Part of the problem could have been that it was overhyped, but I don't think that explains all of it considering how I liked the previous two I mentioned and those two are also hyped to hell and back.&&Watch the movie last. Watch the whole sites first!&&*Space Dandy* is my *Cowboy Bebop*. I always only hear everybody raving about *Cowboy Bebop* when Watanabe comes up, and while I think it is good, *Space Dandy* is one of my all-time favourite anime! &&You just have bad taste.

That's what my ex-wife called me....""&&It's one of those things that everyone and their mother told me I'd love and it's turned me off it. This is just the flimsy excuse I did need! &&I'm worried about them making it a ""the whole world will be changed after this"" storyline.

I like it and I want more.&&More of that universe! It doesn't matter if it's this specific crew, could be one of their competing bounty hunters, or a ""prequel"" showing more of the world before the events of Bebop - what brought Jet and Spike together, for example?

I was a huge fan of him when he was coming into the forefront of the LA ""beat"" scene, [his Los Angeles LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDO1ksMixzE) is a great atmospheric, pulsating alien spaceship ride. [His Cosmogramma LP is probably his best work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urT_lrk369o) (IMO) and is a ""space jazz opera"", in his own words. 

[If you're into simpler beats a la J Dilla/Madlib/Chiptunes I'd start with his project 1983.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY9wzoJvqYs) 

Flying Lotus is the spiritual successor to J Dilla/Madlib and pretty much made the entire ""weird beats"" scene explode back in 2010 or so. Many underground musicians in hip hop and electronic owe a lot to him. Don't go into these works with any expectations and just try to take them for what they are. &&Check out: Massage Situation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oUx6wGCekM

....and a ton more amazing tracks. His albums are good full listens.&&Unpopular opinion but ""You're Dead!"" Is my favorite&&If you liked the music from Samurai Champloo, you'll love it. He's like the spiritual successor to Nujabes and J Dilla &&I'm a little late to the party but this is my personal favorite and how I was first introduced to FlyLo: [Kendrick Lamar - Wesley's Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX0CLLiVAnw) It was the intro to what many consider, especially myself, to be one of the best hip hop albums of the last 15+ years.

To my knowledge he was the main producer because Sounwave, one of Kendrick's main producers since 2009, is also listed in the credits as well.&&Best intro music ever also! The bass line gives me goosebumps! &&Space Dandy was wonderful too. The guy can do no wrong.&&RIP nujabes&&Nujabes and Fat Jon gave me my favourite anime sound track of all time (OF ALL TIME!) on Samurai Champloo.&&Cowboy Bebop vs samurai champloo:

Two guys and a girl (and Edward) set in a different time (the future) in a dangerous line of work (bounty hunters) with kick-ass music. Directed by Watanabe.

Two guys and a girl set in a different time (the past) in a dangerous line of work (Ronin samurai) with kick-ass music. Directed by Watanabe.

If you love one, you will love the other.&&Didn't know Champloo and Bebop had the same director. I guess it makes sense since they are my two favorites! He is the best at building characters and relationships. I don't know how much credit he gets for the soundtracks but they are the best ones I'm aware of too. RIP Nujabes&&Holy shit, he did Champloo? No wonder I liked that one too. &&Yup, stop everything you are doing and go watch Samurai Champloo. It's amazing.&&I've only found Samurai Champloo with subtitles, is there a dubbed version like cowboy bebop? &&I wonder why dandy is always mentioned over terror in resonance?

It's still too soon to talk about it. &&He died for our sins&&RIP &&Cowboy Bebop soundtrack (full 7CD) is always on my phone&&The true answer.&&Yoko kanno did fantastic work in Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex&&Agreed! More of an experimental genre. I think it will be very interesting.&&Everything he has made has been great, fact.&&Seriously. Cowboy Bebop is great but Knocking On Heaven's Door is a motherfucking work of art. Such a fantastic film.&&Do keep in mind that his hands are tied regarding the story, it has to run from the end of Blade Runner to the start of 2049. Therefore there will be certain features within the story he must include even if they are stupid and out of his control.&&Sadly I get hyped every time I hear about an adaptation because Death Note is perfect for it. In it's original form, the concept is great, and there's some incredible moments, but there's also a lot of flawed elements that could be fixed in a remake.

Just an extra ""episode"" in the middle of the beginning/end. &&At least make Mugen and Jin proud, and perform seppuku!&&Watanabe actually directed 2 shorts in The Animatrix, ""Kid's Story"" and ""A Detective Story"", the latter reminds me of Cowboy Bebop.&&it's interesting how The Animatrix was better than either of the two sequels (even if I still adore the action scenes in the second one)&&As is Batman: Gotham Knight&&Oh man I love the Animatrix, watched that several times over the years &&there are 2, and a Hobbit movie&&Samwise the Strong and Down down to Goblintown were unreal.

Spike and Mugen have the same VA, too.
&&He did, but there were also other directors involved. Also, Terror In Resonance is more akin to Kids on the Slope (plus imo terror in resonance is probably the worst anime he's ever created).&&Because Terror in Resonance ended up being quite bad according to many people, including me.&&> He actually directed the latter. He didn't even direct Dandy did he?

For Space Dandy, Watanabe is credited as Director, not just episode director, though Shingo Natsume is also credited for both.

Space Dandy is mentioned because it's not the horrible mess that ""Terror"" is.&&And don't forget our boy Fat Jon!&&I.. I must have been living under a rock.. what.. what did I miss?&&Space dandy is hit or miss. Samurai Champlo and Cowboy Bebop are two of my favorites of all time, though. &&Even his coming of age drama 'Kids on the Slope' was amazing. Best rendition of 'My Favorite Things' came from that short series.&&Ahem, Zankyou no Terror&&I couldn't get into Terror in Resonance, honestly.&&Did you see Terror in Resonance?&&You obviously didn't see Zankyou no Terror... Although it did have its moments&&And to think the Netflix version left out the potato chip. How are we supposed to let that slide? I mean, in a laundry list of sins, it's only one, but still. &&Yes, MAKE IT A LIVE ACTION SERIES not a movie.&&The new adaption is a white dude and a black dude, so no j-rock mullets. Just a butchering of plot, theme and characters. &&...Ryuk was in no way what was wrong with it, Willem Dafoe did excellent work, and they honestly could've just inserted him without makeup and he'd have worked fine.&&Who wouldn't come with a 12"" Ryan Gosling?&&Nothing, probably.

If you're like me, then you couldn't get into Neon Genesis because you weren't super familiar with anime itself.  As far as I can tell, from reviews that I've read, the show was a subversion of the tropes common in anime.  So if you aren't very familiar with anime then a lot of the show seems to go unappreciated.

It also doesn't help that the Christian motifs/imagery exist simply to be ""cool"" which doesn't really help a Westerner's attempt to locate concrete themes.  Someone else feel free to correct me but I honestly couldn't figure out why it was there in the first place.  I know some critics say that the intermingling of the various religious imagery makes it become something... more, but I just can't see it.

Bebop is just way more accessible.  I enjoyed the ever-living shit out of Bebop because it's a lot more universal.&&Nothing. It could be anything, you not liking Mecha anime, you not enjoying the voice actors, you not liking the animation, you not liking the story, you not liking the characters. Not liking something or not being able to get into it is perfectly fine, sometimes a story just doesn't suck you in like it does other people, and that is okay. It happens all the time with things like books, TV shows, anime, comics, manga, and even people. If you aren't feeling interest towards it then don't push yourself to do it, that will almost always lead to a growing disdain and maybe even hatred for it.&&Nothing at all. It's one of those shows that you seem to either love or hate. 

I personally think it's hot garbage, but it has a pretty huge cult following so clearly a lot of people see something in it that I just don't. &&It didn't try to be deep, it is deep. It is an excellent introspection and analysis of depression in particular, and psychology in general. There are some symbolic red herrings, such as the religious imagery which is just a backdrop to evoke mystery, but the primary thematic exploration is all about the mind and human relationships. 

Because of this it isn't super accessible, and typically takes multiple viewings, an understanding of anime as an art form/medium, and a lot of discussion with other people who have seen it. It's one of the few anime that I would describe as truly literary in depth and scope when you really start digging into it. That's why despite the fact that it is 22 years old, you will still find ongoing debates and discussion about it on anime forums and discussion boards across the internet. No other show has elicited so much analysis, discussion, and debate for so long, which is indicative of its status as a masterpiece of the medium&&I was just mentioning who he was, not whether he was a no name or not&&Here you are:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJYH9aGEEGg&&https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BLADE+RUNNER+2049+prequel&&It was pretty experimental, giving every episode director full control over the artstyle and plot of each episode. This created some really great highs and some lows. But overall Space Dandy was a pretty Dandy experience. Each episode was like opening a present you never knew what was coming for you.&&Easier to get in frat parties now woooooo!&&I thought I had a father...but I can't remember him anymore. &&I think the masturbatory services directed at Cowboy Bebop and any of Watanabe's work is well warranted.&&It wasn't that I wasn't following anything, I'm used to following insane troll logic, it's just that none of the characters really appealed to me. I'm not going to claim I understood it in its entirety, I just didn't enjoy it.&&Yeah anything along those lines. Give me like four episodes of some lil adventure. It'd be tight.&&Yes Sempai!&&I thought Detective Story was the most interesting one, and it's got the noir feel.  So between that and Bebop, I bet this guy can make a cool Blade Runner movie. &&Detective Story is the one that looked like Gilliam's ""Brazil"", right?  That was cool&&I wished they had done more short stories for what happened after the sequels instead of that mmo &&What? They never made Matrix sequels. ^^^^^\S&&My favourite short story was the first one&&Oh yea I always forget about Gotham Knight, despite owning it and liking it :P &&There are 3. Hobbit and Return of the King in the same style/studio and ""The lord of the rings"" which coveres part way into ttt from fotr.&&Goddamn [pimp af.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogTDa-vG2MQ)&&Yeah Ralph Bakshi did it. He has done several projects with a similar unique animation style. &&I sung it when I was a line cook at a large chain resturant.&&Idk how they'd do a movie of that series though, I've listened to the first two and they just don't seem like something that would break down into a screenplay well. All the story happens in the reflections and all the main events do is prompt those reflections.&&The artist for the first round of them, Jae Lee is amazing.  He's got such a unique style! &&Graphic novel would suit it much more than a movie imo. 

Disclaimer: Haven't seen the film, don't plan to. &&The dark tower comic books are awesome and fill in a lot of the story gaps&&Trigun's pretty damn good.&&well except for dying young. &&Yes, my son. Let the weeb flow through you. Kekeke&&Just watch Champloo dude. If you like it you can call yourself a fan of Watanabe's work so you won't feel like such a weeb.&&And its OST, God.

All praise Yoko Kanno.&&Kids on the Slope was so good.&&Space Dandy was a fun ride but left me wanting more from the characters. But i guess you have Bebop for that. &&I love the hell out of that show. It was never boring and always tried something different from episode to episode. The animation in some of those episodes blew my balls off.&&His death ? &&And don't forget Kids on the Slope! For me definitely not the same level but it is a subject matter that I particularly like(being a drummer myself).&&*gasp* How dare you! Space Dandy was awesome! &&Space Dandy was a hit and a hit and I will keep hitting it again. 

I loved Bebop, Champloo, and KOTS&&Space Dandy was created by Watanabe but it is a collaboration project where almost every episode has a different director. That's why even the art style varies wildly from episode to episode. Every episode is something totally new and I thought that was pretty sweet. &&I made this mistake of having my first 
3 start to finish anime binges be Champloo bebop and hunterxhunter....

Unfortunately after that you realize that you will never watch anything as good &&Space Dandy is fucking glorious.&&Space Dandy is hit or miss but some of the hits are among the best episodes of any from bebop or champloo imo.&&I definitely did not like Space Dandy at first because I was expecting it to be like Cowboy bebop in a way. Having re watched it a couple times I grew to appreciate and enjoy it.&&I personally feel Space Dandy was cut from a different cloth—it felt more like an animation/director/musician showcase using the same characters as a base than anything.

I fucking loved it though. &&Holy didn't realize he did Samurai Champloo too. Now I'm even more excited. Nujabes soundtrack is gonna be hard to top but Flying Lotus is really fucking good. I'm stoked&&Found the guy who doesn't like booty.

&&And Lullaby of Birdland too imo. The duet scene at the school is SO damn good.&&Man, it started out so good too. &&The first few episodes was amazing! Then, that white haired girl appeared...&&It had two of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in anime. Tell what you want about the story after the white haired girl showed up, but it was artistically amazing. Hands down best OST I've ever heard as well.&&My friend had a clubfoot, I used to put a buncha thumbtacks in it.&& 12"" Rachel McAdams.&&Why are you turning this into an Evangelion diss thread? Yeah, the guy who was putting down Cowboy Bebop sucks, but that's no reason to go after the thing he likes. Can't we just agree that they're both landmarks of Japanese animation instead of turning this into some kind of debate?&&I can't verify this myself, but I do recall the creator being incredibly depressed because his two previous projects before Evangelion were utter failures. So during his slump, he wrote Evangelion and probably inserted religious imagery when he felt he was betrayed by the world around him (once again, cannot confirm right now). &&Which tropes are we talking about here? I'm just a casual consumer of anime. Would like to know if there are any pre-requisite anime I should watch before tackling​ NGE.&&Thank you kind sir&&Wow, I've never even made that connection. And Brazil is one of my favorite movies. &&Ugh, for real. Fuck The Matrix Online.&&Right? If they give us a Netflix anthology series ""Tales from the Matrix"", I'll pretend like the sequels AND Cloud Atlas don't exist.&&no, like i said, there are 2 lord of the rings movies (The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi & Return of the King by Rankin/Bass) and 1 Hobbit movie (The Hobbit by Rankin/Bass)&&There are 4. Thusly I spake, and thusly it is so.&&Holy flashbacks to memories I forgot I had... That song kicks ass. I kinda want to do a remix of that now myself.&&Ideally a decent film of it would be a sequel. &&Never should've been a movie. Absolutely better suited to a Game of Thrones-style TV show. They'd need to really commit though, especially with budget I imagine &&Too real, man... Too real.&&I dunno, it seems to be in vogue with musicians. &&Oh... I've been a fan for ages, but I didn't know..
:c&&I wasn't as invested in the show overall, but the jam session scenes were so good. &&Kids On the Slope's soundtrack was amazing, and the story was still pretty damn good. I'm a sucker for tragic stories though. That's coming from someone who never watches slice of life type anime. Thoroughly enjoyed it.&&Yesssssss I love Sakamichi no Apollon, Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop! This is gonna be the best! Pls be the best <3&&Don't forget Macross Plus.&&I actually like Kids on the Slope more than CBB 0_0&&If you liked Space Dandy, check out Redline. It's balls to the walls insane, in the best possible way.&&I'd say there are quite a few anime that can stand up to cowboy bebop, but none of them will ever ""feel"" as great since they didn't pop your anime cherry.&&if you liked hxh you should check out yu yu hakusho if you haven't already.

The movie trilogy is all on Netflix now def worth the watch!&&*Space Dandy is hit or hit&&The first episode is one of the best episodes of any anime I've seen. Haven't seen Bebop yet though.&&In a way, it's funnier because of the way it kind of parodies/makes fun of cowboy bebop. Like, instead of Spike, this lonely tortured soul bounty hunter roaming the galaxy, who's just a romantic at heart trying to escape his past, you have Dandy, who tries so hard to be cool that everyone ends up thinking he's lame as hell, and he just goes around inadvertently fucking shit up and making an ass of himself. And of course boobies. I did like the way both of them seemed to build up to something bigger though.&&yer kidding&&You know it was until the out of control Engrish and the Chess Airport puzzle that makes me wonder if Japan actually knows Western Chess rules. Though nothing will ever surpass Code Geass' Checkmate with a King. Even Shogi don't allow that. &&That's not a diss.  Neither is the guy that said he just couldn't get into it.

To disagree isn't necessarily to diss.&&I don't think it was a diss as much as it was an explanation as to why it seems to be that despite both being arguably the same level of popularity among anime watchers Bebop is almost always going to be above it on the lists of *first* great animes where as Neon Genesis is going to usually going to rival it in a list of great animes. 

They are right in the fact that Bebop is an all around easier watch, but it is also more trouped and and easier to predict. Spike gets a bounty, Spike chases bounty, Spike catches a bad case of the empathy, Spike tries to help someone out despite it meaning the bounty will get away or he could die, Spike goes back to the Bebop hungry and broke. A few episodes break this cycle but it is largely a reoccurring track for the show. That being said it is not necessarily a bad thing that the show has a formula, the way it is executed is very well done, the comedy isn't your normal brand of overly expressive stuff that you see in other animes like One Piece or FMA, the music meshes perfectly with the scenes (also makes good driving music), and despite the formula the ride from point A to point B is always enjoyable.&&nah im pretty sure they've said they added the imagery just because they think it looks cool. and for the japanese audience the foreign christian crosses and shit looked dope (which they kinda do imo)&&Anno's previous work actual was quite successful. He didn't become depressed due to failure, at least not real failure. His depression partially stemmed from his own perceived failures, but it was mostly because he is simply a man prone to major depression. He frequently goes through extended periods of depression, most recently after the release of the most recent Rebuild movie, Evangelion 3.0. &&It's been awhile.  And since I only watched only around half of the series so I could be wrong. 

But some of the tropes subverted were things like ""The Chosen Hero who can handle everything ever and is super awesome"" or ""All the women in our Protag's life fall over themselves throwing their tits at him"".  Others like bloodless gundam fights are turned into pretty fucking brutal brawls with serious consequences.  IIRC the MC suffered things like PTSD; his mentor had a serious daddy issue with the MC's dad - shit like that.

I guess just consume some popular, blandish anime from the 90's, stuff like Gundam which, while good, is pretty damn generic?  I dunno, I'm not even a casual consumer of the medium.  I've watched a few things like Jin-Roh (which is extremely excellent) and Bebop but can claim only a passing knowledge.

I just sometimes watch critiques done by people who are well-invested in anime.  If you don't mind spoilers I'm sure some critiques on NGE can better guide you.&&I read there was also a common trope that missing fathers would suddenly reappear in the hero's life with a big robot/destiny for his son, and the son is unnaturally ok with it. So evangelion was like ""Dude, what kind of father does that? And is the kid really ok?""&&**Edit** I was thinking of Enter the Matrix, sorry... Surprisingly never tried Matrix Online...

I loved that shit. Being chased across rooftops by agents? Check. Prompt hacking? Check. Story ties into movies and have the same actors? Check. Expanding the universe? Check. Bullet time? Check. Lesbian kissing scene? Check. At the time I adored the movies and could easily ignore the problems it had.&&Woah Ima need you to settle down now. &&My grandma has the hobbitt movie! She loves fantasy and got me into it. I watched that all the time when I was a kid &&Fun fact: after the demise of the studio, the top animators from Rankin/Bass actually went to form Studio Ghibli with Hayo Miyazaki. So, in a way, it's like the Rankin/Bass adaptations are anime adaptations. In a way.&&Im pretty sure there are actually 9. One for each of the fellowship.&&Car crashes, not so much.  Dude should still be with us, but he not through no fault of his own. &&Yeah unfortunately he passed in 2010. It's a real shame, he was an amazing musician. &&For sure an unpopular opinion but I respect that. The theme is completely different, to each its own :)&&Oh I watched that last year. It was awesome! Soundtrack for Redline was fun to listen to. &&My anime cherry was popped by domon kasshu and his shining finger.&&My anime cherry was popped by original Dragon Ball in Chinese&&I was into Inuyasha and Full Metal before anything else. That was like 13 years ago. Just now watching Bebop and it's fantastic.&&And has a sudden  unexpected that's it? ending to boot! &&Yuyu Hakusho is actually technically the first anime i watched (outside of Yugioh on saturday mornings) I loved that shit.


Younger Toguro 2020&&Outlaw Star never gets enough love.&&FMAB is god tier but I had already saw it while it was airing lol, I didnt ""binge"" it&&While not the epic that is Cowboy, I always found Big O to be great, especially with Steven Blum as the main character.&&> Neon Genesis Evangelion,

That's rude. They still haven't even finished the remakes or whatever the hell they were. Don't ruin this persons life by recommending that.

Everything else is amazingly solid. &&Utena, Penguindrum, Ping Pong the Animation (and everything by Yuasa), Cardcaptor Sakura (no, really), FLCL, Ashita no Joe (and everything by Dezaki), Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Macross, Patlabor. && Berserk is an amazing manga that has a shitty anime carried by the source material. That goes for the 90s anime as well, that was crap too. It's just that the new Berserk runs are just so much worse. 

I recommend to anyone considering watching Berserk to ignore all anime runs and just read it. The story is insane and some of the artwork is unforgettable. 

... though if you can stomach the soul wrenching story and get caught up with the manga then prepare yourself for Miura's infamous writing hiatuses. The guy is about as slow as George R.R. Martin, except he feeds you scraps at a time instead of helpings&&*Space Dandy is hit or hit, baby.&&Do yourself a favour and watch it, I haven't seen an anime with as much style and just coolness. It just oozes oodles of it &&I believe it's canonically the same universe as Bebop? Though that might just be a fan theory because they both use woolongs, I can't recall.&&I found it kind of forgettable. It was good, but it didn't really stick with me. &&I was talking about the guy who was trying to say Evangelion was better, not the guy who said he didn't understand it.&&Yep, pretty much the usual mecha tropes.

Then again, Gundam has been going on for so long, the franchise has been subverting itself for a few times.&&>his mentor had a serious daddy issue with the MC's dad

If you are referring to Misato, Gendo Ikari was one of the few men she didn't really have daddy issues about. Her issues stemmed from the fact that she resented her father, whom was mostly absent from her life, making her feel unloved and unwanted, which clashed with his final act which was to sacrifice his own life to ensure her survival during 2nd Impact. The two characters that she projects these issues on are Kaiji and Shinji. &&Nah brah, Enter the Matrix was my jam, and frankly necessary to fully understand the bloated, pretentious plotline of the sequels.&&Hacking the game to unlock cheat codes was super neat too!&&Given an infinite number of parallel universes, there must be a universe composed entirely of VHS copies of the Hobbit cartoon.&&Right? They use this same super rhythmic almost heartbeat like beat behind all the races that gets you pumped.&&That's a wonderful sentence and don't ever change it.&&It's rerunning on toonami if you need to reacquaint!&&Your life hasn't truly started until you jump down the Evangelion rabbit hole. It definitely shouldn't be a person's first series, but there's a reason why I always list it first when I talk about great anime.&&You've got some good taste, my friend. &&*Space Dandy is the booty, baby&&I am trying to watch Bebop right now, and I just can't stay hooked. It's hard for me to follow when all the episodes feel like disjointed one-offs.&&I believe one of the episodes has the fridge from Bebop lying in a junkyard, with the same monster inside. But that could just be a reference for fun.&&Ah gotcha.&&yeah back then The Wachowskis were really on the top of their game, even if the third movie was especially disappointing (I watched it and went ""Not like this."")&&Unfortunately, I don't have a TV.&&It ended kind of weird but I feel Eureka 7 is a good pseudo-Evangelion. Similar feeling to the bizarre world. &&It's an episodic show, there is an over arching theme of the characters but you can more or less watch each episode without having watched any previous episodes. If you want to get into the meat of the action watch episode 1 then 5. If you don't enjoy watching episode 5 then it might not be the right show for you&&",2017-09-14 19:34:29
Dave Bautista Wrestles With Becoming a Nuanced Character Actor with the Body of a ‘Fucking Gorilla’,35752,6xdwfi,http://www.indiewire.com/2017/08/dave-bautista-character-actor-wrestler-guardians-of-the-galaxy-blade-runner-2049-bushwick-1201871542/,2985,1504264990.0,,"As a WWE fan that watched his run from 2002-2010, it is awesome seeing Batista ascend the ""bigger than WWE"" ladder so quickly. Despite what some say, he was an amazing wrestler and really played the role as one of the main guys well. It was unfortunate to see him leave, but to see him become such a bigger star with each passing gig is great. Can't wait for his epic fight scene with Ryan Gosling in BR 2049 &&His girlfriend worked at the same mall I worked at years ago when he was coming up. He used to come in and hang out before picking her up at the end of her shift. Super nice guy and also the biggest human I've ever seen in person.&&[deleted]&&I feel like Dave Bautista is a really humble and genuine guy. &&I feel like he gets to show off a fairly sensitive and emotional side as drax. I hope he gets more of the roles he wants. I think he's easily the most talented wrestler turned actor of all time.&&""Wrestles with.."" Man, the title is just digging it in, isn't it?&&He is a super sweet guy! He was being surrounded outside my job when my shift ended. I stood there for a while seeing if I'd be able to take a pic with him. Anyways after a while of him taking pics I see that the people he was with (im guessing security?) was telling him he had to leave already and he then told them that I had been waiting for a while and after my picture he would leave and I was shocked because I didn't even know he was aware I was even there --- so ever since then I was like wow about him &&He was absolutely my favorite part of Guardians of the Galaxy 2&&/r/swoleacceptance &&He just needs to team up with Peter Dinklage for a gritty crime drama&&Yesterday I learned that Dave Bautista is 6'6'' tall. He is fucking *massive*, and must look like a wall IRL. I found it surprising because Drax is always framed to look shorter than Quill, even compact.

**EDIT:** Turns out his height is a lie, and part from his wrestling days when athletes would exaggerate their features. Thanks to /u/776shark for the clarification.&&I think his worst character so far was in Spectre, where he was just muscle. The train fight scene was awesome but why did they give him a different gimmick every scene and allow him too say one word?&&If only there was a franchise of movies based around a planet of some kind of primate...&&It's a bit comforting to hear that stars like him can get self-concious. That dude is pretty famous and has achieved a lot in his young career. Yet, he feel self coscious. I am happy he is going opposite direction than Rock. &&Whatever he wrestles with, it's going to lose.&&When I first saw Batista I thought oh great another wrestler turned actor. After seeing him in a few roles I realized that this guy is really talented. I could definitely see him as an Oscar winner/nominee if he was put in the correct role. I hope he finds that role because he really is good and with the right management could pull off a stellar acting career.&&Someday he'll be considered an Actor/Wrestler, and NOT the other way around. &&Here's hoping he gets a really well written script for Eternal Warrior. &&Casting Agent: Hey Dave I know you want to be a serious actor n stuff that's great and all but you should audition for DRAX THE DESTROYER. 

Dave: *sighs*&&At least it's working. He already has more range than The Rock, and The Rock has been in feature films dating back to 2001 in The Mummy Returns. 

Bautista stars in one of the most successful franchises ever in Guardians of The Galaxy with a lot of comedy, is a lead in a rather serious film in Bushwick, and has a role in action/drama Blade Runner 2049. He's working with different directors in different genres and developing range, which is nice to see. &&As a person who saw him in house shows when he was going by *Leviathan* it blew me away when he appeared in GotG and was actually great in it.

One of my favorite Batista moments was when for the first time ever (imo) a WWE storyline involved actual subtlety. When Batista was in Evolution there were small examples where the stable would do evil stuff and Batista seemed bothered by it. It kept building and building until one show he suddenly made a face turn on them. (when they decided to start building him up to hold the championship belt)&&It's unfortunate he cringes at some of his GOTG performance, I thought he was great. &&He should have been jack reacher&&He might be able to do the same as successful directors do. Ask for a two movie package. Agree to the big screen one if you can do the film you really want too. Might even be able to fund a smaller movie with guardians money and sell it to Netflix, Amazon, etc.

Hope he gets his chances to try different roles.&&I feel for the guy. Being type cast sucks and it actually only pushes more stereotypes. 

I think this is why I like Dwayne Johnson's roles (mostly). He doesn't always play the big tough guy. His character in that Kevin Hart flick was actually really good.&&It shouldn't be that surprising that pro wrestlers transition well to acting. They are essentially live stage actors who also need to remember choreography as well as their lines. &&>     Zoe Saldana, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”

That's a still from the first film, not the second.&&Reminds me of Noel Gugliemi.  
  
Playing characters named:   
Hector 6 times.  
Angel 4 times.  
José 4 times.  
Frank 3 times.  
Chino 2 times.  
Paco 2 times.  
Raul 2 times.&&Why do so many pro wrestlers turn out to be such awesome people? &&Poor Dave. It's not his fault he was born with a chiseled, Godlike body.&&I'm embarrassed to admit that I only know of Dave from his role in the first Guardians movie. I had a great deal of difficulty figuring out whether his wooden line delivery was because of his acting talent or the way he perceived the character to be. But given the comments in this thread, I much more interested in seeing what else he's capable of now.&&I honestly believe he is capable of giving a good performance in spite of his physique. There just needs to be a role for him that subverts the expectation that he'll be the strongman archetype. Vin Disel did an exceptional job in *A Man Apart*, in my opinion, and it wasn't a completely typical role from what he normally played around that time.

I hadn't realized he was going to be in the new Bladerunner, so I do hope that he has a moment to show off his acting chops before being a bruiser (based on what I saw in the trailer).&&Batista's heel run before he left for acting was amazing. The whole ""Gimme my spotlight!"" thing was great. He finally got his charisma out...and then he leaves to go do movies.

Then he comes back on a 2 year deal but quits out of frustration just before GotG comes out and the WWE misses out on the massive publicity they could have had by having him in the company.&&He was never the most gifted guy in-ring but still ended up having a real solid backlog of matches to his name. Especially with Undertaker, imo. His real strength was always his charisma, even if it wasn't the kind of charisma people expect from a top-level wrestler.

BASKETBALLS DON'T HOLD GRUDGES.&&I never really followed wrestling but my best friend did and I always said Batista was my favorite based on the rare few matches I watched, I just liked the dude, couldn't really give a good reason why. But I like to think I just foresaw greatness. When I found out he was cast as Drax I was excited but figured it would be like a stoic muscle man role, I was shocked to find out that he has great comedy chops. I hope he continues to expand his roles.&&I just saw Blade Runner at Alamo Drafthouse last night. It was my first time. It was the ""final cut"" in 4K with remastered sound. The movie was absolutely gorgeous, and the world was just amazingly well realized. I can't wait for BR 2049. I didn't know Bautista was going to be in it. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors.&&The Welsh Strongest Man got married to a girl that lived in the same village as me, and a load of other strong men came to the wedding.

Holy fucking _shit_ they were some big people. Magnús Ver Magnússon is basically three people crammed into one suit. &&Dude some wrestlers are just so fucking massive it blows my mind. My neighbors are from Tonga (small ass island) every year they have a huge pig roast and their extended family comes, pro football players, wrestlers, and just regular people from the island. Holy fuck it makes you feel like a child seeing the immensity of some of those guys. They're all so happy and welcoming those parties are a blast.

Edit: I am from MN, I have replied with that like 5 times plz stop ;[[[[&&My buddy was a waiter at a diner some years back. Bautista came in for dinner at said diner. Took up the entire side of the booth meant to fit three people by himeself.&&[deleted]&&He was a chaperone for all of my middle school field trips. His daughter sat next to me in Spanish and has a sex tape floating around now I believe.&&[""With a face like this, there aren't a lot of lawyers or priest roles coming my way. I've gotta face that was meant for a mug shot and that's what I've been doing for the past thirty years.

There's a brazilian actress that got casted as a house maid over 15 times in her career. She's black and has a ""stereotypical"" face. 

Some people called it racism, others said that actors work with their looks and skills to get certain jobs. Although I don't really have an opinion on the subject, I do imagine it would get stale after a while, doing the same role repeatedly.&&I think you could look at The Rock as an example of pivoting away from action star with voice work like in Moana. I loved both of these guys when they were in the ring, Dave is talented and deserves a fair shot. &&Gears of War needs to happen and he NEEDS to play Marcus&&[deleted]&&It's... Just. *Boris!*&&[deleted]&&Try being Danny Trejo &&He really looks like a down-to-earth guy in his interviews. This is a new step in his career and he said he's trying hard to get better as an actor. It really makes you want to root for him. 

Guardians was really great exposure for him and helped him get new roles. I'm excited every time I see a new trailer and Bautista shows up on it.&&He broke down in tears when he was cast in Guardians of the Galaxy and immediately took acting lessons and worked on his role.&&He is. Dude was shy as well and worked as  a bouncer before wrestling. Even in wrestling he joined much later than people usually do and did well.  Listen to the Talk is Jericho podcast with him if you're interested because both Batista and Y2J are interesting people to listen to. &&There is a huge difference between playing Draxx and playing a character that people take seriously. People might have a lot of trouble getting over the fact that he looks like he could pull out your spine. That being said, if he can pull it off I am more than happy to see in more movies and more diverse roles. &&I'm telling The Rock you said that and ur gonna be sorry there bud&&[deleted]&&Pretty much made for Reddit cheap pun squads. &&Same. The scene where he is sitting on the steps talking to Mantis about his daughter was so good.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEkkrrEZQ10&&He was very good indeed, but for me he was second to the gold people.&&""HAHAHA I have famously huge turds!""

Best line in the while movie.&&Ow my nipples!!! 

Yeah he stole the movie for me. &&He did have all the best lines, tbh.

Presumably because Gunn thought, ""fuck, this guy's good"", and gave them to him.&&Hands down. When mantis hit her head and he says ""mantis look out!"" super late I was dying.&&I laughed so hard at his recurring 'harbulary batteries' line. I normally don't go for that kind of humor, but his delivery is so solid that I was in stitches. &&Wheymen, brother.&&Praise Brodin. &&Or a remake of ""Twins""&&Honestly, as a concept, that sounds pretty great.&&He's not 6'6 that's from wrestling where they lie about their height. Just google pics of him and Chris Pratt together who's 6'2. Chris is the same height if not taller.

I'd really like it if that footage were ever released. I really had no problem with him being just muscle since it was a real throwback to older Bond types, but it would be interesting to see the character differently.&&I thought he was great in Spectre! Sure, not much of a stretch as an actor, but he is the best Bond henchman of recent years. &&The first ever Bond muscle-henchman guy was a character played by Robert Shaw in ""From Russia with Love"" (second movie).  His character was an assassin trained by Spectre to run interference on Bond's mission.  He hardly speaks, but that just adds to the mystique/intensity of the character.  They have a final showdown in a fight on a train (sound familiar to Bautista's role?).  

Trains/train fights, in general, are a recurring thing in Bond movies (part of the Bond META, if you will).  Bautista, in what may have seemed like a limited role, actually fit the Bond mold/meta perfectly... And hey, Robert Shaw went on to do alright in the movie business.&&Apes with emotions ???? Are we crazy ??? An ape can't act ! :P &&The Rock is the character actor that Dave did not become, and I'm happy about that.&&What direction did the Rock go?&&Wrestle with Jeff, prepare for death &&Sure, but let's get one for Tom Hardy first, alright?&&The Wrestler Pt. 2?&&I don't think talent is the real separator. 

It's motive. 

Dave wants to be a real actor and do real roles and do them well. 

Most wrestler actors want to be Hollywood rich. &&I didn't know he was a wrestler prior to guardians, just thought he was some hilarious manbeast that landed a good role. Did some research. Good for him, he has some serious talent and, while Drax doesn't lend itself well to sensitivity and seriousness, there were some hints of depth in the character that Bautista pulled off very well. Look forward to seeing a lot more from him. &&Oscar winner?  Slooow down my dude.  &&I want to take all of these comments and just email them to Bautista. I think he'd probably really appreciate all of the positive praise that he's getting.&&Truly a man deserving of a Slashie.&&I don't know, the Rock is still... well,the Rock.&&At the same time, though, drax develops. Yes, there is a large amount of comedy around him, but he is also a nuanced character, and I honestly would have no one else than Bautista playing him. &&HE CRINGES AT HIS DEEPEST MOST EMBARRASING SCENES, DO ME DO ME&&I read that as him cringing over his memories of how he was feeling at the time those scenes were filmed, rather than at the quality of his performance. But it may be that he's still self conscious about his acting abilities.&&Yes.

I'd love to see him in some similar role, a role where the solo protagonist kicks ass like John Wick or the Transporter. &&Vin Diesel does this as well.&&Because they started out as awesome people. &&Any research into the history of pro wrestling and you'll find so many guys and I mean top level guys with a vast array of character flaws. Murderers, adulterers, wife beaters, alcoholics, pedophiles, etc. wrestling is a very difficult business to make a career of at the top level and finish without it ruining you. Batista, Cena, and Rock are three of the success stories. There are so many more that just get swept under the rug following their run ins with the law or worse did not survive their 30s or 40s due to the very hard living. &&Former WWE Helpdesk person (company did overnight and weekend support when their desktop group wasn't in)

Pretty much universally 'the talent' as they referred to them were humble and awesome people to work with.  These were the folks, as an IT engineer, you loved talking with.  

""I dont know how to do the thing, but you just walk me through it and I'll do that"" No balking, no questioning, no trying to tell me their life story on a computer which has fuck all to do with the actual problem.  

That said, you learned quickly that some of the talent were not so much playing characters as just 'always at an 11' all hours of the day. See also - Dusty Rhodes.  That man could screw up a blackberry by looking at it sideways, but he was funny as fuck about it.  &&It's a filter bias.  It's hard to get taken seriously as a pro wrestler. If they are not amazing, down to earth, charismatic guys, they can't break out of the wrestling game. That's why the rock, Cena, and Bautista are the ones you know of outside of wrestling, the rest are stuck in the WWE&&His delivery is definitely part of the character in the GotG movies.  Drax has no understanding of subtlety or how to properly convey emotions.&&I agree with you. Vin was also good in Saving Private Ryan and Boiler Room. Vin and Bautista both have range, they just need the right role with good dialogue at the right time. &&Dang I remember that. I remember he did an interview where WWE doubted him and the movie. 


> I haven’t talked to a lot of people about this, and I don’t care if they’re pissed for me saying something - but I wanted to come back and do SummerSlam because... I would have had the opportunity to go back and I talked to Steph and Hunter about it and I think that was... around August, I wanted to come back around the release of the film, around Guardians, and I said wouldn’t it be great if I was back, and I was also in the #1 movie in the world? 
And they kind of had a snicker and it was, you know, “We don’t even know if the movie’s gonna be good.” 
And it was one of those moments and I was like okay. And it was a very uncomfortable moment where they were just kind of doubting me and laughing in my face.

[This one](https://www.cagesideseats.com/2015/11/2/9658166/batista-the-rock-helped-him-deal-with-difficult-wwe-how-come-back). Where he discusses about how he didn't want to come back as a babyface for the Royal Rumble 2014 but they forced it and then were all surprised that it didn't work.

It's not in either article but CM Punk said, in his tell-all with Colt Cobana, that Dave signed a full 2 year deal that was supposed to go from 2014 to 2016. He wouldn't be a part timer like Lesnar, he was going to do a full schedule like everyone else.&&They did the same thing with the rock when he went to Hollywood after his 2nd heel run - they let his contract expire without talking to him thinking he'd fail miserably in Hollywood and come crawling back and they sign him for less money.

It's a big reason rock wanted nothing to do with wwe between 2004 and 2011&&That's hilarious considering the caliber of movie the WWE usually puts out with Stone Cold, Cena, etc and all of the other 'action man!' movies.

When you're the most popular actor on the biggest TV show in the world, these casting things are less of a problem.&&Even though it probably wasn't intentional, I thought casting a short person in DoFP added something to the role.

I thought it added some depth to the character.&&No which was really good because even though it was unspoken it added a lot to the film.

Bautista's agent was telling him ""We can try to make you an action star"" and he said ""I don't want to be an action star, I want to play different characters."" 

Pretty much every action star just plays ""themself"" with various backstories.  Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Vin Diesel, The Rock., all have distinct personalities, but their personality is more or less the same in every action movie they appeared in, just with a new backstory and tweaks. 


&&> Every movie The Rock is in he just plays some version of himself.

He's a pretty [diverse actor.](http://i.imgur.com/aROQGGC.jpg) &&The good thing for the Rock is that people love him as himself. &&Actually in his case, he couldn't get cast at all because of his fame as Luke. &&Let's not forget that he even voiced Wolverine in the early 2000s, and did arguably as good of a job as Jackman and Blum.

Absolutely not. That man has a family. No concern for the human body.&&At the same time, I'm not about to start taking The Rock as seriously as I did Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile. The Rock hasn't marketed himself that way. 

I think it's early enough in Bautista's career that he can decide where to place himself. We know that he has what it takes to play the meathead kind of character, but it's up to him to prove otherwise at this point. &&SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH &&You may have anosmia. Consult your doctor.&&I'd have to see more, but you could be right. And I'm a fan of The Rock. But he's more a charisma machine than a character actor. Which is by no means a slight, and takes a lot of work as well.
The broad facets of acting really are a lot more complex than they appear on the surface. It's one of the few things I loved about The Revenant: both DiCaprio and Hardy put in some of the best performances of the year, but in completely different ways. DiCaprio goes all in on ""I'm going to sell the reality of what's happening to my character"" and Hardy goes all in on ""I'm going to sell the reality of my character actually existing as a person"". Both are very challenging to pull off well.&&You are part of the problem man ;_;&&Agree completely. While I think Drax is probably the funniest character in the series with his deadpan humor (Nothing goes over my head, my reflexes are too fast), he does have a lot of emotional depth to explore. I hope Vol. 3 involves his daughter, Moondragon, in some capacity. Also with Infinity War/Avengers 4 coming up, I really hope Drax gets to play a big role in Thanos' defeat, with Vol. 3 dealing with the aftermath.&&I like to think he jokes a ton in this movie because he learned about humor from quill. So he's using it to try and fit in with his new friend group. And he uses it as a front so he doesn't have to talk about his family tragedy with anyone.

The way he told her that she wasn't his type, I always kind of figured he was gay.&&There's a movie starring Dinklage coming out and I legitimately forgot that he was a dwarf until like halfway through the trailer. I just saw Dinklage and my mind went straight to, ""Hey, it's an actor I like!""&&[deleted]&&Varys is still around, but he seems to be completely forgotten at this point, which is a shame, I loved him and littlefinger going back and forth. &&Is he though?  He's definitely a skilled diplomat and very good at court intrigue, but this season has shown that when the gloves are off his strategic advice is pretty terrible.&&He wasn't much of a player this past season, a lot of missteps and bad choices.&&My SO made me watch it and I kinda expected it to be terrible so I got a nice surprise when it was actually quite good.&&There was the other ~~midget~~ Dwarf actor who did an AMA that basically said if it wasn't for the ~~midget~~ Dwarf roles, he likely wouldn't get any roles. If a role calls for a ~~midget~~ Dwarf, generally only ~~midgets~~ Dwarf can play them ([LoL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukRdEVthmWM)), so he was happy to be cast for all those roles.

EDIT: [AMA question and answer, which I seemed to have overplayed a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4q2j36/iama_actor_and_a_person_of_short_stature_and_no/d4poi1z/)

EDIT2: I am 6'4"" and used to work with a lady (in her 50's) who was 5'0"" or 5'1"" and I nick-named her ""Midget"", to her amusement. She used to call me a giant. It was all in fun and I never realized it was an upsetting word. Sorry to all that were offended. &&I really loved him in *Knights of Badassdom* (a better movie than it has any right to be). It released after GoT, but went through a long post-production hell phase, so I think he may have been cast *before* anyone knew that GoT was going to be such a powerhouse career moment. Once again, it's a role where his size is just there, and it's not commented upon. He's just a bro that loves shrooms and LARPs.&&There was absolutely no reason that Bolivar Trask had to or should have been portrayed as a dwarf. He's not a dwarf in the comics either.

But they chose to cast Dinklage for him anyways and it was a fantastic choice. Even without your unspoken comparison, he just played the character very well.&&You can't ever deny or put aside the baggage of what you are, if you're anything other than a white man, in the arts. But there are times when you can make that unspoken baggage work in your benefit.

I had a discussion with a well-respected theatre director about ""Legally Blonde,"" which boiled down to the question of whether you can have a black Elle Woods. He said yes, and I said no, because too much of the story's concerns would look like cruel satire if Elle were nonwhite. 

She is repeatedly discriminated against or underestimated because of her appearance; her boyfriend dumps her so that her appearance won't reflect poorly on her political aspirations; her only refuge is the local hair salon. All these tropes reflect very differently on a black girl than a bubbly white girl, and the elephant in the room would be ""it's not because you're a sorority girl, it's because of institutional racism."" 

Emmet Forrest, on the other hand, is a character for whom that baggage of blackness adds greater nuance. Born poor, supporting his family, hustling harder than everyone else his whole life to get to where he is and STILL being underestimated? It's a fantastic role for a person of color, which lends more nuance and poignance instead of underlining the themes a little too boldly as a black Elle would.&&That's XXX-Men&&nigga that's like saying *you* can't be homeless, just go for a walk &&His home is literally 75% of the earths surface&&Fuck, now you've got me dreaming. &&Holy shit.

I always feel bad though cuz no one is ever there buying these type of actors autographs or pictures, probably because they want like 30 bucks for each, you'd think if they only charged 10 people would be paying it just for the fuck of it like ""hah check it out I got a pic with that dude who got his shit pushed in"", and they'd make way more than they do but they wanna charge 30 and maybe sell a hand full throughout the day. I'm sure it's an ego thing like ""oh I'm worth more than 10 bucks"" but personally I'd feel way dumber sitting at an empty booth all day getting recognized but no one wanting an autograph or picture cuz it's too expensive.&&Final Fantasy has cholo guys?&&She's 60?!?&&she does have resting maid face&&Link isn't loading the pictures. &&He is a trash panda&&Rice Cube?

...


/s&&Yeah, they'd rather make Jared Leto, Russel crowe or Charlize Theron pack on 25 or 50 lbs for a major studio picture&&And I appreciate that about him. He was always one of my favorites in the WWE and I enjoy the direction his career is headed. I was afraid he would end up doing nothing but playing muscled up bad guys but when I saw him in the first GotG as Drax I thought, ""damn, this guy is going to do some good things if he keeps this up.""  

It was unfortunate that his dialog got cut from Spectre but I can't wait to see him in Blade Runner.&&Even when they were all together in the Expendables&&Schwarzenegger was actually able to move beyond action movies and into comedies though (Twins, Kindergarden Cop, Jingle All the Way, etc). But he was a much bigger star than Stallone, Vin Diesel, Jason Statham, et al. and he could sell anything. &&And a gay bodyguard in Be Cool.&&> Pain & Gain

That movie is so much better than it has any right to be.&&Also in Central Intelligence. (Good movie btw)&&He killed it in ~~Get Shorty~~ Be Cool. He has fantastic comedic talent and timing. Plus his roles in The Other Guys, Pain and Gain, and Southland Tales shows he can do dramatic and very silly. He has range, but he is playing it safe nowadays to make money. When he gets bored and wants a challenge he will get with a talented director and put out something amazing, you just wait. &&Wow, look how skinny he was!&&Don't forget Central Intelligence!&&Vin Diesel is also [a very diverse and talented actor.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Pacifier_poster.jpg)&&[deleted]&&His best work though has to be when he was the Cock-knocker. &&Who would have thought it would pay off for him 30+ years later?

Another great casting choice - he's perfect as that laconic, laid-back badass type.&&Not enough story to pull you in first&&HE'S BROKEN IN HALF! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! &&The Rock is going the way Bautista is saying he doesn't want to. The Rock is just fun. Bautista wants to act&&Yeah, I still have loads of respect for Dwayne Johnson. He has clearly been working hard on his craft, is an immensely talented and athletic person, and I genuinely enjoy most of what he has been doing. It seems that in the last 5 or so years he's learned where he fits and is making the most of that. Bautista, imo, has the opportunity to do the same thing. It just seems that he wants to be more of an actor than an entertainer. I wish him the best of luck. &&It seems like he's already made a very conscious choice to not go down the same path as the Rock, though. The Rock did leading roles in cheap action movies from the very start. Bautista has done several ""meathead"" type roles, but there's more nuance there, and it's apparent that he has made the effort to not just be another wrestler-turned-action-movie-leading-man.&&and know your damn role&&Ah I felt the same way about The Revenant. I thought Leo was great utilizing what he had in that role. It was a very physical performance and he really went all in on it, but to me, he was more symbolic, of resolve and determination, than an actual character. Tom Hardy just KILLED it as Fitzgerald though, he created this unrepentant asshole out only for himself, yet really made all his actions, no matter how despicable, totally believable. &&Stupid question from someone that is not into comics, but has watched all the movies...

What is Drax's power supposed to be? I've heard people say that he's basically 'built' to destroy Thanos, but he doesn't seem much... more than just a really strong man, and he struggled with the Vol1 villain&&""You suck Zylack!""

&&This sounds very homoerotic&&Same... one time I managed to get a fully locked in rear naked choke because I tripped him (samoan friend) and they typically don't fall too gracefully especially when drunk.

I as like well fuck that was my best shot I guess we're never wrestling again lol.

YOU NEVER SHUT UP

I SAID YOU TALK TO MUCH!

OH BOY YOU NEVER SHUT UP!&&Braun corpsing? SEND FOR THE MAN&&Not powerlifter - FUCKING STRONGMAN. &&Most Tongans I've met have just been pretty stocky or downright fat. Don't get me wrong, they're probably the toughest people on this planet (see: Meng/Haku), but I think you might be overstating their stature. Having met Braun Strowman, the guy is fucking massive.&&Mark Henry?&&To be fair, Andre was a literal giant.&&Most people go through life not really meeting many people that are anywhere near this big in person. Some can afford visiting pro sports ( basketball)  and then actually meet them in person - maybe. Even then, there aren't as many that are 7 footers as people think. 

I've only met two people in person that were around this size and it's.... a little surreal honestly. I was a reasonably tall 6'3"" and my peak (started shrinking sadly; stupid aging), and the first time I met someone this tall was a friend of my dad's when I was in college. He was 6'11"". Shaking his hands was like instantly being teleported back in time to being 7 and meeting an adult and you had to shake their hand. I felt awkward and weird cause his hands were basically baseball mits. I followed him to another room and fell in step behind him and I was looking at the middle of his back. When you are used to looking over most people's heads it is a little weird. 

The second time was my 15 year high school reunion. Some girl in our class married a giant. Seriously. This guy was 7'4"". And not an athletic tall either. He was overweight and built like a normal fat dad, but you know... the size of a mountain. I went to greet him and realized he was sitting and I was basically looking him almost in the eye. When he talked it sounded like boulders  tumbling off a cliff. It was just an undulating bass with no discernable inflection for words. I felt bad but I literally understood nothing he said. 

I always wanted to be tall when I was a kid, and though I had hoped for 6'4"" and I got pretty close, I know now that being super tall and big like that is not necessarily a great life. Joints and organs often fail at a much higher rate and I suspect many people this size find much in everyday life that just wasn't made for their size. I've had to get off one roller coaster because my legs from hip to knee were literally too long for the enclosure to close the lap bar and I'm in the ""normal tall"" range. I can fit on a bed, in a car, and in a shower, and my hands can hold a phone and dial buttons (though they are tiny for me). I could only imagine those guys going through life were these types of things were daily frustrations.&&The one gambling in the church? So if he plays a priest, he's playing a crooked priest.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&While Tyrion is a ""full character"" in the sense that he gets a characters arc, development, etc, Varys is more of a ""plot character."" He exists more to serve the plot. In the early seasons, he was there to enhance the sense of intrigue and subterfuge in King's Landing—a mysterious character, with unknown goals, with hundreds of spies at his disposal. Most people wanted to know about Varys's motivations not because of the character per se, but to unravel the mysteries of the plot.

Notice that in the entire show, the only character-centric scene involving Varys was when he talks a bit about his origin and we see he has the old sorcerer in a box. Beyond that, Varys serves the plot and the theme of intrigue in the series.

But as the series goes on, it becomes less about intrigue. Furthermore, eventually the show has to tie loose ends, and by now the mystery behind Varys's motivations has been (seemingly) solved. With the character serving little function to the plot and theme now, he fades into the background.&&Perhaps Varys is the younger, fairer queen that Maggie the Frog alluded to?&&That's a result of bad writing though. They needed Dany to get bamboozled, so suddenly all of her advisors and agents were ineffective to the point of being out of character. Why wasn't Tyrion sending Ravens to try and get allies? Apparently the Darrys, Redwynes, and Graftons were loyalists, why didn't he reach out to them? Why weren't bribes being made to sailors and dockmasters to report on the movement of the Greyjoy fleet? Varys has agents all over Westeros, but apparently Qyburn giving sweets to some orphans dismantled his entire network.

The writers needed conflict so they wrote the competent characters to be stupid.&&And if the season finale is anything to go by, [Tyrion still has a soft spot for his family, as shown by him still wanting to be reasonable with Cersei, us not getting to see how they finished their conversation and his suspicious behaviour when seeing Jon walking into Dany's room](#spoiler). Not exactly the mark of a fully pragmatic, ruthless strategic advisor. Tywin Lannister he's not.

Which is fine, because I think it makes him more complex and human&&I thought it was a neat casting. His grudge against mutants and their genetic anomalies is heightened by the fact that as a dwarf, he also got a genetic anomaly, but with no superpowers. &&Ron Perlman was in it for like 15 minutes and he was cool.

Its a movie about a barbarian that fights people.  What, you expect Citizen Kane?&&The biggest problem with the film was simply that it was entirely forgettable.

Ftfy.
 &&Doesn't everybody?&&They did a great job casting, Arya shot up like a beanpole right as her character needed to be taken seriously.  At one point I remember her walking in a lower section of road to make her look a little smaller against the Hound next to her because it was right at the point where she makes her big character turn obvious and the impact that she's all grown up was really pronounced when they did it, so that scene was probably an intentional attempt to make her look smaller right before.&&Which made him feel angry and cheated. So he takes out his anger mutants.

Yep, good casting choice even if it wasn't in the comics.&&Honestly thanks for pointing that out, it actually does enrich the character for me.&&Ron Perlman is always cool.

Most of the time actors careers depend mostly or at least more on how they are to work with than their skill or talent itself. That's why you see a few really great actors not getting the jobs or recognition you'd think someone of their calibre would get (Edward Norton for example), while other, maybe not as talented actors, or really any creative person I imagine too, continue to get jobs all the time, just because people love working with them. If you're talented and easy to work with, you'll likely go the full way in Hollywood! And idk, I think batista definitely has potential.

John Wick: Chapter Three Release Date Set for 2019,34788,705m5t,http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/887717-john-wick-chapter-three-release-date-set-for-2019#/slide/1,1477,1505427331.0,,"May 17, 2019 if anyone was wondering.&&I'm just glad John Leguizamo survived two movies. We kinda got left with a cliffhanger with that auto repair.&&Wick 3: The Wickier Man&&or November 17th, 2028 for fellow Australians here&&John Wick 3: The Re-penciling.&&That they're dropping this in May is a hugely encouraging sign. It'll be going up against blockbusters so I have to imagine they'll be upping the budget accordingly. The first JW had a budget of $20 million; Chapter 2 had $40 million. Imagine a trilogy conclusion that has $80 million dollars at its disposal.&&They could literally make a John Wick-Continental Hotel universe with stories about all the other assassins.&&The first movie we were told John killed three men in a bar with a pencil. A fucking pencil.

Last movie we saw John use [two pencils](https://youtu.be/bxaSSqKdiR0?t=2m22s) to kill two men.

This movie, I want John to use chopsticks he was using as he was eating in a restaurant. Hell, [make them metal if you want](https://nextshark.com/why-koreans-use-metal-chopsticks/).&&Wow, 2019 is shaping up to be fucking awesome for movies.&&As an ex handgun instructor, I found his shooting technique accurate to real life special ops. It impressed me immensely. They hired a real professional to choreograph his handgun technique. I can hardly wait for the third instalment. &&I can't wait until John learns that Winston manipulated him to take over the underworld.  Both of those guys are going to bring it so hard it's going to be amazing.  &&Common's in everything now&&[Sooooo, he's back?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfpoSrCGsQ)&&This time they killed his turtle&&Very excited for this. Chapter 2 just doubled down on what made the first great. Hope they hit gold a third time. &&There's only one way this'll end and it won't be pretty.&&This time it's just Wick, 3 men in a bar, and a pencil. A   fucking pencil. &&Keanu Reeves is the star of two of the best action trilogies of all time.&&""They killed his goldfish...Now 387 people must die.""&&Wick 3: Electric Boogeyman&&God that's sooooooooooo far away. 

I'm glad they're taking their time but fuck do I want it now.&&Hopefully Tyler Bates can produce a better score, that was the only thing I was let down with for John Wick chapter 2. It was basically remixed and retooled sections of score from the first movie.&&How is Jon Wick going to make it out of this mess?

-everyone in the world is after him.

-no car

-no house full of weapons

-he cant stay at the continental.

-the Night king has a dragon 

He's fucked.&&Be seeing you, John. &&Hmm, hope its better than chapter two&&Part of me can't believe how better this is than The Matrix. And only because of Keanu.&&I should watch John Wick: Chapter Two&&[deleted]&&John Wick movies 1,2,3 and 4 are the prequals to I am Legend. He killed everyone else&&I wonder if he'll effortlessly shoot a bunch of hitmen in the head while never encountering any serious threats in this one.&&Unpopular opinion of the day, I'm prepared for downvotes:

I loved the first John Wick. The backstory, pulling him out of retirement based on a dog that, for awesome reasons, he felt incredibly attached to.

The second one felt hollow and sort of shallow, action only with not much backstory.

What I would have preferred as a sequel would have been a prequel, telling his story from back in the day.

Then, the next movie would have been great explaining his escape and how he engineered it and got out of the game, while explaining how he met his wife and fell in love with her.

I dunno, maybe it's just me, but it just felt like Wick 2 was a shoot em' up with no real depth, so Wick 3 doesn't sound too exciting unless I have a reason to be invested in the characters.&&It's taking so long because he's about to go in the craziest kill streak in history.&&Perhaps John Wick needs an Accountant?&&The John Wick franchise is one of my favorites. I've always loved Keanu as an actor but more as a human and these movies are just ~~him~~

As much as matrix is Keanu...I feel like for me John Wick is the best Keanu movies. &&The first two were such great movies.&&Calling it now, his dog is going to save him at some part of this movie! &&Hope it's better than the second one...hell, the first one. &&Imagine it's just a few minutes of him running around through New York before some well hidden assassin knifes him in the back after the countdown is over.

 ""The knife is directly in your heart, remove it.. you die... keep it in... you die""

""god.. dammit... I should have.. killed... youuu.. (dead)""

THE END&&I think I'm the only one who thought this movie (I've only seen the 2nd one) was just ok? The choreography for the action scenes was good but something just got repetitive about it being SO pistol heavy. &&[deleted]&&Hope they can close it out as strong as the 1 and 2. I think it would be cool if Carrie-Anne Moss or Hugo Weaving to make an appearance. &&The candle melts, the Wick burns&&Wicker 3: Wild Hunt&&Let´s hope it gets better than John-all-my-enemies-are retarded-Wick-2.

Seriously, the stunt coordinator in the 2nd one forgot to choreograph the actions of the goons. They just walk towards him until he decides to shoot them. As long as they are not in frame they don´t exist in the logic of the movie.

Even my father in law, who usually watches every action movie and has fun with it, got bored after the 10th guy just ran towards him to collect his headshot.

Am i crazy, did anyone else had this feeling?&&John Wick is the closest thing to a proper Max Payne movie we'll ever get.&&He better kill five people with a paper clip!&&Hell yeah. I just saw the first one about a month ago, once my power is back on (4 days gone now, fuck you Irma) I plan to watch the second. What a cool series. &&I really hope they make this one better. Chapter Two was alright but couldn't compare with the first one. The first one had a lot of visceral and realistic (for the most part) moments, and the second one had whatever you call the suppressor shootout undetected in a  busy subway. All the action scenes where more cut up and less fluidic. To top it off, I felt the story lost focus as the started to give us more detail about the world. Dare I say it, it was like going from The Matrix to The Matrix Reloaded. &&Chapter two was a disappointment &&I saw the first one recently but I don't really understand why r/movies is so obsessed with the series. I found it to be an above average action thriller, but that's it.&&He gonna be ded&&After the week I've had at school, this is exactly the news I needed to get me through.

I asked what the deal was with us getting the movie 3 months later than the rest of the world and it went something like:

>Her: ""Australians just pirate it anyway so the release here is low priority""

>Me: ""But piracy is only so high here because you are making us wait months later to pay to see the movie""

>Her: ""Yeah but the first John Wick didn't perform great here because of piracy""

>Me: ""Yeah because it released after the rest of the world""

>Her: ""Yeah maybe I guess""

Anyway, they released JW2 in Australia 3 days before the international Blu Ray release, so everybody just pirated it instead. They could have had my money 3 months ago had they just released the damn movie. They have the ability to alleviate their own problem but just blame piracy because it's easier.&&[removed]&&Ohhhhhh...ahh It's sad how true this is. &&Nah, whenever the web-dl hits the trackers.&&This is why you pirate.&&Please.

Almost everything in the movies is practical effects on a relatively small scale. You can throw money at a movie as much as you want, but you still need a good story for it to be good. Transformers has massive budgets and they're completely shit. JW is relatively small but fantastic. &&If they get a 50-60 budget and get some big actors for the bad guys, we're in for some great stuff. I've seen JW 2 four times and these movies are the pinnacle of action movies in the US right now besides Fury Road. &&Am I the only one who didnt like the second one? It was too over the top and didnt make sense. The first one had such great moments and the second one fell flat for me. There were no outstanding ""oh shit THAT'S the John Wick everyone fears""&&Everything that made number 1 great could be done with 20 or 80 million.

All those fucking great lines and character interactions were what made it great, along with the gunplay.

Ask anyone what their favorite moments in that movie are, and it won't be some giant setpiece or his car getting destroyed.

It'll be the 'oh' scene. Or the cop coming to the door and demurely conversing with John in front of a dead body before wishing him a good night and walking off. It'll be the head guy saying 'He's the fucking man you send to *kill* the boogeyman!'

Or it'll be that awesome scene in the club with absolutely *perfect* music.

None of them require heaps of money to make. They require great actors and greater writing.

I'll take a John Wick 1 over an amazing spectacle with explosions and hundreds of cars raining from the ceiling or whatever. John Wick was always a slicker movie than that.&&Yup, it's trying to get a little bit of that summer money.

Encouraging sign.&&That can often take a movie like this in the wrong direction.&&I don't know if you're being tongue in cheek or serious but...

The other thing I like about the John Wick character is that he meshes a bunch of different martial arts in his hand to hand and gun play. I'm no expert but it looks like he is a master of Judo, Hopkido, and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.

EDIT: And this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtVmEOxLE1Q&&Have you ever watched Season 2-5 of Strike Back? The shooting technique in that show is ridiculously good.

He was training under Taran Butler. 

I remember reading somewhere that he can be shooting competitively. There's other videos of him rehearsing for the movie too.&&As someone who just owns guns and likes to shoot them his one handed press checks always give me a quarter chub.&&This. Whenever people tell me ""unrealistic"" in regards to the first movie, I know they've never fired a gun under stress be it competition or gunfight.&&Can you send me some of the evidence or proof besides a Winston smirk? That's not enough for me. And when 2 ended, I was thinking immediately that he has to kill everyone at the high table to take over or he'll never lead a normal life. So this has to end with him taking over anyway. 

Edit: or him dying, which I wouldn't be opposed to. It would be a nice ending.

Plus he'd be fit to take over. He's literally the best assassin ever. &&Explain?  Is that the Lawrence Fishburne character?

If it's good, it's going to be one of the most consistently good trilogies ever.&&The director and Keanu talked a bit about their plans and they sound great. Nothing solid but just what they're going for will be nuts. 

Edit : it's one the empire spoiler podcast special for John wick 2 &&I just saw both movies for the first time in the last couple of weeks.  I liked Chapter 2, but I felt that certain elements of it required a much higher suspension of disbelief, like when Cassian is chasing John through Rome, they're shooting at each other around hundreds of bystanders, and literally nobody cares.  It really took me out of the movie.&&Eh. 2 was good and all, but it suffered the same problem as Guardians 2 in my opinion. It was just more of the same. While that's not a bad thing, it didn't add anything new. Eventually, if you keep doing that, people get fatigued and lose interest.

Makes it even cooler.&&Could do it as #4.&&Don't know that one but perhaps it'll be an episode of [The Continental](http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/john-wick-tv-show-keanu-reeves-prequel-the-continental-hotel-1201841666/)?&&See, I don't want to know what the ""impossible task"" was. I liked that they left it vague because I doubt it could actually meet expectations based on what he has done.&&A friend tried to get me to watch JW1 and told me about the dog. My immediate thought was.... That's stupid. But I like guns and I love the KR in action movies so I watched it. And loved it. But I never really considered it about it about the dog. To me it was about them entering his house, taking his car, and also killing the dog. For a man that got out of his work for love and to have it all stripped away, why not seek them out? 

For JW2, he's made peace and gotten the car back. It's done. He's out. And then he has to pay back the marker. It wasn't his home being destroyed. It was his actions in the first film that brought him back and caused the marker to be invoked. And he still tried to say no, but his actions have consequences. 

And the killing in the hotel will create the consequence he faces in JW3. It's a recycled story for sure. And the entire idea of that type of world even existing is ludicrous. But they are awesome action films with just enough backstory to make it worthwhile. &&I sadly agree that there was no depth. On the other hand I don't want to see the backstory. It would ruin the mystery of the whole thing. I want to see a good story though. Last one while awesome, felt put together too fast. Like all a sudden there is a coin from a dude who helped him pull off his impossible job? From what I've seen he needs no help. So wtf? It ruined the unkillable charachter for me. &&I feel almost the same way. I think the only thing that made the first one really good was the action and how it was executed. The second one was really dull and felt like more of the same but not as exciting.&&Agree 100%. &&Agree completely. It's like they noticed wow this got huge and had no idea why, so they just made a casual action movie with John Wick.&&Lol no, that would mean more Anna Kendrick&&First one is definitely the better one, so just as well you got to see that one before your power cut out :P Not to say the second one is bad, but it's more of a 7/10 as opposed to a 10/10 like the first.&&Yeah, you're right. The film suffered from sequel bloat. The creators were like, ""Oh, you liked that last film? Well we're going to do the exact same film, but this time with bigger explosions, more bad guys, and quicker cutaways!"" It just became a blur of boring nonsense after awhile. Go back to the simpler setup, and great choreography we had in the last film, and do it while giving us a storyline we can actually sink our teeth into. Not a retread of what came before.&&I'm in the same boat. Above average is generous...&&What if that was #3&&The one thing John probably can't kill. Mass marketed Disney owned Star Wars/superhero ventures &&Still, following so soon after Avengers 4 is a bit risky. Not sure why they wouldn't put it in April or some other month that isn't as crowded.

It's something how that actor went from a primary character on Fringe to a fringe character at best. I haven't seen him in ANYTHING else since Fringe and JW. I just looked up his imdb and he's busy, just not in anything I've seen I guess.

Ugh.  When random strings of text on reddit make you unbelievably angry.&&Literally makes zero sense to me. Why not release it everywhere the same day?&&The Australian box office is pretty small anyway, you generally only get a couple of million for a movie unless it's a big release (eg. Marvel movies) and everything else hangs around the 10-2 million mark. 

So why even bother releasing it to Australia so late? Just give it a limited release on with the rest of the world at select cinemas and then hope you recoup a bit more from home video. Gives fans a chance to see it on the big screen while it's relevant.

I went and saw it as a fan, but I was shitty that I could of just pirated it and watched it at home for $0 dollars.

Also just an FYI the same year John Wick came out the Lego Movie came out and was second best performer of the year here (and was made in part here) yet got released two months later than the rest of the world. So then comes the Batman Lego movie, same scenario and gets the same shitty treatment of getting released two months later also.

So I wonder what the real cause for delays to our big island is? Because these two scenarios contradict one another for the reasons.
&&So that's why I saw Chapter 2 in a nearly empty cinema.&&Plain and simple, if they had've released it normally I would've seen it in cinemas and gave them money instead of finding a copy on /r/megalinks a few months later.&&It was one of the few movies I was looking forward to watch in theaters but then it never came. Some people in charge just have no idea what they're doing. I mean after the first the hype for the second one was massive and I'm sure that would've shown in the box office too.&&I saw both in theatres in australia but fuck having to wait that extra 4 months or something for JW2.&&For what it's worth, we in Spain never got the 1st one in cinemas and we got the 2nd three months later as well.

We never got an explanation, though, and I wrote to a bunch of people in the industry about it.&&May 18, 2019&&> Demonoid

Well, that's a name I have not heard in a long time. I didn't even know it even came back after going down in 2013. &&More money also means better cinematography.  I mean look at the difference between 1 and 2.  The club scene in 1 was probably the coolest location in the film.  It was tight, focused and excellent, but Chapter 2 took it to a new level.  Way more elaborate and awesome looking scene's, like the subway, or hall of mirrors, or the huge party.  
You don't need a lot of money to make a great Jon Wick movie.  It's just minimal plot and great choreographed action.  With more money though you have the more awesome looking the sets, more great actors and overall the ability to add a lot more to what is really a simple movie.&&I actually felt like the second one really suffered due to them trying to make it ""bigger"". It was less about him expertly taking out 8 guys in a quasi-believable (within the rules of the movie) fashion and more about him just shooting 40-50 bad guys in every location. Not nearly as enjoyable and bordering on parody at times. &&> get some big actors for the bad guys

Tom Cruise as Vincent from ""Collateral"".&&Fuck, Fury Road blew me away.  &&It was actually the opposite for me.


>There were no outstanding ""oh shit THAT'S the John Wick everyone fears""


Really? Not even the pencil scene?&&Maybe that was kind of the point though? JW1 was supposed to set that up fear you mentioned up for you, so that going into chapter 2, you were pretty certain that John could handle any situation; there was a bit less ""building up"" needed.

So rather what the story did was just pile it on thick to make you go, ""oh ok shit, I knew Wick was a badass but certainly he can't handle *all this*.""

So the over-the-top...ness could perhaps be part of the necessary progression of that character? Like, how many people did they need to hire to just to even get a glimmer of hope that Wick would go down, ya know? It *had* to be over the top because John Wick made it that way by returning.

But btw I'm not calling you wrong for thinking the way you do, that's just a possible interpretation I made up in my head. I can totally see where you'd walk into CH2 of that series and be expecting just those ""holy shit"" singular moments of this character we've come to expect so much from. I guess in this case tho it wasn't the character ""ramping up in the sequel"" so much as it was the environment/world.&&> There were no outstanding ""oh shit THAT'S the John Wick everyone fears""

Really? 

Tarasov shitting his breaches knowing the dreaded John Wick is coming for him, even when he stumbles in half-alive?

Joanna immediately accepting her demise as she sees John appear?

Cassian immediately knowing John out of retirement = someone important in the building is dead?

Santino's trembling hands when he realizes John can and will break the Continental rules, barely keeping up the cold mob boss facade?

Nothing?&&I loved it, I don't get why people are shitting on it. It was great,&&I'm with you on this. I thought the ""you killed my dog"" was one of the best plot motivators for a revenge action movie ever. Nothing like that in the second one.

(CANT MAKE SPOILER TAG WORK HERE)

[Instead he turns into quite an unlikable character in the end.

I also realized they made John Wick invincible in the catacombs. Seriously, in one scene he actually flapped his jacket a little to avoid bullets. No need to stagger back to the hotel bleeding and getting stitched up like in the first movie, naw let's have him fight another assasin directly after and almost win.](#spoiler)&&There's also a movie called [""Ballerina""](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lionsgate-plotting-john-wick-universe-ballerina-action-script-1024318) that is rumoured to be in the same universe. &&I was being serious. I haven't seen it yet, but would you have been surprised if we found out Atomic Blonde was an assassin from the Continental? It could work.

Hopefully this TV series is on one of the premium cable channels because that's the only way it will work, they need the violence (and most likely sex).

I'd actually really like to see him die. Too many movies have those nice, happy endings. I'd love to see a dark, gritty ending. 

Or, maybe an ending where he doesn't come out on top but finally recognizes that he's got nothing but a life of hiding ahead of him, an endless game of hide and seek.&&Winston is John's friend that runs the Continental.

It didn't live up to the first in tone or execution, but was still a good enough film in its own right. &&I heard a podcast where they kind of explained that the idea behind that sequence was that they're in this secret world that is so disconnected from normal life that even insanity like that goes unnoticed.

Chapter 2 wasn't as good. They went ""more is better"" for the sequel. Probably won't see chapter 3... Just like Matrix 3. &&Hey, its alright, I agree with you, I loved the first JW as a big action fan. It had a good story that made the action have purpose. The ending was alittle weak though.

I need to rewatch JW2, but it just felt like the action lacked something, like another smooth-over of the choreography. Even the Catacombs scene, had some great technique like the one-handed shottie reload to pistol draw, but the action turned into a video game with auto headshots. Common, the female assassin, and the killing assassins montage were pretty bad too, didnt care for their characters in the movie at all.  It just didnt feel like those assassins could challenge JW like the female and club fight did in JW1. JW2 they literally make him bulletproof, even if that was a badass scene where he gets his suit.


The villain was generic as hell too. Atleast in JW1, the mob boss was different in a way. He wasnt just making deals and double crossing cause he was evil. It helped sell JW as a badass more than having him shoot 3 guys in the head coming around the corner. The whole Babayaga and ""Oh"" were great scenes in the first one because it didnt go back to that generic mob boss.

It might be apparent that I have some issues with the direction they took the sequel.&&I liked that the first movie was about John and what he did. We got to see what happened in a night in his life, and everything else was hinted at or mentioned in passing. It was a lot more intimate and interesting, almost like it actually could happen. The second movie for some reason felt the need to show a whole world of over the top assassins, with some ridiculous old fashioned command center with typewriters and tattooed women, bullet proof suits, and other gimmicks. Unfortunately the ending suggested that the next one will be even more of a spectacle.

In some ways it reminded me of the difference between the first and second Matrix movie. I liked the first one, but after seeing the second I'm not particularly looking forward to the third.&&I agree.  I thought John Wick's motivation for the sequel lacked the emotional impact of the first film, and it became more of a generic action flick.  I'm hoping with the 2019 release date that means they are taking more time with the story and not just adding more effects.&&Yeah I absolutely loved the 1st movie with the expert weapons handling and the awesome executions here and there. I was on the edge of my seat.   

The second one I almost stopped watching because it seemed like one long 3-gun competition promo video. Also, at times it felt like watching someone play Call of Duty when they won't just run to the next objective and they keep fighting infinite waves of enemies in the same area. &&I literally thought the opening sequence of Chapter 2 was a parody film version of the original, like the Pee-Wee film at the end of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.&&I'd be so fucking happy if Tom came through.

Winston didn't want him to kill John after he was done?  &&That makes absolutely no sense at all. First off, he doesn't tell anyone to do anything related to John. Not to mention that he prevents John from being killed immediately. 

Let alone the fact that all the people John is killing are his customers! I don't think new assassins are made as often as John's killing them, i mean shit, Wick is single handedly causing a recession in the assassin economy. &&and the Bourne trilogy. &&The Empire podcast episode that is the spoiler special with both interviews&&I loved how they tossed humor into the fight scenes, it was a fresh take at least.

the totally unneeded shot of ruby's ass, to supposedly best assassins in the world not being able to take a head shot, the not being able to walk 20 feet in public with out yet another assassin. i'd presume its a niche career, yet every turn on a single city block had another one around the corner.

I agree completely with that, and I get your point.  I don't want him taking down the white house single handily or whatever no matter how awesome they make it.  Though with these movies I kinda let my suspension of disbelief take over.  
Id have to rewatch the first to give specific examples but I know there are dozens of things totally unrealistic even in the first one.  
I get your point though I think, and I do agree.  Basically I think that ya, if they start throwing money at idea's that simply seem cool then that's a shame.  If they use the extra money to take a fight scene in the story written for a bathroom and scale it up with budget to a fight in some elaborate set with more challenges then I'm all for it.&&> I just hope they don't have him shooting down helicopters and shit in the next one.

[With a car, maybe?](https://cinemafanatic.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/livefreeordiehard.jpg)&&My hope is that they're taking extra time to write a decent script. The story in the second one was pretty lacking imo. This could be complete confirmation bias, but I felt like the second chapter didn't have nearly as many close ups on Wick during the fight sequences. JW1 you really got to see the grit in his face, or the emotionless stare in the silent kills.

I could use more of Wick sneaking around I guess.&&[deleted]&&No reason you can't have both.  These guys obviously care about great action above all else.  If you give them a budget of 10 mil you get an awesome movie in a few locations with minimal ""dressing"".  You get John fighting hand to hand with guys in a kitchen (which was awesome in the first movie, no doubt).  
Up the budget to 50 or 60 mil and they still care most about the action as they've all said but now instead of a dark bathroom fight, it's some brightly lit can with lots of mirrors and more risky camera angles and editing and what not.  
You lose a little of the raw feeling I suppose but it makes up for it with even more risky visual shit.  
I don't know.  I'm not a movie writer, I just think giving passionate guys who won't stray from their idea a bigger budget makes a better movie.&&Yes all of that and the fact that the shootouts began to resemble the Blues Brothers car chase scene except with head shots substituting for police cars. 

The number of guys who run up to Wick so he can shoot them in the head is absurd. &&I agree. I had pretty high hopes after the opening scene which I loved.  Many people seemed to like 2 better but I didn't.  Though the bad guy was a pretty good asshole...I was thrilled to see him offed.  Arrogant little bastard.  Glad to see the pencil action. Really excited to see how they end the trilogy.  Will he survive? &&Because it is actually a Matrix reboot.&&Way too lazy to do the math, but I'm actually curious how heavily you'd need to line the bottom of the coat to make it work as a shield instead of just flopping up out of the way.  Even if it just worked with pistol fire it would be amusing.&&> The second movie for some reason felt the need to show a whole world of over the top assassins

Reddit, when the first came out:

""OMG, I love the underground world! I hope they show more of that in the sequel!""

Yeah, that was a terrible idea.&&You're not alone with that Matrix thing. I actually had a very similar vibe about it.&&Thats exactly the problem. It just seemed like there was a lot of action with nothing to emotionally tie you to the character or the urgency of the situations.

It was all just a bit too campy this time around as well. At least as unrealistic as the first one was it still had some logic and plausibility in it. I sorta think they over elaborated on the underworld lore aspects  too much or at least took it way too far making it hard to suspend belief.

This sequel seemed to just try to make everything bigger and more elaborate but failed to make it all meaningful and captivating to watch.

Now dont get me wrong there is some world class fight choreography and execution going on throughout all of the movie and Keanu definitely busted his ass to pull off some amazing stuff. But because of the subpar story, sloppy action scene transitioning and lack of character development it all just became a typical shoot em up action flick which falls short of what i think it could have been.

That being said despite the seconds films short falls its still worlds better than most american action flicks. As well as Keanu plays his part and trains as he does i cant NOT go see the 3rd whens it released though. I just hope they do a better job tying things up. I think they can still do an epic job.&&If they're making a television series which they hope will go on for multiple seasons, it has to be more than just violence. &&Great, another stereotyper. That's what everyone gets wrong about HBO, there's not softcore porn for 5 minutes every episode, it's 4 minutes and sometimes it's more than softcore. &&They made a post the other day, but patience.

He subtly reminds him he's safe there, then he smirks when the deadman walks away.  The entire second movie was a manipulation designed to pit John against all of the people in charge of the underworld.  It's a hostile takeover.

Remember in jw2 when the Italian concierge checks to make sure the Pope is not the target?

Between blockbuster season 3quel and that line as foreshadowing, I think he will target the POTUS or a nearly equivalently high profile target. Maybe without the help of the Continentals. The only way for the assassin's order to exist in such a high profile manner is for the government supporting it all the way to the top.

It is inevitable, Mr. Anderson.

Huh, just occurred to me that Hugo Weaving would be a good POTUS, general, or lead body guard.&&That's nothing. Vin Diesel sank a Russian nuclear attack submarine with a car. &&Yeah, John Wick 1 felt more *personal*, that added some real intensity to it.

Also, with everybody being assassins, it kind of loses some tension: the mob in the first film felt like a bunch of dangerous yet desperate people. The assassins are just in it for money and power plays - it all feels more abstract that way.&&Realistic *for Hollywood.&&More than the second one. Seemed like one of the most common jobs people have is assassin. In the first film, it made sense to say ""He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman"", then in the sequel it seemed *necessary* to have boogeymen who kill other boogeymen.&&Yeah the first movie John Wick came off as a super badass assassin, mostly because the fights/gunfights were semi-plausible and he won because he just seemed *that good*.

In 2 the bad guys were just moving targets that would barely attempt to shoot him until they were in his triple tap range. If 3 is like that I can skip it until I can stream it.&&Really? The opening scene was exactly when I went ""oh shit what have they done...""

It sets the tone for the entire film. John Wick can now survive three cars plowing into him at full speed, get up, kick people with the legs that just got taken out from under him, and walk away.&&They could've shown more without going over the top. The gun merchant in the hotel was a good way of showing more. Every person in the entire city secretly being a professional assassin wasn't.&&I'd settle for no boobs, butt, or sex if it meant having a great story.&&It could also have conversations and character development!&&I get that, Im kinda frustrated, but I get it. I just think its a little silly to not anticipate an influx of subscribers like this. Not only did they drop a monthly subscription from 50 bucks to 10, but with word of mouth, social media, and so on, how could they not expect so many people to jump on that? &&You get charged once when you sign up, and then you don't get charged again until a month after you activate it.&&I got charged twelve days in. Signed up a month ago. No responses, no card. Real disappointed right now. &&I cant even log-in though. I have no confirmation email. Nothing.

Instead I got that stupid email about theater locations that they still work at. Which is admittedly more infuriating. &&So Constantine 2: John Wick&&>Throw in all the religious and classical imagery, it looks like Wick is something of an angel born fallen.

keep it to the assassin underworld. I wanna see more about this ""High Table"" and all that stuff. Maybe go international.

In fact it's very dangerous. &&I don't think so. Even John has to play by the rules and there is no indication that before that he had ever done anything to break the rules of the world he was in. He followed the rules so much that he actually went through with the hit in on Gianna even though he hated Santino and wanted to kill him. This was a case of him being pushed just too far, like in the first film. The difference here is in the first film he didn't break any of the rules of the underworld, Iosef ostensibly did by assaulting John, killing his dog and stealing his car. Seems he became fair game for retribution as far as the rest of the crime world was concerned.

Anyways Winston knew that the situation with Santino was bullshit from the start. Santino is a scumbag who gets others to break decorum for him and he had John in a tough place. I don't think it took a genius to figure out what was going to happen if you knew all of the events, which Winston did. &&[deleted]&&He doesn't play around either.  No talks, boasts or torture.

Honestly, seems like you guys are reading a bit much into it.&&Iosef broke no rules other than he fucked with John Wick. That's the whole point of the movie. Nobody in the Continental tries killing each other because they are following the rules while in the Continental (until Perkins twats the place up) but outside the hotel they're all trying to fuck each other's shit up.

And of course Winston knew where this was going to end up, but I don't see that having anything to do with Winston's goals and more to do with him knowing John's... tenacity.&&Yes.&&I have always watched movies with subtitles. I will be watching with someone else and they will be annoyed by it, but I have a hard time without having them.

What I love about older DVDs is the effort they put into making things interactive. The Shrek 2 Menu is my favourite example of that.,34660,6yt3qx,https://youtu.be/sMoA1YuS4vc,1400,1504852381.0,,"And the Shrek Idol on the bonus disc was the best thing ever!&&then you fall asleep during the movie and wake up to the same shit repeating over and over again until you finally cant take it anymore and go searching for the remote to turn it off&&Much better than the Generic ""Lets show the best parts of the movie in the menu before they hit play"" type of menu you see these days. &&I've heard this on loop so many times. Pure nostalgia.&&I used to love the interactive things the 2nd disc for Harry Potter DVD's used to have. Was almost like an interactive game. &&I bought a ""fight club"" dvd a few years back, one of my favourite movies and I was dying to watch it again. When the menu came on it started of as being a menu for ""never been kissed"" then switched to the fight club menu. Fooled the hell outta me, thought I got some fucked up disk from the factory. 
https://youtu.be/3RI87sgawFk &&[deleted]&&The Shrek 1 DVD came with software to replace the audio with your own voice, me and my sister spent hour trying to perfect the 'and then I ate some rotten berries' scene.

They're all the same exact template with almost zero changes whatsoever for each disc.&&damn donkey did the first 2 _____ 2 furious joke&&Back when menus were listed under ""Special features""&&My favorite dvd menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpHb3uIkoiY&&Just one of the things that streaming content doesn't provide.

Everything from the menu to the extended versions/director's cut and ""making of"" vignettes made actually buying the disc worth it IMO.  Now you just stream the movie and that's it.  Show's over.

The same thing happened with music, in a way.  Album covers were an important part of the whole package, and were in many cases great art on their own.  I also used to love pouring over liner notes and reading lyrics as the songs played.  Now the song just shows up on your phone.&&Play the movie. Ya. Play. &&Fuck man, I forget just how funny the first two Shrek films are - brilliant films that can sometimes be tarnished by the two films following them&&The menu for the ""house of 1000 corpses"" is fuckin awesome as well. 

[aren't we fuckin funny](https://youtu.be/Q3zHiWdtcnE) &&The first DVD my family owned was Shrek. Crazy how amazing the concept of a DVD menu was at that time. Donkey bouncing around saying ""Pick Me!"". I remember there was a feature that would make the magic mirror give you random magic 8-ball type answers. &&For those who weren't around in the infancy of DVD (1998 or earlier), those early discs were fantastic.  Put in the disc and the movie immediately starts.  The menu only came up if a) you pressed the menu button on your controller or b) the movie ended.

The Matrix was a wake up call to the studios about what could be done with the interactivity and logic capabilities of the disc, and soon after that came the unskippable stuff.  Those first few years were fantastic, though.&&God bless DVDs that auto-played the movie after a loop or two&&Is there a sub where they comment on DVD menus? That sure would rock&&[deleted]&&Memento. Crazy DVD box and ridiculous menu system. &&Hi, I'm male supermodel Derek Zoolander.

I'm not sure if I should admit that this was my job for 7 years. I was a Motion Graphic Artist that created DVD and BluRay menus. &&Anyone else remember when DVD menus used to have Easter Eggs? There would be hidden buttons on the menus that take you to videos, content and special features that aren't listed on the box.

I haven't seen a DVD do that in years, and I've never seen a blu-ray do it.&&Wait, how is this interactive?  &&A few of my favorites over the years

[**Harold & Kumar go to white castle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6-SnNMCnJs) They start talking about the DVD menu screen.

**Me, Myself & Irene** - Standard menu but if you left it for too long it would shatter and come back all fucked up and jim carrey had switched into his alter ego. Cant find it on youtube :( none stay on the menu long enough. 

**BORAT** - If you go to the language and subtitles option theres an option for ""yiddish"". If you pick it an alarm goes off and calls for someone to come get the jew. 

&&Or how they would have little mini games sometimes&&I'm of the opposite opinion - I hated OTT menus. For instance, the Red Dwarf DVDs that the BBC released had unskippable transition animations between each menu, meaning if you just wanted to watch a single episode, it took literal minutes to even get to the episode selection screen. It was maddening.&&Who remembers Lion King 2 1/2's Virtual Safari on the bonus disk? Me and my sister loved it so much, we used to play it more than the actual movie.&&I miss DVD commentary so much. I really wish that was an option on streaming services. &&the lion king had a whole safari adventure game on one of their dvds&&I agree. 

My favourite DVD feature is on Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There's a button for the ""Hard of Hearing"" and when you click it someone yells the menu options. It's hilarious. &&When DVDs were new they had all sorts of features that *most* studios / companies didn't take advantage of, like multiple angles, commentary tracks, etc. The only DVD I ever saw that really used every possible option was, of course, porn.

But I still miss LaserDisc. Listening to my player scoot the optical head around the disc so it could play the other side was just the bee's knees :)&&I love my Galaxy Quest DVD. The man menu has an ""Omega 13"" button that does nothing unless you first watch the entire movie end-to-end. Am not going to add the spoiler.&&[here's an entire database of movie menus if anybody is interested](http://dvdmoviemenus.com) &&I once left an Office DVD on repeat for ages, the one where Michael says 'I'd say, got milk and she'd say 'that's not funny...she always knew what do say to cheer me up' and I can still hear it now, over and over again.&&I remember buying the special edition of this movie and the box had a 3d shreck head pluss the ears actually had green slime in them you don't get that shit now &&The thing for me is that I just didn't care. I wanted to put the movie in and see it play. The novelty was neat for the first couple of times, but it wore off really quickly. 

That really goes for 90% of the extra features on DVD's. I used to treat those like selling points ""omg I have to get the special edition look at all the extra features"", but eventually I came to realise that deleted scenes were almost universally deleted for a really good reason. The making-of featurettes got progressively less interesting as eventually it just turned into ""So this is a 3d wireframe of the CGI we inserted everywhere, look at all these computers and green screens!"". 

The last features I ever really cared about were the commentary tracks, and even those got boring too. It always used to be the director giving them, and eventually the novelty wore off and I guess the people giving the commentaries got more and more bored of giving them, or they found less and less interesting people to give them. 

I switched to streaming-only viewing about 7-8 years ago. I don't miss DVD's at all. I skipped Blu-Ray entirely. All I want is to click a button and get instant movies. Simple. No need for interactive menus or any other fluff. &&'Interactive' doesn't mean what you think it means.&&Used to scare the shit out of me as a kid when I fell asleep watching Jurassic Park: The Lost World DVD and then get woke up by a raptor jumping through glass in my room &&Try the menus for *Who Framed Roger Rabbit*&&Oh my, I loved that stuff as a kid. I remember the Lion King had like this ridethrough of the map and you could choose where to go. It was the best.&&Shrek 2 is such a great sequel. It's so different from the first, in a lot of ways, but it's so fun. The series quickly shit the bed, but those first two films made my childhood. &&Older DVDs had great menus and interactive features. One little thing I really do miss about many older DVDs is the inserts they used to put inside the cases with chapter listings, photos, production notes, etc. Some movies I really felt like I got my money's worth: slipcover, special features disc(s), booklet insert, etc. Nowadays you pay $20-25 for a Blu Ray with a single disc and no insert (not in all cases).


Oh, and disc art. I used to love that. Most discs don't have that anymore.&&My favorite are the pigs in the Shrek 1 menu...""Play the moovie. YA. PLAY.""

https://youtu.be/U1p0D5ihJqc?t=58s&&I remember the Shrek 1 DVD has the little pigs saying ""PLAY THE MOVIE, JA, PLAY"" which was left on for hours once, it's embedded into my brain now.&&The mini games some came with were awesome. Best examples would be the first two Harry Potter DVDs.&&I remember the special edition of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. When you click on ""hard of hearing"" it screams all of the different selections at you. Scared the crap out of me as a kid.&&Haha holy shit this brings back some memories. My grandparents had a vacation house in Palm Springs, and someone was always out there at least once every 2 months or so (big family). Well, we had a maid service that would come every month to clean up the place and do some tiny maintenance (dust, get rid of cobwebs, etc.). One day while dusting they must have accidentally turned on the DVD player with this exact disk in it. Better yet, the system was connected to some outside speakers on the deck. So for ~2 months, our neighbors were listening to Eddie Murphy scream ""PICK ME! PICK ME!"" over the loudspeakers.... &&Far far away idol was my shit&&The Lost DVD menus were the best. Just a scene of an environment from the show that's moving and if you waited long enough something would happen.

They said that they were going to allow me to keep working there but I was not allowed to have any conversation with her at all. I walked right into my office, grabbed my stuff and walked right out the door. I will always make that connection with that movie.&&Me, myself and Irene always had a fun menu where if you let it sit long enough it'd change to Hank moments and have darker music &&My first DVD player died because I fell asleep with it on and it kept looping the menu for hours.&&That doesn't offset how lousy they look on the modern large screen TV..&&God, this is one of the movies where I actually prefer the finnish dub...&&The studios also put effort into a website for each movie that they were promoting, that offered desktop wallpapers and other cool things.   &&The dvd menu for Harold and Kumar go to White Castle fucked me up.

I was high and fell asleep and woke up to Kal Penn being mad at me for watching the menu. I was like ""dude I don't know where the remote is"" and John Cho said something about ""maybe they're looking for the remote"" and I agreed with him and Kal got mad and started yelling. I remember crying afterwards and saying sorry a lot and went to my room.

I tried to send an email apologizing for leaving them on my tv for so long but didn't know where to send it to and fell asleep.&&I too sexy for my shirt!

What OP doesn't tell you about THIS particular screen is hitting the ""Menu"" button in your DVD GUI does NOTHING.  

It's a LOCKED SCREEN, like the FBI screen.  You MUST pick an option.  So you default to (I think) the Donkey option.  Then, and only then, can you hit menu to get to the front.

(Of course this leaves out that you have to do this blind as most infotainment systems won't let the driver or front passenger actually SEE what's going on, and asking the 7-year old all the way in the back what's going on is like playing a game of telephone with a barely-coherent badger.)

&&> wake up to the same shit repeating over and over again until you finally cant take it anymore

funny story, me and the mrs when we decided to get intimate after watching 24 (not because of 24 by the way; terrorists being thwarted and stuff blowing up is not our fetish)  but the DVD menu on the first season literally ruined the mood because it features the bad guy going ""we're watching youuuuu"" before uttering an evil little cackle.

Thanks evil guy, hard to keep the mood going with you blurting that out every 30 seconds.&&Slept over at a friends one night and we didn't go to bed till like 5 AM. Shrek 2 was playing on the TV and I was absolutely exhausted. My friend began to torture me with this. Every time I'd be almost asleep Shrek would scream like a banshee. Fucking horrible PTSD.&&I remember my wife worked in a electronics store around the time the original Shrek DVD came out. They had it on display on one of the main TV's with the sound on and it was just hours and hours of Donkey shouting ""Oooh Oooh! Pick me, Pick me"" over and over again. They used to secretly turn down the volume every so often but the manager would come over and turn it back up again. She said it was excruciating. &&Play ze moofee!

Shrek.&&The first time I saw the first Despicable Me movie I was drunk as hell and it was way early in the morning when somebody suggested watching it because they had the DVD. Thing is, if I don't stay active while drunk I just fall asleep. So right at the start of the movie I fall asleep and occasionaly I wake up, watch about 10 seconds of the movie just to fall back asleep again.   
Having never seen anything of the movie (not even ads) I had no idea of the plot of the thing and had a hard time recollecting what the hell I saw the night before: There was a bald guy? And some...yellow aliens? There were girls too. And something about moon?

That movie(s) are weird if you just have like 5 random moments from it you vaguely remember.


&&me and my ex would usually have sex after watching a movie in bed... i have the menu music of like a dozen different DVDs burned into my memory because neither of us wanted to spoil the moment to get up and turn it off.&&Cake- short Skirt, long jacket riff on the Saving Silverman menu.

I would rent a new dvd almost every day.  I still have nightmares of the dvd menu for requiem for a dream.  Not the movie, I had to turn that off, and it is the only movie that I turned off, but the fucking dvd menu gives me the willies to this day. &&On the original Fight Club DVD, the barebones one with few special features, the FBI warning flashed and flickered for a split second while it played.

At the time, the only DVD drive around was on my dad's laptop and since it was portable, my friend and I would take the laptop to the garage and take turns recording one character's lines in seclusion, recording the loudest, goofiest takes to try to surprise each other and crack us up. Kinda like a form of audio MadLibs.

I see they included the feature with a few other DVDs, I always wished it would've really taken off, it was a blast&&Omg I remember this! One of my fondest childhood memories!&&I worked for THX doing QC review of the various Star Wars DVDs. We had to test every button from every screen, and Van Ling, the DVD producer came up with separate animations whether you were going from an A page to a B page, or from a B page to an A page. It took about 45 minutes just to QC the menus on one disc because all of the button combos we had to test. &&The Simpsons season 2 DVD is really bad about this, you had to click the ok button like 5 times before you could even select an episode because the DVD ""theme"" would mismatch the characters heads.

Jaime's just the gritty cynical reboot to Prince Charming's comedic spoof.&&I think you mean that the other way around,, jaime looks like real life prince charming &&It reminds me of the first five seasons of Red vs Blue on DVD (at least the remastered versions).
They usually had goofy intros, or if you waited long enough clips would play and the characters would take away menu options. The best was that before you got to the menu of Season 4, there were different menu options (one made the main menu a bunch of gibberish, one zoomed really close into the screen so you could only see part of the background, while another made the main menu so tiny you could barely see it).

I despise those loud ""bleep"" and ""thump"" noises so much. Shame it has to be on my all-time favorite movies.&&Those annoy me so much, and they just spoil the movie for friends who haven't yet seen it by showing highlights on the menu.

I love when movies do this, but it's not very common.&&There is no technical reason for video steaming services to not include different versions, audio tracks with commentary, extras like making-ofs, trailers, out-takes or any other kind of bonus content.

Music streaming services also have no technical reason to not include lyrics (some actually do that), music videos (that is in the works apparently), album covers or whole booklets.

It's just that it doesn't seem to be a thing, and apparently most (?) customers don't care. I would love having that for videos, but I think the publishers want to reserve some benefit for people who want to give them additional money for physical media. I don't care all too much regarding music and booklets. Most I have read from the time of CDs were not really important for the medium.&&That's why there is still a active bluray market. If you want extras, commentary etc. you buy the Bluray. If you want 4k you buy the bluray. 

If you just want to watch a movie real quick, you stream. It can exist next to each other. I still buy a lot of Blurays and have a active Netflix subscription.&&I have a feeling Netflix will implement something like this. The movie may be bundled with commentary, deleted scenes, minimal games, trivia, etc.

Just give it time. We only recently hit streaming video, so it needs about a decade of mainstream use before it gets boring.

We couldn't figure it for what felt like 20 minutes. Almost didn't watch the movie. Best experience with a DVD. &&Yes! I was just about it post this. Just look at this insanity: http://www.dvdtalk.com/mementoleguide.html&&It's a movie not a play. Why not call it the movie button? Well, a lot of [these buttons](https://vimeo.com/94535281) were written in the olden days when plays were movies.&&This is easily my favorite DVD menu of all time.  Even plays the trailer for the movie as a ""commercial"".&&Heh. Yeah, I worked for a company that made games for the Shrek & Harry Potter discs after I left. Think I had some Flash or Shockwave games on the X-Files, The Abyss and Alien Quadrilogy DVD-ROM content though. TCFHE was a steady client. &&Can you say which ones you worked on so we can properly ~~berate~~ praise you?

~~I'm~~ (*thanks phone* Edit: In) all seriousness, I meet more good DVD menus than bad, so thanks. That actually sounds like a pretty fun job, if you're allowed to be creative with it.

Is JavaScript used for menus? I feel like it's probably JavaScript.&&Remember eeggs.com?&&My first thought as well. This is a passive video clip. Nothing interactive about it.

&&Not sure about the menu, but the Shrek Idol part of the DVD allowed you to vote and choose your own ending. &&Yea, I mean it's not a bad menu screen, but I was let down seeing it after reading that title.&&My kids used to play that!&&It was 1 1/2, but I think all the Lion King films had their own virtual safari mini game, the one from the original actually frightening me because of it's starkly realistic atmosphere and dark savannah setting, the animals would come into the vehicle headlights and scare the hell out of ya!&&Me to man.  I loved DVD commentaries as a kid.  A crappy movie could be awesome in my eyes if it had an interesting commentary to go with it.  The best commentary hands down, is the Finding Nemo commentary.&&I was looking for this! &&Still have laser disk lol have old Star Wars lol &&Meh. I have a DVD of a concert of the band Pavement that was supposedly cool because you got to choose which angle to view. Fast forward today and the camera angle is no longer supported. Meaning, the whole concert is one angle and there's no proper direction when watching it. &&Also check the language tracks. You can watch the *entire movie* dubbed into Thermian!  Some very nice effort went into this disc.&&It's decent, but I wish someone would set up an archive of menu recreations in HTML5 so people could experience the easter eggs and mini games again.&&I love that they put the effort in the make actual Looney Tunes length Roger Rabbit cartoons. The episode at the carnival is amazing!&&What the actual fuck&&I feel like there's something you're not telling us.&&I'm confused, did she really find the marvel of theatrical entertainment that is Shrek 2 SO touching that it became inappropriate?&&Well maybe you shouldn't have emailed her [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTzM2WJsoJo) after

Time to go dig up that old DVD.&&So happy other people remember this&&It's 'Shrek's Swamp Stories' that it's in.&&The non-interactive version is in later DVD/Blu-Ray releases too&&I used to love watching the Director's Commentary on films, it was probably my favorite feature other than the film itself. You learn so much from them, it's like you were a part of the production. I was pretty disappointed when I started switching over to Blu Rays and found there weren't any.&&That’s why Disney Blu-Rays are the best! The blu ray for Beauty and the Beast has hours of bonus content, commentaries, and deleted scenes.&&Which seems totally backward! Now I don't need to buy DVDs to watch movies -- streaming it from one source or another is almost always cheaper -- so I need an extra incentive to get a physical copy. Instead, they take away one of the coolest incentives!&&This one and finding nemo would drive me crazy &&I was sad that this wasn't in that website further up the thread. Definitely the first one that comes to mind for me because I've heard it SO many times.

EDIT: I thought this person was saying they wished there was a ""Fight Club"" joke hidden in the fake menu for ""Never Been Kissed"". Not the actual DVD menu for the real movie. I didn't even know Never Been Kissed was a real movie.&&Unfortunately, the DVD also has Garfield 2 on it.&&As far as I remember, the 3D was fairly terrible. Used to love it as a kid though!&&That thing was annoying as a kid.  It seemed like no matter how quickly you reacted the input lagged and you would lose.

If you tried to pick Big Bad Wolf or some other side character, Simon would read the results and say ""Nope It's me, everyone!"" and the same video of him singing would play.

Which honestly shocked me at the time because in the years American Idol had been on I'd never once heard Simon Cowell sing. I didn't even know he could, I thought he was just some guy they put on the show to be a dick to people. &&Same, loved that one  &&Ah memories.  This whole thread has made me nostalgic.&&I *loved* those menus as a kid. I would just hop from menu to menu exploring. I remember the name Van Ling from the outtakes reel too.  
Revenge of the Sith had a bunch of static menus, though. It made me sad.&&I had the honor of working with Van Ling on those menus. They were bonkers. He got special access to the Lucasfilm archives and got to view B roll footage and outakes to find loopable actions for the characters. I worked on the purchase of the droids menu. Trying to make a loopable action of Luke gesturing with one arm, saying ""uncle Owen, how about that one... vague pointing towards R4 droid"" so if you watch it... he like points.... puts his arm down, points again... back and forth. 3po's body came from an outtake, but he was framed with his head out, so I had to roto his head from another shot.... I had to cross dissolve smoke so it could loop too... there was all sorts of weird invisible stuff for each character. Totally frustrating but fun!

The most bonkers stuff I didn't get to work on, but saw Van working on was inside the falcon. When Han walks from the cockpit hallway into the main cabin area where Luke is training with the lightsaber.... that's a medium waist up shot of Han as he's walking. His legs were cut off with that framing. So Van and another artist cut him out, shrunk him down, animated CG legs, then he walks over and sits down in the chair, that's a different wide shot of him sitting... he morphed between the two shots to make one continuous move. It was damned impressive. 

The episode 3 menus, Lucasfilm cut the budget. Plain and simple. Therefore no coolness. &&Season 1 Jaime *was* Prince Charming&&[deleted]&&There should have been donkey strikes back too&&I couldn't tell which things were highlighted or not in the Edge of Tomorrow Blu-ray menus... accidentally clicked on the same special features multiple times.&&Warner Bros used to just play the movie, and if you wanted to access features you use the pop up menu.

At least Universal movies have a reel of clips of the movie, and there are moving menus and whatnot.&&its from 2 Fast 2 Furious ,the sequel to Fast & Furious. Its a really cool or ridiculous thing to name your movie.&&In all fairness, the movie is the joke to car guys. But it's so fun to have a group of guys announce ""ejecto seat cuz!!!!"" Or threaten to install one on their copilots seat.&&everytime a sequel is announced for an unanticipated movie (or sometimes in a joke thread) this joke pops up&&Pretty much! I tend to pick up the ""collectors edition"" or the 2 disc version... then never get round to watching the extras anyway!&&TINY FUCKED A STUMP!&&Another case where pirates won. Copying a dvd usually made those things skippable&&Pressing stop then stop again and then play on the remote *usually* skipped the stuff before the menu for me but I think it also depends on your DVD player.&&Extra material is usually great in movies, but only very high budget movies typically have it nowadays. And trailers before you can start watching the movie you bought is the worst, at least have them as a bonus feature you can select from the menu.&&Loved that movie. You could also hear Rutt and Tuke talking randomly in one of the menus.&&A lot of albums you can buy online now actually do include a digital booklet, I have one for Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, and Taylor Swift. &&I feel like a streaming service that included this stuff would go over well.

It was honestly the strangest company I ever worked for. 

As we having our meeting in the HR office, I kept insisting there was a mix up and if you would just being her in here, we can just get past it. They refused. They would not bring her in since it would disrupt the office work flow. WHAT!??? I am kind of thinking this is a little more important than the office work flow. You're accusing me of something I didn't do. 

This was November 2004. I've had plenty of time to think about it. All I can come up with is someone actually seen me give it to her and it threw up a red flag. It didn't matter what the item was. A married man was giving the receptionist a DVD and it didn't sit well with them. That's why they wouldn't bring her in to the meeting since she wasn't really the one that brought it to their attention.

As a hardware or software manufacturer you were required to respect UOP flags if you wanted to be granted use of the patented CSS system by the DVD Copy Control Association, an organisation made up of a few major studios. CSS was a kind of scrambling DRM; they provided the ability to descramble it, and it was patented, so you couldn't write your own code to do it. Once the policy was in place, you either respected UOP flags (made certain things unskippable) or your software/hardware couldn't support a majority of DVDs out there.

VLC doesn't have to give a shit, because it's made in the EU, where pure software isn't considered patentable (it was decided that algorithms are a form of mathematical method, and you can't patent math, although you can copyright specific implementations). VideoLAN, the organisation that makes VLC, wrote their own totally original code to descramble CSS (libdvdcss) so they don't need a license, and the DVD Copy Control Association can't do anything about that because EU law says ""Well, they wrote their own code, so what if it fulfills the same purpose?""

I fell asleep to this film more times than I'd like to admit &&IMO, I'd say the Deathly Hallows, both parts (yes I'm cheating a little, technically it's two movies but still). 

The thing about Harry Potter is that it *wanted* to be a kids movie when it first came out. Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were undeniably centered towards a younger audience, keeping the glee and campiness center stage. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, in fact it could be seen as good… if not for the later movies in the series.

Prisoner of Azkaban is, aesthetically, a good film. Alfonso Cuaron is a mastermind and I have nothing but respect for his work. That being said, this movie just didn't do much for me. The plot was weighted too much in Harry's *feels* about a character we had never heard of before in the series, as if he was conjured solely to increase the length of the series. The entire story seemed like filler, and the only memorable moment is the twist with (spoilers) Peter Pettigrew, and how Sirius was actually a friend all along. But this still restates my previous point; none of it matters past this movie, except maybe to give Harry someone else to monologue with.

However, for all its flaws that I can see, it does put the series on the right direction - to a grittier, more adult aesthetic. Cuaron changed how we see Harry Potter, and David Yates (who directed the later films) absolutely ran with the material. Once ""Goblet of Fire"" released, it was a string of wins after wins after wins. I don't think I've ever seen a series that holds its quality over this many sequels, let alone *improves* upon it.

So, tl;dr, the films get better as they go along, because they accept that a darker tone is what's best for the films. It takes the worst that can be done by the Wizarding world and gives you hope. It gives you something to root for. It makes the characters *human.*&&I can dig that. In retrospect, you're right; a lot of Prisoner of Azkaban *was* filler. However, I kind of enjoy that about it. It doesn't feel too involved but it's still in there. A lot of it is Harry at Hogwarts and things just happening as they do without much intervention from Voldemort. I know it's not for everybody, but that's my favorite part about it. It's kind of like a window into how the world would be if Voldy wasn't screwing around everywhere

As for the first movies being kids movies, I can understand your beef with the contrast, but the way I look at it, and kind of like the movies follow the audience growing up, in a way. if you're 10 years old watching Sorcerers Stone, that movie is a perfect of serious and light-heartedness. And as you grow up, you want more serious stuff, and the movies (somewhat) gradually become more and more grim. Just by looking at color schemes, you can tell the mood of the movie. SS is like a bowl of candy and DH looks like someone threw up a cookies and cream milkshake. 

On the topic of color, that's the main reason PoA is my favorite. It's a lot of blues and blacks with not a lot of green in there like there was in CoS. 2nd place for me is OotP, a lot of illuminated blues in that one and I personally dig that a lot. In fact, the color pallet for GoF is probably the reason I don't like it that much. It just seems so bleak all of a sudden. Like dull grey with a hint of orange that doesn't have enough light on it. 

But back to the story aspect, I really liked HBP since it was very dark and mysterious. Like the calm before the storm. DH1 felt like it had a lack of direction sometimes, but it still has some mega cool bits in there.

But in summary, the later movies come second the PoA just because they're so goddamn bleak and gray comparatively&&Personally I didn't really enjoy the later movies. I like 1-4 because they're exciting and fun still, but 5-8 don't really do much for me. They seem depressing and drained. I get that that's sort of the point with Voldemort returning to power, but the books never lose their sense of fun despite all the dark stuff going on. I guess compared to their book counterparts most movies won't exactly match up, but the movies just feel sort of disjointed. 

Maybe it's just the characters for me? In the books Ron is always Ron, he grows up but he still feels the same. In the movies Ron goes from being excited and lively in movies 1-4, but turns quite melancholy  in 5-8. 

My favourite movie is probably 3 or 4, 3 because of the awesome music and atmosphere, or 4 because it just feels exciting and international.&&",2017-09-08 02:33:01

The first movie was okay, I guess. It was fun because I loved the characters. The story was weak and at times annoying but I still enjoyed it. 

The second movie was unwatchable, I couldn't get even halfway through it.

I'd like to see another try, but only with a really well-crafted script.&&There's so much angst in this thread. y'all need a hug or something?&&The comments on this thread have me very confused.

Girls don't get to have silly fun on the TV too? Sorry it's not the Sopranos guys. And you don't find SJP hot. it was really well crafted TV and without SATC, Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones very possibly might not have existed.  &&I was pleasantly surprised to see this article move up on reddit, but then I read the top troll comments and was brought back to reality&&I think I'm the only one commenting on this, but I'm really disappointed in the story, the journalism itself. A couple of quotes from SJP and that's pretty much it. No real backstory. No details on why. No investigation. I understand this is not The Hollywood Reporter, but even if you have a length limit, this is crap writing.&&[deleted]&&Y'know, I'm kinda sad about this.

I actually genuinely think the first movie is a great character arc for Carrie and a nice rebuttle to the ""it's all about overpriced shoes and meaningless sex"" argument about the tv show; and for a character who's barely in it they really expand on the consequences of Big's tv personality. The second to me feels like they were paid by Dubai to do an hour-and-half advertisement. They even had [Omid Djalli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi_r1-DNmmwUha3HEk), a great British comedian who plays up the Arab heritage in his standup, and wasted him as an unfunny ""mean guy"" manager. It's like having a cameo with the [President of the United St---](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71HVPfQtJ1s)... Oh yeah. 

The series definitely didn't *need* a third movie (or a second, heck you could make an argument that the first was too much) but it *was* good for [non-absurd comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIBpn5ob60s) (you can only go so long watching shows where the jokes are completely out-of-context one liners or ""you think that's bad, remember when..."", or just don't come from the *character* but the *writer*). 

IMVHO, we're sorely lacking character comedies. Every comedic movie coming out is either cashing in on the ""random"" trend (Deadpool, Sausage Party, Hitman's Bodyguard), is a red-text-on-white-background movie, or a complete comedy graveyard. How many of you guys remember the characters *name* in the last pure-comedy movie you went to see? IDK, I know a SatC 3 wouldn't be fantastic, but I just wish there was a move towards that kind of comedy.&&I'm currently binge rewatching the entire series. 

It's fucking great. 

Great writing, funny, relatable in equatable ways. 
Really is one of the best shows about nothing ever done. 

The first movie was a great send off and should have ended the series.

But they had to go ahead and give her a fairytale ending.&&I don't think enough can be said about the impact this show has had on women during its run, and still since. I think it's helped women cultivate close friendships with their girl friends, I think it's given women permission to be free with their sexuality and to talk about it openly with their pals, I think it's given EVERY woman who is approaching 30 (or past it!) a renewed sense that they can STILL be sexy and fun and successful.

I really enjoyed the first movie. It was a great wrap-up of storylines and the second one, while not good, is still fun to watch as a guilty pleasure. 

Personally, I'd love to see a third one that deals more with aging and coming to terms with that as a woman in a world where (case in point - this post) aging women are seen as undesirable when compared to men of the same age.

For comparison, we can look at the folks behind *Game of Thrones*, who are perhaps among the most efficient production team working today.  As of season 6, GoT [reportedly had a production budget of $10 million per episode.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2016/04/22/game-of-thrones-season-6-costs-10-million-per-episode-has-biggest-battle-scene-ever/#4ce62aa211bb)  That was $100 million for the entire season, which had at least one large-scale battle, a long list of important characters, tons of extras, VFX dragons and other magical creatures, elaborate sets, expensive props & costumes, and everything else needed to make viewers feel like what they're watching is taking place in a fantasy world.  

What the shit did *Sex and the City 2* have to justify a $100 budget?  Did Sarah Jessica Parker ride a dragon?  Does it really cost that much to film 4 rich characters complain about their lives?&&So... Maybe someone can explain this to me. Ive never understood how movies that make nearly 3 times their budget are considered to have bombed?

I don't think he meant to insult Kristin or me, but it came out sounding so funny!&&Yes I am right with you. I didn't mind the dialogue and selfishness of the characters when it was a show (kind of like Seinfeld but not as deliberate), but that second movie was just horrendous. Even my wife was like ""turn it off"" after 45 minutes. Maybe it was just the times changing, or it just became that obvious a cashgrab and free clothes for the actresses. &&I never watched any of it, but happened to watch the second movie one day with my girlfriend. Not only is it bad, but I found it extremely offensive. 

Now I’m not one to be offended by much, but as I was watching, especially towards the end, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I can’t believe they got away with it being so offensive and insensitive.&&I was a casual viewer of the show and it was definitely good. I only caught parts of the movies and they were painful. I don't know if the movies were written by the same people  but it was unrecognizable.

 &&I think in that 2nd film the characters were involved in a bit more 'hi jinx' and capers which was kind of out of sync with the regular show &&I think it was just in the series and the film, the problems they had were real problems, even if they were problems that came from a very privileged place. They may have been wealthy but they worked hard to be wealthy and their relationships were not perfect, even though they were wealthy. It was real discussions like the conflict between wanting to be an independent woman but still wanting to find romantic love or the draw between career and family. The second film was filled with problems that were exposed for their inanity due to the longer running time. &&You didn't like the scene where the natives save the girls and surprise, under their burqas they're all wearing obscenely expensive designer dresses?

God that movie was awful.&&Oh shit, yeah, I forgot the cultural offensiveness altogether.  &&Yeah, same here. I'm pretty much one for offensive humour. This wasn't humour, just offensive&&Classic Kermode!&&Hello to Jason Isaacs!&&TTOF&&[deleted]&&Entourage rant: https://youtu.be/mfgCZ9lgQ3I&&> Entourage

Thank you, I really like this Kermode fella.&&I think my fav is his little man rant. I almost fell out of my chair when he called it evil.&&As my wife put it, ""How empowering. A show about women being as vain, promiscuous, and shallow as men at their worst.""&&I grew up watching Golden Girls and Designing Women, but in my 20s I watched Sex and the City with my girlfriend, went to both movies on opening night, and have watched the series through a couple of more times.

While I don't think it holds up ten years later either politically, culturally or socially, for a brief moment in time it was a pretty good show.

To be fair, though, Sex and the City is a gay man's fantasy about what it is like to be an upper-middle-class woman in the big city.&&I'm 39 and always loved Golden Girls. It recently came to Hulu and my 14-year-old son is hooked too. It just goes to show that good writers and good actors working together to make relatable characters can sell anything to anybody.&&Straight dude here. I liked Golden Girls when I was a kid and it was actually running.  I've not revisited it as an adult, but I still fondly remember all the characters.

Thought Sex and the City was uninteresting.&&I watched SatC with my wife in my mid 20s, it was pretty good for the most part.

I wouldn't watch it without her, but I also didn't think it was garbage.

Harry is the best character&&28 straight male here and I can definitely sit down all day and watch Golden Girls still. Maybe because it was a really good show, or the nostalgia of my childhood when my mom or grandmother turned on Golden Girls reruns and I sitting there with my orange juice and goldfish crackers. 


&&Because GG is hilarious, well-acted, and represented some of the best in the sitcom genre. &&Im 33 now and I didn't mind sex and the city. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it, but if my girl put it on I could enjoy it. &&I know straight dudes that enjoyed Sex and the City since they were introduced by their girlfriends and ended up enjoying it. So you never know!&&I am one of the few straight dudes that watched SatC. I was out of work for a few months and was hanging out at my GFs apartment when I found her DVD collection of the series. In a fit of boredom  I put the first disc in and ended up watching the entire run of the series straight through. It might have been the first time I binge watched a show.  

Its a well written show that had the possibility of some nudity every episode. It was perfect distraction from the dullness of my life at the time. 

Aiden was too good for Carrie. She couldn't handle him. &&That would have been my demographic and I liked it. I think I started watching it because of a girl. I kept watching because of the characters. Mostly Charlotte.&&I was in that demographic when that SaTC was still airing and I liked it.  I'm a cross between Samantha and Charlotte.&&I married that man, my husband loves that show, and Sarah Jessica Parker in particular. He goes so far as to tell me I look like her, and genuinely means it as a compliment of the highest order, bless him.&&I know more Sex and the City trivia than any woman or gay man I've ever met. It captured 90's New York better than any show except Seinfeld, and paved the way for a lot of other (lesser) shows.

The movies were a travesty.&&21 straight male. I enjoy Sex and the City. I haven't seen it all. But I laugh whenever I do watch it&&I'm a straight dude and I LOVE sex and the city. I was like 15 or 16 when i started watch it right after it ended airing. &&My boyfriend watches S&tC with me. Is he the only one? It's a good show in my opinion! &&hey now!  straight male. lived in NYC. the first three seasons of SATC were TV gold. sure the girls were proxies for gay male life in NYC but that's kind of what made it work too. Once Darren Star left it became the SJP show.&&This has to be a generational thing.  I know plenty of 30 something guys who enjoyed watching the show with their SOs when they were in their 20s. &&I was in that age group when the show came out and I loved it.  I imagine there are literally dozens of us!&&I'm pretty sure this is Deadpool, dude.&&♫ *Amelia Earhart flew alot of airplanes, except for that one time when she didn't come back.* ♫&&This review might as well apply to the entire fucking series. 

My wife watches it, and I'll catch glimpses of it or hear sound bites from it, and the whole show makes my spine crawl. NONE of these women should be friends with each other to start with. There's absolute zero chemistry in the dialog between them. They literally sit around and talk about their sex and boy problems like shallow high school girls who will never talk to each other again when they graduate high school. There is nothing of substance to their relationships with each other.

Whoever Kim Cattrall's character is, is insufferable. She's the most sex obsessed of the four of them and every single time I've caught dialog with her in it, she sounds like a door to door saleswoman trying to sell sex techniques and/or just brag about sex. None of her interactions with the others sound at all genuine. I don't know if she's just a fucking horrible actress, or her character was deliberately written to have exactly 1 dimension, but god damnit she's insufferable.

And the worst. The fucking worst of the worst, is Sarah Jessica Parker's character's inner monologues. Holy fucking shit I've never heard more vapid ass bile in my life. Her ""thoughts"" and ""insights"" are about as deep as those coming from someone half her age. Literally everything she says is /r/im14andthisisdeep. Everything.

&&Oh man, I really enjoyed that. I love how he so eloquently explained everything. Funny stuff. &&Quite possibly the worst movie I had ever seen in a theater until I took my kids to *The Emoji Movie.*&&Ok can I ask everyone to please stop saying ""oh no"" in the courtroom? Cause the fucking Kool Aid guy is just gonna keep showing up!&&Hello again, friend of a friend...&&(tears) ""bye mum, I love you. I'm gay""&&Good bot.&&A gay a day keeps the children away.&&Yeah, the show was great, a cultural phenomenon even, and the first movie was well made and entertaining. With that said, the 2nd movie was horrible crap. Still, I find it funny how Reddit's main demographic of 18-25 males fail to understand that a show that debuted in the 90's written by gay men about the relationships of fashion obsessed 30-something women wasn't made for them. &&Agreed. It all went down hill when it started to be more about fashion  and less about modern relationships and city life. The first episodes are surprisingly raunchy and edgy and a lot more interesting than shoes, bags and dresses...&& I remember when I first watched all of the seasons I love Carrie and thought Miranda was the worst character. 

 I watch them all again and realized actually that the roles are reversed and Miranda ended up being the most levelheaded the best character of them all.

Carrie fucking sucks &&I always thought Big could have done way better...I was never totally clear on what actually connected those two, Carrie is annoying as fuck to be honest and reminds me of girlfriends I had back when I was around 20 years old, yet she's like 30 and still hasn't grown up? Meantime one the girls I'm thinking of was pretty awful at 20, and now by 30 she's running an art gallery full time and really turned into quite a whole person.

Like what is Carrie ""about""? I can't even think of anything to describe what her qualities actually are or what she enjoys in life. She has no real hobbies, no real skills aside from writing, I mean she's just a completely stunted human. Interests: Shoes, Cosmo martinis, New York City, Shopping. Hobbies: ?.&&Yeah they were both horrible people and I would have been really disappointed with a *Carrie sees the light* and ends up single ending.

That's just not reality. She's someone who needed male attention and validation. That was never going to change so the ending, while not terribly helpful in terms of women's lib, was what probably *would* have happened in real life.&&Same. I really enjoyed the show, but would have liked it more if it didn't romanticize Carrie's personality faults so much. I like my characters to have faults, sure, but I don't need them to be held up on a pedestal.

Then again, the story was from her POV. I can see why it was done that way. Still irritates me, though.&&It was like the prototype of How I Met Your Mother with Ted.&&God daaaaaammmnn&&Damn!&&#Confirmed. Savage strike successfull.

^^with ^^Patty ^^Schwartz&&I didn't pay any attention, and just assumed it was set in and shot there paid by Dubai as an ad for tourism/business development.  I'm seriously surprised.&&Also women drinking alcohol and having permiscuious sex is a no go in UAE.  It's like just because the UAE has money everyone forgets the fact that they're Muslim.

NYC is not just a setting. It is very much a main character as much as the 4 women.  It was very important that they filmed the series and the first movie in NYC. Filming it elsewhere is akin to replacing sjp with a stand in,  As shown by the poor box office performance of the second movie.


Edit: a lot of people replying don't seem to realize that satc is not just about the human characters. It is very much a show about the vibes and culture of NYC in the 90s to early 2000s. Many NYC businesses and institutions, both famous iconic ones as well as small mom n pop shops like magnolia bakery were featured prominently throughout the series. So filming it at another location like Atlanta or Toronto and pretend it is NYC simply won't work.  &&Battle: Los Angeles was filmed in Louisiana for the same reasons (aside from a handful of scenes filmed in San Diego), lol.

Carrie wrote a column a week of very mediocre self-indulgent material and somehow had a Manhattan apartment to herself on what she earned from it.

She sure wasn't paying for that place she lived in with Kyle MacLachlan with her take-home from the part-time docenting .&&The part where Samantha(?) spills her purse and bunch of condoms fly out, and she screams ""Yeah, they're CONDOMS!"" 
Like, hahaha Samantha is just so outrageous!
God that movie was awful.

Every other character felt like they had some motivation or personal characteristic that, maybe I didn't enjoy them, but I sort of understood what made them that way.  Parker's character was just a spoiled, rich bitch... fine as a side character who is supposed to come off that way, but mother of God, she was supposed to be the protagonist you empathized with.&&Sex and the City or Golden Girls?
&&[deleted]&&Is that the new Bravo tagline?  I feel like Cohen's Housewives series is mostly him just working out his silent rage at those women by letting themselves be comfortably dumb, petty without them even realizing it.&&It's a show about urban women acting like gay men.&&The “gay husband” stuff was especially messed up. &&I never hear yall bitchin about Seinfeld or IASIP.&&I agree - they weren't people I ever aspired to be, and certainly they weren't portrayed as flawed but as a pinnacle of womanhood - but it was refreshing to see female characters engaging with female characters talking about female issues.  I think it's easy to forget in hindsight how few female centric tv shows there were at the time. &&I'm gonna say just upper class. That show was all about wealth porn.&&So much this, the comparison between GG and Sex and the City is apples and oranges. One show acted as though they were providing entertainment, and the other just lived out cliché fantasies.&&My girlfriend got the idea to marathon the show last year, and I was usually in the room half watching half reading or fucking around on the internet. I actually didn't mind it. Then again, less than a year before that I sat through every episode of Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman, so maybe it was a relative thing. &&Same. I started watching it with my mom and laughed at what I understood. As I got older, the jokes got funnier and I picked up on a lot more of what was going on in the show. About 10 years after that, saw it again with some people, and it still held up. 

Fuck that show was really amazing.&&It's on Hulu, FYI.&&I loved when Harry was introduced. Him & Steve were always my favorites. Samantha had some pretty hilarious moments too. &&Same. I even liked the first movie. The second was unwatchable though.&&I'm in my mid-20s and currently watching it with my girlfriend. Feel the exact same way. Not something I'd watch alone but it's a pretty good show.

Also, Anthony, the gay fashion/wedding designer is the best. Harry pulls a close second.&&Harry is my favorite guy in the show. I definitely want a husband like him way more than any of the other guys. He is genuine, funny, and really loves Charlotte. Also I didn't get the whole thing with bashing on his looks. I mean sure he isn't Kyle McLachlan but the man isn't actually ugly. He has a decent face and it looks like he is in shape. Being a well to do lawyer also doesn't hurt. 

What I don't get is Big. What a dickhole. I guess he and Carrie deserve each other. &&This hits home. 24 straight male, my mom would constantly watch reruns on lifetime and I'd laugh along with her. &&Gotta love DP&&AND THEN THERE'S MAUDE! &&Don't forget: living in NYC means being in a perpetual state of dining at $100 min bill restaurants and drinking at brand new clubs.&&His review of the Entourage movie is also a joy to behold.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv5fYWy3H9Q&&Motion to switch to saying ""vagina""&&/R/unexpectedScottPilgrim&&Thanks!

I also think it gave me a greater appreciation for the female perspective of sexuality. &&Yeah, this whole post just screams: ""Look! This thing we all hate failed!  Don't you all feel good now?""&&Reddit stereotypes aside, I am slightly confused as to why the comments in this thread are so aggressive. What did Sex and the City *do* to these guys? &&I reluctantly started watching this at my wife's request, and it was a very enjoyable show.

But I didn't like the movie.  At all.

She deserves a lot better.&&Carrie ""sucks"" sometimes but that's why I love the writing of the show. She reminds me of my friends - women who I love but who sometimes do bad or annoying things.

Yep. Shows like Friends and Seinfeld that took place in NYC but didn't actually film there are jarring to watch once you've been to/lived in New York. Whereas modern shows like 30 Rock, Girls, Broad City, Law & Order/SVU, etc. that are filmed on location feel much more genuine and the NYC setting is integral to the story and characterization. I've been watching a lot of [Cracked After Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1BQ3bbJO_k&t=7m45s), and they mention that Friends never actually addressed 9/11 except to change their stock footage of the skyline. Stuff like that just made the show super detached from the real world.&&I can see why they thought talking the girls out of their city would make for a fresh and fun story. But, that would a good episode. Not a good closed ended story. It really does need to be in the city. Although I'd watch a version where they stuck in NJ for the night. &&Ay oats ain't cheap&& That's what Sigourney Weaver got for Alien Ressurection. It was the going rate fuck your franchise without me cash grab.&&One, but it needs to be super nice.&&True! But I did feel like Charlotte in the tv show was 'old money'. So while she didn't work for her money like say Samantha (she still was an art curator), her wealth was never offensive like it was in the movies. Charlotte in the TV series would have never felt oppressed or cried that her child stained her 'vintage skirt'. She tried so hard for a baby, she wouldn't have cared what they did. The second movie was just disastrous for every character. I pretend it doesn't exist. &&I hate that scene! It's such a blotch on an otherwise flawless character.

If Kim Cattrall really wasn't interested in this 3rd go around - I don't blame her. Her story for the 2nd movie was 'I have the menopause!!!', 'Hot flushes in a hot place!!!' and a walking joke for 'look at all the pills I take to combat my MENOPAUSE!!!'. She was turned into a very bad gag/caricature. Horrendous, given her amazing development on the TV show. &&Bridesmaids (as much as I disliked it) has to be acknowledged as one of the best (or at least better ones) in it's genre. 

For me it stands to Sex and the City like Pacific Rim to Transformers. &&[deleted]&&Carrie definitely wasn't rich, she just spent money like she was. There was a whole storyline about her being broke and Sam and Miranda (who were responsible and successful) offered to loan her 30 grand for a down payment for her apartment. She ended up bullying Charlotte to give her her tiffany engagement ring from a failed marriage instead.&&The Carrie character was the centre piece but the most incredibly self centered.

Someone could be talking about chemo and their hair falling out and she'd find a way to bring it around to needing to get her hair done!

Every conversation ultimately comes back to her and 'Big'. 

Her man needs to be insanely wealthy and work in finance but also appreciate art and buy her thoughtful gifts 'just because'&&Heh, you just described how I felt about Orange is the New Black Season 1.  Thankfully, they fixed it.&&I occasionally watched it. This was still the time when I watched things on TV just because they were on TV, when it was normal that you just watch what's on. (Haven't watched TV for several years, and that kind of mentality seems weird now.) But I really liked Samantha. Not just because she was hot (EDIT: she did induce some .. phantasies into my teenage self), but also because she was so outgoing, open, and happy with herself and her sexuality. Also, because she evidently had a good heart. My dream woman.&&sex and the city.

GG was always presented with humility, generosity, and a sympathetic view to all the characters involved. even dorothy's ex husband, the cad that he was, was portrayed as a lovable loser.

 &&What a yutz. &&Golden Girls all the way &&I am Samantha/Maranda kind of a guy.  A 36 year old gay guy.   &&Each one of the different Housewives series has something equally dumb that Cohen stokes for views and then acts like either like a gay Steve Harvey or some holier-than-thou figure at the reunion&&Wait who had a gay husband?&&People need to hate on something I guess

It's just a show, it's not about empowering anyone.&&Also straight dude, also used to watch with grandma as a kid. Also thought it was good and didn't like Sex In the City. 

GG is still in syndication, on Hallmark or Ion or one of those. Saw a couple of episodes, probably last year. Sitcoms aren't really my thing anymore, but it holds up.&&Fun Fact:  Mitchell Hurwitz (Creator of Arrested Development) was a writer for the Golden Girls.&&The only characters i dislike were Charlotte and sometimes Stanford 

My wife's been watching it again lately and I see it while I play games on my PC, and Steve is kind of an asshole a lot of the time. I still like him, but he's such a douche to Miranda.

Charlotte does have one of the funniest jokes on the whole series though. The Mrs Up-The-Butt home from the first season (maybe first episode) was hilarious&&31 here, love GG. It's my mom's all time fave show. I got her GG Funko POPs for her birthday and wanted to keep em for myself so bad lol. It really is a good show. &&Sweet I'll bring the lube you bring the homie.&&That was an ordeal.&&Oh come on! &&More facts please&&Teenage me watched it for sex scenes. Older me realizes it doesn't relate to me at all. Teenage me reeeeeaaally enjoyed it though.&&Watching that show as a teenager taught me a lot about women's sexuality as well. It wasn't super in depth but it helped me to appreciate their feelings and wants more because I saw a show where adult women spoke candidly about what they liked or didn't like in bed.&&That's most of Reddit these days.&&Can't speak for everyone, but in my humble opinion the second movie was a slap in the face. No city, Culturally insensitive, silly, zero depth. Even the 1st one destroyed all the progress the characters made, Steve cheats, Miranda is back to being a high strung biatch, Samantha is selfish and still incapable of love, Big is a jerk. These characters came a long way and they couldn't think of anything better than having them revert? Utter CRAP. &&It's just typical Reddit macho posturing in the easiest way possible. Everyone needs to know just how manly and heterosexual they are even though they don't actually do anything masculine that requires leaving an arm chair &&I'm confused by all the men shitting on it and then saying they'd marry Charlotte. Charlotte is sweet but she has incredibly high standards and could be pretty condescending about them. ""Omg he grabs his balls all the time!"" Well you could ask him if he's aware it's happening. ""Your tiki shirt isn't classy enough, take it off! Ew your back is hairy which is ao much worse, put it back on!"" ""My pregnant dog peed on the carpet in the middle of the night, I can't even look at her!""&&I can see how it would be offensive to sexually frustrated young men to see women open and honest about their sex lives and criticisms of men. They'd prefer older women that more closely resemble an ideal motherly figure: pure, nonjudgmental, encouraging. It's indicative of an immature and inexperienced perception of the opposite sex.&&Personally I ended up having to watch it 3 times. First time was ok, watched with some friends. Second time was on a plane, before all the seats had personal screens, so I didn't have anything better to do. Third time was on a *different* plane, was so sick of the movie by this point it just pissed me off, but I have a hard time not watching a tv if it's in front of me.

The film industry is now dead here and ATL is reaping all the benefits. The days of not having to drive 7 hours to shoot for 3 days was pretty nice&&And it’s bringing a lot of business to the Atlanta suburbs as well! I’m from a small town north of ATL and quite a few have shot here (Mockingjay 2, GOTG 2 off the top of my head) and a bunch of small businesses and restaurants have thrived because of the cast and crews and whatnot. &&It would have been really weird if Friends addressed 9/11 though. And inappropriate, people watch it for escapism&&They didn't address 9/11 directly because it was too fresh. It would have exploited the trauma of the event, and as someone else said, people watched it for escapism. It wouldn't have fit the tone of the show at all.

But Rachel and Joey (I think) did wear FDNY and NYPD shirts in a couple of episodes afterwards, in order to pay a subtle tribute. &&So true, especially for Broad City. Watching that show is like being in the city. They did an entire episode on St Marks and the nostalgia was killing me T_T&&They did the Hamptons episodes, the LA episodes, that one where they went to the casino, the whole arc of Miranda moving to Brooklyn, and the last two episodes in Paris. I think they did the whole ""New York gals are somewhere that isn't New York"" enough in the show. They also did Sam in LA in the first movie.&&This was the episode that made me realize that Carrie is truly a piece of shit. &&30 grand for a down payment for a NYC apartment. buwahahahaha&&I can't believe I know this, but she wasn't broke, she just got into a situation where she had to buy out her apartment, or she would have lost it. If you don't plan for it - you usually don't have 30 grand lying around. &&That's... kind of the whole point when Orange is the New Black starts out though. Rich priveleged white girl thrown into prison and entirely out of her element.&&Plus they touched on subjects that were fairly taboo at the time as well.

While I was never an avid fan of the show, I grew up watching it in the background at my grandparents house as a kid in the late 80s/early 90s.  I’ve seen a few reruns since then, and it’s always enjoyable. &&[deleted]&&37yo straight guy, Samantha all day.&&[deleted]&&They would have a “gay best friend” or what they called a “gay husband” because *every* woman should have one and it’s totally not exploitative and stereotyping in any way!&&Ross.&&There weren't too many shows that had women as leads and talking about sex and 'what they want'

Many leopards are killed each year for their fur and body parts and this is one reason why the leopard is an endangered animal.

And then a few scenes later she's actually being a really good friend to someone, or really trying to support some cause, or whatever. I couldn't decide with her or with Laura Dern on whether I liked them or not and it was honestly a JOY for me because, again, that's what real people are like!

With a large closet.&&I guess it depends on your idea of ""broke"" but she had I think 700 bucks in her chequing account and no savings or assets, which seems pretty broke for NYC and considering the way she spent money.

Daisy Ridley is the only one that doesn't have an award, but what's her acting career been so far outside of Star Wars? &&Josh Gad was both Olaf in *Frozen* (massive smash hit) and Elder Cunningham in *The Book of Mormon* (massive smash hit). Don't write him off so easily.&&And to be fair, a Tony is practically an Oscar, just Tony's are for stage performances and Oscars are for film.  In my mind they are definitely comparable.  Maybe the stage skills don't quiiiite translate over to film well for some people, but there are plenty of top notch actors that do both stage and film productions.  &&I meant that's how it looks if you just glance at the poster&&> only widely resonating Broadway musical for the century so far

While she did a good job, you can't say the fact that it's Star Wars didn't have anything to do with it, if not most of the credit here.

Should I watch it beforehand?&&I watched the Adventure Time adaptation, will my viewing be ruined?&&Actually, it's Belgian...&&I thought the same thing when I saw the trailer but I have since listened to the audiobook and I have to say it's kind of out of context.

Totally full of himself.&&""Oi, mounsieur, Poirot is much too clever for the likes of you.""&&Dame* right&&[Such a classic into...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvrj5E_elzg)

As a kid I always thought the weird art styling were those [energy shields from Dune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkQFhPJuxgk). Then I got older and realized that a badass like Poirot doesn't need silly things like energy shields to stop evil.&&Sadly you're right. Out of all the episodes of Poirot David Suchet has ever done it was the weakest. He was also strangely religious in that one too (never read the book as I can't compare it to the source).

Thankfully Mr. Suchet made up for this with 'Curtain: Poirot's Last Case' which I felt was one of the best episodes he's ever done.&&I really liked it. Bit different from the book, but he acted his ass off as always. Really liked how gloomy it was. But yeah, remaking anything poirot now seems kinda stupid. Suchet was absolutely perfect as poirot.&&Apparently David Suchet insisted the story be changed to reflect his religiousness (he converted to Christianity). It starts creeping in noticeably over the years.&&Oh sure, sir&&Oh sure, sir&&I'm curious to hear Suchet's response to the film, though his public statement is likely to be gracious and supportive.&&Ze little grey cells will be most entertained, non?&&no spoilers&&Thanks for the input. I am genuinely curious how people feel about this. 

I like the 1974 version, mostly because I love Lauren Bacall and Anthony Perkins and Ingrid Bergman (who won a too-late Academy Award for it). I had never read it so the twist was a surprise for me. 

I just assume the audience for this is going to be people who've read the book or seen the movie, which would spoil the story in my mind at least. 

This story more than any other murder mystery I can think of relies on the surprise of who did it. &&I'm a millennial, but perhaps you're right and the twist is not nearly as well-known as I thought. 

It only seemed so crazy to me because, for me, the story doesn't have a ton of replay value when you know the ending. But perhaps I'm in the minority there. &&Since the first Pirates of the Caribbean all his movie performances have been vapid and lackluster.  It's as if he's taken lessons from Adam Sandler where making a funny voice equates to acting.

Maybe he could take some serious roles, or comedy roles where he uses his own face and voice?   Maybe be in a sci-fi movie.   Or a Marvel Movie.&&Not sure about everyone else but he was a total cunt when he came to Australia. Violated our quarantine laws regarding bring pets into the country and then posted a pathetic apology video only after he coped a lot of shit. 

He's still a fine actor but I've just lost respect for him. &&That's definitely a subjective view. It's a  debate I'm not gonna win on Reddit, but I like the guy.&&He's done a lot of movies and most were great. Sweeney Todd, Public Enemies, Rango, 22 Jumpstreet (beautiful cameo),  Black Mass (best performance in years), Art of the Deal (second best performance 😉) and in Tusk as Guy freaking LuPointe.

Sure people have gotten tired of his Jack Sparrow and Tim Burton schtick. But dude is mad talented.&&The mustache was a huge defining feature of Hercule Poirot. Every Agatha Christie book he was in the mustache always seemed to get brought up. &&Yeah, the use of modern music in the trailer is unfortunate.  &&Im just holding out hope in Kenneth Branagh at this point. &&Well, Imagine Dragons would mostly be the fault of the marketing department, and about Johnny Depp's character... let's just say there isn't much to be worried about performance-wise&&[removed]&&To be fair, Black Mass was good.&&On the bright side, if this one sucks, the original is still excellent.&&I actually liked the Imagine Dragons song for the trailer.  It was more of a teaser than anything so I thought it was a cool, stylish choice.  But I can understand why some wouldn't be crazy about it.&&I used to love Johnny Depp but his movies recently have dwindled that. I don't get as excited for his movies like I used to, I'm hoping this will turn things around for me. &&the music was really offputting for me&&Left or right?&&Would that be a poisonous Ethiopian caterpillar?&&Winner of the coveted Chinese crying monkey award&&""I've been a bad, bad boy, Father.""&&I think it annoys the Academy to have their awards placed implicitly equal to other awards on promotional materials (it lowers the apparent prestige of the Oscar).

I like Branagh's work generally, and I like a lot of the cast, but my first thought when I saw that Depp is in it was that he was a concession Branagh had to make to get the film made. I earnestly hope that Depp dials down his performance for this role - or that the editor has enough options that s/he can piece together a good performance.&&With the number of weirdos and demon/undead things he plays, him being killed doesn't mean much...&&^ Please follow the instructions for spoiler text. 

&&It certainly doesn't need to be remade and I personally would have been fine if it never was. Still, the story is a good one and there are generations of people that never *will* see the '74 version so fine, make a modern version and see what happens.

&&Same with the sci-fi looking rail thing on the ceiling. And the electronic-looking thing the rails end at in the back. Are they on a space train? (maybe that's just the blue light though)&&I think that the Hercule Poirot show that ran from 1990-2014ish got the vibe perfect. Obviously it changes between those years as filming became more HD and budgets became bigger but they really captured a consistent and elegant style.

And it was post-Victorian instead of noir, this story is set in the late 30s I believe or early 40s.&&It's bold, similar to how The Great Gatsby was done, and there's a good chance that fans will enjoy the modern vibes it brings.

I haven't looked into it but what if the film is modern day but the characters are doing some period-acting thing in keeping with the history of the train, kind of like a murder-mystery party that turns into a real murder mystery?&&Then poor Daisy would seem like garbage.&&and frozen.&&She shows up as a corpse in a tv show I think. &&I... didn't even know he'd been nominated.

edit: nvm, been reading his wiki page. And wow, this guy is an asshole. Seems that way anyways. I'm still not sure what to think about the domestic abuse allegations, seems like that could go either way. I can believe her exaggerating for the sake of cashing in, but I can also believe that this asshole was an abusive husband. Just perhaps not physically. &&[removed]&&I feel the same. I was especially concerned for a few moments when I read another comment ""starring Johnny Depp and an incredible moustache"" and genuinely thought Johnny Depp was playing Poirot: that would be a hideous casting decision. &&His acting style used to be unique and interesting. Years of roles in his particular style just make him look unimaginative and incapable of acting any differently. It's like watching a copy of a copy of a copy of the same expressions and mannerisms, pasted onto different characters to give them the special vibe we associate with him.

It's not even that this is something that doesn't happen with other actors as well, it's just seriously overhyped in Depp's case.&&He's also an annoying example of someone who is a really terrible abusive person, but his career is not affected at all & people seemed more annoyed at her. Ugh. Still a bit testy about that whole palaver as I used to think he was so cool!&&Mr. E. Mystery. An enigma! E. Nygma! Mr. Edward Nygma!&&I think he has definitely overexposed himself in films lately. My opinion is that he has portrayed a few too many ""quirky"" characters and is in desperate need of a fresh start with a straight character. &&Promo photos almost never take place with multiple actors.  They're all shot separately and composited together.  That allows them artistic expression (and everyone looks their best) at the expense of realism.&&> YouTube removed them all - boo

I've read the book, watch the 1970's movie, listened to this audio book and I'm still looking forward to the new movie even though I know the ending.  I think you'll still be able to enjoy both. &&I would watch the original after. The new version may have a better reveal of the ending. But the original is very well renowned for having been one of the greatest/ most influential films of its time and played a major role in the revolution of twist endings in film.&&Yea, it's not going to be as good as that.&&Yeah, goofy French.&&Well, a lot of people there do speak French.&&I think I've only read three Poirot books but referring to himself as the greatest detective in the world, if not an actual thing he says (I don't recall off the top of my head) is 100% in character.&&Orient Express being one of the most well-known Poirot stories, which already had a bunch of film adaptations, Suchet and the team wanted to give it a completely different feel. It resulted in an episode like no other in the series, leaving the actual investigation (and impressive cast) aside to focus on Poirot's mind. It was pretty weird, but I didn't hate it.&&It's interesting that the Orient Express and the Death on the Nile, the two stories that already had excellent film adaptations, were both done so badly by the Poirot series.

The Orient Express was needlessly angsty and ""dark."" It went completely against the established ideas of the character (in the beginning, we see Poirot terribly shaken by a man committing suicide because of what was found out ; whereas in many stories Poirot stated outright that suicide was a good solution for many culprits, a solution he *hoped* the ones he liked would take and one he actively prevented disliked culprits from taking), and it treated serious moral questions far too simplistically (the horrible initial sequence of stoning an adulteress is supposed to mirror the later events, and Poirot compares the two events on moral grounds... without any thought on whether, perhaps, adultery on one side and child murder on the other make the comparison moot).

Death on the Nile, on the other hand, was too placid and bland - of all the fascinating female characters in that story, for some reason the mousy Cornelia Robson stood out and was fleshed out far more than, say, the temperamental heiress or the crazy stalker lady. The person that should have been the epitome of stolidity and straightforwardness was shady from the start. Etc.  
That one was an immense disappointment.&&I just read the book and I don't think there was a single mention of religion&&Christie wrote that Poirot was Catholic and mentions him going to church at least once.&&He's /u/alexander_karamazov, he's at your service, sir.&&I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service sir&&Oh, I'm sure he'll be most gracious. He knows he's our favourite Belgian of all time. &&I feel like it's a waste of film, the 74 version is excellent.&&I honestly feel like more people would have known the plot in 1974, since Christie was more recent and would have been more widely read.&&I'm a millennial too, but I have to admit that the only reason I read the book was because I heard about the movie.

Also the last few adaptations (film and tv) were out of the UK, so I think Americans are less clued in to it.&&Yeah, but Poirot was bald. He was introduced in Orient Express as having a head that looked like an egg.

It's not like, ""Poirot turned around and accidentally slapped Lady Castlery in the face with his absurdly large mustache."" Branagh's looks absurd in the trailer. &&Exactly.

A Poirot without a godly mustache is not Poirot.&&Yes, and apparently [it got bigger and bigger](http://www.agathachristie.com/characters/hercule-poirot/great-moments-of-poirots-moustache) with each new book.&&Hopefully it won't be the modern-music-in-the-1920's that was the Great Gatsby remake.&&[deleted]&&since they're bringing a big star onboard i'm sure there will be plenty of flashbacks, maybe even ""what if"" flashbacks, as in Clue, while they're juggling different hypotheses&&His acting was good, but the movie itself wasn't particularly good.&&I can certainly understand not being crazy about it, but it's ridiculous how many people seem to be writing the film off entirely because of that alone.

A budding actress just launching her professional career is in no way ""poor"" acting alongside some of the most acclaimed actors currently working.

I hope this goes well for Daisy. She's a very charismatic actress with a lot of stage presence, she deserves to have a career that extends far beyond the star wars franchise.  I'll be very interested to see what sort of range she has&&Cocks.&&That's what happens when Burton keeps casting you lol&&Yeah, but so far it seems like this movie will stay true to both story and period.

Gonna have a bit of a hard time setting it aside when I see the movie. &&Suchet embodies Poirot, he's neat and proper and wears spats!&&Suchet is Poirot and Fry and Laurie are Jeeves and Wooster.&&I remember a line where he was described as having ""a profusion of moustaches"".&&A lot of what people tend to associate with Sherlock Holmes wasn't in the books, if I'm not mistaken.&&I think the hat was in a story or two, but it certainly wasn't a defining feature.&&Wait.  y'all have seen Branagh's Frankenstein, right?  because that movie was a nightmare, and not in a good way. &&Executive Decision pulled that off rather well too.&&More and more, nominations are just for advertising power. There are usually two or three movies that could really feasibly actually get an Oscar and the rest are just so they can keep the machine alive. Now everyone's a NOMINEE!!! NOMINEE FOR BEST DIRECTOR!! COME SEE THIS!&&My name is Alexander Hamitlon, I'm at your service sir.

I have been, looking for you&&[deleted]&&It comes off like scooby doo, with a vibrant color pallet. There are elements of mystery but nothing supernatural. However I'm hoping that changes when Sabrina the teenage witch comes along next season. 

Honestly I recommend riverdale if u like campy dramas. I personally really enjoyed it cause the aesthetic is on point. And the characters, while campy, do feel kinda real. Especially Jughead (Cole Spouse). &&The promo poster did not look that great, but I thought Leto's delivery of this line in the trailer seemed deranged and threatening, and his laugh earlier is probably the best live action Joker laugh I'd ever heard.

The completed scene has weird jump cuts and special effects in it, completely ruined. Not to mention his character in the movie otherwise just doesn't work.&&thanks my friend. the thread where i posted it, one guy said he had his whole office around the computer laughing. its the sort of thing that keeps me wanting to keep sharing my stupid jokes :)&&Australian here who has just recently seen Book of Mormon and hasn't seen Hamilton, after the show we were talking about Hamilton and wondering if it would translate well overseas. Imagining a lot of the history and injokes wouldn't quite fly here where we don't know anywhere near as much about US history.&&What? Dog smuggling? Dogs aren't exactly hard to come by are they?&&""Fuckin REKT him my dude ,"" everybody on Reddit probably &&Isn't it? He is also impressive at a different voice for each of the characters.&&Davis Suchet is to Poirot what Jeremy Brett is to Sherlock Holmes. The gold standard. &&His portrayal of Poirot makes that show, his acting is superb. &&It's like they grew David Suchet in a lab for the sole purpose of playing Poirot.&&it's going to hard for me to see Kenneth Branagh's take on Poirot, since I am so used to David Suchet's version. It's going to take some time for me to get used to the new face of Poirot. Hopefully, the movie does well. &&They should use CGI so that at some point the villain exclaims you aren't even Hercule Poirot! And rips the mask off, revealing Suchet.

Then indeed it is Poirot and case solved.

The end.. &&It is more accurate to say that many aspects aren't as prominent in the books, but they are there. Irene Adler appeared in one story. Moriarty appeared or was mentioned in like three stories, but because one of them was the one where Sherlock Holmes died it is easy to understand why he became more prominent in the mythos.

It is true that he never said 'Elementary, my dear Watson' in the books though.&&Never mentioned [in the text.](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-deerstalker-where-sherlock-holmes-popular-image-came-from-7325976/) An artist used it in a few illustrations. Holmes is mentioned wearing a few different hats (most notably a fez which would be a much better choice for a city detective!). &&[deleted]&&His performance wasn't what was wrong with that movie, in fairness to Branagh. And I actually somewhat enjoyed it. He's just got a penchant for silliness a mile wide s all. &&I'm getting nervous &&I'm confused as to what the show is supossed to be but fuck it ill watch the first episode now.&&Riverdale was a pleasant surprise &&Yeah the poster looked ridiculous and then Leto redeemed his Joker at the end of that trailer and then the movie turned out to be like the poster. That scene is so menacing in the trailer and so butchered and ADD in the film.&&Nah man that Joker is absolute horse shit and a genuine fuck-up of a character that has all the source material in the world to pick from. Especially since we got a proper Batman for once. The laugh sounds forcefully deranged too. Like he's not actually finding anything funny, he's trying to be unsettling, which is just cringey.

 I'd be happy if they just wrote-off this joker completely as the design misfire that it is, or do what most fans think should happen and have him be the Robin that Joker smashed up with a crowbar, with the real Joker out there somewhere

And of course the best live-action laugh: https://youtu.be/r9Jz4xCONAE?t=92&&It wasn't due a shortage of dog supply. He was shooting Pirates 5 in Australia and brought his dogs in on a private jet without going through the formal process. Australia has really intense biosecurity laws (the ecosystem is super vulnerable to introduced species/disease) and they got caught. 

Unfortunately, because Johnny Depp is famous and Australia is a punchline, the ""potential ecological devastation"" angle was overshadowed by the ""cheeky celebrity causes embarrassing incident with simple foreigners"" angle.&&You mean Poirot time traveled to the 90s to play himself in the TV show.

There is no David Suchet, only Poirot.&&Or Joan Hickson's Miss Marple.&&I didn't mind Ustinov's version of Poirot. He captured the vanity and the charm very well. Suchet's version was too angry in the later episodes. &&Honorable mention to Basil Rathbone.&&Absolutely, Brett is the definitive Holmes.   I bought the whole Brett series on blu-ray recently and rewatched most of them.  They were all originally shot on 16mm and the transfers are generally really good.  If, like me, your first watch was on 80s TV or VHS they are worth getting.

Not movies I know but [Clive Merrison's radio productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Merrison#Sherlock_Holmes_on_radio) are fantastic too.&&Basil Rathbone was the ultimate Holmes.&&He was fucking great in Doctor Who too. A tremendous actor in every role he's played. He's most famous for his role as Poirot of course but my parents will rave about his performance on stage at every opportunity.

I shared this recently, I'd imagine it's the kind of thing he'd appreciate others ponder on at this time.

""I'm 87 years old...I only eat so I can smoke and stay alive.. The only fear I have is how long consciousness is gonna hang on after my body goes. I just hope there's nothing. Like there was before I was born. I'm not really into religion, they're all macrocosms of the ego. When man began to think he was a separate person with a separate soul, it created a violent situation.

The void, the concept of nothingness, is terrifying to most people on the planet. And I get anxiety attacks myself. I know the fear of that void. You have to learn to die before you die. You give up, surrender to the void, to nothingness.

Anybody else you've interviewed bring these things up? Hang on, I gotta take this call..... Hey, brother. That's great, man. Yeah, I'm being interviewed... We're talking about nothing. I've got him well-steeped in nothing right now. He's stopped asking questions.""

One of the best character actors in history.&&He really was an incredible actor.  Two of my favorite roles of his that immediately jump to mind were in Alien, and as Roman Grant in Big Love. Rest in peace, Harry.&&Here are some miscalanious HDS facts that I think are pretty interesting:

Roger Ebert famously proclaimed that no movie with either M. Emmet Walsh or Harry Dean Stanton could ever be bad. Debbie Harry of Blondie mentioned him in the song I Want that Man, where she sung ""I want to dance with Harry Dean, Drive through Texas in a black limousine."" He served in the Navy in WW2. He was once roommates with Jack Nicholson. He was a singer and sung mainly Spanish songs. He smoked like a motherfucker into old age. He was in countless films and his career spanned seven decades.

He was a cool guy who lived a cool life.&&He was terrific on the new season of Twin Peaks. RIP, dude.&&Noooooo. RIP Harry Dean Stanton. He looked 91 for about 91 years, so it's no surprise but sad all the same. Brilliant actor. He and Sam Shepard dying not too far apart only feels natural given their collaborations with one another.&&He was incredible in Paris, Texas.&&His performance in *Paris, Texas* (which is one of my favorite films) is amongst the all time greats in my opinion. This really hits home considering how recent this new season of Twin Peaks was, really glad to have been able to watch him be a part of it. I'm probably going to check out *Lucky* in his honor as well once that comes out. RIP&&He was amazing in Alien, even if it wasn't the biggest role.

&&RIP in peace Repo Man dude.&&So many actors from Twin Peaks are passing away. &&I always liked his part in Red Dawn

It's a small part, but it hits hard and steady

""Boys! Avenge Me!  Avenge Me!""

https://youtu.be/W6qWnmb_22s&&[Pour one out for the big homie](https://d2ycltig8jwwee.cloudfront.net/features/None/fullwidth.657e9026.jpg)&&[deleted]&&His role as Molly Ringwald's father in Pretty in Pink will always be a favorite role for me. &&This is not a sad death, he had a great career and seemed to be loved by everyone he worked with over the seven decades he worked.

Most importantly, up until the end he had retained his cognition and didn't have to suffer from a slow dementia death. At 91 that's lucky. Speaking of lucky his last movie came out this year called Lucky. Check it out.&&A Facebook post from a family member of mine today..

Harry Dean Stanton has passed away today at age 91.  I was deeply honored to meet him back in 1994, when his Acura Legend was towed into Beverly Hills Honda and Acura, where I served as an Assistant Service Manager...

A beautiful, and very pregnant young woman appeared, and identified herself as Mr. Stanton's personal assistant...

No...  The baby wasn't Harry's...  Just for the record...

After our Technicians examined the car, we found out that the main engine wiring harness had been chewed through by rats...

Now, Harry lived in one of the canyons in the LA area.  I don't remember which one.  These are teeming with wildlife, and such a situation isn't unknown.
Most of the Hollywood ""anointed ones"" wouldn't interact with a lowly Service Writer, and would send assistants to work out the details of repairs and maintenance on their cars...

I will never forget the phone call I received from him concerning what his assistant had told him...

He said ""What the fuck are you telling my assistant, that my wiring was eaten by a fucking rat?""

I paused for a heartbeat, knowing the phrasing of my answer would either offend, enrage, or amuse him, and said ""Yes, Harry, your wiring harness was eaten by a fucking rat!""

One second, two seconds, then three ticked by, and as I was about to start thinking about updating my resume, my ear was assailed by a burst of hearty laughter...

""Well I'll be fucked!  I gotta see this.  I'm coming down there.""  True to his word, he was there within 30 minutes.

After inspecting the ruined harness, he approved the repairs, which were around $1400.00.  This was quite a sum back in the nineties.   We couldn't just patch it.  The harness was thoroughly destroyed, and it had to be entirely replaced.

I was astonished as well as grateful that he took a personal interest in me, and started asking questions.  I told him a brief history, including the fact I was a musician.  Singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

When I had confided this, his eyes lit up, and he told me ""I got a band!  We play blues, and we're playing at (some club) tonight, and you could bring your guitar and do a set!""

As I had a 60+ hour-per-week-job in one of the most high stress business environments known to OSHA, and was working for my best friend, who was the Service and Parts Director, I had to make the wrenching decision to decline.  In addition to the working hours, I spent a total of 2 and a half hours commuting to and from work every day.  A guy's gotta sleep sometime!

I will never forget how, in a few seconds, over a phone conversation, he had sized me up and apparently, decided I might make a good addition to his ""posse"".  I deeply regret not being able to hang out with, and develop a closer friendship with this amazing man.

He was one of the greatest character actors in the history of cinema, and for all those years since, I have regarded him as a treasured friend...

God rest you Harry Dean Stanton.  I hope we can meet and ""hang out"" again on the other side...&&In The Avengers, there was a [deleted extended scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFjboB7izRk) in which Harry Dean Stanton as a security guard helps Bruce Banner ease his mind about almost killing Scarlett. Joss Whedon said he cast him because nobody could be as accepting as Stanton. RIP to a great one.&&His episode of ""No small parts"" is worth a watch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuHDS5281uw&&There used to be a restaurant in the canyon in LA called Four Oaks. I was there one night with clients and saw Sean Penn at another table. I had a few glasses of wine in me and decided I would go tell him how brilliant he was. But when I went to his table, he wasn't there. Then I saw he was smoking outside with two other guys. I walked right up to him and said, ""Sean, I'm sorry to do this but I just wanted to say, I think you're brilliant"" and I shook his hand. Then I pulled out of my tunnel vision to see the guy standing next to him was Jack Nicholson. So I immediately said, ""You're brilliant too!"" and shook his hand. Then I looked at the last guy. It was Harry Dean. I had to repeat the same line one last time and got to shake all their hands. They were all quite nice despite my lame imposition. &&Early word is that he is phenomenal in Lucky. It comes out two weeks from today. Wonder if he'll be posthumously nominated? &&There's a fair bit of trivia that has come my way, not all of which pops up with a Google search, as the result of having been been raised by a film buff father. FUN FACT. In the 1970's, all across North America, one might encounter in the stall of a gas station bathroom the message: ""For a good time, call Harry Dean Stanton"" followed by his phone number. Years later, he would come to learn the source of this long running prank was Jack Nicholson.&&Lucky will be a sad watching experience&&I just watched Paris, Texas for the first time recently, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Truly remarkable and he was perfect in it. &&*""He was kind of raggedy and wild, and she was very beautiful...""

Paris, Texas is one of my favourite films, and Harry Dean Stanton's performance is just outstanding. He never overplays or emotes too hard, yet you feel so much empathy for him, and his final monologue never feels showy or stagey. 

It's just a guy sitting down, telling you his life story, and it's one of the saddest things I've ever heard.&&My favorite actor and one of the greatest character actors ever. His performance in Paris, Texas should be required viewing&&If y'all want to see one of the all time great leading performances, see Paris, Texas. If you want to see an all time great supporting performance, see literally any other film this man has made. R.I.P.&&The life of a repo man is always intense. &&FUCK&&Probably most famous for his role in Alien, but in my heart Harry is best loved for his part in Repo Man.  No one could have been Bud but Harry.  Like every other movie he was in, he stole every scene. RIP dude.&&Fuck.  This really sucks.  He was my grandfather's cousin and I'd just sent him a letter a couple weeks ago saying how much my whole family enjoys his work.  I doubt he got to read it.  RIP Harry Dean.&&for NYC people: [The Quad is doing a Harry Dean Stanton series this month](https://quadcinema.com/program/also-starring-harry-dean-stanton/)

Try to check out the underrated Straight Time, if you can. Of course, Stanton is great in that.&&Repo Man (1984) is my favorite film of all time and I just watched his latest film [Lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KLLkj84GAo) the other day. Easily the performance of the year. Harry Dean was a beautiful man and incredible fucking actor. R.I.P&&I loved him singing the gospel song in Cool Hand Luke. R.I.P.  &&:( Bye Brett.&&Man smoked cigs his whole life and lived to 91. Defying the odds. He was a great cult actor as well.&&An actor who was really in **everything**. I'm sure everyone has seen at least ONE of his performances just through the sheer amount of work he did. A legend in his own right.

RIP.&&Can't wait for Doug Bensons next round of Last Man Stanton then.&&Now I'm sad.

Repo Man and Paris Texas were two movies that had a huge impact on me as a student in the 1980s.&&statement from David Lynch:

>The great Harry Dean Stanton has left us. There went a great one. There's nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him. And with good reason. He was a great actor (actually beyond great) — and a great human being — so great to be around him!!! You are really going to be missed Harry Dean!!! Loads of love to you wherever you are now!!!

Rest in Peace you soulful Legend! 
&&He was in Cool Hand Luke along with Dennis Hopper.&&You can't say he didn't live a full life. Truly a fascinating actor and person. 

Travis from *Paris, Texas* is without a doubt one of my favorite performances of all time. He goes from communicating so much without speaking a single word to giving one of the greatest monologues in film history. 

Thank you for everything, Mr. Stanton. &&Talented actor, I remember seeing him in Pretty in Pink and One Magic Christmas when it aired on Disney Channel back in the day. Always thought he was on Quantum Leap but that was Dean Stockwell.&&Fellow Kentuckian here and I'm proud to say I share a home with the guy. Alien is my favorite film, ever. I'm...stupidly obsessed.

Alien is his first performance that springs to mind for me, but he's been in films I've enjoyed from every decade since the 1950s, even if he just had small roles in them, it's always a good sign when you see his name in the credits.

He just seemed like a cool guy too, a gifted actor and a proper dude. RIP.&&What a man so sad. His role as Travis in Paris,Texas is one the best performances in the history of cinema.

Joss explains how that happened.](http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2012/05/02/joss-whedon-explains-why-harry-dean-stanton-got-to-see-mark-ruffalo-naked-i)&&He was such a great character actor, but this will always be my favorite role of his. He's got that grizzled, space-trucker, I don't give a shit about anything but my paycheck --
 vibe nailed to a T. &&He's the first actor from Alien to pass away :(

I feel like an era is starting to come to a close...

Edit: Forgot about John Hurt.&&Just got me thinking of John Hurt who also died this year.&&""Look at those assholes, ordinary fucking people. I hate 'em.""

He was the best part of Repo Man. :(&&Repo Man was his greatest role. He killed in that. That's how I will always remember HDS. &&>  Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore.&&""Let me buy you a drink""&&Repo man's always intense!&&It's really sad, and yet incredibly poetic in going with, what I believe was one of the central themes of the season. Age. Loss. Life passing by.&&They should rush through approval for a 4th season so we don't risk losing any more. &&They're just visiting the White Lodge. &&""We can't afford to be crying anymore now. I don't want either of you to cry for me ever again. Don't ever do it. Not as long as you live.""&&This is the first thing I think of when I people talk about HDS&&Well, that breaks my heart as much in text as much as it does on screen. Fine actor. &&Absolutely right... fuck that was an intense scene and he nailed it.  Made the movie that much more better.&&Tom Skerritt is 84...&&I'd forgotten about John Hurt... Damn.

In my head it was the android/Bilbo guy who had passed.&&Tom Skerritt's life insurance premiums just went up.&&This, right here. I don't know  Why this isn't receiving more commentary in this thread. His portrayal of Andy's dad was very raw and real, not at all falling victim to the fake or cartoonish or clueless parent trope that was so common in movies in the eighties. He was very vulnerable, and nailed it, playing a great compliment to Miss Ringwald's also very good performance.&&I totally agree with you. I honestly think he's one of the greatest character actors of all time and will be remembered fondly for years to come. 

I still haven't watched the new season of Twin Peaks, but I think that this weekend will be perfect to start binging it. I also can't wait to watch Lucky. I heard Mr. Stanton was excellent in both.

It's from a YouTube channel called No Small Parts, which does these little documentaries about great character actors, going over all the different roles each one has had through their career, kinda analyzes their style, and gives some biographical information about their personal lives. Incredibly interesting and well made.&&Would love that.&&I watched it at a film festival. It's a character study and he does an amazing job. Definitely deserves an Oscar nom.&&I was able to watch it a few weeks ago thinking he passed away earlier this year. I found out the next day he was still alive. This has been a rollercoaster.&&Just saw it the other night.  It's a whole film about fear of death and accepting our limited time on this planet.

It'll be a damn tough watch now.&&Watched it for the first time last year and still think about it from time to time and find myself welling up.&&He was 91.  ""Oh death, why must you pick the freshest fruit from the vine?  Why can't you allow it to ripen just a bit?""&&right.&&I often wonder if the body gets used to it and only after you quit smoking the cells become cancerous. This guy was a major smoker. Everyone I've ever known who died of cancer it was after they quit. I know I'll get downvoted. That's ok.&&I stopped listening a year or two ago. I was getting tired of the guests I didn't care about and Doug was getting more and more pissy. I had read that he since gone off on at least a few guests. But how is the show these days? I heard the don't even play the Len Maltin game anymore which is sad.&&Excellent movie, and I love all the gorgeous landscape shots in it.&&[Link to the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuHDS5281uw). definitely worth the watch:

&&Stay away from the vents Tom Skerritt. &&What interview is this from? link please?&&It is one of my favorites. I second this. If you love Harry, you owe it to yourself to see it. Wim Wenders directed an absolutely great on road-ish movie. The cinematography is just wonderful and the acting is second to none. A bit depressing, but superbly acted. &&I love this move so much. The scene with him and his ex-wife in the strip club is a masterclass in acting, directing, everything. A gorgeous film, and Harry Dean Stanton was a treasure.&&I remember a scene where HDS is walking along a bridge (I think) and at the middle of the bridge is a crazy man just screaming into the wind. Stanton's character as he passes the madman just places his hand on his shoulder as if to say, ""I know"". Some how it's one of the scenes that I remember.&&Right when I read this headline I thought of this movie.  I knew every one would mention Repo Man, which is a 10/10 in it's own right, but this movie, Paris, Texas, was something else.

It is nothing special, no crazy myserious plot or action or super funny comedy.  It is just a story.  A really good fucking story, and this guy plays the main role so good it's impossible to forget him or this movie.

(You kind of have to be in your 30's or something to really appreciate this movie, preferably after a few serious relationships and maybe some kids thrown in)&&She dated Leonard Cohen too so she had great taste in old blokes.&&Link for those interested. The movie is set to be released in two weeks... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KLLkj84GAo&&The thought I come back to in those moments is ""everybody dies."" It calms me for some reason.&&I finally started taking Lexapro about a month ago. For about a year, I would have a panic attack right as I was falling asleep every night, or if I tried to take a nap during the day (which became incredibly common, because I had just started grad school, and I wasn't getting sleep at night because of the panic attacks). I'd wake myself up, and freak the fuck out, just thinking about death. 

I'm 26. Nowhere even close to death. Yet, it sits on my mind every day. I'm consumed by it.

I'm sleeping again, but now my brain is really starting to get weird when I try to take naps. If I wake back up while it's still light out, it's not a big deal, but if I wake up after the sun has gone down, I'm disoriented as all hell. I have a dog that I always walk after I wake up just to get my mind back to normal, and without fail, whenever I see one of my neighbors in the last two weeks, if I previously took a nap, I say, ""Have a good morning!"" I'm also finding myself wishing my neighbors a good night after taking my dog out in the morning. If it wasn't becoming such a common occurrence, it wouldn't freak me out. However, it's starting to.&&Been having quite the existential crisis lately. Can't stop thinking about it and the thought absolutely terrifies me. Worse than any fear I've ever felt before. And I have no idea how to cope with the feeling. &&I thought about it from a very early age... like I'd be lying in bed at 6 years old asking myself ""what would it be like to not be anywhere?... forever. How can you not be anywhere?"" It would send shivers down my spine every time. I feel like I've made peace with the idea, and it even sounds peaceful on my more depressive days. Still, there are odd moments where it hits me again and I don't ever want to die. No more shivers though.&&[Here are some more bits.](http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a5459/harry-dean-stanton-quotes-0109/)

&&[A beautiful end to his career](https://youtu.be/ame5L8HJ6i0)&&In a number of points, possibly coincidental but certainly numerous, Twin Peaks the Return has distinct resemblance to the works of Stephen King. Stanton's character seemed to be a sideways reference to the protagonist of Insomnia, an aging man who discovers he can see the manifestation of life force leaving the body.

It is worth noting that in Insomnia, that protagonist shortly enters a dream realm where he encounters dwarflike otherworldly beings.&&Carl Rodd was the superhero of the summer...a force of pure good, complete with Carlmobile&&Yep. He was amazing returning as Carl Rod. Always looked forward to seeing his scenes in the trailer park. Will be sorely missed&&I've been smoking for 75 years every fucking day&&[deleted]&&I just told my wife that Harry Dean Stanton was.  She had no clue who he was. I told her he was in Repo Man.  She said what was that.  I said it was a cult classic that for some odd reason Reddit hasn't blown up yet. &&""Goddamn dipshit Rodriguez gypsy dildo...punks! I'll get your ass!""&&I do, in fact, go ""Oh shit it's Harry Dean Stanton!"" every time I see him, much like I do with Keith David.

I'm pretty bummed about this, but at least he lived a good long time.&&I just watched Christine two nights ago. Funny how things happen &&shitters&&How is this not closer to the top? &&One of my favorite characters on that series. &&Came here looking for this. Roman Grant was one of the creepiest characters on tv but HDS played him beautifully. &&I always tear up for [that final scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFmOOlLcsFY). Hardly any words are spoken...always makes me think of my brothers.&&Harry Dean and Richard Farnworth scenes in that movie are flat out some of the best acting ever filmed.  What a gem and a real story.

Didn't realize he was in Wild at Heart. Guess I gotta see that next!&&Damn everyone talks about Twin Peaks. I gotta get on that.&&His reprisal of Carl Rod was so beautiful in The Return. Not a huge role, but his scenes were really touching/hilarious/intense. He could do it all. I'm really looking forward to exploring more of his work. &&He was awesome in that show. I'm almost to the last season.&&Big Love is one of those strange shows that is sooo good and had some decent buzz when it was new, but has become relatively forgotten and unknown in the short time since it ended. I feel that way about Rescue Me too. They both had episodes/seasons where they dropped off, but had several seasons where they were among the best television on at the time.&&WHISKEY!

Though I never met Harry, coworkers had. 
By all accounts from them, he was a down to earth guy.

An ordinary fucking person.

An ordinary fucking person, stuck in anything but an ordinary position.

Yes, he was in a variety of movies, but HDS owned his role in Repo Man.

&&Pretty sure Showtime already said they're up for it if David Lynch actually wants to do it but I have a feeling we've seen the end.

Many of the actors already passed as noted. The cast was already half older adults in its original run. Some came back just to make special appearances and not even all did that - Michael Ontkean for example is retired and declined to return.&&Without Albert, Carl, and Margaret, what is point?&&Chills and tears every time,   but now I have two boys.... So I see it from Harry's point of view &&Ian Holm: 86

Could very well go in order...&&Last night, I had this dream about Harry Dean Stanton.  I was telling one of my best friends about it this morning.  I was trying to get him to sign an autograph, but he'd only do it if I could list all the films in his filmography, and I couldn't.  I was like, ""I don't remember them all.""  And he was like, ""Then what am I supposed to sign?  I don't remember...""  I just messaged my friend and told him Harry Dean Stanton passed away, and he said, ""you missed your chance.""  I was like, ""I did, I really did.""  It's been a roller coaster of a fucking day.&&Ok I'm very sad about his passing but your comment is funny as fuck. &&What are you? Some kind of Parrot?&&My brother-in-law who is currently smoking his way through stage 4 lung cancer would disagree.&&I'd argue it's just all the ones you've witnessed they just quit too late. My grandpa never stopped smoking and died from lung cancer within a month of diagnosis. And all the other problems he had from smoking (emphysema, COPD, etc) are why he basically had no shot with or without chemo.&&Paris Texas is the first blu-ray movie I ever watched, and holy hell - what a feast for the eyes.   

&&good for her, but for me I prefer young ladies with poor taste in old blokes&&Saw it at the Provincetown Film Festival. A slow roller but a great watch. It's definitely targeted towards seniors but I'm in my early twenties and once I got used to the pacing I was laughing and crying with the rest of the audience. &&yeah definitely gonna see that. Will be a beautiful farewell to his presence on screen&&I wish that worked for me. I'll reason my way out of the anxiety one day with one acknowledgement like that but the next time it'll be meaningless and I have to find a new ""comforting"" thought. Stupid brain.&&For some reasons that doesn't work for me. I hate to sound selfish but when I think 'well everybody does"" I think ""I don't give a fuck, I AM GOING TO DIE"" It makes me feel like shit honestly. &&I just worry sometimes about *how* I'm going to go. It can happen at any time.

It is the kind of movie I can watch any time, if I'm sick, studying, working on something, or wanting to relax. It also has a pretty decent cast. &&Because it's amazing!&&The part with the gum is awesome &&It's a great hangover movie. You're on the couch hungover and want to watch something funny and stupid that you've seen before (so you don't have to totally pay attention) and don't mind watching commercials because it's on TBS at 11am. You know the general plot of the movie but the gags are still hilarious. And Kelsey Grammar is a national treasure.&&Down Periscope and McHale's Navy are my favorite childhood movies - putting aside Top Gun and Dances with Wolves - and The Dark Crystal gave me nightmares as a child. &&Ask a Sailor what movie most accurately portrays Navy life.  They'll probably say Down Periscope.  If they don't, it's because they haven't seen it yet.&&One of the most underrated comedies of the 90's. It got absolutely shit all over but it is easily one of my most fondly remembered movies from my childhood. It's actually on HBOGO and I watched it this summer. Still holds up, imo.

I have find memories of watching this as a kid with my mom. Probably one of the first movies and first actors that really stands out in my memory.... Along with Bowie in Labyrinth, of course. &&I'm with you. It's the definition of a hidden gem. 

It doesn't even really have Christmas ""cult"" status, wasn't popular when when it was released or now, but there's enough of us to keep it available for viewing. &&It's the last movie my dad and I saw together. I was 4.

Still one of my favourite Christmas movies.&&Twin Peaks, the movie and the show both, are enough to make anybody want to immediately get up and get a damn fine cup of coffee. &&I'll always remember him for this line&&He has a small part in The Straight Story too.&&Wild at Heart is one of my all time favorite movies. And the only movie where I don't wish Nick Cage would just walk off screen and never come back. :)&&I think we're on season 4. Bill is trying to be a politician. I'm from salt lake so this show has a little added fun for me. &&The cooks... They always survive. &&i mean i've never been in the military but do you really think the cooks on a battleship are just chilling frying eggs while there's an insane fucking battle going on&&Cooks in the navy are expected to be damage control experts (fire fighters), and be trained in/stand watch with small arms/mounted weapons just like all other sailors on a ship. In fact a cook (hate to say i forgot his name) received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Pearl Harbor.

Furthermore cooks work consistently long hours, more so than many other rates in the Navy, they provide invaluable support by keeping the ship ready for its mission. I agree that we toss the word hero around far too much when talking about service members, but two things: sailors in the pacific were 100% directly put in harms way and they knew this, and two I've met many men who wouldn't make it as cooks in the navy. &&That's like being a cook in Bastogne during the battle of the Bulge. Nearly 5K dead from kamakaze attacks and 368 ships damaged and 36 ships destroyed.  &&As far as I understand at battlestations you are no longer a cook you go to a secondary job.&&And Bob!&&David Bowie if you count sentient tea kettles. &&Fuck!

I remember him best from Alien and (guilty pleasure) Down Periscope.&&I mean, they made it work just fine without Pete or Catherine Martell, Leo Johnson, Donna Hayward, or Annie Blackburne; and many of the fan favorite characters who did return (Audrey, Doc Hayward, Carl, Ben Horne, Jackoby) didn't really do anything to advance the plot.

I'm holding on for Lana Del Rey.&&Will President Roosevelt get an Oscar? &&I genuinely didn't think I could relate to someone so hard. Thank you for this. &&You aren't alone. We all feel this way, and it's because our stupid brain can't grasp the concept of not existing. Our existence is a concept we can't understand because we can't explain our own consciousness. It's a thing that is beyond our abilities to understand, like the beginning and end of time, or that the universe is infinite and there isn't some invisible wall out there. If there was a wall, something must be on the other side. The neurons in our brain can't and won't work those problems out because it defies the way our neurons work to solve problems. We are a physical based life form, and we only understand what is physically here in front of us. Death is the end of consciousness, and it transcends the physical. This is why you fear it--you can't understand it. This is a concept we all live with in fear. It's really all about acceptance. Once we accept it as it is, rather than try to explain it, it becomes less scary. &&Yeah man it's just like, ""Oh, so billions of people, stretching back to ancient Roman and the Egyptians and Mesopotamia and prehistory, have all lived and died despite many of them, I'm sure, fearing death and seeking to avoid it as much as me.

&&Same bro. My mom of all people got me turned onto this movie when I was a kid & it always makes me tear up in a couple spots. I don't know if its because my moms not here anymore or what, but its def fucking super sad in some places without being over dramatic or anything like that.

The part where she comes home like its just another day but completely in shock at what just happened then starts sobbing uncontrollably sticks out.&&Great in Inland Empire too.

I'm terrified of death. The logical part of my brain tells me to shut up because I'll be too dead to care.

Then there's the other part of my brain. The imaginative part that makes me try to imagine what existing in that state is like. Like I'll be aware that I'm floating in nothingness and I'll be driven insane for all eternity because there's nothing and no one to be around.

The part of my brain that puts the mental image of my own corpse in my head and really freaks me out.

Those two parts of my brain argue. Sometimes the logical part wins and I chill out and sometimes it's the imaginative part of my brain that wins and I have an anxiety attack.

It's times like that when I miss being religious. Death seemed like such a bittersweet thing. Now it seems just horrible.

Maybe once I feel I've accomplished my main life goal, I'll feel satisfied and feel like I could be comfortable with dying. Until then, I'll try to use my fear of death to motivate me to do what I feel I need to do to live a full life.&&Thank *you*. I'm very new to the whole death anxiety thing. I mean, I've had it once or twice every few years for as long as I can remember, but in the past month or so it's kicked into overdrive and it's *constantly* on my mind.

Sometimes I try to imagine what it's like after you die, but either way, how can you imagine something which you can't even fully understand while you are alive. As I've stated in another comment, I'm not really religious, but I like to think that there is something greater, or that there is something beyond. I believe in the separation of body and soul, but I understand that there are people which don't believe and that is ok. We are all in the same boat, and the best thing we can do is help eachother so we can live our life to our fully and not to worry about things in such a violent way&&What scares me is not seeing myself floating in nothingness, but seeing the eternity that I won't exist; the fact that I will end, and that the time to reach my end is infinitesimal compared to the time that comes after. And in those moments of pure anxiety, I *see* that dark eternity and its inevitability, and I just can't cope.

By now I have reached the conclusion that my death anxiety stems from my holding on to my ego too tightly. I need to learn to let go of seeing myself as an identity separate from the rest of the world and get peace from the fact that other things will live on, even if I will not.&&Dude I'm on the same boat here. I think I started having this anxiety attacks when I was 12 years old and I began to see how the real world is. And then it stopped till I was 18 and I began my first real relationship with my current girlfriend. I think it was the fear of losing her, and my own fear of death and what lies beyond. I don't even know how to consider myself, I'm not really a very religious person, basically because I'm not into any specific religion, but I like to think that there is something beyond, and sometimes that thought calms me and other times it worries me. What helps me a lot is talk with other people about this, might be my girlfriend or another stranger in the internet like we are doing right now.

All in all, what I really want is get some good sleep at night and not be awake fucking up my own brain with these anxiety attacks.&&Harland Williams is fantastic in that movie.

"'Indiana Jones 5' Won't Feature Shia LaBeouf's Character, Writer Says",32767,6y08mi,http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/04/indiana-jones-5-shia-labeouf-not-returning/,3353,1504530799.0,,"*After appearing in Crystal Skull, LaBeouf, whose representatives did not return EW’s request for comment, criticized the production in a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times. He told the paper he felt as if he “dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished,” and that Ford wasn’t happy with the film either. Ford later responded by calling his costar a “f—g idiot” for his comments.*&&It all honesty Shia LeBouef wasn't the worst part of that movie. He didn't help, but there were bigger problems imo&&The problem wasn't Shia Labeouf, it was the script.&&They'll probably just have Mutt be in school or something. Since this is definitely going to be Ford's last one, they better make it good&&I feel like people aren't reading the article... It reads as if he were fired for criticising Crystal Skull. He said they dropped the ball on the legacy of the character (which *many* in this sub would agree with), and Ford fired back saying he was an idiot.

&&#BRING BACK SHORTROUND!&&Why tf are they making another Indiana Jones movie?&&You can keep his character. Indiana Jones (after the first film) has a family-like tone with the people Jones partners up with. The problem was that the greaser was miscast by someone who can play relatable light-hearted characters like Sam Witwicky, Stanley Yelnats, and Louis Stevens.

Hell, [even Shia LaBeouf thought that he hurt the film and unfortunately paid the punishment by Spielberg and Ford for criticizing.](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shia-labeouf-abandoning-big-budget-movies-361943) Spielberg told Shia, ""There's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars."" and Ford said that Shia was ""a fucking idiot"" for his comments.

It's terrible, really. Besides him being [a cannibal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI) and [a capture the flag ""gamemaster""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw9zyxm860Q), I think he's a pretty good actor in both thrillers and light-hearted films. Shame Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was one of the stepping stones to him swearing off big-budget films.

And I'll say this: He was one of the few good parts of the first Transformers trilogy as the character was more connectable than Mark Whalberg.&&Indiana Jones V: Indy and Jar Jar Binks Go To White Castle&&-hey,where's your son?
-He had to go.His people needed him&&I thought he was ok. Not great by any means but ok.&&Blaming LaBeouf for the problems with that movie became something of an Internet sport. I just rewatched all the Indy movies and his performance stands out as arguably the best in Indy 4. That movie had far bigger issues... least of all him. Hell, I'd even argue least of all the alien angle. It feels like George Lucas shot some of those scenes in the middle of shooting the worst green-screen heavy scenes in Attack of the Clones.&&no aliens, overuse of CGI and humans swinging from vines either please

and no ""JOONNNEESSSYY!!!!!!"" either

no nuking fridges too&&Well, now we wont be able to blame the shitty movie on Shia anymore. It's gonna fall solely on Spielberg. &&Im more surprised they're making another Indiana Jones movie.&&a fifth movie? seriously? what is harrison ford going to play, one of the cryptkeepers?&&How about we think of something new?&&Not even as an actual cannibal?&&Guy's batshit fckn bananas&&his method acting is not everyones cup of tea&&That God damned fridge scene... I should've walked out the cinema right then and there &&Great. Now drop the rest of the characters and the script down a dark hole and let this franchise rest in fucking peace you creatively bankrupt golddiggers.&&This thread really has an odd tone from what I expected. The general appeal is against the person calling out a shitty film for being shitty and for the folks who are polishing the turd and hoping for another go with 70 year old Indy to cash in?

Shia was one of many problems, but far from the most egregious. And he could have been successful if the script wasn't dogshit and nostalgic fan service work-ins.

I'll watch it streaming eventually, but this makes sense only if the film is just Indiana actually teaching now as a old professor who is past pensioner age.&&Shia's too busy anyways playing capture the flag with Nazi frogs&&Guess he was...PART TIME&&I don't like it when characters are simply written off.

If you didn't want Shia in your franchise, you shouldn't have put him in it to begin with.  It would take actual writing skill and vision to turn that character into something good, and if you aren't capable of that, maybe we don't need a fifth fucking Indiana Jones movie from you.&&How bout we just not make another Indiana Jones, k?&&Wouldn't have anything to do with Spielberg blackballing him, would it?&&People act like Shia ruined the movie. I don't recall him writing the movie being about aliens, or chose to write the scene where he swings from vines like a monkey.&&Actually, I rather liked both Shia and his character in the film.


It was a decent movie overall, for me it only jumped the shark when the aliens became first a hive mind and than extra dimensional and *then* destroyed all the artifacts they supposedly had come for.


It was like someone crammed in all the tropes they could think of and then didn't give a fuck anymore.&&The big question is why is there a need of a fucking Indiana Jones 5&&Just Chris Pratt, most likely.&&Really don't get the Shia hate. Someone wanna explain? He wasn't even bad he perfectly acted the movies overall feel. 
&&Just get a 20 something Asian guy and say it's short round all grown up &&All this talk about Lucas Spielberg ford and Shia. Everybody forget that Karen Allen was fucking atrocious reprising Marion? &&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.&&I really didn't mind Shia in the movie. I just didn't like the things they made his character do. The vine swinging thing comes to mind. Plus I am not a really big fan of old Indy. Maybe if the plot had less to do with aliens and more to do with cold war antics and more religious artifact like how all the other movies were.&&I think i speak for a lot of people when i say; please dont make another Indiana Jones movie.  && Came in expecting Standard Shia Shit talking, but was pleasantly surprised by the number of people calling out the real problems: writing and direction. I love Spielberg but this had so much outside input it was never going to be good (cough cough Lucas cough).

I will add that given the darker range he's shown of late (a la nymphomaniac 1) he could be really good if they were willing to write a smaller more human story. &&Oh yeah, this movie is still happening.&&Spielberg will not divide us&&[deleted]&&Still disappointing though, I love Shia LaBeouf &&Shia might be a compete maniac in real life, but he's always been an excellent actor. I'm actually pretty disappointed. It would be nice for him to go back to his snarky, funny characters again.&&Unpopular opinion: Shia wasn't bad in crystal skull.&&I keep getting more and more hyped for ""Indiana Jones and the Golden Corral"".&&Better idea: 

Don't make Indiana Jones 5&&They need to make a movie about his famous Capture the Flag game!  HWNDU!&&Shia was good and his character was good, Berg was the problem&&Both LaBeouf and Ford actually seem to come off well from this. 

LaBeouf:

>You get to monkey-swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven. But the actor’s job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn’t do it. So that’s my fault.

Ford:

> I think I told him he was a fucking idiot. As an actor, I think it’s my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive, and talented – and he’s learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult.&&Shia's other comments:

>“You get there, and you realize you’re not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You’re meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He’s less a director than he is a f—ing company.”

>“Spielberg’s sets are very different. Everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you’re doing for a living.”

I think he lacks tact but I can see where he's coming from. It's not easy to meet your hero and discover your values clash.&&[deleted]&&> Ford later responded by calling his costar a “f—g idiot” for his comments.

Translation: ""What the hell, Shia?  Don't you want that sweet industry cash?  That's basically all I do nowadays.""&&From what I understand Harrison Ford, as much as I love his movies, also has his own head up his ass and can be very difficult to work with, Spielberg has made some amazing movies but his best movies were *decades* ago, and the quote from Spielberg about it really just being about making the money sums it all up. It's Hollywood, it's always been about money. The Hayes code was the standard for a long time, and movie-making was really just like any other hierarchical business. There are great movies from the pre-60s and 70s, but because of rules and money the *types* of movies you saw were pretty bland. These days independent filmmaking is where it's at, it's far more accessible and there are people with truly great ideas who aren't in it just for a $100 million paycheck. 

Shia definitely has some issues but he really is an impressive actor. Clearly, when he's dedicated to a role he puts everything he's got into it. I would have never expected the kid from *Even Stevens* would develop into such a great actor. I wish he would straighten himself out a bit because his behavior isn't going to help him get good roles, that's for sure. 

Both Shia and Ford have said and done some *really* dumb fucking shit and they *both* need to learn when to keep their mouths shut. At least Shia didn't nearly crash into an airliner in his private plane...

edit: [Here is the original article](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/05/shia-labeouf-wall-street-2-indiana-jones-steven-spielberg.html) where Shia makes the comments in question. Quite frankly, after reading that  I have to say fuck Steven Spielberg and fuck Harrison Ford. Shia accepts some of his own responsibility and he gives some serious praise to Spielberg, he also says Harrison wasn't happy with the film either and I'm fairly certain that's the case as I recall comments from him about it as well. Ultimately, Spielberg just doesn't want *any* negative publicity for a potentially hugely profitable film from one of its' lead actors. If you don't want that, then get them to sign a contract/NDA and shut the fuck up. Hollywood is just a mess and this one fantastic example of why.  &&Han Solo calling me a f-ing idiot is nightmare material.&&Aliens alone imo.  plus it wasn't like shia wrote that ape swinging scene, lots of people approved it  &&personally I think the general idea of Indiana Jones ""passing the torch"" wasn't just good, but necessary. I don't care about senior citizen Indiana Jones.
&&[deleted]&&He wasn't that bad in it as an actor. Most of the hate for him comes from the part he was written for the film and from people not liking him off-screen.&&Like the CGI 👎🏽&&[deleted]&&It wasn't just him.&&I want to see the fedora passed on to Short Round&&As long as Georgie isn't involved they'll do alright&&Shia tells the truth and gets criticized from both sides of the isle. It’s sad really. &&That's what I thought, but even if he did flat out say ""you know what, looking back the movie wasn't good and even I wasn't good in it"" then what's the problem with that? Spielberg and Ford just sound like they don't want any criticism at all even if it is true. Everybody has said that the film just outright sucks and didn't come close to what we expect, so Shia saying something much less harsh about the movie shouldn't be some ""Omg wtf"" moment. Disagree with him if you want but don't outright criticise the person himself.&&Steven Yeun is the obvious choice &&My favourite quote is ""I think I'm stepping on fortune cookies"".. good ol shortround.&&It's part of the reason Harrison agreed to Star Wars IIRC.&&Ford wouldnt do star wars unless disney agreed to another one.     
Its fords personal movie
&&I mean, I get your point, but he's an iconic character, Ford is still around and willing, and I can understand they want to make sure the last one is, well, better than Crystal Skull. 

Plus, my assumption is that, because the character is so iconic, they could feasibly set up a young actor to play the role and have the franchise live on within the confines of a movie where we see, say, *insert young actor* in a flashback. No way Indiana Jones is going to fade away. At some point they are going to reboot or come up with some way to get more sequels, whether you like it or not. So Ford and Spielberg have an opportunity to set it up the way they want to, and again, try to finish Ford as Indiana Jones in a better way.&&I think it's like Rocky 6 redeeming Rocky after the terrible Rocky 5.

''Kingdom of the crystal skull'' left such a bad taste in everyone's mouths, that I think it's worth doing a good sequel to make everyone forget the other one existed.&&$$$$$$&&Indiana was made as Spielberg's answer to James Bond, so why not serialize him the same way?&&He's actually pretty good in Fury as well.&&Shia Labeouf should be the villain in Bad Boys 3.&&> Spielberg told Shia, ""There's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars."" and Ford said that Shia was ""a fucking idiot"" for his comments.

Fuck you, Spielberg.  Fuck you, too, Ford.

I'd prefer to be honestly told if a movie is shit, so that I don't have to fucking watch it.  You keep being you, Shia.&&He's a really good actor. Maybe not the best but really good. He gets a lot of shit for his personality and off screen things; that's pretty much where all the hate comes from. I don't care about what he does around town, I've loved him since he acted in Holes.&&Time to sell cars? Fuck this guy. You can make great movies and make a lot of money doing it. Fuck him for making BS and selling it to his audience. Shia is right. He's a business now not an artist.&&Man, how'd I miss the whole He Will Not Divide Us fun?&&No ticket&&Same. Frankly better then most give him credit for. I think the hate on the movie is due to people wanting it to be a serious action movie like raiders or crusade. It was intended to be a movie in the vein of B movies from the 50s and I think people missed that.&&The whole diner scene with Shia and the chase through the town is really awesome imo, both for the little moments of character depth and the cause-and-effect style action.  It's a shame the rest of the movie couldn't preserve that tone.&& I came here to say this too.  I thought he and Ford had good chemistry. &&It’s mind blowing, even in just this thread. I’m convinced nobody on this sub actually watches movies...just shitposts about them and repeating other shitposts without critically analyzing anything.&&People talk about LeBouf of the fridge scene but the lazy green screen is what really let me down. The car chase scene in Raiders is and always will be great because it's real people doing real things so it looks real. The chase scenes in Crystal skull were real people doing fake shit in front of fake shit, so it looks fake. &&I liked the whole nuke fridge bit though :(&&Don't forget CGI gophers for some stupid fucking reason. This movie baffled me. &&SHIA LABEOUF &&I agree with RLM's take that the kid doesn't deserve a lot of the hate for this film. All n' all he wasn't as bad as I thought he'd be.



Regarding the bananas... I find he's become more ""watchable"" in recent years. He was fucking great in Fury.&&Lurking in the shadoooooooooows&&4chan broke him. &&Shia publicly insulted Steven Spielberg. The director/producer that can make any film on or below budget while also turning a profit on it. Where as Shia is heading into behavior that can make him unisurable.&&I'd be okay with a young Indiana Jones. There are enough stories out there to adapt, that don't require them to pay lip service to the established films.

They could also easily be dissasociated from the rest of the films.&&People keep wanting Indy to keep doing the same shit hes been doing since Ark but the problem is at this point Harrison is too old to make any of his antics believable.  &&...because Harrison Ford isn't dead yet?&&You were right about one thing... the negotiations were short.&&I don't know how he does it, but that was at once a back handed complement and an actual complement *and* it makes me like Ford even more.&&As ussual, the entire quotes make everything look different.&&I TRIED to like it but that monkey scene annihilated my tolerance.

Scripted and animated at Syfy quality.&&That's not all Shia said.  He didn't come off well of it.  It has certainly affected his career.  As is evident by them not even considering him for the next installment.  &&Even when Shia takes all of the blame on himself he still manages to get people to hate him. Kind of shitty. &&I think that was what Ford was getting at, too. Shia's not wrong, you just don't say that shit about a movie you worked on and a director you work with. Especially if it's Spielberg.

Though honestly I give Shia credit, because amidst his public derision for the movie and production, he did take some responsibility which you don't always see. &&Yeah, he's not exactly wrong... Look at how many films Spielberg has produced or directed within the past 15 years. You have your hands in so many different projects that something will eventually suffer: rushed production schedule, shoddy script, poor CG. I could see why Spielberg would have an assembly line type set. Gotta get it all moving to make deadlines.

We got The Adventures of TinTin 3 years later though so I can't really complain about Crystal Skull being a bust. It's the best Indy/Uncharted movie of the past decade and an animated one no less.&&Personally I don't think tact is needed he gets a lot of shit for the movie but I think he did ok honestly. His char was meh but it would have been meh no matter what actor they choose after all the movie itself concept wise was meh. How that script got approved is beyond me the whole thing was sub standard.&&That's kind of similar to what RedLetterMedia said in a Plinkett review, something about how Spielberg (and Lucas) are getting old and are already rich and aren't trying to make masterpieces as much as just fun films that they know their family would enjoy&&For all the shit that people give Shia LeBeef, he's not as much of a dummy as he looks. I'm not going to say I have mad respect for the guy, but my opinion of him has changed substantially in recent years.&&Never meet your heroes.&&Shia is everything we hope for as an audience - brutally honest with the public, self effacing, dedicated to his craft, and pretty damn good at it. (I'm sure he's done a shit job in some film, but I haven't seen it.) For some reason, people shit on him for it. &&A lot of times people measure you by your greatest works and not by your collection of works.

Jordan missed way more shots than he made.&&A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, ‘You are mad; you are not like us.'&&Honestly no one did a good job in that movie and the thing in general stunk. Shia wasn't very good, but I also don't think it was him so much as he wasn't right for the part and maybe the director just wasn't trying hard to get a better performance out of him. Directors have a lot to do with an actors performance. Like Tarantino has the ability to take people that are other wise mediocre actors in their other movies but he really makes them shine in his because he pushes his actors to be better and be their part.&&Hes done a few good movies. I liked disturbia. But everyone just hated crystal skull so much that they needed something to blame. Like you said. Kick a guy while hes down. Its the easy scapegoat. Harrison Ford was in that same movie... but its han solo. Cant hate on that.&&Ben Affleck had a pretty memorable quote about how stupid Armageddon was. Something along the lines of it being harder to train oil drillers to be astronauts than it is to teach astronauts how to use a big drill.

He was told to shut the fuck up as well.&&*thats it shia youre not gonna be my son for star wars 7*&&It actually was just taken out of context. Ford paid Shia compliments for his passion and talent but advised him to be more diplomatic and suggested that his job wasn't over when the cameras turned off, he was still obligated to do everything he could to make the movie a success, including not talking it down.&&> LaBeouf said that he could have kept quiet, especially given the movie's blockbuster status, but didn't think the film had fooled anyone. ""I think the audience is pretty intelligent. I think they know when you've made ... . And I think if you don't acknowledge it, then why do they trust you the next time you're promoting a movie.""

Shia LaBeouf actually seems to be too honest for Hollywood here.
&&Well, saying:

>We [Harrison Ford and LaBeouf] had major discussions. He wasn't happy with it either.

isn't going to make your co-worker happy in any business. I might criticise my workplace sitting around with you but that's a far cry from wanting you to go to the media and **tell them** that I was critical of the production. Not cool bro, not cool at all.&&>just being about making the money

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMmZq0rTpA0&&Call him han solo irl and see what he calls you... &&Didn't give a shit about aliens, Indy movies are always about the super natural. 

But that swinging scene was just a complete fucking joke. You can suspend disbelief for a lot of things,  but that really takes you out of being immersed when it's completely unbelievable. &&* Aliens
* CGI everything;  CGI ants, CGI gophers, CGI Indy doing things Harrison can't anymore.
* Forcing Harrison to play the action role when he's clearly not at that level of physical fitness anymore, they should have owned up the age and set him up similar to the way they did Connery
* Weird ass vehicles made up solely to sell toys
* Blanchette being unable to maintain the same accent for more than 15 seconds straight
* Mutt as a character
* Nuclear tests being performed near area 51 for some reason
* Surviving said nuclear tests with a fridge,  It's not even the radiation that gets me, it's that it's literally flying hundreds of meters through the air in intense and bouncing the fuck around and he's fine

There are so many questionable choices made in the production of that movie.
&&I think people forget this kind of craziness was part of the originals.

Using magic to pull out a beating heart or ghosts and Jesus lasers melting a Nazis face is okay. But aliens is too much?!

You can survive an airplane crash by gliding down a mountain safely with an inflatable raft. But a surviving a bomb by hiding in a fridge is ridiculous!?&&I expect mystic fantasy when I watch an Indy movie. Instead we got a pseudo science fiction story that didn't really fit with the whole Indiana Jones theme.  
Lots of stupid scenes too, Tarzan Shia, mutant Ants, anti nuclear blast refrigerator, etc.&&Before I saw it, I didn't mind Shia at all. He has the charm and humour, can LeBeaf up well, kind of resembles Ford and could give something new to the character. Then the movie drove itself into the ground... &&Or they could just stop making Indiana Jones movies. I know that's asking a lot from Hollywood, but for a story to have any sort of weight it needs to definitively end. There's much less tension and suspense when you know the ending is going to leave characters in a position to return in another film. &&Personally, they just shouldn't have made it. If it's not Harrison Ford as Indy, then I don't care to see it. At the same time, I don't care to see geriatric Indy either. &&""Part time""&&Send me an email on this webzone if you want some pizza rolls&&Yeah.  Plinkett's [Autopsy of Crystal Skull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zphhfHon_I&index=10&list=PL2CCF5FDA9CEEBDB8) is far more entertaining than the movie was. 


One of his best points, imo,  is that in the Original Trilogy, Indy kills 10-20 people in each movie.  In Crystal Skull he kills one guy, maybe.  Crystal Skull is made for babies.  Its almost as bad as making a Predator movie, where Predator doesn't kill anyone. &&That's my second favorite franchise to masturbate to&&Always does. His Ghostbusters review was spot on in why the new version straight up sucked--and it was NOT because of sexism. &&Part-time&&Aisle. An isle is an island. &&Unfortunately, that's how many companies run&&Fuck it. Why not the orignal actor? &&At least now i'm prepared for every remake/revisit/sequel he makes now, ~~due to his anti-cgi policy.~~ EDIT: might be wrong here. can't find proof.&&Source?&&well it better be bloody good&&As far as I understand neither Spielberg or Ford have any interest in the passing the torch concept.&&After assuming Rocky Balboa was going to be a complete joke of a movie when it was announced and then finding myself enjoying it nearly as much as the original, anything is possible with Indiana Jones 5.&&Geese, I just looked up this movie. He was like 60 years old during that movie. Crazy. I should watch it, I've seen Rocky 1-3 and love them, and I also liked Creed.&&Indiana Jones 5: The Search for More Money &&Then they should find a differnt Indiana Jones.&&and I liked him in Disturbia and Eagle Eye, but I'm mainly focused on his light-hearted roles related to his character in Indiana Jones rather than his dark thriller/action-oriented roles.

**Edit**: Typo.&&He's REALLY good in Fury...&&Fury is easily Shias best acting work of all time, he managed to stay on par with Brad Pitt and Jon Bernthal which is very fucking impressive. But then again I only saw him in Transformers and Holes so I don't have much to work with. &&He's good in American Honey&&Or 28 Jump Street&&[deleted]&&It has always been a fact that you cannot really say anything bad about the creation you helped to make because it also seems like an insult to everyone else you personally worked with and how it appears to belittle all of them. It's an unwritten rule that became common sense but no one really wants to admit it.

Even when the film is polarizing or terrible, it's all about trying to sell in order to generate a profit. When you're put on a soapbox due to your position, your word alone can possibly make some money.

and it's not just Hollywood. It's pretty much like this in any sort of work environment.

I think Spielberg was trying to help LaBeouf while always-grumpy Harrison Ford knows what happens to people who badmouth the film they were a part of.&&Seriously, now these guys are getting a little too big for their fucking britches.  Not everyone, but a lot of people called the movie shit for a reason.  LeBouf was just being real.  Fuck Spielberg and Ford, they're not the artists people fell in love with.&&HE was ok. The movie itself was atrocious no matter how you look at it.&&Yep. That scene is really well done. Shia is 100% making an effort. Even Ford is good. The movie is okay until we get to that monkey-swinging stuff. From that point on, it's as if the filmmakers lost something.&&This was my issue with The Hobbit movies. I loved the first movie and there were some really great things in the second movie. 

I just hate how it looked so fake. &&To be honest, I thought that bit felt pretty Indiana Jones-esq. I mean he found the ducking holy grail at one point. I feel like had the overall movie been better, that particular scene would either be enjoyed or never mentioned, but the overall panning of the film caused that one scene to get thrust into the mocking starlight. &&HE'S BRANDISHING A KNIFE&&Shia surprise!&&Spielberg was also the one who had Megan Fox fired. After she compared Michael Bay to Hitler.&&There already was a TV series based on young Indiana Jones meeting famous people in his adventures.&&They did that already&&You are a bold one.&&It was basically Ford admitting the movie was shit, without saying it was shit, which is showing Shia *how* to be more diplomatic while telling Shia he needs to be more diplomatic.&&He does it by being genuine.&&Hi friend, I think you meant to say 'compliment', an expression of admiration. A complement is something that enhances or completes something else. Have a great day!&&Something was bugging me about your comment and I realized a bit later that you spelled ""usual"" with two s's. Haha made me question my sanity for a sec because it really didn't seem wrong &&OUCH. True, but Ouch!&&Hey, Battlestar Galactica was SyFy, let's not get hasty. &&For me, it was the ants scene immediately followed by the monkey scene.&&Yeah, but, outside of greed, why would he want to be part of the next train wreck?&&I think it's more that he doesn't want to be in it, more than they don't want him in it. His career is fine.&&It is a breath of fresh air to hear someone just come out and say that sort of thing, though. I can really respect Shia for that. Has some strange potentially self-destructive integrity.&&In my experience the people who you ""don't say that to"" are the people who need someone to say it to them the most.&&Sounds like James Patterson books. 

I was getting tires done at a Sam's Club, and while walking around to kill time, I noticed they had a lot of James Patterson books for sale. I have never read one but I have see them a million times over, so I tried to read a synopsis to get an idea of what he is about. Then I noticed that every book had James Patterson in huge letters and then ""with _______"" at the bottom of the cover. 


It would seem that James Patterson writes outlines for stories and then gets another author to write the actual book. He gets a book, they get writing credit on a National Bestseller. Win-Win. 


James Patterson published 40 books in 2016 and is on track to publish 50+ in 2017. He also has announced 11 to be released in 2018. He's a book factory more than an author. &&I love spielberg's work from the 80s and 90s but recently (because of his age i guess) it's felt like he's making movies for my dad, dad movies. he makes dad movies now. 

Has spielberg made anything ""classic"" in the last 15 years? I can't seem to think of any. also i've noticed a lot of his newer films don't feel like spielberg. His films used to have a look and tone that were instantly recognizable as his, now i'm not so sure. &&I was blown away by the TinTin movie, god, it was just gorgeously done.  Shame we'll never see the storey finished in sequels.&&Where's the fuckin sequel?&&Spielberg simply has gotten older and lost his edge, he lost that magic that makes his movies his movies. When he was younger everything he made had his unique style to it, now anything he does felt like any run of the mill director could do it. It's what happens all artists, at some point they lose what makes them special and you up like Eric Clapton sitting on a stool playing tears in heaven, or Tim Burton who hasn't had an original movie since beetlejuice and now remakes movies and makes them dark and wacky. Spielberg has done decent work, but he hasn't made a great ""Spielberg"" movie in 20 years or more.&&Yup. Lots of things wrong with that film. He as an actor was not one of them. &&Same happens with Edgy Comedians, look at Eddie Murphy's earlier career , and what happened after he started getting 20 million dollar  paychecks, and after he's made nothing memorable only the kids movies he did.  And dad comedies now.  He just doesn't care anymore.&&Young dude with passion and ""fuck you"" money. Of course the circumstances are way different but he really reminds me of Marlon Brando.&&[deleted]&&His role in Fury won me over big time&&The Company You Keep has been my favorite Shia movie for a while now. You should check it out. But Rear Windo... I mean Disturbia is great because of the legs it has to stand on.&&> Harrison Ford was in that same movie... but its han solo. Cant hate on that.

""Part time""
&&Nymphomaniac, Fury, American Honey, Maniac - he's been in some decent films.&&[deleted]&&Now I'm just imagining a world where Shia is Kylo Ren&&I understand that Shia is a little polarizing, but I just don't get the hate. The guy is a very talented actor. &&""I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies."" - Jon Snow. &&Hey, I actually like Titanic! I also agree with many of the criticisms of it, the simple fact is when hundreds of millions of dollars on the line you just don't take risks, and Hollywood knows what sells. 

I have a much better example of what that video is trying to portray: Pearl fucking Harbor. What an absolute disgrace to everyone who lost their lives and the damage done to our country. I'm not one of those incessant Micheal Bay haters, but Pearl Harbor was such an important an enormous event that Bay (or whoever the screenwriter was, don't even care) watered it down to a love triangle that was even more extensive than Titanic's. It was disrespectful, it was badly produced, it had an A-list cast (a star-driven film, which makes more money, people are more likely to go see a movie with actors they already know). At least with Titanic I'd say 2/3rds of the movie really focuses on the actual disaster and Cameron did a good job (for the time) of creating an authentic feel.

The end of Titanic still pisses me off, with the way it as shot it was quite clear that Jack could have gotten out of the water and not drowned, but then it wouldn't have been nearly as dramatic and extremely clichéd.

edit: If you want to see the *original* movie about the Titanic disaster (there may actually be one that was made in the 20s or 30s IIRC), do yourself a favor and watch *A Night to Remember*, it was shot in the early 50s I believe and is a very accurate portrayal (with no love triangle!), and don't be put off by the fact that's in black and white. It was far better than I expected it to be when I first saw it.  &&He'd probably be pointing while saying it, too.&&also every single thing around that scene. 

A car full of people shooting AK-47s at another car? No problem. 

Driving off a 200 foot cliff? no problem. 

Massive army of ants literally dragging people away? No problem. 

It's like someone decided ""suspension of disbelief"" means just do whatever you want, and no matter how many  things multiply off each other it will never become insulting to the viewer .

Exact same thing happened in the hobbit.

In the book they find a goblin cave, walk through it, and escape. 

In the movie they are thrown by mountain giants randomly land in the goblin cave and then surf a wooden scaffolding down a 1000 foot drop and are all miraculously unharmed. 

Holy crap there is just no tension and no point even finishing the movie after this. &&Indy movies aren't just about the supernatural. They're about ""religious"" supernatural. The Ark, the rocks, and the ~~Grain~~ edit: Grail were all religious artifacts. Nothing wrong with Indy going after alien artifacts IMO, but the movie created no sense of wonder or mystery for the audience. We at least cared about the Ark and the other pieces because we already knew their backstory, or were told that in the movie. The aliens had no backstory the audience knew, so we're supposed to care about this object he's going for and understand when they face the consequences of getting it? It made no sense.

edit: Re-thinking my comment, I think I'm wrong. They do explain the crystal skull and the consequences of it in the movie. I just think it was a dumb artifact and didn't feel important in the movie because I didn't care at all about the characters pursuing it. None of the action pieces brought me into the movie either. I think that was the problem and I was over-analyzing it.&&I'd say aliens are more sci-fi than supernatural. I'll take a lame monkey swinging scene over the shit alien premise that wasn't even presented well. &&Pretty much any part with CG. Like WTF was with those damned groundhogs/prairie dogs? I mean, they don't even need to be in the film.

The swinging scene was at least plot related (though, that might make it worse). 

Honestly, most of the movie in a-ok with. The fridge was literally a jumping the shark moment, but absolutely in the spirit of Indy films. Same with those weird aborigines that jumped in and out of the dark. And the murderous ants. Even the aliens were OK.

The skull being magnetic when convenient was dumb, though.&&I mean, there was also the car top formal fencing battle, Indy using a snake to get out of cartoon quicksand, and surviving a Nike in a fridge at the very start of the movie. I liked Mutt, I think a son is a sensible route for things to go if they're going to have to make an Indiana Jones 4. The whole movie was just fucking stupid, bad acting on the leads part is the least of the problems. &&> Indy movies are always about the super natural

Yeah but this was not super natural. It was science fiction. That's why it didn't fit.&&>Nuclear tests being performed near area 51 for some reason

Well the nevada test site *is* very close to area 51. &&Man it actually could have been kinda cool if it had been about Indy being grumpy and stuck in the role of limping professor who can't fight for shit due to age and past injuries, but who has gained a lot of wisdom after getting beat to shit in all his adventures. 

Basically recreating the roles from the last crusade. 

Then have them go on an actual classic indiana jones esque adventure with ***no fucking aliens***.&&Just a side note, the CGI effects only annoy because they're bad. If they were better either through more physical references to aid the sfx team, or simply a larger CGI budget both in terms of $$ and time they wouldnt stand out as they do now. &&Nuclear tests were conducted not too far from area 51. You can find the craters on Google earth/maps not too far from Area 51. &&They actually did tons of nuclear tests [near Area 51 - almost 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site). There's a tour where you can go see some of the craters and the mangled houses that you see in all those famous black and white movies of nuclear tests.

The movie sucked in many ways, but the Area 51/nuclear test proximity was not one of them.&&>* Surviving said nuclear tests with a fridge,  It's not even the radiation that gets me, it's that it's literally flying hundreds of meters through the air in intense and bouncing the fuck around and he's fine

How did you feel about him jumping out of an airplane on an inflatable raft and surviving without a scratch?&&I liked the religious stuff because it was mysterious and scary and weird.

It made religion into this strange and disturbing ghostly power beyond our understanding.  

We saw glimpses of the power, but it was never laid out in front of us.

The aliens, we literally saw them.  Like implied aliens would be one thing.  But CG aliens and a CG space ship thing?  It's like if they had God come strolling out in Raiders Of The Lost Ark.

If it was just hinting at aliens while some weird stuff went down, that'd be fine.

But it was too in your face about aliens doing alien stuff.&&They're both ridiculous scenarios but there's a sense of fantastical logic to the raft thing.

* Rafts have lots of surface area and catch wind easily
* They're not that high above the mountains and there's a snowy slope to absorb the impact.
* It's not shown doing any wild maneuvers, it opens, catches the wind, they glide down and land.
* It's absolutely unrealistic and could never work IRL, but it works without breaking the suspension of belief too badly.

Meanwhile; with the fridge we have a situation where:

* The entire audience is well aware of just how destructive nuclear weapons are
* The working logic behind the scene is ""there's lead in this fridge so I'll be safe from radiation""
* What's not taken into account in that scene is that the fridge is jettisoned into the air and blown away several hundred meters in several hundred degree heat.
* It's not speculative or left to the imagination, the fridge is shown flying through the air, striking the ground hard, bouncing and rolling and hitting again and again before Indy casually steps out to be greeted by a CGI groundhog.

They are nowhere close to similar qualities of camp.&&Whenever I hear friends talking about part-time work, the weird-ass way Harrison Ford delivers that line pops into my head.&&Only good line&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1269  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/76137)&&Nah aisles are what artists use to hold up their paintings&&They'd have to rename him to Tallround then.&&Yep, can't wait for Witness 2.&&Anti-cgi policy?&&It's reddit brah&&They have said ""Ford is Indiana"" many times. And I think they need to say that over and over again to not allow rumors otherwise. But remember, they had Phoenix play young Indie, and there was the young Indie chronicles. I really think they will acknowledge it's bound to happen and try to own ""how"" it happens. Like Lucas selling Star Wars in his own way, making sure someone he likes (Kennedy) took over the studio, I think Spielberg and Ford will try to assign a future actor and director they like for future films. The way to do that (because they don't own the character, Disney does) is to set something up in a new film. Have someone like JJ Abrams (obviously not him, but a similar young director) film a flashback with the new Indie. Fans will likely appreciate that Spielberg and Ford get one last crack at it but okay the future iteration. &&Which is weird given Crystal Skull's ending.&&Everybody was telling Stallone ""Rocky 6"" was just a fucking sad joke, and he kind of wrote it into the story, with people telling Rocky he was just a sad, old joke, now. It turned out pretty decent.  &&Indie: ""I belong in a museum!"" &&This is 100% true.

I support him more than I ever will Harrison Ford or Spielberg. They seems like shit compared to Shia. &&I'd watch an anti-hero superhero movie starring Shia.&&Kinda makes Ford a hypocrite because he made fun of cowboys vs aliens on Conan.

Paraphrasing from memory:

Conan: So you're up against the new Smurfs movie which is funny because the last time you were here your movie was also competing against Smurfs.

Ford: Last time... What movie was that?

Conan: Cowboys vs Aliens

Ford: (facepalming) Oh jesus christ...&&At a certain point morality enters and I think Shia was on the right side&&Same. Indiana Jones always gets into these bizzare situations that he somehow survives. He fucking crash landed a plane that he had never flown before and survived for fucks sake.

Calling a movie a ""classic"" is very subjective. The movies listed below were all critical and box office successes, with multiple award nominations and wins counted among them.

* Catch Me if you Can
* Lincoln
* Bridge of Spies
* War Horse
* Minority Report


Edit: Based on other comments around this thread, I'll need to sit and watch *The Adventures of Tintin*.

Edit #2: Also *Munich* apparently.&&I thought *Munich*, *The Adventures of Tintin*, *Lincoln*, and *Bridge of Spies* were all excellent. ""Classic""? I can't say (they usually have *one niggling thing* that keeps me from loving them unconditionally), but I won't be surprised if they're reconsidered in the next couple decades as some of his best work.

One thing that I think has affected him is switching cinematographers. He started his career shooting with pros like Allan Daviau and Doug Slocombe and Dean Cundey, but he's switched almost exclusively to Janusz Kaminski since *Schindler's List*, and I think Kaminski's images have a slight grain and extra textural effects that sometimes come off a little too self-conscious.

That second bit might explain why his films don't currently ""feel like"" Spielberg from the '70s and '80s.&&Minority Report.&&We were supposed to though, what happened to them?&&Same here. Too bad it tanked so hard.&&Why? Has he stated he doesn't want to make any more of them? I really liked Tintin too &&Batman

Edward Scissorhands

Mars Attacks&&while there is still some typical ""Spielbergian"" things in his movies, I feel he also tried to stay ""relevant""....

... which of course always has the potential to be a winning and a losing scenario. as in: if someone doesn't change with the times that person can be viewed as being ""reliable"", ""constant"" and someone that ""always delivers"". but it can also easily be seen as being ""stuck in the past"", ""not being able to evolve"" etc.

(I think that dilemma is even more prevalent in music)
&&Disagree. I don't think he's made anything that matches his films from the 70s to early 00s but he's still released some great films:

Munich

War Horse

Lincoln

War of the Worlds


Bridge of Spies

Tintin

Shia's completely right about Indy 4 though, and it's refreshing to hear an actor be actually honest about their work. 


&&Yeah, I didn't like him in it, I didn't like his character, but I don't think it's really his fault, he did fine as far as acting imo, he was just given shit to do, as with the prequels the failure was in the writing.  

The guy calling Indy ""Jonsey"" pissed me off the entire time, he was so cliche I wanted to strangle a baby.  The monkey tree swinging was a little out there, but I like to remind people that indiana also jumped out of a plane with a retarded blonde women and a little chinaman in an inflatable raft then landed on a mountain and rode it down into a river and subsequently it was the waterfall that got them.  TOD might be the least liked in the originals, but indy did a few other things that were kind of outlandish (in a good way?).  

People also complain about the aliens, or 'interdimentional beings'.  I say it's a valid topic for indy to tackle, especially with the cold war/russian timeframe.

Fury and Lawless have been the only mainstream films since Transformers 3 and he was great in those and the dozen other indie films he has done. American Honey most recently was fascinating and I am looking forward to McEnroe/Borg&&He's an easy target:

* Criticizing Indiana Jones? No-No
* Criticizing Harrison Ford? No-No
* Criticizing Spielberg? No-No
* Criticizing the kid who's been part of internet infamy, was in transformers movies, and on cable tv, however...&&I've liked almost all of his movies, and his acting. Holes, Battle of Shaker Heights, Fury, Transformers, Lawless, Disturbia, Greatest Game Ever Played, Disturbia, Eagle Eye, plus others I don't remember. He is one of the more consistently enjoyable actors, with quite a range, to watch in my opinion. &&He's a talented actor but a shitty person, especially when he's drunk... which is always. 
&&You hit the nail on the head for why I did not enjoy either of these movies. I think pace is another factor. With both of these movies it was just one big crazy thing after another. 
&&To be fair, the giants were in the book version of The Hobbit, but the amusement park ride of the dwarves clinging to their legs was a Hollywood invention.&&You forgot the fridge scene.&&To be fair, the Indy movies have always had a questionable relationship with reality and suspension of disbelief.

Afterall, Indy DID hold his breath for the entire sub ride in Raiders of the Lost Ark...&&Yeah, the outlandish action really destroyed any sense of tension in these scenes. The older IJ films were developed in the spirit of the old action serials from decades prior, but they all had a more or less believable sense of gravity and impact to them. The one exception I can think of is jumping out of a plane on an inflatable raft in ToD.&&> In the movie they are thrown by mountain giants randomly land in the goblin cave and then surf a wooden scaffolding down a 1000 foot drop and are all miraculously unharmed.

> Holy crap there is just no tension and no point even finishing the movie after this.

Holy shit, that was the exact scene i quit watching that movie at and lost all interest.

&&Being at the center of a nuclear blast. Oh here's a fridge, no problem. &&I thought it worked in theory because of the setting. Obviously it wouldn't make sense to have Ford in another WWII setting, so putting in the Atomic Age, where the public imagination was captured by flying saucers and aliens, was a good idea with a lot of potential flavor. They just screwed the pooch with the buildup; if they were instead pursuing an unknown supernatural artefact and discover hints that aliens made it (without actually seeing the aliens) it would have been a lot better.&&The Holy Grain was the best one. &&Also, you would see the relics do something spooky like kill the Nazis or whatever, but seeing the aliens themselves would have been like Jesus showing up at the end of Raiders.&&[deleted]&&Yeah kind of like Logan treatment to the Indy movie&&Completely agree.  It was that really floaty CGI where nothing looks as if it belongs and everything is slightly blurry looking.  Like they smeared the screen in vaseline. &&Honestly the raft was more realistic -- it at least landed on a slippery slope that would've effectively transferred the energy from the fall in a ""safer"" way. That and it would've had a slower terminal velocity due to drag coefficient. The fridge was insane -- it was thrown by a shock-wave that would have likely had sufficient accelerative G-force to knock Indy out if not kill him from the launch, let alone the brutal landing on hard-pan desert dirt. That dude would've had two very good reasons to be dead and instead just stood up and walked away. They can play it off like he's a lucky bastard and been cheeky about it like they did, but that's just absurd -- the dude was 70. He was completely unfazed by something that would've killed Indy from Raiders 30 years prior.&&Also I think the whole ark bit works well because it's based on something from classical antiquity. It really  doesn't delve deep into anything or really explain much of anyrhing. Whereas perhaps imo aliens are kind of a trope where you can explain anything with nothing   &&Yeah, the raft thing is adventurous but feels believable, the fridge thing just seems weird. It's one of those Superman having super strength vs nobody knowing who Superman is when he's on tv all the time.&&[Mythbusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODvOx0V57E) says it's possible.&&Easel?&&Oh just cause he's Asian he gotta be tall, eh?&&Regarding Henry 2!! Guaranteed box office hit&&Yeah I googled and have no idea what they're talking about. My best guess is that Harrison is against recreating his younger self in CGI, so he gets to physically act in all remakes/sequels/etc.&&Yeah I've come to realize half of informational Reddit comments are people just pulling shit out of their ass &&Yeah, but Lucas proceeded to call Disney ""white slavers"" and such. He had a bit of remorse about his decision. &&He's used to people thinking he's a ""sad joke"", then proving them wrong. Look up the story of how he got the first Rocky made if you don't know it. That story itself could probably be made into a pretty good movie.&&Ford is 15 years older than Connery was in the last crusade. And I dunno if you've seen him in interviews or anything, but he definitely has not aged as well as Connery did.&&[And his father, North Dakota Jones.](http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/cliffhangers.html)&&Or the best remake of Rear Window. &&Had me freaked out and suspicious of all my neighbors for a solid couple weeks.

David Morse did an amazing job, he was terrifying. &&Oops.&&""Then there's a time to sell cars...""

Fuck. If he didn't sign anything saying he couldn't criticize the movie, despite being in it, then fuck Spielburg for revering such antiquated tradition. That type of sentiment keeps the world plastic.

If you help me carve a horse out of a block of wood and I fuck it up, how big is my ego for publicly ridiculing your criticism of my shitty-planned carving project?  &&Shia as Red Hood please&&Like, you know, using an inflatable raft to escape a crashing plane? We somehow are okay with that, but the fridge scene is a bit too far. &&> insert young actor in a flashback. No way Indiana Jones is going to fade away. At some point they are going to reboot or come up with some way to get more sequels, whether you like it or not. So Ford and Spielberg have an opportunity to set it up the way they want to, and again, try to finish Ford as Indiana Jones in a better way.

At least when Kubrick makes actors redo a shot 80 times, you know the end result will be optimal.&&Blaming it all on poor George&&Hi friend, you're absolutely right! I try to keep my corrections short, so I sometimes have to sacrifice some meanings or explanation.

I've grown up in a world where the author of a prose book is publically believed to be all of these, imagination-wise, plus the invisible hand of the editor.  Yet there are ghost writers, novelizers of movie screenplays, and people who create an outline (usually before their untimely demise) someone else finishes.

If I'm good at scenes and moments, but not dialogue and transitions, why shouldn't I have a co-writer who does what I can't yet?&&With those books, I like to think of it as Patterson created the universe, and each co-authored novel is another voice telling a story *within* that universe.

Clive Cussler is similar in that regard.&&I've met several of Patterson's coauthors, and they all have had really great things to say about the process. Apparently he has the outline, they do the main writing, and then together they do the editing. But he's supposedly super nice and involved in everyone's lives and is known to remember people's kids birthdays and stuff...and of course they get an incredible paycheck out of it.&&He sits at home and his only job is to walk out to his mailbox to collect checks. Dream job if you ask me.&&Nobody can really compete with 80s and 90s Spielberg. Not even Spielberg.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Munich doesn't get enough love.&&16 years ago he made A.I.&&Munich is one of Spielberg's best movies and his strongest work since SCHINDLER'S LIST. The most mature film he's ever made.

It may have wiped away all the goodwill that the American Spielberg earned with Israel for Schindler's, but fuck it, I commend him for having the balls to make such a picture. Really, the first time in my lifetime I remember clearly when Spielbergo was a political target this side of an Oliver Stone. People were calling him anti-Israel and anti-Palestinian at the same time.

War of the Worlds is also my favorite alien invasion movie and criminally underrated. One of the best post 9/11 films ""about"" 9/11 and especially interesting as a meta-film regarding terror and escapism. I'd easily take it over his critically acclaimed historical drama's like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies.
&&I enjoyed Warhorse. &&Bridge of Spies was pretty good I thought.&&I liked minority report&&I watched Bridge of Spies about two months ago and actually enjoyed it. Then again, it's hard to miss with Tom Hanks as the star. I mean, I know you CAN, but it's pretty damn hard.&&Catch Me If You Can is probably my favourite film of all time. Damn that film is great.&&You forgot Munich. Nominated for best picture and director and one of Spielberg's best.
&&War Horse was SO TERRIBLE. The scene where the riderless horses are jumping... wtf? WW1 PG13 is never a great idea.&&June 2002, so *technically* more than fifteen years ago.&&Underperformed in the US box office, which is what matters first and foremost to Hollywood.&&?

&&[deleted]&&> War Horse

What? Really? Dude that was such a nothing forgettable film. I mean it's not *bad*, but it's probably one of the blandest films I can think of.&&>People also complain about the aliens, or 'interdimentional beings'.  I say it's a valid topic for indy to tackle, especially with the cold war/russian timeframe.  The other ones were about a magical jesus cup, and the fucking arc of the covenant.   

Thank you. Your final remark nails it on the head.&&I actually liked the Do-over.&&Adam Sandler lives on two planes of existence, the physical and the metaphysical. He has ascended to such a metaphysical sate of being, that He knows that all in the physical plane is temporary and will never matter to Him. Adam Sandler no longer makes comedy; He has become the comedy. To Him, the physical plane is His playground: He simply walks into a studio, shouts, and leaves with our precious resources. He then laughs at us humans for spending our time and money on His content.&&Yeah this is the problem. I'm from Austin and he has a reputation of showing up at in our town, getting really fucking drunk, and then getting in fights with people (usually over girls) or trashing a hotel room. 

I'd say he's talented but has some issues. He needs to work on those issues because they're getting him in constant legal trouble. &&Sometimes I think that they write some of these scenes with the thought that it might ultimately become a theme park ride...&&I still enjoyed the Hobbit. Very different from the book and very different from the lotr trilogy. Very fantastical and ridiculous. But it was fun. I cannot say the same for Indy 4&&""he saw that the stone giants were out, and were hurling rocks at each other for a game"" 

That is the extent of them being in the book my friend. I don't think it's ""fair"" at all to try to claim this mitigates a single bit of what I said, where it's ridiculous to make the characters ON them and literally all to a man get tossed into a cave through sheer luck where any one of them who did not enter the cave would be killed....

It's quite one thing to ""suspend disbelief"" that the party saw some rock giants. 

It's another thing to say ""Ah, once again they have all rolled the dice of life and death and randomly every single one of them just so happened to have lived"" 

One of them is a tension (and movie) killer. The other is a tiny bit of world building. 

&&Exactly! It was the reveal that ruined it. It's not like Shiva came down and bitch-slapped Mola Ram at the end of ToD.&&The original James Spader Stargate movie already did ""Indiana Jones with aliens"". It actually felt like an archeological expedition, while Crystal Skull felt like a monster movie.&&Honestly, I would have been okay with a slightly more modern-era adventure.  Jones drank from the Grail, and even though the templar said he'd have to stay to continue to benefit from its effects, I always interpreted that as ""you live longer, but have to drink from it every so often"".

It's plausible that Jones could, say, have an adventure in the 60s, 70s or even 80s, and just be crazy-old, but still capable.

The idea of Mudd was not bad - Ford's not getting any younger, and having a bright-eyed novice Jones can pass the torch to would be a good way of opening the franchise up to continued exploration.  But LaBeouf was just not well-directed, and his part was weirdly assembled out of bits and pieces that just did not work.&&Indiana Jones and the Wheat Gluten Alternative&&The Wholey Grain? Must be wheat.&&You can make that into Holy Beer, I understand.&&The Last Crust-ade&&I just pictured Ewan McGregor popping up as Jesus saying ""Hello there""...&&It was, but it was more like a 'Wizard of Oz' reveal than anything. It takes the 'magic' out to see actual aliens with actual spacecraft. The artifacts in Indiana Jones have a sort of mystery and wonder that was destroyed by seeing the little green men behind the curtain.

Temple of Doom also didn't feature a Judeo-Christian God and we were okay with that. &&The Shankara Stones weren't Judeo-Christian either, but they were used to much greater effect in ToD than the Crystal Skull was.  Also, aliens brings in a second ""magic bean"" into the Indy universe, and that usually kills a movie.  It doesn't matter that the aliens were seen as gods, they were aliens which is different from God/gods/religious powers which are proven to exist in the Indy universe.&&While that sounds cool now (compared to the shitfest that 4 was) had they done that at the time a lot of people would have just complained about them rehashing the last crusade and how this didn't live up to that, blah blah blah.

I would like to see the movie you're describing but if we didn't have our crystal skull as a frame of reference for how bad Indy can be, I'm pretty sure people would still have shit all over it for something or other.

On the other hand, monkey swinging. Hm.&&Nah easels are like these small animals that look like chipmunks, but have a longer neck. Kind of like a badger. &&Presumed Innocent 2: Presumed Guilty&& Regarding Henry is a great movie&&Henry gets shot in the head again while buying Ritz Crackers at a convenience store, and his recovery leads him to become a dick again. So his now grown son schemes to return him back to ""normal"" so he hires now much older John Leguizamo, who just got out of prison for the original shooting, to shoot Henry a third time. But instead of turning him back it just kills him. &&Just go to ELI5. I don't see a single source for the majority of posts, and then you have contradicting fucking posts right at the top. It's like people upvote shit whatever they like. Lol&&and fanboys exaggerated that even worse than Lucas

he worked his whole life on Star Wars, of course he's gonna feel a little remorse about it

still possible for Indy

&&Why not do what they did with mad max? Just re-cast him for an earlier adventure&&Megans main complaint with Michael Bay is the rarely spoken about fact that he sleeps with all the women he hires. He treats them like shit, and fires them and hires a new girl who will sleep with him every movie. In Hollywood circles it has been commonly known that he calls getting blown ""washing his Ferrari"", and in an interview Megan did on the tonight show years later complaining about Bay she said to be hired for Transformers she had to go to his house and he filmed her washing his Ferrari.&&You make a solid point. I was just making a lighthearted observation.&&I've heard from people who've been on set that Michael Bay is a major asshole.&&If we can get Shia working, he'll be a funnier character than we've ever had before.&&That rubbed me the wrong way since Spielberg also had some shitty ideas. I still think the movie would've been better with George's original idea of Indy having a daughter instead of a son.

It ties into the TV show and it's not a repeat of the father/son dynamic of the previous movie and instead it adds a twist to it. Indy was never good with women because of what happened between his dad and mom, and the heartbreaks of his youth.

But now fate has dealt him a female offspring? The movie already becomes 10x more interesting. 

But no, Spielberg wanted another father/son movie.&&It works for Star Wars. Unless someone is wanting to prove how much better they Clone Wars is than everything else in which case they also use George as an example.

It's kind of odd and disrespectful how the fandom treats him.&&Say Clive Cussler  five times in rapid succession lol 

I don't even think Clive Cussler could do it &&Kind of like how people slap Tom Clancy's name on things even though he never wrote a book about a SWAT team in Vegas or a fighter squadron called HAWX?&&Get me his non-union Mexican equivalent!&&Only if we're talking hollywood blockbusters&&Clint Eastwood would like a word with you. I prefer many of his movies over Spielberg.

Director of American Sniper, Sully, Gran Torino, Flags, Letters, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, Changeling, and Invictus since '00 is pretty damn impressive.

Then you have absolute Western classics such as The Outlaw Josey Wales and Pale Rider (my favorite two Eastwood Westerns). You also have Unforgiven.&&I think Catch Me If You Can is a masterpiece to be honest. It's not a very splashy title, so it gets forgotten, but it's just so damn confidently made, super charming, and I frankly think it's one of the few times where DiCaprio has really disappeared into a role. 

Normally I miss the sort of rough edges of young Spielberg that gave those movies their charm, but I feel like Catch Me If You Can is a director firing on all cylinders. &&I didn't think it was fluffy.  It's one of my favorites, actually.&&It's technically just over 15 years now so it doesn't count I guess, would be close 16 years since it was being worked on. &&Still one of my favorite sci fi films. Great, great movie.&&And A.I. . With each passing year it becomes more and more relevant. I'd say that the way Minority Report was relevant for the 2000s- the first part of the 2010s (in terms of technological progress  and the way it talked about the surveillance State trying to fight thought-crimes) A.I. will start to become more and more important as the progresses in artificial intelligence technology will continue. &&Magnificant film. A ""flawed"" masterpiece, if that makes sense. Another gem from Spielberg.&&I agree, but Bridge Of Spies was pretty great... I don't think many people saw it, and it truly felt like a ""Spielberg"" film to me.  Hanks and Rylance were both excellent in it.&&War of the Worlds lost something with the remake&&Agree completely that WoTW is criminally underrated. It's actually very dark and scary but that ending is a big letdown one way or the other. Not the alien resolution, I was fine with that, but the turning up at the grandparents place. It was just so ""oh, that's it""?&&I remember going into watch WOTW thinking it'd be a great summer blockbuster and leaving it completely out of breath because it had reminded me so much of 9/11. The sheer massive destruction was breathtaking in its realism.&&I love *War Horse*! 

When I was watching *Wonder Woman* I kept thinking of how much better the trenches looked in *War Horse* and how special that film is. 

Severely underrated. &&One of the best Sci-Fi flicks of all time, imo. I hold it up there with *Repo Men*, *A.I.*, and *Live. Die. Repeat.* as some of the most well-executed Sci-Fi concepts on film.&&Exactly! Tom Hanks is so much fun to watch in basically anything&&Indeed. I didn't mention *Terminal* in my short list because it wasn't as widely acclaimed as the ones I did. It also had Tom Hanks in it, and he put in some seriously heavy lifting to keep that film afloat. Completely forgettable without him.&&Agree. Absolutely fantastic performances by Hanks and Dicaprio. Just such an engaging film the entire way through.&&[Agree!](http://www.tzr.io/yarn-clip/f772b250-9509-4749-917f-6b6b2add401f)&&Fuck you time!&&None of it directed by Spielberg, though.&&Aliens were hardly the only problem with that film though.&&I think the difference is how the supernatural is depicted in the films, too. Indy's world exists where magic and mystery lay hidden just below the surface. In Temple, Raiders, and Crusade the movies were extremely grounded in reality. It's generally not until the very end that you get the big reveal -- the X, it was real all along! Up until that point everything is pretty much an incredibly elaborate setup in practicality.

Indiana Jones was the original Mythbuster. He just didn't know it.

The gradual setup leading up to the big reveal gives the films a chance to breathe, slowly pulling the viewer into the world. Because the films used traditional effects (and very well) it was easier for the brain to suspend disbelief and get into the fantasy of it.

Enter Crystal Skull.

There's CG everywhere, a lot of it hitting the uncanny valley. This is why the infamous fridge scene is so particularly bad. It's not really out of line for anything else that happened in other Indy movies (e.g. the raft scene). Not really. And yet it's so exceedingly unrealistic to look at because the effects, the animation, is just scraping the bottom of the valley. It looks good. Too good. And the scene ends up far worse because your brain registers it as being ridiculously fake. It stands out even more.&&You just said what I said in more words so, I agree?&&Though I think we would all pay to see that. &&I don't care what his actual name was in the movie... his name is Kalima&&Which was a credit to how they handled the religious aspects. There isn't even an implied proof of religion. There are just these strange things that have magical powers and people have built up explanations around them. The Ark just *is*. The Abrahamic god doesn't come down and talk to Indy personally, the Crusader believes in the grail, but has no proof other than ""it totally does what the legend says"". The ambiguity is a deft, safe way to handle it that won't piss off most people.

I will recommend it to my friends forever, but I don't think I'd ever call it a classic.  I don't think that term is even a measure of quality except insofar as the quality required to get people to see it, remember it, and transmit the meme onto future generations.&&If you want to see a director firing on all cylinders watch Munich.&&[deleted]&&It's a gem...one that I felt should have ended with David trapped underwater looking up at the blue fairy.

He went to VII's production team with a story treatment but was outright rejected in favor of what he considered a ""retro movie"". His opinion of Rogue One was much warmer than for VII. I think his reaction (if a bit unprofessional) was mostly justified. &&Its not. Its extortion at best, rape at worst. Its also incredibly common.

There is a huge variance in the power dynamic between these young, naïve, fresh to Hollywood girls with no money and no connections who are desperate to become stars, and the older, wealthier male producers and directors.  Its called ""the casting couch"". Its a trope for a reason. They simply imply or a lot of the times outright say ""sleep with me or I wont hire you"".  If the girl says no, the director just chooses somebody else, and may blackball her from the industry. If the girl complains, its her word against his, and he has money for better lawyers, and he also makes casting decisions so no other people will want to speak out against their boss and she get blackballed by the industry for sure.

Also I said girls, but men actually get taken advantage by gay directors as well. Bryan Singer is gay and has hundreds of rumours and IIRC lawsuits about taking advantage of the males he casts in his movies.&&It's not. But it's Hollywood, so.... you know&&Fuck you Rick Berman!

Which ironically makes them very much like their creators. We advance more and more every day, and yet we still look for meaning to our existence through various means.

He did a phenomenal job playing a priest, being a Pope should be no different, but that shouldn't be a surprise.&&I feel like he's aleady done this role.

Except like, the asshole version.&&LOL when he was high sparrow i thought to myself damn he looks like the pope, he should be the pope in a movie.&&If he plays Bernie Sanders and Fred Phelps next, he will have distilled the High Sparrow into his component parts.&&Well of course they would pick the High Sparrow as the pope.&&Two Welsh actors each playing a Pope.

Well then...&&Anthony strikes me as more of a John Paul II&&A bit of a step down from playing the pope in real life.&&I hope he's alright with the typecasting. &&How much you want to bet this is going to be one sided, anti-Catholic bigoted tract?

Too bad, because he's actually a really spectacular guy who really respected Catholic tradition. 

When the pope allows the secular mainstream to dictate Catholic policy, he's not acting as a pope. No wonder they hated Ratzinger so much and love Francis so much. Francis seems to be making decisions based on what the secular mainstream prefers, while Benedict made decisions exclusively based on Catholic dogma, belief, and tradition. The only reason they like Francis is because he *isn't* Catholic, based on many of his actions.

EDIT: I'd wonder why this is getting downvotes. I am simply suggesting that perhaps Catholics should be led by a person who respects Catholic tradition and values. If you don't like those traditions or values, don't practice Catholicism. Consider your reaction to ""hicks"" and ""racists"" in the United States who don't want Islam openly practiced in the country because of its traditions and beliefs, and then compare that to your reaction to this post. Take a good, hard look at yourself and where you get your opinions from before you react to things.&&I read this and thought ""Perfect"".

But for it to actually be any good it's going to need a writer and director who can pierce through the larger-than-life public image of both popes and bring us the actual human beings.

If they can, there's definitely an interesting story to tell around the events they're depicting. I mean, Benedict's butler would hide documents under his clothes to smuggle them out of the Vatican and to reporters.

But there's also a whole lot of conspiracy theory level BS they could go with instead.

The High Sparrow hated the opulence and debauchery of the High Septon before him, and wore a rag and spent most of his time in a dirty chapel rather than in the glorious main Sept. Pope Francis similarly spoke out against the opulence of Benedict and has a much simpler look and view on life.&&*quietly changes laptop wallpaper*&&Fun Fact: the Vatican sold off its last warship only in about 1870.&&> yet

Last year we got HBOs The Young Pope. I was worried it would be contrived, stale, edgy.  Then I found out when watching that Sorrentino directed it. 

What I got was one of the funniest, most intimate 10 hours of my media consuming life.  The man is a master at characters, at finding and conveying beauty. In the end the Pope setting, and his youth, where tools to explore a human character, and not vehicles to carry our interest through scandal. 

In the first episode our expectations of what the series would be like were completely subverted. I loved it. 


But writing for real popes will be weird in comparison. Especially considering they're alive and being depicted as they are now. 


&&Not sure why you were downvoted.  Ratzinger used to head the department that replaced the Inquisition.&&> And why should your secular opinion matter with respect to the beliefs and dogmas of Catholics?

He could have been born in a Catholic family and decided to abandon religion. In that case, his opinion is quite important to the church, to be able to reduce the number of people who reject Catholicism the same way.

Right now there's a noted reduction in theology students and this means the number of priests will reduce as well in the following years.

Not that I care, particularly with your attitude.&&You can always tell who's a filthy casual by the way they spell names

""John"" Snow &&Baelor? I hardly knew her.&&Audio book ""readers"" would have no idea how to spell half the words in the books lol&&Excuse me, but I am Board-Game only.  Show some respect casual.&&> That's Baelor to you, Mr. Show Only.

Baelor The *Blessed*, or the *Befuddled* to detractors. He who walked the Boneway barefoot to rescue the dragonknight. He who built the Maidenvault and made young boy High Septon. 

What a nutcase.&&I shit you not I had a friend genuinely think that Khal Drogo was written as Carl Drogo... classic Carl&&Anti-matter is way better.&&Can't tell if this is a joke or serious.&&Wait, Richard Harris was only in his early 70's when he died?

He looked and sounded like he was in his 80's.&&Henry Fonda won 1 Oscar only, and it was a pity Oscar at 76.  He should have won a truckload of Oscars for his earlier work though. &&His role in The Edge set him apart for me. That movie wasnt supposed to be anything too big but it becomes a treasure for me because of a few parts working extremely well and Hopkins is a big part of that. &&This is an odd comment for me, because I've always known Hopkins as a force to be reckoned with, and even without this latter day comeback, he's already sealed his legacy as one of the all-time greats:

Silence of the Lambs
Remains of the Day
The Mask of Zorro
Just to name a few...

Also check out this small film The Dresser (2015), where he not only plays an aging actor, probably battling dementia, he also musters up this incredibly rendition of King Lear (as played by his actor character, play-within-a-play stuff). 

Hopkins pretty much took the 2000s off, but he never lost a step. 

Richard Harris did a couple memorable roles while in poor health near the end of his life, but to say Sir Anthony Hopkins is ""Richard Harris calibre"" because he's doing great work when old is to gravely misrepresent literally one of the greatest actors of all time...&&Yeah, one of the best performances I've ever seen.  Very understated, but with such incredible depth, reflecting a man of great experience and insight. 
 Rylance is a genius.&&I don't really agree. It is a very hard read as it jumps from periods and reads more like some opaque stage play. This is one of the very rare books I just had to give up on.

He also got the job by giving Oliver Stone a mixtape, saying that some of the recordings were of Jim, and some were him. Stone, who had been friends with Morrison, listened to the tape and would exclaim 'Oh this one is definitely Jim,' or 'that's Val for sure'. They were all Kilmer. He had been in a Doors cover band. And in the movie, anytime Morrison/Kilmer is singing and it's a close up shot, that's Val's voice. They use the studio version for the wide shots. &&As a huge Doors fan, I was not initially thrilled with that casting.

However, the rest of the Vatican is portrayed very corrupt at times, and the show occasionally completely misses the main points of Catholic philosophy (the abortion scene comes to mind). &&I think he would. At first I thought it was going to be a blatant hit piece on conservative Christianity, but it's far more nuanced than that. The characters are portrayed as imperfect people, but they're not evil. If this were an American show, I think it would have been purely hyper-critical, but the Italians still have a bit of warmth and respect for the Church, I think. Plus, it's just beautifully made and directed. &&Yes, I'd say so. I'm rather traditionally devout and I enjoyed it, as did most of /r/Catholicism. It's by no means an anti-Catholic show, or critical of Catholicism – a few people were offended because Pius XIII states that he doesn't 'believe in God', but they missed the deeper reasoning for this (he claims to actually know God, and thus doesn't rely on faith).&&When Lenny dropped the baby was one of the most impactful moments a show has had on me. &&/r/curvy&&It's not bad tbh, but apparently some people were expecting American Sniper instead and were upset by the notion that wars are in fact a bit of a crap idea, or that the campaign in Afghanistan might not be 100% successful.&&Don't expect much.

I started them a couple years back after being up to date on the show. One of the main things that annoyed me was how he did voices so different from the show. He made proper Tywin sound like a barbarian Robert Baratheon. Then, worst of all, I swear he would flip to different voices for people all the time. It was the absolute worst. I'd be trying to remember who is who only to have their voices change to another person.&&*I'm a what!?!?*&&The board game where to win, you actually need to kill other players.&&[The official board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones_(board_game\)) is actually really fun.&&Casual.

I am just asking because I don't know a lot about Catholicism &&>(he claims to actually know God, and thus doesn't rely on faith).

Interesting. I can no longer be a Catholic because personal experience of the Divine has made it impossible for me to say large swaths of the Nicene Creed without perjuring my soul. Likewise, I find faith and belief ""with the Church"" to be a poor substitute for mystical prayer which makes an honest dialogue with God impossible. I find the Church as it exists, as well as its various Protestant  offshoots, to be a nihilistic cult of the flesh that robs people of a meaningful relationship with God.

I didn't want to watch this show because I thought it would make me unbelievably angry with how the trailer played up Law's character's embrace of pre-Vatican II opacity. But now I'm intrigued.&&I personally didn't like it much because it was all over the place. Not quite comedy, not quite satire, not quite action, not quite thriller. And the pacing was off.&&For real. So many nightmares about household appliances. &&Air conditioners haven't been the same since. &&Its not him.

If only they'd kept the 10 episode policy going... oh how much greater season 7 could have been if the timeline wasn't as screwy.&&I highly, highly doubt this is true. Yes, Martin did share his general plot outline with D&D, but that doesn't mean they followed it. There are multiple very big plotlines, which are completely absent from the show, that would make taking the books in the same direction as the show virtually impossible without some plainly awful writing.

Book spoilers:

[A surprise Targaryen, a proper Dornish plot, Stannis doing well in the North, and Catelyn coming back from death- just to name a few- are developments that necessitates a vastly different path in the books from the show.](#spoiler)&&Brawn&&GNU Terry Pratchett&&Well, whenever anyone asks GRRM for official pronunciations he always says something like ""It's fiction, pronounce it however you want"" so there's really no official right way of pronouncing things, book-wise.  Obviously the show has enforced consensus on how these made-up names should be pronounced, but Roy Dotrice's readings (at least the first few) predate the show.  It's just Roy alone in a booth reading these gigantic novels, so I can't really blame him for letting a few pronunciation inconsistencies slip in.

That said, he's obviously wrong.&&In my head I always read it as Cate-lyn, not sure why...&&There's also at least one instance where he calls Joffrey ""Jeffrey"" and then switches back. Maybe more but I haven't finished the first audiobook yet.  &&Right proper Targaryen. &&I said, yer a hairy wizard.&&Auntfucker&&Can go on for aaaages, though. So worth it though.&&[deleted]&&Agreed. Very uncomfortable to watch. Way too many characters too.&&It's Vai Kilmer... don't you know Vai Kilmer?&&""Podricks Law"" has enough girth to it.&&Plus it sounds like a show-watcher trying to say the name of Tyrion's squire, which is an added bonus. &&>You can always tell whose a filthy casual by the way they spell names

Are we being invaded from the north?&&It'll be like the film The Book of Eli, but [the Bible](#spoiler)         is instead the last book of ASOIAF&&I really don't understand this decision. I assumed when it was announced that they just didn't have enough material to fit in to 20 episodes and didn't want to put any filler in. Instead it seems like the pacing is absurdly fast to the point where multiple characters are making journeys to and from places on the other end of a continent in a single episode, and conversation is sparse because they have no time before they have to get to the big event of the episode. 

Don't get me wrong, I really liked season 7, I just don't see the point in having it be shorter. Doesn't seem to have increased the quality much to me.&&It's also pretty likely that George has changed his view of the plot pretty heavily in the years since he shared his outline. He goes through a lot of revisions and rewrites and plot changes to make it all work as best as he can make it, and even though some plot lines in the show aren't even possible in the aftermath of book 5, I'm pretty sure that the show has several plot lines that were at one point planned for the book but will be scrapped before publishing&&I always wonder how long it took to record the audio books; they are so massively long! &&Probably because we're used to the modern long-A version.

In Biblical times, the Israelites believed the child didn't get a soul until it took its first breath. Insofar as the modern Catholic Church is descended from Peter's apostolic tradition, Church doctrine hasn't always said life begins at conception. 

The Bible says nothing directly on the subject. Current church doctrine is basically CYA because conception is the beginning of a life. Pick any later a date and you run the risk of being wrong. All the stuff that's been said around that is just fluff to add the appearance of substance. &&Thank you!

During the early days of World War II, the fate of Western Europe hangs on the newly-appointed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Hitler, or fight on against incredible odds.

Give this man the recognition he deserves already!&&Much as I love Gary Oldman they're going to have to work damn hard to beat Brendan Gleason & Into the Storm. His performance and the movie itself was incredible. &&I'm sorry guys, but I'm starting to feel the Winston Churchill fatigue the critics have been talking about.&&There's a lot of stuff out there about Winston Churchill already and he is sort of portrayed in the same light... sort of British Jesus.

I wouldn't mind watching a performance that also demonstrate his vast character flaws... sort of like how the film Patton shows that it was his character that became a problem.

Churchill was chicken little crying that the sky was falling.... right up until it actually did.  It's difficult in a film to convey how silly what Churchill was saying was.  It's be like North Korea conquering China.&&Are they really making 2 Churchill movies in the same year?&&Ben Mendelsohn is in this movie too? Wow, not that Gary Oldman wasn't enough, but now I'm 10 times more excited. &&I read Gary Coleman, now that's a movie id see.&&Oh come on, TV execs.

We *do* have other Prime Ministers. Wait till you hear about William Pitt the Younger. He makes Churchill look like a bibulous old windbag. His father used to stand him on a tree stump in the garden and made him stand there in the rain and wind until he was able to give a proper speech in Latin. Aged *4*! They thought he was going to die of tuberculosis aged 14 so they sent him to study at Cambridge so his dying in the house wouldn't depress his father. But he lived! It was his father who died while giving a dramatic speech in the house of Lords

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Earl_of_Chatham#/media/File:The_Death_of_the_Earl_of_Chatham_by_John_Singleton_Copley.jpg

To 'avenge' his death, Pitt the Younger entered paliament the same year and became Chancellor of the Exchequer at *21*, domininating the Commons when everyone else wanted to cave in to Napoleon, though he was leading a party of *one* - himself! The only person who backed him was George III who, as everyone knew, was insane. By the age of 24, he had scraped together a majority in the Common out of nothing, and became Prime Minister. It was called the 'mince pie administration' because everyone thought he was just a kid who would eat mince pies and then disappear. Some little bitch wrote an anonymous poem in the Times:

""Above the rest, majestically great,
Behold the infant Atlas of the state,
The matchless miracle of modern days,
In whom Britannia to the world displays
A sight to make surrounding nations stare;
A kingdom trusted to a school-boy's care"".

Instead, he remained in office for twenty years by which time he recouped George's losses in the US by building a new empire in India, he backed William Wilberforce and the Anti-Slavery movement, while building up the Royal Navy just in time because the French and Spanish fleets were coming together to sweep the Channel clear for the Napoleonic invasion force at a little place called Trafalgar... And we was doing all this while drinking FOUR bottle of port a day! He died at an incredibly young age and his mother was astounded to find he had debts of £40,000 - hell, that's about $25 million today - and couldn't think what he had spent all that money on, since he was apparently working  twenty hours a day. They didn't tell her he was blowing it all on Cheapside prostitutes, smuggled in at breakfast time every day, two at a time. He would do them both on a map table and then they'd pop out the back door of No. 10 with a fiver each. On his death, two thousand black clad tarts processed silently and weeping down the Albany to mourn his passing. A grateful Commons voted unanimously, to waive the debts - but specifically didn't mention who the money was to go to in order not to embarass his mama, the Countess of Chatham. Here's a picture showing how good he was, literally shitting on the rest of parliament:

It reeks of Hollywood trying to get the Academy's attention, and it is exactly the kind of thing the trailers in Tropic Thunder made fun of.

The trailer looks amazing, except for the part where he says something like ""Will you stop interrupting me when I'm interrupting you?""  That always elicits an uproarious laughter from the audience, and it doesn't sit right with me.  The rest of the trailer was very serious and then this random joke of a line... maybe they're trying to establish Churchill as a formidable debater with a sense of humor, it still sticks out like a sore thumb in that trailer.

It makes me worry about the tone of the movie overall, that it might come off erratic and bipolar.  I hope in context that line comes off less cringey.  

And the final thing that I can think of is the release date.  January 12th?  Isn't a movie releasing in January a death sentence?

I'm not sure if the Sean Penn All the King's Men released in January, but I'm honestly getting a very All the King's Men vibe from this movie, as something that is being lauded on the surface for the cast and crew involved, but when you actually watch it, it is a total bust in every way.  I hope I'm wrong, because despite these worries I am still looking forward to it.&&""Winston Churchill said 'the eyes are the Windows of your face.'""

> Churchill was chicken little crying that the sky was falling.... right up until it actually did. It's difficult in a film to convey how silly what Churchill was saying was. It's be like North Korea conquering China.

This just has no basis even in hindsight. It's complete nonsense. Churchill during his wilderness was famously well-informed through what was essentially a network of spies all throughout the British defence and diplomatic establishment, led by [Desmond Morton.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Morton_%28civil_servant%29) He was one of the best-informed people in the entire world on the relative balance between Franco-British and German re-armament efforts. Any errors in his information were generally the same errors that were in Chamberlain's information. And Churchill was absolutely not wrong in noting that German re-armament was on a rapid pace to exceed Allied re-armament; this is the whole reason why the ""Phoney War"" happened, because the Allies were only strong enough to confidently defend, while they needed a year or two to build up strength before they could risk attacking.&&If he was right about the sky falling I don't see why him crying about it was bad&&[The other Churchill movie of 2017](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2674454/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) apparently wasn't very flattering.&&He is presented in ""Darkest Hour"" as flawed but heroic.

From the build-up, to the posters, to the trailers, everything looks like Oldman is going to give a career-defining performance in this film and that is what the film is about. It's not a Joe Wright movie or even a Winston Churchill movie, it's a Gary Oldman movie and I don't think we're ready for what he's bringing to the table with this one.&&The vast majority of people here in the UK glorify Boudicca as a British hero even though in her rebellion she had her army raid and exterminate a number of large British towns and their occupants, then got swiftly destroyed by the Romans.

So it should come as no surprise that Churchill of all fucking people will be glorified for fucking ever. You can thank the Victorians for this shitty nationalistic mindset.&&Honestly, I'd love to see a biopic along those lines - moving away from the hagiography, giving a bit more realistic portrayal of the man.&&I am not sure about the other items you've listed there. I know about India but not all these other records that show him as a war-monger, sell-out and war criminal. I guess Dresden for the Germans and the decision to sink the French fleet but the latter at least was because he was worried about them falling to the Nazis. Warmonger I guess is because he was advocating war against Hitler....

Churchill is propagated as national hero because of his role in WW2. It's difficult in hindsight to appreciate the impact he had on the British war effort, especially in the period after France had fallen but before the Americans arrived. He had serious flaws, maybe unforgivable ones, which are too often ignored but his role in history is not unjustified either. I am not aware of any serious historian who thinks his role in history is unjustified. &&I'm not sure how much of this is true and how much it is due to a world obsessed with pointing out flaws in anyone who had historical significance. People and politics were different then and it is wrong to try to compare him to a politician today. Almost any leader of a major power in those days had what would be considered a controversial set of morals today. And Churchill was no Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito, Franco or ten-a-penny South American dictator, you'll grant me that.&&You're absolutely right, in fact, he had very strong links to decisions that prevented aid going to millions of Indians suffering a famine whom died. Something about transporting vast quantities of food nearby all the way to Europe, I don't know the full details. &&I'm fairly sure that to folks that were alive in the war he was a national treasure and his speeches had the whole country listening to the radio and gave them hope where they had very little .

Winston Churhiĺl in the later years was preoccupied with acting like England was a superpower. It became an obsession that he nor his government appear weak on anything.

30 years prior he was protesting responsible government in India because he viewed them as property.&&I mean with taglines like ""the heart of a nation"" and this one, I really doubt they'll go into anything about that. &&Especially the fact that he himself was responsible for the death of millions of Indians. &&Yeah, hard for me to like the guy when you consider how he felt about Indians.

He was important and did some great things, I just don't like him&&Yeah, he was a crucial figure in 20th Century history but the veneration of Churchill is pretty distasteful, IMO. He's not well regarded here in Ireland since he unleashed the Black and Tans on the public, a state operated terrorist force that was more interested in butchering civilians than anything else. This says nothing of the shit he pulled in India, where I've heard his actions described as genocidal (though I don't know how well accepted that is academically).

What I don't understand is the desire to gloss over the awful shit he pulled. If anything, historical figures are far more interesting when they're responsible for both heinous and good acts.&&The director on the film being politically hijacked, 

> ""I don’t think anything like that will happen when anyone sees the film, to be honest. Churchill may have been co-opted or re-appropriated by certain factions in the rightwing spectrum, but I’m not sure that’s true to who he was and what he believed. There are a lot of his policies I vehemently disagree with, not least his position on women’s suffrage and, later, Indian independence, but there was a moment when he was right, and he resisted. The level of resistance he put up against bigotry and hate and totalitarianism is vital.""&&Yeah, I'm from Pakistan and while I admire Churchill for changing the course of the world for the better, he really had some shit things to say about the subcontinent.  

Also things like this:
> In 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""  

And this:

> Churchill has been criticised for advocating the use of chemical weapons - primarily against Kurds and Afghans.
""I cannot understand this squeamishness about the use of gas,"" he wrote in a memo during his role as minister for war and air in 1919.
""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes,"" he continued.

And when 3 million people died in Bengal because of a famine, he refused to send aid and blamed the Indians for the famine claiming they:
>""breed like rabbits""

On Gandhi:
> ""It is alarming and nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir… striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal Palace,"" Churchill said of his anti-colonialist adversary in 1931.
""Gandhi should not be released on the account of a mere threat of fasting,"" Churchill told the cabinet on another occasion. ""We should be rid of a bad man and an enemy of the Empire if he died.

He was witty, and ballsy, and smart, and charismatic, but he was also a wretched racist.&&LOL, we can dream. &&It's much more complicated than that. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/236bor/churchill_was_the_british_equivalent_of_mao_zedong/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/28tfqk/churchill_was_the_british_equivalent_of_hitler/) are a couple of /r/badhistory threads on it.

The TLDR is the bengal famine happened because of a large number of factors and the british could have done more to alleviate its effects, but they did not for a variety of reasons. It's just a really complicated topic. The wikipedia article is actually a good primer and summary.

A lot of the impetus for declaring Churchill a war criminal comes from books by Madhusree Mukerjee, an American jounralist with a physics degree and no training in history, so I would treat anything by her you come across with a lot of scrutiny.


(I copied this from below just because it also seemed relevant in this thread. I'm not trying to go around the whole thread defending Churchill who was by all accounts not the most morally pure person whatever his actions.)&&And how he wanted to gas Indians calling for independence &&[deleted]&&This is a complete lie! Was Churchill also a racist? Yes he was. But he NEVER let any notion of race influence his policies. The suggestion that, like Hitler, he purposefully manufactured a genocide to kill off people because he deemed them lower than himself is an absolute falsity.

In the article that spread this pernicious falsity it is claimed: """"Up to 3 million people starved to death while British officials begged Churchill to direct food supplies to the region. He bluntly refused. He raged that it was their own fault for ""breeding like rabbits"". At other times, he said the plague was ""merrily"" culling the population.""
This is absolute and utter nonsense. First of all, who caused the famine? The Japanese did by attacking Burma, which supplied the majority of grain for the region. Hindu merchants then hoarded the grain further exacerbating the shortage. Churchill appointed Wavell as Field Marshal, who mobilized the military to transport more food to the region. Churchill wrote to him:


""Peace, order and a high condition of war-time well-being among the masses of the people constitute the essential foundation of the forward thrust against the enemy….The hard pressures of world-war have for the first time for many years brought conditions of scarcity, verging in some localities into actual famine, upon India. Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages….Every effort should be made by you to assuage the strife between the Hindus and Moslems and to induce them to work together for the common good""


This wasn't exactly helped by the repeated strikes that Gandhi was calling, diverting divisions that could have been used to attack the Japanese. Nor did a huge cyclone that destroyed crops in 1942. Churchill's efforts were not enough. Next, Churchill turned to aid from other countries. Canada offered aid, but shipping from Canada would take 2 months, whereas shipping from Australia would take 3-4 weeks. So eventually Churchill wrote to Roosevelt, who had the ships available to take the grain from Austrialia to India:


""I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India….Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.


I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.""


Roosevelt said no. To accuse Churchill of not even trying to help, no, of trying to deliberately murder the Indians is a complete and utter falsity. Was he a racist? Yes. Did he ever letter racism colour his policy, which he frequently criticized Hitler of doing? No.


The man who spread this slander about Churchill is called Johann Hari. Unsurprisingly, he is repeatedly accused of plagiarism, leading to his suspension from the Independent, and enjoys editing the Wikipedia pages of anyone who criticizes him. To quote him "" I started to notice some things I didn’t like in the Wikipedia entry about me, so I took them out. To do that, I created a user-name that wasn’t my own. Using that user-name, I continued to edit my own Wikipedia entry and some other people’s too. I took out nasty passages about people I admire – like Polly Toynbee, George Monbiot, Deborah Orr and Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. I factually corrected some other entries about other people. But in a few instances, I edited the entries of people I had clashed with in ways that were juvenile or malicious: I called one of them anti-Semitic and homophobic, and the other a drunk. "".


Does that sound like a man who would make a balance judgement based on the evidence?

it doesn't look like it. he's made out to be some geopolitical rags to riches figurehead taking a morally superior choice and being the underdog. at least that's how the description sounds to me. and tbh i never expected churchill, on the opposite side of hitler, to be portrayed without some positive creative touches in a movie in the first place.&&It's more of the fact that people nowadays can't understand the consequences of war and what was happening. 


The world was at war, decisions had to be made. Sometimes good decisions led to the bad. He kept Britain going by making solid decisions even if they had knock on consquences. 


Special snowflakes don't really know the reality of things because they are too young to understand. I'm 25 and can understand that not everyone can be saved.  


The Bengal famine is a highly debated historical issue, but people just point fingers at Churchill even though there were many factors that caused it.&&Yes he didn’t kill his own people. But he did kill them brown skinned ‘fakirs’. 
&&From the other side of the world, here in India, it wasn't too pleasent. 

Whike Churchill talked about democracy and freedom in his speeches in England, he denied it to us Indians, insulted us, took away our food and money and used us a war financing machine. 

The hope that Churchill gave to England was made on the stage constructed of dead bodies of my ancestors. &&I mean, I'm only using anecdotal evidence here and I understand how insignificant that can be, but both my great-grandfathers as well as my step-great-grandfather fought in WW2 and all described Churchill as some variant of 'just another elitist wine-supping Tory pig'.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkTw3_PmKtc&t=52s&&Yea. I'm really excited to see this. If anybody deserves an oscar it's Gary. He's been my favorite actor  and inspiration for years and years.

 I can't tell you how many times I've watched Bram Stokers Dracula or The Fifth element. Prisoner of Askaban is my favorite Harry Potter , mainly cause of him. I also love The Contender if anyone hasn't seen that, watch it. Great political movie. 


 &&It's inevitable he wins for this. Doesn't matter who else is nominated.&&Killing Them Softly was the role that convinced me to keep a closer eye on the dude. Everyone kills it in that movie.&&Also Bloodline, he was great in that. I wanna rewatch A Place Beyond the Pines now though!&&I had no clue he was even in that. I didn't learn his name until Bloodline, at that point I'm sure I've probably seen him in many movies without realizing who he was. &&First movie I saw him in was The Year My Voice Broke. Would have been nearly 30 years since he made that movie.  Loved him as that teen larrikin. He said there was a time when the roles dried up and he was washing dishes etc. Great to see his successes now.&&2econded.  Love Mendo. &&His vocal work is some of the best in acting. He really nails everything given to him (helps he has had good roles written).&&He's unbelievable in Bloodline. &&He hired a team of Cubans to tuck him in at night every evening.  &&Yes, just think of all the lives ruined by sharing a joke you heard somewhere else.&&who cares?&&Watch it get gold too now.&&r/karmacourt&&Thanks, your contribuition just made the world a better place.&&Heard Daniel day Lewis is play as the cigar && Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass.&&Rob Schneider is... a bowtie.&&Nah, it's just the UK release date.

This is not a US poster.&&Oldman is great, no doubt, but shouldn't we be giving the makeup guys the mad props for Oldman's unrecognizability in Hannibal?&&Seen that movie several times, never knew it was Gary Oldman.&&You can see him transform from playing slightly mad, crazy haired dudes into serious, taking no shit dudes.  
  
Churchill is like the exteme of this.&&Gary Oldman was that guy in Quest for Camelot???????????&&I always loved his role in Air Force One. 

Not the best movie ever made but Gary Oldman stole every scene he was in.&&I feel like the HMU folks should get at least *some* of the credit.&&1992.

He's damn chameleon. I [barely recognized him](https://cdn1.gomoviesgo.com/movies/1230103786-poster-Beethoven.jpg).&&**Immortal Beloved** (1994)&&1994 (great year)

The ticks, the gait, the accent. Unreal. &&!Remindme 1 year&&I need to finish watching that show. So good, just so busy lately that I've been watching things that are more mindless/don't require much attention. &&Yes. The point is that anyone playing Churchill has massive shoes to fill, even by recent adaptations. It's a VERY high bar to leap. &&BunyipPouch is just trying to save the books, man.&&Can you make a live reaction video of you watching Tiptoes?&&I've seen it and I am not sure if it was just a fever dream or not&&He was fantastic in The Crown.

>Never give up. Never give in.

It's clearly just a film about the events of WWII...

>During the early days of World War II, the fate of Western Europe hangs on the newly-appointed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Hitler, or fight on against incredible odds.

...told in a completely unbiased manner that certainly doesn't glorify a person who many consider to be terrible person that did many horrific unjustifiable acts and is beloved mostly by comparison to Hitler and for fighting Nazis.&&yeah i'm sure it'll tackle the willful genocide of indians he caused through starvation.

I trust Gary Oldman and Joe Wright though. &&>Winston Churhiĺl in the later years was preoccupied with acting like England was a superpower.

They did show that on the Crown though.
&&From the tagline and paragraph description it already sounds like American sniper levels of nationalistic propaganda:

>Never give up. Never give in.

>During the early days of World War II, the fate of Western Europe hangs on the newly-appointed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Hitler, or fight on against incredible odds.&&..&&I've not heard about this. Can you give any insights about it? &&And his military career is littered with what we would call war crimes. Early on in his career he participated in the destruction of entire towns in what is now Afghanistan. They would burn all the buildings down, destroy all the crops, kill all the livestock, fill up the wells, and kill anyone they came across. Later on in his career in what is now Iraq he would order the same, except this time airplaines would be used. Just Indiscriminately bomb entire villages. &&Plenty of evidence this isn't true though many Indian Nationalist sources claim the contrary.

""I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India….Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.

I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.""

&&He and the entire British War cabinet and government. Giving Churchill total responsibility for the Bengal Famine seems to ignore the fact that he was not Dictator of Britain.&&About 30 years before, HG Wells - you know, War of the Worlds guy, nice old-school sci-fi writer - wrote about how Nazi-style eugenics was a great idea for the world of the future. 

We massively underestimate the power of shifting public opinion. What's unconscionably evil to anyone with a soul today is yesterday's slightly radical dinner-party conversation. 

&&Name a historical figure you like who doesn't have any dirty laundry.&&As someone from the UK, it pisses me off how his obvious qualities as a war leader seem to excuse the dark shit he did. The man subscribed whole heartedly to to imperialism and everything it entailed, even in 1945 when the writing was well and truly on the wall.

I wouldn't say his veneration is wholly distasteful, because as a figure he was instrumental in resisting the axis, but at the same time, that veneration shouldn't be founded on ignorance. We should be critical of him, because his career is full of questionable and indefensible decisions. A negative or at the very least an honest account might help in rowing back on the years of white-washing.

Your final point is spot on though. I prefer to look at him as a 20th century Cromwell. Brilliant, but undeniably a monster.&&Huh, TIL Black and Tan is more than just a drink.&&The level of resistance he put up against bigotry? Cmon- the man literally starved 4 million people to death intentionally because he saw them as subhuman. That’s almost 1/2 the holocaust, and he did that in 1 year! 

Edit: let me be clear-  the actions of the colonial proofs should not be taken as a reflection on the British of today, who are by and large, wonderful people with a great sense of compassion. &&Churchill was a hateful bigot.&&That statement sounds a lot worse when you don't specify it to be tear gas. Still not a nice thing to suggest, but no where near as bad as using lethal gas.&&Well we have actual quotes on this matter. He did it because he was racist&&And would've saved a ton of lives in doing so.&&He also wanted to get into a full scale war with USSR in 1945, right after the end of WW2 with a [surprise attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable) on soviet positions in Germany.

""I've been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say, 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy.""

Are we now also ignoring the Japanese occupation of Burma (which had been the region's major breadbasket) and the Japanese armies advancing on India? And the fact that the nominally British armies defending India were mostly Indians?

> In 1943, some 3 million brown-skinned subjects of the Raj died in the Bengal famine, one of history's worst. Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.

India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians.

It was a genocide, and it should be judged in the same way as the Western World treats Holodomor.

Some people choose to absolve Churchill of his role in the famine by pushing the blame onto his nutter friend Frederick Lindemann, but ultimately Churchill's rabid racism made it far easier for him to rationalise those anti-Indian decisions with led to the death of millions of people.

After rightfully taking the flak for the disaster at Gallipoli he resigned from government and served in the Western Front in the trenches. He was quite willing himself to make the sacrifice and put himself in the firing line, and of all the valid criticisms that can be made towards Churchill I don't think it is fair to say that he regarded troops as cannon fodder.  

edit: interestingly enough though he wasn't overly popular with British troops during WW2, but mostly due to his habit of smoking cigars and drinking brandy while officers and enlisted men had to go with inferior or no tobacco, and all alcohol from what they could scavenge or procure themselves. &&He was of the opinion that if they went to war with the USSR, which was inevitable according to him and almost every other western head of state, they should do it immediately because the Soviets would only get stronger.

It also was planned at a time when the USSR had not committed troops to fighting the Japanese and the intentions of the USSR were unknown.

Not saying it's all black and white,but Churchill is at least partially to blame for the deaths of millions.

*Volunteered* is a wrong word, colonialism isn't compatible with volunteering. The Canadians and Aussies volunteered, the Indians did not.

Churchill has been attributed to many racist statements (unanimously). His views on Indians haven't changed between different reports.

What does this have to do with a country occupying another for 200 years, colonizing it and then systemically looting it for its own good. 

What an independent India would have done if the Japan invaded was none of Britain's business. &&No mate. No. No. No. Why is this bit of history just ignored?  Is it not significant? &&I don't know if it's the same in the UK (I assume it is given Australian law is based off it) but in Australia deaths resulting from ""reckless indifference to human life"" are classified as murder.

You may not be bloodying your hands but you killed them all the same.

Then again, in war no one is. But that should mean that they're studied for what they are. Not what you want to see as them. &&In my defense I was jogging and I tend to zone out for stretches of minutes at a time. Flimsy defense I know. I vaguely recall the topic but I can't remember any specifics. &&Thing is though, other than being a great speechmaker, Churchill did little to win the war. He made awful financial decisions like putting Britain on the gold standard which ruined our economy pre-ww2 and purchasing outdated tanks. He wasn't even the conservative's leader of choice. Yes he was in power and the war was won with him as leader, but I think people tend to exaggerate the good he actually did due to his status as a propagdanda-like hero for the poeple at the time.&&It was always mania. But it was mania that was fortunately at the right time and place. Never surrender was not propaganda, it was a doctrine. Britain was prepared to go down fighting for every inch of the country. He fortified the entire country, created hundreds of miles of defensive pill boxes all with overlapping fields of fire, hundreds of miles of fortifications against tanks, hundreds of miles of [stop-lines](http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/psgwordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/StoplineNew.jpg).

Britain was set up to fight until nothing was left to fight for. Anyone going into Britain was going into a fight that would require beating the entire country. Surrender or defeat+occupation weren't part of any plans at all. There was no contingency. It was victory or death.

He was mad. But that madness would have protected Britain, the wargames after WW2 showed that British plans for defence against invasion were absurdly more robust than the invasion plans the Germans never got around to using. They were crushed in the games.

>Of the 90,000 German troops who landed only 15,400 returned to France. 33,000 were taken prisoner, 26,000 were killed in the fighting and 15,000 drowned in the English Channel. All six umpires deemed the invasion a resounding failure.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion_(wargame)

And even had the Navy not stopped the second wave of the German invasion, it absolutely was not large enough to contend with the insane quantity of defences Churchill had built. They would have gotten 50 miles into the country before the full reinforcement of the 1.5million home guard were on them.

Ozymandias will always be the finest hour of television, in my opinion.&&I’m surprised they said anything at all. Now the whole world knows there’s at least one complete full resolution (and whatever current highest sound quality is)  movie file hidden somewhere.&&Here's the thing. John Williams is scoring the film. He prefers to work with a locked image. If you give him a locked picture and two months, he's can make stuff like the original Star Wars, Raiders, Superman, Schindler's List, Harry Potter, etc.

If you don't, you'll get something like Star Wars prequels.

It's hard to understand for people, because a lot of them don't even appreciate music. You can't do it if the cut is changing. It's not so easy to change your piece once it's in your head. Composers need a locked picture.

Music is incredibly important in film. It being left out and/or shitty is why a lot of modern films simply don't have the same effect like older ones. They are lacking an entire realm of storytelling. 

Take [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wJa1L1ZCqU) for example. I'm refering specifically to the last minute. Try watching it without sound. It drags on and on and on. It must've been a pain to edit and to envision it with music. 

Now watch it with sound. The music does all the work. Luke doesn't say a thing, but you know everything that's going through his head. And if you watch the rest of the movie, the theme will never repeat itself this way. It evolves and changes, just like the character. Luke is never again a lonely boy dreaming of big things. It's only in this scene. 

This is what's lacking today. Directors not leaving room for music to tell the story along the picture, and wanting composers to score to image that's not locked, and then cutting their music. That sure is doable, but you don't get the same thing. It can never be. 

Take Inception for example. Or any Hans Zimmer score (I'm giving an example, this is especially noticeable in Batman). None of the themes evolve. They stay the same. Inception has a few themes that appear in the same way, structurally and harmonically. Same for Batman, it's always that crescendo-decrescendo in horns playing D and F. Even as Bruce overcomes his fears, finds his true self, his music stays the same - it's not saying anything. 

Inception wasn't even scored. Hans and his team wrote a bunch of demos that Nolan then cut the movie to. These are just instrumental pieces. Don't get me wrong, it's great music. It's super cool. It works lovely as standalone music in an album, even in concert (Coachella anyone?). Tunes from Inception have millions of views and streams. But that's just it. It's just music (great nonetheless), not a filmscore.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to say that if you're having John Williams score your movie, you make sure that he has a locked picture in his hands for at least two months.

JJ may be predictable, but he gets believable performances out of even the most bland and unskilled actors. He's great at ensemble casts, which Star Wars is known for. Colin Trevorrow managed to get a wooden performance ot of one of the most animated new leads in recent years (Pratt) in JW.

Both as a brand and as something the execs have their own personal connection with. It's not some random superhero property or novel adaptation. It's Star Wars.  If the director is anything short of excellent then they have to make the hard choice and protect the brand. And unfortunately there's no way of knowing who's going to be a good director. On paper, Lord/Miller looked fine. In practice, they were dicks who took the piss. Treverow seemed like he'd be competent, but he turned out to be a bit rubbish who'd just been lucky. 

The main difference between the successful directors (Abrams, Johnson) and the least successful (Lord, Miller, Treverow) seems to be ego. You have to have a monster of an unhealthy ego to be a film director. But the good directors were still able to put Star Wars first. My impression of the other guys is that while they were sure keen on Star Wars, at the end of the day they thought themselves bigger than Star Wars with the attitudes they took. Ironically Abrams and Johnson are a cut above anyone else that's been attached to the franchise (save for Ron Howard), but they're the ones who come across as the most respectful. &&Yeah but that's easy to do when there aren't even any others around to watch.&&Then he also said to watch Monday night football on 10/9 when someone asked when the last trailer was coming out. &&You try when it's sitting on top of the front page calling your name.&&That's how I'm going in: haven't even seen the trailer.

If they've really finished three months early? They must be very happy with it.

**George Lucas, haha.*&&Not op, but I'd say that if they're not in panic mode-- still fixing, reshooting, etc-- they must think Johnson delivered what they wanted.  &&with the nature of the blockbuster movies nowadays, studios will often be in post-production up until the 11th hour, literally within days/weeks of the movie being released. this is to give them more time to spend brushing up cgi, vfx, and sometimes editing. to stop post now, with so many months, is basically stating you think the movie is 'perfect', or at the very least that it can't be made better.&&Thats no moon.....&&Where can one find these rumors?

you can shit all you want over the prequels, but the music isn't subpar to the original movies. TFA Soundtrack on the other hand...
&&Hold on... are you trying to say the prequels soundtracks were sub par? Because you are objectively wrong. If Duel of the Fates, Battle of the Heroes, and Across the Stars are not in your top 10 Star Wars soundtrack list, I don't even know what to say to you.&&The Batman v Superman score showed a lot of development in Zimmer's style. The Superman theme from Man of Steel is manipulated depending on the situation, often changed and misrepresented to show the way Clark is perceived by the public and Batman. The links between that theme and Lex and Doomsday's respective themes raises some interesting questions as well.

The use of the themes from Man of Steel, particularly from the scene of Lara's death to Martha's being threatened, the battle between Zod and Clark being reused in the BvS fight showing that Batman is becomig what he feared all along; all of these show thematic and character evolution.

Finally, the integration of the Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman themes in the second half of ""Is She With You?"" (People only remember the Wondy bit) shows the characters' cohesion.

It's a far more advanced score than Zimmer has ever done; it's a shame it gets so overlooked just because people don't appreciate the film.&&Picture lock happens wayyyy before post processing starts dude.

I don't know why but when people say things like this (about whatever subject) it makes me irrationally angry.  

What makes me even more annoyed though is you hijacked a post not directly related to the music and started with ""here's the thing"" like someone was previously discussing the topic and you're clarifying. I know why you did this, timing is convenient to your opinion, and you took the opportunity given, but the way you started your comment says a lot about you and what was coming.

>This is what's lacking today.

No it isn't, no more ""lacking"" than it was in 1977.  SW was not part of an entire industry that used music to convey feeling and move plot, as it is today, there were countless examples of good and bad use of music.

>Music is incredibly important in film. It being left out and/or shitty is why a lot of modern films simply don't have the same effect like older ones. They are lacking an entire realm of storytelling.

Two things, since we are being so specific.

First, it depends on the film, the plot and other factors.  Music cannot carry a film on it's own and it doesn't always have cause. Second, this false history you are claiming is kind of silly. In combination with what I said above, you are using a singular example (Williams and Star Wars) as a global (the ""past"") and then comparing it to ""all"" modern giving room for exceptions in the past and none for our modern age.  That's just lazy and wrong. There are plenty of examples of wonderful music in story telling/carrying films in modern times, you are either ignoring them, or you haven't seen them and my bet is on the former. 

I love John Williams and proper use of music in movies but fuck me if you are not coming off as a pretentious sod who just signed up for music academy.

I know I am being the asshole here, but the way you framed your entire comment bugged me.
&&> If you don't, you'll get something like Star Wars prequels.

But the music in the Prequels was actually really good. Probably the best bit about the Prequels. &&I think the prequels have a great score. *The Force Awakens*, on the other hand, was the first Star Wars film where I can't remember a single piece. &&The only thing going through my head during the amazing spiderman 1 was ""god damn this music sucks.""

I'm refering specifically to the last minute. Try watching it without sound.

I ... I ... uh ... *I can't.*

I turned the sound off, *but I still hear the music*. 

I was five when *Star Wars* came out, and that music is burned into my soul.

It's essentially the entire series' climax. It's so intense and incredible because of the emotional journey you've been on with these characters and the investment you've made into this story.

Especially in Attack of the Clones. That's because the edit changed after John Williams already scored the film. 

So, for example, John Williams didn't make any music for the droid factory sequence.

IIRC, the composer which was not John Williams had only a month to do it.&&He's not criticizing the soundtrack itself, it's about the *way it's used*.

Watch the binary sunset scene that he linked to from ANH and then think about the prequels. There aren't very many scenes like it, where the music tells the story.&&Oh yeah, I think it is a solid contender for worst soundtrack in the series.  

So bland next to his other work.  &&TFA had a great soundtrack...Rey's theme is one of the best.&&Exactly, you named only 3 pieces from 3 movies. I love these pieces too, but the **score** is nothing compared to the original Star Wars. 

Notice what I said about Inception - great music, bad score. It doesn't tell a story. It says one thing and repeats it, screaming it louder every time - the music, the harmony never changes.

Original Star Wars is so well written that it works in concert, and you can hear the whole movie in it - because it evolves. What other themes do you remember from the prequels, and how do they evolve?

Like, come on dude. Superman has a pieces that accentuate and harmonize with tonalities in HUMAN CONVERSATION and is accenting and suggestive in that manner. 

If you go to a Star Wars concert, you'll never hear anything from prequels besides these 3 pieces. But you'll hear The Force theme, Imperial March, Leia's Theme, Yoda's Theme, Sand People, Asteroid Field, The Throne Room, Cantina Band, Victory Celebration, just to name a few.

And beside being great concert music, it also **works flawlessly as a score**. That's what's so great about it.&&Sure, but I've heard horror stories about Disney/Lucasfilm going in and changing things after ""picture lock"" and even after ""sound lock"" which kind of kills the whole point of the concept. Not to mention makes it much harder to score to or do sound design and mixing around&&I meant music in films, [but you made me chuckle](http://i.imgur.com/eTjSvVS.gifv)

&&He's not saying that the music was bad; he is saying that the *score* is not as good.

Music is what you get when a bunch of people play instruments (and possibly sing).  Score is what you get when you apply music to scenes in the movie.

You are absolutely correct that the music was really good.  However, the score always felt a bit...off.  Not bad by any means, but nowhere near as tight as in the OT.&&Reshoots happen during post-production.  So do test screenings incidentally, which is why when you hear someone talk about them they usually mention the FX weren't done.  Once post-production is locked, that's pretty much it.

P.S. I loved Chronicle, but I doubt something like that would translate well into SW.&&This sort of shit happen all the time, we just don't pay attention for other movies. The #1 movie of the last two weekend (IT) was directed by a guy who had to come in weeks before production began.

It's the TV model you get a producer in charge of the season, and guest directors to shoot the individual episode. &&It is not like the movie Josh Trank was hired for is even happening at the moment.&&They come in waves. Each wave is supposed to convince the less interested. Some big movies have the final wave on release day or just before with tv spots and trailers that show EVERYTHING. They're just going to start revealing more and more from this point hoping the cool moments will attract those on the fence into a theater seat.

You're not one of those on the fence people. These trailers aren't made for you. The teaser was for you. The next ones will give things away that will subtract from the magic of opening as you sit in the seat waiting for the next big plot point or location to show up. Maybe the trailer shows Luke and Kylo clashing sabers on an icy planet. You'll have that image in the back of your mind, distracting you through the movie until it happens. If you see an ice planet you'll know its getting close and our combatants are both going to have to arrive soon if they're not there already.

Ep.7 I took in everything I could. Soundtrack, map of galaxy on toy box, tv spots, trailers, interviews, behind the scenes. On opening night I knew virtually the whole plot. Listen to Hamill.

Ozymandias wasn't just another episode, though. It was basically the penultimate scene of the movie.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Me too. It's gonna be hard to avoid them, since it's gonna get circulated on social media all the time. But I was in the same camp as you for episode 7. I loved the trailers though. Great marketing and the buzz it created was phenomenal. (Just looking at Comic-Con, talk shows and merchandise. People were already buying BB-8 pillows before even meeting the character in the film).

But looking at the trailers, it's easy to piece together the movie. Lone character on desert planet. One stormtrooper on a desert planet. At one point he removes that storm trooper suit on the desert planet, meets girl and travel in the Millenium Falcon.

One planet with a forest and some temple stuff amongst the x-wings. Probably the same one they go to with Han Solo that gets attacked.

Snow planet. First order base. We also see snow in the duel between Finn and Kylo and deduce that this is the same place. 

Star Wars' gallery of planets, locations and characters are too iconic that it's hard to not see the structure of it all. However, the surprises that were there were amazing, and so was everything I didn't know.

I've always thought it should have won an Oscar, but I'm guessing it had too many elements from ANH's score to be considered ""original"".&&That sequence is always one of the moments from Empire that I anticipate the most when rewatching, and that's entirely because of the score. It gives me chills everytime I hear it. It's just amazing what it adds.&&[deleted]&&I knew a dude who worked in music engineering who has worked under Hanz Zimmer. He said that the crew likes him a lot but he works them pretty intense. There were a few weeks at a time where he spent the night under his desk.&&March of the Resistance, man. With the X-Wings coming in over the water... &&March of the Resistance and The Jedi Steps are great too.&&""The Jedi Steps"" is second only to ""The Asteroid Field"" as best music of the entire saga.

Of course you may not remember it because it's literally ninety seconds long, but that kind of makes it better. They didn't capitalize on it. We'll probably never hear it again. It was just brilliant music for an iconic scene.&&I agree that it might not have so many 'big hitters' compared to other Star Wars soundtracks, but the way John weaved the traditional Star Wars songs into new songs, such as in the The Jedi Steps and Finale, was fairly masterful. At least in my opinion.&&How did you even find that podcast?
&&This has been an interesting and nuanced argument. Thanks.&&Like 40 years to late For that man. &&*I don't like sand ;)&&It's rough and course &&There was a theory a few years back that he was actually intended to be a Sith Lord, sort of akin to Yoda but for the dark side. You can find info on it on the interwebs. I believe it personally, I think Lucas just got cold feet about the whole thing when he saw the reaction to the character was so negative. But if he had stuck it out, I think the prequels would have been better for it. &&I don't like his opinion. It's coarse and rough. And it gets everywhere.&&That's a good trick!&&Mickey: ""Ha*ha*HAh*a*.... Ok kids, break his knee caps""

I put FBI first then I'm like, uhh that's not it, so I put CIA and called it a day lol&&That's where I draw the line &&>But I was in the same camp as you for episode 7. I loved the trailers though. Great marketing and the buzz it created was phenomenal.

I have good memories of the Great Force Awakens Hype-Train of 2015, participating in discussions, making predictions, and getting a little choked up at the trailers.  I remember saying before the movie came out, TFA could tank, but I'd still have the memory of these wonderful trailers.&&Thank you <3

Edit: There's a lot of interesting discussion around this. I might listen to the whole episode. Thanks again&&..... I need to rewatch Breaking Bad&&I think when Todd murders Jesses (ex?) girlfriend is the most tragic part. Not even because of Jesses reaction, but because she was never involved in the first place. I had to stop watching for a while after that, ever though there was only one episode left. Depressingly dark.&&Most tragic moment is Andreas death&&It blows my mind that the guy from Malcolm in the middle and various silly characters on shows like King of Queens and Seinfeld became Walter White in breaking bad. &&Apparently the idea is that Ozymandius is the real finale, and the remaining episode(s) are epilogue.&&And when he calls Skylar and knows the cops are listening and says a bunch of hurtful things to get Skylar out of any trouble. I thought that was his finest moment. For an actor to be able to show anger and truly mean it, but to also be crying and completely sad because of that is masterful.&&Man that reminds me of my friends wife and Dark Knight Rises. So they go for the movie and we meet them after for a bite and some coffee. The guy has a smug look on his face and his wife is looking really sheepish and embarrassed. He finally bursts out laughing and then proceeds to tell us that midway through the movie, she asked him ""who is this gotham guy they're trying to save?"" because in the movie, the characters keep saying ""we need to save gotham"". 

He probably had to sleep on the couch that night.&&r/breakingbad was so much fun to follow throughout the show. So much great OC, especially there last two seasons. The Belize/Billy's comment had met on the floor with a cramped stomach. &&Link?&&Looks like it might sadly be a (very funny) troll post.

Like we’re so good (which they were) that we can experiment SUPER wildly and you’ll still eat it up. 

Retrospectively I think i would’ve love it had it come at a different part of the series. &&TIL I learned that The Walking Dead is one big Bottle Episode.&&[deleted]&&Which I think kinda fits what we could expect from The Last Jedi, given Johnson has said it really doesn't pull punches, and is very much from the 'Strikes Back' ilk.

&&I'm always excited to see Goggins getting more roles ever since I saw him in Justified. I don't think I've disliked any role I've seen him in so far.&&Richard Gere looks like Ian Mckellen here&&I really enjoy seeing Dinklage get roles that have little or nothing to do with his height. He's such a good actor, really deserves it. &&I'm always a little dubious when I hear ""from the producer of"" in promo material.&&God I love Walton Goggins. I've been defending him to my friends group for an insanely long time as an underrated and heavily ignored actor. His work on ""the shield"" and ""Sons of Anarchy"" is what first made me notice, but seeing him in ""Django Unchained"" and ""Vice Principals"" was when I really cemented that opinion.&&[The Dollop episode](http://thedollop.net/wp/episode-93-smollop/) about the Three Christs of Ypsilanti is worth a listen.

&&Jesus Christs, when did Richard Gere get so old?&&Just attended a private screening at TIFF (Scotia Theatre 4, 11:30am). 

I enjoyed the film. Can post more details if there is interest.&&I'll watch anything with Goggins. Dudes a fucking dynamo. &&I worked on this movie for a few days! I think it's gonna be good!&&It works, mate! The fat one balances out the two skinny ones!&&Jon Avnet has produced some great things and he has directed some of the worst movies I have ever seen. No thank you. &&Oh man I was upset when I saw this was coming out, I live by Ypsilanti where the true events actually happened and one of my Psych professors taught all of his classes about this study and it struck me so much I actually wrote up a script for a comedy based off the book but I kept telling myself ""Noone wants to see a comedy about messiah complexes and mental illness"" but damn I was wrong &&Unrelated, but last year I wrote a script based on this story. &&Walton Goggins is an under rated actor.

&&Walton Goggins is so criminally underrated, especially when he's not being type cast as ""southern tough guy"". His role as Venus Van Dam on Sons of Anarchy was especially complex on a show that wasn't exactly known for its deep characters, and it all started as a joke.&&Is this an adaptation of [die Physiker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists)?&&I'm thinking of the place where Cosmo Lavish ends up in Terry Pratchett's Making Money. &&Met the son of the researcher, Rocheach, back in 1972.

I am perfectly willing to believe that Peter Dinklage is Jesus Christ.&&It's great to see Richard Gere back in a major movie again - after being blacklisted by China...&&Three great actors, I can't wait for this one!&&Goggins is so good in everything he does. &&Anything with Walton Goggins is worth watching &&Oh, I thought about writing a short film about this case when I read about it years ago.

I just dont legitimately see this much interest for this film in amyway.&&I'm excited for everything except Gere.&&I always thought this would make a good movie. Fingers crossed!

EDIT: Yikes, this guy's only film that gets more than a seven on imdb is Fried Green Tomatoes. 

Fingers crossed really really tightly. 
&&expectations are high for this much coveted difficult adaptation&&Looks like the New Hampshire era Walter White sitting in the background. &&Goggins looks so different with a beard. I'm glad to see him in a more prominent role where he's not another southern racist haha&&Goggins hasn't aged in twenty years.&&is that the guy from korn in the background?&&Well this is a shame, I like most of those actors but can barely watch Richard Gere&&Had no idea Richard Gere was this old. I think the only film he's been in that I've seen is *Mothman*, years ago, and he didn't look a day older than 40 in that. Time really flies.&&I don't want to be that guy, but why do people care if a film was directed by someone who produced a certain film?   &&I'll watch anything with Walton Goggins in it. &&Walton Goggins is a hell of an actor, and has a really sad story behind him.&&Bradly Whitford is my boy &&I would watch these three in literally any movie @_@&&ZZZZZzzzzzz...&&There is a podcast episode on this.

I remember a story like this in real life where 2 patients who thought they were Jesus were placed together in hopes they would realize they can't both be thinking the same person.  Ended with them convincing each other that one of them was Jesus and the other was John the baptist.&&I need this in my life&&The book is amazing. &&Walton Goggins was one of those actors who had small roles and he made each one memorable but not enough to remember his name until his role on  The Shield. Holy shit, that guy can act! So glad to see him getting bigger and better roles. &&Goggins is fucking awesome!&&Oh man, I was worried that we were going to run out of Ian McKellens soon, but it looks like we got it covered. It's perfect, because I already thought we had plenty of Richard Geres.&&Black Swan was a garbage movie. I don't understand why everyone went crazy for it. Stuff acting, horrible story, even the overhyped sex scene was boring.&&I'm really glad Walton Goggins is getting better roles.  He plays a good ""good ol' boy"" but his talent is much greater.&&I love that this is coming out - especially cause Ypsi is my hometown.&&be really brave and call it the three allahs somehow i dont think it would go down with as many gunshots&&This was a pretty interesting case study. Looking forward to it. &&This is based off of a book about 3 real cases. It's an excellent book and I'm super excited to see it's going to be made into a film!&&in my experience if a movie advert namedrops ""from the producer of...""  the movie sucks.  

however usually the movie it mentions is good, and i stopped watching aronofsky movies long ago.  so maybe in this case because it's basically reversed this movie ""Three Christs"" might actually be worth considering.&&The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada

The city I mean, not the hospital... &&[Based on a true story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Christs_of_Ypsilanti)

> Rokeach got the idea from an article in Harper's Magazine describing two women who both believed they were the Virgin Mary. After being assigned as psychiatric hospital roommates, one of the women recovered from her delusion as a result of conversations with the roommate and was discharged.[2] As a similar study of delusional belief systems, Rokeach brought together three men who each claimed to be Jesus Christ and confronted them with one another's conflicting claims, while encouraging them to interact personally as a support group. Rokeach also attempted to manipulate other aspects of their delusions by inventing messages from imaginary characters. He did not, as he had hoped, provoke any lessening of the patients' delusions, but did document a number of changes in their beliefs.

> While initially the three patients quarreled over who was holier and reached the point of physical altercation, they eventually each explained away the other two as being patients with a mental disability in a hospital, or dead and being operated by machines.[3] The graduate students who worked with Rokeach on the project have been strongly critical of the morality of the project because of the amount of dishonesty and manipulation by Rokeach and the amount of distress experienced by the patients.[2] Rokeach added a comment in the final revision of the book that, while the experiment did not cure any of the three Christs, ""It did cure me of my godlike delusion that I could manipulate them out of their beliefs.""[2]&&TIL that Ypsilanti isn't a place in Finland like I'd just assumed when I first heard about this years ago.&&Plot Twist: Dr. Stone is the real Christ.&&Charlotte Hope from GoT too, nice.&&Wow, I used to work at that hospital.&&I remember reading about this case and thought it would be a funny movie. There were some pretty hilarious interactions between the three of them. &&Bradley Whitford looks like Mike from Breaking Bad now. &&I've known a few school principals who thought they were God Almighty.

Huh didn't know that. &&[deleted]&&Watch *The Shield.*&&He is amazing in Vice Principals &&He was in one of the top episodes of Community season 5, too.&&He was amazing in Justified.  One of my fave shows ever. &&I remember Goggins and Dinklage competed for the Supporting Actor Emmy for their roles in Justified and Game of Thrones respectively. 

Dinklage won, but if I'm honest I liked Goggins better.&&His role in American Ultra was strange and hilarious&&I am reminded of a story, or a rumor, that in the late 90's after starring in The Commish, Michael Chiklis was upset at his agent/agency because he hadn't broken into movies yet.  He said that by Bruce Willis' third year on Moonlighting, he was already starring in Die Hard. And he told his agent *""Where's my Die Hard?!""*

And The Shield was a show meant to make Chiklis a star, and he was recognized immediately winning a Best Actor award at the Emmys and Golden Globes the first couple of years. Its probably the main reason why he was cast as The Thing in Fantastic Four.

I also remember Walton Goggins winning an Academy Award way back in 2004/2005 for Best Short Film. And I find it ironic that Goggins was the one who slowly worked his way from the first days of the FX cable channel to starring in A-list movies. Love the guy.&&No love for his character Venus Van Dam in Sons of Anarchy?&&Hes my dream cast for bullseye in daredevil.&&I wonder if his nickname as a kid was ever ""Wallygog""..

Side note, ever heard of a Golliwog?&&Walton Goggins is bae. I think he's due some bigger roles, loved him in Justified even when the narrative got tired.&&Weirdly he popped up in *GI JOE: Retaliation* and was still fantastic.&&He has reached wizard age and I kind of want to see that now that I think about it.&&He already had like 30 years of grey haired handsomeness, it's only fair.&&Is it make up, or has he gotten really old recently?&&And a bit like Harrison Ford in his Wikipedia profile photo:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere&&Meanwhile, Walton Goggins looks like Ben Folds&&I've loved the way he has played the downtrodden dwarf in a non-PC world (in GoT of course). The performance he has given has been an actual inspiration to anyone who feels like they can't get ahead. Owning your disability and strengthening the parts of you that do work is a great life lesson.

Granted it's a show about dragons but my real world experience isn't much different from Tyrion's. I love the way they wrote that character and how he performs it.&&[deleted]&&He have been pretty vocal of it in the past, and have turned down lot of roles that basically just was ""this is a short guy"". In his Golden Globe acceptance speech he talk about a man with dwarfism that got grabbed and thrown by a drunk dude in a bar.&&He's actually done a pretty good job getting roles like that&&And it's a realistic portrayal of that kind of person - just as ordinary as anyone else

Actual little people don't spend all day talking about how small they are, like that's their only quality. But movies often reduce a character to just one thing and everything they do relates to that.&&Him in X Men was great. &&It's really an unavoidable issue though. You can't just cast Little Person James Bond. Audiences would notice. I don't think you would be able to get away with just casting someone with a disability and then thinking you can just never mention it or have any kind of focus on it in the film.&&I mean, he intentionally has not taken any roles as an elf. He is very adamant about it, so it's not like some big coincidence.&&He was easily the best part of Knight of Badassdom. His height never came up: he was just a guy who liked to take shrooms and LARP.&&His role in Game of Thrones has probably been the first dwarf role that isn't a gimmick. Thankfully now he's in a position to be a cash cow. &&You should watch ""Living in Oblivion"", which has a young(er) Dinklage in the third part of the story playing an actor in a very typical 90's indie movie where he goes on a tirade about how shitty and cliche it is to use dwarfs in dream sequences and to otherwise lend an aspect of ""edginess"" to your film.

It also has a bunch of other character actors who really blew up in the 90s. I rented it from Blockbuster back in the early 2000s and still think about it sometimes.&&He has that Leonardo DiCaprio sideways floaty beard thing &&""From the people who raised the money for....""&&""If you enjoyed how 'The King's Speech' came in under budget, then you'll LOVE ... ""&&Because it's rough to say ""Director of 88 Minutes and Righteous Kill""&&I mean... I understand your point but having a trusted producer involved is definitely not a bad indicator that the movie is going to be good.

Good producers can help fight for the artist's vision... they help foster positive work environments from the cast and crew...

That said.. I don't know too many producers by name.&&Have you not seen Justified? &&He was great in American Ultra. The movie itself sucked but he plays a great crazy person with a vulnerable side. He's a ""bad guy"" but you somehow sympathize with him when he tells the story of how he came to be. &&You mean Hateful Eight, right?&&He's gotta land a big-time, every award winning lead role at some point.  He is *such* a good actor.&&Came here to say this. And to warn this will not become a tickeling podcast&&Thanks for the link, couldn't find this on the podcast feed. Not sure why.&&I feel like he went from 45-50 looking to like 75 looking overnight.&&Getting close to 70, but he's still putting out great performances. If I had to choose now, he would be my pick for Best Actor this year. (Norman)&&He isn't a Pretty Woman anymore.&&Here is one interest, mister&&What would you give the film, on a scale of 1 to 10? Also, how accurate would you say it is? Do you feel that they took liberties with the script, or stayed fairly close to the book?
&&Thanks to you! :)&&I'm so glad I wasn't the only one who thought that.&&The fact that I had to scroll this far down to find this comment is an affront to The Lord Karl Marx&&I should have known whose comment this was.. You sir, are an ocean of references (and a river to your people).&&88 minutes is hilariously bad.&&Yeah not sure how this guy still gets work as a director. Maybe there's behind-the-scenes stuff that somehow caused his films to be shit at no fault of his, but at face value he's basically the guy who makes shitty movies with legendary actors.&&This whole post feels like a huge case of astroturfing.

And apart from OP s own comment no comment above 1 k upvotes.


I just dont legitimately see this much interest for this film in amyway.&&Bet it'll be interesting for you to compare notes when you watch this. Did you base the screenplay off of the book, or just the case?&&It's actually an adaption on the book ""The Three Christs of Ypsilanti"". It's a psychological case study in a mental institution where three (schizophrenic I believe) patients all believe they were actually Jesus Christ. 

The study has received a lot of criticism because of the lack of moral respect for the patients involved, mainly because the lead psychologist allowed dialogue and interaction to occur between these three patients in the name of psychological research. &&I would guess that it tells the true story of three patients in the same institution who each believed they were the second coming of Jesus Christ.&&He's also playing a schizophrenic here...&&Based on this still, I assume the one in GOT is heavily dyed so it looks less scrappy.&&Shane and his stupid wife ruined everything! &&Ip suh lan tea, locals call it Ypsi, (ip-sea) &&It's premiering tonight but we might not see a trailer/release for months.&&You forgot Sept 11th.&&Only if you go to Toronto Film Fest. :/&&You always start with the tip, and then you give it your all.&&I was taking a psychology class in college 20+ years ago.  The professor made a comment and described the book.  My first thought was ""that would make a great movie"". - not sure what took so long&&And the book ain't just dry reading either, if you think you're the least bit interested in reading it, give it a shot. It's rather compelling, and of course, disturbing at times. Good fun!&&On a funny side note, there was a funny askreddit story about a redditor who worked at the intake ward at a psychiatric hospital. It is generally the policy to not put schizophrenics with similar delusions together least they work each other up. But unfortunately, this day they accidentally put two patients who both thought they were Jesus into the same room. Once they realized what the did, the nurses all ran in expecting those two to be in fisticuffs. Except they actually found the two became friends--they spoke to each other and ""realized"" that one of them was Jesus, and the other John the Baptist.&&Interesting book! You just made some shop on Amazon 15£! 😉 &&I am thoroughly expecting riots in the streets if the public's reaction to this film is anything like its reaction to Kevin Smith's Dogma. &&It's a great book, too &&I read that book a *long* time ago. If it's anything like the book, this will be a very odd movie.&&I’ve this book wish-listed on Amazon for years. I should probably buy it, or just get it from a library. &&I remember reading the book during grad school in the 1980s. Fascinating, but not surprising occurrence, given how often this kind of delusion presents itself. At the time the book was written, there was not access to more effective antipsychotic medication. Today we do not have state hospitals where patients spend long periods of time with delusions that also last. At best, a Jesus might bump into another briefly, but three living in the same facility? I can't wait to see the movie.&&Want! Wow.&&Same, I have the book but only started a handful of pages into many years back.&&I suppose you work at the hospital and live there as well.&&As a resident of Ypsi, I can only imagine how the city's name is going to be butchered by non-Michiganders. &&Me too!!!&&Same! &&Wow, at least Rokeach learned something. What an asshole. Sorta reminds me of the Stanford experiment.&&That's because Finland isn't a real place&&The name is Greek, in fact.

&&I don't know if it was intentional, but your remark  corresponds nicely with the comment added to the revision of the book (it's in the wiki article - spoiler, though)&&Had to google it, it's Ramsay's girlfriend for others who also don't know.&&She's the kind of pretty that makes a guy forget how to breathe for a sec.&&Did anyone there (other than yourself) believe they were Jesus Christ? &&Three of them think they are Jesus.

&&He's fun in Sons of Anarchy too.&&His performance in the final season of *The Shield* is one of the best performances I have ever seen.  

Still my all-time favorite show.&&That's one I keep forgetting to binge! Thank you for reminding me.&&Dah dah dah dah dah dah daaahhh!!!&&Holla&&I think the shield is one of the best shows all time but no one every seems to watch it because of the wire. BTW I hated sons of anarchy partly because it took the shields time slot the next year and it sucked.&&Also in the hateful eight and Django! His southern rednceck character always  a joy to watch!&&Lmao he is amazing in that. I love McBride as well, but Goggins makes that show 10x better. I love his sassy, southern and possibly gay character.&&One more week until season 2! People don't seem to realize I'm referencing that show when I say ""fuck yourself off"". To be fair, it's a pretty vague reference, but it always cracks me up when I think of that scene.&&I don't know how I hadn't heard of, or noticed, Vice Principals until last week. Binged it all in an afternoon and then watched it all again a few days later. He's fucking phenomenal in it. Loved him in The Hateful Eight, he was probably my favorite character in the cast. &&Thanks, here's your sperm&&He broke my teeth!&&The story of Chiklis getting cast in The Shield is amazing. The producers thought of him as a chubby sitcom dad because of the Commish and didn't want him anywhere near The Shield, they thought they were interviewing him just as a favour to the showrunner. Then Chiklis shows up after shaving his head and working out for months, built like a fucking rhino with twice the intensity. The casting director didn't even recognise him at first. &&He was hot as Venus. I did a double take when he first showed up, like ""wait...is that...holy shit, it is!""&&Seeing as Justifieds best season was it's last, I have no idea what you're talking about.&&He's gotten old at precisely the same rate since he was born, if I'm not mistaken.&&he is 68 so.... you know....&&He just hasn't been as visible in AAA films in a while, and he's like 68.&&That has to be make-up, unless he's started throwing force lightning or some shit.&&His middle name is Tiffany???&&""You're not on trial for being a dwarf.""

Tyrion: ""Yes, I am. I've been on trial for that all my life.""&&> Owning your disability and strengthening the parts of you that do work is a great life lesson.

""Never forget what you are. Wear it like armour and it can never be used to hurt you.""&&He's brilliant in [The Station Agent](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340377/) if you haven't seen it I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Dinklage.&&""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""&&Watch The Station Agent. Great movie &&I barely think about his height when I watch GoT. Not that I don't notice, it's just not his most defining character (which is why he agreed to take the role). My brain isn't incessantly going ""ooh ,there's that tiny man"" like it would watching Mini Me or oompa loompas.&&>it's a show about dragons

I can see how you'd make that mistake, but it isn't. On a greater scale, it's about war and indiscriminate death. On a lesser scale, it's about characters who grow through adversity. In the end, it will be about battling gods.&&He was great in X-Men too, not enough screen time but stole the scenes he was in.&&It was never mentioned in XMen and that turned out fine.&&It reduces a person to one characteristic

Have you ever known a little person? It basically never comes up in real life, hardly the most interesting thing they have going on.&&And I'm sure he loves when fans point it out but make a point about how they ""didn't even notice"". If you didn't notice, why is it something you feel the need to say?&&I just watched rememory.  His character had nothing to do with his physical appearance and it wasn't mentioned.  Worked fine.&&I remember in an interview he said he almost turned down the role in GoT because he didn't know the books at the time, only heard it was a fantasy and, understandably, assumed he was playing a character who was of a dwarven race. It was only after he was explained that it was an actual genetic dwarf and what his character was like that he accepted.&&Yeah, there's one reason to use the producer instead haha. Another example would be all these shitty horror movies that cycle no name directors with one film or a couple of YouTube videos under their belt.&&""Director of Fried Green Tomatoes"" might be appealing to somebody (though not me, that movie blows). &&Boyd Crowder is one of the greatest TV characters EVER! &&Seriously... out of everything he's done, Justified is his best.&&I haven't yet! It was airing when I had too many things to watch, and currently I have one specific show that I will not mention from fear of spoilers. I plan on watching it soon though. &&I think I read somewhere that Boyd was only supposed to be in one episode but Goggins was so great, they made the series around him.

""it was Walton Goggins’ portrayal of the Kentucky crime lord that compelled Yost to keep Goggins around beyond the pilot and straight through to the show’s very last scene.'

Edit: Found source&&Nope, I mean Django. He was amazing in Hateful Eight, very true. But he was able to make such a small character in Django seem so much more important, and he played it out really well for the short time he had. &&*""All hail Queen Shit of Liesville""*&&The same age as Samuel L. Jackson, but he still looks like he is at most 50&&Like I said, I enjoyed the film. Gere's performance was quite smart and helped push his patients recovery to the forefront in an era when mental health treatment was torturous at best.

The Three Christs (Dinklage, Goggins, and Whitford) all struggle with their own history and while we learn challenging things about them, there is humour and personality that disconnects us from being over burdened.

I really liked Charlotte Hope's character (Becky Anderson) and her identity struggle, but I felt that a scene or two of hers may have dragged us away from the core of the plot. But that's just nit picking.

Aside from some minor visual problems and only one scene I felt was over the top from Gere, I quite enjoyed the mix of drama and the way it showed the viewer that it's ok to find comedy in sadness.  

A story worth telling and a movie worth watching should its subject interest you in the slightest. &&I haven't read the script or the book. Not that I'm not an avid reader or an obsessive film fan, but I do attend TIFF every year. I was given the ticket through a contact and Three Christs wasn't previously on my radar, which in retrospect it should have been. I would probably be interested in reading the book now though, the subject matter is powerful. 

I'd give it a 7.5 but I hate reviews. I'd rather watch something and distill it myself than read a review and decide whether or not to invest my time in it based on someone else's lens. Take a risk and see it :)&&Bullshtye, all I did was wrangle Goggins a couple times :)&&So many shitty directors continue to make shitty movies. It's almost more surprising when a good movies gets made.&&Just the case. &&I understood that, I just thought it sounded kinda funny&&So will it be available to the public tonight or how is this whole shebang gonna be? &&September 10th: First image.

September 11th: ???

September 12th: Prophet.&&#NeverForget&&It's gotten too expensive for the average local enthusiast unfortunately :\&&Yeah, I heard of the book way back in high school and it sounded really interesting. We talked about it a bit in depth, but I never got the chance to pick it up and read it. Certainly sounds like it will make for a fascinating film. &&I don't see any references to The Ruling Class - 1972. Starring Peter O'Toole as a schizophrenic in a mental institution who thinks he's Jesus Christ and gets confronted with two others who have the same belief. Classic Camp comedy. Highly recommended.&&culture has to be in the right spot for it to do well/attract big enough names to it. 20 years ago there were probably 60% less atheist/agnostics then there are now. It would have been considered blasphemy to even watch it to some communities. Much like ""god is dead"" and ""harry potter"" even the one about the crucifixion. &&Hah, like two kids playing.&&Why would it react like that? They're *completely* different stories. This is based on a true story of a psychiatric case study of three guys whose delusions made them think they were Jesus. Dogma was an obscene fantasy comedy movie that ripped into the Catholic church and was pretty blasphemous. I'm not saying that as a criticism of Dogma, it's one of my favorite movies of all time, but I understand why the Catholic League was offended by it.&&What was the reaction to Dogma?&&I think the treatment here is rather different. I can't imagine anything more than token outrage from the easily outraged.&&So a handful of people were minorly irritated and protested it, but stopped no screenings and the film went on to be enjoyed as a cult film for years to come? &&I don't see any reason to expect that. This is based off an actual psychological experiment of sorts. It's entirely different than Dogma. I actually first heard of the experiment from a Catholic Deacon. There's many other movies out there that would be considered substantially more irreverent. &&""Riots in the streets""

JFC the hyperbole in here. &&In a row?&&People will pronounce it like ""yip"" in ""yippee!!""&&And me!&&[deleted]&&Still googled it even with this comment, don't know what I expected.&&Last interview I saw of him he was bald and wrinkly, I’m ultra confused by this transformation. &&He was younger then.&&Venus is easily my favorite non-Son character. &&That character might have been the highlight of the show.&&The last few seasons were so bad that I was just hoping he'd show up to make it at least entertaining.&&He was brilliant on Sons of Anarchy, but it is so painful to watch him on Vice Principals. He basically just rehashes the Venus persona. I hope he brings something new to the table here. I am really looking forward to this.&&>Still my all-time favorite show.

Mine too. It seems to occupy a weird spot on the TV pantheon where everyone is aware of it but no one ever actually watches it.

Which is truly a shame, because the show is fantastic. That series finale is an absolute masterpiece. &&""Family Meeting!""

Still gives me chills....&&I love that show. I think it's the best cop show ever made. Vic Mackey is one of the greatest TV characters ever. He's up there with Walter White and Tony Soprano. So, here it is: The Shield is better than The Wire. Yeah, I said it. And it felt really good.&&More people need to watch *The Shield*, it's truly amazing. 

It has a few glaring flaws, but if you can see your way past those, you're in for an outstanding experience. 

The flaws:  Some of the supporting characters are awful (Julien)

The entire show is trying just a *little* too hard to be EXTREME, especially in Season One.


The theme song is insufferable, especially when binging. 

Other than that, it's one of the best written and acted (exception: Julien) shows ever (especially: Michael Chiklis, Walton Goggins, Glenn Close, Forrest Whitaker, Anthony Anderson) and it deserves to be included in conversations with *The Wire*, and *Breaking Bad*, and *The Sopranos* as one of the best shows of all-time&&[deleted]&&>BTW I hated sons of anarchy partly because it took the shields time slot the next year and it sucked.

I'm literally watching Sons as I type this comment.

I basically feel like it is a worse version of The Shield. Tons of shared cast and producers, but it just falls short in every metric. &&It feels like The Shield was more popular when they were on the air but The Wire has definitely eclipsed it in legacy.

Two very different kinds of cop shows, but both awesome in their own way.&&It is because he's from Georgia and knows how to portray such characters accurately without being a stereotype. Source: From Georgia, met Goggins at the 70mm Atlanta showing of Hateful 8. Very nice guy.

Edit: *how&&End of the Line, slut!&&""I bet when she gets up here, she smells like fucked buttholes""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNyrScZVWWg&&Don't you tussle with the Russell.&&Thanks for the heads up on the new season! Recently watched it through a few times and didn't realize season two was so close. Both Walton Goggins and Danny Mcbride are perfect. What a duo.   The entire cast is great though. &&""She smells like fucked buttholes.""
""I believe the kids refer to that as 'truffle butter'.""&&Also, sperm. &&Agreed, nothing about Justified ever got tired. It was solid from start to end.&&Hm. Interesting.&&Dinklage acted the shit out of that scene.&&I wish I was the monster you all think I am&&I also love the scene in the next episode I believe. When Oberyn goes to speak to Tyrion in his cell. 

Both of their acting there is pretty great too! &&Which season is that? The one where he was accused of killing Joffrey?&&

Why doesn't that director make more movies?&&[deleted]&&Good point but to nit-pick it actually raised some questions for me about the extent of Mystique's powers. She imitates Trask, who obviously has a much smaller stature than her own. So she can not only change her outward appearance, but also change the amount of space she takes up? Of course, replicating any other individual is going to result in a small change of size, at least, but is there anything to stop her from imitating a baby? Or conversely a giant man (or a tree)?&&I really loved Goggins/Crowder and Olyphant/Raylan that entire series. Their final scene together to close out the series was so poignant. [""We dug coal together"" is such a perfect ending.](https://youtu.be/AoPvmBoOwXE). Breaking Bad is the preeminent character study in character evolution through decisions and circumstances. Justified brilliantly shows you how two men from identical circumstances can wind up on opposite ends of the spectrum from just a few key decisions (and a little luck).

LOVED me some Goggins ever since. Will see anything he does. 

Throw in Tyrian Lannister and it's a must watch!

Edit: gold?! Thank you kind strangers!&&Justified should have been first on that list&&Yeah, it's weird to leave it off.&&I haven't seen *Justified* yet, but I am skeptical of anyone doing anything to outdo his work on *The Shield*&&I got the Justified box set for Christmas, and it's easily gone into my Top 5 shows of all time.

The Shield showed what could exist on basic cable before basic cable was known for producing much of anything but reruns and shows on specialty networks.  A basic cable show getting nominated and winning Emmys and Golden Globes was unheard of at the turn of the century, but The Shield broke through in 2002 and changed the landscape entirely.

I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. &&I just rewatched, and yeah, that was a great scene as well. Especially when they talked of Tyrion's birth&&From Roger Ebert's Review:
> ""The Station Agent"" makes it clear that too many people make it all the way to adulthood without manners enough to look at a little person without making a comment. It isn't necessarily a rude comment -- it's that any comment at all is rude. In a way, the whole movie builds up to a scene in a bar. A scene that makes it clear why Finbar does not enjoy going to bars. The bar contains a fair number of people so witless and cruel that they must point and laugh, as if Finbar has somehow chosen his height in order to invite their moronic behavior. Finally he climbs up on a table and shouts, ""Here I am! Take a look!"" And that is the moment you realize there is no good reason why Peter Dinklage could not play Braveheart.   

[Full Review](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-station-agent-2003
)&&His last film was Spotlight, which won Best Picture in 2015, as well as earned Tom McCarthy (the writer/director) an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He was a writer on Pixar's Up, and directed episodes of 13 Reasons Why. He's acted in things like Good Night, and Good Luck and The Wire. He's also a writer on the upcoming Christopher Robin movie. Not like the guy doesn't work very often, he just does a lot of different things.&&Then youtube clips of him in underdog and pixels and pretty much any easy paycheck he's made cuz he's always doing his best with whatever he's given. &&One of the generals  does make a snide remark in one of the meetings. I thought it was cleverly used to highlight of the xenophobic nature of the world. It acknowledged his dwarfism but didn't make Peter the butt of the joke, even though his character was being mocked in that scene.&&She can change density but not mass. Think heavy Trask, very light Groot.&&In xmen first class you see her as a little kid impersonate an adult woman.

It is essentially the same thing in reverse, he got a lot bigger then&&You need to see Justified then&&Just watch the pilot and it should be more than enough to convince you of how incredible Goggins is in Justified. His character only develops from there and it is fantastic. &&It was funny cause my wife and I were watching Olyphant in Deadwood and then heard about Justified and had to see it. Boyd Crowder was definitely my favorite though.&&Loretta is my fave.

* Edit: at the protest.&&The reporter wasn't oblivious. They knew who he was but played along with his refusal to admit it. Smith goes into this in one of his Evening with specials. &&I would hardly call it ""massive protests outside of most screenings"", there was a handful of Protests outside of a few screenings that quickly petered out. 

Most screenings had no protests. &&The Catholic Church did not condemn the film.

It was condemned by the Catholic League which is a private, conservative, activist group.

And massive? About 100 protesters showed up to the premiere. A few other locations had protesters on the opening night at other locations but as Smith said in the video you linked, it wasn't very many people (he said about 15 at the one he went to) and they weren't really seen again after opening night.

Not really what I would call massive.

And what do you mean ""oblivious reporter""? The newcast even said ""looks suspiciously like Kevin Smith ... but wouldn't admit it."" They knew darn well who it was.&&Dogma is one of my favs! 
&&It was strange because Kevin is Catholic and still goes to mass.&&Grarr damn those movies I don't want to see.&&This is *completely* different to the 'Gone With The Wind' thing.&&Wow. Hit that nail on the head. Good description. &&Hey Father Ted out in the wild.&&Like Billy Bob Thornton playing Michael Douglas.&&I like Alvarez. I'm just starting season 7, I hope he makes it through. &&I'm not going to make fun of you for liking it, I respect your opinion, but damn was it hard for me to get through seasons 5-7. I always felt like it was a five season show bloated to seven. Season four was the best season I thought, and it seemed like things were really building to a climactic season five, and then everything just starts treading water and the shock value deaths felt hollow for me. I thought the Tara kill was just mean-spirited and out of left field for no damn reason. It was like Sutter saw all the big reactions Game of Thrones was getting for character deaths and wanted in on that game, except he didn't understand all the nuance and subtle foreshadowing Game of Thrones put into all of those events transpiring.&&Talking about his kids...... and that snaps that cell phone shut. God. Damn.&&It also made the ""major guest star hangs out for an entire season"" a thing. Forest Whitaker's season long melt down was a thing of beauty. &&Sounds about right. That guy always creeped me out. &&They're totally different shows. The Shield was fast, high-octane, total adrenaline.

The Wire is its exact opposite. It's slow, deliberate, methodical. It focuses intensely on the details. Stories from The Shield would *never* work in The Wire's universe, but suspending that disbelief is part of the fun.&&I am also not a professional. When it comes to anything.&&I'm glad for those scenes where one actor can really let loose in an ensemble show where no one really gets the lion's share of screen time. Davos had one of those scenes back in season 6 and [it was excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKp8_hC6gvI). Spoilers, obviously.&&I was sad how unimportant Tyrion's character had become in the new season, until the last episode. Man, what a performance.&&""I've always been your son...""&&Huh?&&For me it might have been the most emotional scene, on par with the Red Wedding. He's this wisecracking lovable guy througout the first three seasons and starts out by giving advice to Jon Snow about not letting your lower status get to you and wearing it as a shield. Seeing him break down completely and breaking that shield hit really hard, and having one of the funniest actors up until that part knock it out of the park in a dramatic scene made it such a phenomenal moment.&&Any chance you can find a link? I have no interest in the show at large, but I wouldn't mind seeing this specific scene.&&He's actually 7'2"".

 He's just a phenomenal actor.&&It kind of flies under the radar for a lot of people. But does a great job showing just how much Cersei hates Tyrion. &&Fun fact: McCarthy also directed the unrealeased pilot episode of Game of Thrones (the absolutely disastrous one that made them recast half the actors and reshoot a bunch of stuff)&&so we add a never_forget_distaste_bot that always replies 'too soon' to the never_forget_bot&&I'm guessing it came from Tumblr&&***BIZARRE***&&Two demons (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) discover a loophole that will allow themselves to return to heaven. An angel (Allen Rickman) sends a woman (the girl from Men in Black, sorry, can't remember her name) to stop them.  

The movie pokes fun at the issues with religious dogma (hence the name), but it isn't anti-religion (Kevin Smith is catholic). It's a fun movie; definitely one of Smith's best.    

I'd check out his other films first: Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy. They're not really needed to enjoy dogma, but it introduces you to Kevin's ""voice"" as well as the characters of Jay and Silent Bob, which feature prominently in Dogma. &&Even if you're not a fan of other Kevin Smith flicks, Dogma is a good one to check out. It's a comedy with religious themes but nothing downright insulting, the protests were from people who made a lot of assumptions (and the protests were very short lived and small so idk what he means by riots in the streets). It also includes Jay and Silent Bob, two Kevin Smith character icons &&Religious Dogma. &&A fallen angel tries to undo the Universe by taking advantage of a loophole in Catholic Dogma, the last relative descendant of Christ, Jay and Silent Bob, a Muse, and the 13th Apostle are sent to stop the plan and save existence.  

If you want to see his films, Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, are all considered essential. 

Clerks II, Mallrats, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike back are all really funny and enjoyable to me. 

His films that are mostly unconnected to his Jersey films are more divisive but still have fans. &&two fallen angels (a watcher named loki, and his friend, the original angel of death bartleby.) are told by god that they are forbidden to come back to heaven after insulting god a long time ago, back during the old testament days, back when god was kind of a dick.

they discover a loophole in catholic dogma (plenary indulgence) that allows them back into heaven, directly contradicting gods law, since god is infallible (according to Catholicism) that would create a paradox unmaking reality.

a distant relative to jesus christ in today's time is tapped by the Metatron (the voice of god) and tasked with stopping them.&&It's about 2 fallen angels (Played by Ben Afleck and Matt Damon), cast out of Heaven by God, who find a loophole through the bible that will allow them to get back into heaven.

A good angel finds Jesus' ancestor and convinces her to help stop them. 

It's a little cheesy at times, but it's one of my favorites. Though it's not the first Kevin Smith movie I'd recommend. It would help to be familiar with Jay & Silent Bob first, through Clerks, Mallrats & Chasing Amy. They make a lot of references in Dogma.&&Two fallen angels get cast out of heaven by God, and try to leverage a loophole to get back in. Our heroes are recurring characters from the cinematic universe, and their goal is to stop them because the loophole will end the world.&&Sorry, by screenings I meant early screenings. Not every showing had a protest. &&Thank you. Let's not blow this out of proportion. &&What's conversational hyperbole anyway&&Probably my favorite film by him.&&""Sling blade, for lack of a better word, is good...""&&I heard they were working on a Mayan spinoff. It could have been dropped, or we'll get it years from now for all I know.  &&I can see why someone would feel that way. I think that I was just so attached to the characters, more so than any other show I'd ever seen, and I was completely invested in the outcome for everyone. The characters I hated in that show, I hated more than any characters of any other show I've ever hated. The ones I loved, I felt the same way. I binged it - I didn't watch it as it was on TV - so maybe that led to me feeling this way. But I truly felt they were all family to me and it made me very emotional, even when it was very similar to a soap opera with the drama.&&And now I'm rewatching the entire series for the thousandth time.&&Me too.  &&Some of my favorite scenes from the first seasons are Littlefinger and Varys talking to each other, those two had such great chemistry it was electric.&&I think some of the best acting I've ever seen was his hate filled outburst during his murder trial.&&Of all the characters in GoT (and it's not like we're short on choice), Liam Cunningham is far and away the most convincing in and suited to his role. When he's on screen, there isn't a moment where I'm not completely convinced that he *is* Davos Seaworth. 

Every other actor has instances (or their character has lines) that will momentarily drop my absorption with the scene, interrupt my suspension of disbelief, and remind me that I'm watching a show with actors trading lines -- particularly those actors using non-native accents (and this is where Dinklage suffers, IMO).

Cunningham has no such moments. He's really superb in his role.

&&God damn what a performance.&&Davos's actor plays the role so perfectly. The man is the epitome of roguish charm. He's easily my favorite character to see on-screen at any given moment.&&I thought of that scene before I clicked the link. That was a really memorable one (as was the crime discussed there, that was horrible). &&HALF MAN! HALF MAN! HALF MAN! I loved when he united the Hill Tribes and fought with them, and saving the battle of Blackwater was cool too.

He is not doing very well as Daenerys's hand of the queen, as she lost quite a bit in season 7, and has now been led to think there is no threat to the south by Tyrion enabling Cersei's betrayal of trust.&&The contrast between those scenes is great too. Tyrion has his angry rant in the first one, but he is really cold in the second one. I also loved the way Tywin kept speaking to Tyrion as if he were reprimanding a child, during the court scene but also in the privy scene. Another gem from that scene:

Tyrion: ""I loved her"" (said with a lot of emotion)

Tywin: ""Who?"" (in a tone as if it doesn't matter)&&""He's a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.""&&it's a joke lol&&[Here's](https://youtu.be/e4Uq8O5ZhUA) the link to his actual monologue. The other scene linked was just the build-up.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C_1RD4LqRs&&Yeah, she seems to hate pretty much everyone else too, but she has a special place for her hatred of Tyrion.

I've seen all I need to see here, I'm in.  &&[Here is the behind the scenes of 'Annihilation'](https://thefilmstage.com/news/go-behind-the-scenes-of-alex-garlands-stalker-inspired-sci-fi-drama-annihilation/).

Some of the behind the scenes images are also gorgeous. I haven't read the book but I am excited for this and this trailer fueled my expectations.&&**S**ecure  
**C**ontain  
**P**rotect&&I was gonna say there was a distinct lack of ""BWWAAAAHHHH"" in this trailer, but they made up for it at the end.&&I really hate this trend of 5 seconds of trailer before the trailer. I understand why they do it (because of YouTube skips) but it just feel so out of place&&This looks great! It's not quite what I imagined when I read the book, but I can't wait to see what Garland does with it.&&Aliens: ""Damn Natalie you a crazy chick""

Natalie: ""Yo shut the fuck up and suck my dick!""&&Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dimlit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been. In the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation of the fatal softness in the earth. The shadows of the abyss are like the petals of a monstrous flower that shall blossom within the skull and expand the mind beyond what any man can bear, but whether it decays under the earth or above on green fields, or out to sea or in the very air, all shall come to revelation, and to revel, in the knowledge of the strangling fruit—and the hand of the sinner shall rejoice, for there is no sin in shadow or in light that the seeds of the dead cannot forgive. And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing. And then there shall be a fire that knows the naming of you, and in the presence of the strangling fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you that remains.&&Looks like Garland has fused Stalker with Solaris.&&I've not read the book, but I was getting a darker version on Contact from the trailer. Which is a good thing. 

It's a shame they've called this a 'teaser' trailer, as they will no doubt give away more of the plot when the next one is released - which they don't need to. &&Should I read this or wait for the movie? I feel like there is never an easy choice.&&Hope this does well at the box-office. Every day people on this sub complain about there not being enough original movies. Respect to the regime at Paramount that decided to give us mother!, Downsizing, and now Annihilation.

Looking forward to it. It's a very unsettling book.&&Man, if this turns out to be one of those ""awesome trailer / shitty movie"" things, I'm gonna be extra disappointed. This reminds me of *Arrival,* so I hope it's the beginning of a resurgence in real sci fi movies!&&For anyone asking about reading the books, **Yes, please read the books**

Read everything Jeff Vandermeer has written. His Ambergris novels have stuck with me in the way that most novels don't. His latest, Borne, is an amazing book about parenthood that features a shapeshiting bio-engineered organism and a *Godzilla sized psychotic flying bear*.

Also, read the anthologies he and his wife have put out together.

I have been a huge fan for a long time. I hope this movie elevates his popularity, because he deserves it.&&The book is amazing and Alex Garland is the most perfect pick to help translate it to film. This looks utterly gorgeous. &&Reminds me of The Color Out of Space by HP Lovecraft a bit.&&Portman looks like an absolute badass with that rifle.&&* Not telling me half the story in the trailer

It's great!!!&&Looks like Arrival x Alien: Covenant&&I honestly can't think of a way I'd be more excited for this movie after seeing the trailer. The feel and look are basically exactly what I'd hope for, and I'm only more interested to see how Garland is able to create some of the surreal visuals from the book.&&Anyone else think this is reminiscent of Tarkovsky's film 'Stalker' (based on the book 'Roadside Picnic' by Arkady & Boris Strugatsky)?&&u/mburaad &&All I know is Ex Machina was one of the best movies made in the past 10 years. So yea, I'm in. &&Get out of here STALKER.&&From the director of Ex Machina. Shut up and take my money!﻿

Something to occupy me during the wait.&&Twice it says, 'from the writer/director of Ex Machina' not sure why its mentioned again &&Is this going to be one of those movies that people are super pissed about because it's not what they think it's gonna be?

I'm disappointed &&I hope it opens with the rabbits from the second book.&&What the hell is up with the flashes to sex scenes?

The fuck does that have to do with anything?  Is sex really going to sell this movie instead of the actual premise?&&This has the potential to be one of those ""better than the book"" movies. 

Because the books are sort of aimless. I liked them, but they were all over the place. And I get it, I get why, I just went from loving the first one to ""eh?"" on the third one. &&Ok. I’ve searched almost throughout the whole thread and in fear of spoiling myself I must ask : name of the book ? Author ? Thanks &&Looks amazing. Any word on rating? The book had a couple of hard R-rated scenes.&&Ive got my popcorn ready and waiting lol.   Why do they make these trailers soooooo far away from movie releases lol.   I want to see it now lol. &&[deleted]&&I'm surprised this got made to be honest, I kind of assumed it was something that would get stuck in development hell and get cancelled. I read the first book when it came out and wasn't all that impressed so I never bothered with the sequels (for those that don't know it's the first of a trilogy).

Maybe the next two books are better (and I can only assume they'll try to do a movie franchise too), but unless it really improves on the book I doubt I'll be interested. I LOVED Ex Machina, so I'm hoping Alex Garland pulls through on this one but he might be dragged down by the source material here.&&*No.*

Sigh, proving what we feared.&&Also I've been starving for real science fiction that doesn't involve comic book franchises. &&It's treason, then.&&I was completely confused and loved every second of it!&&That's how I felt after reading that book. lol. VanDermeer does a great job at building a deep mystery that is filled with more layers than pages. I highly recommend the book.&&She's in this? Awesome! I love her on Jane. &&She looks so funny with a gun in her hands in this trailer, I am so used to picturing her in Jane the Virgin! I am so excited to see her performance in this film though. I bet she'll be amazing&&The cast looks fantastic (Gina Rodriguez! Tessa Thompson! Benedict Wong! Oscar Issac!), but everything I've experienced from Alex Garland felt like unfinshed Twilight Zone episodes. His stories don't end so much as just -- stop. I can already see that the final shot of this movie is going to be someone staring at the camera before a hard cut to credits...&&It's got a great director, amazing source material, the casting is spot on, and the visuals look fantastic. My hopes are pretty high for this one!&&Also if anyone is interested in this type of literature by other authors, r/weirdlit is a great subreddit for recommendations. I've found so much good shit from that sub. &&I love the Ambergris novels and novellas. What an awesome world. Really loved the change in tone between Shriek and Finch.&&Borne is fucking awesome. Honestly, I would watch the shit put of a Borne movie too: the whole thing would look like the world's on acid.&&The books are very Lovecraftian in parts, so the comparison is fitting.&&If I'm not going to get a Mountains of Madness movie any time soon, this will do just fine in the meantime.  The colors are amazing!&&Listened to that on audio the other night, it's amazing how truly unnerving that story is. I'd recommend people check it out on Spotify, which has many of Lovecraft's works.&&Looks like proper recoil too&&That's what I call aggressive negotiations. &&I saw her at Tiff last year and let me tell you, she is small but extremely intimidating.  &&Watchu want Natalie?!&&It's so if the trailer is played as a youtube ad even if it's is skipped after five seconds there will still be like a mini-trailer.&&I think the studios are hip to the 40% rule of skipping ahead and are trying to ""correct"" the behavior.&&I'm just disappointed the date got moved to February. We might get nuked before I get to see it. &&The setting has a slight Roadside Picnic feel to it, but it very, very different.&&Oh yeaaa!!&&Same here. I was like, please don't fuck up a great book... Oh Garland is doing it? Sign me up. &&Important to the story actually lol&&Here it is https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation&&It was supposed to come out this fall but they pushed back the release date :(&&• Blade Runner 2036: Nexus Dawn (short)

• Upcoming Philip. K. Dick's Electric Dreams episode&&Street Countdown episode of the I.T Crowd&&Not sci-fi and not a movie and not all that recent but he was a pretty good Kublai Khan in Marco Polo too&&Don't forget Alex Yu in Prey.

*edit kublai not ghengis &&I love Sunshine, such great sci-fi. Loved his character in it.&&> Sunshine 

<3&&He had emmy worthy performances throughout Marco Polo. He was the one good thing about that show.&&Wait... there was a Benedict Wong and a Benedict Cumberbatch in Dr. Strange? I feel like thats such and uncommon name for that to happen&&He will always be Errol from ‘15 Storeys High’ to me. &&He will allows be Errol from ‘15 Storeys High’ to me. &&>This guy is a sci-fi magnet that's for sure.

You spelled **typecast** wrong.&&He's [come a long way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO5Ca_qBSXE).&&This is what I'll always know him as.&&That's Wong on so many levels

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kindly stranger&&I never get tired of seeing him and Chiwetel Ejiofor. And Jeffrey Wright.&&Hundred Eyes and most of the female cast were great.  Should have just called it Kublai.&&I agree with you. Outside of him, it was an OK show at best. He was phenomenal though.&&""Come wipe your hands on my coat""&&Loved 15 Stories High. Thought it was really funny when he turned up as a cameo in 'Moon' (one of the company guys). Now he's everywhere!&&Benedict Wong Game of Thrones season 8 confirmed.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Somebody captured all those deer and glued plastic flowers to their antlers.&&Is this the VanderMeer book?&&Super happy they kept the Floridan landscape. Was kinda worried they would make it generic jungle &&Even more so. The book was incredibly subtle with what was going on. This looks like full blown in your face craziness.

I love them both.

EDIT: Actually, the more I think about it, these movie visuals are way too overt for what's going on in the story. But hey, it's a movie and you have to show instead of telling.&&That's both a good and bad for me. I feel like I need to read the book again, because holy hell was it weird. 

I enjoyed it, but I honestly can't say that I remember that much about it. &&Should I read it? Let me preface by saying I read the short story for Arrival first, and it negatively impacted my reaction to the film.&&I just watched Ex Machina over the weeked, not knowing anything about it, on a whim recommended by amazon video and I was really really impressed, Fantastic movie! I'm excited for this one now as well. 

&&I just love Rob Hardy's work. &&Robert Elswit is not coming back for M:I 6? Shame, the cinematography for Rogue Nation was one of the best I've ever seen in an action film. Then again, very excited to see Hardy's work.&&Fuck funding Mission: Scientology Fundraiser, but I agree he's amazing.&&Have you read annihilation? There are a lot of thematic similarities between the two. Annihiation kind of feels like a cross between Stalker and Lovecraft. I cannot recommend the series enough.&&Same. And a little Solaris.&&It was released in late April, not February. Those first two months usually mean for a shit-show, but I have faith.&&Got to get it in before the generic summer blockbusters start warming up. I thought the same thing though.&&I think that makes better narrative sense tbh.&&I'll definitely check it out after I see the movie.  Sometimes reading the book first taints the movie going experience for me.  &&....I hated the book.  I didn't finish the trilogy.  Despite how I feel personally...the teaser looked interesting.&&I always avoid trailers once I have committed seeing a film and I successfully shield myself for *months* until I see another movie a month or two out from release and am forced to sit through the trailer in the theater anyway. So I don't know why I bother, really. &&That's the best way to watch movies&&I feel like Im the only one who wasnt amazed by this movie.&&agreed. it was my ""best movie of 2014"" and now i consider it a top 10 favorite of mine. so good&&Yes.&&I loved it. Probably one of my favorite films. &&The Beach! &&I second this. Kafka meets Lovecraft, with a hefty dose of Roadside Picnic.&&Reading the book gave me a full on moment of panic, bout 3/4 of the way through, sitting in a darkened room and there was sound in the hallway, jumped all the way off the couch and shrieked. &&[Can someone explain to me how anyone could read the first book and not be frustrated/dissapointed? The ending of the first book anwered nothing. It reminded me of Lost, tons of weirdness never explained..](#spoiler)&&i actually bought the book after i saw the teaser and your comment about 15 minutes earlier. This kinda weird atmosphere just got me hooked instantly, really looking forward to the read.&&I'm torn. I always find (and hold out before you downvote!) that reading a book *after* the movie based on it is the more rewarding experience. A movie will always be less detailed, have parts cut out, etc. So when you read the book afterwards, you get additional content. When you read the book first, you'll always be disappointed about your favorite part not having made it into the screenplay.

But now I'm curious as hell, though!&&Downloading tonight. Im a sucker for Sci Fi novels
&&I might have to give it a shot after I finish IT.  Seriously, it's getting annoying that all of these cool movies are getting made out of books I haven't read yet.&&I disagree. I personally really enjoyed the second and loved the third. They expand and add onto an intriguing world, and if you like that world it's worth the read.&&It's like if the SCP never got past their first skip.&&Do an accelerating flicker/sound-cut effect to increase tension.&&>I remember when this was what trailers where like, not a TL/DR version of the movie. Long trailers put me the fuck off going to see movies in the cinema. 

Amen. 

&&This trailer is all I need to know I want to see this movie. Now I'm going to have to consciously be on the lookout for and avoid the inevitable full length 5 minute long trailer that will spoil all the major plot points as it spoon feds the audience.&&I think you are misunderstanding its purpose.  For us, whose object is the trailer itself, it will always be redundant.  It's for people whose object is something else, and what we watched is their ad that precedes their something.  &&Jennifer Jason Leigh is always amazing.  I don't know if she stopped working for a while, or if I just didn't happen to see her in anything.  But it's been great to see her again in Hateful Eight, Twin Peaks, and now this movie which looks great.&&Ah, I didn't know that detail. That's good to hear, especially since I'm with you about the sequels.&&I've read that too, but her sitting in the white room being interviewed feels straight from the second book to me.&&[deleted]&&It’s 100% lovecraft.&&""P IS FOR PORTMAN""&&Damn I forgot about that&&SNL allows their videos to be viewed in South Africa, then they geoblock them, then they allow it, then they block them. It is driving me crazy. &&I don't sleep motherfucker off that 'gnac and the durban
Doin 120 gettin head while I'm swervin'&&Lol yes it's a pretty prominent and reoccurring passage. The book is cray cray.&&Well, the novels this is based on are obviously inspired by Roadside Picnic, so that makes sense.&&Because the plot is too large?&&Dude I can't wait to read this book after yesterday and today's post comments.&&I read them too, and Vandermeer explains it at one point during the third book. Here's how I understood it:

[There was an alien machine or device that arrived in that location after their planet was destroyed. It was in the meteorite that the S&S brigade was studying, and was used to make the lighthouse mirror. The device's purpose was to rebuild the alien environment after a catastrophe by sampling the surroundings, copying and replicating/rebuilding them. On Earth, it is doing what it's supposed to do, but it's confused as to what it's sampling. It doesn't know what a cell phone is, so it replicates it as an animal. It sees an organism and recreates it without the full knowledge of how environment works. It's basically transforming with incongruous  information.](#spoiler)

There's more to it, but that's essentially what is going on.&&Oh good, it wasn't just me.  I thought I was just dense.  I'm going to give the series another read before the movie comes out though, to see if I can get anything else from it that I missed the first time. Love a good existential horror&&I was telling my friend ( a fellow avid reader) about it and as I stumbled through a description, she finally blurted out "" you don't even know what happens?!!?"" And I was like just read it, omg. &&I am more thinking whether I want the film ""spoiled"" or not.&&lol you think the book is going to explain anything.&&> fleshed out

Quite literally, in this case. :D Seriously though, don't expect the books to make more sense than the movie won't.&&When people complain about there not being enough original movies, they generally mean they're sick of reboots, sequels, prequels, remakes, etc.

A movie that's adapted from another medium is still a big improvement on those.&&So was the Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, Nosferatu, Apocalypse Now....

Adapt a unique book, get a unique movie&&They could easily trim down the gore to go PG-13, but R makes more sense.&&That's a fantastic show. My girlfriend made me watch it and now we're on a marathon of it and I love it&&Man, that last scene in Finch....

Did you catch the Grey Cap reference in Annihilation?&&Yeah that was what I noticed, had to replay because it looks real and cool&&Me likey&&What about his IT Crowd appearance? That's my favorite episode!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaBTKIFPKM4&&His Electric Dreams episode has already been on (in the UK at least). And he was fantastic in it.&&and the Infinity Wars movies..&&Pretty nice shorts indeed:

Why did I not know about this show? I'll have to check that out asap&&18 letters... I've never seen so many.

He is the One&&He has spirit, this one!&&That's how I'll always remember him&&Yes indeed. First time I ever saw him on screen. Still makes me chuckle to think of him shuffle. &&My name is Prime.&&My wife and I break out into spontaneous Street Countdown twirls at least once a week.&&You want Mongolia? You come and take it!&&He was like the only good actor on that show. 
  
Edit: I hereby amend my comment to state that Benedict Wong, Ng Chin Han, and Tom Wu are damn good in Marco Polo.  I will also accept that the because the writing was shit, none of the actors had much to work with.  The guy that played the titular character still sucked Mongol balls, though. &&He was outstanding in that role!  And he had to put on some weight to fill out that belly... only took a few moments to erase all thoughts of, “that’s the gun from Sunshine!” from my head and he became Khan.&&Wasn't that the dude Brian Boitano beat up?&&he was by far the best part of that show&&oooooh shit that's right&&I mean it ended in 2016. It's pretty recent &&Oh yeah he was great in Prey.&&I’m so glad they used an Asian for the Asian protagonist in a major game. 

Props to Prey’s developer.&&Yeah good character&&That was the first time I saw him. He's an excellent actor&&easily the shows best actor &&He pretty much carried the show by himself.&&So that's why I recognized the voice. Sci-fi really fits him.&&He will always be Kublai to me. His best role. I wish that show wasn't cancelled. :(&&He's kublai khan... Genghis Khan's grandson.  That might be way you were down voted. &&So I dunno if you'd be interested at all in this, but my best friend and I put together an unofficial space-themed trilogy we call ""sun, moon, and stars"". It consists of Sunshine first, Moon second, and Interstellar last. We even came up with a prequel trilogy of sorts with a similar theme but it's not as good. We didn't name it, but it consists of Solaris, Event Horizon, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

We had sat down for the day watching movies inside on a very rainy day and watched those 3 movies and thought ""hey those flow really good together"".&&2/3

Edit: I'm joking.&&The scenery, props, period clothing, weapons were all phenomenal in my opinion.&&Good Morning, that's a nice Tnetennba &&If Wong playing Wong is wong, then I don't wanna be wight.&&https://i.imgur.com/vdt3cgs.gifv&&That one line, ""People used to think that I was funny"", ""Did they work for you?""

The utterly deadpan delivery turns it into a most epic burn.&&I honestly think people didn't like Marco Polo (the character in the show) because he felt shoe horned in as a white guy for the main character. Like the show is based on a mongolian empire and the main character is a white guy, because of course that's the only way people will watch, it felt insulting.

But from a narrative perspective him as an ensnarled foreigner to this weird inclusive place makes sense as a plot device, but the show could've probably taken the risk of using someone else as a main character, possibly Kublai, or even better Kublai's son.I feel like after Kublai beats his cousin and the south china character the set up of the half indian(?) guy as a villain was pretty weak, but I'm not sure making Kublai the main character is good, he's very grey in a lot of ways, he's almost like a Jabba the Hutt type character. He serves as a strong antivillain or ""boss"" roll.&&""You stink! Go and have a shower""

""I've had one""

""Well have a bath""

""Well have another one""

""I've had another one. I've had three showers and two baths""

""With soap?""&&Mushrooms, in this case.&&Like he said, regular Florida.&&Bath salts?&&I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that was a real Florida Man story. &&I had no idea so many people read it. I thought it was good but really liked the 2nd one.  Saving the 3rd for a bit later. &&Yes&&florida is the most strange and dangerous jungle of all&&Yeah, I think I can get on board with it just because it's a different medium. I was expecting something more like *Stalker* where the uncanniness is more understated. But, the thing is, the characters in *Stalker* don't encounter anything as blatantly weird as the Crawler or the writing inside the tower.

Really, the only thing that bugs me is the Border itself being so visible. A huge theme of the book was that nobody *really* knows the extent of the Border, and that the Border may not even really exist as a tangible boundary. Maybe its appearance is explained as an illusion imposed by the hypnosis, though. Hypnotising people to believe that the Border exists as a bright line across the landscape is totally something the Southern Reach would do.&&I swear, I don't recall any of those visuals from the book OR the audiobook. Really baffled at the look of the movie. It looks interesting for sure, but, just, ehh, what? Did I read a different book?&&I highly recommend giving Sunshine a go as well. &&FYI Stalker is based on *The Roadside Picnic* by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, and a lot of its imagery comes from the book.&&Hm, with this book, I expect the movie to be quite different necessarily. The movie has to show some stuff that is only hinted at in the book, while a lot of internal changes will be externalized I expect.&&if you're worried that reading the book will explain everything and ruin the mystery, don't worry, you'll be fine.&&Yes, exactly. When I read a book and then watch a movie, I feel like the movie failed to portray everything I imagined. If I read the book after the movie, I feel like I can imagine the things I've already scene so it matches up; which is okay by me. &&Other times you spend the first hundred pages or so wondering why the Bourne supremacy is nothing like the movie&&Generally I see where you're coming from, but the trilogy is so weird and ambiguous, this case might be the exception to that rule. For your health. &&I usually do the opposite actually, because reading the book first makes you wonder how what you read can be translated on screen. I watch a lot of movies and I like writing, so when I want to study a movie I go book-> movie and when I want to study a book I go movie -> book. &&What didn’t you like? &&A lot of people didn't like it, actually. It has fairly mediocre ratings. I personally love it, definitely in my top 5, but many of my friends weren't impressed by it&&There's dozens of us, dozens!

It was pretty unoriginal, the theme has already been run to the ground already and it wasn't attempting to do anything fresh or spin it differently but I guess they made it more approachable to the mass? The atmosphere wasn't tense, it was dull. I was waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did.

[The end and the AI intention was pretty obvious from the start. What I didn't expect was that the entire house was avoiding all safety regulation: can't contact the outside, doors somehow lock themselves when there's no power. What a convenient Deus Ex!](#spoiler).

&&This is a great recommendation.&&That's a great way to describe the books, gonna use that in future if you don't mind&&What if I can't stand Lovecraft, Kafka bores me but I loved Roadside Picnic? Honest question.&&You should get a commission.

To Amazon I gooooo...&&It wasn't quite that bad for me, but I can't remember the last time I read a book and felt genuine unease. This did it for me. As a 29 year old man I thought I was in a place where books couldn't do that. (Also Handmaiden's Tale)&&Well, as a die-hard, favorite-tv-show-of-all-time fan of Lost, I can tell you: not having many questions answered is the sort of thing we like:)&&I'd suggest you wait. As I [recently shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/72kq03/new_image_from_annihilation_natalie_portman_oscar/dnjaoil/?context=3), I think this movie will surpass the book, so I sort of wish I hadn't spoiled the movie with the book... if that makes sense. Maybe wait and see - if the movie gets insanely good reviews, then watch it first! &&She said she couldn't get work in press interviews for Hateful Eight. &&Also *Atypical*, which was a fun, if not particularly challenging, show&&There seems to be an age ""gap"" that female actors fall into somewhere around 40. I'm sure someone has studied it or put together stats, but I imagine it has something to do with why we see these aging male stars being paired with women 20 years their junior in mainstream films.

*Edit* maybe I read about this before and forgot about it but there are a bunch of articles out there about the Hollywood gender age gap.&&She's great in Good Time also.&&The third book I'm not sure there was much to be done, but the second book could have been great! He should have had flashbacks to the original expedition and paralleled their growing unease and distress with what was happening at The Southern Reach.&&Same, writing style felt different, switching from 1st person to 3rd person did the book no favors. &&Oh dude, I gotta see and read this then!&&I disagree. It’s weird fiction but not Lovecraftian. I’m pretty sure Jeff Vandermeer has stayed many times hat Lovecraft is not an influence on his work. &&P, IT'S FOR PUSSY!&&Aaaand finished it this morning. What a mindfuck.&&I recall reading a comment from Vandermeer explicitly saying he was unfamiliar with Roadside Picnic when he wrote the series. I can't find it now but [here is a tweet from him](https://twitter.com/jeffvandermeer/status/754674019174060032) saying Annihilation is not a tribute to Picnic/Stalker. &&How is that book? I've been looking to purchase it for a bit now, but I'm backlogged on books and wasn't able to read much as I'd had hoped this summer. &&No not because the plot is complicated. Because it is more of a metaphysical/conceptual story. If you are looking for answers to mysteries--this is not a movie for you. &&The plot is remarkably simply. In short, the setup is ""Here is Area X. It may be expanding. It is a zone that the government says is off limits. You don't understand Area X. The Southern Reach, the government agency dedicated to researching Area X, doesn't understand Area X. A team of four women is sent into Area X to investigate. Officially, they are the twelfth expedition. They go into Area X, and...""

The plot unfolds from there. It is confined in action to Area X and the Southern Reach. Its cast of characters can be counted comfortably on two hands. Explaining the plot, such as it is, in any more detail is impossible. 

The whole Southern Reach trilogy of novels are amazing. Dark, moody, atmospheric, filled with terrific prose. It's as if Jeff Vandermeer wrote them in a fever dream. They surpass anything he's written before (and he's a great writer). They will likely be his life's crowning achievement. Changing them for the big screen is a tall order, but I have confidence in the crew that is making this movie.&&Because the plot is not really revealed in the first book at all.  Its like only watching the first season of lost.  &&Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead...&&Holy crap that's an amazing summary. None of that ever registered to me when I was reading it. I've got all three on audiobook and can't remember anything much in either #2 or #3. Gonna go back to #3 just to find this part explained.&&Not to start a flame war, but I honestly liked the ambiguity of the zone in Roadside Picnic better.

[In Roadside Picnic, the whole point was that the ""zone"" was some kind of stopover of a incredibly advanced and alien presence, and the ""how"" and ""why"" was almost inherently unknowable. The title of the book comes from the observation that if a bunch of humans stopped and had a roadside picnic on their way somewhere, the ants that stumbled on their detritus would be unable to comprehend the purpose or nature of anything that they left behind.](#spoiler)

I've never liked it when SciFi authors feel it necessary to explain advanced technology/strange cultures in a way that makes logical sense to the reader.&&Man I completely forgot about that. The whole trilogy just feels like a fading fever dream to me.&&[I didn't get the impression it was a purpose-built machine. Just something... alien... like maybe not even from this universe, that somehow ended up in what became Area X and by the very nature of its interactions began irrevocably changing Earth. I got hints that it may have been a terraforming machine, a la James S.A. Corey's Protomolecule, but it could've also just been a cosmic splinter that got lodged in the earth and had an interesting infection spread. The very denial of conscious agency to the splinter was what made the novels such effective cosmic horror. Bad shit was happening to the Earth, probably going to kill everyone, and it was all because of some giant fluke that just sort of... happened. Chilling.](#spoiler)&&Man, reading the book wouldn't even spoil the book for you.&&Maybe I'll do what I did with 2001 A Space Odyssey. I watched 2001 first, read the book then re-watched the movie and I loved it even more.&&It won't be spoiled. Two different media. The books are a magical meditation on setting and a great example of very fine prose and cosmic horror. The movie may be good, excellent even, but your appreciation of seeing good filmmakers translate Vandermeer's words to the screen would exceed any loss of enjoyment you might feel at ""knowing"" the solution to the central plot mystery. &&Someone else here pointed out that the third book in fact does explain. 

I read all three and loved them to pieces but it's still news to me. &&Exactly. How many actual hardcore storytellers are there that can write good, original, blockbuster-caliber stories for film studios? 

I feel like a lot of the original movies lately have been indie smash hits, pet projects of well-known comedians or actors, and/or low quality CGI nightmares. 

(Successful) Book authors are already battle-tested since they can craft worlds and stories from letters on a page, so aside from some rare totally original script/story from a film writer, why not follow the lead of someone's fleshed-out work?&&I swear I've seen this comment before on a thread about _Annihilation_&&Also: Planet of the Apes, Psycho, the Stephen King movies (Shining, Shawshank, etc).&& A fan of tiny biscuits.

Jingham, Marco, and the Blue Princess would be insufferable with anyone reading their lines.  The one thing they do seem to get right though is giving Kublai a ton of monologues and Benedict Wong is incredible when he's let loose to just chew scenery.  &&yes&&Been a long time since I've played a game with a much of a sense of ""place"" as Prey. That station was incredibly well designed as a space.&&Is it worth taking another look? I tried getting back into that game, but it didn't pull me in like Bioshock and Dead Space.&&Yeah, it wasn't something I thought about much until Prey presented me with an Asian American protagonist, and it definitely stood out to me. The only others have been Mirrors Edge and Sleeping dogs where they were still ninja/kungfu experts. 

Though this time he was still a scientist, at least it was in a scenario where almost everyone in the game is a scientist, so it wasn't playing into any stereotypes. I really appreciate seeing Asian American guys being depicted as normal. That's the goal state of feeling accepted.&&I wish they made the stuff other than the Kublai Khan story arc good. 
Or just made the show just about Kublai, because let's be real, Fans of Marco Polo show didn't give a shit about Marco Polo the character.&&Well, shit. I was wondering why there hadn't been an announcement of new episodes. &&There are dozens of us.

DOZENS!&&Aren't we all?&&That's a cute idea thx &&Going from Solaris to Event Horizon would be just a jarring tonal shift. Not saying it wouldn't work, but it would definitely be funny/interesting to go from a 2 hour and 40 minute meditative sci-fi film about grief and the way humanity interacts with a 'sentient' planet beyond our comprehension to a sc-fi horror movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. It's his best work in my opinion, but I don't know if it stacks up with the other two in the list. Though, I guess all three are essentially about contacting alien 'lifeforms' that are beyond our comprehension as 3 dimensional meat bodies and how that would affect us.&&I'd throw in Attack of the Clones.&&> Solaris, Event Horizon, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Stop in the middle of Alligator Alley sometime, and look North or South, you'll come to the realization that if you went those directions, you'd just be one more dead person in the Everglades.&&As someone who didn't read the book, this was complete gibberish and it makes me even more excited for this movie &&In Authority, the sequel, the entrance to Area X is described as a swirling wall of impossible light twenty feet tall and twelve feet wide even though the border is invisible. I'd say they've got a great swirling wall of impossible light going on in that teaser, it's just bigger than in the books.&&I'm with you. I was hoping to see the rabbits vanish.

But all in all, I'm very excited to see this version. &&I think they'll drop the hypnosis because in the book they wake up inside the border, here you see them walk in.&&Can you spoiler alert the book for me? I have patience and i want to know what this is about.&&The plant person outlines? That was in the book, maybe not quite the same way. 

Also the cave with the particles. The barren flat landscape. The foliage glowing. That was all in the book. 

I don’t remember the barrier into X to have been visible at all.

I read Annihilation after reading The Ruins, so I think I was kind of primed for a bunch of its subtle weirdness and horror. &&The books played the long con, the movie looks like it's playing the short game.&&It's nice to see someone else mention Sunshine. The actual science was a little off, but it was so damn good that I almost didn't care. &&Sorry, that's the book I was referring to-- not the Stalker game or movie.&&It also looks like they're gonna use content from the other books to make one movie. As far as I'm aware, they're not making the others into movies are they?&&A great read. Also a total mind fuck, so many questions. &&Sure, go ahead, just send me the royalties.&&Well, depends of what you don't like about Lovecraft and Kafka. It has Lovecraftian body horror and Kafkaesque existential dread, but the plot is very Roadside Picnic, since it's about an area touched by a (maybe extraterrestrial) presence and turned into a dangerous wilderness that changes mind and body.&&Have you read House of Leaves?&&Genuine unease is the perfect way to describe how this book made me feel. Thank you, I'm going to use that to talk a few horror story fan friends of mine into reading it. &&That's craziness. She's amazing on screen. She must suck to work with or something&&Really enjoyed her work in Atypical.&&Beg to differ. I think the shift underscored the tension between Control and the biologist, made it more difficult to discern if the biologist's behavior was due to what she had previously described throughout book one or if something else was going on. Plus, when the biologist is encountered ""again"" in book three, it went a long way (for me anyway) to understanding what Area X is, or at least the extent of its affects on those who enter. I don't think that arc could have been achieved without the shift from first to third person. Mah two cents.&&Wow, than that's just an eerie similarity.&&The book is amazing, and also a really quick and easy read. I practically read it in one sitting. &&It's really good. The writing is weirdly stilted in a way that adds to the strangeness of the setting.&&By the end of the third book, the plot isn't even revealed. It's hinted, suggested at, maybe even subtly implied. But it's an amazingly good job by Vandermeer to offer you a mystery that can't be cracked, and yet is still fun to puzzle over.&&I tried to read this but the words kept moving and shifting.&&IIRC it's explained during a vision ~~Control~~ Ghost Bird has. Find the part about an exploding planet, it stands out clearly from the rest of the narrative.

Edit: not Control. Ghost Bird.&&To be fair, he does, but the explanation is very very subtle. I doubt most people even understood it by the way it was presented. I recall it being no longer than one paragraph in a three book series.

Edit: Also the point of the books is not how or why any of this happened. It's an analogy for what we are doing to our own planet.&&Here's the passage:

[""She saw or felt, deep within, the cataclysm like a rain of comets that had annihilated an entire biosphere remote from Earth. Witnessed how *one made* organism had fragmented and dispersed, each minute part undertaking a long a perilous passage though spaces *between*, black and formless, punctuated by sudden light as they came to rest, scattered and lost - emerging only to be buried, inert, in the glass of a lighthouse lens. And how, brought out of dormancy, the wire tripped, how, best as it could, regenerated, begun to perform a vast and preordained function, one compromised by time and context, by terrible truth that the species that had given Area X purpose was gone.""](#spoiler)

[The part about it being made, and having a preordained function by a species makes me think that it was a machine, biological or otherwise](#spoiler)&&This is somehow so spot on&&Reddit is a flat circle&&Let's not forget Netflix's *Marco Polo*, where he, IMO, plays [*Kublai Khan*](https://imgur.com/a/UK3V3) spectacularly well!

 &&Come n wipe yer hands on me coat!&&I was super hyped for Electric Dreams, but I'm not liking it as much as I was hoping I would.&&It can get quite chilly. &&Meryl Streep, is that you?&&Or Jeff Portnoy style. &&Hundred Eyes was 🔥🔥&&I actually enjoyed the show altogether, sure it had some writing mishaps but none of the actors/actresses were terrible. Some of them were actually really good, like Benedict Wong and Tom Wu (Hundred Eyes).&&Yeah, the Prince got better once he stopped being so snooty towards Marco.&&Absolutely, easily one of the best games to be released this year, even if that isn't saying much. 

The way that game handles space walks is awesome. &&Exactly. Master of None does this really well, by just having a diverse cast living regular lives in NYC. John Cho in Selfie was good too, although that didn’t get renewed.

That being said, I really liked Sleeping Dogs. Sure it played into triad stereotypes but I loved the depth of the story. They really made an effort on that one and HK was an integral part of the game, not just some background gimmick.&&Season 2 found the right formula.  Less Marco and more Kublai.

It's a shame we'll never get a resolution to the cliffhanger at the end of the season.&&[deleted]&&Why, for someone who knows how to add and subtract and multiply and divide lots of numbers to get one other number, you're not so good at putting two and two together, are you?&&>It’s a nice swamp. 

Spoilers: late in the film, they venture back in for the final climactic encounter. A lumbering figure emerges from the mist and bellows “WHAT ARE YE DOIN IN MA SWAMP.” It’s Shrek. The movie was actually a hardcore sci-fi reimagining of Shrek the whole time&&For the night is dark and full of meth.&&Well it's a swamp. That much we can agree on. &&Hahah you have no idea. 

It's like ""Lost"" but it actually makes sense in the end.&&As someone who picked up the book after seeing the promo picture they released yesterday, I have to say it's definitely worth the read. It's relatively short, too. I think most people could finish it in one to two sittings, but I can assure you that doesn't take away from it, at all. It's well paced and most definitely a page turner.&&Yeah, fair point, the entrance itself did have some trippy visual stuff going on. I guess I just didn't expect it here, because the transition isn't actually described in *Annihilation*.&&I remember them having to be hypnotized before they went though or they would go crazy.&&I hope they don't. Hypnosis doesn't mean they had to be walking zombies, it just means that they were put under and given... whatever imperative they needed to be able to make it through.&&IIRC they were hypnotized when they originally crossed into Area X. I may be wrong though, its been a while.&&You can't play a long con in a movie. It has to look like something, because the audience can see it, lol.  

Otherwise you spend an hour and a half trying to avoid putting something in the shot.&&It was good fun scifi &&[deleted]&&The director said in an interview he wasn't interested in making a trilogy of films. 



> Although the original book is part of a trilogy, Garland says he regards his film as a standalone movie. “I did once work on a film called Dredd, which I imagined to be the first part of a trilogy,” says Garland. “But it’s not something I like doing. I’d rather work on a story that I felt was self-contained rather than one that sort of had a ‘dot-dot-dot’ at the end. I think that provokes a sort of instant, understandable, cynicism. We sense the money grab and I feel that pollutes the story. So, right from the get-go, I did not think of this as being part of a trilogy; I thought of it as being just a single, self-contained movie. If other people wanted to do that, that would be fine. That’s none of my business. But from my point of view, it’s just one.”

[Source](http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/26/annihilation-natalie-portman-alex-garland/) &&i believe it's a stand alone film and i'm ok with that. Book 2 and 3 don't add that much beyond very slowly revealing the answers. The film can either do that more quickly or simply not answer them and it'll work fine either way.&&[deleted]&&Maybe because they all owe a debt to Lovecraft's The Colour Out Of Space.&&This. It's short, punchy, and very good. &&Awesome share and insight, thank you for it. 

It's not an ""right answer"" about what is definitively happening, b/c this book doesn't have that, but it's a cool way to think about it. 

Each narrator in the book is looking for answers - in some cases to similar but different questions, in other cases to the same question - and Vandermeer does such an incredible job of going deep into their psyches, showing how thorny it is to wade through one's own being to find an answer to something as, well, alien as Area X.  
&&wth... I just stuck a knife into a beer can...&&ka is a wheel&&What is that Nietchze? FUCK YOU!&&He's *amazing* as Khan.&&I came looking for some form of ""Kublai wants to know""  comment and yes you are correct he was spectacular.
&&Hello Mum. It's your third youngest here. Errol. The Chinese one...&&Fuck yes Hundred Eyes! Best character in the show&&I really liked Sleeping Dogs too, they were triads, but the characters were humanized rather than being played up as caricatures. That game was shockingly good given it's development history. &&it’s a metaphor on how to ruin a great movie. really powerful stuff&&I would have to kill myself after seeing that as nothing could possibly top that.&&SOURCE: somebody once told me&&>and full of meth

Hey now, we don't just have meth. We have bath salts as well. &&Here's my question, yesterday people on reddit were saying the first one is awesome but the second is bad and the third is meh. Can I read the first as a standalone book? Is it its own story?&&So everyone is dead and this is Purgatory?&&>It's like ""Lost"" but it actually makes sense in the end.

Books 2 and 3 answer a lot of questions, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it makes sense in the end.  It's been a long time since I read it, but I remember thinking there were loose ends that were never tied up.&&care to explain? trailer made me curious, so i read the plot summary of all 3 books... it really seems like they're about nothing

the ending to the 3rd book isnt really an ending.... so is there a 4th coming? or am i missing something here? what is all this about and how does it end

PS I LOVE SPOILERS &&I read it few months ago but the writing style was a bit thick and overly descriptive. I plowed thru it and swore I wouldn't bother with the second book but after finishing Annihilation the overall theme had me gripped. I figure give it a go soon on the second.&&She turned around though. All she saw was white fuzz that she couldn't describe. &&House of Leaves currently stands as my favorite book. Nothing else has been able to capture the feeling HoL gave me, but from what i've been hearing this book seems very promising. &&I agree with you on both counts; they are totally immersive mind fuck books.  &&Man, I love the idea behind house of leaves and was super excited to read it when I bought it but I just have a hell of a time getting in to it. I think I've read the first 50 or so pages twice since I picked it up a couple years ago. I don't know what it is about it, but it just doesn't grab me off the hop and I fall asleep. I powered through the first three Dark Tower books in the last six weeks or so and read close to an eighth of IV on Sunday when I picked it up, but HoL just doesn't suck me right in :( that being said I am going to go get myself a copy of Annihilation tonight. &&I think I did House of Leaves in about three days as well, every single moment of the day I had free, I had to read it because it made me feel so uneasy.  Needed to finish it to get rid of the anxiety of being in my own house.&&There are similarities there too, yeah. Though I doubt the Strugatzkys were aware of Lovecraft, or at least this particular story. Then again, it's possible, after all Stanislaw Lem also read Philip K. Dick, considering him the only ""serious"" Western scifi author.&&Really? I thought it was pretty clear what Area X is and what caused it.

Ghost Bird, Control's cell phone, and what happened to the Lighthouse keeper after touching a shard of the mirror, the dolphin, why technology doesn't work.

All of it really is explained by that part in the book that I referenced. I wish had a copy here so I could paste it.&&Netflix could have had a cool origin story with him. I think they did a small one&&It would be all ogre for you&&Can someone explain this joke to me? I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.&&And in the Cuban/richer parts, Cocaine!

*Cocaine^^tm: God's way of telling you that you have too much money*&&I thought the first book did a good job of creating a creepy and interesting environment, but was lacking in character development or plot.  Nonetheless, a good sci-fi/horror mystery.  The best of the trilogy.  It's not exactly a standalone story because you'll have a lot of questions that you think the sequels might answer...but don't bother, because the sequels are devoid of answers.  The author created a creepy and interesting environment, but he has no idea what to do with it.

The second book, Authority, was heavy on character development, but at the expense of anything else.  This book lacks whatever made the first compelling.  There's little plot or action.  A complete bore, even for someone who doesn't mind slower and subtler fiction.  You'll wonder what was the point of reading it.

As far as the third book, I agree with the other commenter who described it as a muted reprise of the first one.  Still boring and frustrating as you hope, to no avail, that everything you've read will actually lead somewhere.

All in all, I think the first book is decent, but it's overall a lazily-written series that tries to use its ""weirdness"" as an excuse for a complete failure to construct a coherent plot.&&Honestly it's hard for me to say. They were all released 3 months apart from each other, and I'm such a huge fan of Vandermeer's work that I read them back to back to back, so they feel like one book to me.

I guess only reading just the first book would be like watching the first season of Lost and then stopping.

I would say try the first one, and if you feel like you want the mysteries to be resolved, read the next two.

&&First one is great in its eeriness, mystery, and psychedelic body horror.

Second one is almost a behind the scenes appendix of events in the first. Has a lil paranoia, a lil mystery (with some earlier questions being answered), a lil horror, but not very strong in any category. It's mostly about an office worker in the govt. agency that sends them into Area X. A few creepy bits, but lotsa dull bureaucracy stuff in sharp contrast with the first. Had it been shorter, scarier, weirder, or faster paced it would have been fine. (I think VanderMeer made it Kafka-esque just to try something different, but it doesn't work too well in this trilogy).

The third kinda has the emotional payoff of the series, the paths of different characters converge (our two books deep familiarity with all of them makes us feel much more attached), it ties threads from the first two together nicely, and explains the origin of a lot of the chaos in powerful way. Some action-y or tense adventure stuff, some horror, and some feelings of closure. I cried a bit.


All in all I was glad I read them, but it took a weekend, and I was kinda pissed how some things would just drag (if they could condense 2 & 3 into a single, crazier book it would have been near perfect). But I wanted thrills and chills and weird shit and madness and wtf moments, and there's a good amount of those in these books.




***~Edit~***

Other books that were similar to me:

**Roadside Picnic** (on which Stalker is based (Good, with almost the same premise, but I found Area X to be better)).

**Hyperion** (Similarly weird mystery sci-fi, but told in very different genre styles depending on the character (the first book is great, but the later ones felt like a waste of time))

**The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch** (Insane, drug fueled Philip K. Dick book where reality is shattered all over the place) 


**M. John Harrison's Light** (Daring, morbid, and comically fucked up. Probably loved it the most of these. A serial killer physicist is haunted by a creature of nightmare, a woman in the far future has surgically merged with her killing machine spaceship, and a wastoid VR addict must run from those that would like to see him dead at any cost)


**Finch** (also by VanderMeer, it's a hard boiled detective/mushroom noir story)

&&Yeah, it's pretty self-contained.

Personally, I think the sequels were great, but I also went into them being familiar with VanderMeer's previous work. If this is your first exposure, you'll probably be caught off guard by some of the stylistic experimentation he does, especially in *Acceptance*.&&I don't agree with anyone that would say that.  The second is one of the most engrossing and fantastic books I've ever read.  It creates a palpable sense of dread with an incredible story resolution that works as a wonderful climax.  I couldn't put it down.&&But that's not how it...*sigh*...nevermind&&The ending doesn't actually make any sense. The series uses Sci-Fi more as a medium for the Horror/mystery aspect. It's not a Sci-fi in the sense where anything actually gets explained.

So it makes sense in the way the numbers in Lost made sense (they don't explain it is the answer).&&I think there were some loose ends, but he explains exactly what made Area X when [Ghost Bird touches the Crawler in chapter 22 of Acceptance](#spoiler)&&I will warn you, the second book is a bit slow until about halfway through. If you struggled with the first, it may be a bit of a slog.

But, there is a scene at about the 3/4 mark that is the first time a book has given me the full-body fear reaction/muffled-scream from just *reading* since I was a kid.

And the ending was so intense, I can only hope they film a second movie just to put that to screen.&&I suggest just skipping the Johnny parts and focus on the Navidson Report. Or maybe just heed the warning at the start of the book, ""this is not for you.""&&THANK YOU! Reading the comments here I just though I missed a ton while reading the book. The whole time reading the book and after I just kept thinking this sounds like coked up sprawling. There is no plot just lots of events.&&You’ll be happy to hear that the movie takes huge liberties from the book and doesn’t set up for any sequels. I saw a screening of it a while back and it was amazing.&&I'm sort of okay with the way it played out.  The second half of _Authority_ had one of the most uncomfortable scenes out of all three, but in total I'm okay with the way nothing was resolved.  It was very much like _Sphere_ in that way for me, the ending left me frustrated and uncomfortable, which was the author's whole point of the series.  

I would have felt more closure, may have even enjoyed it more if there was a nicer wrap up at the end that answered my questions, but even now I'm still uncomfortable thinking about the series and I kind of like that. I can see how others wouldn't, but it worked for me. &&Thanks for the thorough reply. Think I'd be good by reading the first one and then reading a summary of the second and third ones? If I feel like getting some closure, I mean.&&I have a friend who's a huge fan of Lost try and tell me the whole show was purgatory and I just don't understand how anyone who watches the show can come to that conclusion by the end of it&&Whoa.  Are you at liberty to provide more details on the liberties?&&I mean, you could really borrow and *try* reading them. Personally I found Authority to be an absolute struggle, but there are people who were blown away by it. 

There's some really memorable imagery which won't leave any sort of impression from a summary (eg. the creepy imagery regarding the rabbits and closet in Authority, the bar and island in Acceptance) in both sequels in my opinion, though I agree the first is the best which is helped out by its shortness (it's less than 200 pages if I recall).

Also disagree that there's no character development, it's just not so overt or smooth (felt like a fair bit at the end of the book) but certainly agree about the plot, which is very meandering.&&Eh, I mean I get it, especially to a more casual viewer. The purgatory thing was definitely a red herring.
  
I'm rewatching now and there's even one scene where Jacob talks about them being judged before they can 'cross over' or something, so I can see how that would be a conclusion to jump to.&&If you never really underestand what the flash-sideways universe is, I guess you can extrapolate that the whole show is the purgatory and not just those sequences. I guess.&&Right?!

The real conclusion was that everything after season 3 was pulled out of my asshole while I slept right?

It all seemed very familiar at least.&&",2017-09-27 10:01:40

**Notable Box Office Stories:** 

* There's always something interesting about a follow-up to a surprising hit and **Kingsman: The Golden Circle** is in the rare category of just kind of more of the same as the film opened at #1 to $39M. In comparison Kingsman: The Secret Service opened at #2 in February of 2015 to $36.2M (weirdly as counter-programming to 50 Shades of Grey instead of vice-versa) so we aren't exactly looking at the huge increase we often see with a sequel to a well reviewed film. It's also not great that Kingsman: TGC had a lot more runway than the previous film with two weeks out from IT and opening against an underperforming kids film. Now all of this to say that there's nothing terribly wrong here. The budget is still about the same, $100M v the $94M of the original. The real question will be the hold as the original had a fantastic multiplier of 3.5x and in that it's hard to necessarily see Kingsman: TGC repeating that figure. That sort of multiplier indicates a film that audiences were initially suspicious of but good word of mouth brought them in on second, third, fourth, etc. weekends. I feel like now audiences know what it is and either didn't care enough for the sequel or are just burnt out. Still it did receive the same Cinemascore as the original (B+) so if it does multiply to 3.5x or more I will gladly eat my words. The other big factor is overseas where the film is seeing more of that traditional sequel bump. The film grossed $61.2M this weekend overseas, pushing the worldwide gross over $100M in its opening weekend. It saw almost double the premiere of Kingsman: TSS in the UK ($11.1M versus $6.4M) and had great openings in Russia and Taiwan. The real big markets though are yet to come, namely South Korea and China which went big for Kingsman: TSS (China: $74.6M, South Korea: $46.8M). Overall Kingsman: TGC is performing a lot like the golden era of Bond movies it emulates (see Roger Moore era in particular) just trucking along making good solid profits enough to justify the next incarnation hoping that will be the massive hit. 

* Boy the life of the LEGO animated franchise has been fascinating as the third of the franchise opened to an extreme franchise low as **The LEGO Ninjago Movie** opened at #3 with $21.2M. That marks it opening more than $30M less than The LEGO Batman Movie and more than $45M less than The LEGO Movie. While most expected Ninjago to open less than those films it's still a markedly low opening for a franchise that's just not been fulfilling on the promise of the first film. Speaking of surprise hits The LEGO Movie was a big one, coming in with no expectations to open with $69M and had a fantastic multiplier closing it's run at $257.7M. So expectations were very high for LEGO Batman which while a spin-off features one of the most profitable movie heroes ever yet it opened lower than LEGO Movie and had no staying power, closing just under $300M worldwide. In comparison a similarly budgeted movie without the massive branding of LEGO or Batman, The Secret Life of Pets, managed to make 2x as much as LEGO Batman domestically and 2.8x as much worldwide. And now we get to Ninjago which also had franchise lows in every foreign market it opened in. Certainly after LEGO Batman the writing was on the wall because if that film couldn't expand it's brand then what would happen to a film based on a popular if not universally beloved LEGO TV show that's not even a direct continuation of said show? Almost certainly WB will be waiting now with baited breath for what will happen financially with The LEGO Movie Sequel because it's not looking good for the LEGO brand, despite good reviews, because the audiences just aren't connecting like WB thought they would. 

* It seems the suspiciously named Entertainment Studios (come on that has Yakuza front written all over it) couldn't quite recapture the surprising success of 47 Meters Down as their latest direct-to-DVD-quality-but-direct-to-theaters film **Friend Request** opened pitifully at #7 with $2.4M. The film was already release by Warner Bros overseas last year and is already on Region 2 blu-ray, so this screams another direct to DVD film that just was released in hopes of making a big hit. With a $6M budget this isn't really a film as much as a minor investment that's not paying off. Hopefully ES can recoup with 48 Meters Down...not even kidding, that's literally the title. 

* So before I give the record **IT** broke this weekend I will note your opinion on this record will vary greatly on A) what you define as a horror movie and B) how much you care about inflation. Let's state the record first and then we'll get all nerdy with it. This weekend IT passed the lifetime domestic gross of The Exorcist ($232.9M) earning $266.3M making it the highest grossing R-rated horror film ever. Okay so first up the horror definition. I've seen a lot of articles this week that IT is now the highest grossing horror film period. However while certainly no one doubts The Exorcist as a horror film there is one film that is defined as horror on Box Office Mojo that stands above IT still, The Sixth Sense with a lifetime gross of $293.5M. Now some define this film as a thriller but to me it's a horror film and especially one if Box Office Mojo defines it as such, however if you disagree then IT already is the highest grossing horror film overall. Not that it matters much since almost certainly IT will become the first horror film of any qualification to gross over $300M domestic and shatter Sixth Sense's record so just wait a week or two if you agree with me. And since Exorcist is rated R and Sixth Sense is PG-13 then there is still a major record here. Okay now on to the inflation stuff which is my personal little pet peeve. Now obviously you are probably thinking, wow $232.9M is a lot of 1970s money, and you're mostly right. It's crazy impressive that The Exorcist held it's record for 40 years and it still stands on the adjusted for inflation chart as the 9th highest grossing film of all time with $983M. Now to start picking nits that number is not totally accurate because actually Exorcist made $193M in its original run but the adjusted and the overall gross account for various re-releases over the years. Part of my problem with adjusted for inflation numbers is most of those films came out long before home video so re-releases were a big damn deal cause it was the only way to see a film for many was a re-release (this is more of a note about Gone with the Wind than The Exorcist who's big re-release was in 2000). The other issue is that we use incredibly broad math to define these things, as not only is inflation calculation incredibly broad but a lot of this is based on rough out-molded data long before the days of daily tracking. But even if you trust the math completely I don't think it should define your opinion. Look I totally get why seeing adjusted one film making $266M versus another making $983M makes the former look like chump change. Ultimately my main thing is don't let inflation calculation take away from either film, both runs are incredibly impressive and important to the industry. The thing is box office defines the kinds of films that will be made and while The Exorcist's run is incredible, it doesn't define right now outside of bad marketing tropes. IT is going to define the next 5-10 years of horror films, much like Exorcist did for ita day. If you want to bring up inflation in the comments be my guest but just remember all of this stuff is about context. Don't let shakey at best math only define what a hit is to you or not because then only the highest of the high notes will even come close to being enough.

","**Films with updates not on follow list**

* **mother!** - The latest from Darren Aronofsky got a decent amount of attention for becoming the 19th film to ever get the infamous F rating on Cinemascore. Since Cinemascore is usually used as a predictor for a film's domestic legs I figured I'd compare the second weekend to other F Cinemascores.  Going through I found an average second weekend drop for F rated films at 57.3% with The Devil Inside having the worst drop with 76.2% (perhaps not surprisingly it also is far and away the biggest opening for an F rated film with $33.7M) and Darkness '04 having the best drop with 25.1% (likely due to its holiday release). mother! therefore fits in well with the rest as this weekend it dropped 56.7% grossing $3.2M this weekend. Surprisingly these drops weren't as dramatic as I expected but one thing I found is most of these F rated films opened terribly anyways so it seems audience could smell their hatred for these films and just avoided them in the first place. By the way check out comments below this sticky comment, I'll post all the second weekend drops for every F Cinemascore movie. 

* **Stronger** - For those curious how the Jake Gyllenhaal biopic about a victim of the Boston Bombing did in it's 574 theater opening this weekend, the answer is...okay? It opened at #9 with $1.7M, a per theater average of $3,045. Solid opening but definitely not the outsized hit that helps lead a Best Actor Oscar campaign which is clearly a big draw of this film.

**Notable film closings**

* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** - Seems to be a week of sequels to surprise hits as GOTG 2 closed to an excellent if not record breaking $389.8M domestic and $863.4M worldwide on a budget of $200M. Outside of opening $50M higher than its predecessor GOTG 2 wasn't too big of a leap above the previous film, making just a little bit more, making $50M domestic and $100M more worldwide. The only real down turn was the domestic legs. GOTG 3.5x multiplier while GOTG 2 closed to a 2.68x multiplier, a dramatic change echoed by the fact the film was passed domestically during it's run by Wonder Woman which opened $40M less. This film operated like a sequel with a bigger expanded opening but the overall cultural sway just wasn't there like some expected. Still making over $850M on a $200M budget is a win in any book.

* **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales** - Seems despite very little attention in the US, Captain Jack still holds sway over the international markets as the fifth Pirates film closed to a good $172.5M domestic and $794M worldwide on a budget of $230M. In the US it seemed the film would face the same fate as Transformers 5, with the worst opening of the Pirates sequels by a mile and became the only Pirates film to not pass $200M domestic. However the love for Pirates overseas is still strong as the film grossed $621M abroad, mostly lead by perennial fav China ($172.2M) as well as Japan ($59.5M) and Russia ($40.8M). While the domestic gross puts the worldwide numbers far below the other sequels, the foreign take is about the same as Pirate 2 and 3 but nowhere near 4's take of $800M overseas. With the split between foreign and domestic growing for these sequels it's hard to know where Pirates stands. At least the film didn't follow the tradition of topping the previous Pirates film as the most expensive movie ever made, but it's still an expensive franchise that seems to be slowly...well sinking in the US and may not be strong enough overseas to keep it alive.

* **Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets** - The latest attempt to start a new sci-fi epic franchise has flopped closing at a terrible $40.4M domestic and $221.5 worldwide on a budget of $177M. While the film totally bombed in the US it managed a little better overseas especially in Luc Besson's native France. Also the films profits were couched by foreign sales with almost 90% of the films budget covered in pre sales. However the real detriment was this was supposed to be a launch for a new franchise and now puts EuropaCorp in dire straits trying to figure what to do next after posting a $134M loss for this year. &&Not surprised about the Ninjago movie. There wasnt too much hype for that movie.&&So Friend Request bombed so badly that it didn't even merit a commentary on the post.&&>IT has grossed $266.3M domestic, beating The Exorcist ($232.9M) as the highest grossing R-rated horror film ever.

Time for an Excorcist remake I guess

Not adjusted for inflation

There's also a TV show apparently &&I really love reading your weekly synopsis here every Monday. You do a great job.&&Golden Circle didn't quite measure up to the first Kingsman for me, but it was still a blast and I hope it makes enough to justify a third movie. I really wanna see more of this series.

It occurred to me while watching it that it's basically Spy Kids for adults. Gadgets that strain believability, villains that are almost cartoonish, absurdly over-the-top action, and all taken just seriously enough. I love it. Not straight comedy or parody but still great fun. With James Bond taking itself so seriously nowadays (which I also greatly enjoy), I feel like we really need a solid fun spy series.

Edit: To the folks pointing out how flawed Golden Circle was, yes, I know, it wasn't perfect and the first was definitely better. But it still delivered on most of the things I wanted to see (not nearly enough Jeff Bridges though) and I'm still willing to give them another shot.&&IT is missing like half its ticket sales from kids buying tickets to different movies and sneaking in&&Get ready for the hundreds of horror movies to come out in the next 5 years. Trying to catch the IT money &&I understand why Warner Bros. put Ninjago on September, it performs almost similarly to Storks, another movie by Warner that released on the third week of September.

I would say it is not bad but it is also not impressive but on the other hand Warner Bros. did a good job in diversification this weekend.&&I bet '**mother!'**s' F Cinemascore helped it's second weekend.&&""48 Meters Down"".  
Wow, they're really upping the stakes for the sequel.  
I can't think of anything more terrifying than an extra metre.&&Honestly, Ninjago movie wasn't as good as The Lego movie and Batman but I really liked it. The animation alone is amazing. I'm sure some people don't like it but the whole fast paced, meta self-aware humor that these lego movies have make them really unique compared to most animated films. With the low box-office though, I think Warner should focus more on known properties and stuff like Lego Movie in the beginning. Really felt like Ninjago was only hitting the children demographic.&&I'm willing to sacrifice my little brother to make sure Kingsman makes enough money to warrant a third one. 

I don't think The Golden Circle is as good as Secret Service but that doesn't make it bad. It's a lot better than most of the movies I've watched this year. I'm desperate to see more of this franchise and I'm gonna be bummed out if this is the last one.&&In defence of Ninjago, it doesn't open in Europe until mid-October.

Also, as a Lego Animation movie that belongs to a property that has only existed since 2011, this is a test to see if Lego can make films of their own properties and how successful they will be, especially amongst children.&&I really hope Kingsman does well enough to warrant a trilogy capper. I know some were disappointed, but I absolutely loved The Golden Circle. Both films have just been downright fun and the Taron Egerton/Colin Firth combo is fantastic. I couldn’t stand going through the thread for the film, people were nitpicking like crazy. &&Maybe not newsworthy, but this weekend Spider-Man: Homecoming surpassed GOTG Vol 2 to become the highest grossing film of the year so far

Edit: highest grossing superhero film &&Looks like the stars are fuckin aligning for Blade Runner!!&&And IT deserves the credit. I saw it yesterday and was sooo happy with a lot of the choices that were made in order to do an adaptation well. I mean, Stephen King stories can be hard to put to film, especially with kid actors, many characters, and how to do a movie that is expected to have a second part. After so many times that I've seen it done poorly it was just so excited to see how they creatively got past many difficult hurdles. Such kudos to whoever adapted the book, the director, and the studio. Really great decisions.&&As someone who worked in IT, i keep getting confused for a split second wondering how a movie about fixing office computers/servers is so popular before realizing we are talking about the Stephen King book. Its happened like 4 times now.&&Golden Circle was solid, obviously not better then the first, but still very enjoyable for anyone a fan of that type of movie. 

[The Merlin Country Road scene was so fucking awesome, some manly tears were shed that moment](#spoiler) &&If you don't adjust for inflation, no record is worth anything, because a movie eventually will pass it without merit. Give it enough time and a completely terrible and worthless movie will eventually surpass The Exorcist in the money it makes. Does that mean that shitty movie broke the record as well? Does that mean all the horror movies that follow from that point on will trounce the exorcist down the list?

If you don't adjust for inflation then ranking anything is pointless, as the biggest factor in who is on the top is time, not quality. &&The first Kingsman is one of my favorite films ever, and I'm shocked to see that people didn't like the second one.

Golden Circle was my most anticipated movie of the year and it actually met my expectations. Loved the story, perhaps more than the first one, but it was missing an iconic church scene like the first one had.&&The Lego Ninjago movie is out? Not heard anything about it since the first trailer a while back&&Just saw the Golden Circle yesterday. Really good film. I wasn't *as* floored as I was by the first film, but that's because the first Kingsman had some completely unexpected (and amazing) scene. It's like having a surprise birthday party 2 years in a row: you kind of expect it the second time, but it still manages to surprise you.

Overall a great film, and I *really* hope they turn this into a franchise!&&Vaughn really needs to step it up for Kingsman 3. I trusted him despite review scores but will only see 3 if people say it's good. 

Too early to tell if Kingsman's numbers will warrant The Rock being the next villain like Vaughn wants?&&Hopefully IT inspires writers to make horror movies more than cheap jump scares and demons possessing a house/person. Babadook is another good example of using horror as an analogy/allegory.&&How did everyone feel about the Kingsman movie? I didnt think it was as good as the first. I thought the movie dragged on a bit, but I also feel the pacing was too fast. So I'm confused.&&Lego Ninjago was not that great. according to my 4 year old son who loves the shit out of Ninjago ""there wasn't enough fighting""&&Just went to watch Kingsman: Golden circle last night, it was probably one of my favorite movies this year, the action packed plus goofy and funny scenes made it an extremely enjoying movie. I hope they make a third one.&&Boy I'd love to flop at 21.5 million dollars.&&How much more until it becomes the highest grossing R-Rated movie??&&Went to Golden Circle this weekend, and when walking out I thought “Wow that was pretty good. Almost on the same level as the first.”

Then later that night we watched the first one at home, and wow — not even close. Secret Service is way more charming and clever than Golden Circle. Both good movies, but the rank is clear in my opinion. &&It was a pretty good movie, the only I've seen of the list. Idk about best horror film of all time but it had all the right stuff and more than anything had likesble, believable protagonists, something most horror movies lack.&&Saw Kingsman: The Golden Circle yesterday night. Totally awesome.&&My 5 year old can't even say ""Ninjago"".  He was really excited about Lego Batman, but this brand did not connect with him at all.&&I think the novelty of the Lego movies has warn off.  Also, the first two had appeal for kids and adults.  But wtf is Ninjago?

I know that Ninjago is a popular line.  But it just doesn't have the appeal that the first movie had, which was extremely novel.  And it definitely doesn't have the batman appeal that was already a clear winner from the first movie.

If they start putting these things out every year, they're going to be straight to on demand sooner than later.&&Mother! Is quite a good movie , it's a bit of a headfuck and peopke with ADD won't like it.&&IT even got my money and I hadn't seen a movie at the theater in three + years.  &&I very much enjoyed Kingsman 2. If that were ever a full on book series, or a long-running graphic novel, I'd be invested. 

With that being said, dear lady who thought it'd be a good idea to bring your approx 8-10 yr old son to that movie, it was NOT a good idea and not only did I think you were trash when I first saw you in the lobby, you confirmed my suspicion when I saw you had your child in tow to a Rated R movie. &&It's just not a brand that would actually draw in audiences. Maybe at the height of Ninjago it would have done better but not now. The draw that Batman + Lego has is much better than just a stand-alone Lego property. 

Edit: people keep asking what a Ninjago is. [Have a look for yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Ninjago). It's Lego Ninjas.  &&Is that even considered a flop? Is that not what they expected to happen? Did anyone seriously think that a Lego Ninjago movie was going to make anywhere near as much as Lego Batman? They had to account for it, right? Doesn't flop mean does worse than expected?&&My son recently watched every damn episode. Then we saw commercials that did not look or _sound_ like the show. He said that was really odd and never showed any interest in seeing the movie. Hollywood needs to learn that throwing random famous people into the recording booth does not help the movie unless they are actually good voice actors. There was a CG animated film a few years ago and Beyonce's voice acting was the worst thing about it. Even worse than the shitty pop culture references and punched up jokes that severely dated what would have other wise been an almost timeless fantasy story.&&I don't even know what a Ninjago is. Is it some sort of Ninja Lego thing?&&I didn't even see a single trailer for it. They appeared to have used their marketing budget to strategically target children and moms. &&I wonder how much they have spent on marketing. I saw the original Lego movie and Batman on opening weekend. I didn't even know Ninjago was opening this past weekend. As a father of 3 boys, that's pretty bad marketing if I don't know it's out. &&This post is the first I’ve heard of it &&I'm a LEGO fan and my son watches Ninjago on Netflix routinely.  I didn't even realize the film was opening this weekend.  Someone screwed up badly in marketing.

I'm not a fan of Batman, but LEGO Batman was the best Batman movie I've seen in years.  Was very disappointed in the lazier rendering in this movie compared to The LEGO Movie.  I also thought it would have been great to tie out how the Batman movie was related to the LEGO movie by having a call back to the real world with the kid, sister, dad and mom involved.

I'm interested to see how the animation quality is on the Ninjago movie compared to the Batman movie.  Hopefully this won't be a further trend away from the amazing work that was done in the LEGO movie.

If the studio is trying to cheap out, they are making a huge mistake.  Part of what was so amazing about the first movie was the animation style and the depth and consistency of it.&&I don't understand how that's considered a ""flop"" if it's the number 3 movie and grossed over 21 mil.  If they lost money at that then they're doing something seriously wrong.&&I've never been more bored in a movie theater than I was during Lego Ninjago.

Not a surprise it flopped.&&Turning a 7 season kid's tv show into a 2 hour movie, or any tv show that long really, isn't ever going to work out well. The TV show has had time to develop all the ""main"" characters, but there's no way to convey much of that to a movie.&&I'm just mad it wrecked my FML. But yeah I forgot that even existed lol, I'll add it in.&&I was watching a Filmhaus podcast about Friend Request and it made me laugh so hard about how much they hated it, that I might just have to go see it this week. That's why I'm loving my Moviepass... the amount of shit movies I've seen just because they're free is hilarious. &&I'm Friends with a Ghost on Facebook.&&I saw Friend Request opening day.  I was the only one in the theater. &&Exorcist: Ginesyis&&Exorformers 6: Devils Attack&&Well the second season of the television show starts soon.&&Not sure directly comparing 2017 money to 1973 money makes much sense but I'm sure someone out there is already calculating the profits of yet another reboot that emphasizes the (exo)R(cist) and (p)R(equel).

&&It's just not at all a useful comparison if it's not adjusted for inflation. Why even bother to report that? I guess it sounds impressive until your brain realizes that inflation is a thing.&&[deleted]&&Did he account for inflation? &&Inflation adjusted I suspect The Exorcist did much (much) better. &&Thanks so much! 

Now someone pay me. &&Part of the reason I loved the first Kingsman was because I went into it with absolutely no expectations and was completely blown away by it. I'm nervous now that I will be expecting too much for the sequel and it won't live up to the memory of being blown away by the first one.&&I thought Man from UNCLE was a great light-hearted version of the Bond films honestly... such a shame it didn't perform up to par.&&I think my favorite bit about The Kingsman is that the ""bad guys"" are actually trying to solve world crises, albeit in some super-evil megalomaniacal way. First was combating climate change (but by killing the 99%) then it's [ending the war on drugs (but by threatening to kill all drug users unless drugs are made legal)](#spoiler). It'd be interesting to see what a third film would tackle. The bad guy is trying to stop all terrorism? But he's trying to destroy all governments and sent the world into anarchy? Hell, that would be awesome.&&It changed ""Country Road"" forever for me now though, been singing it for a day!&&In the next instalment Eggsy from the Kingsmen will be getting married and the Statesmen join them to form: The Groomsmen. 

What should have been a simple bachelor party becomes the most dangerous mission of their lives when Eggsy's bride is kidnapped Harry Hart is killed again. Lots of firefights and male fashion in slow motion. &&Both villains have been equally outlandish, but not normal. 

The Kingsman universe gives me like Far Cry vibes or some other games right before I'm about to sink hours into it and explore its world and inhabitants (and psychos) and I love it.

I also have a love/hate relationship with how they show the action. I love that it has so many stories within the fight and that each punch and attack / defense has a connection with the previous situation. The final fight scene was amazing in that regard. But my gripe with it is because of the way its shot and stylized, it gives me a small headache watching it. Nonetheless, I love it very much so and am excited when the camera starts to track punches in the first few moments of a fight because it means the start of a very entertaining sequence.

But most of the scenes still haven't topped the church scene from the first movie. That was just satisfying and gruesome and I don't think it can be replicated.&&I have one question that will probably influence whether or not I see this movie: since Colin Firth (Harry Hart) stole the show in the first one, is he still as badass as he was in it?&&Agreed. I couldn't believe the low RT score after actually seeing the film. It was great!&&No Elton John in part 3, please Matthew Vaughn.&&Totally agree about Kingsman, it felt like they could have waited for the 3rd movie to bring certain characters in. I just felt like they skipped the sequel and went straight for the third installment. 
The cameo had the theater roaring though and the action was spot on. &&I really liked that Eggsy's fling from the end of the last movie actually carried over into a full fledged relationship. Was a nice change of pace.

Although Matthew Vaughn has some huge balls for [killing off almost everyone in the first twenty minutes.](#spoiler)&&I just hate the fact that the sequel to every good British movie becomes American. I hated that with 28 *weeks later&&Kingsmsn hits all the notes of golden-age bond for me. I love it and I hope they make more.&&I pretty much agree. It was a worthy sequel, but it wasn't enough to surpass the first. The first had the church scene, which blew everyone away. But to be fair, if the trailer hadn't basically spoiled the entire fucking movie, it probably would have been way more shocking.&&That's actually kind of interesting, I wonder what movie got the artificial IT bump. &&This comment needs to be higher up. Is there a measure for this - R movie sneakage? That's not an insignificant number of ticket sales. Maybe they look for spuriously high ticket sales for shitty less-than-R-rated movies playing within an hour of IT?

I did this ALL THE TIME as a kid. I remember they tried cracking down for Private Parts (the Howard Stern movie), so we just asked the adult couple in front of us to buy our tickets for us and walk in with us. They also bought us one of those massive popcorn and a soda combos. I need to pay that forward one of these days.&&I feel bad about doing it :/&&We've already got a pretty constant flow of shitty paranormal/psycho murderer movies come out&&If they use good scripts I'm all for it. Was getting tired of all the James Wan stuff. &&I predict more rated R in general. ""Kingsman, Logan, Deadpool, IT... it must be because they're R!"" /movie studios&&I went to see it after reading that hilarious Reddit tldw post. No ragrets.&&Should have named it 94 Meters down. &&What about [12 feet](https://youtu.be/mhK_e0qqg8U)&&I think Warner Animation Group will release new Scooby Doo animation for 2020.

I think they also mentioned that they are going to adapt some of the Hanna-Barbera properties.&&I agree the animation was incredible, for the first half hour that is. The first 30 mins when they are in the city, looks amazing, and I would argue is the best looking sets and animation in the franchise. The standout was when Lloyd was running around the city at night, that looked spectacular. But then they leave the city for pretty much the rest of the movie, and there’s no more Lego to look at anymore. I think the jungle really would have benefited from being actually made out of Lego, rather than looking real. 

Really disappointing for me, since I love the other two, and I had the Ninjago sets when I was like 11.&&I feel like joke-a-minute movies are few and far between. That's what I love about the Lego movies, and why I enjoyed the Ninjago movie, even if I didnt give a shit about the Ninjago toy line. &&Pretty much my thoughts exactly. TSS was great, and TGC was good enough to deserve a third. I just think with all of the crazy franchises out there nowadays, Kingsman really holds its own with its great genre and fun take on action movies. Even in a worst case scenario if they all just devolve a bit into crazy action movies that don't rely on the plot and instead use their resources on over the top fights and explosions  like the Fast and Furious for example, the series has enough flavor to keep me coming back in a turn my mind off and just enjoy the fun popcorn movie kind of way. I think TSS was a lot more than that, and honestly made me feel emotions for the characters (I.e. The Mr. Pickles scene)  and I think it would be best to get a trilogy with a finale that lives up to the first. But at the least if we get some fun 60's Bond style of cheesy follow ups that are more in the lines of TGC, I'd still be lining up at the door. &&Yeah it had some troubling moments but it was a fun film and I'm hoping the 3rd one is better&&I think I read some review saying that a third is already in production. &&Mid october is only for few European countries.&&Yeah it really seems that way. I don’t think many people 25/30+ years old (who saw the other LEGO movies) have any idea what Ninjago is. I mean I see it in the stores but it was long after my time with LEGO, I just don’t think that IP resonates with the older movie goers who had interest in the first two films.&&Yeah, a lot of the critical angles baffle me. Did you *watch* the first one? These are overblown comic book spy films; nitpicking doesn’t suit the setting. It was a blast to watch, and I’ll likely see it in theatres again before it’s done its run.&&Aren't Beauty and the Beast, Fate of the Furious, and Despicable Me 3 all above Spider-man: Homecoming in worldwide gross?&&It ended up having really great legs. &&Do you mean live action summer movie? Because Beauty and the Beast, Despicable me 3 and F8, are the three highest grossing films of the year so far.&&I still get a chuckle at how people called it a flop&&From the trailers it looked like R rated Tron movie. &&Considering its 2.5+ hour length, *Blade Runner 2\^11+1* needs 33% more screens just to compete on ticket sales. I don't know how you see those stars but to me the autumn slump seems to point to some serious studio restructurings.&&Agreed - I sat IT on Saturday and was really happy with it.  My wife, who had never read the book and isn't really a fan of the typical slasher/horror flick loved it.  Even when I read the novel, it always seemed like more of a really dark adventure/fantasy kind of story with the kids banding together to fight the evil presence in their town.  Really looking forward to Chapter 2, but wondering if the adults will be able to keep up the magic established by the kids.  &&As a fan of a terrible Pierce Brosnan film called I.T. the success of IT is truly terrible. 

Am I right /u/GetFreeCash? &&While reading your comment I was like ""Holy shit, this guy worked on the movie? How cool is that?!""&&Lmao, I'm not in IT but I keep thinking the same thing. &&Not sure why this is being downvoted. Dollar figure comparisons not adjusted for inflation are worthless. Your data means nothing without the adjustment. 

I'm not sure why the only figure that actually means something, attendance, is not the measure? Attendance figures are readily available for various professional sports, and I'd wager those are the figures the sporting world looks at.&&Just adjusting for inflation still won't really tell you anything though. You also have to considered the changes in population size, how widely each film was released, how long each film ran (older films were in theaters much, much longer than any film is today).&&Part of what OP said was also that it's not correct to use the inflation rate from the original year of release when the movie was in theatres for years, if not even decades after release.&&Exactly! I see similar statements made about soccer, for instance. Every transfer season people bemoan a team breaking the transfer record, again, and argue that it is too much for a certain player. They ignore inflation, but more pertinently, ""soccer inflation"". You need to create a soccer price index to truly compare prices across years. Indeed, if you wanted to get technical you'd probably have to do something similar to truly compare box office takings across time. That is, if you are looking to assess the *relative* success of a movie and control for overall popularity of movies over the time period, for instance. &&I like it nearly as much as the first one, I just felt Poppy was a weak villian. 

But the fight scenes were stellar and Elton John is now even higher on my favorite humans list.

EDIT: Name&&I think it was great! 

I think a lot of people are disappointed because of the hype it had. The first one *most* people had zero expectations going in, while this one had a huge hypetrain.

It is hard to get that magic feeling the first one gave us because of the way it took us by surprise.

IMO the second one is very good and has so many memorable and cool scenes. I laughed through the movie and I liked it very much.

While Julianne Moore did a wonderful job I do wish her character was a bit more likeable like Valentine was. She was a bit more evil and generic, but that said she's a thrill to watch on the screen. &&> it was missing an iconic church scene like the first one had

Man, Firth *really* needed a solo action scene. I would have preferred that to the one Whiskey got in the mountains.&&The Rock would fit perfectly as a Kingsman villain. Super charismatic, and I can just imagine him describing his evil plan. Plus he'd be awesome in one of their extra stylized fight scenes.

I hope that ends up happening.&&Kingsman and Alcatraz? That I'd watch.&&The consensus on reddit is very positive for The Golden Circle. It really surprises me, as I felt like it was a major disappointment. I loved the first one, but this one was lacking so much of the charm. The character development was nonexistent. There were a lot of cliches. And the jokes mostly fell flat to me. Especially the Elton John stuff which overstayed its welcome. &&It was fun. The American stuff was weak overall, Jeff Bridges is wasted, but Pascal was a highlight. &&I wasn't a huge fan, and I loved the first one.  Not saying it was bad, it was a fun movie, but just not even close to the first one.

Too many call backs to the first one, the Statesmen were kind of weak, and the code names were a bit lame just for a gag (I think they should have gone with original 13 colony names, or founding fathers).  

And yeah, the pacing was off, and it did jump around a lot, and mostly it was a bit too much at times...and yes, I realize I'm talking about a sequel to a movie where they explode people's heads in a colorful fashion to Pomp and Circumstance.  &&I loved it. I can see/understand the concerns over pacing, but in my opinion it doesn't really drop it below a B+. I also wanted Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges to have larger roles, but Pedro Pascal is a substitute I will happily take. Hopefully this means they'll make a third movie and they'll reprise their roles and feature more prominently.&&I really *loved* the first movie and I liked the second. It had some very good parts mixed with some not so good parts. As you say the script was lacking in some parts (Merlin's exit for example).

The fighting scenes were a mixed bag for me. On one hand I loved the over the top action and they were partly really well done but I also got slightly annoyed at other times.&&I really liked it. In some ways its better than 1 is but now I'm seeing some flaws (wheres Eggsy's family?), why cant Marc Strong survive if Roxy most likely will after THAT happened? and they kinda wasted Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges. I had a real blast though. Love these films.&&Saw it last night. The fights were on par and I really enjoyed the set design. The story was weaker, and I think that comes from Polly being a very uninteresting and I didn't feel any threat from her as a villian. Pales greatly in comparrison to Samuel L Jackson

EDIT: Name Spelling&&I loved it. I'll concede it went a bit long in places, but the last hour is pretty balls to the wall. &&$110M. Would have to have incredible legs to beat Passion of the Christ ($370.7M).&&Had a great core story that didn't revolve around how much it made you jump. 

Also the plot is obviously classic King, which will always stand out against (as much as I enjoy them) The Conjuring & Insidious, James Wan type horror. &&The last movie I watched in theatre before IT was the last Harry Potter film.&&[deleted]&&I would have been pretty excited about LEGO: STAR WARS though. 

Don't know if it could do as well as Batman did, but I am willing to bet I would enjoy the hell out of it. &&Not to mention they replaced the entire voice cast for the theatrical release of this movie. &&This is why I don’t understand it being a “flop”

It hit #3 as a lesser known IP. I think that’s pretty good&&Batman still made way less than the LEGO movie, they saw this coming from miles away&&Agreed I don't think it's fair to compare Ninjago to friggin' Batman.&&My son loves Ninjago. Even he doesn't want to go see this movie. He said, and I qoute, ""It doesn't look like the show at all"". He's 3. Seems like a movie made on a wing and a prayer.&&I guess it depends on how much money they sunk into it.&&I saw it and thought it was a better movie than Lego Batman.
&&I suspect the point of the Lego movies is to move more Legos.  Ninjago was made to move more Ninjago Lego sets, not break the box office.  As long as it makes its budget back then it is a win for Lego.&&Yeah, my kids were bummed at the personality changes and my 6-year-old daughter lamented, ""They didn't even do spin-jitsu!""&&Rihanna also had her own animated movie a couple years back. And you definitely could tell it was her because they included like half of her discography, regardless of the theme of the scene or what was going on.

Almost seemed more like a vanity project than the movie trying to get a high profile voice actor. &&Titan AE is my favorite example of bad voice acting from great actors. It's a really great movie with inspired designs and an interesting premise, but the acting from Matt Damon and Drew Barrymore is really, really, really bad. The names that are big in animation should really be doing these big budget movies.

But I've never seen John DiMaggio, Richard Horvitz, Phil Lamar, Tara Strong, etc. leading in a Hollywood film. Best we get are people like Nathan Lane or Tim Curry who are established in both areas.&&My son wants to see it but I've told him it's not anyway related to the TV show.  He's kind of bummed about that.  Might wait to rent it instead.
&&They're Lego ninjas. There's been about four seasons on tv and a range of Lego sets. &&To flesh out the answers. It's Legos biggest *original* franchise by far. It's based in a weird ninja/generic asia/cyberpunk/steampunk hybrid setting. There has been hundreds of Lego sets, a TV-show that is quite popular with kids (and is surprisingly decent for us parents) that has had 7 seasons. Plus a companion magazine, spin-off toys, mobile games etc.

&&I saw a few billboards, plenty of bus benches. Zero trailers, zero video ads of any kind. &&I was having dinner with my 12 year old cousin who's a big lego fan. I asked him if he was excited to watch the new Lego movie and he's like ""it already came out?"" Weird because I've seen a ton of ads for it and I'm not even in their target audience. &&> I didn't even see a single trailer for it.

Ya, only reason I knew about it was a McDonald's happy meal toy yesterday... which my kid loves but she can't read so she has no idea it's for a lego movie.&&> I didn't even see a single trailer for it. 

There was one before Lego: Batman.&&I saw a couple of ads on YouTube but that's really it&&This is the first I've heard someone say the LEGO Batman movie had poor animation. It looked good to me. Why do you say that?&&Same here, my son and daughter love Ninjago, that said, we only watch it on Netflix and don't watch actual television so we don't get inundated by ads... But still, we had no clue, whereas we knew about Lego Batman, Lego movie, trolls, pets etc... All the  major movies still managed to advertised well enough to reach people like us... Ninjago did not apparently.&&Take your kid to see it for sure. I enjoyed it and I'm just a 27 year old Lego fan. It's not quite as good as The Lego Movie but I think I liked it more than Lego Batman. &&Well, it opened at $21m whereas LEGO Batman opened to $53m. If we extrapolate that ratio to the worldwide total, it would only make $123 million. Assuming it cost the same to make as Lego Batman ($80m), that means it would lose money for WB. I don’t think it’s run will be quite that bad, and there’s a chance WB reduced the budget for this one. But this is definitely bad news for the Lego franchise in general. 
&&I liked it a lot! Good jokes, moved fast, decent characterization.

Weird that they kept all the same characters from the show but changed the voice actors, back story, plot and personalities of everyone.

Still good as its own thing.&&I thought its big weakness was a serious lack of character development. Aside from lloyd and garmadon you learn literally nothing about the other characters. Also the first 20 minutes or so was just shit.&&FML?&&I think the studio that made it also forgot it existed.&&It's a 2016 movie with a rerelease isn't it?&&Oh yeah, I saw the Funhaus review too. The movie sounds amazingly dumb.&&That's the movie with the bees right? &&Ever since that Half In the Bag ep, I can't *not* think of that title every time I see the movie mentioned. &&Exorcist: Tokyo Drift &&Exorcist 2: Electric BOO-galoo.&&Sinesyis?&&Exorcist 2: Demonic  Boogaloo&&I think the Exorcist might also include the profits it made in rerelease.&&But it also only made like 126 million on its initial theater run. Remasters and re-releases are why that number is so high. &&[deleted]&&I can give you about tree-fiddy&&Just curious-- have you ever considered writing for a paper? I am sure that you could find a job somewhere, as your data is concise enough to keep you interested while also being very informative!&&set up a patreon &&We gotta hear you on a Blank Check ep&&It’s definitely not as good because it’s hard to top a film that was so surprising for its quality. But if you liked the 1st one, this is a decent sequel. I feel it could have gone through another round or two of script editing and/or character development, but it was enjoyable.&&I had the same problem with John Wick 2, and there's definitely some sequelitis with both, but I enjoyed Kingsman 2 for what it's worth and I could honestly get 5 more of these movies and never complain.&&FWIW, I don't recall being as hyped for a movie as Kingsman 2, in a very very long time. This is the first time I went to a theatre to watch a movie since Revenant. I sincerely think that the church scene is still the best directed fight scenes in the last decade.( Very happy to hear other options for this). 

It isn't as good as the first one, but it is about 80% there in my opinion, which to me still presented me with a great watch and walking away pretty content with the movie itself. I will watch it again when it comes to TV. The various action scenes are still a par above most movies you will watch in 2017. 


&&I seem to be in the minority here, but I liked the sequel better than the first one. I thought the story was better and had a little more depth. It had a solid plot twist or two in it to boot, but still struck me as a movie that knew what it was and didn't try to be more than that.

Just my two cents. I think you'll enjoy it if you liked the first one!&&I had a similar experience with the first movie. Was reluctant to go but my friend really wanted to so I finally caved and was blown away. If you have high expectations you will probably be disappointed. But if you enjoy the personality of the first one it really carries over. It's one where I wasn't sitting there going this isn't as good as the first one, I was just enjoying what was going on. &&The advertising for it was straight garbage.

I had no interest in it based on the ads, but absolutely loved the actual movie.&&Amazing sleeper (at least for me). Figured I'd give it a try when it came to Netflix and I absolutely loved it. 

So bizarre how the marketing did 0 to relay what the film was about. &&If the plot was slightly better Man from UNCLE would've went down as one of the very best spy films ever IMO. Everything else about it was fantastic, especially the cinematography and cast.&&It had terrible marketing, I watched it an absolutely loved it.&&i liked pretty much everything about UNCLE. I thought the cast and the script was really great. I really wish it did well enough to start a series. &&The third film is probably going to having Statesmen/Kingsmen joining forces with the Canadian analogs, which are likely going to be themed around Maple Syrup or Lumberjacks.&&My friend and I were thinking something along a guy wanting to solve the worlds financial crisis by stealing all the worlds money and trying to control it. It'd make for a hilarious heist plot. We also saw rumors that Vaughn was looking at The Rock for the villain of the third, so that's right up his alley. &&The reviewer for the AV Club seems to think this is a nefarious plot to lead us all into Torydom. For what it's worth, I don't read it that way. I think it's just Vaughan's rather tactless attempt to give the villains some degree of ""grey"" in terms of what they do. Sure, their goals are noble, but their methods are deplorable. That being said, I thought the premise here was the height of silliness, mostly because Julianne Moore's character motivation was really under-developed. She's mad because no one takes the [biggest drug lord in the world seriously because she's not on Fortune](#spoiler). It just doesn't add up in the same way that Samuel L. Jackson's [character chose mass genocide because of the ills of overpopulation because he was an uber-rational nerdling](#spoiler). &&If they want to make 70 Kingsman movies I'm in.  I don't care what they're about.  Their universe is just really fun to watch.&&My wife and I had just seen Logan Lucky the week prior and that song had some pretty big parts in the movie.  And it being just before the intro to Tequila was a really cool parallel.&&It bothers me that they picked a song about West Virginia for scenes that take place entirely in Kentucky. &&Am i the only person who thinks it's odd that 3 major releases this year featured that song in some significant capacity?&&Fuck it. I'd watch the shit out of that. &&And also, we'll get the Chinese version of the Kingsmen.&&Kingsman: The Royal Hangover&&Yeah, they're better off not trying to one-up the church scene. Trying out new ideas without carrying about them being better then each other will probably give them greater success.&&the church scene was easily the best fight scene in recent memory. the [diner scene with eggsy and harry against oberyn](#spoiler) in the new one was also pretty damn good too&&I think it's the rapid changes between regular speed and slow motion that messes with people in the fight scenes. It's nice to be able to see the action and all, but I think it's a bit of an overcompensation for the copious amounts of films that are all fast-cut action scenes.&&Plus Freebird.&&Answering this question would be a huge spoiler, but one thing I can say is that there are *other* characters who sort of live up to Harry's ""holy shit that guy can do *that*?"" legacy from the first one. :)&&I think it's a lot of fun while you're watching it, but it doesn't really hold up if you look closer. Also, I was really disappointed with how they handled Colin Firth, he shouldn't have been brought back in the first place IMO. He only feels like the same character from the first movie in one scene, otherwise I thought he was pretty boring. &&Drink every time Elton John says ""Fuck You"".

Die.&&Elton stole the show, he was amazing. But yeah, to use him again would be a mistake.&&I can see him having a cameo at least&&Agreed. He was great in one movie, but two would overdo it. It’d cheapen it out.&&It doesn't, really. Trust me. The Statesmen are a feature, not a focus.&&Haha we've all done it, I remember going to see beer fest in theaters like that!

Edit: oh my god it came out 11 years ago... &&Saw 8 lol&&James Wan is a good horror filmmaker but it's all a little cookie-cutter&&I was getting tired of all the quirky superhero stuff. &&After so many years of being force-fed PG-13, I'll take what I can get. &&Link? &&I don't regret seeing it either. It was weird. Confusing. Interesting. Dark. that ""baby scene"" was over the top, but when it first started getting dark, I was pretty engrossed.&&Me too.  And I thought it was pretty well done.  I like films that go for the weird.  I especially liked the way the party scenes built up so fluidly. &&I Still Know What You Did Last 48 Meters Down&&Such a daft premise!  
It's like nobody involved in the film has ever been to a swimming pool, and seen the overflow systems in place.&&I'm hopeful for those. I'm just talking about the lego movies in general.&&God, please no. I won't be able to handle another CGI Scooby monstrosity. &&> I had the Ninjago sets when I was like 11.

Just as a matter of pedantry, the late 1990s era Ninja sets aren't ""Ninjago"", they were just branded as ""Ninja"". 

edit: Unless you're saying your 16 now and I've inadvertently aged myself. &&I think it's the perfect movie to watch with a couple of guys while drinking copious amounts of beer and/or whisky.&&> some troubling moments

Shhhhhhh. What happens in Glasto stays in Glasto&&I really enjoyed it, but from all the ads I was lead to believe Channing Tatum would've been a bigger role than he was. I was hoping for a cowboy-esque church scene. &&True.

If they did a Bionicle movie, however...&&Overall I liked it and I hope to see a stronger third movie as well. But there were things that could've been improved without having to change the style of the movie.

Specifically:

* Harry's recovery felt a bit off. I liked that he wasn't 100% back right away, but even at the end he still felt off a bit, as a character;

* The fact that there wasn't any sort of exposition on the fact that Ginger Ale is a good field agent;

* No explanation for why Merlin was in the field. Or why he didn't just wait for Eggsy and Harry to deactivate the minefield. It's not like it was planned for him to take the first 7-8 guys down with him;

* Whiskey's betrayal was very poorly handled. It would've helped if we knew earlier his background story. As such it felt contrived.

All of these could've been handled with little effort and that could've made the film better without ruining the setting at all. &&That's how I look at it. I didn't try to rationally explain some of the dumber stuff because I know the movie is like a parody/over-the-top version of Bond. That's why I love it so much. I want it to be ridiculous. It's like how Saints Row was a crazy version of GTA. I guess some people don't like that and I understand, but I can't believe the reviews it and the first movie got! &&I think he meant highest grossing superhero film&&Regular legs, it just has 6 more than the other movies.&&China &&Much like its star.&&Pierce Brosnan's IT is so bad that was the only time I changed the Sunday ""best film"" thread to be a ""worst film"" thread. I was drained of all faith in humanity.&&Some countries like South Korea go by admissions for reporting&&Attendance would be great. Ticket sales (actual number) would be a far better metric.&&Because attendance can be impacted by inflation as well. If movie tickets are cheap compared to other forms of entertainment in their era, then they might enjoy higher attendance regardless of quality. There's something to be said for the cash investment people made in seeing the movie, which is why a lot of people prefer raw sales or sales adjusted for inflation.&&I think the way she died made her a weak villain, not necessarily that she was horribly written in my opinion. 

And yes, Elton John was amazing throughout the movie. Had no clue he'd be playing himself but I'm glad he did.&&I remember someone once suggesting he'd make a good Lex Luther, and since then I haven't been able to get the image out of my head. &&My friend and I were trying to hammer down why we didn't like it. And it seemed to come down to 2 things. 

1) I didn't feel like a cohesive movie. It felt like a lot of fun scenes they wrote stringed together. Take Angel for example. His entire point is to show how evil the villain is and that's it. Fun scenes but made little sense story wise. He just shows up kills someone then dies. And that's it.  Same with Merlin's death, an awesome scene with him singing and all that but then it felt totally unnecessary and it took out like 5 guards which seemed totally unnecessary when they wipe through 15 a minute later.  

2) lack of character depth and development. To me this was really shown with Whiskey, he is this awesome badass then his major twist is explained in about 20 seconds of screen time and barely justified IMO. Then look at Ginger ale, could have done so much more with her. There was hints at some issues between her and whiskey (him vetoing her spot in the statesmen) but that's all we hear about her. Same with Champ and the president. You have these great charecters with awesome actors and you just get nothing from them.  I'm not saying they should all have flushed out back stories but give one of them some exposition or something. There just felt like there was no charecters arcs besides Egsy pissing off his girlfriend and Harry returning to normal both of which felt kinda half done. 

Also the nanobot cop out for Harry was annoying. Kinda wanted a better explanation for that.  &&Yeah they could have booted Elton John after a few minutes and I would have been ok. 

Whiskey felt paper thin, which is a shame cause I love Pedro Pascal and his whip was badass (he should have came back for the third film) 

But I loved that Eggsy and Princess Tilde stayed together. That was a great part for me and I hope her character continues expanding. The death of Roxy and Merlin were huge for me. Mark Strong has been such a fantastic part of this series and he will be hard to lose. 

But I'm holding out hope that the third film could be the best one yet. With Tatum involved and then potentially bringing the Rock in as the villain. &&My wife said Pascal is quickly becoming her favorite actor. Obviously Oberyn, we finished 3 seasons of Narcos, now Whiskey. Pleasantly surprised because from trailers we thought Tatum would be the main Statesman.&&The Statesmen being named after liquor is like the Kingsmen's handles being ""Brogue"", ""Inseam"" and ""Bespoke"", or something.&&Man, I can't imagine seeing Passion of The Christ in theatres. Anyone here see it when it came out? What were audience reactions?&&Agreed, was ninjago even in the original movie? Not much reason to see that movie since I have no inherent interest in ninjago.&&Lego Batman also had some mildly ""eh, I liked Lego Movie better"" reviews which can hurt a third movie.

In contrast, Lego Batman was following the freaking *Oscar nominated* Lego Movie.&&Yes I think you have a great point here. We are big Lego fans in our house and Ninjago is just not on the radar at all. 

Neither of my 2 boys are into it - and none of the circle of their friends are either. 

So if we view Ninjago as a “niche” amongst Lego fans - kids and adults alike - it stands to reason that the Ninjago movie would make a smaller pile of money than The Lego Movie (Which I love) and The Lego Batman Movie (Which I also love). 

Lego did release a pretty cool looking set as a movie tie in however. Look at [this beast](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/NINJAGO-City-70620)!! Pricey however. &&Star Wars is Disney now, no chance Warner brothers gets the Ip for a movie.&&Box office success is revenue to budget. If it's budgeted like the other movies, that means the studio expects it to perform like the other movies. &&The money the movie makes don't mater that much if they just pass the budget pretty much. It is a LEGO movie, they make the real money with a LOT of toys, went to buy a gift for my nephew last friday and there were shelves of new Ninjago toys.

Edit: I can't write for shit.&&[deleted]&&$70 million animating budget.&&[deleted]&&Wait what? I was gonna take my six year old to see it, but I had assumed it would just be a big-budget two hour episode of the show. If it's a different incarnation or whatever there's no way we're going. &&I took my kids to see it. They liked it, but I said the same thing: ""They didn't even do spin-jitsu!""

My kids were both impressed and embarrassed that I knew what that was.&&They went backwards a bit with the plot, but it is very related. Lloyd Garmadon is still green ninja and Lord Garmadon is his evil dad. On the show, father and son reconciled a while ago, but the movie redoes that whole bit with a different story. It's still totally recognizable and my kids enjoyed it.&&*7 seasons&&Well then isn't a Lego Ninjago movie a bit redundant? Definitely not in keeping with the Lego Cinematic Universe™©® up until this point&&There were tons of trailers, but only on very specific ""Family Time slots"" Food Network, Travel Channel, and TBS ran a lot of ads, especially during Big Bang Theory and the various ""Bizarre Eats"" cycles.

the big thing was the ads were all over children and family programming and not the more later or more adult shows. I never saw one preview during Preacher and it was utterly devoid on late night TV or the El Rey network.&&you still see ads?&&In TLM every effect was animated using rendered LEGO bricks.  In TLBM, a substantial amount of standard CGI was used.

It looked more like a more polished version of one of the low-end LEGO shorts or one of the DVD movies they did than the effects in TLM.
&&I definitely liked it more than Lego Batman. Most of the characters in Lego Batman felt off to me. &&From what I've heard, the respective TV show is pretty popular. I think they could've had stronger marketing if they capitalized on that instead of changing everything.

Replacing the voice actors is especially baffling - could you imagine watching the SpongeBob movie without the voice of SpongeBob?&&My take is that it's not a continuation of the series, but rather the kid from the first LEGO movie got a bunch of new Ninjago sets and is imagining what he'd do with them.&&[deleted]&&Fantasy Movie League.&&You guessed it!&&The Funhaus guys can be such movie snobs that whenever they shit on a movie that looks semi-entertaining to me I know I'll probably like it. The tell I look for in a review from them is that somewhere in the middle of eviscerating the movie one will say ""It wasn't *that* bad,"" or something along those lines and I'm like, ""Oh, okay, they liked it for the most part but now they are trashing it because they love over-analyzing and trashing movies more than watching them.""

Specifically if Bruce or sometimes Lawrence has a problem with plot or continuity I'm almost positive, even without having seen the movie, that they just missed something because they were talking to each other, were drunk, or otherwise weren't paying attention.

Edit: When I call them movie snobs I mean it with love. They are intensely critical of all things and movies are just one of them. They love bad movies and good movies but they can certainly be snobby when it comes to movies and their deconstructive (and constructive) criticism of them. That's not to say they would ever try to keep others from enjoying them.&&OH NO NOT THE BEES&&Episode III: Revenge of the Exorcist&&Linda Blair doing donuts while her head stays in place.&&Exorcist: Full Throttle&&2 Fast 2 Exorcist&&I...

I managed to not be the same thing over again but kept that clean clear camera work and crisp action. What exactly do you think made it a weakened movie for you?&&Have to say, as far as sequels go, Kingsman 2 definitely did better than John Wick 2. Just my opinion, but the basis for John Wick 2 was so thin, they might as well have broken the fourth wall and said ""...we just want to make a trilogy"".
&&I 100% agree with your assessment of it.  It's not the big surprise hit that the first one was, but it's still a hell of a lot of fun.  ""80% there"" is spot-on.&&Same. I didn't want to go see it. then when HBO had it, I watched it, cuz, why not? ... and I really enjoyed it. I didn't even know Alicia Vikander was in it. I'll watch anything she's in. &&Nail on the head. My roommate brought it home one day as a redbox rental. I had chosen the last movie so I didn't put up a fight even though i thought i was going to hate it. Turns out we both loved it and couldn't believe we had put it off for so long. &&God my favorite part from that movie was when they were infiltrating that water plant or whatever it was to get something really important, and they kept trying to one-up each other and everything lmao&&Agreed. There wasn't enough motivation for the characters in the movie. Halfway through the movie and I was like ""What are the the supposed to do?"".&&I think it also really hurt it to open the same year as MI:5. I loved UNCLE when I saw (a great period-piece spy filM) it but MI:5 was the superior film and it drew a lot of attention away from a very competent retro spy film.&&""The Nicemen""&&Australia.

Or is it some kind of conspiracy?! &&[as sung by a Scotsman in Cambodia](#spoiler)&&That's the joke though. They're not Americans so they've just latched on to the most familiar ""country"" iconography they know &&Logan Lucky spoilers!

I thought that was so surreal and oft-putting, especially because the role the exact same song played in Logan Lucky, and it actually being about W. Virginia in that film. I just kept thinking during the scenes in kingsmen, hardcore cultural dissonance in comparison. I actually sang along with the girl in Logan Lucky, it was so moving during the pageant scene.&&It's also a song about Country Roads, which Kentucky has.&&I believe I saw in another thread it's actually 6 releases this year.&&The Chinaman&&It also gets choppy, like there's frames missing.  That really stood out for me during the final fight.  It was slow mo, yet choppy.&&I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum. I really like the way they handled Firth's resurrection and the scene where [Eggsy snaps him out of his amnesia by threatening to shoot the dog like Harry had to ""shoot"" Mr. Pickle was, albeit a little predictable, was fantastic!](#spoiler).&&I love the way he says ""Fffffuck You!"" &&He said it like 3, maybe 4 times&&10/10 how they used the “save the world” joke from the first one with him.&&What was funny for me was discussing it with my girlfriend after seeing it, and she said she really liked Elton John's cameo. And then I said it was basically an actual role in the film. Because he's actually  plot relevant. Not just Stan Lee saying excelsior or something. &&Fuck you.&&I did that to Super Troopers. how do you think I feel?&&I really enjoy his movies, and it was a breath of fresh air after the paranormal activity trend. I just think the genre is ready for something fresh. &&I was getting tired of all these motherfuckin' snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

I'd tell you it was worth the expense. I'm not sure I liked the movie but I'm glad I watched it. Also with everyone talking about who God and Mother Earth are I haven't seen anyone mention that the house is clearly earth itself. It's not like a big thing just I haven't seen that anywhere.&&They need to cast a dog AIRBUD style &&I thought it was pretty good, all things considered. There's no way a real dog could act as animated as Scooby.&&No. The newer stuff is Ninjago. And I’m 17&&Not to mention that they criminally underutilized OSCAR WINNERS Halle and The Dude. 

They really wasted Bridges, that was the biggest let down for me.  Too much Elton John, not enough Jeff or Halle

&&All of these sound like things that I wouldn’t be surprised to hear were cut for run time. And I’d also add the sequence between the explosions and Statesman reveal to drill in the alone-ness. They killed Roxy, JB and the friend, basically taking out each part of Eggsy’s life (work, friend, family), but it got glossed over with a “keep it bottled up”, then a “hit the bottle” joke. They were supposed to hit rock bottom alone, that would have leant the “torture” scene and Harry’s reveal so much more weight. As it was, it just seemed to be “another day at the office for the super spy”. &&With Whiskey, if we had known his intentions, then the mystery would have been lost. Knowing everything straight away doesn't make things automatically better.

Harry was shot in the eye. Why shouldn't he be ""off?"" 

How would they know you could deactivate the minefield?&&Yeah, Whiskey's betrayal felt very much like a Deus Ex Whiskey plot device. Like, I understand that the movie is full of ""because Elton john"" moments, but it just felt like lazy writing.

Also, the weird sex scene was super uncomfortable. Everyone in my theatre was visibly uncomfortable and thinking ""why is this necessary?"" &&Not even a parody, more like a pastiche. They celebrate the light-hearted spy film. &&Ahh that would make more sense.&&At this point the Fast and Furious movies are basically superhero films haha.&&Personally, I like Wonder Woman's legs more.&&Well, we just need to pair up Regular Legs with Baby Legs, and they'd make an unstoppable buddy cop duo.&&It would be pretty weird if Lex looked like he could genuinely beat the shit out of Superman.&&Man, Nanobots always feel like a huge cop out. I understand that the films are very ridiculous. Very over the top and not meant to be taken too seriously. But that doesn't mean they get a free pass to have lazy writing. &&I did love that they stayed together. Huge plus. Although the wedding at the end with everyone all there was really lame. 

Roxy dieing was very big for me, but Merlins death felt so incredibly unnecessary. Like just get a rock. Why even bring a minesweeper if you are just going to step on one anyway?

Tatum leaving through most of the film was pretty sad too, I was looking forward to him being a big part. &&Fuckin' Merlin. I kept expecting him to not blow up because the baddies forgot to reset the mines; Poppy kept harping on that point so I figured, okay, they've got to do something clever with it right? But no, he just blows up. Such a shame. Almost as bad as losing JB!&&Tatum was hardly in the film! I mean, given all the attention he got in the trailers I expected a bigger role from him&&Tatum had to cut back on his involvement for some other movie, that's why he was removed from the action (didn't see the movie, read it somewhere) and they rewrote his scenes for Pascal.&&And Tequila is Mexican and Champagne is French, I was expecting something more Murican, I mean that was kind of their shtick.  

It just seemed far less well thought out organization, and more of a joke and easy out to fix The Kingsmen.  ""everything from the intro is magically fixed, we have money, resources, and Colin Firth is okay, and here's a reason to reenact a bar fight...please ignore us the rest of the movie"".  &&I saw it. Crazy. Theater was so full they overbooked the theater and people were sitting in the aisles. It was weird at the time to be like ""wow this really moved a lot of people...i think I hated it."" 

Thankfully South Park captured that well. &&Yes, one guy appeared for 2 seconds, in the Cuckoo land scene that featured many other cameos. So nothing significant.&&Nah, Ninjago is its own series on Cartoon Network and had some TV movies, but that's about it &&[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOF4Jam_JKY) was a bonus scene on the original Lego Movie blu-ray.&&Wonder Woman managed to follow the Oscar winning movie Suicide Squad.&&I dont think it even got a nomination.  &&Lego movie didn’t win an Oscar though.....&&It wouldn't be the first time that WB and Disney have worked together though, if you count the TV front.&&I was also going to argue that it didn't seem like a flop based on the fact that this isn't really their leading IP... but I was shocked to see how much budget they gave the Ninjago movie.  That was a rather optimistic investment.&&Pretty much this.  Being number three doesn't mean anything.  Having your revenue outpace your expenses matters.&&>shelfes

Sean Connery takes those with his smartphone.&&They could start selling some kind of toys related to the movie. &&You could buy about a dozen of those 7500-piece Millennium Falcon sets with that money.&&Think of it like an alternative timeline where they fight using giant robots/mechs but [then learn to fight using their elements later on without the mechs which is basically spin-jitsu. ](#spoiler)&&In LEGO Movie fashion, it pokes fun at the source material rather than try to be faithful to it. It is a comedy-heavy story with Ninjago characters, but not the same tone or continuity that is expected from the show.
That said, I really enjoyed it, and so did my eight year-old who was very into the show a couple years ago.&&Ive only seen the ones on Netflix, wow that's a lot. &&I'm guessing YouTube ads, which would also be specifically targeted.&&Lego Ninjago is very similar. The water is actual water (not Lego bricks pretending to be water), the plants are actual plants, etc. Vast swathes of the world building that isn't square buildings are just your standard CGI and not Lego bricks.

I haven't been able to find any info on the movie's overall budget, but I assume that fact plus there being no highly paid actors in it would've helped them significantly keep their budget down. &&Patrick: Spongebob, what happened?

Spongebob(As portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson:) THAT BITCH ASS MUTHAFUCKA CHEATED&&That explains a lot. You can do to that with something as random as the Lego movie but people young and old binge watch the Ninjago series.&&Yes, at the very beginning Jackie Chan (as the narrator, not as Master Wu) says something like ""forget everything you know about Ninjago"".  It seemed to me like they were re-booting the series.&&> It almost felt like they were trying too hard to stick to the lego movie 'jokey' formula, that they didn't let Ninjago be it's own thing.

unlike TLM, some of the jokes and references were *too* quick - they didn't have any time to set in (and thus have you ""get it"") before they moved on.  

beyond the slightly-better-than-ok writing, the decisions to completely replace the voice actors, rework the whole canon backstory, and switch to TLM-style animation instead of keeping the CGI of the Ninjago series were questionable at best, and a dearth of effective marketing meant that TLNM didn't hold much of a chance at success.&&The fuck?&&Now *that* movie was terrible. The bees scene isn't even in the final cut. The wicker man for anyone who doesn't know what he's referencing&&ITS OVER, SATAN! THE LORD HAS THE HIGH GROUND!&&Exorsith*&&Exorcist and Knuckles&&The Fate of The Exorcist.&&Episode V: The Exorcist Strikes Back!&&I would watch this.&&Sexorcist&&In space&&Considering how Disney practically owns most of the blockbusters nowadays anyway, that might not be such a stretch. Maybe you should hit them up?&&/u/mi-16evil confirmed Loch-Ness Monster&&Where are you Guam? &&AV Club and io9 are always looking for movie people&&Fuck, MAKE a paper.

Just keep doing what you're doing now, but brand it a little, get some ad revenue and hide ads for patreon subscribers (or just patreon if filtering ads is tricky). &&I'm also on board with this assessment.  The first one was unexpected. It also had a legitimate and serious beginning. This second one was as cagey to start as the first one was at the end.  I still enjoyed my time in the theater though.&&Alicia Vikander? Say no more &&Even Tulip Fever?&&I loved the bit where Henry Cavill was watching Armie Hammer drive a boat around while being shot at, and Cavill was sitting in a truck snacking on someone's lunch instead of helping.&&What *are* the the supposed to do?&&""Manners maketh da man, eh""&&It'd be a total missed opportunity for the Canadian versions to not be operating covertly out of a hockey rink. &&""The Moosemen"" (Source: Movie Fights)
&&> And the plot will doubtless resolve around universal healthcare, ~~but when you go in, they take a sample of your DNA for mind control or something.~~

I feel like if they're going to go with the universal healthcare angle the villain would be going with eugenics on an aggressively executed massive scale to eliminate the need for healthcare. Probably through killing everyone with certain genetic markers or a series of fertility clinics that are actually just implanting slightly altered clones of some 'perfect human'.&&Did a little digging and found this.  Could be that it was just a coincidence or it could be one of the ones doing the approvals saw a chance to parallel the two characters by Tatum....or maybe was a Tatum fan.  Lots of speculation, but its cool either way.  I enjoyed the usage in both movies.

>Abrams also attributed the uptick to the estate’s partnership with Kobalt (they were brought on in 2014, replacing BMG, and also represent artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and the Red Hot Chili Peppers), in addition to making licensing a priority with their new team. To secure the rights to a Denver song, Abrams explained, the filmmakers must submit scene briefs. If they aren’t clear enough as to how the music will be used and further questions don’t clear the matter up, Denver’s children and their business managers are consulted as well. What’s most important, said Abrams, is that they remain in line with Denver’s ideals: He’s remembered as a philanthropist and humanitarian as much as he is a musician, and much of the content on his official web page is devoted to his messages of peace and compassion.

&&They use it in Alien: Covenant, which doesn't even take place on Earth.&&Way more than that. He said it more than 4 times in the glass cell alone&&The Golden Circle had so many good, subtle references to the first one. And that was by far my favorite &&Best line in the movie for me. I was crying laughing, but had to connect the dots for my gf to understand&&GET OUT OF MY FUCKING ROOM&&I agree, I just feel like he sort of makes the same horror film over and over again - like his style is *so* recognisable these days it's almost got a bit bland for me or something?

I think if he made like 3 or 4 horror films he'd be like a god-tier horror filmmaker&&Funny you mention that, as it was a super unique movie imo.

Doubt something as stupid as that had been so successful since the 80s&&I don't think the movie can live up to what I just read.&&Thanks! I just saw it yesterday&&Jesus it seems simple I just never thought of it. 

But it makes perfect sense. &&Has anyone pinned down who Kristen Wiig is? Gabriel? Lucifer? &&> Not sure I liked the movie, but glad I watched it


You just summed up every  aronofsky movie.&&lmao see my edit. Turns out the theme is a little longer running than I thought it was. &&Ginger Ale got as much time as her character called for, it's Champagne and Tequila that really went to waste.&&Honestly, there wasn't enough Tatum either.  He was funny in what little doses we got.&&There's plenty of middle ground between ""explicit intentions"" and ""absolutely zero indication of being evil""&&Don't know where you watched it but everyone where I watched it (UK) was absolutely shitting themselves laughing at it.&&Wait what weird sex scene? &&The last movie ended with anal sex what were you expecting &&There was a girl that couldn't have been older than 8 at the end of my row lol&&Look at Comic Lex, he's usually pretty stacked, and then dons an exosuit on top of that. 

I like the idea that Lex is this pinnacle of humanity, a billionaire genius with an Olympic build. But none of that matters in comparison to Superman, and that really pisses him off.&&It's about as weird as no one asking meek, mild-mannered Clark Kent why he has the biggest chest in Metropolis.&&I had high hopes for Channing too! But I think he'll be great when they give him some moments to shine in the next film. Channing is hilarious when given the chance. 

And you're absolutely right about Merlin. His death was stupid and unnecessary on anyway. He could have just stayed behind on the plane or any number of things. His character still had so much left to offer and we hardly knew anything about him. He didn't even have a character build up moment before we destroyed him. 

Let alone, with Halle Berry getting promoted to the field. Now neither the kings man or the statesmen have an intelligence gatherer. 

I sure hope they don't relegate Channing to Merlin's position. 

And that wedding was way to out of the blue. One day they are in a fight and the next  it's wedding time? That could have been movie 3 material for sure. Just bringing Harry back could have been this films only major emotional tie. Eggsy and Tilde's wedding was not needed yet. 

&&He comes in, beats 2 supposedly amazing super agents by himself and then does a silly dance and gets frozen.&&Interesting... I like Tatum, too, but I think if that's why Pascal got the increase, it worked out for the better.&&I think the bigger draw is that its a pretty successful TV show, but it's *nothing* like the movie. Even in the trailer for the movie it felt like an entirely different property. &&Well.. to be fair it probably has more share of lego space than even Star Wars at Toys R Us.  Regardless, I saw it on the weekend with my kids and wasn't that impressed.  They basically made Garmadon's humour the same feel as they did for Batman and sort of slapped it together without any character development as if you should know what's happening.  It was definitely targeting a niche market.&&how the hell did Suicide Squad win an Oscar?&&Yeah, by taking $820m at the box office.

Never hurts if your last movie was a hit. It's not so good if you're following a disappointing sequel.&&It didn't, which remains the biggest snub in recent memory I can think of.&&Everything Is Awesome was nominated for best original song, I think.&&It won the Oscars of *my heart*&&Ah, true.&&They have had LEGO Star Wars specials air on Disney XD before. After Rebels sometimes.&&Thanks, I got confused with that one.&&you mean Sean Connery takesh thoshe with hish shmartphone&&/r/shubreddit&&Or about 70k Iphone Xs&&Only if you bought the current version. 

If you tried to buy one of the collectible previous-generation ones, that would get you 3 and a half.&&Are you joking or did the actually just make a LEGO version of the Power Ranger movie?&&Can confirm, saw a few ads on YT.&&Given some of the other things I've heard about the movie, i don't mind the real water and plants as much in this one.  Disappointing if the CGI extends to buildings and constructs that should be LEGO.

Still will take my son to it.  Just hoping they don't make the same mistakes with The LEGO Sequel.&&Spongebob(As portrayed by Patrick Stewart): ""You like Krabby Patties, don't you Squidward!""&&Like fantasy football but you pick films in a cinema based on how much money you think they'll take.

I especially love it how you NEVER see it from Armie's perspective, all just brief glances from Cavill as he noms on a fresh sandwich and a good glass of wine. &&the music in this sequence is fucking exceptional. &&Lmao and he's messing with the radio too 😂😂&&This is gold, i imagined Kingsman in south park & fell to my knees historically laughing&&""The Linesmen""&&Lordy I hope so. &&Oh God please. His death felt so unnecessary and he is so cool. &&That would be the best thing ever&&I think the big problem is how much his style is just copied by others. It's something that happens in every genre, but it's just more pronounced in horror because they quick and cheap to make (and oh-so-very easy to mess up). There's nothing inherently wrong with say, found footage horror movies, but it's when every horror movie afterwards is a found footage movie regardless of how much sense it makes is when people start having an issue with it. James Wan is a good horror director, but when everyone copies his style it get really bland really fast.&&Oh it's just as weird as the description &&[Mother Nature is constantly trying to pick up after God's new guests who keep wrecking earth.

Edit: She's also the first and only person interested in publicizing His second work, and from what I recall the only person who suggests ""finishing off"" Mother. Maybe she represents some Evangelical branch of Christianity? Especially one concerned with censoring competing faiths that hold up Mother as an equal to Him?

Saw it once a few hours ago, so I might be missing something in the timing or phrasing that would clarify. I need a second viewing, I don't think there was a single wasted word in the film.&&Watching in Southern California and it was the same here.&&It's an R rated movie. &&Farmboy strength, and you can disguise a lot of your build with the right clothing and posture&&Dude doesn't skip chest days.&&True. The wedding could have been a nice end to a trilogy. To me it felt like they put that in as a half assed character development moment for Eggsy. At the start he is on the fence about marriage and at the end he gets married. But it's really really weak. &&Then wakes up and puts on a suit&&It is.  My pre schooler watches the show and they've got entirely different voice actors and an entirely different continuity for the film.  The show is also pretty serious (at least for a cartoon based on Legos) whereas the movie appears to be going for the same humor as the previous Lego films.

I'm kind of fascinated by why they went the route they did, but am not surprised it tanked.&&My son has been a ninjago fan most of his life. His grandmother makes a hobby of getting him every. Single. Lego Set. 

Every. Year.

He was pretty annoyed by the trailers for the movie and wasn't that enthused to see it.

We may still see it this weekend, but if the marketing muffled it for their freaking core fans, I'm not surprised it's taking it on the chin.&&The movie feels almost like a reboot that just skipped all of Season 1.&&Yep. My son loves the series and I took him to see the movie. He was disappointed because it wasn't a Ninjago movie. It was a Lego movie with Ninjago characters. And most of the main characters were barely more than cameos. He has no interest in seeing it again. &&Ive watched the first 3 seasons of ninjago. Used to run on school mornings. It's really good. I thought the movie was great too. Its not as good as batman or lego movie but its definitely a fun movie to watch.&&My son has been bonkers for the Lego Ninjago movie to come out. The tv series was his favorite for a long time and he was literally counting down the days. I took him to it yesterday and he was clearly incredibly dissapinted because every aspect that made the show such a success for him was completely gone.

Everyone in lego Ninjago was an asshole just like in Lego Batman and the Lego movie. Garmadon was literally Batman from the previous film and they relied on nonsense to keep audiences watching. I really with they would have diverted from their formula, at least a little for this one, especially because it's supposed to be based off of the tv show, unlike Batman which had heavy ties to the first movie.
&&[deleted]&&It probably was the most watched movie in the make-up category.&&The Lego Movie was watched many times in my house. Many many times. We love it. &&Yeah pretty much. &&I took my 8 year old daughter last weekend.  I liked it, but not as much as TLBM and certainly not TLM.  She isn't really a fan of Batman or Ninjago and she liked it better than TLBM.  So go figure. It does have a similar father is the villain theme that the original had.  Just doesn't resonate as strong.&&Honestly that sounds kinda neat. Any recommendations where one might get in on the action?&&I HATE YOU&&[deleted]&&Go give Necro's album. The sexorcist a listen. &&Fuck I want this bad. &&[I also wouldn't be too surprised to see Roxy come back as a villain, though likely a henchmen ala charlies character](#spoiler )&&Yeah that's a fair point too. I do enjoy his style but like I say I think he's just made too many films - if he'd made, say the first Saw film, Insidious, The Conjuring and Dead Silence (I know Dead Silence is seen as being really naff but I like it) I honestly think he'd be revered as a modern horror filmmaker &&I really enjoyed it. My friend put it best when she said ""I perversely enjoyed the plummeting ride when it went totally off the rails""&&> The show is also pretty serious (at least for a cartoon based on Legos) 

I know exactly what you mean, it was like that for the LEGO batman movie too. The games were funny and silly but also serious, the joke was that Batman was the only one taking things seriously. The LEGO batman movie (although I loved it) was completely different, *none* of the characters were serious, I mean the entire thing was basically a love/anti-love story between the joker and batman &&I don't know why Lego and Warner Bro didn't do more to promote the actual show on cartoon network. It would have made sense for them to push the show during the day instead of showing it at 6am on Saturdays. 

If they aired the show more or even in the week leading up to the movie's release they could have at least tricked more kids into getting their parents to take them. Instead they show 150 hours of Teen Titans Go. There was no synergy/cross promotion.
&&I kinda get the feeling Lego was hoping to improve their Ninjago IP with the movie, instead of improving the movie with their IP. They have a good thing going with movies now, and of course they could have done a Lego Star Wars Movie next, or Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, or Lego Justice League, or Lego Lord of the Rings, Lego Harry Potter. All of those would be easy and obvious hits.

But here's the thing, they still CAN do all of those, and Ninjago cannot take away, but by putting Ninjago alongside those, it makes it sound (especially to kids) like Ninjago should be considered to be on par with these other things.

It didn't work, but what if it had? Lego went from making plastic toys to being probably the #1 spoof house for video games and Movies in the world. What if they were able to spin those spoofs and toys into inventing a new craze? If one, why not more?

Modern setting, International themes, built around a cool archetype with a Father/Son atonement story at it's heart. Whose to say it could not have been the next Star Wars? It's not impossible to imagine live action, teenage oriented adaptations of Ninjago, or a book series, or a trading card game. 

They probably knew it was a long shot, but I totally see why they shot for it. They have so little to lose and so much to gain.&&Fellow lego fan here. It's not awful, just kinda generic, there is plenty of good stuff there, it's just not fully realised. And yeah, ditching the voice actors and continuity definitely felt like a slap to the core fans. 

That, and as an Aussie, its hard to forget Warners misteps with the Lego Batman movie. But thats an aside.

Its worth seeing if you're a lego fan. But there is nothing in it to rock your world like the first Lego movie did, and would have been better as one of the straight to DVD releases.&&As a Lego fan who doesn’t particularly care for Ninjago, the sets for the movie look freakin’ amazing. &&Jesus, isn't that like hundreds of dollars per year?&&Can you compare the movie to the show? For example, the lego batman games were awesome but the lego batman movie was a completely different style/universe. &&I mean, it *was* pretty good. &&Which is a shame, because some of the makeup and design *was* really good... but some of it was literally writing ""DAMAGED"" across the Joker's fucking noggin...&&fantasymovieleague.com&&I did it for awhile back in like 2009-10 but the amount of people waned a lot and I lost interest. 

Edit: It was pretty cool. &&Hell-o there.&&GODS I WAS THE DEVIL THEN&&Relevant username&&Cartoon Network hasn't been a competent company since 2013, if not longer.&&The really should just rename it to ""Teen Titans Network"". Why even bother to pretend they show anything else? 

Sorry I'm a little butthurt because of Steven Universe                &&It was his birthday last week, and she got him the city and dragonboat. The city looks pretty amazing. He's working on the dragon boat now.

But that's *7,000 more Lego pieces*.

It's really more than a little absurd.&&Grandmas gonna grandma.&&Would not be surprised if thousands.&&The show is pretty good, with a villain that changes every season though Garmadon is important all 3 of the seasons. It's cartoon too, not stop-motion. It's definitely aimed for children, though I enjoyed it anyways. Much better than the movie. &&I mean sure? It all looked pretty good but I imagine other movies did better than *pretty good* and I liked the movie. &&Was it though? I mean, it went up against Star Trek Beyond, which had far better looking make up IMO.&&what, having a damaged tattoo on your face isn't common or aesthetically pleasing? &&But they wrote it good&&Deadshot's suit looked fantastic. Captain boomerang was also pretty alright. The hot topic version of Harley was eh. El diablo looked badass though RIP&&oh&&Honestly I don't know what I expected &&I am a 5-star Demon!!!&&Haha yes I'm a batman fan. I actually thought the Lego movie looked horrible when I first saw trailers. Nothing like the batman I know, but I loved it anyway &&Longer&&What, you dont like 20 episodes of Teen Titans Go a day?&&I think we're all a little butt hurt over Steven Universe. It's a fantastic show that gets no respect by the network. Why even green light a show if you're only going to show it once every 6 months. 

Don't get me wrong because I find TTG to be very funny, but it's too much. CN has sacrificed almost everything for this show. Hell it even screwed over Young Justice. It's almost like if a show has any serialized story telling they kill it.&&Yeah, I think Star Trek was snubbed there because its make up was better imo. &&",2017-09-25 11:08:56

Alex Garland (Ex Machina)",26772,72kq03,https://i.imgur.com/fCMsyaK.jpg,1053,1506436294.0,,"[Go Behind-the-Scenes of Alex Garland’s ‘Stalker’-Inspired Sci-Fi Drama ‘Annihilation’](https://thefilmstage.com/news/go-behind-the-scenes-of-alex-garlands-stalker-inspired-sci-fi-drama-annihilation/).

[Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson from the set of ‘Annihilation’.
](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHNczpihxXS/)

[Article from EW](http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/26/annihilation-natalie-portman-alex-garland/).

> In the science fiction film Annihilation, Natalie Portman plays a scientist named Lena, who is part of an expedition tasked with exploring an area which has been taken over by a mysterious force. “[She] finds a very strange, dream-like, surrealist landscape, and goes deeper and deeper into that world, and also into that mindset,” says writer-director Alex Garland (Ex Machina). Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tuva Novotny, Gina Rodriguez, and Tessa Thompson costar as her fellow team members, while Oscar Isaac plays Portman’s husband. 

> One other character of note featured in the film? An alligator, as is revealed in EW’s exclusive first look photo, above. “It is their first tangible encounter with something strange,” says Garland. “The alligator has physical elements to it that should not belong on an alligator. They’re starting to get their heads around how weird the place is.”

> Annihilation is based on JeffVanderMeer’s 2014 novel, the first book in the Southern Reach trilogy, which the author continued with Authority and then wrapped up with Acceptance. “I was in post-production on Ex Machina, and one of the producers of that film, Scott Rudin, called up and said, ‘I just acquired this book, I think it’s interesting and, would you take a look,'” says Garland, whose screenwriting credits also include Dredd and 28 Days Later. “I don’t finish books, or films, or anything, really, if it isn’t grabbing me for one reason. Well, I read it in a sitting. I found the atmosphere incredibly strong and I liked the kind of dream state that it created and put me in. It had all sorts of qualities that I found really interesting. I thought immediately, Yes, I’d like to try this.”

> Isaac recently promised EW that Annihilation would be “very weird and very beautiful.” “That’s what we were shooting for,” says Garland. “The beauty part of it was quite important. Even when it’s grim, and something dark is happening, there’s quite an overt beauty, and we took pains to make sure that happened.”


> Although the original book is part of a trilogy, Garland says he regards his film as a standalone movie. “I did once work on a film called Dredd, which I imagined to be the first part of a trilogy,” says Garland. “But it’s not something I like doing. I’d rather work on a story that I felt was self-contained rather than one that sort of had a ‘dot-dot-dot’ at the end. I think that provokes a sort of instant, understandable, cynicism. We sense the money grab and I feel that pollutes the story. So, right from the get-go, I did not think of this as being part of a trilogy; I thought of it as being just a single, self-contained movie. If other people wanted to do that, that would be fine. That’s none of my business. But from my point of view, it’s just one.”

> Annihilation — a Paramount Pictures and Skydance presentation — is in theaters **Feb. 23, 2018.**&&The book is very mysterious. It will be interesting to see how it translates to film. &&I forgot all about this movie after its release date got pushed back to 2018. Very excited to see how Alex Garland does after Ex Machina which took most by surprise. &&Alex Garland sure likes to cast Oscar Isaac as a scientist in his films.&&Does Natalie Portman play an Investi-gator?


^I'll ^show ^myself ^out.&&All dem teeth and no toothbrush....&&I cannot wait for new movie from Alex Garland after Ex Machina.&&*""Hi, I'm Natalie Portman, welcome to Jackass!""*&&I'm stoked that Jennifer Jason Leigh is appearing in more stuff these days.&&Don't know much about this, but that's a nice croc prop.&&I see ex machina and Oscar Isaac in the title and you know I'm excited &&Reminds me of the plot of Stalker.&&Poe Dameron & Padme!?

Excellent movie!&&[deleted]&&Finally! - Crocodile Dentist, The Movie.&&Finished the Southern Reach trilogy not too long back, and I'm pretty excited for this film, the cast is stellar and this is easily the strongest book in the series.

Curious to see how they present some of the book content on the big screen, as [The Tunnel/Tower/Anomaly is such an alien concept alongside Saul & The Crawler](#spoiler). Really hope they use the [white rabbit sequence] (#spoiler) in this film, it's such a odd and unsettling scene from the second book and I feel it would do a great job helping set up Area X.
&&For a second, I thought this was a photoshop battle.&&Interesting. Oscar Isaac is tortured by Natalie Portman's grandson in one movie then plays her husband in another.&&Did you see the time on her watch? It's one o'croc.&&Oh wow I'm actually 3/4 through the book right now! It's verrrrry weird and mysterious and I'm not sure how they'll translate that to the film. Going in I expected much more focus on the nature/growth of Area X but it's been...different so far. I imagine there will be lots of flashback scenes but where the book focuses on the biologists thoughts and perceptions, i can see that being hard to get across via film.

I'm excited though!&&is this a movie about Natalie portman eating soup out of aligator mouths? if so, i'm in!&&>“I did once work on a film called Dredd, which I imagined to be the first part of a trilogy,” says Garland.

A lot of mystery and sci fi elements that make it a fun read.&&I pray for the trailer to release soon, to the old gods and the new.&&I have always had a soft spot for Jennifer Jason Leigh&&Jennifer Jason Leigh has been popping up everywhere lately. &&Missed a screening for this movie a month or two ago due to work, hate myself for it forever.

""I'll just catch it in... a year.""&&Where did Jennifer Jason Leigh disappear to for a decade or two?

I remember her being a B grade 80's actress that took the roles that required getting your boobs out then she seemed to drop off the face of the planet until recently. Now she seems to be quite busy again.

&&Don't know anything about this movie but pretty sure that holding a crocs mouth open like that is generally a bad idea&&I'm so happy that Jennifer Jason Leigh is in so much stuff recently. My favorite actress.&&This is exciting for me. First time I've read a book before the movie was even announced. I can finally be the smug jerk who talks about how much better the book was. &&Alex Garland and Oscar Isaac? And Nat Portman? i'll watch the mother fuck out of this. I mean if it had chastain i don't know what i would have done.&&As long as Portman wears those white pants from Star Wars I'll watch a 4 hour movie about dirt.  &&Why does the alligator/crocodile have to be white?&&Stalker is my favorite film of all-time, but the more I read/see about this the more I sense it wont' be all that similar. 

Examining the crocodile like ""oh interesting, look how weird this is"" to me puts it too far in the realm of observation and far away from surrealism. In Stalker, when weird things happen you don't have the characters talking about it obsessively, it just happens. That atmosphere creates an almost dreamlike trance that takes you to another place and gives the film its power. 

I'm sure the film will be interesting and worth watching, but it won't be what I was hoping. &&It's being directed by Michael Bay, so that alligator is seconds away from exploding.&&Just an FYI, but the books are awesome.

The story is very hard to sum up, but it's essentially a sci-fi story about the adaptability of nature and our place in it. Plus, there's vanishing rabbits, sentient cell phones and a man who washes a mouse.

I highly recommend the books, and anything Jeff Vandermeer has written. &&I feel as if this movie has been in development for 20 years. Just come out already!!&&Ok, stop I’m sold. The cast + director + sci-fi book + and he was involved in iconic movies like 28 days/weeks, Dredd and Ex-Machina

Something to look forward to early 2018 &&Who did they cast as Acererak? If this one is a success, maybe Wizards will make a Strahd movie!&&Ok, sold. When does it come out?&&Oh, HELL YES. I have been waiting so long for this adaption!&&I'm kind of off Natalie Portman at the moment since that horrible Dior commercial.&&Padmé and her grandson in one film!&&So I guess this confirms it. We're not getting a 'Crocodile Dentist' move.&&Poe banging Leia’s mom? sweet.&&I know you can hold a croc's mouth closed with very little effort, but isn't their clamp strength like 200 lbs per square inch or something even crazier?&&What the hell is this movie about? Nothing explaining it in the comments. Looks super interesting though.&&You'd think they would stop sending people after 11 expeditions...&&This is great. I bought Annihilation last week because I had time to kill and I picked it up from a bookstore. I read it in a single day. I'm almost done with the second book right now. I'm excited I think a movie will be great if they do it justice. &&I found the book so boring. Hope Garland does something more interesting with it. &&Trying to figure out what is in her hand anyone know is it a sugar spoon? Small knife, or magnifying glass?&&Wow! I didn't even know they were making this. This book was a huge surprise to me. It ended up being one of my favorite books I've read in quite a long time. 

I hope they keep the eerie and dread soaked atmosphere that the book did so well to create.&&Saw a early screening of this a few months back. An absolutely incredible film.&&Does anyone else find it interesting that Alicia Vikander looked like Natalie Portman in Ex Machina, and here, Alex Garland gets the real deal?&&Umm gators mouths have to be held from the bottom or they can still flip or roll or even use their mouth as leverage...&&Is that Claude the alligator?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(alligator)&&Just finished this trilogy recently and had no clue they're making a movie (are they doing the whole trilogy?).  I honestly don't know if they can pull it off but I'll be very excited if they do, I fucking LOVE Ex Machina!&&Nothing can hurt her. Haven't you heard her rap?&&Just finished the book over the weekend. Really enjoyed it. Can't wait to see this adaptation.&&You just know the first draft was called Annihiligator&&Saw the trailer + bits of footage of this (around 7 min) at the Paramount presentation during film market. Looks phenomenal (almost like a blend of Villeneuve's visuals and Garland's unique storytelling), albeit the trailer was a bit *too* spoiler-ish for my taste.

I suggest you go blind into the film.&&Anybody else find the novel totally uninspired and just plain dull? I pushed all the way through to the end, but no matter what, I couldn't get into it. &&Did Hollywood learn nothing from Battleship?

Edit: /S   

^^^^ffs&&When I read the book I was imagining what a great movie it would be and now it’s happening, can’t wait!&&Sounds like a Stalker-type movie&&I wonder if having an actor named Oscar has any subliminal effect on viewers.&&""annie? are you in there annie?""&&She won't die from an Alligator, she'll just lose the will to live.&&Damn JJL has been busy. Seen her in Good Time, mother! and Atypical just these past two months&&Looks like a pretty damn good prop of a albino crocodile. &&So you could say this movie already got oscar&&Alex Garland is a great writer and Ex Machina was an outstanding first touch at direction. 

I have no idea what this is or that it existed until now but I now have high expectations ;)&&Yes fuck yes Garland is the man, anything he is involved in is gold&&I would honestly watch anything that involves Natalie Portman.&&Looks like the world’s most dangerous cereal bowl.&&I have a gut feeling this is going to be good. Cannot wait to see more collaboration between Garland and Hardy.&&glad to hear garland was a fan of the book, the trilogy is really a unique experience&&I read annihilation twice, I really love that book. did anyone else find the second book just... boring? I feel like this movie being a standalone film is a good idea. &&and now i'm really sad we won't get any more Dredd&&Yup, I'm officially shitting my pants in excitement&&They tell us The Biologist's name. Movie ruined.&&I respect his approach, but man, this is one book series I'd like to see fully adapted. The two subsequent books aren't quite as strong as Annihilation, but they are just as completely batshit insane and full of weird ideas. Not sure exactly how they'd work on film, though -- especially the second one, Authority, which is largely about a guy investigating a fucked up government program and dealing with its surreal bureaucracy -- but I'd sure like to see someone like Garland try.&&I came here for this description - thank you.&&Good bot.&&This sounds a lot like Roadside Picnic/Stalker.&&...did they just name the biologist?
&&Note that the article spelled Oscar Isaac's name right.&&I'm on book two of the Southern Reach trilogy. I had no idea they were making them into movies.


I also have no clue what they're going to include in Annihilation. It's...weird. &&Thanks for including this - officially excited for this!&&I think this will be one of the rare cases where the adaptation surpasses the original. Without spoiling anything, there are a lot of elements in the book that would benefit from being shown instead of described. In the movie, a sense of uncanny atmosphere can envelop the viewer instead of being painstakingly constructed through some imagined POV as text necessitates. I can't remember the last time I was this excited for a movie. I'm sure as hell not watching a trailer, and that should go double for anyone who's already sold on this but hasn't read the book.&&I am, too! I don't think the other two in the series would make great films, but this one definitely has potential.&&So mysterious that I didn't even know it was being turned into a movie, really looking forward to this!&&She's co-authored 2 published research papers for..... wait for new movie from Alex Garland does after Ex Machina.&&I read the first book, and found it frustrating and repellent.  It was more feathers than meat.  Much of the book was given over to mood and confusion, interspersed with tons of flashbacks.

For some reason, I started reading the second book in the series, looking for answers, I guess.  I was about a third of the way in before I bailed. It was just more of the same, and worse than the first.

And yet I think the idea of making this trilogy into a set of films is interesting, especially given the star power and direction.  It's quite possible they'll make something that surpasses the source material.&&I liked the first book but found the second book boring. Is the third one better?&&The author of the book compared the movie to '2001: A Space Odyssey'.

I'm hyped.&&Ex Machina was great. Idk why it would ""took most by surprise"" he was the writer for The Beach, 28 Days Later, and Sunshine. All of which were fantastic. 
And he learned from Danny Boyle, who I consider one of the best&&He's not a scientist in the movie&&Oscar Isaac is actually the crocodile pictured here&&I’ll take Oscar however I can get them. So far, outside of Xmen, he’s the best part of the films he’s in. He owned Llewyn Davis like a boss, and made sucker punch not watchable, per se, but it made it more interesting. &&you say that like the guy has directed more than two films.&&There could be worse things to be cast as.&&>Does Natalie Portman play **and** Investi-gator?

Good riddance&&Yep, and then she meets Annie-Gator.&&See ya later...alligator...


...sorry.&&I liked that one, you can stay. &&Mama's wrong again!&&I'm sorry but this comment sounds like it was written by a robot&&Didn't even realize he was directing now.  I love his novels.  The Beach and the Tesseract are both favorites.&&It's impossible go to wrong with that cast + Alex Garland.&&I have to give ex machina another watch, I got like 2/3 of the way through and just stopped watching, I completely lost interest&&Damn Natalie, you a crazy chick!&&If her character is anything like how she's written in the book, we're in for a treat. There's one specific scene with her that I'm 99.99 percent positive they'll include in the movie (people who read the book know what I'm talking about) that was one of the creepiest things I've ever read. &&She was absolutely brilliant in The Hateful Eight! Her role was Oscar worthy in my opinion. &&It's true. Of all the croc props I've seen, that there is one of the nicest. Grade A croc prop. &&Yeah, I'm just sitting here thinking, ""Don't they have one of the highest bite pressures in the world?  I don't think Nature Boy there is going to be able to stop that thing from chomping down.""&&If he doesn't pull a Pretty Woman when Natalie Portman goes to look at it, I'm going to be disappointed. &&Might be a real croc actually, looks like they're using forced perspective to make it look like she is fooling around inside his mouth, but you can kind of tell that she's actually pretty far behind it. So yeah, could be a real croc with a real handler. &&I worked on this! The croc is mostly CGI in the film so I apologise special effects purists. &&Oscar Isaac is an incredible actor, but he was exceptional under Garland's direction in Ex Machina. I also loved his short, but beautiful performance in Drive. The scene when he interrupts Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in the hallway when he's taking out the trash is one of my favourite scenes in all movies in the past few years.&&Right!?&&[deleted]&&Lol u have no idea. Read the first book, then come back :)&&I thought exactly the same.
&&Blowout soon, Padme.&&[deleted]&&My lord...is that legal?&&What if it's already dead and its neck is broken? Look behind the ~~guy's~~ girl's legs.

EDIT - Gender.&&Was hoping to find someone who knew of this in this thread.&&The emotional roller coaster during the second half of the movie was intense. Should I be happy, sad, angry, frightened with the ending? Ugh! &&I would qualify the book as cosmic horror among other things. It's kinda hard to nail down one exact genre but it very much falls under the weird fiction category. &&Unexplained nature phenomena vs scientists/expedition volunteers. &&The books are but I don't think the movie is going to cover enough ground to really go as far with it as the books do.&&And ...you stole my joke. Well played sir...well played. &&Came here for this&&Not to dash any hopes but I wouldn't expect them to use the white rabbit sequence. Garland began writing Annihilation before the second and third books came out and he adapted it as a standalone rather than as the intro to a trilogy. &&Saw the film about a month ago.  What's the WR sequence?&&By the look on her face I think a bug flew into her soup&&They're talking about doing a Dredd TV show with Karl Urban.&&>Of the Naboo*

FTFY&& Unlike humans, crocs and alligators mouths open from the top and the bottom remains stationary, if that makes sense.

Wat&&So what's the point of the books?  What exactly is the story about??&&And they're married!&&Garland began work on the movie before the second and third book were out and wrote it as an individual movie rather than the start of a trilogy. So we could get the full trilogy, but I wouldn't count on it. &&Damn Natalie you ah crazy bitch&&Instructions unclear, walked blind folded in to a cinema and am now trapped in a closet.&&To each their own, but I found Annihilation to be one of the most engrossing things I ever read. I started it one morning and ended up bringing it along to a pool party and ignoring everything going on cause I couldn't put it down. &&No&&One of the most boring books I ever read&&Don't forget her role in the new Twin Peaks alongside Tim Roth again (both in Hateful Eight together).&&Without spoiling anything, can you describe what the thrust of the story is? Beyond ""weird things get investigated"". Is it hard sci-fi, does it turn into existential horror, is it a religious allegory, it is about the hubris of man, is it ultimately about father-daughter relationships? &&I had no idea that they based this on the book!

Worth sticking with?&&I'm happy the book(s) are being adapted, hopefully I'll finally know what the hell was happening in that story &&Its been a while since I read it but it strikes me as a pretty difficult book to translate to film, I will be interested to see how it turns out.&&I found the book utterly dull and rather pointless. Unanswered questions are one thing, but there were *no* answered questions. He created this mystery but didn't create a world to back that up.

I ended up just reading summaries of the followup books and they looked awful. &&Some of the most unique, beautiful writing I've ever read. &&I didn't even know those books were popular enough to warrant a movie. Crazy. I didn't really read the second one. How was the third? &&> I feel like this movie being a standalone film is a good idea.

Garland only said that ***he*** was treating it as a standalone film. That's not to say the *producers* are doing the same. In fact, I would be very surprised if the case was not signed for sequels. NO ONE buys the rights to just the first book in an established trilogy without acquiring the rest. Especially Scott Rudin. &&*Authority* is actually my favorite book in the trilogy, but to each their own.&&Spot on! Read the first book in like 3 hours, utterly swallowed it! Then I just died trying to get through book 2 - very boring, such a shame...&&I *love* the first book. I got about 2/3rds of the way through the second and gave up. Then I re-read the first book a couple times and came to appreciate it as a stand-alone, coming to peace with the end along with the biologist.

A year or two later, I was on a re-read of book one at the local bar and the bartender convinced me to finish the trilogy, even letting me borrow her copies. I read them and I really regret it. The third book was better than the second, but had a fatal flaw in the story structure (imho) and it ruined the biologists arc from the first book.

I've been actively trying to block books 2 and 3 out of my mind to save the wonderfulness of book 1.&&I bought the compilation book mainly because of the beautiful cover. I thought the idea of the book was great, but I hated reading it. For me it was a struggle to finish it.
That being said, I will probably watch the movie and I hope its great.
&&Second book could have been condensed and combined into the third and it would have been better. Control is just the worst character. I hated him.&&Yeah I didn't have any interest in continuing in the world after the first book. I liked the weirdness in Annihilation, but I rarely think of it, don't remember all that much [other than the stair way that just kept getting deeper and deeper](#spoiler)

I'm surprised it is getting a movie, I hope it is weird and good.

And actually I only just remembered that I did read part of the second book and definitely agree.&&I liked the second book but largely because I identified with some of the bizarre office games/hijinks that made the book almost read like a dark satire compared to the first book. &&Totally agree. I never got through the second one.

It's a good decision to make this movie stand alone.&&I zoomed through the first book,  struggled through the second,  and gave up about 60 pages into the third.  Just didn't keep its steam for me.  &&I tried reading the second, but it just didn't capture my attention. I might have made it halfway but I gave up&&Yeah, first book was amazing. Gave up on the 2nd book unfortunately although I want to pick it u again.&&I couldn't bring myself to read the third after I finished the second. It was such a chore to get through. First was pretty great though&&Pleased you said this. I really couldn't get into it&&I finally finished book 2 yesterday, after slogging through it for like 2 months (which is saying something, considering how relatively short those books are)... I really, *really* didn't like book 2. I found almost nothing about it interesting, whereas I loved book 1 and devoured it in a couple of days.&&Well to be fair that was kind of the point of the second book. Not being boring per say, but showing that even behind something as weird and unwieldy as Area X, there were average people doing menial office stuff. I found it interesting as a sort of companion piece to the first book, that you read to get tidbits of information about various characters, and Area X itself.&&I put down the second book after about 50 pages.  It just could not hold my interest.  I did like the first book though - I thought it was a fun mystery. &&I'm halfway through the third. It does the thing where the chapters represent different view points. Second is definitely more spy style with they strange bureaucracy and the uncertainty in people and personal observations that can be trusted.  Maybe read the last 1/5 of the second just to get to the third? I'm liking the 3rd so far. Back to mystery adventure.  Hopefully sticks the landing! &&The second book kind of dragged, but I liked how the third felt like a combination of the first two.&&Yup. Couldn't make it through Authority. The only series this has ever happened. Luckily the first book makes a great stand-alone story.&&Agree that the 2nd one is a little more boring. But, it's worth reading to get to the 3rd one...&&The second book was boring until about halfway.

That scene... in the space in the drop ceiling... was the first time since I was a child that a book had literally made my skin crawl. I made an involuntary noise.

Then at the end... with the description of her eyes. One of the best scenes in the series.&&Agreed. Still yet to get to the third, but I've heard it's closer in quality to book 1. &&Second book was bad until the last dozen or so pages, third one was better, but the first was stunning. Wish I had just stopped reading there. Kind of hoped it was going to go in a direction that it just never did. Total let down. &&sorry i think i am out of the loop.  why is that?  same director?&&/r/JudgeDreddMegaCityOne&&Somebody is shitting my pants, too!&&RIP pants.&&In *excrement!!!&&Thanks god I wasn't the only one who was DAMN BUT WHY &&Why is that bad? I haven't read the book. &&See, I'm actually quite worried about the translation from novel to film. So much of the book is an attempt to describe that which cannot be described. For instance, [at the end, when the biologist actually encounters the Crawler. She first tries to describe it, but fails, and specifically says she closes her eyes and tries to rely on her other senses to describe what she is experiencing](#spoiler). I just don't know how well this will translate to a visual medium, but I am excited to find out! I loved Ex Machina so I have faith in Alex Garland, just hope he can pull it off.&&I agree with you, that a visual version of this story could surpass the books. But I have no expectations that this will be the case.

To me, the books get by mostly on atmosphere, and this is in spite of an almost painfully slow drip of plot information (that slow drip isn't a selling point like it is in a lot of books; it's just covering up for a fairly slight plot). The plot is somewhat interesting and a couple of the characters are minutely fleshed out, but the steam behind the novels is the overbearing weirdness of the environment.

A really atmospheric and oppressively weird visual style to the set design and cinematography could result in something really special movie, but I don't have high expectations. Simply because so few directors/studios seem to have the stomach to go for something that is visually stimulating/unsettling at the expense of plot. Which I think is essentially what you'd be doing if you were true to the spirit of the books. Studios don't typically pay Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac level salaries to make something as weird as the books are. 

I hope I'm wrong though.&&Have you read what all they are leaving out?   I'm sure it will be good... Garland is very talented but it won't surpass the mystery of the book.&&> I think this will be one of the rare cases where the adaptation surpasses the original.

Not for nothing, but I'm 100% sure that Ready Player One will also benefit from this translation.&&I've never heard of it before but this thread got my attention. Should I read the book now or wait for the movie? &&This is Garland, though. I have to take it with a grain of salt. Ruiner of third acts.

 Ex Machina - great all the way and then turns into a David Mamet film.

28 Days Later - the first 45 minutes are quite possibly the best for a horror film then turns into love story. I was left like wtf?!? 

Tbf, I haven't seen Dredd. 


After all that, I'm going to see it and, hopefully, Garland stays consistent to the end.&&By extension is he comparing himself to A.C. Clarke? Humble.&&Saw it about a month ago.  It's not on an epic scale like 2001 is but it is about human exploration of the unknown and their place in the universe. Maybe that's where the author is coming from (Full disclosure: I haven't read the book and didn't know the film was based on anything when I saw it)&&Most people don't know Alex Garland's background.&&Holy shit. All those films are on his resume? This Garland fellow ain't no chump. &&[According to the book's plot synopsis, he was part of the previous expedition.](#spoiler)&&[If you've read the books you'd know that that isn't terribly farfetched of a claim.](#spoiler) Also, that's actually an alligator.&&Acting.&&He ALWAYS casts Oscar Isaac! &&""You're breaking my heart, Ani-Gator!""&&No YOURE wrong Colonel Sanders!!! &&I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I'm going to see it again and again.&&[deleted]&&HAHA YES I TOO NOTICED THE MECHANICAL LANGUAGE THAT MY FELLOW HUMAN USED&&Doesn’t look like anything to me&&Aren't we all?&&After Ex Machina I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. &&He wrote another short novel with his dad called The Coma. It's pretty amazing as well.  I adore Garland, The Beach is still one of my favorite books. The ending was way better than the film!&&No it’s not &&Except, you know for the plot. &&YO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND SUCK MY DICK&&Top notch gator grade. Look at the mm ridges, that leathery skin. Awesome croc prop. Tip top. 

Tip top croc prop.

&&It looks dead to me... &&Yeah. That was what I was thinking when I saw the picture too.  No way a person can prop open a gator’s jaws.  A person can only hold the jaws closed since their strength to open is much weaker than strength to close.  Would be much more realistic if they had put something between the jaws to prop it open. &&Also, it's the mandible that moves and not the maxilla. Holding the maxilla won't stop the mandible from closing on Natalie Portman's head&&Not even slightly, no.

The trick with crocs and gators is that while they have colossal closing strength, they've got almost nothing on the opening side.  

You can stop them from *opening* their mouth with your hands.  

*Closing their mouth?*  You've just ***lost*** those hands.&&The Nature Boy could wrestle that gator any time any where, and at Wrestlemania, you're gonna see just what he's capable of! Wooooo!&&Get that croc in a figure 4 leg lock and we'll see how useful that bite pressure is. &&See!? It's so realistic! 

I'm not sure about forced perspective. She's casting a shadow on the front of the lower jaw.&&I can't  explain what it is about ex machina that made it so great but I do know it's one of the best movies from this decade  &&Yeah, sounds a ton like Roadside Picnic from what I have been able to tell. 

Super excited - It's such a great story, I have always been surprised that nobody has really done it since Stalker.&&It's Roadside Picnic + H.P. Lovecraft's The Colour Out of Space + Algernon Blackwood's The Willows.

It's the journey elements of Roadside Picnic, set in an expanded version of the setting from The Willows, with the events of The Colour Out of Space being the cause. That's Area X in a nut shell.&&Well I love Lovecraft so I'll probably check out the first book at least.&&It sounds interesting, I might just do that.&&Yea I didn't mean in a bad way either, it's one of my favorite films. Definitely curious about this movie!&&[deleted]&&Padme? Big Padme? Waaaaaaa&&girls legs* 
The book is about an all female team exploring area X.&&So frightened for me. It made me feel kinda sick.&&Exactly! I was utterly confused by the ending, like in a good way, it made me think hard. &&Was inspired to read the first book from this thread, and I'm nearly completely done with it as of right now. Lots of existential....stuff too. Not horror, just stuff.  &&Well hopefully he can make it into his own film, whilst respecting the source material. The first book still has a really unsettling atmosphere so let's see what Garland can do with it.&&In the second book, Authority, [The Southern Reach send something like 1000 white rabbits directly into the border just after it appears, in order to see what happens. It doesn't end well, and I found it one of the better sections in the trilogy due to it's vicerol nature](#spoiler).&&Yep, great stuff.

I don't think those parts will be in the movie, which is a shame.&&[deleted]&&Ah, interesting, thank you!  It's kind of funny cause the part where I thought, ""Okay, there's no way they could make these as movies,"" was in the third book so, yeah, they'll probably not get that far.  I'm excited but nervous for this.  I feel like, if well done, could be one of the most unique sci-fi movies/adaptations to date.&&99% of the people in here speak very highly of the first novel, I definitely need to check it out. 

Do you recommend I wait until after the movie is out? I kind of want to go into the movie with zero preconceptions. &&Existential horror for sure. It's not hard sci-fi at all as it remains mysterious. Movie will be completely different because they're already using names.&&[deleted]&&Without spiling anything... Only read book one.  It's when the macguffin is trying to be explained that it loses it a bit.  And this is coming from someone that really enjoyed the trilogy as a whole.  But holy fuck that first book is so good it had nowhere lse to go but downward in quality.&&Hard to spoil a story in which nothing happens... /s

I'll be honest I gave up halfway through the 2nd book. The 1st has a cool atmosphere, and it can be genuinely creepy at times... But yeah. Not that easy to explain the thrust of the story.

Weird things happen... Then more weird things happen... &&Hey I wanted to give you the opinion of someone who loves existential horror and lovecraftian themes as described by the other commenters, but REALLY didn't enjoy these books. They are very engrossing as you get going, but there are zero answers. It's very much one of those ""subjective experience"" type books where there are 1,000 different meanings and no clarity, even at the very end.

Some people might love that but I want answers to the mysteries posed by a book. Especially a sci-fi adventure type book. All you get by way of payoff here is vague themes and indistinct theories. 

You might still enjoy it - but you need to know what you're getting yourself into or you might be as wildly disappointed as I was.

Edit: It's impossible for a movie to be true to the books without coming off as an incoherent arthouse indie project&&It's a little of all of that. &&If you didn't like the writing style, there's really no point to them.  The appeal is all about the mood and feeling of the books, not the plot or ideas. &&That seems crazy to me because I got sucked in so quickly with the first book; it had this really intense, foreboding feeling that I thought Vandermeer captured so well. I couldn't put it down. I'm on the 2nd book now and its a completely different style and frankly a bit disappointing after how great I thought the first book was.&&Found the author.&&I really liked the third. Not as exciting as the first, but had some huge ideas and crazy imagery. &&Better but still no where near book 1. Very glad he’s treating this as it’s own story. That’s how I recommend the books &&I tried the second one twice and failed to finish it both times. a friend of mine told me that all the questions the first book raises are never answered even in the third book. &&There are tons of books that aren't really all that popular that get made into movies.  It's just source material.

I don't think they're intending to prop it up like The Hunger Games or a Stephen King book made into a movie.  It's just based on a book, like countless other movies are based on books that most people never heard of.&&In fairness, the other books feel like they would make really bad movie material to give an honest adaptation to. I'm actually really unconvinced that doing these books as discussed makes sense to begin with, though the first is probably the most moviefiable of them.&&The ending is what sold me on Authority. It took a long time for the character to click for me, which I think is intentional on Vandermeer's part.&&Yeah, it's absolutely incredibly good.&&I don’t know if it’s my favorite, but I like it a lot. It’s weird seeing so many people in this thread saying they hated it so much they didn’t even finish it.

I think a lot of people must have went into the series thinking it was hard sci fi instead of the intensely weird fiction/existential horror that it actually is. Then they were disappointed that not everything is explained and wrapped up neatly.&&it went from exciting being from the biologist's perspective in the first book to utterly boring following control and his position in the company in the second. indeed a shame&&I just about threw my book into a river when I got to the chapter that ended along the lines of ""he is Control, and he is in control."" I know he was supposed to be weak and hard to like, but it really dragged the book down. And his redemption arc in the third book was pretty lame too. &&I agree. Thought 2 was building up to something great in 3 hence why I powered through, but it was really a let down by the end. Characters got really dry.&&That's where I'm at currently. I loved the first book... just finished the second yesterday, and I don't think I'll bother reading the third. I really didn't like book 2 at all.&&>sorry i think i am out of the loop.  why is that?

I'm assuming it's because OP liked the first one. &&I just shipped your pants!&&who, me?&&We never learn The Biologist's name in the book is all. Nitpicking is all.&&[deleted]&&Same problem as translating H.P. Lovecraft into film. When the mystery/horror comes from the inability to even describe what's being seen it just doesn't easily translate to a visual medium. &&Garland has some experience of sorts with this as he demonstrated on his film Sunshine, without giving it away the main antagonist/creature is never viewed correctly, there's a visual interference and editing style that prevents a solid look. I will say it's probably the most criticized part of the film, though, maybe he's thinking of giving it another try/different approach with Annihilation.&&You're totally right - there are parts of the story that will be tougher visually than via text. At that scene in particular will be hard to pull off, if it's preserved. By the end of the story, though, all veils are lifted, so Garland can probably maintain some mystery before a climax. Worst case is an unsuccessful attempt at presenting something as otherworldly, like was done towards the end of Sunshine. (An aside: it was actually an ingenious [practical camera trick](https://theasc.com/ac_magazine/August2007/Sunshine/page4.html) they employed to get [that effect](https://youtu.be/nfBOL-hn2l4?t=23s), I just don't think it worked as intended.)  

I feel like there are a lot more moments that will be favored on screen, while in the book the author had to deliberately maintain ambiguity and it was almost distracting. *This [thing] looked wrong somehow, almost like [X], but I couldn't be sure.* Those moments grated on me in the book, but would give me goosebumps if pulled off in the movie using subtle visual cues. &&Yeah, that scene could be tough unless they go the Rosemary's Baby route. &&I don't know what's in/out and I'm not sure I want to know. Don't get me wrong - the book was great. But I felt like I liked it more for what it *wanted to be* than for what it actually was. Certain moments took me out of the story, where I couldn't help but think ""oh, the author is telling the reader that X is happening, but our main character is not sure of that, so we have to play dumb"". In a movie, I feel like the audience can be just as in-the-loop as the main character, and that could be much more powerful. This is a weird way to think about a story, and my thinking this way is definitely inspired by the book aiming for a very specific flavor of mystery. &&The version of 2001 we all know and love was inspired more by Kubrick than Clarke. &&Novelists are known for their self-effacing and humble nature. 

To be honest, I can see how a writer can have a massive ego. A writer is in a unique situation concerning his work in contrast to other fields. An painter paints a work and has them hang in a place where they can be admired or sold, an actor puts on a character and goes home at the end of the day as himself. A writer? His oeuvre is literally his own brain on ink and pulp, speaking directly to other brains.

Oh, here's just years of my life building an entire world where heroes face odds of my own creation, where everything is the fruit of my own thought. And then to have hundreds of thousands of people to millions line up to read, buy your works and deluge you with adoration? ('Your book changed my life/I was going to commit suicide until I read your book on talking toilet plungers"") And oh, did I mention that all those folks made you rich? The legions of impressionable teen to twenty something girls all swooning over your genius, the depth of your prose, the lilting deft tones, the crescendoes of plot and drama -- all uncontrollably gushing from their vaginas like poorly installed faucets by illiterate plumbers (qual es halabra en espanol para 'building code?') but do you take advantage of those starving vaginae, eager for the essence of a master? No, you stick with your current girlfriend thanks to some antiquated sense of honor and loyalty and remain faithful, all three attributes which were largely absent in her and that fucking loathsome lothario Raoul as they screwed away like snakes in the tall grass, and by tall grass I mean that memory-foam king-size bed that your novel paid for in the apartment that the novel paid for. Fuck you Anna you duplicitous Jezebel, you philandering whore of Babylon I hope you die.

We haven't seen any footage yet, lets temper our expectations.

Thanks!&&*...and all the dudes, you know I'm talking to you*

*""We love you Natalie!""* *I wanna fuck you too!*

She deserved an Emmy.&&Oh.&&Yeah, as a huge fan of the books, I was apprehensive at first that it would not be a faithful adaptation. After watching Ex Machina, I have faith that Garland can make it a great movie even if it isn't exactly the same. &&Yeah, I'm going into it without expecting a direct adaptation of the series and I have pretty high hopes. If it is anywhere near as good as Ex Machina, I'll probably walk away happy. &&I will add to the praise. It is easily in my top 5 favorite books. 

Regarding seeing the movie before reading the book, it's hard to say as I have not yet seen it. I'd say it's personal preference. But I can say for sure that, based on what they've released and what I've seen from people who caught sneak previews of the movie, the movie will not be a 100% direct translation of the book. &&From what I understand the movie is its own thing, it's not slavishly recreating the novel. I think you can experience them in any order and still be satisfied by both.&&It's basically a Lovecraftian tone in a more grounded, natural, terrestrial setting.&&Any recommendations for something along the premise of this (strange desolate land with weird creatures and stuff happening) that IS a hard sci-fi?&&I'm disappointed to hear that - it seemed like originally they were going to stick to just using their titles. Weird that they decided to use names. &&Them not having names was a significant part of the plot. It's so weird, why would they drop it? &&I don't think it's hard sci-fi but I agree with the rest

I'd argue it's more in line with philosophical sci-fi, like what you'd see in a Tarkovsky movie&&I don't think they're hard sci-fi at all, they don't fully explain anything or even look for really scientific explanations.

People keep calling them sci-fi books, publishers and book stores included, but they're actually weird fiction or cosmic horror. The closest thing you get to an explanation for area X is *pure* cosmic horror.

Weird fiction/cosmic horror includes a lot of sci-fi elements though, so I see why it gets classified as such for marketing purposes. But I think that creates a misconception, where a lot of people view them as sci-fi books and so they grabbed a popular sci-fi reading crowd, which wasn't really the best audience. It's a great book that hooks a lot of different readers because it's part of a trilogy, so they start to expect explanations in the sequels because that's what sci-fi does, but then those explanations never come and it leads to people having issues with the second and third book. You can see comments down the page where people act in the exact way I'm describing.

The sequels come off a lot better if you recognize the genres a bit.&&Does it have similar themes to Michael Chrichtons Jurassic Park/Lost world novels? 

Thats the vibe i’m getting from everyone’s descriptions.&&I don't know man, the third one was really great to me. The second one meandered quite a bit, but the third one is just pure unabashed cosmic horror in the best of ways. The shit at the lighthouse is amazing. I would not want anyone to miss it. &&Exact same for me. Just didn't get the point of the first book, read about half of the second and gave up. Feel like I missed something because so many people love the books.&&No s needed. Nothing happens and I also gave up after 1.5 books.&&The third book offers some explanation, but it does not tie up all the loose ends. &&Can't upvote this enough - read the first two chapters and if you're like ""wow, that was well written and I can't wait to read more"" then by all means continue.

But if you're like ""that was vague and dumb and nothing happened, what's even going on in this book""... well... It's not going to get any easier for you.&&The third is a return to the feel of the first book, if not the narrative structure. The third also gives you a few answers, but not all of them. &&Acceptance is such a beautiful book.&&Agreed. The second book didn't hit me the same as the first book, though I did find myself wrapped up in moments of the story. &&VanDerMeer isn't interested in answering questions.  
That's just a statement, not a critique.&&I'd say quite a lot are. You find out what is at the heart of Area X, how it started and why Southern Reach is such a total shit show of an agency.&&The second book is a climb. But once you reach a certain point towards the end (not a spoilder, but it involves Whitby and some spooky stuff) starts it becomes easy and suspencul reading. I really recommend getting through it because it adds a lot to the third book.&&The third book does hint at something, but I think the horror/mystery would really suffer if it was explained.&&Kvothe did you say?&&Yeah. Authority would need to lean super heavily on a paranoid and oppressive atmosphore. Otherwise it's just weird and annoying stuff happening to a guy at his office.&&I thought that the second book had just as cool imagery and creepy stuff as the first, but it really struggled connecting everything. It just kind of lurched from weird thing to weird thing, where as the first one was such a smooth build up of creepiness. &&Seriously fuck Control. I wanted to read about Area X, not his mommy issues. &&I liked 3 but i would have preferred to see how the world reacts to area x when it can't be hidden anymore. That felt ignored in favour of retreading similar themes to book 1.&&Sure but why would this movie mean we don't get a dredd sequel?&&It was very convenient!&&It's understandable though. I imagine most moviegoers would be somewhat annoyed if the characters were only ever referred to by their titles.&&It's doable. Stranger Things comes to mind as it was difficult to really know what you were looking at in the upside down. Even the Demogorgon was tough to fully visualize until it was put into the school where everything else was normal. &&That is a great description of my experience with the books. VanderMeer’s use of the unreliable narrator is fantastic and, for me, this adds to the horror of the situations. And you’re right everything seems ... shrouded.

*SPOILER*: I still think about the part where a character, I forget which, watches a video recording of a previous expedition, and the fate of what happened to them around the campfire. It was truly chilling without actually describing anything in detail. Interesting to see how that would translate to film if there did end up being a trilogy *SPOILER END*&&Whoa - I [just responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/72kq03/new_image_from_annihilation_natalie_portman_oscar/dnjln8i/) to someone else here and brought up Sunshine without even remembering that Garland wrote it. I think he's drawn to the otherworldly & uncanny, but the third act dropped ball isn't really on handling that character - the movie was totally out of Garland's control by the time those specific decisions were made. As I hinted in the other post, I *hated* that visual interference thing since I thought it was cheap, junky VFX done in post because they weren't happy with how the character's suit/makeup looked or something. When I learned how they actually did it (and that it was intentional), I gained respect for the technique & intent but I still don't think it *worked* for the movie. It didn't feel like that distortion/otherworldliness was happening *in the world of the movie*, it felt like it was happening as part of the film-making process... and this was quite distracting. There's also zero physical basis for the character looking like that, so it makes the movie less immersive.  

Garland nailed just about every visual in Ex Machina (one instance of injury/blood was iffy), and I'm assuming he'll get a bit more of a budget for Annihilation than the $15M he put to great use on Ex Machina. &&Wow, I didn't get the impression at all that Pinbacker was supposed to be ""changed"" in any way besides being sunburned and crazy. &&The movie is gonna be beautiful either way.

wait&&Sold!  Thank you!&&Dune&&Well it doesn't involve open landscapes, but I'm currently reading House Of Leaves, which has a prety similar feel to the Southern Reach trilogy.&&Roadside Picnic by the Strugazki brothers. It's about six zones around the world that have been contaminated by an unknown alien presence just like Area X in the Southern Reach trilogy. In those zones there a invisible extradimensional traps that can kill you instantly, but also alien artefacts that are very precious. There are people called stalkers that can navigate the zones and live off the artefacts they find there. Here's a taste:

> “I lock myself in the stall, take out the flask, unscrew it, and attach myself to it like a leech. I’m sitting on the bench, my heart is empty, my head is empty, my soul is empty, gulping down the hard stuff like water. Alive. I got out. The Zone let me out. The damned hag. My lifeblood. Traitorous bitch. Alive. The novices can’t understand this. No one but a stalker can understand. And tears are pouring down my face—maybe from the booze, maybe from something else. I suck the flask dry; I’m wet, the flask is dry. As usual, I need just one more sip. Oh well, we’ll fix that. We can fix anything now. Alive. I light a cigarette and stay seated. I can feel it—I’m coming around.” &&I wouldn't say this is at all Lovecraftian/existential horror, nor is it all that desolate, but it does seem to tick some of the boxes you are looking for:

*The Integral Trees* by Larry Niven, and to a lesser extent it's sequel, *The Smoke Ring.*

While I have heard from many who don't like it, the two books are some of my favorites simply for the world that Niven creates.

The story takes place inside of a gas torus that orbits a star. The setting is definitely one of the aspects that make the story so great because it is just such a bizarre and alien setting that Niven did a lot of research on in order to make the most believable and realistic seeming biological structures as possible. 

While long, I will add the wiki pages description of its setting, because the setting really is what gives this story life:

>The story occurs around the fictional neutron star Levoy's Star (abbreviated ""Voy""). The gas giant Goldblatt's World (abbreviated ""Gold"") orbits this star just outside its Roche limit and therefore its gravity is insufficient to keep its atmosphere, which is pulled loose into an independent orbit around Voy and forms a ring that is known as a gas torus. The gas torus is huge—one million kilometers thick—but most of it is too thin to be habitable. The central part of the Gas Torus, where the air is thicker, is known as the Smoke Ring. The Smoke Ring supports a wide variety of life.

>No ""ground"" exists in the Smoke Ring; it consists entirely of sky. Furthermore, the Smoke Ring is in orbit and therefore in free fall: there is no ""up"" or ""down"". Most animals have trilateral symmetry that allows them to see in all directions. The majority of Smoke Ring animals have evolved to fly on at least an occasional basis—even the fish. The Smoke Ring contains numerous ""ponds,"" globs of water of various sizes which float free like everything else. While there are aquatic and amphibious animals in the Smoke Ring that live the majority of their lives in such ponds, these animals may find their habitat unsuitable at any moment. Whether their home pond drifts too far out of the habitable center of the Smoke Ring and into the gas torus, becomes too large and breaks up due to tidal forces, or impacts a large object such as an integral tree, aquatic animals must be able to propel themselves through the air sometimes in order to find a new place to live.

>Most plants in the Smoke Ring are quite fragile because they do not need to support their own weight. A notable exception to this rule are the eponymous Integral Trees, which can grow up to 100 kilometers long. Tidal locking causes them to be radially oriented, with one end pointing in toward Voy while the other points toward space. The ends of the tree feel a tidal force of up to 1/5 ɡ0 on the largest trees. Each end of a tree is a green, leafy tuft.

>An integral tree tuft is up to 50 kilometers from the tree's center of mass. Thus, a tuft is either orbiting too slowly (the ""in"" tuft) or too quickly (the ""out"" tuft) compared to the atmosphere, which is in orbit at all points. The ends of the tree are therefore subject to a constant gale-force wind that causes the ends to curve into the shape of an integral symbol ∫ and pushes water and food onto the tufts, or (less forcefully) onto the trunk, where the gravity-like tidal forces pull the material out towards the tufts.

>Each tuft serves several main purposes for the tree. First, the green foliage is photosynthetic, providing the tree with energy from sunlight; second, the tufts are where the tree produces its seeds; and third, various plants, animals, and sundry other objects can become trapped in the tighter branches, which gradually migrate toward the ""treemouth."" The treemouth, a pit at the top of each tuft on the lee side of the trunk, is the integral tree's root; water collected along the trunk flows down due to tidal forces and is ingested by the treemouth. Tuft branches catch and capture various things and animals in the wind and gradually, over the course of years, migrate to the treemouth, where they and their catch are absorbed by the tree for nourishment. Many other large Smoke Ring plants have a scavenger/carnivore aspect similar to this, though with somewhat different mechanisms.

While I think Ringworld is a better novel with better characterization, I actually think the setting in The Integral Trees surpasses that of the Ringworld.

While the first book in the series deals with the more primitave civilization that exists within one of the integral trees, The Smoke Ring finds the group from the first novel branching out to surrounding, more advanced civilizations than their own, as well as with the history of the humans that live in the gas torus and how they got there (briefly touched upon in the first book I believe). &&[Children of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25563522-children-of-time) by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  The science centers mostly around evolutionary biology, but there's tons of other topics like gender equality, governance, war, language, intelligence (both biological and artificial), population controls, and more.  It's a really awesome book!&&The Dire Earth Cycle (Darwin Elevator, Exodus Towers, Plague Forge) is one I read recently that held me. It starts out more dystopian future and gets progressively weirder but stays pretty hard sci-fi. 

It's probably a little younger in prose and aim than say dune, but I liked the ideas and environments a lot.

I loved dexters lab as a kid.&&I think it's more cosmic horror/weird fiction still (which can still include more philosophical sci-fi). It's very similar to Roadside Picnic/Stalker, but also H.P. Lovecraft's story The Colour Out of Space, and Area X is basically the exact same sort of place that the protagonists of Algernon Blackwood's The Willows visit. &&man, that really nails why i loved the books. never really made a connection to stuff like Stalker, but the dna is present in those books...especially Annihilation. &&Yep, the whole time I kept thinking this is basically like a Lovecraftian version of Stalker, and it's awesome.&&So I haven't read any of these comparisons people are talking about... Is it the same kind of mysterious sci fi and lack of answers like in the show Lost? (Not writing style or tone, just in general)&&Not really. I don't want to spoil it so I won't go more but I'd say there are more differences than similarities between the JP series and the Southern Reach trilogy.&&I'd say not in the least. &&Not really. It has a similar stye of location, but the writing is very different, especially the first book. Annihilation has more in common with Lovecraft than anything else.

It's a great read and a pretty quick one, so I strongly recommend it. However, if you're really not a fan of the weird it might be offputting.&&It's a tough one. I loved the first book, but the sequals definitely had me saying, ""that was vague and dumb and nothing happened, also I don't give a shit about your mommy issues."" I love the idea of area X. I love the idea of smart, capable people studying area X. I wanted to read about area X as well as read about people actually studying area X and making discoveries. There was very little of what I wanted in the series, but it was there...sometimes. Okay, so there was maybe, in total, an entire chapter's worth of passages that were appealing to me. &&Weird, the 2nd book had me so engaged. When I was done I was ready to dive into the 3rd book, but when I finished I felt underwhelmed.&&interesting, did he really say that? &&I guess...

But those aren't really the questions I had!&&My god, I feel comfortable calling 'the scene' in book 2 an *apotheosis*; everything just felt like it burst open. Which contrasts with book 1 and 3 that lack a similar climax. &&I *just* got to that part yesterday on my second read-through of the trilogy. That scene is just so goddamn haunting, and after that happens the book really takes off. Shit hits the fan. I love it.&&Y'all are lucky you didn't force yourselves to read the third book. Even more disappointing, imo.&&Probably this line - 

>“I did once work on a film called Dredd, which I imagined to be the first part of a trilogy,” says Garland.&&It's more that Dredd didn't sell well, so they weren't making anymore regardless. Now that Garland says it was going to be a trilogy OP's extra sad.&&[I shipped my bed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xwUuSM06xQ)&&It's done well in Fightclub. Edward Norton is credited only as The Narrator.&&I want to say let them be annoyed.  Not knowing names is what adds to the mystery of the story in the books.  But maybe they do need to adjust the story telling a bit for the movie.  I dunno, I just want what I like.&&See, I disagree. I think that there haven't really been any good Lovecraftian visual works, except maybe Bloodborne, but even that fails, because by its very nature Lovecraftian horror is impossible to show visually. Part of what makes it effective is that it lets the reader fill in the gaps with imagined horrors too terrible to describe. The minute you show the horror, no matter how well designed it is (and I thought the monster on Stranger Things was sort of lame) it loses that unknowable factor and therefore any power it had to terrify. By the very nature of being visual storytelling, it's incredibly difficult if not impossible to completely effectively translate a Lovecraftian story like this to screen.    &&Right - I kind of like their intent in showing that idea using visual effects, but the audience was given *no* reason to think that something that bends the laws of physics had taken place, especially since the preceding sci-fi story was pretty grounded. They would've needed an establishing subplot: some theoretical physics development about how your quantum states can blah blah blah to infuse you with the power of the sun without killing you. &&For the most part, yes. There have been test screenings throughout the year so far, and when I saw it back in April, it was about 80% complete.

One of my favorite Lovecraft quotes.&&The entire trilogy is great. I always felt like it flew under the radar of a lot of people. Hopefully the movie will give it its due credit.

Ive never felt so uncomfortable reading something so amazing.&&Make Lovecraft, not Warcraft&&Me too. &&I'd say it's a cross of Lovecraftian horror and Kafkaesque dread with a hefty dose of the Strugazki brother's Roadside Picnic (the novel that the movie [Stalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB7jVTut3-g) is based on, which in turned inspired stuff like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games and the Metro novels/games)&&Lovecraft gets thrown around a lot for a large scope of things. It's used so broadly these days it barely means anything.

To me lovecraft is a type of sci fi horor that triggers a certain type of contemplation existential dread. Some of the things Lovecraft wrote about in his day did this and some of those things today do not.
There's obviously stuff that's done to invoke lovecraft in language and mood and tone to his stories,a nd some that just take the ideas of unknowable horror and extrapolate it.

Stephen King is heavily influenced by lovecraft by usually avoids the sciencey bits I like. Clive Barker is also hugely influenced by lovecraft but again usually avoids the sciencey bits i like for the more imagainative artsy stuff (while king tends to treat his stories as if he is a 15 year old telling you a great dirty joke :)).  Those are just examples, and I like both authors, but they don't tend to scratch the itch this film and story promise to :)&&They had me at Lovecr&&Have you read Roadside Picnic by the Strugazki brothers? I think that's the novel that most closely resembles the Southern Reach trilogy.&&Dune. The hardest of the soft or the softest of the hard, depending on  who you ask. 

I'd also suggest Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space novels. &&This is not going to be like dune at all.  While Dune had mystery, they explained it.  This will be more like Lost, some weird shit happens, and when you expect them to explain, some even weirder shit happens somewhere else, and the explanation never happens.&&So, I love HoL and Southern Reach, and I understand the thematic similarities, but I think that the experience of the works is waaaaay different. HoL is rooted in what we know in proportions and modes that defy our rational experience. Southern reach is rooted in things we fundamentally do not and never will know or understand. I still don't know what the fuck the thing in the third book was. Like, I understand the description of it, but I have no language to describe what it might be in relation to actual things. &&House of Leaves is wonderful, enjoy the experience.&&Will do.

Edit:  read up in it, sounds crazy good!&&In the first book, none of the characters referred to each other by name. The main character was 'the biologist' and the three other scientists also referred to each other by their titles only. A lot of things weren't referred to by specific name; it was a running theme in the book. &&In case you're not joking or anyone else is confused, they mean Andrei Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris), not  Genndy Tartakovsky (Dexter's Lab, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, etc.)&&And Samurai Jack I still love as an adult&&Weird fiction, or Lovecraftian horror, doesn't really offer answers. It offers events that bewilder and upset you, and the best explanations you get are, ""The universe conspires against you."" Sometimes it's aliens, sometimes it's ancient gods, sometimes it's just that the forces of evolution and suffering join hand in hand to fuck your shit up. 

Science Fiction likes to reason with the universe. Aliens have their reasons, and for the most part they're justifiable because life follows predictable patterns. Advanced AI behaves similarly, if with cold and calculated logic, to biological counterparts, because it's just life, and life is predictable.

Weird fiction says, ""Life is weirder than you can imagine. Watch this.""

And then you get creeped out because you've been presented with an idea that you can't account for.  
It's all about the idea that you can look up into the night sky and see the vastness, and know that something is staring back at you. And even though you can't see it, it can see you. And it hates you.&&Honestly, they are a lot of Lost similarities, but it's way trippier and weirder. The lack of answers is due to the thing that people want answers for being incomprehensible to human minds.&&I want it spoiled can you PM me what the spoiler is &&Haha. With you on your opinion of Control. That guy had me eyeball rolling so hard it's a wonder my eyeballs didn't dislocate.&&No idea. I'm basing that on the general tenor of several of his books.&&I seem to recall an interview with him where he explicitly stated that there was no answer to the mystery; the unexplained mystery *was* the whole point of the story.&&Agreed. Also that scene adds so much more to book three too when you find out a little more about him&&I read it at like 1am and could not sleep hahah&&So should I just read the first?&&did this... is that... did that make it to air?

Because that'd be amazing.  Even more amazing&&Didn't Fight Club do badly in the box office though? I'm pretty sure it was considered a good movie only some time after its initial release.&&I agree that true, genuine Lovecraft is all but impossible to present visually. Perhaps if a bored billionaire wants to fund a 40k movie or something, we can get really close via massive scale. However, cosmic horror and weird fiction in general can still work on screen, especially if you never give the audience a full picture or just constantly fuck with it to where it's all but impossible to apply a description that works. The reason I brought up Stranger Things was because it maintained, at least up until the last half of the last episode, a certain about of ""What the fuck am I even looking at?!?"" both with the Demogorgon and the Upside Down in general. I do think Stranger Things made the mistake of giving us the entire thing of the Demogorgon, but ultimately we spent most of the season trying to piece together what it was and what the world it came from was like because even when we got a visual for the Upside Down, the characters were still at a loss for how to describe it. But ultimately, this is a movie sub so we kind of are forced to discuss how something could be down visually, even if it's impossible, I guess.&&Saw it too! Was very trippy&&Saw it about a month ago.  I think it was complete, minus the credits.&&Not sire of what NDAs you might've signed, but would you consider it on par with EX Mach?&&Are you allowed to give an opinion on what you saw?&&Are you allowed to say your thoughts on any level?&&Is that so, mister apple fries?&&You posted this twice, btw.&&what is so odd about that?&&r/Beetlejuicing&&I just read a review that compared it to Lost, where lots of mysteries are set up, but then never explained.  If I hated that aspect of Lost, would I hate this book, or is that an unfair comparison?&&Have you read the Southern Reach Trilogy? I'd say it fits perfectly with the Lovecraftian description. Tons of existenial dread and an exploration of what happens to an individual and the idea of self when encountering something from beyond that is so alien to this world that it cannot be properly described. 

Edit: I type bad on mobile

Plus, no racist subtext!&&As a major Lovecraft fan, *The Southern Reach* is the most Lovecraftian non-Lovecraft work I have ever read.&&To me Lovecraftian means, yeah, a dread. But also just uncanny and unexplainable. Like there is a (sometimes evil) vastness which is beyond our comprehension. That's what I get from reading Lovecraft anyways. &&Had me at Lo&&Well yeah I've read Dune and a few of the follow ups.  

I'm talking more like Land OF The Lost, Jurassic Park. That kinda stuff. Something where scientists or whatever discover an island or place that time kinda forgot lol&&Alastair Reynolds will eventually be recognized as on the same playing field as Herbert, Asimov, Clarke and Brin...if he hasn't already.
&&I read the first book of this series, but it just seemed like a whole lotta nuthin. Never really went anywhere or said anything. I guess I'm just dumb. && House of Leaves is the definition of existential dread! &&Yeah i was just making a joke cause the names are similar :P&&And for those wondering, yes that’s the same Stalker the game is very loosely based off of. &&Wow you just perfectly described why I hated this trilogy. Well done. Nothing wrong with them if you're into that sort of thing though. I'll probably check out the movie only because I reckon it would be impossible for them to be fully faithful to the books without be incoherent in that medium (hence they already have names for the scientists).&&Yep, in retrospect I kinda wish I had treated it as just one book. I don't mind lots of unanswered questions after a slim but fascinating 250 pages. It's a lot more frustrating after 800+&&I think you're right.&&Lol, that's the one thing I've heard from pre-sceenings consistently. It's supposed to be a fucking triiip and a half.&&Here's my brief opinion. I thought Ex Machina was great, but not as amazing as some others say it is. That said, I really enjoyed Annihilation, albeit some flaws I can't talk about. They're two films that are hard to compare, but I'd say they're on par with one another&&Pomme de Terre-- earth apple, aka potato.

&&Correction. Mr. Potatoe fries. That is all&&Watch out it's the unknowable horror of Lovecraft!!!&&Is that good or bad? &&Well, I'd say it's not really comparable since with Lost, the mystery was the story and some sort of answer was promised from the beginning, while here, the alien presence that changes everything in Area X is pretty much unknowable from the beginning. The story is more about how the characters deal with it. It's almost kafkaesque since they are trying to understand something which they know is probably impossible to understand, but try anyway.&&The Colour out of Space?&&> existenial dread

Can one of you tell me what existenial dread is?

It's really driving me nuts. I mean I've heard of existential dread, but several people have mentioned existenial dread and now I think I must be missing something.

;)&&I agree with your description of the Southern Reach, but argue that it is not very Lovecraftian. One of the key features of a Lovecraftian story is that the protagonist learns how utterly insignificant the entire human race is (the entire world is!) in it's place in the universe. I do not get that from Annihilation. In fact, the mind of the explorers seems to actually be part of the wierdness in the reach.&&Check out Arthur Machen.&&I gues in thinking about it I mean by sci fi, that the story/writer has done the due deligience as Lovecraft did in his day of thoughtfully and intelligently painting around the unknown in an interesting way, instead of just ""it was an unknowable thing... and it had some tentacles"". And I think Lovecraft's due deligence back in his day put authors to shame these days.&&Dawn by Octavia Butler. Not scientists discovering an island or whatever, but still is probably the kind of story you would enjoy. It's an excellent book. &&The Island of Dr. Moreau maybe.  This isnt a book or hard sci-fi, but the podcast Tanis reminded me of the southern reach. Spooky stuff for your October.&&Have you read the Rama series by Arthur C. Clarke? I feel it goes off the rails a bit in the later books, but Rendezvous with Rama is pretty good, as is Rama II.

Greg Egan's Orthogonal series is also good if you want a really alien perspective on space/time travel, since it takes place in a different universe with different laws of physics.

The majority of Ursula K. Le Guin's Hainish Cycle (all standalone novels) is all about understanding future human, post-human, and alien civilizations.&&Fragment by Warren Fahy is right up your alley.&&Ring word. Larry Niven. All about discovery. &&I do need to get back to them, but his books are real door stoppers. I think I trailed off somewhere in the first third of Redemption Ark.&&Yeah, but I found it rooted in the physical, not the esoteric like southern reach is. HoL is about exploring hallways and staircases, and is rooted in documentation of that exploration. It exist as a reflection of the physical ability to capture the events. Southern reach is defined by the things that defy physical understanding. &&And I used that opportunity to tell people about two of my favorite media creators. Tag-team high-five! &&The foundation is that in science fiction, even if you don't know everything, it's presumed that you *could* understand it, given time and focus.

Weird fiction is based on the presumption that some things are not quantifiable. Some things go beyond your reasoning. Some things just are, and maybe there are answers, but if you fully grasped them, it would warp you into something also beyond recognition. To change your understanding would be to change your entire being. 

There's something religious in that idea. Something spiritual that science fiction lacks. I think that's an element that is important to story telling, if you want it to really get to people. Horror doesn't come from a sense of disgust. Disgust means you understand something, and are grossed out by it. Horror means it drives you mad just trying to wrap your head around it. 

You know how the bible says that ""The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom?"" I think it's the same thing here. To really understand the unknowable, you just have to accept that it's beyond your comprehension. Work with what you've got, but don't try to quantify it so hard. It'll only frustrate you, because it is literally bigger than your ability to comprehend. The fear of the unknown doesn't come from the fact that we might understand it, but from the belief that it's impossible to ever fully understand. &&How does someone get pulled aside for such screenings?&&The Farsi word for potato is pronounced seeb-zamin, 'seeb' meaning apple and 'zamin' meaning ground

Ground apple.    &&Good. Most of time. Definitely good in this instance. &&Yeah, I would say it's similar. Even though it's presented as a kind of detached and aloof narrative in that Lovecraft-style, it ends up being intensely personal, though. It's similar in that there's a group of people trying to study a mysterious tract of land, and we never really know what's actually happening in the Southern Reach outside of how it effects its surroundings. 

I can't recommend Annihilation enough. It's a very short read, too. My advice is to start there and if you like it read the other two. Fair warning, though, the second book takes a while to really get moving, and there is a huge perspective shift between the first and second book that's a little jarring. The third book does an awesome job tying everything together, though!&&It's basically an undefined sense of dread arising from awareness of one's own mortality or sense of smallness or meaningless in the grand scheme of things. &&To me, it is the feeling of utter detachment from one's ego that one might get in the face of an unfeeling, supremely powerful, and unknowable force which is working towards your complete annihilation for no reason at all, and the gutteral fear that engenders in us as humans interested in our own survival.   
  
It is almost a split in the mind where you see yourself simultaneously from a universal perspective, recognizing the futility of your existence in the face of the vastness of time and space, and from the extremely local perspective which demands you strive for your own survival in the now at all costs. The two feelings clash in the mind, creating a dissonance which becomes physically uncomfortable. When it has hit me, it has felt like a nightmare scream in my chest that I can't let out.  Each perspective vying against the other, but the whole of my attention focusing on the finality of my own demise, and the meaningless-ness of everything at the heat death of the universe.  
  
That is my attempt at describing what I think of as existential dread.  &&I would argue that the weirdness in the mind of the explorers, like the typical Lovecraft character stems from those character's contact with the unknowable. I definitely see your point, though.&&Read the description, sounds awesome. Added to cart! Thanks kind stranger&&Read it. A classic seriously &&+1 to the Rama series, great set of books.  I'd also vote for some of Niven's stuff, especially the Ringworld series.&&I'm pretty sure I have Rendezvous with Rama on the shelve, gotta check. 

Will look into rest thank you!&&Currently reading it actually :)&&Just a comment to say you I love your attitude and positive vibe :) 
Rock on! &&You've gotta know people, plain and simple.&&Has to pass the Turing test&&",2017-09-26 10:31:34
